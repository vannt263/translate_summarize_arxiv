    "more than 400 galactic sources with extended emission at 4.5 @xmath6 m were identified @xcite .",
    "these objects were called extended green objects ( egos ) for the common coding of the 4.5 @xmath6 m band as green in three - color composite infrared array camera images from the _ spitzer _ telescope . according to the authors ,",
    "an ego is a probable massive young stellar object ( myso ) driving outflows . the extended emission in the 4.5 @xmath6 m band is supposed to be due to h@xmath0 ( @xmath7 , s(9,10,11 ) ) lines and co ( @xmath8 ) band heads , that are excited by the shock of the outflows propagating in the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "some studies have shown that egos indeed trace outflows related to mysos @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , based on the lack of detection of the shock - excited h@xmath0 line at 2.122 @xmath6 m towards several egos , @xcite suggest that the 4.5 @xmath6 m emission can also be due to scattered light . studying the molecular ambient towards egos",
    "is useful not only to probe the relationship between the 4.5 @xmath6 m extended emission and shocked gas but also to study how ysos can disrupt their surrounding environment , through the clearing of gas and the injection of momentum and energy onto the medium .",
    "indeed , bipolar jets from protostars appear to be ubiquitous and to have a close relationship to the accretion process from a disc into a forming star @xcite .",
    "these jets can excavate cavities by sweeping up the molecular material which then forms an outflow that can be detected through the emission of co lines .",
    "we are performing a systematic study of the ism around egos in order to find evidence of outflowing activity and to characterize the molecular ambient where the source is embedded . in this paper",
    "we present the results from the study of ego g35.04 - 047    the source ego g35.04 - 047 lays in a border of the hii region g035.0 - 0.5 .",
    "figure [ present ] is a three - color _ spitzer_-irac composite image of the field , where the hii region g035.0 - 0.5 appears conspicuous at the 8 @xmath6 m emission and the ego g35.04 - 0.47 , located in a dark cavity at the northern - west edge of the hii region , can be distinguished by its 4.5 @xmath6 m green emission .",
    "the hii region has a systemic velocity of v@xmath9 51 km s@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "ego g35.04 - 0.47 is very likely embedded in the dark cloud sdc g35.041 - 0.471 @xcite suggesting that it could be an yso evolving in its parental dark and dense cloud .",
    "moreover , it is probable that the formation of this yso has been triggered by the expansion of the hii region g035.0 - 0.5 .",
    "it is likely that the shock front of the hii region has overrun and compressed a preexisting molecular clump leading the formation of the yso ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite detected class i 95 ghz methanol maser at the center of this ego with a main component centered at 51.5 km s@xmath4 , in agreement with a previous single - pointing study using the hco@xmath3 , @xmath1co , @xmath2co , and c@xmath10o j=10 lines @xcite .",

    "in particular , this ego shows near - ir emission extending mainly towards the southwest .",
    "@xcite using near - ir data from the ukidss @xcite confirmed the presence of a bipolar h@xmath0 jet detected at 2.122 @xmath6 m , with a strong component towards the southwest of the ego and not aligned with the 4.5 @xmath6 m emission .",
    "the yellow ellipses in figure [ present ] ( right ) schematically represent the lobes of the bipolar h@xmath0 jet .",
    "the authors catalogued this object as the molecular hydrogen emission - line object mho 2429 .",
    "mhos are spatially resolved objects associated with outflows from young stars @xcite .",
    "based on new submillimeter molecular observations acquired with the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) , we present a study of the ism towards ego g35.04 - 0.47 in order to characterize the molecular gas probably related to the star - forming processes .",
    "we mainly analyze the ism southwards the ego with the goal of confirming the existence of a molecular outflow related to the strong southwestern h@xmath0 jet .",
    "additionally , we study the nature of the driving source .",
    "the molecular observations presented in this work were carried out on june 12 and 13 , 2011 with the 10 m atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ; @xcite ) .",
    "we used the cats345 ghz band receiver , which is a two - single band sis receiver remotely tunable in the lo frequency range of 324 - 372 ghz .",

    ". therefore , our analysis focus on the components that appear between 34 and 60 km s@xmath4 . within this velocity range ,",

    "it is probable that some of these components arise from a blueshifted outflow related to the southwestern h@xmath0 structure found by @xcite .",
    "this issue will be further studied in section [ mapping ] .",

    "the position of ego g35.04 - 0.47 coincides with the molecular clump that appears northwards in the panels from 53.8 to 50.6 km s@xmath4 , peaking at about 51 km s@xmath4 . at lower velocities ,",
    "see panels between 48.4 and 46.2 km s@xmath4 , there is an elongated molecular feature aligned with the southwestern h@xmath0 jet mapped by @xcite ( see mainly panel at 47.3 km s@xmath4 ) .",

    "@xcite we assume an isotope abundance ratio @xmath35 [ @xmath1co]/[@xmath2co ] of 50 to obtain n(@xmath1co ) @xmath36 @xmath34 .",
    "the hco@xmath3 column density was derived from : @xmath37 and by considering that the hco@xmath3 j=43 is optically thick , we use a ` cannonical ' optical depth of @xmath38 and an excitation temperature of 43 k , which corresponds to the equivalent temperature of the molecular transition , to obtain n(hco@xmath3 ) @xmath39 @xmath34 .    to independently estimate a value for the h@xmath0 column density , we use the millimeter continuum flux at 1.1 mm measured in the bolocam galactic plane survey towards the source bgps g35.045 - 0.478 @xcite , which is related to the molecular clump analyzed in this study .",
    "using n(h@xmath40 s_{1.1}$ ] @xmath34",
    "@xcite with the flux density obtained from the 40  aperture ( s@xmath41 jy ) , which seems appropriate for the dimensions of the molecular clump , considering a dust temperature of @xmath42 13 k , and applying the multiplicative correction factors of 1.46 and 1.5 for the point source aperture and flux density , respectively @xcite , we derive n(h@xmath43 @xmath34 .",
    "then , using this value , we obtain the following molecular abundances : x(@xmath1co ) @xmath44 , x(@xmath2co ) @xmath45 , and x(hco@xmath3 ) @xmath46 . the derived @xmath1co and @xmath2co abundances are in agreement with the ` standard ' value for dark clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) , while hco@xmath3 abundance is similar to the values obtained towards high - mass star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "given that the @xmath1co is a good tracer of molecular outflows towards ysos ( e.g. @xcite ) , we carefully analyze this line in order to find a possible counterpart for the southwestern h@xmath0 jet mapped by @xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , the @xmath1co spectrum displayed in figure [ spectra ] shows a likely wing towards lower velocities with several components , being probable that some of them arise from a blueshifted outflow related to the southwestern h@xmath0 structure . to confirm the presence of outflows or high velocity material moving along the line of sight we compare the @xmath1co emission with the higher density tracer line hco@xmath3 j=43 .",
    "figure [ compara ] presents the @xmath1co and hco@xmath3 spectra obtained towards the ego g35.04 - 0.47 position .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the range where @xmath1co emission is detected at lower velocities with respect to the hco@xmath3 , showing the presence of a @xmath1co spectral wing , which may be due to a blueshifted outflow extending from 34.0 to 47.4 km s@xmath4 .",
    "it is probable that within this velocity range there is also some molecular emission unrelated to the outflow activity and likely associated with the extended hii region and/or to the dark cloud .",
    "thus , the derived outflow parameters using this range must be considered as upper limits . on the other side , none signature of gas moving at higher velocities ( i.e. a probable redshifted outflow ) is observed .",
    "figure [ outflowall ] shows the @xmath1co j=32 emission integrated between 34.0 and 47.4 km s@xmath4  ( in blue with white contours ) .",
    "two molecular clumps peak in this velocity range , one towards the ego g35.04 - 0.47 position , and the other one , located towards the south , probably related to the dark cloud sdc g35.027 - 0.481 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1co emission towards the left side of the image is very likely related to the hii region border . in order to roughly estimate the outflow mass , we again assume lte and derive the @xmath1co optical depth @xmath47 from ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the isotope abundance ratio .",
    "we use the peak temperature ratio between the co isotopes obtained from the components centered at @xmath50 km s@xmath4 , deriving @xmath51 . in this case , equation ( [ eq2 ] ) gives an excitation temperature of t@xmath52 k. finally , integrating between 34.0 and 47.4 km s@xmath4 the following equation : @xmath53 we obtain a total column density n(@xmath1co ) @xmath54 @xmath34 .",
    "this value results from the summation of column densities calculated at two different positions : two separated beams along the co structure related to the ego .",
    "then , we use @xmath55 to derive the total mass of the co outflow . in this equation @xmath6",
    "is the mean molecular weight which was assumed to be 2.8 by taking into account a relative helium abundance of 25 % , m@xmath56 is the hydrogen mass , @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the distance assumed to be 3.4 kpc , and the area of the molecular structure was approximated with an ellipse with semi - axes of 20  and 12 .",
    "the total mass for the co outflow calculated in this way is 21 m@xmath59 .",
    "then we obtain a momentum of p @xmath60 m@xmath59  km s@xmath4 , and an energy of e @xmath61 erg , where @xmath62 is the inclination angle of the outflow , which is uncertain .",
    "as explained above , these values must be considered upper limits since it is possible that some @xmath1co emission towards the ego is not actually related with the outflow activity .    by inspecting channel per channel the @xmath1co j=32 cube in the velocity range from 34.0 to 47.4 km s@xmath4 , we find that the most conspicuous co counterpart of the h@xmath0 emission southwest lobe peaks between 46 and 47 km s@xmath4 .",
    "figure [ outflow ] ( up ) , shows the integration of the @xmath1co in this velocity range , where it can be observed an elongated clump ( see the structure delimited by the 3.1 k km s@xmath4  contour ) aligned with the mho southwest lobe . towards the southwest ( bottom right corner of the image ) appears another molecular clump probably not related to the outflow .",
    "figure [ outflow ] ( bottom ) displays the emission channel maps from 45.9 to 47.1 km s@xmath4 in intervals of 0.11 km s@xmath4 .",
    "comparing both panels of figure [ outflow ] , it can be appreciated that the shape and alignment of the co structure is totally in agreement with that of the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "if we use the velocity range displayed in figure [ outflow ] ( @xmath25v @xmath21 1 km s@xmath4 ) to derive the outflow parameters , we obtain a mass of about 9 m@xmath59 , momentum p @xmath63 m@xmath59  km s@xmath4 , and energy e @xmath64 erg .",
    "therefore , taking into account these results and those presented above , we conclude that the parameters of the blueshifted outflow , correlated with the southwest lobe mapped in h@xmath0 should be within the following ranges : mass between 9 and 21 m@xmath59 , momentum : @xmath65 m@xmath59  km s@xmath4 , and energy : @xmath66 erg . in the following section we study the nature of the outflow driving source .",
    "ego g35.04 - 0.47 is embedded in a dusty clump mapped by the bolocam , catalogued as source bgps g035.045 - 00.478 , which has a deconvolved radius of about 98  @xcite .",

    ", we obtain a total mass of about 1900 m@xmath59  for bgps g035.045 - 00.478 , indicating that the ego is embedded in a massive cloud .",
    "figure [ mips ] ( right ) shows a zoom towards the ego position displaying the irac 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath6 m emissions in green and red , respectively .",
    "it can be seen two spitzer sources very close each other , being the ego counterpart the northern one , this is the source , sstglmc g035.0399 - 00.4729 . to better characterize the nature of this source we performed a fitting of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) using the on - line tool developed by @xcite .",

    "to construct this sed we use fluxes extracted from : ukidss - dr6 galactic plane survey @xcite at k band , source ugps j185658.10 + 013936.6 ; glimpse source catalog @xcite at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath6 m , source sstglmc g035.0399 - 00.4729 ; wise all - sky source catalog at 12 and 22  @xmath6 m , source wise j185658.14 + 013937.1 ; pacs ( bands at 70 and 160 @xmath6 m ) and spire ( at 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath6 m ) from herschel , and finally bolocam at 1.1 mm , source bgps g035.045 - 00.478 .",

    "fluxes from spire and bolocam were considered as upper limits .",
    "table [ sedtable ] presents a weighted mean of each constrained physical parameter and the range arising from the good - fitting models .",
    "the weight used for the weighted means is the inverse of the @xmath75 of each model .",
    "the sed analysis of ego g35.04 - 0.47 suggests that the central object is an intermediate mass young stellar object ( @xmath76 m@xmath77 ) with an envelope accretion rate of about 10@xmath78 m@xmath77 yr@xmath4 , similar to the mass accretion rates found in a sample of mysos by @xcite .",
    "chen et al . ( 2010,2013 ) studied several egos and obtained mass infall rates ranging from @xmath79 to @xmath80 m@xmath77yr@xmath4 .",
    "thus , taking into account the accretion rate , the outflow parameters found in our molecular study , and the presence of a massive clump of cold dust ( reservoir of a large amount of matter ) we suggest that the central object may continue to accrete mass and it probably will become a massive yso .",

    "using new molecular line observations obtained with aste we studied the ambient around the young stellar object ego g35.04 - 0.47 .",

    "<S> therefore , the source was catalogued as the molecular hydrogen emission - line object mho 2429 . in order to study the molecular ambient towards this star - forming site , we observed a region around the aforementioned ego using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment in the @xmath1co j=32 , @xmath2co j=32 , hco@xmath3 j=43 , and cs j=76 lines with an angular and spectral resolution of 22  and 0.11 km s@xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the observations revealed a molecular clump where the ego is embedded at v@xmath5 km s@xmath4 , in coincidence with the velocity of a class i 95 ghz methanol maser previously detected . analyzing the @xmath1co line we discovered high velocity molecular gas in the range from 34 to 47 km s@xmath4 , most likely a blueshifted outflow driven by the ego . </S>",
    "<S> the alignment and shape of this molecular structure coincide with those of the southwest lobe of mho 2429 mainly between 46 and 47 km s@xmath4 , confirming that we are mapping its co counterpart . performing a sed analysis of ego g35.04 - 0.47 we found that its central object should be an intermediate - mass young stellar object accreting mass at a rate similar to those found in some massive ysos . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this source can become a massive yso . </S>"
