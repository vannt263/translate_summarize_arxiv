    "observational studies of galaxy evolution generally rely on the investigation of statistical properties such as luminosity functions , correlation functions , distribution functions of mass and emission - line equivalent widths , as functions of redshift from @xmath17 to the highest redshift , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we should explore the highest-@xmath14 universe and construct a highest-@xmath14 galaxy sample .",
    "recently , two alternative methods are often used to find high-@xmath14 galaxies .",
    "one is to search for objects with a lyman - break feature due to intergalactic absorption seen as a strong photometric discontinuity in the rest - frame uv stellar continuum spectrum ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ; madau et al .",
    "1996 ; lowenthal et al .",
    "the other is to search for objects with a strong ly@xmath0 emission caused by massive stars using narrow passband filters ( see for a review , taniguchi et al .",
    "the high-@xmath14 galaxies found in such ways are called `` lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) '' and `` ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) '' , respectively .",
    "these high-@xmath14 galaxy surveys are now bringing us a sample of galaxies at @xmath18 or the end of `` the cosmic dark age '' ( e.g. , miralda - escud 2003 ; djorgovski 2004 ) .",
    "recent narrow - band surveys pick up laes at @xmath19 through an atmospheric window at @xmath20 ( e.g. , hu et al . 2002 ; kodaira et al . 2003 ; rhoads et al . 2004 ; taniguchi et al . 2005 ) , and recent broad - band surveys pick up `` @xmath3-dropout galaxies '' as candidates of galaxies at @xmath21 , which are characterized by a very red @xmath22 color due to a lyman - break spectral feature ( e.g. , stanway et al . 2003 ; bouwens et al . 2003 , 2004 ; dickinson et al . 2004 ; bunker et al . 2004 ) .",
    "in order to investigate the nature of such high-@xmath14 galaxy populations , follow - up spectroscopy is crucially important .",
    "recently , nagao et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported the discovery of an interesting object among 48 @xmath3-dropout galaxies detected in the subaru deep field ( sdf24@xmath2338@xmath249 , + 27@xmath2529@xmath2625@xmath279 ) ( j2000.0 ) .",

    "2005 for details ) , shows a very strong ly@xmath0 emission at 8909@xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath28 , whose rest - frame equivalent width is as large as @xmath29 .",
    "however , this object does not show strong uv stellar continuum that is expected for @xmath3-dropout galaxies .",
    "thus the flux detected in the @xmath7 image is largely ( @xmath3040% ) attributed to the ly@xmath0 emission , giving a very red @xmath22 color .",
    "this discovery is important because only @xmath30 1% of broad - band selected lbgs at @xmath31 show strong ly@xmath0 emission with @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) @xmath33 100@xmath6 ( shapley et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the finding of sdf j132440.6 + 273607 among such a small sample of @xmath3-dropout galaxies may suggest that an @xmath3-dropout sample contains strong laes much more frequently than a lbg sample at a redshift of @xmath303 .    to study this issue further , we focus on the 48 @xmath3-dropout objects found in sdf .",
    "this is because we have not only deep @xmath3 and @xmath7 images but also a narrow - band image of nb921 [ ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) = ( 9196@xmath6 , 132@xmath6 ) ; the transmission curves of these filters are shown in figure 1 ] .",
    "this enables us to obtain information about the sed of the @xmath3-dropout galaxies . as for sdf j132440.6 + 273607 , due to the strong ly@xmath0 emission in the @xmath7 band ( but out of the nb921 band ) , a significant `` nb921 depression '' is seen ; i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "interestingly , among the 48 @xmath3-dropout objects in sdf , there are seven other objects with a nb921 depression with significance larger than 2@xmath37 of the sky noise ( note that the significance level of nb921 depression for sdf j132440.6 + 273607 is slightly below 2@xmath37 ) . if all of these 7 objects are really similar objects ( i.e. , high-@xmath14 galaxies with very large @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) ) , sdf j132440.6 + 273607 would not be exceptional in the @xmath3-dropout population .",
    "this might suggest a strong redshift evolution of the @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) distribution from @xmath21 to @xmath31 although it should be kept in mind that @xmath31 lbgs and @xmath21 @xmath3-dropout galaxies are not selected by the same criteria .    in this paper , we report the results of our new spectroscopy of two @xmath3-dropout objects with a significant nb921 depression . throughout this paper ,",

    "( 2004 ) for details of the sdf imaging observations .",
    "the spectra of sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 were obtained on 23 april 2004 ( ut ) .",
    "the 830 lines / mm grating and the gg495 order - sorting filter were used .",
    "the resulting wavelength coverage was @xmath47 , with a dispersion of 0.47 @xmath6/pixel .",
    "the adopted slit width was 1.0 arcsec , which gave a spectral resolution of @xmath48 at 8500@xmath6 , which is measured by the widths of atmospheric oh emission lines .",
    "the total integration time was 7929 sec for sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and 7058 sec for sdf j132442.5 + 272423 .",
    "the weather was clear and photometric , and the typical seeing size was 0.7  1.0 arcsec during the observation .",
    "we also obtained spectra of a spectrophotometric standard star feige 110 ( oke 1990 ) for the flux calibration .",
    "the obtained data were reduced by the deep2 deimos data reduction software , the spec2d pipeline .",
    "in figure 3 , the sky - subtracted optical spectra are plotted with a typical sky spectrum .",
    "both objects show a single strong emission line , with peak wavelengths of 8540@xmath6 and 8560@xmath6 for sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 , respectively .",
    "no continuum emission is detected for both objects .",
    "both emission lines show a clear asymmetric profile ; i.e. , a sharp decline on the blue side and a prominent tail on the red side of the line .",
    "spiky features redward of the emission line of sdf j132426.5 + 271600 seem to be the residuals of the sky emission .",
    "the redward tails extend to @xmath49 and @xmath50 for sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 respectively . to quantify the asymmetry of the lines",
    ", we measured the flux ratio between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath51 is the flux at wavelengths longer than the peak while @xmath52 is that at wavelengths shorter .",
    "the measured ratios are @xmath53 and @xmath54 for sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 respectively , which are significantly larger than unity , although the spiky noise redward of the emission line of sdf j132426.5 + 271600 would affect the ratio .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation that the detected emission line is ly@xmath0 , not any other emission line ( see taniguchi et al .",
    "the observed line - shape asymmetry and the photometric properties strongly suggest that sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 are at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that no other emission lines are detected for both objects , because h@xmath0 , h@xmath57 , or [ oiii]@xmath585007 emitters at @xmath59 , @xmath60 , or @xmath61 ( which are possible candidates for line emitters at @xmath62 ) should show [ oiii ] at @xmath63 , [ oiii ] at @xmath64 or h@xmath57 at @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the possibility that the observed objects are [ oii ] emitters at @xmath66 is rejected by the obtained emission - line profiles , because the expected wavelength separation of the [ oii ] doublet for objects at @xmath67 is @xmath68 , which should be resolved by our wavelength resolution of @xmath48 . note that the wavelength separation of the emission - line peak and the spiky feature redward of the emission line of sdf j132426.5 + 271600 is @xmath69 , rather larger than the separation expected for the [ oii ] doublet from an object at @xmath67 .",
    "we also note that the @xmath22 color of foreground galaxies at @xmath70 is expected to be bluer than 1.5 mag , even when the sed of passively evolved elliptical - type galaxies is assumed ( e.g. , stanway et al .",
    "we thus conclude that the observed two objects are strong laes at @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    adopting these redshifts ,",
    "the nv@xmath581240 emission would be expected at @xmath71 if these two objects are agns at @xmath10 .",
    "however , no such emission - line features are seen in this wavelength for either object ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the 3@xmath37 upper limit for the nv@xmath581240 emission is @xmath72 ergs s@xmath42 @xmath73 and @xmath74 ergs s@xmath42 @xmath73 for sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 respectively .",
    "however , we can not reject the possibility that these two objects are agns only by these weak constraints on the nv@xmath581240 fluxes .",
    "indeed it is known that some high-@xmath14 narrow - line radio galaxies show very weak nv@xmath581240 emission compared with ly@xmath0 ( e.g. , de breuck et al .",
    "2000 ; nagao et al .",
    "in order to examine this issue further , follow - up spectroscopy in the near - infrared is required to see some high - ionization emission lines such as civ@xmath581549 attributed to agn . despite this uncertainty , however , we regard these two observed objects as star forming galaxies but not agns in the following analysis and discussion .",
    "the ly@xmath0 fluxes of sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 are @xmath75 ergs s@xmath42 @xmath73 and @xmath76 ergs s@xmath42 @xmath73 , respectively , giving ly@xmath0 luminosities of @xmath77 ergs s@xmath42 and @xmath78 ergs s@xmath42 ( where the slit losses are not taken into account ) .",
    "the measured emission - line widths of sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 are @xmath79 and @xmath80 in full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , corresponding to 410 km s@xmath42 and 220 km s@xmath42 where the instrumental broadening effect is quadratically corrected .",
    "the estimated line widths at zero intensity ( fwzi ) are @xmath81 and @xmath82 , corresponding to 1030 km s@xmath42 and 770 km s@xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the measured spectroscopic properties of the two observed objects are summarized in table 2 .    while the @xmath5-band flux is attributed only to the stellar uv continuum emission ,",
    "the @xmath7-band fluxes of the two observed objects apparently contain much ly@xmath0 flux .",
    "the estimated fractions of the @xmath7-band flux contributed by ly@xmath0 are @xmath83 and @xmath84 for j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 , respectively .",
    "the uv continuum flux densities derived from the @xmath5 magnitudes are @xmath85 ergs s@xmath42 @xmath73 @xmath86 and @xmath87 ergs s@xmath42 @xmath73 @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "we then estimate the ly@xmath0-subtracted @xmath7-band magnitude , by subtracting the spectroscopically measured ly@xmath0 flux from the @xmath7-band flux .",
    "note that this procedure may result in an over - subtraction due to a short - wavelength cutoff of the @xmath7-filter transmission .",
    "the estimated magnitudes are @xmath88 and @xmath89 for sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 , respectively .",
    "these magnitudes are nearly the same as the @xmath5 magnitudes within the range of @xmath90 mag .",
    "this result suggests that the nb921 depression is caused mainly by the contribution of the ly@xmath0 flux into the @xmath7-band flux .    for narrow - band selected high-@xmath14 laes , it is sometimes difficult to estimate @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) because the measurements of continuum flux on the low - s / n spectra are generally very hard .",
    "indeed only upper - limits to the uv continuum flux density and resulting lower limits to @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) have been obtained for such laes in most of the previous high-@xmath14 ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) lae studies ( e.g. , kodaira et al .",
    "2003 ; kurk et al .",
    "2004 ; taniguchi et al .",
    "however , for sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 , we can estimate @xmath91(ly@xmath0 ) rather straightforwardly by referring to the @xmath5-band flux to determine the continuum levels , if we assume a flat uv sed .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath92(ly@xmath0 ) are 660 @xmath6 and 1659 @xmath6 , giving @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) = 94 @xmath6 and @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) = 236 @xmath6 for sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 , respectively .",
    "note that if the detected emission lines were [ oii]@xmath583727 , the rest - frame equivalent widths would be 288@xmath6 and 724@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "these values are implausibly large for low-@xmath14 [ oii ] emitters ( e.g. , ajiki et al .",
    "2005 ) , which also supports our interpretation that the detected emission lines are ly@xmath0 . here",
    "we mention that the derived @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) for sdf j132442.5 + 272423 is the largest one among the spectroscopically identified galaxies ever known at @xmath11 .",
    "although sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 turned out to be strong laes at @xmath10 , it does not necessarily mean that all of the nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout objects are similar strong laes .",
    "we point out that there are three possibilities for the nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout objects ; galactic very late - type stars , nb921-dropout galaxies at @xmath13 , and strong ly@xmath0 emitters at @xmath12 . to understand the nature of the observed objects selected by the criterion `` nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout ''",
    ", we discuss each possibility below .",
    "objects selected by @xmath3-dropout criterion are not necessarily high-@xmath14 galaxies ; sometimes galactic late - type stars contaminate in @xmath3-dropout samples ( e.g. , stanway et al .",
    "the nb921 depression might be accompanied with such late - type stars owing to their strong and complex molecular absorption spectral features .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile to examine whether such galactic late - type stars can be selected as nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout objects before considering the possibility that they are really very high-@xmath14 galaxies . in figure 4 ,",
    "the photometric properties of the nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout objects are compared with those of galactic stars on a @xmath46 versus @xmath22 color - color diagram .",
    "here we use gunn & stryker ( 1983 ) for photometric properties of galactic m type and earlier , and kirkpatrick ( 2003 ) for those of l and t dwarf stars .",
    "this figure shows that galactic l and t dwarfs exhibit red @xmath22 color ( @xmath4 ) and thus are selected as @xmath3-dropout objects , but none of them exhibit significant nb921 depression .",
    "the bluest @xmath46 color of the l and t dwarfs is @xmath93 , which is too red to reproduce the observed nb921 depressions seen in our @xmath3-dropout subsample . although the possibility that galactic stars are included in the nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout sample can not be completely discarded when taking the photometric uncertainties into account , figure 5 suggests that late - type galactic stars are not a dominant population in the nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout sample .",
    "we now consider the second possibility that the nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout galaxies are `` nb921-dropout galaxies '' , i.e. , galaxies at @xmath13 and thus the lyman - break feature drops at a longer wavelength than the nb921 band .",
    "see shioya et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for general discussion on nb921-dropout galaxies . to see the photometric properties of the nb921-dropout galaxies quantitatively ,",
    "theoretically calculated @xmath46 color is plotted as a function of redshift in figure 5 .",
    "the adopted stellar spectrum is created by the stellar population model galaxev ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) assuming a stellar metallicity of @xmath94 , a salpeter initial mass function ( @xmath95 ) , and an exponentially decaying star - formation history with the timescale of @xmath96 gyr and the age of 1 gyr .",
    "although no dust reddening is taken into account for models shown in figure 6 , a moderate amount of the reddening does not affect the @xmath46 color significantly ; a dust reddening of @xmath97 mag changes the @xmath46 color less than @xmath98 mag .",
    "models with @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) = 0 , 65 , 130 , and 260 @xmath6 are plotted in the figure .",
    "as shown in figure 5 , significant nb921 depressions can be caused at the redshift range of @xmath99 due to the combination of the absorption of the @xmath5 flux by the intergalactic matter and the contribution of the ly@xmath0 contribution into the @xmath7-band flux .",
    "however , the @xmath7-band flux of galaxies at @xmath13 decreases so significantly that the detection of such nb921-dropout galaxies is very difficult . in figure 6 ,",
    "the expected @xmath7 magnitude of galaxies with an absolute magnitude of @xmath100 is shown as a function of redshift .",
    "the adopted seds are the same as those in figure 6 .",
    "it is clearly shown that the @xmath7-band flux is decreasing at @xmath13 , especially for the galaxies with no or weak ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "shioya et al .",
    "( 2005 ) predicted the expected number of nb921-dropout galaxies in the fov of the sdf .",
    "they reported that the expected number of nb921-dropout galaxies with @xmath43 mag is @xmath1010.03 if a starburst sed without ly@xmath0 is assumed and @xmath1011.2 if @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) = 65 @xmath6 is assumed ( here a uv luminosity function at @xmath10 reported by bouwens et al .",
    "2004 is adopted ) .",
    "this suggests that the nb921-dropout galaxies ( i.e. , galaxies at @xmath13 ) are at most a minor population in the nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout sample .      for the two laes presented in this paper and another lae reported by nagao et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the nb921 depression of the nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout objects can be attributed to the large ly@xmath0 contribution in the @xmath7-band flux if the strong lae is in proper redshift range .",
    "as shown in figure 5 , the @xmath46 color is not affected by ly@xmath0 at @xmath102 because ly@xmath0 is out of the @xmath7 band . at @xmath12 ,",
    "the nb921 depression is caused by a contribution of strong ly@xmath0 emission into the @xmath7-band .",
    "indeed we carried out spectroscopy of the three such objects in the sdf ( two in this paper and one in nagao et al .",
    "2004 ; see figure 2 ) and all of the three objects now turn out to be strong laes with @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) @xmath103 at the redshift range of @xmath12 . since galactic late - type dwarfs and",
    "nb921-dropout galaxies at @xmath13 are thought not to be a dominant populations in the nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout objects , most of the nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout galaxies seem to be strong laes , and their nb921 depression seems to be caused by the large ly@xmath0 contribution into the @xmath7-band flux .",
    "we have shown that the nb921-depression is a powerful search method for strong laes .",
    "first , by this method one can search for high-@xmath14 laes with a large @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) in a larger redshift range , @xmath12 , than the traditional nb921-excess method ( @xmath104 ) .",

    "second , this method picks up laes with a very large @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) selectively .",
    "the laes with a large @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) are highly interesting because a very young stellar population or a top - heavy initial - mass function would be expected for laes with @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) @xmath105 ( e.g. , leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ; malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) . and more interestingly",
    ", a population iii stellar cluster is also expected to show very large @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) because it radiates much more hydrogen - ionizing photons per unit mass than population i / ii stellar clusters ( e.g. , schaerer 2002 , 2003 ; venkatesan , tumlinson , & shull 2003 ; scannapieco , schneider , & ferrara 2003 ) . to pursue these interesting high-@xmath14 populations ,",
    "the nb921-depression method is a highly efficient strategy ( see also nagao et al .",
    "2005b ) and thus the application of this method to other deep fields will be an excellent way to investigate high-@xmath14 populations further .",
    "our interest in laes with a large @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) naturally leads to the following question : does the frequency distribution of @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) evolve on a cosmological timescale ? at @xmath15 , @xmath1011% of lbgs ( i.e. , broadband - selected objects ) show @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) @xmath105 ( sharpley et al . 2003 ) . on the contrary , at @xmath11 ,",

    "@xmath105 as discussed above , our results suggest that the frequency distribution of @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) evolves significantly from @xmath11 to @xmath15 , which may imply the evolution of some properties of stellar populations such as the mean stellar age or the initial mass function ( see , e.g. , kudritzki et al . 2000 ; malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) .",
    "note that some difference in the @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) frequency distribution is caused by a selection effect , because lbgs at @xmath15 are selected by two colors while @xmath3-dropout galaxies at @xmath11 are selected by a @xmath22 color alone .",

    "1999 ) , the sdf @xmath3-dropout sample consists of galaxies with @xmath108 mag which corresponds to @xmath109 if adopting the uv luminosity function at @xmath10 reported by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . while the above discussion on the evolution of the @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) frequency distribution would not be affected if emission - line equivalent widths are independent of luminosity of galaxies as suggested by , e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , other observations imply that the emission - line equivalent widths may depend on the luminosity of galaxies ( e.g. , ando et al .",
    "we do not discuss this issue further because this topic is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we now consider the star - formation rates ( sfrs ) of the nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout galaxies .",
    "the sfrs of the two nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout galaxies are obtained by adopting the following relation ; @xmath110(ly@xmath0 ) = @xmath111 @xmath112(ly@xmath0 ) @xmath113 yr@xmath42 where @xmath112(ly@xmath0 ) is in units of ergs s@xmath42 ( kennicutt1998 ; brocklehurst 1971 ) . then @xmath110(ly@xmath0 )",

    "these sfrs are lower limits because no corrections are made for possible absorption effects on the ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "we can also estimate the sfrs from the luminosity of the uv stellar continuum by adopting the following relation ; @xmath114 ( kennicutt 1998 ) . by using the uv continuum flux densities measured from the @xmath5 magnitudes , we obtain @xmath115 9.9 @xmath113 yr@xmath42 and @xmath115 4.8 @xmath113 yr@xmath42 for sdf j132426.5 + 271600 and sdf j132442.5 + 272423 , respectively . here",
    "the salpeter initial mass function ( 0.1100 @xmath113 ) and the flat uv sed are assumed to derive @xmath110(ly@xmath0 ) and @xmath116 ( see kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the ratios of sfrs estimated by the two methods , @xmath110(ly@xmath0)/@xmath116 , are significantly higher than unity in both of the two observed objects , which is similar to the other nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout galaxy reported by nagao et al .",
    "this result is interesting because high-@xmath14 laes with smaller @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) tend to show the opposite trend ( i.e. , @xmath110(ly@xmath0)/@xmath116 @xmath117 1 ; e.g. , hu et al .",
    "2002 ; ajiki et al .",
    "2003 ; taniguchi et al .",
    "2005 ) , possibly due to resonance scattering effects on the ly@xmath0 emission . as mentioned by nagao et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , this systematic difference in the ratio of @xmath110(ly@xmath0)/@xmath116 between laes with small @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) and large @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) may be due to a different stellar population because large @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) is difficult to reproduce by continuous star formation with a normal initial mass function , which is assumed when we derive the sfrs .",
    "this trend is consistent with the description of schaerer ( 2000 ) in which @xmath116 is underestimated for star - forming galaxies with an age of @xmath120 yr ( see also , e.g. , leitherer et al . 1999 ; malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) .",
    "based on deimos follow - up spectroscopy of objects imaged in the sdf , we identified two nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout objects to be strong laes at @xmath10 . taking both this finding and theoretical considerations into account , we conclude that most of the nb921-depressed @xmath3-dropout objects in the sdf are strong laes at @xmath12 .",
    "the presence of a large fraction of laes with a large @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) may imply the evolution of @xmath32(ly@xmath0 ) at high redshift .",
