    "doping of crystals formed by large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules like picene has originated a new class of superconducting materials of very promising characteristics .",

    "fig : clusters ] ) . in this way",
    ", the original structure of pristine crystalline picene is minimally distorted .",
    "the relevant electronic bands are above the original semiconducting gap of undoped picene .",

    "we suggest that this capability of the last doping electron for visiting both the pah molecule and the doping site should be the ultimate reason for the metallic behavior of the compound .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to give some details of the methods and procedures used in this work .",

    "it allows recovering the main results obtained for small clusters . besides",
    ", solutions for larger systems give further support to our explanation of metallic charge transport .",
    "the work ends with a few final concluding remarks ( section v ) .",
    "potassium - doped picene clusters have been constructed based on the probable crystalline structure of k@xmath0picene@xcite .",
    "the edge - to - face arrangement of picene molecules is similar to the one found in pristine picene while the positions of k atoms are not precisely known although all studies agree in having intralayer potassium that is more or less regularly distributed between aromatic molecules . in our study",
    ", we choose the most regular possible environments for picene molecules always surrounding them by twelve k atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : clusters ] ) . the price we pay for this choice is a system that is too rich in potassium according to nominal stoichiometry . nevertheless , we have found a procedure that works fine and correctly simulates the electronic structure of k@xmath0picene .",
    "firstly , the neutral cluster is fully optimized at a density functional theory ( dft ) level . secondly",
    ", the number of electrons in the cluster is reduced to make charge distribution as close as possible to the one corresponding to the bulk material . in this way ,",
    "three electrons are allowed to flow to picene molecules while the rest of k valence electrons are assumed to be transferred to more distant molecules ( that is , picene molecules that are not included in the cluster ) .",
    "actually , charge transference from @xmath1 k orbital to lumo and lumo+1 or lumo+2 of picene is a bit more subtle since the third electron is not completely transferred to picene molecules .",
    "that means that k keeps part of its valence electron . after some trial and error we have found that about one half of an electron remains in the groups formed by three almost aligned potassium atoms sitting between four picene molecules",
    "consequently , picene molecules gain only two and a half electrons and the total number of electrons of a cluster should be carefully modulated to be consistent with this situation . prior to present detailed results",
    ", we would like to motivate the reader showing precisely the charge distribution on k orbitals predicted by our approach not only for the relatively small clusters that can be studied with high numerical precision but also for larger clusters that have been studied at a lower demanding computational cost ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : super ] at the end of the quantum chemistry section ( iii ) ) .",
    "@xmath3{182a2-no - sinmezcla.jpg } & \\includegraphics[width=0.49\\columnwidth]{183b2-no - sinmezcla.jpg}\\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    in one case we have added chlorine atoms to the cluster to avoid changing the total number of electrons of the system after geometrical optimization .",
    "one electron is transferred from potassium atoms to each chlorine atom that is added to the cluster .",
    "therefore , a cl@xmath4k@xmath5picene@xmath6 cluster has six valence electrons ready to populate picene lumos .",
    "however , dft results show that two of these electrons remain on k atoms again demonstrating that the electron transfer from k to picene is not complete . following a similar reasoning",
    "as used above for binary clusters , a complete charge consistency would imply some reduction of the number of chlorine atoms .",
    "this implies further geometry optimization and still lower symmetry around picene molecules , that is , strong reasons for not insisting along this line .",
    "the electronic structure of clusters has been obtained using us gamess@xcite program that is a complete quantum chemistry package that allows both density functional theory ( dft ) calculations and precise configuration interaction ( ci ) multireference calculations . when performing mean - field calculations , exchange and correlation are approximately included by the b3lyp functional@xcite .",
    "this is an hybrid gga ( generalized gradient approximation ) functional combining five functionals , in particular , hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange . a large valence triple zeta plus polarization on all atoms ( 6 - 311 g * * ) gaussian basis has been chosen for h , c , and k atoms@xcite .",
    "all graphical results have been obtained using the wxmacmolplt package@xcite .",
    "this is the smallest k - picene system we have studied and the only one allowing state - of - the - art ci analysis .",
    "based on the results of this case , we suggest that multireference calculations can be partially mimic at the dft level increasing the spin multiplicity of the electronic state . in this way",
    "electrons can visit molecular orbitals that are not occupied in the singlet state .",
    "sometimes even the total electronic energy decreases with increasing spin multiplicity .",
    "we do not give any significance to this fact since most probably a ci analysis would change the conclusions about the correct spin of the ground state .    to learn about the effect of k intercalation in picene crystal ,",
    "one picene molecule is surrounded by twelve k atoms as it happens in the crystalline structure .",
    "the positions of k atoms are forced to conserve the original c@xmath7 symmetry of the isolated polycyclic aromatic molecule just to make easier both computation and analysis .",
    "the precise geometry is obtained by minimization of the b3lyp total energy of the neutral cluster ( the resulting cluster is represented in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : clusters ] ) .",
    "the final geometry does not differ appreciably from the crystalline one@xcite .",
    "in fact , the mean distance of potassium atoms to the plane of the picene molecule is 2.91  , being deviations from this value less than 0.3  .",
    "similar values hold for the other clusters shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clusters]@xcite . after geometry optimization of the neutral cluster",
    ", nine electrons are removed from the cluster limiting to three the maximum number of electrons that potassium can transfer to the picene molecule . as has been said before , electrons removed from the cluster belong to neighboring cells that are not explicitly included in the study .",
    "geometry is hold fixed as a further optimization would artificially increase k - picene distances .",
    "our b3lyp calculations for the k@xmath4picene@xmath8 cation indicate that while two electrons occupy the lumo of isolated picene molecule , the third one remains in a symmetric combination of @xmath1 k orbitals ( more precisely , the bonding combination of all twelve @xmath1 orbitals with almost equal coefficients that is shown in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : k12picenebis ] for the somewhat less charged k@xmath4picene@xmath9 cation )",
    ". nevertheless , picene lumo+1 and lumo+2 are close in energy suggesting that they will play an important role if the one - configuration limitation is avoided .",
    "in fact , some tweaking of minor computational details like geometry optimization or not of the ion , or keeping or not the symmetry group shows that the third valence electron can either occupy k orbitals or flow to some combination of picene lumo+1 and lumo+2 .",
    "consequently , a robust description of the electronic state requires at least a two - configuration wavefunction participated by both k and picene orbitals . here , dft analysis was followed by a precise mcscf ( multi - configurational self consistent field ) wavefunction study in which sixteen orbitals describing the three valence electrons@xcite were allowed to mix .",
    "that means 468 ( 480 ) determinants having space symmetry a@xmath10 ( b@xmath6 ) for @xmath11 .",
    "next , we will discuss the results obtained for the more interesting b@xmath6 symmetry although the lowest energy obtained for this symmetry is somewhat higher ( 0.31 ev ) than the one obtained for the a@xmath10 wavefunction .",
    "we choose b@xmath6 solution for symmetry reasons since a@xmath10 k orbitals do not couple to @xmath12 electrons .",
    "the occupation of an a@xmath10 molecular orbital ( upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : k12picenebis ] ) would lead to a much larger charge on potassium atoms , i.e. , to an almost pure 4s k band showing half filling .",
    "may be this could provide an alternative explanation for metallic conductivity but we are strongly inclined to think that an ionic scenario showing partial charge transfers from k to picene is the most adequate .",

    "is a mixture of picene lumo+1 and lumo+2 ( both of b@xmath6 symmetry ) and @xmath1 potassium orbitals .",
    "it is symmetric relative to the above mentioned plane and its occupation is 0.992 .",
    "its hybrid character indicates that the third electron does not flow completely to picene orbitals but remains partially on k atoms . since good quality",
    "ci computation is not possible for larger clusters , we will explore now an easier way to partially recover these results .",
    "firstly , we argue that some additional electrons should be included in the cluster because our mcscf calculation proves that only about two and a half electrons are transferred to the picene molecule and , consequently , about one half electron remains on every group formed by three k atoms .",
    "therefore , the total count of valence electrons is @xmath13 in this case , that is , one and a half more electrons than considered in the previous multi - configurational analysis . as subsequent calculations at a dft level evidence , the addition of just one extra valence electron to the system suffices to end with a nearly consistent charge both on picene and k groups .",

    "we attribute the discrepancy to the different choice of density functional .",
    "nevertheless , these values are not disturbing both because the structure is still experimentally unknown and because our methodology correctly reproduces experimental values of the kch@xmath0 molecule ( 2.67  and 1.10  for kc and ch bonds and 107.6@xmath34 for hch angle compared to 2.63  , 1.13  and 107.0@xmath34 measured values ) . in any case",

    "let us count electrons starting from neutral picene molecules and completely ionized potassium atoms ( k@xmath35 ) .",
    "from here on , we will refer to the electrons in this initial electronic configuration as core electrons because their wavefunctions are very close to the ones corresponding to isolated molecules or ions .",
