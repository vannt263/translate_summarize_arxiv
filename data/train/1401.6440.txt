    "hexagonal boron nitride ( @xmath0-bn ) has a structure similar to that of graphite . the boron and nitrogen atoms within a single @xmath0-bn sheet form strong bonds on a hexagonal lattice , as in graphene , while the bonding between layers is weak , as in graphite .",
    "in contrast to graphene or graphite , @xmath0-bn is a large band gap insulator , making it a very suitable substrate and gate dielectric for applications in graphene electronics @xcite .",
    "indeed it has been shown that the mobility of the charge carriers in graphene adsorbed on @xmath0-bn at low temperatures is comparable to that measured in suspended graphene @xcite . at room temperature",
    "the electron mobility in suspended graphene is even an order of magnitude _ lower _ than in graphene on @xmath0-bn , because of scattering by thermal ripples @xcite ; the @xmath0-bn substrate is atomically flat @xcite and ripple formation is suppressed by clamping by the van der waals bonding between the @xmath0-bn substrate and the graphene layer .    like graphene",
    ", @xmath0-bn layers can be prepared by mechanical exfoliation @xcite .",
    "cleaved layers can be thinned to a single layer with a high - energy electron beam @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xmath0-bn layers can be grown by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) on transition metals such as cu or ni , using precursors such as borazine ( b@xmath2n@xmath2h@xmath3 ) or ammonia borane ( nh@xmath2-bh@xmath2 ) @xcite . with a proper choice of growth conditions ,",
    "homogeneous ultrathin @xmath0-bn layers can be grown 1 - 5 monolayers thick .",
    "graphene can be subsequently grown by cvd on top of @xmath0-bn @xcite or on top of a @xmath0-bn layer adsorbed on a metal substrate @xcite which is ideal for field - effect devices .",
    "hexagonal boron nitride ( @xmath0-bn ) is an insulating material , with a measured band gap of 5.97 ev @xcite that is indirect @xcite .",
    "the direct nature of the band gap in monolayer @xmath0-bn@xcite suggests it as an interesting candidate for making ultraviolet light emitting diodes and lasers , but the size of the band gap makes it difficult to form stable @xmath4-@xmath5 junctions or ohmic metal contacts .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath0-bn is a material with a negative electron affinity @xcite , which would make obtaining a low barrier contact for electrons extremely challenging . at the same time",
    "this would improve the chances for making low barrier contacts for holes . having low barrier metal contacts",
    "is advantageous for using @xmath0-bn as a semiconductor but disadvantageous for graphene devices where @xmath0-bn is used as an insulator .    in this paper",
    "we use density functional theory ( dft ) calculations to determine the hole schottky barrier height @xmath6 between a metal contact and @xmath0-bn for a series of metals whose work functions range from 4.2 to 6.0 ev .",
    "substantial schottky barrier heights ( @xmath7 ev ) are found in all cases .",
    "the relationship between the schottky barrier heights and the clean metal work functions is not simple .",
    "a key role is played by a potential step at the metal@xmath1-bn interface , which originates from an interface dipole layer that is formed when @xmath0-bn is adsorbed on a metal surface .",
    "this potential step effectively lowers the metal work function and increases the schottky barrier height for holes . for weak adsorption ( physisorption ) , we find that the size of the interface dipole can be described by a universal function that only depends on the metal@xmath1-bn bonding distance , and not on the metal .",
    "special attention is devoted to the case where the adsorption energies are weak and there is a lattice mismatch between @xmath0-bn and the metal surface . under these circumstances",
    ", we expect that a superstructure will be formed with a periodically modulated interface dipole and potential step that have the same periodicity as the superstructure .",
    "we use density functional theory ( dft ) to calculate ground state energies and optimized geometries with a projector augmented wave ( paw ) basis set @xcite as implemented in vasp @xcite .",
    "the interfaces are modeled using @xmath0-bn adsorbed on finite slabs of metal , six close - packed atomic layers thick .",
    "this bilayer structure is repeated periodically and separated from its images by a thick vacuum region .",
    "a dipole correction is applied to avoid spurious interactions between the periodic images @xcite .",
    "the plane wave kinetic energy cutoff is set at 400 ev .",
    "we apply a @xmath8 * k*-point grid to sample @xmath9 and @xmath10 surface brillouin zones ( bz ) and use the tetrahedron scheme for bz integrations @xcite .",
    "the electronic self - consistency criterion is set to @xmath11 ev .",
    "interface geometries are relaxed until the total energy is converged to within @xmath12 ev .",
    "the boron and nitrogen atoms in the _",
    "h_-bn slab , and the top two atomic layers of the metal surface are allowed to relax during the geometry optimization .",
    "the other four metal layers are kept fixed in their crystal structure . for the @xmath13 ti surface supercell",
    "we use a @xmath14 * k*-point grid during geometry relaxation and a @xmath15 grid to converge the charge density of the optimized geometry .    the interaction in",
    "weakly ( van der waals ) bonded systems is difficult to describe within dft .",
    "commonly used generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) functionals , such as pw91 or pbe , incorrectly predict essentially no bonding between @xmath0-bn or graphene layers @xcite , as well as no bonding between @xmath0-bn or graphene and transition metal ( 111 ) surfaces @xcite .",
    "the local density approximation ( lda ) is empirically found to give a reasonable description of the bonding ( geometry and energy ) between @xmath0-bn layers,@xcite between @xmath0-bn or graphene and metal ( 111 ) surfaces and between a @xmath0-bn and a graphene layer @xcite .",
    "moreover , very accurate ac - fdt - rpa ( adiabatic - connection fluctuation - dissipation theory in the random phase approximation ) binding energy calculations for graphene on @xmath0-bn by sachs _ _ et al.__@xcite are in good agreement with the lda.@xcite in general , however , the lda is known to overestimate chemical bonding , and it does not capture van der waals interactions properly .    in this paper",
    "we use one of the recently developed and implemented van der waals density functionals ( vdw - df ) @xcite , and compare the results to those obtained with lda . in the vdw - df , the exchange - corrrelation functional is split up as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 describes non - local electron - electron correlations and @xmath18 local correlations . for @xmath17 and @xmath18 we use the vdw kernel developed by dion _ et al .",

    "for the systems we will be studying , it is not clear whether the lda or the vdw - df gives a better description of reality .",

    "[ tappendix ]    though the calculated work function of pt and the @xmath0-bn ionization potential are very close ( @xmath28 ev ) , the calculated schottky barrier is @xmath29 ev .",
    "this is caused by a potential step @xmath30 of that size , which is formed upon adsorption of @xmath0-bn on pt , which effectively lowers the pt work function .",
    "such potential steps are formed when @xmath0-bn is adsorbed on all of the metal substrates studied in this paper , which implies that all schottky barrier heights @xmath31 ev . the schottky barrier heights for electrons are even higher , i.e. , @xmath32 ev .",
    "this means that it will not be easy to apply @xmath0-bn as a semiconductor material .",
    "it also means , however , that @xmath0-bn is a good insulator for use in graphene electronics .",
    "we argued in sec .",
    "[ ssec : mbinding ] that a metal - bn interface is very likely to be incommensurable if @xmath0-bn is physisorbed and the metal - bn lattice mismatch is substantial .",
    "when forced to use commensurable structures in electronic structure calculations to model incommensurable systems , care must be taken to ensure that this does not alter the electronic structure unacceptably . modifying the in - plane lattice constant of a close - packed metal surface by a few percent only affects its electronic properties mildly .",
    "for instance , the work function typically changes on the scale of 0.1 ev , the binding energy of a physisorbed species on the scale of 0.01 ev / atom .",
    "by contrast , changing the lattice parameter of graphene by a few percent can change the way it binds to a metal substrate qualitatively .",
    "for example , stretching graphene by 4% to match the cu(111 ) lattice leads to an unrealistically strong chemisorption of graphene , decreasing the binding distance to the cu surface from 3.3  @xcite to 2.2  .    for these reasons we chose in sec .",
    "[ ssec : mbinding ] to fix the lattice parameter of @xmath0-bn at its equilibrium value and adapt the metal in - plane lattice constants accordingly .",
    "the adjustments are largest for pt(111 ) and pd(111 ) , whose lattices have to be stretched by 3.5% and 4.6% , respectively , if a @xmath22 metal surface cell is matched to a @xmath33 @xmath0-bn cell . table [ tappendix ]",
    "gives the results for the case where we fixed the in - plane lattice constants of pt(111 ) and pd(111 ) to the experimental values , and compressed the @xmath0-bn lattice accordingly .",
    "a comparison with the numbers given in table [ tbeq ] shows that for this case the differences are moderate .",
    "the lda work functions of the clean pt and pd(111 ) surfaces differed there from experiment by  0.12 ev . adapting the @xmath0-bn lattice to the experimental metal lattice constants increases the adsorption energies by 0.057 ev / bn for pd and by 0.018 ev / bn for pt .",
    "the interface potential step decreases by 0.09 ev for pt , and increases by 0.04 ev for pd .",
    "these differences are similar or smaller than the uncertainties caused by using different functionals .",
