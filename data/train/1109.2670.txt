    "the latter is a homogeneous electron gas with the same density at the impurity as anywhere else . for small @xmath23",
    "the magnetic d - electron causes only a relatively small change for small @xmath0  since the kondo ground state has not yet developed .",
    "when @xmath0 becomes larger than @xmath160 the kondo ground state has formed and causes a phase shift of @xmath169 for all electrons with smaller energy .",
    "this phase shift is the reason why the scalar product with the free electron case ( @xmath168 ) goes to zero , i.e. @xmath69 diverges .",
    "it is analogous to the anderson orthogonality catastrophe .",
    "the difference between the kondo and the symmetric fa impurity is that we do nt compare the latter with the free electron case but with a state that has the same s - d - potential @xmath104 .",
    "if one chooses for the nullstate the symmetric friedel impurity then all electrons within the resonance width already have a phase shift of @xmath169 in the nullstate .",
    "on the other hand in the singlet ground state of the fa impurity all electrons with energy smaller the @xmath151 also have a phase shift of @xmath169 . since this is the same phase shift as in the nullstate it does not reduce the scalar product of the fidelity between the nullstate and the singlet ground state with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the fidelity becomes asymptotically constant .",
    "finally it is tempting to compare the ground - state wave function of a kondo impurity with that of a fa impurity . from tables",
    "i and ii one finds that the kondo impurity with @xmath170 and the fa impurity with @xmath171 , @xmath99 and @xmath103 have roughly the same singlet - triplet excitation energy ( @xmath172 versus @xmath173 ) .",
    "therefore we calculate the scalar product which yields the similarity between the wave functions for different @xmath0 .",
    "this similarity ( which is defined in the literature as fidelity ) is plotted in fig.9 .",
    "it shows that @xmath68 is close to 1.0 and approaches a constant value of @xmath87 for large @xmath0 .",

    "this corresponds to a level separation at the fermi energy of @xmath177 .",
    "this is of the order of the singlet - triplet excitation energy of the two systems .",
    "in this paper the ground states of the kondo impurity and the friedel - anderson impurity are calculated for many parameters and seven different numbers @xmath0 of wilson states using the fair theory .",
    "the effective number of band electrons is @xmath178 . for each number of wilson states the resulting ground states  ( which we denote as fidelity states )",
    "are compared with the corresponding ground states for zero interaction , the so - called nullstates .",
    "the fidelity is obtained by forming the scalar product between the fidelity state and the nullstate for each @xmath0 .",
    "then the logarithm of the fidelity @xmath69 is plotted versus @xmath179 .",
    "the fidelity shows very different behavior for the kondo and the friedel - anderson impurities . in the symmetric fa impurity it saturates at large values of @xmath0 while for the kondo impurity",
    "the logarithm @xmath71 diverges .",
    "this result demonstrates that the behavior of the fidelity depends as much on the choice of the simple nullstate as on the interacting fidelity state .    for the symmetric fa impurity",
    "we choose a nullstate with @xmath102 and @xmath101 ( to maintain the symmetry ) but leave @xmath104 constant . here",
    "the s - electrons close to the fermi energy already have a phase shift of @xmath169 in the nullstate .",
    "the interacting ground state introduces a phase shift of @xmath169 as well in a narrow energy range about the fermi energy .",
    "therefore if one increases the number of states closer and closer to the fermi level the phase shift in the nullstate and the fidelity state are the same and the scalar product does not change .",
    "on the other hand , for the kondo impurity we set @xmath168 and obtain a nullstate whose conduction band is the free electron band that has no phase shift , and the fidelity decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "it is not sufficient to turn off the interaction in the nullstate .",
    "one also has to know or investigate the phase shift of its s - electrons close to the fermi level .",
    "in this respect the fidelity calculations yield comparative information about the s - electrons at the fermi level .",
    "in addition a change in the slope of @xmath69 versus @xmath0 indicates at which energy the inner structure changes , either of the nullstate or the fidelity state .",
    "if we compare two multi - electron states then the behavior of the fidelity does not tell us whether none , one or both are interacting electron systems .",
    "the fidelity does not correlate with the many - body physics of the problems .",
    "finally , we observed that the fidelity of ground states of the kondo and the fa hamiltonians with similar kondo temperatures does not show an anderson orthogonality catastrophe , but on the contrary is relatively close to one and becomes constant with an increasing number of wilson states @xmath180",
    "wilson considered an s - band with a constant density of states and the fermi energy in the center of the band . by measuring the energy from the fermi level and dividing all energies by the fermi energy wilson",
    "obtained a band ranging from @xmath120 to @xmath181 . to treat the electrons close to the fermi level at @xmath182 as accurately as possible he divided the energy interval @xmath183 geometrically at energies of @xmath184 . in most cases the value @xmath185 is used yielding @xmath186 .",
    "i.e. @xmath187 . this yields energy cells @xmath188 with the range @xmath189 width @xmath190 @xmath191 @xmath192 and average energy @xmath193 .",
    "wilson rearranged the quasi - continuous original electron states @xmath194 in such a way that only one state within each cell @xmath195had a finite interaction with the impurity . assuming that the interaction of the original electron states @xmath196 with the impurity is independent of @xmath197 , this interacting state in @xmath188 had the form@xmath198 where @xmath199 is the total number of states @xmath200 in the cell @xmath188 ( @xmath201 @xmath202 is the total number of states in the band ) .",
    "there are @xmath203 additional linear combinations of the states @xmath204 in the cell @xmath188 but they have zero interaction with the impurity and were ignored by wilson as they are within this paper .",
    "the interaction strength of the original basis states @xmath196 with the d - impurity is assumed to be a constant , @xmath205 .",
    "then the interaction between the d - state and the wilson states @xmath206 is given by @xmath207 where @xmath208 @xmath209 @xmath210      let us first consider the friedel impurity without spin .",
    "its hamiltonian is @xmath211 we call this hamiltonian sub - diagonal because it is diagonal in the states @xmath212 but not between @xmath212  and @xmath63 .",

    "finds the exact eigenstates @xmath216 and a diagonal hamiltonian .",
    "the ground state with @xmath217 electrons is given by @xmath218 where @xmath215 is the vacuum state .",
    "of course , one can reverse the process and starting from the diagonal hamiltonian @xmath219 extract the resonance state @xmath63 and build an arbitrary orthonormal basis out of the @xmath220 which is orthogonal to @xmath63",
    ". the hamiltonian will not be diagonal in this basis .",
    "so in the final step one sub - diagonalizes the hamiltonian excluding the state @xmath63 in the process .    this reverse process can also be applied to the s - electron part of @xmath221 .",
    "one can build an arbitrary state @xmath222 . in the next step one",
    "builds a new orthonormal conduction band basis @xmath223 with @xmath224 states which are also orthogonal to @xmath37 .",
    "again the hamiltonian @xmath225 will not be diagonal and in the final step one sub - diagonalizes the hamiltonian excluding the state @xmath37 in the process .",
    "now @xmath37 is an artificial friedel resonance , i.e. the fair state .",
    "the state @xmath37 determines the composition of the whole basis @xmath152 .",
    "this fair concept is rather flexible because @xmath37 can be any combination of the s - states @xmath212 .",
    "it turns out that there is one special state @xmath37 with which one can construct the exact ground state of the friedel resonance . with this special fair state",
    "the friedel ground state takes the form@xmath226    this ground state of the friedel resonance has the great advantage that @xmath63 is only hybridized with one single s - electron @xmath37 . the fair state @xmath37 is in a way representing all other s - electrons .",
    "@xmath227 forms a composed state which shifts the energy of all the other electron states ( introducing a phase shift ) .",
    "it is the building block for the compact ground state of the fa and the kondo impurity .",
    "the wilson states are defined by the ratio @xmath228 . however , for some physical properties this sub - division of the energy band is too coarse .",
    "we observed an error in the amplitude of the friedel oscillation of about 10% for @xmath185 which became of the order of 1% for when the intervals where sub - divided twice ( corresponding to @xmath229{2}$ ] @xcite .",
    "therefore we checked whether the coarse sub - division of the band caused any error for the fidelity calculation .",
    "for this purpose we calculated the fidelity between two friedel resonances with two different d - energies , @xmath230 and @xmath231 . in both cases",
    "the s - d - coupling is @xmath108 . in fig.10",
    "the squares give the plot of @xmath69 versus the number of wilson states for @xmath185 , which is equivalent to all the plots in this paper .",
    "then we subdivided each cell into two equal subcells ( full circles ) and again each subcell into two new subcells ( full triangles ) . the number of states increased each time by a factor two but we plotted the newly calculated @xmath69 as a function of the original number @xmath0 of wilson states .",
    "first we observe that the resulting straight lines are perfectly parallel .",
    "secondly the two sub - divisions into equal subcells reduced the smallest energy @xmath154 at the fermi level by a factor of @xmath232 .",
    "this means that after two subdivisions the smallest @xmath154 for @xmath0 wilson states is equal to the original @xmath154 for @xmath233 wilson states .",
    "for example , the plot shows that the square at @xmath234 has the same value as the triangle at @xmath116 . if one would plot @xmath69 versus @xmath235 all points would fall on one straight line ( the one with the squares ) , although the number of states used in the calculation are varied by a factor four .",
    "this demonstrates that the fidelity depends essentially on the smallest energy @xmath154 at the fermi energy and not on the total number of states .",
