    "<S> we investigate the instabilities of low winding number electroweak strings using standard numerical techniques of linear algebra . for strings of unit winding </S>",

    "<S> we map the unstable regions for the various decay modes .     </S>",
    "<S> _ school of mathematical and physical sciences + university of sussex + brighton bn1 9qh + uk _    it has been known for some time that certain field theory models with spontaneous symmetry breaking contain toplogical defects , such as domain walls , strings and monpoles . </S>",
    "<S> these defects are stable because their field configurations wrap around the vacuum manifold , and to unwind them requires lifting the higgs field to its vacuum value in the unbroken phase , throughout an infinite volume of space . </S>",
    "<S> there is therefore an infinite energy barrier separating these defect solutions from the vacuum .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , defect solutions have been found in theories where they are not topologically stable . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions may be a maximum or a local minimum of the energy , depending upon the dynamics of the model in question . such ` </S>",
    "<S> embedded defects ' have been found in the electroweak model : @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this contains two embedded @xmath2 symmetry breakings which can both give rise to nielsen - olesen vortex solutions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions are called @xmath3- and @xmath4-strings depending upon how one chooses the embedding . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3-strings are expected to be unstable for all values of the parameters and so we will only consider @xmath4-strings .    </S>",
    "<S> the stability of @xmath4-strings for a range of parameters was addressed in james _ et al _ @xcite where it was shown that for physical values of the parameters the @xmath5 string is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the stability analysis did not extend down to small values of the higgs self coupling because of numerical problems caused by the widely different scales of the two cores of the string . </S>",
    "<S> the method adopted for fixing the gauge , locating the unstable mode and computing the eigenvalues was not wholly transparent either .    in perkins @xcite and achcarro </S>",
    "<S> _ et al _ @xcite instabilities due to @xmath6-condensation were investigated , and in achccaro _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ it was shown that a @xmath6-condensed string of winding number @xmath7 was equivalent to a string of winding number @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this decay mode achccaro _ et al _ also showed that there is another distinct physical decay mode for large @xmath7 strings , where the upper component of the higgs field acquires a non - zero value at the string core . </S>",
    "<S> this decay mode should result in the complete unwinding of the string .    </S>",
    "<S> macdowell and trnkvist showed that for some , unspecified , regions of the parameter space a string of winding number @xmath7 is unstable to the formation of @xmath6-fields with angular momentum @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we seek to complete the stability line of james _ et al _ , investigate the two decay modes of achcarro _ et al _ and investigate the @xmath11 decay modes of macdowell and trnkvist . </S>",
    "<S> we are careful to fix the gauge at the outset , and we use more usual eigenvalue methods than were adopted in james _ et al_. we do not , however , follow achcarro _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ in tracking the full non - linear evolution of the fields .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the bosonic sector of the weinberg - salam model with the lagrangian @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 are the pauli spin matrices , @xmath15 are the @xmath16 gauge fields , @xmath17 are the @xmath18 gauge fields and @xmath19 is the higgs doublet . the @xmath20 symmetry of this lagrangian is broken to the @xmath21 symmetry of electromagnetism by the higgs field acquiring a vacuum expectation value @xmath22 . with the standard field basis @xmath23 the boson masses generated by the higgs mechanism are @xmath24 the weinberg angle @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 , and @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> .    consider time independent field configurations with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , then the energy functional is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 this is the same as for the abelian - higgs model and so there is a nielsen - olesen string configuration given by @xmath32 which extremises the energy . </S>",
    "<S> the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are identical to those found by nielsen and olesen @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a general perturbation to the solution of the form @xmath35 this gives corrections to the action @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the perturbation operator and @xmath38 the equations of motion for the perturbations @xmath39 , could in principle be coupled equations in twenty fields . for the string background </S>",
    "<S> however , they separate into four sets of coupled equations . </S>",
    "<S> the first two are of the form @xmath40 which , since the string solution is invariant under charge conjugation , are just charge conjugates , so we need only consider the first of these . </S>",
    "<S> the third is of the form @xmath41 which contains only the fields of the nielsen - olesen vortex , and was addressed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth equation is @xmath42 which is just the usual wave equation of electromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> the last two equations do not contain any modes which can decrease the winding number , and so we must look at the solutions of ( 1 ) above for decay modes . as mentioned in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> these equations contain linear derivative terms and gauge degrees of freedom , both of which can be removed by choosing the background gauge conditions @xmath43 which are imposed by adding the gauge fixing terms @xmath44 to the lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to separate out the linear time derivatives and to set up gauge - fixed eigenvalue equations , which for equation ( 1 ) above are @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and the gauge fixed perturbation operator is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 the @xmath50 and @xmath51 perturbations decouple because the background string solution is independent of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> the gauge condition used means that the gauge fixing terms must be accompanied by fadeev - popov ghost terms . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an accompanying eigenvalue equation for the ghost field @xmath54 @xmath55 this is the same equation as ( 7 ) and so @xmath54 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 all have the same eigenvalue spectra . of the total of 5 eigenmodes in ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8) , only three should be physical , corresponding to the three spin states of the massive @xmath6 boson . </S>",
    "<S> this is ensured by the ghosts canceling one linear combination of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and one of the eigenmodes of @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> it may seem that the gauge choice ( 2)-(5 ) introduces unnecesary complications and a difficulty in identifying the physical modes . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are looking for decay modes where @xmath57 and the eigenvalues of ( 8) are positive , so there is no difficulty in identifying the field configurations of the decay modes . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth pointing out that ( 2)-(5 ) results in a considerable simplication in the resulting eigenvalue equations ( as opposed to the temporal gauge for instance ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we expand the scalar and gauge fields in total angular momentum states . </S>",
    "<S> for the gauge fields they are @xmath58 the total angular momentum operator for the gauge fields is @xmath59 where @xmath60 with @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> so the suffices @xmath63 and @xmath64 identify gauge fields with spin up and spin down respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the background string solution in total angular momentum states is @xmath65 and the perturbations are @xmath66 with @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to rescale @xmath68 to give dimensionless variables . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues are now in units @xmath69 and the magnetic field strength is in units @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> substituting in the above gives the eigenvalue equations @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    </S>",
    "<S> if we resolve @xmath74 into real and imaginary parts , the complex eigenvalue problem seperates into two eigenvalue problems with explicitly real fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are given above . </S>",
    "<S> the profiles for the nielsen - olesen vortex were solved for with a relaxation method on the energy functional , and then substituted into the eigenvalue equations above . </S>",
    "<S> this eigenvalue problem was solved for a range of @xmath79 and @xmath80 with the boundary conditions @xmath81 as @xmath82 by the standard matrix packages incorporated into matlab .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath83 a linear discretisation of @xmath84 was used . for @xmath85 </S>",
    "<S> the scales of the higgs core and the gauge field core are too different to use this linear descretisation so we followed yaffe @xcite in using the convenient transformation @xmath86 this maps the line @xmath87 to @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> linear discretisation of @xmath89 results in more points in the core region and is better suited to studying very small and very large values of @xmath90 . with this map </S>",
    "<S> we were able to look at @xmath79 down to @xmath91 .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting stability lines are shown in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> all the lines for the various decay modes separate the region on the left hand side where the string is unstable , from the region on the right hand side where the string is stable with respect to a particular decay mode .    the two decay modes of achcarro _ et al _ correspond to @xmath92 and @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath94 mode @xmath95 acquires a non - zero value at the core of the string , and then there is nothing to stop the string from completely unwinding and decaying to the vacuum . for the @xmath96 mode @xmath97 acquires a non - zero value at the core of the string , where its magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field of the string . </S>",
    "<S> the term giving rise to this @xmath6-condensation is @xmath98 , which is of the generic form @xmath99 for the interaction between a magnetic moment @xmath100 and a magnetic field @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> this term comes from the non - abelian nature of the field tensor . </S>",
    "<S> achcarro _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ showed that a @xmath6-condensed string of winding number @xmath7 has the same energy as a string of winding @xmath8 , and so the @xmath96 mode corresponds to a unit unwinding . </S>",
    "<S> it is this @xmath102 mode which is refered to as @xmath6-condensation in @xcite and @xcite . in the background gauge , however , far from the string @xmath95 can readily be indentified as the longitudinal @xmath6 gauge field , and so all the modes we have found can be called @xmath6-condensation .    for the @xmath5 string the relation @xmath67 </S>",
    "<S> gives that the @xmath92 and @xmath102 modes are one and the same with both @xmath95 and @xmath97 acquring non - zero values at the core of the string . </S>",
    "<S> the upper part of the stability line in the figure agrees with that found by james _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. this is different from the stability line in @xcite ( @xmath103 ) which was found analytically by using fairly crude approximations for the string solution and for the profiles of the @xmath6-fields . </S>",
    "<S> a large part of this difference could be that the decay mode of the @xmath5 string has non - trivial field configurations for the @xmath6-fields and for @xmath95 as well , whereas the analysis in @xcite contained no @xmath95 field .    for the @xmath104 string as well as the two decay modes mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> there is a third decay mode for which @xmath105 , @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that this decay mode corresponds to the @xmath104 string decaying to a string of winding number @xmath107 . since the @xmath4-strings are non - topological and an @xmath107 string has the same energy as an @xmath5 string , such a decay is to be expected , albeit with a larger energy barrier than the decay to an @xmath5 string . </S>",
    "<S> this later point is consistent with the @xmath105 decay mode having a much larger region of stability in the parameter space than the decay mode to an @xmath5 string .    </S>",
    "<S> generalising this to strings of winding number @xmath7 , means that we would expect there to be @xmath11 decay modes corresponding to the string decaying to strings of winding number @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we would expect that the stability lines for these decays to be such that those for larger units of unwinding would have greater regions of stability , due to the increasing energy barrier for such decays .    </S>",
    "<S> the stability lines for the @xmath109 string , appear to be consistent with this interpretation ( as are those for @xmath5 and @xmath104 strings ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is also consistent with the result of macdowell and trnkvist that strings of winding number @xmath7 have regions in the parameter space for which they are unstable to the formation of @xmath6-fields with angular momentum @xmath9 such that @xmath110 .    </S>",
    "<S> for the strings we studied ( @xmath111 ) , all have a stability line close to the @xmath112 axis for the mode with @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> for all the strings this line is in approximately the same place ( @xmath114 ) and approaches the @xmath112 axis as the number of points in the lattice is increased . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that in the continuum limit this @xmath113 mode will have zero eigenvalue along the line @xmath115 , and the deviation of the line from this value for finite lattices ( 100 points ) is an indication of the error .    for the complex conjugate problem with the fields @xmath116 and @xmath117,the stability lines </S>",
    "<S> are of course the same . </S>",
    "<S> the ` @xmath6-condensation ' mode is where @xmath118 is non - zero at the core of the string , so the magnetic moment is still aligned with the magnetic field of the string .    </S>",
    "<S> it must be noted that all the modes involve non - trivial field configurations for @xmath95,@xmath119 and @xmath97 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider the large @xmath7 limit . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that the @xmath95 and @xmath6 perturbations drop to zero whilst inside the core , we need only consider the small @xmath84 behaviour of the string solution , which is @xmath120 , @xmath121 as @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is a constant . substituting this into the perturbation equation ( 9 ) gives @xmath124 so for large @xmath7 , the perturbations in @xmath95 and the @xmath6 fields decouple . </S>",
    "<S> considering terms up to @xmath125 it was shown in @xcite that the equation for @xmath95 for @xmath126 has a stability line given by @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> the figure seems to indicate that the @xmath92 line is approaching this limit but there is no stability region in the bottom left of the plot , which is not altogether suprising since @xmath109 is not large @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we present an explanation for the movement of the @xmath102 stabilitiy line towards the line @xmath128 for increasing winding number . </S>",
    "<S> consider the equation for @xmath97 with @xmath102 for large @xmath7 , with the assumption that the perturbation drops rapidly to zero within the core , so that we need keep terms only up to @xmath129 : @xmath130 this has a solution @xmath131 for which @xmath132 , and so large @xmath7 strings are unstable to ` @xmath6-condensation ' for all values of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the stability regions of the @xmath102 modes displayed in the figure .      </S>",
