    "because of its relative proximity and its favorable location on the near side of its parent molecular cloud , the orion nebula ( , ) has long been studied as the archetype of massive star formation .",
    "its infrared characteristics have been key to our understanding of the flow of energy and the role of dust in such a region .",
    "extended thermal emission from warm dust in the vicinity of the trapezium ob star cluster that powers the orion nebula was discovered at 11.6 and 20  by @xcite .",
    "more detailed observations of this `` ney - allen nebula '' were subsequently carried out between 8 and 13  by @xcite , who showed that the emission peaks on  ( , b0.5v ) and argued that the primary heating mechanism for the grains in this region is resonantly trapped lyman-@xmath1 radiation . using somewhat higher spatial resolution observations ( 3 )",
    ", @xcite observed the orion nebula at multiple wavelengths from 7.6 to 24.3  , and used the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) on representative sightlines to confirm an earlier claim by @xcite of the presence of a second , cooler , extended emission component .",
    "hayward showed that the cool component ( 110  k _ vs. _ 300  k for the warm component ) peaks to the west of , and concluded that it arises from the back wall of the region blister and is primarily heated by radiation from  ( , o4 - 6pv ) .",
    "an overview of the geometry of the orion nebula and the `` main ionization front '' ( mif ) is given by @xcite .",
    "recent high - resolution mid - ir observations of the orion nebula have revealed a wealth of new detail  @xcite .",
    "the warm dust component is resolved largely into limb - brightened dust arcs around proplyds , and the brightest dust arc  that around is either a consequence of that star being located close to the background cloud  @xcite or is a photoevaporated circumstellar disk  @xcite .",
    "the remaining , mostly cool dust emission emerges as a complex of streaks , gaps , arcs , and protostellar jets .    in this letter",
    "we report on a study of the orion nebula with the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) using the mid - ir facility camera forcast . in this study , we extend the relatively high - resolution view of the diffuse emission in this region to longer wavelengths than have previously been reported , and focus on the and the proplyds .",
    "our report also includes brief descriptions of emission from the infrared source  and the cluster of young stellar objects in omc1 south .",
    "results for the active star formation region surrounding the becklin - neugebauer source and the kleinmann - low nebula are reported separately in this issue  @xcite .",
    "the _ sofia _ observations of orion were performed on the nights of 30 november and 3 december 2010 using the forcast instrument  @xcite .",
    "forcast is a dual - array mid - infrared camera capable of taking images with two filters simultaneously .",
    "the short wavelength camera utilizes a 256@xmath2256 pixel si : as array optimized for 525  , while the long wavelength camera utilizes a 256@xmath2256 pixel si : sb array optimized for 25 - 40  @xcite .",
    "after correction for focal plane distortion , forcast effectively samples at 0.768@xmath3 per pixel , which yields an approximately 3.4@xmath4@xmath23.2@xmath4 instantaneous field - of - view .",
    "observations were obtained in the 6.6 , 7.7 , 19.7 , 31.5 , and 37.1  filters at an aircraft altitude of 43000 ft .",
    "the chopping secondary of _ sofia _ was driven at 2  hz , with a chop throw of 7@xmath4 .",
    "such large throws were necessary to assure that the sky reference beam was completely off the extended orion nebula complex and sampling `` empty '' sky areas for background subtraction .",
    "for the same reasons the telescope was nodded 10@xmath4 away from the orion nebula . with this setup",
    ", orion was sampled in only one of the four chop - nod beams , and therefore the final effective on - source exposure times for the observations were 150  s at 6.6 and 7.7  , 450  s at 19.7  , 300  s at 31.5  , and 420  s at 37.1  .    because all forcast data were taken in the dichroic mode",
    ", we were able to determine relative astrometry using images from the two wavelengths that were observed simultaneously .",
    "data were taken with the following filter pairs : 19.7  /37.1  , 19.7  /31.1  , 6.6  /37.1  , and 7.7  /37.1  .",
    "therefore the relative astrometry of all filters was determined precisely by bootstrapping from the 19.7  /37.1  pair .",
    "we estimate that the relative astrometry between filters is known to better than 0.5 pixels ( @xmath50.38@xmath3 ) .",
    "absolute astrometry for each image was fixed by assuming that the peak of the bn source at 19.7  is the same as the peak at 7  mm given by @xcite , r.a.(j2000)=05h35m14.119s , dec(j2000)=-05d22m22.785s .",
    "the forcast images were calibrated to a flux density per pixel using a standard instrument response derived from measurements of standard stars and solar system objects over several short science and basic science flights  @xcite . the color correction from a flat spectrum source to that of the orion sources",
    "is @xmath6 . the estimated @xmath7 uncertainty in the calibration due to variations in flat field , water vapor burden , and altitude is approximately @xmath8 .",
    "flux calibrated images for the 7.7 , 19.7 , and 37.1  data are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : image_77 ] , [ fig : image_19 ] , and [ fig : image_37 ] : the images at 6.6  suffered from poor image quality and are not shown .    our forcast images at 7.7  reveal a number of compact sources which are consistent with irac images of the orion nebula available from the spitzer legacy archive and coincide with a number of known objects in the region ( see fig .",

    "only  and  are visible at 19.7  , and no known compact sources are detected at 31.5 and 37.1  .",
    "source fluxes ( or upper limits ) measured from our forcast images at 19.7 , 31.5 , and 37.1  for  and  are included in the seds shown in figure  [ fig : seds ] .",
    "a temperature map of the region was generated from the 19.7 and 37.1  images using a least - squares procedure to fit the observed surface brightnesses in each pixel to the model @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the blackbody function .",
    "we have adopted the mathis extinction law for the wavelength dependence of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 is evaluated for 19.7  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] ) .",
    "the surface brightnesses at each wavelength were given equal weight .",
    "the model corresponds to the solution of the radiative transfer equation for emission / absorption of material along the line of sight .",
    "the median dust temperature throughout the central part of the nebula is @xmath1470k and the emission is optically thin .",
    "the is the warmest region in the nebula ( besides bn / kl ) , with a color temperature in excess of @xmath1490k ( see discussion in section  [ sect : neyallen ] ) .",
    "these temperatures are significantly colder than those reported by @xcite for both the warm ( @xmath15  k ) and cold ( @xmath16  k ) dust components .",
    "this is to be expected , however , since our study utilizes longer wavelengths than @xcite and hence is more sensitive to colder dust .",
    "the dominant feature of the trapezium region is the , which is bright in all the forcast filters except for 37  , where it is very difficult to distinguish from variations in the background emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : image_37 ] ) .",
    "the morphology of ney - allen is clearly wavelength - dependent in our forcast images : at 7.7  , it is an elongated source ( approximately 4  @xmath2 7 ) , offset by 2.2 arcsec from  ( see fig  [ fig : image_77 ] ) ; in the images at 19 and 31  , it is a crescent surrounding the position of  with the apex pointing roughly toward a pa of 220 .",
    "the crescent shape is also apparent at n and q bands  @xcite , and 11.7  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the diameter of the crescent increases with wavelength , from approximately 5.5  at 19  to 8.2  at 31  , suggesting a radial temperature gradient indicative of heating by the central source , . the same increase in size with wavelength ( exceeding the increase in psf size as a function of wavelength )",
    "is also evident in irac images of the trapezium available from the spitzer legacy archive .",
    "@xcite suggested that the ney - allen emission could be due to dust that was evaporated from a massive circumstellar disk associated with . @xcite",
    "argue against this interpretation citing lack of evidence for such a disk ( though it is possible that the disk is now completely dissipated ) .",
    "since the axis of symmetry of the ney - allen crescent aligns very closely with the direction of proper motion for  ( 217 ) , @xcite instead postulated that the ney - allen emission is due to dust swept up in the bow shock between the stellar wind of   a b0.5v star  @xcite  and the ambient nebular material .",
    "our sofia - forcast observations are consistent with this interpretation . because  is the only member of the trapezium to show such a compressed shell , then",
    ", if this scenario is correct , it is probably in a relatively high density portion of the overall nebula .",
    "this suggests that   is much closer to the background dense cloud than are the other members of the trapezium , and may even be plunging into the background pdr  @xcite .",
    "two of the compact sources detected in the 7.7  images ( and ) are known proplyds  externally illuminated , low - mass young stellar objects whose circumstellar disks are being photoablated by the strong euv and fuv radiation from  @xcite .  is also visible in the 19.7 and 31.5  images , but is indistinguishable from the nebular background at 37.1  . at 19.7  appears slightly elongated in the ne ",
    "sw direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : image_19 ] ) ; the same orientation as the wind - wind bow shock ( the stand - off shock between the proplyd evaporative flow and the stellar wind from ) that is seen in both hst [ o  iii ] and h@xmath1 images  @xcite and at 11.7  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that dust from the proplyd circumstellar disk is entrained in the evaporative flow and then `` piles up '' at the wind - wind shock where it is heated by the uv radiation from  and emits strongly in the mid - ir . both hst3 and  are detected in 3.6  cm radio continuum  @xcite ; only hst3 is detected in the coup x - ray survey  @xcite .",
    "we have combined our mid - ir flux measurements with irac fluxes  @xcite , and additional ground - based mid - ir measurements  @xcite to generate the mid - ir sed for  shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] .",
    "interpretation of this sed is difficult , however , for two reasons :    1 .",
    "is a known double  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , so mid - ir dust emission can arise from a circumstellar disk around either source and from the observed interaction zone between the two sources ; 2 .",
    "mid - ir emission from the wind - wind shock can not be spatially separated from the binary proplyd emission .",
    "models of externally illuminated disks constructed by @xcite show that the mid - ir emission from 10 to 40  is dominated by emission from the disk interior ( peaking at @xmath17  ) and emission from the superheated atmosphere ( peaking at @xmath18  ) .",
    "these models tend to peak around 30  60  , which is not observed for  ( the peak in the  sed appears to be around 20  ) , suggesting that the mid - ir emission is dominated by a combination of the superheated disk atmosphere(s ) of the two  components and the dust piled up in the wind bow shock",
    ".  also has a modest 10  silicate emission feature  @xcite , which is also a strong component of the superheated disk atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "roughly 30  north of the bn / kl region is the relatively isolated infrared source  @xcite .",
    "is thought to be an embedded , luminous young stellar object ( yso ) with a massive circumstellar disk  @xcite : the near- to mid - ir sed shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] is consistent with this interpretation .",
    "model seds of young stellar objects were fit to the sed of  using the online yso sed fitting tool  @xcite with best fit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] .",
    "the @xcite models assume a single central stellar source with different combinations of axisymmetric circumstellar disks , infalling flattened envelopes and outflow cavities .",
    "the fitting procedure interpolates the model fluxes to the apertures used in the measurements , scaling them to a given distance range of a source , which in this case is taken to be 416@xmath19  pc  @xcite , and the line - of - sight extinction @xmath20 .",
    "we adopted a range of @xmath20 from 2.0 to 10.0 , based on the omc1 extinction map  @xcite .",
    "while these models yield estimates of physical parameters which are highly degenerate in general , they are fairly good at estimating the total luminosity of sources , which is our primary interest .",
    "the best fit sed models for  have a total bolometric luminosity of 110 to 215  l@xmath21 , which is somewhat higher than the value found by @xcite , but agrees with their conclusion that  is the progenitor of an early - a ( or late - b ) zams star with @xmath22  34  m@xmath21 .",
    "the best fit models also indicate that the bulk of the emission longward of 10  is due to a large circumstellar envelope ( @xmath23  au ) , whereas the flux from 310  is primarily from a much smaller circumstellar disk ( @xmath24  au ) .",
    "this suggests that the spatially resolved 8.8 to 18.3  emission observed by @xcite and attributed to a large circumstellar disk , may in fact be the inner regions ( @xmath25  au ) of an envelope .",
    "in addition to we also detect three of the infrared sources in the omc1-s region ( , , ) , also thought to be ysos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : image_77 ] ) . at longer wavelengths , detection and flux measurement of the omc1-s sources is not clear due to confusion with variations in the background emission . limiting fluxes based on variations in the nebular background , however , suggest that 20  40  emission from the omc1-s sources may be significant .",
    "we compared the 19 , 31 , and 37  limiting fluxes to flux measurements from spitzer  @xcite and found that the seds from 4.5 through 31  are consistent with class  i or `` flat spectrum '' protostars , though it is not possible to rule out the possibility that they are highly - reddened class  ii sources .",
    "the bright 7.7  source sw of the bn / kl region coincides with , a shock - excited region thought to be associated with an outflow or jet from omc1-s  @xcite . in contrast , is very weak at 6.6  and not detected in the 19 , 31 , and 37  images at all , strongly suggesting that the 7.7   excess is due to pah emission .",
    "the diffuse emission observed in our forcast images is generally a combination of emission from dust in both the background mif and the region itself . the observed 19.7/37.1  color temperature values across the nebula ( fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] ) are consistent with cool dust in the background pdr .",
    "the structures apparent in our 19.7 and 37.1  images are consistent with higher - resolution ground - based q - band ( 20  ) observations obtained by @xcite .",
    "the filamentary structure sw of the trapezium coincides roughly with bright [ n  ii ] and h@xmath1  emission features  @xcite and also with 8.4 and 1.5 ghz radio continuum emission  @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the filaments in the mid - ir correspond to undulations or folds in the background pdr surface that cause limb - brightening and shadowing effects  similar to the orion bar but on a smaller scale .    the diffuse emission drops significantly in the omc1s region in all of our forcast images .",
    "the 19.7/37.1 color temperature drops significantly as well , indicating reduced uv heating in this region .",
    "we interpret this as a shadowing effect wherein the bright folds and undulations ne of omc1s correspond to dense material that blocks the uv radiation field from .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of omc1s as a cold , dense region of gas and dust embedded _ within _ the region  @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the formation of the embedded protostars in omc1s may have been triggered by advancing shock waves when the orion nebula was first forming .",
    "the 37.1  image presented here is the highest spatial resolution image of the orion nebula at this wavelength to date .",
    "there are a number of features in the 37.1  image that have no counterparts at shorter wavelengths .",
    "most prominent , is a @xmath560  arc of emission to the west of omc1s ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : image_37 ] ) .",
    "this feature is not evident in narrow - band emission  @xcite , but is present in the 1.5 ghz radio continuum  @xcite .",
    "the arc coincides with a region of low color temperature as well ( fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] ) .",
    "interpretation of this arc is unclear , but it seems plausible that it is heated internally by the embedded omc1s protostars .    most of the other structures observed at 37  coincide with bright regions of [ nii ] and h@xmath1  emission , seen both in natural  @xcite and extinction - corrected images  @xcite . in particular",
    ", there is a very bright extended source just nw of the trapezium ( also noted by @xcite in their low - resolution 30  image ) which corresponds to one of the brightest regions in the nebula in h@xmath1  and [ ] emission  @xcite .",
    "some of the diffuse structures at 37.1  are also coincident with fluctuations in the color temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] ) .",
    "these two phenomena suggest that these are all perturbations in the surface of the background pdr .",
    "one possible exception , however , is the emission wsw of , which coincides with roughly 5 known proplyds , including the prominent sources lv4 , 5 , and 6  @xcite .",
    "we suggest that this is emission from dust that is entrained in the photoablation flows off the circumstellar disks around these sources and then heated by the uv radiation field of .",
