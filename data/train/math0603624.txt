    "for a sequence @xmath3 in the unit disk @xmath4 and a space of holomorphic functions @xmath5 , the interpolation problem consists in describing the trace of @xmath6 on @xmath3 , i.e.  the set of restrictions @xmath7 regarded as a sequence space .",
    "this problem has been considered for many spaces and also for domains different from @xmath4 .    in this paper , which can be regarded as a continuation of the work in @xcite , we will focus on spaces included in the nevanlinna or the smirnov class , and in particular on hardy - like spaces .",
    "carleson described in 1958 the interpolating sequences for the hardy space of bounded analytic functions on the unit disk by the condition that is now called the carleson condition @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this condition still charactizes interpolating sequences in a much broader situation .",
    "it was successively proved to be the right condition in @xmath0 , @xmath8 @xcite , in @xmath0 , @xmath9 @xcite , and for hardy - orlicz spaces @xmath10 contained in the scale @xmath0 , @xmath1 , in @xcite ( even for the weaker notion of _ free _ interpolation , see the definition below ) .",
    "a natural question is then to ask what happens beyond @xmath11 ?",
    "it is here where we enter into the territory of `` big '' hardy - orlicz spaces .",
    "two observations should be made at this junction .",
    "first , it is known on the one hand that the union of all hardy - orlicz spaces corresponds to the smirnov class ( see @xcite ) , and so especially the union of big hardy - orlicz spaces . on the other hand , interpolating sequences for the smirnov class ( and the nevanlinna class ) have been characterized recently in the paper @xcite .",
    "so , one could try to examine interpolating sequences for big hardy - orlicz spaces in the light of these results . since the characterization for the smirnov and nevanlinna classes is no longer given by the carleson condition this leads to the still open question where exactly the carleson condition ceases to be valid",
    "( see also the question at the end of this section ) .",
    "the second observation concerns the notion of interpolating sequences itself . when one wants to characterize for exemple interpolating sequences for the smirnov or the nevanlinna class , which kind of natural trace space can one hope for a priori ?",
    "the problem had been studied in the past for a priori fixed trace spaces ( see @xcite for the nevanlinna class and @xcite for the smirnov class ) , but those traces turned out to be too big ( naftalevi s case ) or too small ( yanagihara s case ) , see @xcite for more detailed comments on this .",
    "the notion that finally appeared to be natural is that of _ free _ interpolating sequences .",
    "this notion goes back to work by vinogradov and havin in the middle of the seventies and has been used for general interpolation problems by nikolski and vasyunin for hilbert spaces ( it works also in certain banach spaces ) .",
    "it has been succesfully used in @xcite for the smirnov class and the nevanlinna class ( the latter being even not a topological vector space ) .",
    "let us introduce the notion of free interpolation that we will use in this paper .",
    "[ ideal ] a sequence space @xmath12 is called _ ideal _ if @xmath13 , i.e.  whenever @xmath14 and @xmath15 , then also @xmath16 .    [ freeint ]",

    "[ l - infinit ] for any function algebra @xmath6 containing the constants , @xmath20  or equivalently @xmath21 is ideal  if and only if x.    this remark is quite easy to check and a proof is given in @xcite . let us repeat this proof here for completeness .",
    "the inclusion is obviously necessary . in order to see that it is sufficient notice that , by assumption , for any @xmath22 there exists @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "thus , if @xmath25 , then the sequence of values @xmath26 can be interpolated by @xmath27 .",
    "an almost trivial but nevertheless useful remark in our context is that if @xmath19 ( i.e.  @xmath21 is ideal ) then @xmath28 ( i.e.  @xmath29 is ideal ) for any subsequence @xmath30 .    in the case of the nevanlinna and smirnov classes the characterization of free interpolating sequences",
    "is given in terms of the existence of ( quasi - bounded ) harmonic majorants of a certain density associated with the sequence @xmath3 .",
    "this density is expressed in terms of blaschke products .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath31 be the elementary blaschke factor ( or mbius transform ) .",
    "for a sequence @xmath3 satisfying the blaschke condition @xmath32  which will be assumed throughout this paper  we set @xmath33 for the corresponding blaschke product , and @xmath34 .",

    "the condition ( d ) may appear quite technical .",

( in view of discussions to come we observe that @xmath50 . )    in the light of the above theorem , and since the hardy - orlicz spaces we are interested in are in a sense close to the smirnov class , it seems natural to seek for a condition in the spirit of condition ( b ) in the theorem .",
    "the modification should involve a more precise hypothesis on the weight @xmath51 adapted to the defining function of the hardy - orlicz space that we will introduce below .",
    "we will also see that the dual condition ( d ) of the theorem  or rather  has a counterpart in the hardy - orlicz situation ( replacing @xmath52 by the dual of a suitable orlicz space ) .",

    "let @xmath68 be a strongly convex function satisfying ( i ) , ( ii ) and the @xmath69-condition : 2(t)(t+ ) , tt_1 , where @xmath70 is a suitable constant and @xmath71 .",

    "we shall occasionally call @xmath73 the constant associated with a sequence verifying the carleson condition ( such sequences are usually called @xmath74-interpolating sequences ) .    the conditions on @xmath68 in the theorem imply that there exist @xmath75 such that @xmath76 . in particular , the @xmath69-condition implies the inclusion @xmath77 for some @xmath1 .",
    "this @xmath69-condition has a strong topological impact on the spaces .",
    "in fact , it guarantees that metric bounded sets are also bounded in the topology of the space ( and so the usual functional analysis tools still apply in this situation ; see @xcite for more on this and for further references ) .",
    "it was not clear whether this was only a technical problem or if there existed a critical growth for @xmath68 ( below exponential growth @xmath78 corresponding to @xmath0 spaces ) giving a breakpoint in the behavior of interpolating sequences for @xmath10 .",

    "this condition obviously implies that @xmath10 is stable with respect to multiplication so that under this condition @xmath10 is an algebra .",

    "it is interesting to note the analogy between condition ( d ) of this theorem and which characterizes the interpolating sequences for the nevanlinna class .",

    "* theorem 4.14 ) ) . as in @xcite",
    "we will investigate the problem of existence of harmonic majorants in the general setting .",
    "more precisely we are interested in the question when a borel function defined on @xmath4 admits a harmonic majorant @xmath101 $ ] with @xmath102 .",
    "the answer to this problem is given by the following result which involves the so - called poisson balayage .",

    "* theorem 1.4 ) .",
    "note also that the corresponding condition ( b ) in that theorem does not give a quasi - bounded majorant but only a harmonic majorant , and a more subtle condition is needed to handle the case of quasi - bounded majorants ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.6 ) ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we shall add some more comments on orlicz and hardy - orlicz spaces .",
    "the sufficiency part of our main theorem has been given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 9.1 ) and we refer the reader to that paper for a proof .",
    "the general structure of the proof of the necessity goes along the lines of the necessary part for the smirnov class .",
    "however , the key result ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.2 ) does not work any longer in our context .",
    "note that it is precisely that proposition which shows that separated blaschke sequences are interpolating for the nevanlinna and smirnov classes .",
    "we will actually discuss in some details in section [ examples ] an example showing that such a result can not be expected in hardy - orlicz classes .",
    "the example shows that there are big hardy - orlicz spaces which are close to each other in a sense and for which there exist even separated blaschke sequences that are interpolating for one space but not for the other one .",
    "for this reason we need a new idea which will be discussed in section [ necessity ] .",
    "the key is to factorize the blaschke product @xmath109 into two factors that behave essentially in the same way as @xmath109 ( in a sense to be made precise ) .",
    "this will be achieved through a theorem by hoffman .",
    "the trace space characterization is quite immediate and will be discussed in section [ trace ] . concerning harmonic majorants",
    ", we will discuss this problem in section [ harmmaj ] .",
    "we have already insisted in the analogy between our theorem [ charharmmaj ] and theorems 1.4 and 1.6 in @xcite .",
    "the techniques that apply in our situation are more classical than those used in @xcite : we will use some duality arguments and a theorem by mazur - orlicz on positive linear functionals ( which is essentially the hahn - banach theorem ) .",
    "the equivalence of ( b ) and ( d ) of theorem [ cns ] then follows from theorem [ charharmmaj ] ( it suffices to consider positive measures @xmath103 supported on @xmath3 ) .    with our big hardy - orlicz spaces we narrow down the gap in the description of interpolating sequences from above : coming from the smirnov class where the harmonic majorant must have an absolutely continuous measure , and so with an integrable weight @xmath110",
    ", we obtain now that the weight has to be in @xmath96 ( and we can get in a way arbitrarily close to @xmath100 , see also section [ examples ] ) .",
    "now , we have already indicated that the @xmath64-condition implies a polynomial growth on @xmath68 .",
    "observe that for classical hardy spaces @xmath0  where the carleson condition characterizes the interpolating sequences  the defining functions are given by @xmath111 .",
    "so one could ask what happens for defining functions with subexponential growth like e.g.  @xmath112 and whether there are hardy - orlicz spaces beyond @xmath0 , @xmath1 , for which the carleson condition still characterizes the interpolating sequences .",
    "for the background on the notions related to hardy - orlicz classes used in this section we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    let @xmath68 be a strongly convex function .",
    "one way of introducing the hardy - orlicz class @xmath10 is to take all the functions @xmath62 such that the subharmonic function @xmath113 admits a harmonic majorant on @xmath4 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 3.15 ) ) .",
    "we have already introduced the notation = keeping in mind that the function @xmath63 is chosen in a way guaranteeing that @xmath114 is subharmonic .    since @xmath36 is in the smirnov class ,",
    "the fact that @xmath114 has a harmonic majorant is equivalent to ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.18 ) ) j_(f)=_(|f(e^it)|)dt = _ ( |f(e^it)|)dt < , so that @xmath10 can be defined as = \\{fn^+:j_(f)=_(|f(e^it)|)dt<}. observe that @xmath10 does not depend on the behaviour of @xmath68 for @xmath115 whenever a @xmath116 is fixed .    the integral expression @xmath117 is called a modular , and it does not define a metric on @xmath10 . a metric can be defined by @xmath118 where [ metric ] f_=\\{t>0:j_(f",
    "/ t)t } , and @xmath10 equipped with this metric is a complete space .    in our situation , thanks to the @xmath64-condition , @xmath119 for any @xmath120 when @xmath121 so that we do not need to distinguish between the orlicz class , the orlicz space and the space of finite elements ( in the terminologie of @xcite ) .",

    "in other words @xmath132 is in the orlicz class @xmath96 of measurable functions @xmath97 such that @xmath133 .",
    "moreover @xmath134 , and @xmath135 ( recall that @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) , so that by standard results on orlicz spaces we get @xmath138 . in particular , if we now take any @xmath102 , then @xmath110 , and we can define an outer function in the smirnov class by f_w(z)= ( w()dm ( ) ) . for the same reasons as above this function has boundary limits @xmath129 a.e .",

    "indeed , the maximal radial growth that we can attain for @xmath139 is |f(z)|^(-1 ) ( ) .",
    "this can be deduced from the subharmonicity of @xmath114 and the change of variable @xmath140 ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ii.1.2 ) ) .",
    "hence [ pointeval ] |f(z)|^-1 ( ) . for classical hardy spaces @xmath0 one recovers from this the usual estimate on the point evaluation .",
    "we will use the above estimate to show that certain separate sequences are not interpolating for `` big '' hardy - orlicz classes ( see section [ examples ] ) .",
    "some more tools need to be introduced in the context of orlicz spaces . in the above arguments ,",
    "we did not need to appeal to topological considerations in @xmath96 .",
    "thus the definition of @xmath96 as the set of measurable functions @xmath51 for which @xmath141 was sufficient .",

    "we should pause here to add some comments on the proof of hoffman s theorem given in @xcite .",
