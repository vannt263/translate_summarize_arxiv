    "studying seismic vibrations of neutron stars is among the most promising tools in search for dynamical laws governing continuum mechanics and macroscopic electrodynamics of extremely dense matter compressed by self - gravity to the nearly normal nuclear density at which microscopic composition of stellar material is dominated by neutron component .",
    "one of the most conspicuous features distinguishing this subclass of final stage ( fs ) stars of evolutionary track from their massive main - sequence ( ms ) progenitors is that they come into existence as sources of ultra powerful magnetic fields ( chanmugam 1992 ) .",
    "it is hoped , therefore , that exploring vibrational behavior of spherical material masses capable of accommodating super strong magnetic fields we can gain some insight into the nature of the nuclear matter magnetism .    in this connection",
    "it is appropriate to emphasize that contrary to liquid ms stars whose magnetic fields are generated in dynamo processes by flows of perfectly conducting flowing matter ( energy supply of persistent convection in which comes from cental thermonuclear reactive zones ) , in the fs stars , white dwarfs and pulsars , there are no nuclear energy sources to support persistent convection ( e.g. flowers & ruderman 1977 , spruit 2008 ) .",
    "such point of view invalidates applicability to fs stars of magneto - fluid - mechanical arguments and methods in the analysis of magnetic field effects such , for instance , as anti - dynamo theorems . unlike the dynamo - generated fairly weak fields of liquid ms stars , the super strong and highly stable to spontaneous decay magnetic fields of isolated neutron stars ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 , van den heuvel 1994 , bhattacharya 2002 ) are regarded as fossil ( e.g. ferrario and wickramasinghe 2004 ) .",
    "these are thought of as frozen in the immobile , non - convective , degenerate stellar matter possessing properties of elastically deformable solid .",
    "it is believed , therefore , that basic features of asteroseimology of strongly magnetized end - products of stellar evolution ( white dwarf stars , neutron stars and still hypothetical quark stars ) can properly be understood working from equations of solid - mechanical theory of continuous media ( mcdermott et al 1988 , blaes et al 1989 , strohmayer 1991 , bastrukov 1996 , bastrukov et al 1999a , 1999b , franco et al 2000 , bastrukov et al 2007 see , also , references therein ) .",
    "many agree today that recent observations of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the outburst x - ray flux of two soft gamma - ray repeaters , sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 ( israel et al 2005 , watts & strohmayer 2006 ) have offered a real opportunity of using the detected qpo frequencies for asteroseismological inferences about internal structure , mechanical and magnetic properties of material of these ultra magnetized neutron stars whose x - ray bursting activity exhibits many features in common with earth quakes ( chen et al 1996 , woods & thompson 2006 , mereghetti 2008 ) .",
    "the detected qpos frequencies ( measured in hz ) , which are of particular interest for the subject of present work , are @xmath8 with all above in mind , in ( bastrukov et al 2007 - 2009 ) several models of post - quake vibrational relaxation of a solid star have been investigated .",
    "particular attention has been given to the regime of node - free or nodeless shear axisymmetric vibrations which remain less investigated in theoretical seismology as compared to the standing - wave regime of vibrations of both solid fs stars and such solid celestial objects as earth - like planets ( e.g. lapwood & usami 1981 , lay & wallace 1995 , aki & richards 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , in ( bastrukov et al 2007b , 2008a ) , a case of the elastic - force - driven nodeless shear oscillations , both torsional  @xmath9 and spheroidal  @xmath10 , entrapped in the finite - depth crust @xmath11 of core - crust model of a solid star has been studied in some details with remarkable inference that dipole overtones of spheroidal and torsion nodeless elastic shear vibrations of crust against immobile core exhibit features generic to goldstone soft modes . on",
    "the other hand one can casts doubt on arguments of model presuming that detected qpos have been brought about by vibrations restored by solely solid - mechanical force of hooke s elastic stresses because such interpretation rests on the poorly justifiable assumption of the dynamically passive role of ultra strong magnetic field , as defining only direction of the axis about which the stellar matter undergo differentially rotational fluctuations , i.e. , that magnetic field frozen in the star remains unaltered in this process . bearing this in mind and assuming that the admixture of charged particles ( basically electrons and protons ) imparts to neutron - dominated fermi - matter of these star mechanical properties of perfectly conducting material",
    ", it seems more plausible to expect that post - quake relaxation should be strongly affected by lorentz force of magnetic field stresses setting highly conducting material in rotational motion about axis of the dipole magnetic moment of the star .    with this in mind , in ( bastrukov et al 2009a , 2009b ) ,",
    "the above data have been analyzed in the model of a solid star undergoing global torsional nodeless vibrations about magnetic axis under the joint action of lorentz force of magentic field stresses and hooke s force of elastic shear stresses .",
    "and it was found that such a model provides fairly reasonable account of general trends in data on qpo frequencies for sgr 1900 + 14 and data for sgr 1900 + 14 for frequencies from the range @xmath12 hz , but faces serious difficulties in interpreting the low - frequency vibrations with @xmath13 and @xmath14 hz in the sgr 1806 - 20 data .",
    "also , the model of global torsional vibrations of solid star with froze - in homogeneous magnetic field leaves some uncertainties regarding the nature of vibrations with @xmath15 and @xmath16 hz .",
    "this last issue has been scrutinized in recent work ( bastrukov et al 2009b ) from the standpoint of a solid star model with non - homogeneous poloidal magnetic field of well - known ferraro s form and was found that these high - frequency qpos can be properly interpreted as being produced by global alfvn node - free torsional vibrations of very high overtones .    in the meantime , it has been argued some time ago in the studies of pulsar glitches as being produced by star quakes ( bastrukov et al 1996 , 1997 , 1999b ) that post - glitch relaxation should most likely be dominated by alfvn oscillations of crustal electron - nuclear solid - state plasma ( composed of immobile nuclei dispersed in degenerate fermi - gas of relativistic electrons ) about axis of magnetic field frozen in the immobile core ( and , also , by less dense gaseous plasma expelled from the surface by starquake ) . from the view point of core - crust model of quaking neutron star ( franco et al 2000 ) ,",
    "there are two way of thinking why only peripheral region of the star can be set in lorentz - force - driven alfvn vibrations .",
    "first belong to a case when strength of seismic tremor is fairly week and perturbation sets in vibrations only finite - depth crustal region of the star , leaving massive core unaltered .",
    "the second way , when core material just incapable of sustaining alfvn vibrations .",
    "one of the main conditions for existing of such vibrations is the extremely large ( effectively infinite ) electrical conductivity of stellar substance ( e.g. , chandrasekhar 1961 , mestel 1999 ) , but this may not be the case for core material whose microscopic composition is dominated , according to canonical understanding of neutron star , by matter possessing properties of non - conducting degenerate fermi - gas of non - relativistic neutrons .",
    "the physically meaningful framework for discussion of this second case provides the two - component , core - crust , model of quaking paramagnetic neutron star , pictured in fig.1 , that has been extensively discussed some time ago in works ( bastrukov et al 2001 , 2002a , 2002b , 2003 ) . in this model , the role of major source of super strong magnetic field of the star is attributed to permanently magnetized massive core composed of degenerate neutron matter in the the state of pauli s paramagnetic saturation in which magnetic moments of neutrons turn out aligned in the direction of frozen - in magnetic field that has been inherited by neutron star from massive progenitor and amplified in the implosive process of its gravitational collapse . unlike the non - conducting core matter , the material of crust matter resembles metallic solid .",
    "this suggests that it is magnetic cohesion between metal - like crust and permanent - magnet - like core , mediated by lines of ultra strong magnetic field , should play main part in the the starquake dynamics . in this paper",
    "we adopt this latter point of view by considering starquake as impulsive release of magnetic field energy by means of disruption of magnetic field lines on the core - crust interface and fracturing the crust by relived magnetic stresses . in some sense",
    "the magnetic field lines can be thought of as a super - hard piles endowing core - crust composition of neutron star with supplementary ( to gravity forces ) stiffness which is primarily responsible for its seismic stability to quake - induced tectonic shear displacements of crust against corehe atoms .",
    "according to current theory , the emergence of superfluidity in flowing boson material substances belongs to phase transition of macroscopic fraction of bosons to the state of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "one of the most striking features of such phase transition is that at the temperature of condensation the internal pressure of bec state vanishes . the fact that bose - matter composed of paired neutrons in bec state is unable to withstand the pressure of self - gravity ( contrary to the degenerate neutron fermi - matter whose zero - temperature pressure of degeneracy counterbalancing the self - gravity pressure is central to the very notion of neutron star )",
    "suggests that such a matter , if exists , can only insufficiently contribute to the total mass budget of neutron star , otherwise the very notion of this compact object is loosing its original meaning . in the starquake of paramagnetic neutron star model under consideration , this inner crust material is thought of as operating like a lubricant facilitating non - compressional differentially rotational shear displacements of crust relative to much denser matter of massive core . ] .",
    "it is expected that quake - induced disruptions of magnetic field lines , along which the outgoing radiation is developed , should be observed as glitches in the quiescent high - energy emission .",
    "these glitches are of substantially magnetic nature in the sense that they owe its origin to well - known effect of sudden , jump - like , increase in the magnetic field strength triggered by thermonuclear explosion . with this in mind",
    "we focus on reaction of the star on above quake - induced perturbation by node - free differentially rotational , torsional , vibrations of crustal solid - state plasma about axis of magnetic field frozen in the immobile paramagnetic core .    in section 2 ,",
    "a brief outline is given of the equations of solid - magnetics appropriate for the perfectly conducting viscoelastic continuous medium pervaded by a magnetic field . in section 3 , the spectral formulae for the frequency and lifetime of this toroidal mode of non - radial nodeless vibrations driven by combined magnetic lorentz and elastic hooke s forces are obtained .",
    "the relevance of considered asteroseismic model to the detected qpos in the x - ray flux during the flare of sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 is assessed in section 4 .",
    "the newly obtained results are briefly summarized in section 5 .",

    ", the analysis of data on qpos frequencies has been based on assumption that detected qpos owe their existence to torsional nodeless vibrations restored by joint action of lorentz magnetic and hooke s elastic forces and we have found that obtained three - parametric spectral formula provides much better fit of data than two - parametric frequency spectrum of the early considered model of global magneto - elastic vibrations ( bastrukov et al 2009a ) . in second case of vibrations restored by solely lorentz force of magnetic field stresses we found that obtained two - parametric frequency spectrum can too be fairly reasonably reconciled with detected qpos frequencies . with all",
    "above in mind we conclude that main part in quake - induced torsional vibrations of crustal solid - state plasma about axis of magnetic field frozen in the immobile core plays lorentz restoring force of magnetic field stresses and that observed frequencies of qpos can be interpreted as an indirect evidence for permanent magnetization of super dense matter in the deep interior of magnetars .",

    "<S> we investigate an asteroseismic model of non - rotating paramagnetic neutron star with core - crust stratification of interior pervaded by homogeneous internal and dipolar external magnetic field , presuming that neutron degenerate fermi - matter of the star core is in the state of pauli s paramagnetic permanent magnetization caused by polarization of spin magnetic moments of neutrons along the axis of magnetic field of collapsed massive progenitor . the magnetic cohesion between metal - like crust and permanent - magnet - like core is considered as playing a main part in the dynamics of starquake . </S>",
    "<S> this process is thought of as impulsive release of magnetic field stresses , brought about by disruption of magnetic field lines on the core - crust interface resulting in the crust fracture , which is followed by tectonic shear displacements of crust against massive core . </S>",
    "<S> focus is laid on the post - quake relaxation of the star by node - free torsional vibrations of highly conducting crustal solid - state plasma , composed of nuclei embedded in the degenerate fermi - gas of relativistic electrons , about axis of magnetic field frozen in the immobile paramagnetic core . </S>",
    "<S> two scenarios of these axisymmetric seismic vibrations are examined , in first of which these are considered as maintained by combined action of lorentz magnetic and hooke s elastic forces and in second one by solely lorentz force . </S>",
    "<S> the damping is attributed to shear viscosity of crustal material . </S>",
    "<S> based on the energy variational method of magneto - solid - mechanical theory of elastic continuous medium , the spectral formulae for the frequency and lifetime of this toroidal mode are obtained and discussed in the context of theoretical treatment of recently discovered quasi - periodic oscillations of the x - ray outburst flux from sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 as being produced by above seismic vibrations .    </S>",
