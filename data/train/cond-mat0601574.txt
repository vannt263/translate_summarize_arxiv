    "mnas is an extremely promising material for magneto - electronics , since it can grow epitaxially on gaas @xcite and si @xcite forming clean and atomically sharp interfaces . @xcite",
    "mnas / gaas heterojunctions have been extensively studied experimentally , @xcite and spin injection from mnas into gaas has been demonstrated.@xcite however one of the major drawbacks for the use of mnas in devices is the fact that bulk mnas has a phase transition at 318  k , where the magnetic state changes from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic . moreover when grown on gaas , this temperature changes depending on the growth direction .",
    "this is mainly attributed to the induced strain .",
    "@xcite the aim of this paper is to use _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations to develop a theory of the phase transitions of mnas , which can be compared with experiments and with existing phenomenological models .",
    "first a review of the experimental properties of mnas is presented , and a brief description of the existing phenomenological models is given . then the results of our _ ab initio _ calculations are presented and compared to experiments and phenomenological models . within the scope of a heisenberg model",
    "the exchange coupling constants are calculated for different distorted unit cells , and the curie temperature and its dependence on the lattice parameters are evaluated in the mean field approximation .",
    "the use of the heisenberg model also makes possible the prediction of the ground state volume and lattice structure for the paramagnetic state .",
    "it will be shown that the phase transitions of mnas can indeed be explained by _",
    "ab initio _ calculations . in the last section our results",
    "are summarized and a simple model for the susceptibility as function of temperature is given . from these a semi - quantitative description of the phase diagram of mnas will emerge .",
    "mnas is a ferromagnetic metal at low temperature , but it becomes paramagnetic at @xmath0 k. at this critical temperature the magnetic moment changes abruptly from a finite value to zero ( figure  [ fig : moft ] ) , the resistivity increases discontinuously , @xcite the volume is reduced by 2.1% , and the lattice structure changes from the hexagonal b@xmath1 ( nias - type ) to the orthorhombic b31 ( mnp - type ) structure .",
    "@xcite the b31 structure is obtained by slightly distorting the b@xmath1 structure .",
    "associated with this transition there is a latent heat of 7490 j / kg . @xcite",
    "furthermore the phase transition shows hysteresis with a critical temperature of 307  k upon cooling and of 318  k upon heating.@xcite all these properties clearly indicate that the phase transition is of first order .",
    "magnetization per mn atom @xmath2 as a function of temperature for ferromagnetic mnas below 318 k , and inverse susceptibility @xmath3 for paramagnetic mnas above 318 k ( schematically after reference [ ] ) .,width=302 ]    above @xmath4 the distortion of the crystal structure reduces continuously , until it vanishes at @xmath5 k. @xcite at @xmath6 mnas undergoes another phase transition , where it changes back from the b31 structure to the b@xmath1 structure .",
    "the lattice dimensions change continuously and there is no latent heat , but only a discontinuity in the heat capacity of the material .",
    "therefore this phase transition is of second order . for temperatures between @xmath4 and @xmath6 the paramagnetic susceptibility of the material",
    "has an anomalous behavior .",
    "it increases with increasing temperature until it reaches a maximum at @xmath6 . above @xmath6",
    "it decreases and has a curie - weiss behavior ( figure  [ fig : moft ] ) .",
    "moreover at @xmath6 there is a lambda point in the specific heat .",

    "the ferromagnetic b@xmath1 structure becomes unstable , and the material has the b31 structure for all temperatures below @xmath6 . at high pressures and low temperatures",
    "different types of ordered magnetic structures are found , with a reduced saturation magnetic moment with respect to the zero pressure ferromagnetic phase .",
    "this , together with the anomalous behavior of the susceptibility between @xmath4 and @xmath6 , led goodenough to the idea that the magnetic moment of the mn atoms changes from a high spin state in the b@xmath1 structure to a low spin state in the b31 structure .",
    "@xcite according to his idea in the b31 structure the moment of the mn atoms lies between 1 and 2 @xmath15 .",
    "however neutron scattering experiments on mnas samples in the b31 structure have shown that the local magnetic moment of the mn atoms lies between 3 and 3.4 @xmath15 for different temperatures and pressures , @xcite in clear contradiction to the assumption of a low spin state .",
    "canted spin structures , similar to the helimagnetic structures of mnp , @xcite are found at a pressure of 4.75 kbar below 210 k , with a local magnetic moment of about 3 @xmath15 .",
    "the different saturation magnetic moments for different pressures therefore correspond to different types of canted magnetic alignments .",
    "a hysteresis region lies between the ferromagnetic and the canted regions , where both the b8@xmath16 and the b31 structures can be stabilized .",

    "the b@xmath1 structure consists of stacked hexagonal layers of mn and as atoms , and the unit cell contains two mn and two as atoms .",
    "the b31 structure has twice the volume of the b@xmath1 due to symmetry lowering and contains four mn and four as atoms .",
    "the lattice is nearly hexagonal , and the atoms are moved out of the hexagonal symmetry points along the @xmath22 and @xmath24 directions ( figure [ fig : uc : ortho ] ) .    the mn atoms are mainly displaced in the hexagonal plane along the @xmath22 direction , to form chains of closer mn atoms , separated from the other chains by a larger distance ( figure [ fig : ortho_2d ] ) .",
    "the as atoms are mainly displaced along the @xmath24 axis . in each unit cell one of the planar as atoms is moved upwards and the other downwards with respect to the original position in the b8@xmath16 structure , so as to keep the mn - as distance nearly constant .",
    "the displacement @xmath25 of the mn atoms in the hexagonal plane lies between 0 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , depending on the temperature and pressure , and the displacement @xmath28 of the as atoms along the @xmath19-axis lies between 0 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",

    ", width=245 ]    the lattice parameters of mnas as function of temperature and magnetic field have been measured in several works [ ] .",
    "figure [ fig : acoft ] shows the change of the lattice parameters as a function of temperature for zero pressure.@xcite the lattice parameters increase with temperature due to normal thermal expansion .",
    "however the in plane lattice parameter @xmath36 decreases when the temperatures get near @xmath4 , where it jumps from @xmath37   to the lower value of @xmath38  .",
    "the perpendicular lattice parameter @xmath19 always increases continuously with temperature . at @xmath6",
    "there is an inflection in the slope of the lattice parameter as a function of temperature , and at about @xmath39 k the slope changes discontinuously . in other measurements",
    "the discontinuous change of the slope is found at about 410 k.@xcite    the exact temperature at which the distortion disappears is somewhat uncertain , and fluctuations may play a role for small distortions .",
    "the given temperature for the disappearing of the distortion correspond to @xmath40 k , @xcite however measurements for small distortions are difficult and such temperature can only be inferred .",
    "as pointed out in reference [ ] the distortion should appear at temperatures slightly above @xmath6 . throughout this work",
    "we assume that the disappearing of the distortion occurs at @xmath41 , which the temperature where the thermal expansion coefficient of mnas changes abruptly .          until the fifties it was believed that the first order phase transition at @xmath4 was between a ferromagnetic and an antiferromagnetic state .",
    "kittel then proposed a model where the distortion from the b@xmath1 to the b31 structure produces the change in sign of one of the exchange coupling constants , giving rise to antiferromagnetic order.@xcite however there was no experimental evidence of this antiferromagnetic state and experiments demonstrated that the transition is instead to a paramagnetic state .",
    "@xcite    therefore bean and rodbell ( br ) proposed a modification of kittel s theory , where the exchange interactions are ferromagnetic for both structures , but they are much weaker in the b31 phase .",
    "@xcite the main idea is that the exchange interaction decays strongly as the volume decreases . in order to simplify the model ,",
    "the analysis was based on the extrapolated curie temperature @xmath42 only , and not on the details of the magnetic interaction at the atomic level .",
    "furthermore the model neglected the anisotropic change of the crystal structure , and assumed that it is possible to describe the change from the b@xmath1 to the b31 structure by a change in volume only .",
    "the dependence of @xmath42 on the volume @xmath43 was described by the following equation @xmath44~ , \\label{eq : tcbr}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the curie temperature at the volume @xmath46 , which is the volume that the system would have in the hypothetical absence of exchange interaction . in this context",
    "this corresponds to the volume of the b31 structure above @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath47 is a parameter and is determined by fitting the model to experiments . within the br model one can show that for certain values of @xmath47 a first order phase transition between a ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state occurs with a simultaneous change of the volume .",
    "however the model does not explain the second order phase transition at @xmath6 .",
    "further improvements such as the introduction of a term proportional to @xmath48 do not change the main results.@xcite    later goodenough made an attempt to explain the anomalous behavior of the susceptibility and the second order phase transition at @xmath6 by extending the br model and assuming that the local magnetic moment on the mn atoms depends strongly on the volume .",
    "@xcite here the mn atoms are assumed to be in a high spin state in the b@xmath1 structure and in a low spin state in the b31 structure .",
    "@xcite however measurements of the local magnetic moment show that the change in the magnetic moment at @xmath4 is very small , therefore the goodenough model is not applicable to this phase transition .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the mnas unit cell volume in any crystalline structure is too big to justify a high - spin to low - spin transition .",
    "in fact in mnas@xmath49p@xmath50 the change from high - spin to low - spin state is observed , @xcite however the low spin state is found for unit cell volumes smaller than 120 @xmath51 .",
    "in contrast the unit cell of mnas has always a volume of around 130 @xmath51 , and it is always in the high - spin state .    in 1982",
    "kato et al . extended the br model by taking into account not only the change in volume , but also the change of the crystal structure .",
    "@xcite furthermore instead of just using @xmath42 for describing the magnitude of the exchange interactions , they consider exchange coupling constants up to second nearest neighbors .",
    "the obtained results are similar to those of bean and rodbell .",
    "the second order phase transition at @xmath6 is explained by assuming that locally the structure above @xmath6 is still the b31 , but that the distortions from the b@xmath1 are randomly distributed .",
    "this assumption is probably not valid , since neutron diffraction experiments clearly indicate that the structure is a regular b@xmath1 above @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite    a landau - type phenomenological model , where the free energy @xmath52 is expanded as a function of order parameters , is given in references [ ] and references therein . in reference",
    "[ ] just two order parameters are used , the relative magnetization @xmath53 ( @xmath54 for a ferromagnetic state , @xmath55 for a paramagnetic state ) and the orthorhombic distortion @xmath56 .",
    "the following equation is used for the free energy : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are expansion coefficients to be fitted to experiment , @xmath60 is an external magnetic field , @xmath61 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath45 is the extrapolated curie temperate of the low temperature phase , and @xmath62 is a constant .",
    "the distortion @xmath56 plays the same role as the relative change in volume @xmath63 of the br model ( equation ) . in equation @xmath42",
    "depends linearly on the change in volume , whereas now it depends quadratically on the distortion @xmath56 , @xmath64 .",
    "this is the correct expansion of @xmath42 , since the linear term in @xmath56 disappears due to symmetry ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 correspond to the same distortion ) .",
    "the terms in @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 appear also in the br model and lead to the first order transition at @xmath4 .",
    "the second order phase transition at @xmath70 is generated by the @xmath71 and @xmath72 terms in the expansion .",
    "also the variation of the magnetic moment with the distortion is contained in the model , although the authors find that the coefficient @xmath73 is essentially zero .",
    "for @xmath45 the curie temperature extrapolated from the high temperature susceptibility above @xmath6 was considered ( @xmath74  k ) , and for @xmath75 the temperature at which the inverse susceptibility has a minimum ( @xmath76  k ) . by construction",
    "this model yields the correct thermodynamic behavior , and also predicts the increase of the susceptibility between @xmath4 and @xmath6 by means of the reduction of the distortion with increasing temperature .",
    "variations of this model [ ] give similar results .",
    "in reference [ ] the full @xmath20-@xmath18-@xmath60 phase diagram of mnas is explained with a landau - type expansion , where more order parameters are used .",
    "however also in this case a term equivalent to @xmath77 of equation is used in order to obtain the phase transition at @xmath75 . despite the fact that landau - type expansions give very good agreement between theory and experiments",
    "when the right parameters are used , they do not provide insights into the origin of the terms of the expansion , especially of the @xmath77 term . in reference [ ] a basic justification of such term",
    "is given from first principles within a spin fluctuation theory constructed from a hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "it is shown that for a given volume the minimum of the free energy can lie at @xmath78 for a ferromagnetic state or at @xmath79 for a paramagnetic state .    in 1986 - 87",
    "motizuki and katoh used spin fluctuation theory in order to explain the anomalous behavior of the susceptibility between @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite a hubbard hamiltonian was used , with model density of states obtained from first principle calculations .",
    "they could qualitatively show that the susceptibility increases when going from the b31 structure to the b@xmath1 structure , again mainly due to the fact that @xmath42 increases with increasing temperature .",
    "more recently various tight binding @xcite as well as first principles@xcite calculations have been performed for mnas in the b@xmath1 structure .",
    "the results generally agree and compare well with the experiments .",
    "only two studies on mnas in the b31 structure are known to the authors .",
    "@xcite in reference [ ] a description of the paramagnetic state of the b31 structure is given by assuming that the paramagnetic state coincides with zero local magnetic moment of the mn atoms .",
    "this does not correspond to the usual way of describing paramagnetism , which rather corresponds to constant local magnetic moments , whose directions in space change randomly in time due to spin fluctuations .",
    "the present work investigates the magnetic interactions across the various phase transitions of mnas .",
    "an explanation of the magnetostructural properties in terms of first - principles calculations is given , thereby illustrating the origin and providing a justification of the parameters used by the different models .",
    "first principles calculations within density functional theory ( dft ) are performed using the pseudopotential code based on localized atomic orbitals siesta .",
    "@xcite the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) is used for the exchange correlation potential,@xcite since it has been shown to give good structural properties for hexagonal mnas . @xcite in the valence we consider @xmath80 and @xmath81 orbitals for mn , and @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 for as . for both mn and as double zeta polarized local orbitals are used for the @xmath85 and @xmath86 angular momenta , whereas for the @xmath56 orbitals double zeta is used .",
    "the number of @xmath87-points in the brillouin zone is specified by a grid cutoff of 20  .",
    "this corresponds to a 11@xmath8811@xmath888 mesh for the b@xmath1 unit cell , giving approximately 1000 @xmath87-points in the full brillouin zone .",
    "for the b31 unit cell such cutoff yields a 8@xmath8811@xmath887 mesh .",
    "the real space mesh cutoff , which determines the density of the real space grid , is 300 ry .",

    "the lattice parameters at 110 k can be extracted from figure [ fig : acoft ] and are @xmath95   and @xmath96  .",
    "this demonstrates that gga - dft reproduces rather well the zero temperature ground state .    for a fixed @xmath97 ratio of 1.54 , which is close to the experimental value at the first order phase transition , the energy is minimized for @xmath98  , which compares well with the results of other _ ab initio _ calculations .",

    "the different antiferromagnetic states are @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . as a matter of notation @xmath100 means that the atoms 1 and 2 in the unit cell have opposite magnetic moment than that of atoms 3 and 4 .",

    "for the hexagonal cell ( @xmath78 ) the equation reads @xmath328,\\ ] ] where @xmath329 and @xmath330 .",
    "this has to be valid for all temperatures where the cell is hexagonal , therefore it can not be assumed that the ratio between @xmath19 and @xmath36 is constant since it changes abruptly from 1.533 to 1.556 at @xmath4 . by using the expression for @xmath311 from equation",
    "we obtain @xmath282 @xmath331 as reference curie temperature the extrapolated value to room temperature is used , which can be estimated to be about @xmath332  , @xmath333=360 k. by inserting the experimental values for the parameters on the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq : kv ] ) we obtain @xmath334 .",
    "this is about twice as big as our predicted value .",
    "the disagreement may be due to the fact that the ratio between @xmath272 and @xmath271 has been fixed for our calculated value . by inserting this value for @xmath282 in equation",
    "we obtain @xmath335 k , the curie temperature for the lattice parameters at @xmath336 .    in order to extract @xmath283 from experiments we use the relative change in the slope of the inverse susceptibility around @xmath337 .",
    "this is , according to the equations and , @xmath338 and increases with increasing @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "all the variables in this equation can be derived from the experimental measurements , except @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "experimentally different values are found for the relative change of the slope ( left hand side of equation ( [ eq : slope ] ) ) .",
    "@xcite these are all of the order of @xmath339 . by using this value for the relative change of the slope and the previously calculated value @xmath334 , @xmath283 is found to be @xmath340 .",
    "this value agrees approximately with our predicted value of @xmath341 .    in conclusion",
    "the table [ tab : paramdftexp ] summarizes the parameters calculated in this work , by comparing our _ ab initio _ results obtained from the dft calculations and the heisenberg model , with the results obtained by fitting to the experimental data .",
    "in general there is a fair agreement , although the the dft results underestimate @xmath282 and overestimate @xmath283 .",

    "first the state of mnas at zero pressure is considered .",
    "for @xmath344 and temperatures below 155  k both ferromagnetic and canted spin structures can be stabilized .",
    "the ground state is the ferromagnetic b8@xmath16 structure , however also the b31 structure is stable , because at these low temperatures the thermal energy is not large enough to induce a phase transition from a canted spin structure to a ferromagnetic one . as the temperature increases above 155  k the thermal fluctuation may induce the phase transition , and therefore only the ferromagnetic state survives .",
    "as the temperature is further increased and the system becomes paramagnetic , the b31 structure becomes the stable state , as described in section [ disttp ] ( figure [ fig : ene_od ] ) .",
    "mnas then remains paramagnetic for all temperatures , but because of the thermal expansion the orthogonal distortion decreases , until it vanishes when a critical volume is reached ( see figure [ fig : d_of_v ] )",
    ". then the volume becomes large enough to stabilize the b@xmath1 structure even for a paramagnetic state , leading to the second structural phase transition at @xmath6 .",
    "as pressure is applied to the system the volume is reduced and thus the ferromagnetic exchange interaction decreases .",
    "therefore @xmath4 decreases with pressure , while @xmath6 increases . at a temperature of approximately 230  k",
    "the ferromagnetic state is stable up to a pressure of 2kbar .",
    "for high pressures above 2.5 - 4  kbar the volume is small enough that canted spin structures become the ground state .",
    "the temperature at which these states become paramagnetic is approximately 230 k. it increases slightly with pressure , reflecting the fact that the antiferromagnetic interaction increases as the volume is reduced .",
    "we have investigated by means of _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations the magneto - structural properties of mnas . the stable structure for the ferromagnetic state is found to be the b8@xmath16 structure .",
    "however if antiferromagnetic alignment in the hexagonal plane is imposed the b31 structure becomes more stable . by fitting the dft total energies of different magnetic configurations to a heisenberg type energy it is shown that the main contributions to the physical properties originate from the exchange coupling parameters up to 3rd nearest neighbor .",
    "the curie temperature was calculated in the mean field approximation , with values approximately twice as large as the experimental ones .",
    "the main assumption of the phenomenological model of bean and rodbell @xcite that the ferromagnetic exchange coupling parameters increase when the volume is increased has been confirmed ( equation ) using this analysis .",
    "however it has been shown that the exchange interactions depend not only on the volume , but that the orthogonal distortion to the b31 structure plays an important role . for the experimentally observed distortions some of the in - plane exchange coupling coefficients become antiferromagnetic .",
    "this is the reason for the stability of the b31 structure for those configurations of the magnetic moments that have an antiferromagnetic component in the hexagonal plane .",
    "different canted spin structures are expected to minimize the energy for different distortions , since there are both positive and negative exchange coefficients depending on the amount of distortion of the b31 structure .",
    "furthermore it has been shown that for paramagnetic states the b31 structure is stable at small volumes , while the b@xmath1 structure is stable above a critical lattice constant of about 3.7  .",
    "this explains the second order phase transition at @xmath6 , since at that temperature the lattice constant crosses this critical value .",
    "the curie temperature has been expanded as a function of the lattice vectors and of the amount of distortion .",
    "an increase in the volume leads to an enhancement of the curie temperature , while an increase of the distortion leads to a reduction . with these results in hand",
    "the increase of the susceptibility between @xmath4 and @xmath6 has been explained as the result of the increase of the curie temperature due to the change of the structure from the b31 to the b@xmath1 and to the increase of the volume . by using the experimental variation of the lattice parameters with increasing temperature the susceptibility",
    "is indeed found to increase between @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "a fit of the dependence of the curie temperature on the lattice parameters to best reproduce the experimental behavior is also given .",
    "the calculated values agree within a factor of two with the values obtained by the _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "our results are in agreement with the phenomenological models based on the bean rodbell idea .",
    "but now the various parameters used are derived from first principles and therefore validated ."
