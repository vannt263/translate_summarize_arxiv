    "it is much smaller than the present case with na current scale .",
    "this implies that the dqd is an promising candidate serving as the basis of the photovoltaic application .",
    "the behavior of the photon current with the variation of voltage is similar to the electron current , which also exhibits large suppression near the terminal voltage .",
    "however , the terminal voltage is larger than that ( @xmath98 ) for the electron current [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) ] .",
    "this is understandable as follows : with finite @xmath10 , the dot system has electron current from left to right under positive voltage in absence of the electron - photon interaction .",
    "after the electron - photon coupling is included , the photon absorption by quantum dots generates the electron current against the voltage bias , originating from the quantum photovoltaic effect .",
    "therefore , the electron current is composed by two competing sources : ( i ) intrinsic tunneling between qds generates downhill current under positive voltage , which gives negative contribution to the electron current , and ( ii ) photon - generated uphill current gives crucial positive contribution . before the vanishing of the photon current",

    "the photovoltaic power @xmath101 is proportional to @xmath91 , until reaching a maximal power , since the electron current @xmath102 keeps almost constant .",

    "the maximum quantum efficiency @xmath104 of the dqd engine is then obtained near @xmath98 , as plotted inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) .",

    "the photovoltaic current arises quickly with the increasing tunneling ( @xmath110 ) , which is also observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . as the tunneling strength reaches the moderate regime , the electron current peaks at @xmath111  ev .",
    "after the peak , the current shows monotonic decay . for the behavior of the photon current , it is similar to the electron current , except for the magnitude difference . as we discussed above , in absence of inter - dot tunneling , two dqs are decoupled and no photon will be pumped into the dots to generate uphill current , which is clearly exhibited in eq .",
    "( [ ip1 ] ) . therefore ,",
    "to obtain photovoltaic effect , finite @xmath10 is necessary . in the opposite direction of strong tunneling ,",
    "the population polarization is very small , and photons can be hardly pumped into the system due to the suppressed electron - photon interaction shown in eq .",

    "this detailed balance relation finally gives us @xmath117 where @xmath118 denotes the electronic reservoirs ( solar environment ) temperature and @xmath119 is the ideal carnot efficiency .",
    "this rough estimation qualitatively agrees with the numerical exact result in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) , and the slight deviation comes from the weak inter - dot tunneling , which reduces @xmath98 compared to the ideal one at eq .",
    "( [ voc1 ] ) . from these results ,",
    "it is interesting to find that below the optimal tunneling ( @xmath111  ev in our case ) , both the photovoltaic current and voltage are enhanced by the tunneling strength .",
    "thus , the best operation regime is around the optimal tunneling , where the maximum output power will be obtained .",
    "this feature is explicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) .",
