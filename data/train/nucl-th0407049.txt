    "the photoproduction of two pions on nucleons at low and intermediate energies ( up to @xmath0 ) has been the subject of intense experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite study .",
    "the works have been mainly motivated to understand the role of the many baryonic resonances involved in the process .",
    "the fact that there are three particles in the final state , @xmath1 , gives way to different mechanisms in which baryonic resonances play an important role , and this has led to obtain useful information on some resonances not attainable with other reactions .",
    "much of the work has been done in unpolarized observables , mostly total cross sections and invariant mass distributions . in particular , the work of @xcite , which is the one we will use along this work , is based on around @xmath2 feynman diagrams considering the coupling of photons to several baryonic resonances able to influence the energy region up to @xmath3 . the main advantage is the use of no free parameters .",
    "this model succeeded in reproducing total cross sections and invariant mass distributions for all the charge channels with a good accuracy , not only in nucleons but also in nuclei .",
    "specially remarkable was the application of the model of @xcite to the study of the photoproduction of two pions in nuclei @xcite .",
    "it succeeded in describing the shift of strength in the double pion invariant mass distribution towards the @xmath4 masses , due to the modification of the @xmath5-meson mass in nuclear matter , where the @xmath5-meson is dynamically generated as a @xmath6 rescattering in scalar - isoscalar channel .",
    "this prediction was confirmed by the experiment of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the model of @xcite has widely proven his efficiency in reproducing and predicting unpolarized observables in the energy range from threshold up to @xmath7 .",
    "nonetheless , a more demanding test to the model can be done by evaluating polarization observables , since it can be sensible to details of the model not visible when integrating over polarization degrees of freedom in the unpolarized observables . in this line ,",
    "a test of the model of @xcite was done in @xcite when evaluating the spin @xmath8 and @xmath9 amplitudes and the contribution to the gdh sum rule of the double pion channel , in fair agreement with mainz results @xcite , and the evaluation of beam asymmetries under experimental study at graal @xcite .",
    "these observables are based on differences of total differential cross sections dependent on polarization , which provide a valuable information on the internal dynamics of the reaction .",
    "however , these observables still rely on integrated cross sections and no angular distributions are provided from where more information can be obtained .",
    "the aim of the present work is to evaluate angular dependences of the cross section asymmetry @xmath10 for the absorption of circularly polarized photons by unpolarized protons .",
    "this observable is very sensitive to the internal mechanisms of the reaction and , therefore , can be a very useful test to impose constraints on the theoretical models .",
    "the work has been partly motivated by preliminary experimental results , for the @xmath11 channel , with the clas detector at jefferson lab @xcite which shows strong and not trivial angular dependences of this observable , and prospects of measurements at mainz @xcite for the @xmath12 channel .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the model of @xcite for the double pion photoproduction on nucleons .",
    "this model is intended to reproduce the total cross sections and invariant mass distributions up to photon energies of @xmath14 .",
    "the model is based on a set of tree level mechanisms , depicted in fig .",

    "these feynman diagrams involve pions , @xmath29-mesons , nucleons and nucleonic and @xmath30 resonances .",
    "the baryon resonances included in the model are : @xmath30(1232 ) or @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , i=3/2 ) , @xmath33(1440 ) or @xmath34 ( @xmath35 , i=1/2 ) , @xmath33(1520 ) or @xmath36 ( @xmath37 , i=1/2 ) and @xmath30(1700 ) or @xmath38 ( @xmath37 , i=3/2 ) . the contribution of the @xmath39 is small but it was included due to the important role played by that resonance in the @xmath40 reaction and the fact that the excitation of the @xmath39 peaks around @xmath41 photon energy in the @xmath42 scattering .",
    "the @xmath43 has a large coupling to the photons and is an important ingredient due to its interference with the dominant term of the process , the @xmath44 transition called the @xmath30-kroll - ruderman ( @xmath30kr ) contact term .",
    "( the @xmath30kr term is not present in the @xmath12 channel ) .",
    "several @xmath29 and @xmath30(1700 ) terms were included in the last version of the model @xcite because of important interference effects .",
    "the consideration of the @xmath29 terms was of crucial importance in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , when studying @xmath29 meson photoproduction in nuclei .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 diagrams considering a @xmath29 exchange were not considered in @xcite since they give negligible contribution to the cross section in the energy region of concern .",

    "no other resonances were considered in the model since they can not appreciably change the results in the energy range up to @xmath14 , because their widths are small and lie at too high energies , because the helicity amplitudes are small , because the decay width rates into @xmath47 or @xmath48 are small or because a combination of various of these effects @xcite .    the diagrams u ) , v ) and x ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] are the main modifications of @xcite with respect to @xcite . in the first work of @xcite they included more than @xmath49 diagrams for the @xmath50 channel , but many of them were shown to be negligible at energies up to @xmath51 .",
    "the non - negligible contributions come from the diagrams of fig .",

    "the amplitudes are evaluated from effective interaction lagrangians which are shown in the appendices of ref .",
    "@xcite , using a non relativistic approximation exact up to order @xmath52 , that is , removing terms of order @xmath53 and higher .",
    "it is important to stress that this model has no free parameters , in the sense that there is no parameter to be fitted to the experimental double pion photoproduction observable .",
    "all input needed is obtained uniquely from properties of resonances and their decays . where there are doubts about relative signs of couplings , one resorts to quark models or chiral perturbation theory to fix them @xcite .",
    "we will consider the absorption of circularly polarized photons by non - polarized protons .",
    "for real photons the polarization vectors of a circularly polarized photon can be expressed as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 or @xmath56 represent a right - handed or left - handed circularly polarized photon respectively .",
    "the helicity asymmetry that we are going to consider in the present work can be defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the differential cross section for the interaction of a right - handed ( left - handed ) circularly polarized photon with an unpolarized proton .",
    "three different frames have been commonly used in the literature to describe angular distributions in three body final state processes @xcite .",
    "these frames are called _ gottfried - jackson _ , _ helicity _ and _ adair _ systems , differing in the choice of the @xmath59 axis from which the azimuthal and polar angles are defined .",
    "the choice of a particular frame is of relevance when studying particular production processes , like vector - meson photoproduction , due to particular angular distributions for a certain spin of the intermediate meson . in the present work , in order to test all the possible mechanisms contributing to the @xmath11 process , any of these frames is useful for our purposes .",
    "therefore , in order to allow comparison with preliminary experimental results with the clas detector at jefferson lab @xcite , we will use the _ helicity _ frame , which is defined as having the @xmath59 axis in the direction of the sum of the momentum of both pions in the overall ( @xmath60 ) c.m .",
    "the use of the other frames would produce similar qualitative results for the discussion done in the present work . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematics ] the kinematics for the @xmath61 reaction in this _ helicity _ frame is shown .",
    "the @xmath62 angle , which we will use along the present work , accounts for the angle between the scattering plane ( containing the photon , @xmath63 , and the final proton , @xmath64 ) and the plane containing the two pions , and is defined by :    @xmath65    with @xmath66 , and with all the momenta in the overall center of mass frame .",

    "there is an interesting necessary condition for the helicity asymmetry @xmath85 , that is @xmath86 this is true since the change @xmath87 can be interpreted as a reflection of the @xmath88 plane with respect to the @xmath89 plane ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : diagrams ] ) it is possible to have a @xmath115 in the @xmath126 vertex and a @xmath116 in the @xmath127 vertex or vice - versa , while in the @xmath117 mechanism only the diagram where the @xmath115 is in the @xmath128 vertex and the @xmath116 in the @xmath129 vertex is possible . if we take any individual diagram the asymmetry will necessarily vanish .",
    "this is so since the general complex structure of propagators is the same in all the pieces of the amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalt ] ) if one considers only one diagram , and therefore the @xmath99 coefficients can be factorized as @xmath130 , where @xmath131 contains all the structure of propagators and @xmath132 are real for @xmath103 and purely imaginary for @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross2 ] ) we have @xmath134 with @xmath135 being real . on the other hand , if we have two diagrams then the @xmath131 coefficient can be different for some terms of the amplitude and the @xmath136 factorization does not hold . in conclusion ,",
    "associating mechanisms to diagrams , only the mechanisms that have two possible diagrams associated , i.e. , those of type - i , could by themselves be nonzero ( although some of them can also be zero ) .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that one needs @xmath137 implies the coefficients @xmath99 to be generally complex , and this is provided by the propagator structure of the diagrams .",
    "this is the reason why this observable is so sensitive to the internal mechanisms of the reaction . in addition , the fact that the @xmath96 factor of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross2 ] ) makes the numerator of @xmath67 to be proportional to @xmath138 implies that the difference from a simple @xmath138 dependence comes from the momentum dependence of the @xmath99 coefficients of the amplitude .",
    "thus , the angular dependence of the helicity asymmetry is strongly reflecting the internal structure of the various mechanisms .",
    "on the other hand , when allowing the different mechanisms to interfere between them , even if some individual mechanisms do not produce an asymmetry by themselves , they can produce a non - vanishing asymmetry when adding them coherently .",
    "this is why the interferences in the @xmath62 dependence of the helicity asymmetry are so important .",
    "the angular dependence of the denominator of the helicity asymmetry , @xmath139 ( which is proportional to the total cross section ) , does not modify qualitatively the previous discussion .",
    "let us illustrate the previous discussion with an example : let us consider the @xmath30kr term ( @xmath113 mechanism of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] ) . the amplitude for the process where the @xmath115 is emitted before the @xmath116",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath140,\\ ] ] where @xmath141 , @xmath142 is the @xmath143 propagator and @xmath144 is a form factor . for the process where the @xmath116 is emitted before the @xmath115 the amplitude",
    "is obtained by exchanging @xmath145 and writing the appropriate isospin coefficients @xmath146.\\ ] ]    with these expressions for the amplitude , we have for the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross ] ) @xmath147 with @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "this means that the @xmath30kr mechanism ( accounting for two feynman diagrams ) gives by itself a non - vanishing angular dependence of the helicity asymmetry thanks to the imaginary part in the @xmath30 propagator , and deviation from a simple @xmath138 dependence ( as will be shown in the results section ) is due to the momentum dependence of the propagator and the form factor , ( although this latter one is a smooth function ) .",
    "the kind of reasoning presented in this section stresses the importance of small details of the theoretical models , making the @xmath62 dependence of the helicity asymmetry a very useful and powerful tool to check the heart of the theoretical models .",
    "therefore , even if the model succeeds to reproduce unpolarized observables ( like total cross sections , invariant mass distributions , etc ) , it could fail to reproduce the kind of polarization observables studied in this work , simply because of small details .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : results1 ] we show , for a given @xmath150 energy of @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) , the @xmath62 distribution of the helicity asymmetry , @xmath67 , for different mechanisms contributing to the @xmath11 process . from left to right and up to down the plots represent : @xmath30kr term ( @xmath113 diagram of fig .

    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : results1 ] the very strong dependence on the mechanisms considered and the crucial role of the interferences . for instance , even if the nucleon intermediate mechanisms give a vanishing contribution by themselves , the interference with the @xmath143 mechanisms produces strong changes in the distribution with respect to considering the @xmath143 terms alone . from the discussion of the previous section",
    "it can be understood why the nucleon mechanisms give a zero assymetry : the nucleon propagators do not have width and therefore do not have a complex structure needed to produce a non - zero imaginary part in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross2 ] ) .",
    "another quantitative example of the important role of the interferences can be seen , for instance , by looking at the figures evaluated with all the mechanisms except the nucleons or except de @xmath30kr term . for this latter case , despite the asymmetry for the @xmath30kr being very small , it has an important influence in the full result . on the other hand , by comparing the `` all except nucleon '' with the `` all '' plot , one can see the dramatic influence of the nucleon intermediate mechanism in the angular distribution of the helicity asymmetry , despite these mechanisms contributing only around @xmath158% to the total cross section .    in order to show the sensitivity to the energy of the angular distribution of the helicity asymmetry",

    "the experimental data , still preliminary , are obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite , measured with the clas detector at jefferson lab .",
    "it is important to stress that these data are integrated over the full clas acceptance , while the theoretical model covers the full phase space .",
    "thus , given the sensitivity of the observable to these details , one has to be cautious when making conclusions from this naive comparison . with this caveat , and after the remarks on the sensitivity of this observable to small details of the model , the comparison of the theoretical predictions of the present work and the data of @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results2 ] would be seen as an indication that the model contains the basic mechanisms .",

    "the discrepancies found in the shape for the two lower energies are more worrisome , but in view of the preliminary character of the experimental data , and the fact that they are not @xmath159 integrated , it is probably too early to draw conclusions from there .",
    "we would like to note that the theoretical results reported here are similar in strength and shape as those reported in @xcite as private communication , calculated with the model of @xcite . in view of this , it is important that definitive data are provided and that direct calculations adapted to the acceptance of the experimental setup are carried out .",
    "this comparison should help in the future to improve the present models of double pion photoproduction .",
    "we are aware , that given the important role of the sources of complex part in the amplitudes in this polarized observable , other sources of complex part not considered in our model could be relevant for the polarization observables in spite that they could be not so important in the unpolarized observables .",
    "for instance , in ref .  @xcite it was pointed out , as private communication from mokeev , that complex relative phases in the amplitudes could produce sizeable effects in these polarization observables , whereas in unpolarized observable they do not .",
    "on the other hand , final state interaction of the produced particles could also influence these observables .",
    "therefore , we are well aware of the limitations of our model , but the present work can serve to establish , from the comparison with experiments , how much room for improvement one can expect on the theoretical models . + next",
    "we show the results for the @xmath12 channel , for which there are prospects to be measured at mainz @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ fig : results3 ] and [ fig : results4 ] we show the contribution of different mechanisms , or combinations between them , for two different energies .    in the @xmath16 channel",

    "this happens since the two @xmath161 are identical particles and the observables can not depend on permuting the two @xmath161 , but the exchange of the two pions means the change @xmath162 ( see fig .

    "[ fig : results3 ] and [ fig : results4 ] manifesting mainly a @xmath164 dependence , one can see there the important role of interferences in determining the strength and phase ( sign ) of the distributions , and the energy dependence of the effect .",
    "for instance , for @xmath166 , despite the nucleon mechanisms giving a vanishing contribution by themselves ( not shown in the figure ) , the interference with the @xmath143 mechanisms produces a very small asymmetry .",
    "another example , quite spectacular , is the role of the @xmath21 diagram since , in spite that by itself gives a similar distribution for both energies , the distribution removing it from the full model looks dramatically different in the two energies : in fact , at @xmath167 , the angular distribution of the asymmetry is negligible if one removes the @xmath21 mechanism from the full model , while at @xmath168 the effect is very large .",
    "the @xmath155 reduces the strength at @xmath168 if it is removed from the full model , while no significant effect is visible at @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , in spite the @xmath16 channel having less richness in different shapes for the distribution , the large variation in the strength and sign stresses the importance of this observable in elucidating the mechanisms involved in the reaction .",
    "+ the calculations done in the present work are just an example of the type of studies that one can make , in the sense that other energies , angles or kinematical cuts can be implemented , but it serves as an example of the strong dependence on the internal mechanisms and interferences that is obtained from this kind of polarization experiments .",
    "we have made calculations of angular distributions of helicity asymmetries in @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the interaction of circularly polarized photons with unpolarized protons .",
    "we have used a well tested theoretical model successfully applied in the evaluation of several unpolarized observables .",
    "the study of polarization observables of the kind of those discussed in the present work , can serve to challenge the theoretical models when more demanding refinement of the details can be crucial .",
    "we have shown the strong dependence of the shape and strength of the calculations on the internal mechanisms and interferences among different contributions to the process .",
    "we have shown that , in spite that some mechanisms do not give structure by themselves , they can be crucial to produce the final result due to subtle interferences with other mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , mechanisms which give a small contribution in unpolarized observables , like total cross sections , can be of strong relevance in the contribution to the difference between the polarization cross sections .",
    "therefore , these polarization observables have different sensitivities to the internal details of the model than other observables .",
    "further experimental results would be of importance to discriminate between models but being aware that sizeable discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results can be due to small details which are irrelevant when applying the model to the evaluation of unpolarized observables .",

    "<S> based on a prior model on double pion photoproduction on the proton , successfully tested in total cross sections and invariant mass distributions , we make a theoretical study of the angular dependence of helicity asymmetries from the interaction of circularly polarized photons with unpolarized protons . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this observable is sensitive to details of the internal mechanisms and , thus , represents a complementary test of the theoretical model . </S>"
