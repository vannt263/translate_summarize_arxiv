    "molecular clouds ( mcs ) in the galaxy exhibit a wealth of structures in ( column ) densities , velocities and magnetic fields .",
    "the observed structural properties strongly suggest that mcs are highly dynamical objects within a turbulent interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "especially , the observed non - thermal linewidths ( @xcite ; @xcite ) indicate the turbulent nature of the clouds .",
    "the importance of molecular cloud turbulence for the process of star formation has been the subject of many investigations ( see @xcite and @xcite for overviews ) .",
    "turbulent mixing is an ever - recurring theme in the ism .",
    "classical turbulent mixing accelerates diffusive transport by a factor on the order of the reynolds number of the flow ( e.g. @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite discussed the applicability of turbulent transport and mixing to a turbulent ism , stating that transport rates can vary strongly with time , sometimes exhibiting super - diffusive behaviour due to bulk motions of the gas .",
    "turbulent mixing has also been held responsible as a source of the highly ionized gas observed around high velocity clouds in the galactic halo ( e.g. @xcite ) , although it is unclear whether turbulent mixing or evaporation by heat conduction is the dominating process @xcite    a spherical cold cloud travelling through a warm uniform medium dissolves approximately within a timescale @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the cloud s initial mass , @xmath3 its density , @xmath4 its radius , and @xmath5 its velocity @xcite .",
    "the main agent is the kelvin - helmholtz - instability , whose efficiency in dissolving the cloud depends on the cloud s physical properties , e.g whether it is self - gravitating @xcite  in which case there exists a critical mass above which the cloud remains stable  , or whether it suffers radiative energy losses @xcite  in which case the instability can be damped , stabilizing the cloud .",
    "cloud dispersal by hydrodynamical instabilities might be of considerable importance : observations and theoretical considerations suggest that molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood have lifetimes of approximately @xmath6 to @xmath7 myrs , which would necessitate close to instantaneous star formation once the clouds have formed ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while stellar feedback in the form of supernovae could disrupt a cloud , low - mass stars in solar neighborhood clouds might not be efficient enough to achieve such a rapid dispersal ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative route has been offered by interpreting molecular clouds as transient objects generated by large - scale colliding flows ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this picture",
    ", the flows in which the clouds form eventually might lead to their dispersal within a few myrs .",
    "we investigate the role of turbulence for the overall evolution of a cold cloud  corresponding to the cold neutral medium ( cnm )  embedded in warm gas whose parameters are representative of the warm ionized medium ( wim ) .",
    "specifically , we are interested in the timescales on which a cold solid cloud will disperse in a turbulent environment , and in the evolution of the radiation field within the cloud (  [ s : physics ] ) .",
    "a detailed , time - independent study of the radiation field in a filamentary cloud can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we find (  [ s : results ] ) that the warm and cold components are efficiently mixed by bodily transport .",
    "however , the central optical depth stays comfortably above @xmath8 even for late times . at first",
    ", this might seem contradictory , however , the local radiation field within the cloud increases by several orders of magnitude within a couple of dynamical times .",
    "turbulent diffusivities derived from the expansion of the cold cloud generally are not constant with time .",
    "possible consequences for cloud lifetimes and evolution are discussed in  [ s : summary ] .",
    "we start with a uniform sphere of cold dense gas in a warm diffuse ambient medium .",
    "the system is initially completely in thermal and almost in turbulent pressure equilibrium .",
    "one model set ( sequence a ) is purely adiabatic , i.e. the two - phase structure of the system will get erased with time as gas with temperature intermediate to the two initial temperatures is created .",
    "the second set ( sequence c ) keeps the identities of the warm and cold phases distinct by a combination of heating and cooling processes @xcite typical for the warm and cold atomic ism .",
    "thus , we study turbulent mixing under conditions with and without radiative losses .",
    "initially , both gas components are in thermal equilibrium at temperatures that for the radiative case correspond to the two stable temperature regimes , i.e. there is no gas in the thermally unstable regime initially .",
    "the lower initial temperature is set to @xmath9k , and the density contrast between warm and cold gas is @xmath10 , with @xmath11@xmath12 in the warm phase at @xmath13k .",
    "the cubic box is periodic in all directions , with a side length , @xmath14 , of @xmath15pc , and the cold gas sphere starts out with a radius of @xmath16pc .    instead of studying the cloud evolution within a shear flow , we resort to a more direct way of treating turbulence , namely by initially imposing a velocity field drawn from a random gaussian distribution ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "power is alotted in fourier space only to the largest scales , and with random phases .",
    "this is meant to mimic the effect of turbulence generated by an unspecified source on larger scales .",
    "the initial mach number in the warm gas @xmath17 or @xmath7  corresponding to @xmath18 km s@xmath19 and @xmath20 km s@xmath19  is higher than mach numbers commonly ascribed to the warm ism , however , since the turbulence is not driven , the system acquires reasonable values of @xmath21 once turbulence is fully developed .",
    "the justification for this will be discussed in  [ ss : turbdiss ] .",
    "one might argue that the scenario of a uniform , spherical cold cloud evolving in a decaying turbulent velocity field is only of limited physical relevance , since the galactic ism turbulence is to a large extent thought to be driven by supernovae @xcite .",
    "however , the goal of this study is not to model the evolution of a cold ( possibly molecular ) cloud , but to demonstrate that even under unfavorable conditions ( decaying turbulence , no stellar feedback , no gravitational fragmentation , starting with a uniform spherical cloud ) , cold clouds fragment and disperse sufficiently within a dynamical timescale so that the internal structure of the cloud is thoroughly altered . driven turbulence and/or stellar feedback obviously would lead to faster dispersal , while gravitational fragmentation would result in a smaller gas filling factor , thus opening holes and channels for radiation and energy ( possibly in form of waves , see e.g. @xcite ) to enter the cloud . for this reason also a non - uniform cloud would be more prone to disperse in a turbulent environment .    the adiabatic model sequqence we will denote by a , the radiatively cooled model by c. the initial mach number of the model is denoted by `` 2 '' or `` 3 '' , for mach @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "we ran models at linear resolutions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 cells , indicated by the letters @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the choice of the  rather small  initial cloud radius could raise concerns about how well even the @xmath23-models are resolved .",
    "thus , we ran an additional model , a2l , with the same parameters as the adiabatic model at mach @xmath6 , a2b , except for the initial cloud radius , here set to @xmath26pc .    initially , the system is in thermal and near turbulent pressure balance , i.e for turbulent pressure balance @xmath27 holds , with velocities @xmath5 and densities @xmath3 .",
    "the indices stand for the cold and warm phase .",
    "the near pressure balance reduces motions due to pressure differences and therefore allows us to make more valid statements about turbulent transport or mixing in this idealized setup .",
    "the numerical scheme is based on the 2nd order bhatnagar - gross - krook formalism ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , allowing control of viscosity and heat conduction .",
    "the code evolves the navier - stokes equations in their conservative form to second order in time and space .",
    "the hydrodynamical quantities are updated in time unsplit form .",
    "we employed the same heating and cooling prescriptions as @xcite , based on @xcite .",
    "the same caveats apply , especially that we are discussing the mixing between the warm and cold ism , and that we are not including molecular gas .",
    "thus , while the parameters of our cold cloud are consistent with values for `` giant molecular clouds '' , we neglect the effects of molecular line cooling and chemistry .    the code is equipped with lagrangian tracer particles that are initially deployed within the cold cloud at a resolution of one particle per grid cell .",
    "the particles are advected with the gas flow , so that they allow us to study the history of the cold gas .",
    "we restricted the models to hydrodynamics with heating and cooling , leaving out gravity and magnetic fields .",
    "depending on their strength , fields could suppress shear instabilities , while gravity might lead to more compact dense structures and fragmentation .",
    "this could have a twofold effect , as will be discussed in ",
    "[ s : summary ] .",
    "a first impression of the efficiency of turbulent mixing can be gleaned from a time sequence of column density maps ( fig .  [",
    "f : morphall ] ) .",

    "turbulent dispersal is clearly visible .",
    "the most noticeable difference between the adiabatic models a2b and a2l ( top and bottom ) on the one hand and the radiative models ( c2b , center ) on the other is that for the latter , the transition between low and high column densities is much more marked , i.e. the column density maps appear ( especially in the later stages ) less `` frothy '' . as we will see below ,",

    "color corresponds to @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "[ f : morphall ] ]    in overall appearance , for both the adiabatic and radiative models the cloud stays more or less compact , although fingers of cold , dense material are clearly sprouting from the core .",
    "since we will be discussing the turbulent mixing of the warm and cold gas , first , we need to understand the dynamics and evolution of each of the phases .",
    "note that  strictly speaking  the concept of `` phases '' can be misleading not only for the adiabatic case , but also for the thermally bistable case , because of the importance of dynamics ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by the bistable models ( sequence c ) , we split the model - ism into three regimes , namely a cold phase with temperatures @xmath37 , a warm phase ( @xmath38 ) and an intermediate phase with @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding mass fractions ( fig .",
    "[ f : bulkmeas ] , top panel ) evolve quite differently for adiabatic and radiative models .",
    "the mass fractions are taken over the whole simulation volume . since the cloud in model a2l has an initial radius twice as large as in the other models , it starts off with a larger cold mass fraction and a smaller warm mass fraction .",
    "the intermediate temperature regime evolves similarly to that in models a2a / b .    in the adiabatic case ( a2a / b / l ) , some of the cold gas is lost to the intermediate regime , while the mass fraction in the warm phase stays pretty much constant .",
    "in contrast , the radiative case ( c2a / b ) keeps constant mass fractions in each of the three temperature regimes over the whole simulation time ( i.e. @xmath40 dynamical times ) .",
    "heating and cooling timescales are much shorter than the dynamical timescales , so that gas can not collect in the intermediate regime , which for model c2a / b corresponds to the thermally unstable regime . in particular , in c2a",
    "/ b gas which is heated by ( viscous ) shear at the cloud boundaries `` falls back '' to its previous ( cold ) thermal state , while for a2a / b , this gas has no way to return to its previous temperature except by adiabatic cooling .",
    "varying the resolution does not change the mass fractions appreciably .",
    "model c2a / b displays a tiny increase of the cold mass fraction .",
    "this stems from the compression of warm gas when it collides with the cold cloud rim . once the warm gas density increases , cooling sets in , and this compressed gas is added to the cold gas component .",
    "however , as figure  [ f : bulkmeas ] shows , this effect is negligible .     and @xmath41 , and for model a2l ( at @xmath41 ) .",
    "_ bottom : _ rms velocity @xmath42 for cold and warm gas against time , for the same models and resolutions .",
    "note that red and blue lines here denote @xmath43k and @xmath44k respectively .",
    "[ f : bulkmeas ] ]    in contrast to the evolution of the mass fractions differing for the adiabatic and radiative models , the rms velocities of the gas in the cold and warm temperature regimes evolve similarly for both sets of models .",
    "figure  [ f : bulkmeas ] ( bottom panel ) mirrors the initial pressure balance ( eq .  [ e : initpress ] ) : velocities in the cold phase start out lower by a factor of approximately @xmath45 . for each of the models a and c , the velocities in the cold and warm phase decay , albeit at different rates .",
    "resolution effects do not affect the decay ( the thin and thick lines are nearly indistinguishable ) . comparing model a to c , the radiative losses occurring in c do not lead to significantly different decay rates .",
    "radiative losses would become important in regions of high compression , however , the turbulence initially decays quickly below mach @xmath8 in both the warm and cold gas , limiting the compression .",
    "we discuss the time evolution of the cold and warm pressure profiles in detail in  [ ss : radprof ] .",
    "the larger cloud ( model a2l ) shows the same velocity decay as its small counterparts .",
    "does the cloud break up in the turbulent environment , and if so , how quickly does this happen ?",
    "the answer depends strongly on the quantity we are looking at .",
    "since we are interested in an average measure of the cloud s structure , we take averages over shells and discuss the resulting radial profiles .",
    "the shell centers coincide with the instantaneous center of mass of the cloud ( the cloud itself moves a little in the background flow ) .",
    "we begin with the density profiles ( fig .",
    "[ f : rhorad ] ) .",
    "bottom : _ relative standard deviation of density profile ( eq .  [ e : relstddev ] ) .",
    "the dotted vertical line denotes the initial radius .",
    "[ f : rhorad ] ]    clearly , the turbulent motions lead to a spreading - out of the cloud , mirrored in the density - weighted average radius @xmath46 of the cloud , which roughly doubles within @xmath47myrs . as figure",
    "[ f : morphall ] already indicates , the radial density profiles show a substantial variation at fixed radius @xmath48 ( fig  [ f : rhorad ] , lower panel ) , up to six times the actual density value .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 plotted is the relative standard deviation on the mean density over a sphere at radius @xmath48 .",
    "the strongest variations are expected at the cloud rim , which travels ( upper panel ) outwards , so that the peak of the density variations is seen at larger radii for later times .",
    "already after one dynamical time , the cloud is far from being a solid sphere .",
    "a more stringent measure is the radial volume filling factor profile for gas in the cold phase ( fig .",
    "[ f : filfacrad ] ) .",
    "volume filling factors are measured on shells at given @xmath48 . as in  [ ss : dynphas ] , the temperature threshold to distinguish between the warm and cold phase is set at @xmath50k .",
    "the step function in the upper panel gives the initial condition , which of course shows a cold gas filling factor of @xmath8 for @xmath51  pc ( or @xmath52  pc for model a2l ) .",
    "the first obvious difference between the radiative and adiabatic case is that the adiabatic case seems to mix faster the cold and warm phase at more radii .",
    "however , this is not that surprising , since for the adiabatic case _ any _ gas with @xmath43k is lost for the cold gas filling factor , while for the radiative case , gas which has left the cold phase can only be found in the warm phase ( there is no intermediate - phase gas , fig .  [",
    "f : bulkmeas ] , top panel ) but because of the short cooling times , this gas can quickly return to the cold phase . in other words the filling factor gives an unambiguous measure of the degree of mixing between cold and warm gas only for the thermally bistable , radiative case ( c2b ) , since there is ( close to ) zero conversion between the gas phases ( see also discussion on tracer particles below ) .",
    "after @xmath6 myrs ( corresponding to @xmath29 ) , the volume filling factor of the cold gas measures @xmath53% for the radiative case , and @xmath54% for the adiabatic case at the initial cloud boundary , i.e. more than half of the volume is occupied by warm gas . note that especially in the radiative case , the _ mass fractions _ of cold and warm gas stay constant , i.e. cold and warm gas are bodily transported .",
    "this can be gleaned from figure  [ f : temphist ] .",
    "it shows the histogram of the fraction of lagrangian tracer particles @xmath55 within the cloud that stay at temperatures @xmath44k for a time interval @xmath56 .",
    "if there were no turbulence in the models , all the particles would stay at @xmath44k for the whole duration of the simulation , i.e. we would have @xmath57 at @xmath58 .",
    "most of the particles stay cold for longer than @xmath59myr , i.e. for the simulation s time extent . in other words ,",
    "the constancy of the mass fractions in figure  [ f : bulkmeas ] indeed results only to a very minor extent from the conversion of cold to warm gas and vice versa : mass in the cold and warm regime is separately conserved .",
    "this is less valid for the adiabatic case , which obviously loses some of its cold material .",
    "but still , the bulk of the initially cold gas stays cold for the whole simulation time .",
    "_ bottom : _ relative standard deviation of filling factor profile ( analogous to eq .",

    "most tracer particles stay cold over the whole simulation time ( @xmath60myr ) for model c2b ( thick line ) , while for model a2b ( thin line ) , only @xmath61% of the particles stay at @xmath44k .",
    "[ f : temphist ] ]    besides turbulent transport , an overpressure in the cold cloud could lead to `` expansion '' .",
    "so far , our diagnostics can not distinguish between these two mechanisms for cloud expansion .",
    "figure  [ f : radpress ] shows the radial profiles of the pressures for models a2b , c2b and a2l .",
    "the total pressure @xmath62 has been split into the thermal pressure @xmath63 , and the turbulent pressure @xmath64 , from which we have removed the contribution of the translational velocity @xmath65 , as @xmath66 where the average extends over coherent cold and warm regions .",
    "the top row gives the radial pressure profile for gas with @xmath43k , and the bottom row shows the profile for gas with @xmath44k .",
    "the time sequence reveals the mixing of the warm and cold component , since @xmath67 can be defined at smaller radii for later times , while @xmath68 spreads outward to large radii resulting in warm and cold gas co - existing at an increasingly larger radial range . for @xmath69 ,",
    "models a2b and c2b are of course identical .",
    "the thermal pressure is constant , while the turbulent pressure ( and thus the total pressure ) is slightly lower within the cold cloud than in the warm medium .",
    "this serves as a safeguard against initially overpressuring the cloud by turbulent pressure . at @xmath29 ( center column ) , the cold dense material ( i.e. the cloud ) in both models",
    "is overpressured relative to the warm gas .",
    "this comes mostly from an overshoot in the density , since turbulent pressure and thermal pressure have ( approximately ) the same radial dependence : the cloud is initially slightly compressed by the higher turbulence in the warm medium ( see also the radial density profiles , fig .",
    "[ f : rhorad ] ) . in figure",
    "[ f : bulkmeas ] ( bottom panel ) we saw that the rms velocity  and because of the close to constant density in the respective phases , the kinetic energy  decays faster for the warm gas than for the cold gas .",
    "both effects together lead to the overpressure in the cold gas at @xmath29 . at later times , this pressure imbalance has canceled out , and the warm and cold phases are mixed . there is still a turbulent pressure excess at small radii , however , the turbulence has decayed so far that its dynamical effects are insignificant .    ,",

    "the three columns per model denote the measurement times @xmath69 , @xmath29 and @xmath31 . [",
    "f : radpress ] ]    for the adiabatic run , at @xmath29 the thermal pressure has risen from its initial value both for the cold and warm gas . the turbulent pressure on the other hand , has dropped by about a factor @xmath7 for the warm gas , but not as much for the cold gas , suggesting that turbulent energy in the warm phase has been used to heat the warm phase and to drive the turbulence in the cold phase , since the thermal energy in the cold phase increased and the turbulent energy remains unchanged .",
    "with the total energy conserved , some of the energy in the cold gas has to come from the warm gas . for the radiative model at @xmath71 the transfer of energy from the warm to the cold gas",
    "is less marked but seems to have occurred nevertheless .",
    "the cold gas thermal and turbulent pressure in the innermost radii increase from their initial values .",
    "the thermal pressure of the warm gas on the other hand has hardly changed from its initial value even though the turbulent pressure has dropped by almost an order of magnitude from its initial value at all radii where warm gas exists .",
    "again , the thermal and/or turbulent pressure increase in the cold gas has to come from the warm gas .",
    "model a2l shows essentially the same behavior as model a2b .",
    "the radial density profile allows us to determine the average optical depth at a given radius ( fig .",
    "[ f : optdeprad ] ) .",
    "to arrive at meaningful optical depths , we scaled the effective absorption coefficient @xmath72 such that the central optical depth is initially arbitrarily set to @xmath73 for models a2a / b and c2a / b , and to @xmath74 for model a2l .",
    "this corresponds to an absorption coefficient of @xmath75 @xmath76 . for comparison , spitzer ( 1961 )",
    "gives an effective combined cross section for absorption and scattering on grains of @xmath77 @xmath76 at a wavelength of @xmath78 nm .",

    "[ f : optdeprad ] ]    there are no marked differences between the adiabatic and the radiative case .",
    "this as well as the fact that @xmath79 does not change appreciably over time is a direct consequence of the radial density profiles ( fig .",

    "the central optical depth @xmath80 drops by approximately a factor of @xmath6 , but does not fall below @xmath81 .",
    "that @xmath80 changes at all with time might come as a surprise , but is a consequence of the exchange of dense and diffuse material at approximate pressure equilibrium : the filling factor of dense material on a spherical surface at fixed radius decreases , lowering the central optical depth .      the evolving radial density and filling factor profiles ( figs .",
    "[ f : rhorad ] and [ f : filfacrad ] ) suggest to estimate the ( turbulent ) diffusivity by fitting them to the expected profiles resulting from the time evolution of a step function under the effect of diffusion .",

    "quasi - linear diffusion theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) holds that @xmath91 can be regarded as constant .",

    "clearly , the filling factor profiles lead to much better fits than the density profiles . figures  [ f : rhorad ] and [ f : filfacrad ] explain this : the filling factor can not rise above @xmath8 or drop below @xmath106 , thus constraining the profiles for the least - square minimization , while the density profiles actually increase above @xmath107 and drop below @xmath108 because of traveling waves .",
    "moreover , in deriving equation  [ e : diffdens ] , we assumed that @xmath109 is valid for all @xmath110 , and not only for @xmath111 , as by construction of the initial conditions .",

    "the density profiles do not provide as nearly a complete picture as the filling factor profiles .",
    "reliable fits are difficult to get because of shock waves traveling through the cloud . the few reliable fits clearly show that the diffusivities are not constant , but range within the same values as the ones derived from the filling factor profiles . as a crude check , the classically expected diffusivities @xmath113",
    "are shown in the top right panel of figure  [ f : difftime ] in lines .",

    "this allowed them to study the radiation field inside an evolved structured cloud . here , we are interested in the timescales on which the radiation field changes .    to get a measure of the brightness inside the cloud ,",
    "we determine the intensity of the radiation field at each point inside the cloud ( see @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ f : irrscatt ] shows a scatter plot of the intensities inside the volume occupied by the original cloud against radius , for the four times indicated .    ]",
    "the brightness is calculated for each point by measuring the incident radiation for a given number of rays and averaging over the resulting sky .",
    "the ray number is determined such that at the outer surface of the cloud each resolution element is hit by one ray .",
    "note that while we plot only points up to the original radius of the cloud , the radiative transfer includes the whole domain , i.e. we do not lose `` dense '' material outside @xmath115pc which could shadow the inner parts . for extinction",
    ", we consider an effective extinction coefficient .",
    "actual scattering is not included . in that sense",
    "our brightness estimates are lower limits .",
    "the radially binned intensities resulting from plots like figure  [ f : irrscatt ] for models a2b , c2b and a2l are shown in figure  [ f : intensities ] .",
    "thick lines denote spherical volume averages at constant @xmath48 , and thin lines spherical mass averages .",
    "without self - gravity , the density contrasts in the cold material are small , so that volume and mass averages do not differ widely .",
    "clearly , figure  [ f : intensities ] mirrors the effect observed in figure  [ f : irrscatt ] : the cloud gets `` bright '' within a few dynamical times , i.e. the turbulence opens holes . even for the larger cloud ( a2l )",
    ", the relative intensity does not drop below @xmath116 anywhere in the cloud .        at late times , even the innermost regions receive more than a tenth of the incident radiation ( models a2a / b , c2a / b , fig .",
    "[ f : centertime ] ) : turbulence ( indirectly ) lights up the cloud .",
    "the intensity at the center of the cloud increases by at least @xmath6 orders of magnitude .",
    "the central intensity for the models at lower resolution ( thin lines , a2a and c2a ) grows more smoothly than the intensity at higher resolution , and it reaches a slightly higher value at the end of the simulation .",
    "these are both resolution effects : the larger scatter comes from a more structured velocity field , and the larger central intensity is a consequence of fewer available grid cells along the line of sight .",
    "still , for model a2l  with its initial cloud radius twice the size of those in models a2a / b  , the central intensity increases by four orders of magnitude ( compared to two for models a2a / b and c2a / b ) .",
    "thus , we do not expect higher resolution to lead to progressively smaller central intensities .    ]",
    "the central intensities discussed so far are derived from averaging the incoming radiation over the whole `` sky '' as seen from the cloud center .",
    "if the turbulence digs tunnels in the cloud through which the irradiation can enter deep into the cloud , then this should be mirrored in the minimum ( and maximum ) optical depth at the center of the cloud ( fig .",
    "[ f : optdep ] ) .",
    "the extrema of the optical depths were taken over the whole sky as seen at the center of the cloud .",
    "the mean optical depth corresponds to the center intensities discussed above ( note however that in order to derive the center intensities , the _ intensities _ are averaged over the sky , not the optical depths ) .        as with the intensities ( fig .",
    "[ f : centertime ] ) , the lower resolution runs lead to smaller average optical depths ( fig .",
    "[ f : optdep ] , top right ) .",
    "this is mostly a consequence of the lower minimum optical depths ( top left of same figure ) and of the dominance of large - scale motions .",
    "thus , the models run at @xmath22 grid cells are not fully resolved , but should be used for demonstration purposes only .",
    "the strong spike for model c2b is a direct effect of the radiative cooling : compressed regions during the early turbulent evolution can reach much higher densities than possible for the adiabatic case . although the minimum and maximum optical depth starts out at the same value , the maximum optical depth increases due to local compressions .",
    "of course , the directions of minimum and maximum optical depth change with time . models with different initial mach number vary less than those with same mach number but run at different resolution . since the turbulence in our models is decaying ,",
    "this is not surprising : most of the energy is lost in the early stages of the evolution .    summarizing figure  [ f : optdep ] , the minimum optical depths drop by a factor of @xmath117 to @xmath118 ( depending on the model ) , while the maximum optical depths increase by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , while most of the brightening of the cloud stems from turbulent transport of dense material ( see  [ ss : dynphas ] and [ ss : radprof ] ) , compression and corresponding evacuation contributes as well .",
    "finally , the average optical depths drop by a factor of @xmath117 or more .",
    "motivated by the highly dynamical nature of molecular clouds and the question of how long a cold cloud can survive as a well - defined entity in a turbulent environment , we investigated the evolution of a cold cloud in a warm , turbulent medium , assessing the efficiency of the mixing by measuring the brightness inside the cloud .",
    "we showed that the properties of the initially solid cloud change thoroughly within a few dynamical timescales .",
    "while the column density maps can mislead , the brightness distribution inside the cloud clearly demonstrates that within a few dynamical times , the cloud becomes completely porous . specifically , the cloud radius doubles within @xmath40 dynamical times , while the filling factor of the cold gas drops to less than @xmath0% at the original cloud radius within one dynamical time .",
    "cold material is bodily transported and exchanged with warm material ( figs .",
    "[ f : bulkmeas ] and [ f : temphist ] ) .",
    "the turbulent diffusivity @xmath91 ( eq .  [",
    "[ e : diffdens ] ] , [ [ e : diffrms ] ] and fig .",
    "[ f : difftime ] ) is consistent with a fiducial number of @xmath119 @xmath76 s@xmath120 , corresponding to turbulent velocities and length scales of approximately @xmath8 km s@xmath19 and @xmath8 pc .",
    "the diffusivities are not constant with time .    the brightness estimates are lower limits , since we do not include scattering in the radiative transfer .",
    "gravity might change the results by leading to additional fragmentation and thus to a growing discrepancy between volume - weighted and mass - weighted intensity @xcite .",
    "however , volumewise , the cloud would get even brighter this way due to the smaller filling factor of the dense gas .",
    "the effects of h@xmath121 ( re-)formation remain to be discussed in subsequent models . if the turbulence were continually driven , we would expect an even faster dispersal . in that sense also , the presented timescales are only upper limits",
    ".    the high radiation field within the cloud could strongly affect the chemistry and the dynamical state of the cloud @xcite , leading to additional heating , h@xmath121-destruction , and thus faster cloud disruption .",
    "we thank the referee for a critical , very detailed and constructive report which helped in reducing the number of faults and flaws in the manuscript . the idea for the present study arose during the iau symposium 227 , `` massive star birth : a crossroads of astrophysics '' .",
    "we enjoyed discussions with c.  f.  mckee about molecular cloud lifetimes and turbulent dispersal , with k.  menten about small - scale structure in molecular clouds , and with e.  zweibel about turbulent transport .",
    "computations were performed at the ncsa ( ast040026 ) , and on the sgi - altix at the usm , built and maintained by m.  wetzstein and r.  gabler .",
    "f.h . enjoyed the hospitality of cral both at the ens lyon and the observatoire de lyon during several visits .",
