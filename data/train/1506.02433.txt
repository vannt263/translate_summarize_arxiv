    "in recent years , several experiments under well - controlled laboratory conditions were carried out to explore pedestrian characteristics in bottlenecks .",
    "most experiments focused on the relationship between bottleneck width and pedestrian flow @xcite .",
    "the flow was once announced to grow in a stepwise manner along with lane formation @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown afterwards by more detailed experiments to be linearly dependent on bottleneck width .",
    "the slope of the linear function is approximately 1.9 ( m@xmath0s)@xmath1 with bottleneck width ranging from 0.7 m to 5.0 m @xcite . when bottleneck width is smaller than 0.7 m , the slope of the linear function decreases with increasing bottleneck width @xcite .",
    "other bottleneck geometrical factors were also studied .",
    "shorter bottlenecks provide higher flow than longer ones @xcite .",
    "wider width of the passage in front of bottleneck leads to higher flow @xcite .",
    "the flow also increases with increasing distance between bottleneck and holding area @xcite .",
    "usually bottleneck geometry was made up of boards higher than 2.0 m to prevent pedestrians bodies overlapping the boundaries . but nagai et al .",
    "@xcite used desks with the height of approximately 0.8 m , which was pointed out to actually provide wider bottleneck widths @xcite . helbing et al .",
    "@xcite and yanagisawa et al .",
    "@xcite studied the influence of an obstacle in front of the bottleneck , and found that the existence of the obstacle leads to higher flow especially when shifted from the center .",
    "furthermore , the influences of non - geometrical factors were studied .",
    "nagai et al .",
    "@xcite changed the initial density of the participants in the holding area , and found that the flow increases with increasing initial density but the rate of the increase decreases .",
    "daamen et al .",
    "@xcite changed the composition of the participants , and found that the experiment with mainly children has the highest flow and that with disabled pedestrians has lower flow .",
    "most experiments were conducted under normal situations , in which the participants were asked to walk through the bottleneck with normal speed .",
    "only a few experiments were conducted under competitive @xcite , hurried @xcite , pushing @xcite or stressful @xcite situations .",
    "unfortunately , no coincident result is made considering the influence of different situations .",
    "it is worth noting that pedestrian movement includes transient state and steady state . in pedestrian dynamics experiments ,",
    "transient state depends strongly on initial conditions while steady state is a good indicator of the independency of initial conditions , especially when the duration of experiments is short .",
    "thus steady state is a distinguished significance for the interpretation of the results , and transient state should be excluded when combining different experiments to get universal conclusions .",
    "however , few research about bottleneck experiments considered the difference between transient state and steady state .",
    "cepolina @xcite showed the time series of pedestrian flow .",
    "the flow changes significantly in transient state which is at the beginning and at the end , but keeps constant in steady state .",
    "yet she did not further analyse the flow in steady state .",
    "seyfried et al .",
    "@xcite used regression analysis to calculate the stationary values for the density and speed , but the flow in steady state was not considered .",
    "rupprecht et al .",
    "@xcite found that the flows with all participants and with specified participants have different trends , but the specified participants were selected arbitrarily not considering steady state .",
    "liao et al .",
    "@xcite compared the flows in all states and in steady state , and found that they are both linearly dependent on bottleneck width but with different slopes .",
    "nevertheless , the duration of steady state was determined according to `` small fluctuations '' in density and speed time series of the experiments , but the demarcation of the `` small fluctuations '' is ambiguous . moreover",
    ", the specific relationship between steady state and the flow is unknown . up to now , no generally accepted method was used to detect steady state in bottleneck experiments . manually selected steady state can be used , but the result varies with different steady states from different researchers . for automatical method ,",
    "krausz et al .",
    "@xcite did similar work by using a cumulative sum control chart ( cusum ) algorithm to detect transitions from the optical flow computations at the loveparade 2010 in duisburg .    in this work , a feasible method to detect steady state",
    "is proposed and the steady state of pedestrian flow in bottleneck experiments is studied .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 a cusum algorithm",
    "is proposed and improved to automatically detect steady state , and the threshold of the detection parameter in the algorithm is calibrated using an autoregressive model .",
    "section 3 applies the modified cusum algorithm to three groups of bottleneck experiments , and compares the flows in all states and in steady state .",
    "finally , the conclusions are made in section 4 .",
    "in pedestrian dynamics , time series of the variables density @xmath2 , speed _ v _ and flow _ j _ and their steady states are used to characterize the transport of pedestrian streams .",
    "the classic definition of flow is the number of the pedestrians passing a line per unit time :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the time gap between the crossing of two following pedestrians , and _",
    "t _ is the time for all the pedestrians _ n _ passing the measurement line .",
    "a reasonable resolution is necessary to identify steady state , but microscopic measurements of the flow by time gaps or mean values over small intervals could lead to strong fluctuations .",
    "these flow fluctuations are caused by the relationship between the size of the objects ( here pedestrians ) and the size of the facilities in combination with ordering phenomena like the zipper effect ( see figure 5 and figure 7 in @xcite ) . to deal with this problem",
    ", we refer to the flow equation from fluid dynamics :    @xmath5    where _ w _ indicates the width of the facility . here",
    "@xmath2 and _ v _ is the mean density and mean speed in the measurement area , respectively .",
    "following this equation , the steady states based on density and speed are a good indicator for the steady state of flow .    in this paper , we aim to detect steady state from the flow in equation ( 1 ) with relatively short time series .",
    "the series lengths are too short to obtain precise flow estimations , so we use the density and speed variables in equation ( 2 ) to determinate if the system is in steady state .",
    "the aforementioned density and speed are calculated using the voronoi method to obtain estimations with low fluctuations ( see equation ( 8) and ( 9 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "this approach allows precise detection of the steady state at the scale of only few seconds .      since the detection of steady state is a sort of transition detection , the cusum algorithm",
    "is proposed in this work .",
    "it is a sequential analysis technique which is initially used for monitoring transition detection @xcite .",
    "the precondition of the cusum algorithm is a reference process with observations in normal situation .",
    "let @xmath6 denote a sequence of observations in density or speed .",
    "the manually selected steady state can be regarded as the reference process @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see the interval between the two green dash - dotted lines in figure 1 ) .",
    "q(@xmath10 ) _ and _ q(1-@xmath10 ) _ represent the upper and lower @xmath10-percentile of the distribution in the reference process @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the cusum algorithm continuously accumulates the deviations of the observations @xmath6 from the @xmath10-percentiles @xcite :    @xmath11    the statistics @xmath12 and @xmath13 show the degree of the fluctuations in @xmath6",
    ". if the distribution of @xmath6 is different from the distribution of @xmath7 , then the statistics increase .",
    "therefore , the cusum algorithm is able to detect the transitions of the observations from the given reference process .",
    "the specific way is combining @xmath12 and @xmath13 with a threshold of the detection parameter @xmath14 , then the interval with both @xmath12 and @xmath13 under @xmath14 is the steady state",
    ".    0.49   in ( a ) density and ( b ) speed .",
    "the interval between the two green dash - dotted lines is the manually selected steady state , which is regarded as the reference process @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the interval between the two red dashed lines is the final steady state , which is obtained using the detected steady state minus the corresponding reaction time.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.49   in ( a ) density and ( b ) speed .",

    "first , since the statistics @xmath12 and @xmath13 are combined to detect the steady state , it is redundant to calculate them separately . therefore , new statistics @xmath15 are introduced ( equation ( 5 ) ) .",
    "second , the response of the statistics to the fluctuations in @xmath6 is not sensitive enough .",
    "the increase rate and decrease rate of the statistics are not the same .",
    "to solve this problem , a step function is introduced to enhance the sensitivity of the response ( equation ( 6 ) ) .",
    "third , the criterion in equation ( 6 ) is not the @xmath10-percentiles of @xmath7 any more .",
    "the replacement is @xmath16 , which is the upper @xmath10-percentile in a standard normal distribution @xmath17 .",
    "accordingly , the standard score transformation of the observations @xmath6 is used ( equation ( 7 ) ) .",
    "fourth , the maximum value of the statistics is very large that it needs a long time to get back to steady state again . as an improvement",
    ", a boundary @xmath18 is introduced to limit the increase of the statistics .",
    "last but not least , since it is unknown whether at the beginning the statistics are in steady state or not , the value of @xmath19 should be equal to the boundary @xmath18 . from the above ,",
    "the modified cusum algorithm is as follows :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the mean of @xmath7 , and @xmath22 is the standard deviation of @xmath7 . as shown in figure 2 , the statistics @xmath15 calculated by the modified cusum algorithm have sensitive response to the fluctuations , and the trend of the statistics is clear .",

    "the interval with @xmath23 under @xmath14 is the detected steady state.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we should note that the detected transitions ( the interactions in figure 2 ) are not the real transitions in the observations @xmath6 .",
    "there is a reaction time caused by the detection procedure itself .",
    "when reaching steady state and leaving steady state , the reaction time is calculated as follows , respectively :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the frame number per second in the observations . the final steady state is using the detected transitions minus the corresponding reaction times ( see the interval between the two red dashed lines in figure 1 ) .      the accurate detection of steady state depends on the detection parameter s threshold @xmath14 to be calibrated .",
    "for a neyman - pearson statistical test , @xmath26 is the upper @xmath27-percentile of the statistics @xmath28 for the reference process @xmath7 . in this way ,",
    "we are able to control the probability of detecting a false transition , which is the risk level 1-@xmath27 .    different methods to calibrate @xmath14 are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the simplest way is the direct calibration with the reference process @xmath7",
    "( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "this method requires that the number of the selected observations in the reference process should be large enough for calibration .",
    "if not , a bootstrap method is used to expand the reference process @xcite .",
    "the requirement is that the observations in @xmath7 should be independent of each other , or that the number of the observations in @xmath7 should be large enough ( moving block bootstrap ) .    .",
    "]    in this work , the observations do not meet any requirements of the two empirical methods in figure 3 .",
    "therefore , an autoregressive process @xmath29 is proposed to model the standard score of the reference process @xmath30 :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the first autocorrelation of @xmath30 , and @xmath33 are independent normal random variables .",

    "for instance if @xmath38 , the process has to be simulated @xmath39 steps to obtain precise results .",
