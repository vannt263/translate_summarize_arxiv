    "measurements of level energies of low - lying states in helium provide very sensitive tests of basic theory of atomic structure .",
    "although helium is a two - electron system , energy levels of the nonrelativistic helium atom can be calculated with a precision that is , for all practical purposes , as good as for nonrelativistic hydrogen .",
    "relativistic corrections to these energies can be calculated in a power series of the fine structure constant @xmath7 and have been calculated up to @xmath8 .",
    "effects of the finite nuclear mass can be included in a power series of the mass ratio @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the reduced electron mass and @xmath11 the nuclear mass .",
    "qed corrections , both hydrogenic and electron - electron terms , up to @xmath12 have been calculated as well .",
    "effects of the finite nuclear size can be incorporated straightforwardly  @xcite .",
    "present day theory aims at calculating higher - order corrections ( in @xmath7 , @xmath9 ) and cross terms ( such as relativistic recoil ) .",
    "the most difficult terms to date are the relativistic and qed terms of @xmath13 and higher .",
    "higher - order corrections are largest for low - lying s - states and therefore the most sensitive tests of atomic structure calculations can be performed for the @xmath14 ground state and the metastable states @xmath15 ( lifetime 20 ms ) and @xmath16 ( lifetime @xmath17 ) .",
    "present - day laser spectroscopy on the low - lying s - states has several disadvantages .",
    "to extract an experimental value for the ionisation energy of these states the transition frequency to a high - lying state has to be accurately measured and one has to rely on theoretical values of the ionisation energy of the upper state in the transition . here",
    "the lifetime of the upper state and line shifts due to stray electric fields and laser power are limiting factors . for the ground state ,",
    "excitation is difficult : one photon of @xmath18 is required to excite the @xmath19 state @xcite or two photons of @xmath20 to excite the @xmath21 state @xcite . for the @xmath21 and @xmath16 metastable states cw laser light is used to excite with one photon the @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24  @xcite states .",
    "two - photon spectroscopy is applied to excite the @xmath25 state @xcite and @xmath26 states @xcite .    the most accurate transition frequency measurement to date is for the @xmath27 transition  @xcite , with an absolute accuracy of @xmath28 .",
    "this measurement , however , does not provide an accurate measurement of the @xmath16 ionisation energy as the @xmath29 ionisation energy is not known well enough .",
    "moreover , recent measurements of the fine structure splitting of the @xmath22 state have shown that experiment and theory do not agree at the @xmath30 level  @xcite .",
    "this very recent finding is considered an outstanding problem of bound state qed and asks for independent measurements on other transitions with similar accuracy .",
    "experimental accuracies for the ionisation energy of the @xmath21 and @xmath16 states , deduced from measurements to highly excited states and relying on the theoretical calculations of the ionisation energies of these states , are @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "these values agree with but are more accurate than present - day theory for the 2 @xmath33s@xmath34 and 2 @xmath5s@xmath35 ionisation energy , which is accurate to 5 mhz @xcite and 1 mhz @xcite respectively .",
    "the theoretical accuracies represent the estimated magnitude of uncalculated higher - order terms in qed calculations .",
    "qed shifts largely cancel when identical transitions in different isotopes are studied .",
    "measuring the isotope shift , the main theoretical inaccuracy is in the difference in the rms charge radius of the nuclei @xcite .",
    "as the charge radius of the @xmath6he nucleus is the most accurately known of all nuclei ( including the proton ) isotope shifts measure the charge radius of the other isotope involved . in this way",
    "accurate determination of the 2 @xmath5s@xmath35 - 2 @xmath5p transition isotope shift have allowed accurate measurements of the charge radius of @xmath5he @xcite and the unstable isotope @xmath36he @xcite , challenging nuclear physics calculations .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that the measurement of the @xmath6he nuclear radius has sofar not been reproduced @xcite .",
    "these measurements therefore primarily measure differences in charge radius .    elaborating on an idea of baklanov and denisov  @xcite",
    "we propose direct laser excitation of the @xmath37 transition in a slow atomic beam or in an optical lattice . this transition has the advantage of an intrinsically narrow natural linewidth of 8 hz and a wavelength of @xmath38 m .",
    "also , as the transition connects two states of the same @xmath39 configuration , the theoretical error in the transition frequency may be smaller than the error in the ionisation energy of the individual states @xcite .",
    "the main disadvantage is that the transition is extremely weak ; the einstein a - coefficient for this magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transition is 14 orders of magnitude smaller than for the electric dipole ( e1 ) @xmath40 transition . in this paper",
    "we show that with 2 w of a narrowband fiber laser at @xmath38 m we can excite more than 1 in @xmath41 atoms in an atomic beam experiment or more than 1% of atoms trapped in a one - dimensional standing light wave .",
    "present - day sources of metastable helium atoms  @xcite easily provide sufficient atoms in either an atomic beam or in a trap to observe the transition .",
    "the magnetic dipole transition between the metastable @xmath42 state and the @xmath14 ground state determines the @xmath43 lifetime of the @xmath16 state .",
    "the experimental and theoretical values of the rate constant for this transition , @xmath44 s@xmath45 @xcite and @xmath46 @xcite respectively , agree very well . for the electronically similar transition from @xmath16 to @xmath21 ,",
    "rate constants of @xmath47  @xcite and @xmath48  @xcite have been published . in this letter",
    "we will use the value @xmath49 s@xmath45 , obtained by pachucki  @xcite applying the same formalism as used for the calculation of the @xmath16 to @xmath50 transition rate @xcite .",
    "this value is assumed to be accurate at the 1% level .    in order to evaluate the feasibility of detecting the transition",
    ", we need to choose an experimental configuration .",
    "several approaches can be considered  @xcite : spectroscopy in a discharge cell , on a thermal or laser - cooled beam , on a cold cloud in a magnetic or optical trap , and ultimately spectroscopy on atoms in an optical lattice . here ,",
    "we first consider a relatively simple but promising setup : spectroscopy on a laser - cooled and collimated beam as produced on a daily basis in groups working on bec in metastable helium  @xcite .",
    "in order to describe the excitation of the @xmath51 magnetic dipole transition , we use a simplified set of optical bloch equations ( obe s ) .",
    "the decay rate of the upper level is fully dominated by the two - photon ( 2e1 ) decay to the ground state : @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "[ fig : transition ] summarizes the relevant decay rates .",
    "the driven rabi frequency of the transition ( with atomic frequency @xmath53 ) is denoted by @xmath54 , the detuning by @xmath55 .",
    "we model this transition by the following set of obe s :    @xmath56    as the ground state is not included , this set of equations does not have a steady state state solution except the trivial one ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "when we simplify this set of equations by neglecting @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( which is certainly valid for times @xmath60 ) , it can be solved analytically .",

    "[ eq : weak ] and [ eq : strong ] allow us to account effectively for both the finite bandwidth of the excitation laser and doppler broadening effects . for this , we will assume excitation by a purely inhomogeneously broadened light source , i.e. , the light is described by a monochromatic field with fixed irradiance @xmath76 and a statistical probability distribution @xmath77 for the frequency .",
    "the distribution is assumed to be gaussian , centered at the transition frequency @xmath53 and with an rms width @xmath78 with @xmath79 the interaction time , i.e. , the time at which the upper state population is calculated .",

    "the transition is excited by the beam of a 2 watt cw fiber laser with a linewidth of @xmath93 , intersecting the atomic beam perpendicularly . for simplicity",

    "can be deflected by simple radiation pressure . using surface ionisation and an electron multiplier on the non - deflected upper state atoms , in principle all excited atoms ( @xmath21 )",
    "can then be detected .",
    "@xmath21 atoms produced by the discharge beam source can be very efficiently suppressed in the laser cooling stages used to prepare the atomic beam .",
    "thus , we can expect a workable signal .",
    "the spectroscopic linewidth of @xmath102 is dominated by the doppler width .",
    "decreasing the doppler width as well as reducing the laser linewidth are the first steps towards decreasing the spectroscopic linewidth .",
    "the limiting homogeneous linewidth is given by the @xmath30 interaction time broadening .",
    "applying multiple crossings of laser and atomic beam using roof - top prisms will not only increase the signal proportionally , but also decrease the interaction time broadening . as a bonus ,",
    "possible doppler shifts due to nonorthogonal excitation can be monitored and minimised in this configuration . a schematic view of the proposed setup , with three crossings depicted , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the @xmath2 wavelength of the forbidden transition can also serve well to form a far off - resonance optical trap ( fort ) for the @xmath16 atoms .",
    "the dynamic polarisability at this wavelength is fully dominated by the contribution of the @xmath103 transition that is resonant at @xmath104 .",
    "this can be used in a next - generation spectroscopy experiment . as the trapping potential is fully insensitive to the wavelength on the scale of a spectroscopic scan of the forbidden transition ,",
    "a single laser can be simultaneously used for trapping and spectroscopy .",
    "we propose using a cold atomic cloud and transferring this cloud to a one - dimensional optical dipole trap formed by a single retroreflected laser beam .",
    "we assume @xmath105 atoms in a cloud with rms size @xmath106 ( radial ) by @xmath107 ( axial ) at a temperature of @xmath108 , as typically produced along the route to bec production @xcite .",
    "the average density in this cloud then equals @xmath109 .",
    "we now assume a more stable 2 watt fiber laser with a linewidth of @xmath30 .",
    "the trapping / spectroscopy laser beam , directed along the long axis of the cigar - shaped cloud , has a waist radius of @xmath110 .",
    "this produces a trapping dipole potential with a maximum depth of @xmath111 , to which the full cloud can be transferred .",
    "analysis of this trap indicates that roughly half the atoms end up in the lowest vibrational state of the standing wave `` micro - traps '' along the laser beam axis .",
    "this will effectively cause a strong doppler - free part in the spectroscopic signal by lamb - dicke narrowing of the transition .",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath112 , where the extra factor of two is due to the fact that the atoms are now trapped at the antinodes of the standing wave .",
    "there is now no _ a priori _ fixed interaction time .",
    "however , as the rabi frequency is high we can easily choose the excitation to last a time @xmath113 satisfying the time - averaged strong excitation limit ( @xmath73 ) : @xmath114 ms .",
    ".  [ eq : rhoistrong ] then results in an averaged excited state fraction @xmath115 .",
    "given the number of atoms in the trap , every trapped sample will lead to @xmath116 atoms in the excited state , which have to be detected . in an experiment ,",
    "the trapping / excitation laser can be set off - resonance for trapping , and switched to the frequency of the forbidden transition to excite the atoms to the @xmath21 state .",
    "we can then detect the excited atoms by photoionisation after a few milliseconds of excitation ( adjusting the geometry of the ionisation laser beam to ionise all @xmath21 atoms expelled from the trap ) .",
    "an alternative detection option is simply by measuring the increased penning ionisation that we expect when atoms are excited .",
    "the excited @xmath21 atoms can also decay through penning ionisation in collisions with the @xmath16 atoms .",
    "we assume the rate constant of this process to be @xmath117 , i.e. , on the order of the rate constant for penning ionisation of unpolarised atoms in the @xmath16 state  @xcite .",
    "this results in a decay rate of @xmath118 , leading to a homogeneous broadening of the transition with this value .",
    "however , as the dipole shift of the excited @xmath21 state has opposite sign , the excited atoms are anti - trapped and escape the cloud of @xmath16 atoms in @xmath119 . then penning ionisation stops , effectively reducing the total @xmath21 ionisation rate by a factor of 30 as compared to the case of perfect overlap .",
    "as the doppler width is effectively eliminated by lamb - dicke narrowing , the linewidth is now determined by the laser linewidth . as this width",
    "can be further reduced , ultimately the limiting factor will be simply the upper level decay rate .",
    "however , systematic shifts of the transition frequency will have to be carefully considered and corrected for .",
    "the largest shift is caused by the difference in dipole shift between the lower and upper level of the transition and amounts to @xmath120 for the chosen lattice parameters . in optical lattice experiments aiming at optical frequency standards",
    "one selects a lattice laser wavelength at which the stark shift of the lower state equals the stark shift of the upper state ( the ` magic ' wavelength ) . for helium",
    "there is no practical wavelength available .",
    "the highest magic wavelengths are around @xmath121 , where ( accidentally ) the dipole shift itself is so small that no lattice is feasible at reasonable laser power , and at @xmath122 , where the polarisability is 15 times smaller than at 1.557 @xmath10 m and the sign is such that the atoms can not be confined at antinodes . at 1.557 @xmath10 m ,",
    "combining measurements of the transition frequency at different laser intensities with careful calculations of the intensity - dependent dipole shift will still allow for very accurate extrapolation to zero stark shift .",
    "collisional shifts , vanishingly small in the beam experiment , may contribute as well in the lattice experiment .",
    "for fermions this shift will be absent at the temperatures considered .",
    "the beam and lattice experiment both promise signal strengths and linewidths that should make a measurement with @xmath123 resolution possible .",
    "improvements beyond this level also seem feasible .",
    "standard frequency comb technology easily allows an absolute frequency measurement at this accuracy .",
    "a fiber - laser based frequency comb around @xmath124 or a titanium - sapphire laser based frequency comb ( after frequency doubling ) may be used for this purpose .",
    "the main obstacles to be overcome are the residual doppler linewidth for the beam experiment and the dipole and collisional shifts for the lattice experiment .",
    "another factor to be considered in both experiments is the zeeman shift due to a stray magnetic field .",
    "a solution is to measure only an @xmath125 transition . for @xmath6he ,",
    "this can be achieved by simply exciting with linearly polarised light . for @xmath5he",
    ", it will be important to shield stray magnetic fields and measure both @xmath126 and @xmath127 transitions and take the average .    what will an absolute frequency measurement at or below the @xmath123 level in @xmath6he ( or @xmath5he ) test ?",
    "in a recent paper morton , wu and drake @xcite have tabulated the most up - to - date experimental and theoretical ionisation energies , both for @xmath6he and @xmath5he .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties for the @xmath16 and @xmath21 states are larger than the experimental error for @xmath6he for both states .",
    "experiment and theory agree to well within the error bars .",
    "it may be expected that the theoretical error in the 1.557 @xmath10 m _ transition _ frequency will be smaller than the quadratic sum of the errors in the ionisation energy of the metastable states due to cancellation effects @xcite .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the @xmath16 - @xmath21 transition frequency will not only provide a direct and accurate link between the ortho ( triplet ) and para ( singlet ) helium system but will also test qed calculations more stringently than the existing data",
    ".    the isotope shift can be calculated with very high accuracy .",
    "using the most recent values for the nuclear masses and the most recent evaluation of the difference in the square of the nuclear charge radii , i.e. , 1.0594(26 ) @xmath128 @xcite , we deduce a theoretical transition isotope shift of 8034.3712(9 ) mhz .",
    "a measurement of the isotope shift thus provides a very sensitive test of theory .",
    "it may also be interpreted as a measurement of the difference in nuclear charge radius of @xmath6he and @xmath5he .",
    "a measurement at the 1 khz level will provide this difference with an accuracy of 0.001 fm  @xcite , similar to the accuracy obtained from isotope shift measurements on the @xmath16 - @xmath22 transition .",
    "these have been performed with @xmath1295 khz accuracy @xcite , limited by the 1.6 mhz natural linewidth of that transition .",
    "the 8 hz natural linewidth of the 1.557 @xmath10 m transition and the possibilities to improve the beam and lattice experiment further via sub - doppler cooling resp .",
    "uncoupling of the trapping and spectroscopy lasers , may push the accuracy below the 1 khz level providing new challenges to theorists calculating ionisation energies and , in the case of the isotope shift , provide the most accurate data on differences in nuclear charge radius and nuclear masses of the isotopes involved ."
