    "one of the first studies which uncovered propagating wave phenomena in coronal structures was that by @xcite .",
    "these authors utilised the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope on board the solar and heliospheric observatory spacecraft to identify quasi - periodic perturbations in the brightness of @xmath14   images .",
    "@xcite undertook a similar study using the higher spatial resolution transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and concluded that these oscillations were signatures of slow magneto - acoustic waves , which propagate upwards along the coronal waveguides with velocities of @xmath15@xmath16  kms@xmath11 and periods in the range @xmath17@xmath18  s. energy estimates for these motions exhibit an incredibly wide range of values , typically @xmath19@xmath20  ergs@xmath21s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "since magnetic fields play an essential role in plume / fan / coronal - loop formation and structuring , they are often modelled using magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations @xcite .",
    "utilising non - linear , two - dimensional mhd simulations , @xcite were able to replicate previous observational results , and concluded that outward - propagating slow magneto - acoustic waves may be able to contribute significantly to the heating of the lower corona through compressive dissipation .",
    "furthermore , theoretical modelling has suggested that the propagation characteristics of a magneto - acoustic intensity perturbation depends on a number of factors , including the dissipation of the wave energy @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that thermal conduction may be the dominant damping mechanism behind the dissipation of magneto - acoustic wave energy in the solar corona @xcite .        through examination of coronal structures in the close proximity of active regions ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite were able to reveal how structures situated above sunspot regions displayed intensity oscillations with a period of the order of three minutes , while oscillations in `` non - sunspot '' structures demonstrated much longer periodicities @xcite .",
    "the authors concluded that the most likely explanation for the observed longitudinal waves revolves around a driver directly exciting the magnetic footpoints .",
    "this scenario requires the magneto - acoustic wave trains to be able to propagate from the lower solar atmosphere , through the transition region , and into the corona . utilising numerical simulations of the sun s lower atmosphere ,",
    "@xcite have revealed how longitudinal oscillations , generated with a periodicity of @xmath1@xmath5  minutes in sunspot umbrae , can readily propagate upwards from the photosphere and into the chromosphere .    previously , three minute umbral oscillations have been notoriously difficult to detect at photospheric heights .",
    "@xcite were unable to detect any photospheric signatures using the locarno solar station at the gttingen observatory , while @xcite suggested that they may get lost in the noise , as a result of their very low amplitude .",
    "indeed , @xcite utilised hinode / sot image sequences to show how oscillatory power , at all frequencies , is significantly reduced in sunspot umbrae .",
    "more recently , @xcite have not only detected photospheric three minute oscillations , but the authors also claim that the location of maximum chromospheric power also corresponds to a co - spatial decrease in power of the photospheric oscillations .",
    "however , the spatial resolution obtained by @xcite was on the order of 1 , so precise diagnostics of the exact umbral structures displaying three minute periodicities was impossible .    in this paper , we utilise ground- and space - based instrumentation , with high spatial , temporal and spectral resolution , to investigate the origin of @xmath5  minute magneto - acoustic waves observed in euv images of coronal fan structures .",
    "we employ a multi - wavelength approach to study the photospheric counterpart of these coronal phenomena , and analyse the resulting wave propagation characteristics from the photosphere , through the chromosphere , and out into the corona .",

    "our ground - based observations were subjected to cross - correlation techniques to provide sub - pixel co - alignment accuracy between the imaging sequences . to do this ,",
    "the plate scales of our ground - based observations were first degraded to match that of the aia image .",
    "next , squared mean absolute deviations were calculated between the datasets , with the ground - based images subsequently shifted to best align with the aia reference image ( see the lower panels of figure  [ fig2 ] for interlaced examples ) .",

    "using a combination of ground- and space - based datasets , we were able to analyse image sequences from the photosphere through to the corona . due to the wide range of atmospheric heights covered ,",
    "this section is divided into sub - sections in which we discuss different regions of the solar atmosphere .      to investigate oscillatory phenomena occurring in the sunspot umbra , we first masked out all other areas of the field - of - view .",
    "this was deemed desirable so that intrinsically faint umbral structures would become much more apparent in scaled intensity images . to isolate the umbra ,",
    "we first had to create a binary map , whereby umbral pixels were given a value of ` @xmath75 ' , and non - umbral pixels assigned a value of ` @xmath76 ' .",
    "this form of binary map was created by first averaging the @xmath0 continuum images over the entire @xmath23  minute duration of the dataset .",
    "next , the umbral pixels were defined as those with an intensity below @xmath74% of the median granulation intensity , and subsequently assigned a value of ` @xmath75 ' . this accurately defined the perimeter of the dark umbra .",
    "however , some small - scale structures , which existed inside the umbra ( e.g. , umbral dots ; uds ) , exhibited higher relative intensity values . therefore , to include all structures which existed inside the umbral boundary ,",
    "all pixels which lay inside the outer perimeter were assigned a value of ` @xmath75 ' , while all other pixels were given a value of ` @xmath76 ' .",

    "the red , blue , green , and pink lines represent umbral dots ud1 , ud2 , ud3 , and ud4 , respectively , while a black dashed line highlights a phase angle of @xmath76@xmath80 . ]    examination of the time - averaged umbral intensity map ( middle panel of figure  [ fig3 ] ) revealed a collection of near - circular brightenings .",
    "these brightenings are consistent with the signatures of uds , whereby they typically exhibit diameters between @xmath81  @xmath82 , and intensities @xmath83  @xmath10 times brighter than the background umbral value @xcite . due to their sharp appearance in a time - averaged intensity image ,",
    "it hints at the persistent nature of such structures in the same spatial location , either through long lifetimes ( e.g. , @xmath3  minutes or more ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by the reappearance of new uds in the same spatial location .",
    "analysing simultaneous g - band and continuum filtergrams , @xcite found that uds , when observed in the g - band , displayed dark fine - structuring towards their core .",
    "contrarily , this author found that these dark features are not as readily visible in the continuum , and concluded this may be due to the reduced resolution of the longer wavelength and longer exposure images .",
    "however , our continuum images were obtained at a shorter wavelength than the g - band ( @xmath0 versus @xmath84 ) , in addition to being captured with a much shorter exposure time ( @xmath54  ms versus @xmath85  ms ) .",
    "thus , we can not attribute a lack of dark fine - scale structuring in the uds observed in the @xmath0 continuum to either reduced spatial resolution , or exposure - time related smearing of the images .",
    "@xcite recently determined the contribution functions of the g - band and @xmath0 continuum filter bandpases used at the dst , and concluded that the blue continuum is formed at a height of @xmath1@xmath86  km , while the g - band is formed approximately @xmath87  km higher .",
    "this atmospheric height separation between the two bandpasses , in addition to the appearance of diatomic ch molecules in the g - band images , may contribute to the presence of dark cores observed in g - band uds .",
    "since we are concerned with the larger macro - scale fluctuations in umbral intensity , rather than the very small - scale structuring ( e.g. , dark features within uds ) which may be close to , if not overlap with the telescope s diffraction limit , our photospheric umbral time series was created purely from consecutive @xmath0 continuum images .",
    "these images were multiplied by the umbral binary map , producing a dataset which could be analysed with fourier techniques . following the methodology of @xcite ,",
    "the wavelet analysis routines of @xcite were applied to the @xmath0 continuum umbral time series to search for the presence of oscillatory behaviour .",
    "considerable oscillatory power was present throughout the sunspot umbra , with dominant peaks in the fourier spectrum at @xmath5 and @xmath79 minutes .",
    "this is consistent with the generalised @xmath88-mode spectrum of sunspot oscillations @xcite .",
    "however , when locations of high oscillatory power were examined , it became evident that the uds displayed significant enhancements of wave amplitude , at periodicities of approximately @xmath5  minutes .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ fig3 ] shows the spatial locations where oscillatory power at approximately @xmath5 minutes is in excess of @xmath89 times the background umbral value . to test whether these long - lived umbral brightenings oscillate in phase with the surrounding umbra , temporally filtered time series of these structures were first created by passing each spatially - averaged ud intensity through a @xmath77 ",
    "@xmath78  minute bandpass filter .",
    "the resulting lightcurves , dominated by power corresponding to the @xmath5  minute @xmath88-mode oscillations , are displayed in the upper panel of figure  [ fig4 ] , along with a filtered time series representing a region of the quiet umbra devoid of any transient brightenings .",
    "it is clear that not only do the peaks and troughs of the ud oscillations appear similar in time , but these signatures also closely follow the oscillations originating from within the background umbra .    to quantify any small - scale differences in the oscillating ud time series , a phase difference analysis with respect to the background umbra",
    "was performed .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig4 ] reveals the phase difference between each of the four ud time series , and an isolated region of the background umbra ( i.e. the solid black line in the upper panel of figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that a preference exists for the uds to oscillate in phase with the background umbra .",
    "maximum deviations in the phase angle reach approximately @xmath90@xmath91@xmath80 , although these may be due to slight drifts in oscillation period between the respective time series .",
    "for example , the phase angle related to ud1 ( red line in the lower panel of figure  [ fig4 ] ) drifts a total of @xmath4@xmath92@xmath80 over a @xmath93  s time duration , providing an average shift of @xmath4@xmath94@xmath80s@xmath11 .",
    "this drift can be explained by a period discrepancy of only @xmath85  s between the ud and the background umbra , something which is well within the normal range of @xmath88-mode frequencies @xcite .",
    "thus , we interpret the umbra as a single oscillating `` drum skin '' , which not only induces wave motion in its inherent uds , but also causes these structures to oscillate in phase with one another .",
    "while @xcite and @xcite have shown that @xmath5  minute magneto - acoustic power is suppressed in sunspot umbrae as a result of local absorption and emissivity reduction , their spatial resolution was insufficient to allow studies of the smallest sunspot features ( e.g. , umbral dots ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that on small spatial scales , the curvature and strength of magnetic field lines have substantial influence on the efficiency of magneto - acoustic wave propagation . indeed , these authors suggest that wave power can actually be amplified under certain atmospheric conditions . following on from this , our observational data suggests that uds are able to enhance the background @xmath88-mode power by at least three orders - of - magnitude ( see e.g. , middle panel of figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this may be a result of the magnetic field lines acting as efficient conduits for magneto - acoustic wave propagation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "chromospheric information comes from the h@xmath39 core imaging dataset , in addition to the ca   @xmath95 spectral imaging scans taken with ibis .",
    "furthermore , doppler shifts of the ca   profile minimum allow a series of two - dimensional velocity maps to be generated @xcite .",
    "the ca   core image shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] is a true intensity map , created by establishing the line - profile minimum at each pixel . by displaying doppler - compensated line - centre intensities , rather than rest - wavelength intensities , brightness variations throughout the image",
    "are more indicative of the source function than of the velocities present in the line - forming region @xcite .    in a process identical to that applied to the photospheric image sequence ,",
    "the h@xmath39 and doppler - compensated ca   data sets were multiplied by the umbral binary map , and subsequently analysed using wavelet techniques .",
    "as for the @xmath0 continuum time series , considerable oscillatory power was present throughout the entire sunspot umbra , with dominant peaks in the fourier spectrum at @xmath5 and @xmath79 minutes .",
    "however , remaining consistent with @xcite , chromospheric power at periodicities of @xmath1@xmath79  minutes was much reduced when compared to those found in the photospheric umbra . to investigate whether oscillatory power detected in the chromosphere can be related to similar phenomena found in the photosphere ,",
    "the locations of high oscillatory power were examined .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig3 ] outlines the spatial locations where power , in both intensity and velocity signals at approximately @xmath5 minutes , is in excess of @xmath89 times the background umbral value .",
    "similar to the locations of high photospheric power displayed in the middle panel of figure  [ fig3 ] , several distinct groups manifest in a horseshoe shape in the south - west quadrant of the sunspot umbra .",
    "the locations of significant chromospheric power have two distinct differences when compared to their photospheric counterparts .",
    "first , their spatial positions are slightly offset from those displayed in the middle panel of figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "secondly , the spatial sizes of high chromospheric power are substantially larger than those found in the photosphere .",
    "these effects can be explained by the geometry of the magnetic field lines which stretch outwards from the solar surface .",
    "for example , high photospheric power encompassing ud2 ( middle panel of figure  [ fig3 ] ) has a local maximum at the heliocentric co - ordinate ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) , while the chromospheric local maximum is at ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) .",
    "thus , the offset between these two maxima is @xmath4@xmath100 , or @xmath4@xmath101  km . a separation between the @xmath0 continuum and the h@xmath39/ca   core formation heights of @xmath1@xmath102  km @xcite requires an inclination angle of @xmath4@xmath103 to support the assumption that the oscillatory signals are from a continuation of the same solar structure ( e.g. , * ?",
    "this is the largest offset present in our observations , and forms our upper limit of the magnetic field inclination angle .",
    "@xcite have recently shown that the inclination angles ( to the vertical ) of magnetic flux tubes within sunspot umbrae can be quite large ( @xmath104@xmath105 ) , with these structures often becoming horizontal near the penumbral boundary .",
    "furthermore , @xcite utilized stereoscopic observations of propagating slow - mode waves in coronal structures to infer an absolute inclination angle @xmath1@xmath103 .",
    "thus , an inclination angle of @xmath8@xmath103 supports the interpretation that oscillatory behaviour detected at photospheric and chromospheric layers are directly related by the magnetic field lines which extend upwards from the solar surface .",

    "@xcite were able to show that the radial expansion of magnetic flux tubes between photospheric and chromospheric heights can be as large as a factor of @xmath77 . assuming these magnetic flux tubes demonstrate an expanding cylindrical geometry , doubling the radial dimension will result in an area increase of @xmath107% .",
    "continuing with the previous example , the region of high oscillatory power encompassing ud2 covers @xmath108  pixels ( @xmath109  mm@xmath36 at @xmath110  km@xmath36pixel@xmath11 ) and @xmath111  pixels ( @xmath112  mm@xmath36 at @xmath113  km@xmath36pixel@xmath11 ) at photospheric and chromospheric heights , respectively . as a result ,",

    "the specific mode of oscillation can be determined through investigation of the coupling between intensity and velocity signals . here",
    ", we adopt the @xmath115 convention @xcite , which shows the delay of maximum intensity ( @xmath116 ) with respect to maximum blueshift velocity ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "thus , a wave which has a velocity signal trailing its intensity signal by @xmath118 of a period will have a @xmath115 phase angle of @xmath106 .",
    "due to the ca   absorption line being sensitive to temperature fluctuations @xcite , we follow the common practice to adopt the intensity ( @xmath116 ) as a proxy for the local temperature .",
    "@xcite has shown that when waves propagate along moderately inclined flux tubes , the phase lag between fluctuations in velocity and temperature are the same as those found in purely acoustic waves which have been modified by gravity . therefore , in a fully adiabatic scenario",

    "examination of the upper panel in figure  [ fig5 ] reveals how the unfiltered velocity time series ( dashed line ) trails the co - spatial intensity lightcurve ( solid line ) by approximately @xmath118 of a wave period .",
    "this effect becomes even more pronounced when the same time series are passed through a @xmath77  @xmath78  minute bandpass filter ( middle panel of figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "chromospheric waves detected within the contours of the right panel of figure  [ fig3 ] have a spatially and temporally averaged phase angle of @xmath121 , suggesting these waves are magneto - acoustic in nature , with characteristics consistent with standing acoustic modes @xcite .",
    "the generation of a chromospheric standing wave may be the result of a portion of the acoustic wave energy being reflected back at the transition region boundary @xcite .",
    "the spatial and temporal averaging of velocity signals found in the locations of high chromospheric power results in a net blueshift velocity of @xmath4@xmath10  kms@xmath11 ( upper panel of figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "while a @xmath115 phase angle of @xmath121 implies the presence of wave reflection , a net blueshift velocity may also indicate that a portion of the magneto - acoustic wave is propagating in the upward direction . to examine the propagation characteristics of the magneto - acoustic waves associated with the uds ,",
    "spatially - averaged h@xmath122 intensity time - series were constructed for each of the regions contoured in the right panel of figure  [ fig3 ] , and subsequently passed through a @xmath77 ",
    "@xmath78  minute bandpass filter to isolate oscillatory phenomena around 3  minutes .",
    "a phase difference analysis was performed between these chromospheric h@xmath122 lightcurves and their corresponding photospheric @xmath0 continuum counterparts created in section  [ photosphere ] , and displayed in the upper panel of figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "a preference for negative phase angles is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig5 ] , which indicates the oscillatory signals are first observed in the photospheric @xmath0 continuum , before later being detected in the chromospheric h@xmath122 time - series . by averaging the derived phase angles over all uds , an average phase lag of @xmath123 is found , implying the presence of upwardly propagating waves . using the dominant periodicity of @xmath4@xmath5  minutes ,",
    "a relative phase angle of @xmath124 equates to a time lag of @xmath4@xmath125  s. this is consistent with the photosphere - to - chromosphere time - lag measurements detailed in @xcite .",
    "however , due to a height separation of @xmath1@xmath102  km between the @xmath0 continuum and h@xmath39 core image sequences @xcite , a time lag of @xmath4@xmath125  s requires a phase speed exceeding @xmath92  kms@xmath11 .",
    "this is clearly unfeasible since a velocity this large will be supersonic , and violates our interpretation that the observed waves are magneto - acoustic slow modes .",
    "however , because the wave trains exist at the start of our observing sequence , and continue to be observed as the time - series finishes , a factor of @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) , where @xmath128 is an integer , may be absent from our derived phase angle . by considering @xmath129 , the phase lag increases to @xmath4@xmath130 , with the resulting phase speed reducing considerably to @xmath4@xmath131  kms@xmath11 . only by observing the start and/or end of a propagating wave train can the exact time lag ( and associated phase speed )",
    "be conclusively determined .",
    "nevertheless , the detected waves are best described as upwardly - propagating magneto - acoustic modes , which travel along magnetic flux tubes inclined to the vertical by less than @xmath4@xmath7 .",
    "such an inclination angle may explain why @xcite were unable to correlate ( on a pixel - by - pixel basis ) high chromospheric oscillatory power to that occurring in the underlying photosphere .",
    "our h@xmath39 dataset has a much higher cadence than the ca   core image sequence ( @xmath132  s instead of @xmath46  s ) .",
    "thus , examination of the h@xmath39 intensity time series can substantially reduce the associated errors when deriving the periodicities of the propagating magneto - acoustic waves . as can be seen in figure  [ fig5 ]",
    ", the h@xmath39 data displays prominent intensity oscillations , most of which last for the entire duration of the time series .",
    "a spatial and temporal averaging over the regions encompassed by the red contours in the right panel of figure  [ fig3 ] yields a peak chromospheric periodicity of @xmath133  s , consistent with the generalised @xmath88-mode spectrum of chromospheric sunspot oscillations @xcite .",
    "the close resemblance between h@xmath39 and ca   intensity time series suggests their formation heights are remarkably similar .",
    "this is also apparent by the similarities present in simultaneous snapshots through their respective filters ( e.g. , figure  [ fig1 ] ) .      due to the reduced spatial resolution of aia images ( @xmath77  pixel resolution @xmath4@xmath52 @xmath4@xmath134  km ) , when compared with our simultaneous datasets of the lower solar atmosphere ( @xmath77  pixel resolution @xmath4@xmath40 @xmath4@xmath87  km ) , it is imperative to concentrate on the larger - scale structures which will be apparent in all image sequences .",
    "following inspection of the co - aligned images displayed in the lower panels of figure  [ fig2 ] , it is clear that a number of fan structures rise out of the photospheric sunspot umbra , and into the corona .",
    "these structures are particularly visible as intensity enhancements in the coronal aia images , where the @xmath58 , @xmath14 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath62 bandpasses show similar structuring extending outwards in the south - west direction .",
    "however , these fan structures are mostly absent in the transition region @xmath61 images .        to investigate whether an absence of the fan brightenings in the @xmath61 images is a consequence of the structures lying outside of the filter s temperature response curve , differential emission measure ( dem ) techniques",
    "were employed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "utilising the six coronal euv channels on aia , we were able to construct emission measure ( @xmath135 ) and temperature ( @xmath136 ) estimates of active region noaa  @xmath29 , including its immediate vicinity .",
    "following the methodology presented by @xcite , each batch of near - simultaneous euv exposures allowed us to construct a time series of @xmath135 and @xmath136 variables , thus allowing the evolutionary changes in each sequence to be studied .",
    "importantly , the temperature of the coronal fan structures currently under investigation is in the range of @xmath137 ",
    "@xmath138  mk ( right panel of figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "their relatively cool temperature , when compared to the multi - million degree values found at the centre of the active region , probably manifest as a result of open magnetic field lines which can not trap heated plasma .",
    "an alternative explanation could revolve around their connection with quasi - separatrix layers , which may be subject to a peculiar heating function @xcite . while the @xmath61 bandpass has two distinct temperature response functions covering approximately @xmath65  k and @xmath10  mk",
    ", the fact that active region noaa  @xmath29 was positioned close to solar disk centre suggests that the resulting images should be dominated by the he   emission formed at @xmath1@xmath65  k , with contributions from the @xmath10  mk si   @xmath139 emission line minimal @xcite .",
    "this helps to explain why features near one million degrees ( e.g. , the fan structures extending outwards from the underlying sunspot ) , are not readily apparent in the transition region data .    examination of time - lapse movies of coronal euv images revealed clear and distinctly periodic outflows along the coronal fans . to quantify the associated periodicities and flow velocities , a series of one - dimensional slits",
    "were placed along the motion path in each of the coronal euv channels .",
    "the resulting time - distance cuts reveal numerous propagating wavefronts , indicated by straight , diagonal trends in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the aia euv images , in the temperature range of @xmath67 ",
    "@xmath71  mk ( incorporating the 131 , 171 , 193 , 211 , and 335 bandpasses ) , display a dominant periodicity of @xmath12  s , and a propagation velocity of @xmath13  kms@xmath11 .",
    "red and blue contours in the lower panel of figure  [ fig7 ] outline the intensity signals present in the higher temperature @xmath60 and @xmath62 bandpasses , respectively .",
    "it is clear that not only do the periodicities of the wave fronts closely resemble one another in both space and time , but the intensity gradients ( and hence wave speeds ) are also similar . propagating wave fronts",
    "are observed co - spatially , and simultaneously in all but the @xmath57 aia bandpass .",
    "the signal - to - noise of the @xmath57 channel is too low to extract a time series of sufficient quality for analysis .",
    "this may be compounded by the fact that the fan structures demonstrate a temperature much lower than the @xmath57 channel s peak response .",
    "a periodicity of @xmath4@xmath140  s and a propagation velocity @xmath4@xmath74  kms@xmath11 are consistent with @xcite , who utilised the @xmath14 and @xmath141 filters onboard the trace satellite to reveal how the propagation velocity of such waves will not exceed the local sound speed , even with a large inclination angle of the wave guides away from the observer s line - of - sight .",
    "the typical sound speed associated with the dominant fe emission from the @xmath14 bandpass is @xmath4@xmath142  kms@xmath11 @xcite , which requires the fans currently under investigation to have an inclination angle exceeding @xmath143 before the observed wave motion would become supersonic .",
    "an inclination angle this large is highly unrealistic due to the location of the active region on the solar disk , in addition to previous surveys of coronal magnetic geometries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we can conclude that the observed wave phenomena is best described as propagating slow - mode waves .",

    "the perimeter of the sunspot umbra is highlighted by a solid red line , demonstrating how the coronal fan is anchored into regions of high chromospheric oscillatory power ( see e.g. , the right panel in figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "a sample time - distance diagram of this fan is displayed in the lower panel , where @xmath76  km represents the sunspot umbra .",
    "red and blue contours outline @xmath60 and @xmath62 intensities , respectively , which are @xmath144% above the local quiescent background .",
    "a black dashed line represents the propagation of a typical wave front , where the gradient provides the wave speed , typically @xmath13",
    "wave phenomena which are co - spatial , co - temporal , and propagating with the same wave speed are readily apparent over a range of coronal temperatures . ]    since propagating wave fronts are detected in many of the aia euv bandpasses , emission measure and temperature maps were subsequently investigated for the presence of similar signatures . as the emission measure maps created here are the sum of ( squared ) electron densities along a given line - of - sight , the total mass distribution , regardless of the local temperature , can be studied as a function of time @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the derived pixel - by - pixel temperatures correspond to the peak of the dem distribution for a given line - of - sight , thus allowing the entire temperature range of the coronal plasma to be easily studied @xcite . applying the same techniques used on the euv image sequences , time - distance diagrams of the @xmath135 and @xmath136 variables derived for the fan structures reveal identical periodicities and propagation velocities as found in the euv images ( middle and upper panels of figure  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the emission measure is usually defined as @xcite , @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the electron density and @xmath147 is an emitting depth along the observer s line - of - sight . since the compressive phase of a magneto - acoustic wave mode will cause the emitting volume to decrease , thus reducing the overall emission measure , one would expect the @xmath135 time series to oscillate in phase with the corresponding euv intensities .",
    "however , as the plasma becomes compressed , the associated kinetic temperature will increase , thus causing the @xmath136 signal to oscillate out - of - phase with the @xmath135 and euv intensity signals .",
    "indeed , perturbations in the euv intensity , depicted in figure  [ fig7 ] , are found to occur in phase with the derived emission measure fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the lower panel in figure  [ fig8 ] reveals how oscillations in @xmath136 are found to be @xmath148 out - of - phase with respect to those detected in the @xmath135 signal .",
    "quantitatively , the detected fluctuations in the @xmath135 and @xmath136 values are typically in the range @xmath149  @xmath150k@xmath11 and @xmath151  mk , respectively .",

    "these values are displayed in the lower panel , where the solid line represents the emission measure , and the dashed line traces the temperature . both time series",
    "are displayed in their native units , as used in the top and middle panels .",
    "a clear anti - correlation between the @xmath135 and @xmath136 time series is readily apparent . ]          to model our observational findings , we performed a series of 1d numerical simulations using the lagrangian - remap code (; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which thermal conduction and optically thin radiation have been included @xcite .",
    "the @xmath75d model setup is constructed to closely match the observed aia  @xmath14 emission at the lowest coronal part of the fan structure . in particular , the density profile ( upper - left panel of figure  [ fig9 ] ) along the fan includes gravitational stratification , where the initial ( @xmath152 ) value is determined through equalisation of the forward - modelled and observed @xmath14 intensities , as can be seen in the upper - right panel of figure  [ fig9 ] . here",
    ", the solid line corresponds to the spatial variation in @xmath14 emission , obtained through forward - modelling of the temperature and density profiles inferred from the observed fan structure ( where the forward modelling is undertaken using a code developed by * ? ? ?",
    "a model temperature profile is constructed which utilises the minimum and maximum values of the ( isothermal ) temperatures extracted directly from the aia emission .",
    "the background magnetic field is taken to be constant . from the upper - right panel of figure  [ fig9 ] , it is clear that the theoretical model is in close agreement with the observed @xmath14 emission during the first @xmath153  mm along the fan .",
    "after this , the model emission declines more steeply than the observed @xmath14 emission .",
    "however , we are primarily concerned with the behaviour within the first @xmath153  mm , and therefore can neglect larger distances where the emission becomes faint , and the observations become more affected by detector noise .",
    "a slow magneto - acoustic wave is driven into the domain at the lower boundary , through periodic perturbations of the field - aligned velocity component .",
    "a snapshot of the velocity perturbations at @xmath154 minutes , using a driving period of @xmath140  s to match that of the observations , is shown in the lower - left panel of figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "a slow wave will propagate along the field at the characteristic tube speed , which is of the order of the local sound speed .",
    "incorporating a temperature @xmath4@xmath75  mk , and a background magnetic field strength @xmath4@xmath155  g , the tube speed is of the order of @xmath156  kms@xmath11 . combined with a driving period of @xmath140  s ,",
    "we expect a wavelength of the order of 22  mm , which can be verified in the lower panels of figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "after an initial increase , due to the rapidly decreasing background density , the velocity amplitudes are strongly damped through a combination of thermal conduction , optically thin radiation , and compressive viscosity .",
    "the corresponding density perturbations ( i.e. , the density profile at @xmath157 has been subtracted from the density at @xmath154 minutes ) are shown in the lower - right panel of figure  [ fig9 ] . such strong damping",
    "is predominantly caused by thermal conduction , as was previously uncovered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "only a small fraction of the overall damping can be attributed to optically thin radiation and compressive viscosity .    to achieve a more meaningful comparison with the perturbations",
    "observed by the aia instrument , we utilised the model density and energy ( temperature ) distributions along the loop , to forward - model the emission for different aia channels , at a multitude of time steps .",
    "we find that the modelled @xmath14 emission is significantly more intense over the first @xmath153  mm of the coronal fan structure , when compared to the @xmath59 and @xmath60 intensities .",
    "although these aia channels contain some emission lines at cooler temperatures , the @xmath59 and @xmath60 bandpasses mainly respond to hotter coronal temperatures ( i.e. , above @xmath10  mk ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hence only begin to display elevated intensities when the density reduces and the local temperature increases beyond @xmath75  mk .",
    "this is consistent with the aia observations , whereby the cooler @xmath14 emission dominates the first @xmath153  mm from the underlying sunspot . when forward - modelling intensity oscillations , it is important to remember that a variation in amplitude of the intensity perturbations is a combination of the change in amplitude of the model density and temperature fluctuations , as well as the individual response functions of the aia channels to different temperatures .",
    " , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 bandpasses , respectively , with each power spectrum normalised for clarity .",
    "dashed green lines displayed in the observed spectra ( top ) relate to the power associated with the hot ( @xmath1@xmath69  mk ) and cool ( @xmath158@xmath75  mk ) spectral components of the @xmath59 channel , with the cool component closely following the @xmath14 trend , and the hot component tending more towards the @xmath60 spectrum .",
    "the damping of magneto - acoustic wave power , at hotter temperatures first , is an indication that thermal conduction is the dominant damping mechanism . ]    finally , we utilise the global wavelet power , at each spatial position along the coronal fan , to compare the amplitude decay rates found in the different aia bandpasses in a more quantitative way . to do this ,",
    "a wavelet transform was performed at each position along the fan , with the temporally - averaged global wavelet power subsequently calculated .",
    "the red , green , and blue lines in figure  [ fig10 ] represent the time - averaged oscillatory power around 3  minutes , for the aia @xmath14 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 observed and forward - modelled bandpasses , respectively .",
    "note that each of these have been normalised to their individual maxima for display purposes .",
    "of particular note is the observed @xmath59 power spectrum . here , the solid green line represents the oscillatory power registered through the entire aia bandpass , while the dashed green lines relate to the power associated with the hot ( @xmath1@xmath69  mk ) and cool ( @xmath158@xmath75  mk ) spectral components of this channel .",
    "these components have been separated using the methods detailed in @xcite , with the resulting cool emission peaking alongside the @xmath14 power at @xmath4@xmath159  mm , and the hot emission displaying a peak between the @xmath14 and @xmath60 bandpasses ( @xmath4@xmath5  mm ) . in reality , the global wavelet power of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 emission is substantially lower than that of the @xmath14 emission .",
    "however , the time - averaged power of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 modelled intensities are very similar , as is the case for the observations . for these wavelengths ,",
    "the simulated global wavelet power reaches a minimum around @xmath155  mm , while the @xmath14 bandpass reaches its minimum power slightly further along the fan structure , at about @xmath153  mm .",
    "these results agree qualitatively with the observed time - averaged power , where the @xmath59 and @xmath60 channels near - simultaneously reach a minimum at about @xmath160  mm along the coronal fan , with the @xmath14 power diminishing completely by @xmath153  mm .",
    "this reiterates the importance of thermal conduction in the damping of coronal slow - mode waves .",
    "the increase in time - averaged global wavelet power , after @xmath4@xmath155  mm in both the simulated and observed @xmath59 and @xmath60 time series , is due to the fact that , despite the decreasing amplitudes of the model density and temperature , the percentage intensity perturbations in these channels are actually increasing .",
    "this is a result of the increased sensitivity of the aia @xmath59 and @xmath60 bandpasses to the @xmath104@xmath75  mk temperatures which have been reached by this distance along the fan structure .",
    "the increase is not as apparent in the observed @xmath59 and @xmath60 time - averaged wavelet power spectra , which may be due to the decreased signal - to - noise levels found in these channels , especially when compared to the @xmath14 bandpass .",
    "here we present high - cadence observations of the solar atmosphere , obtained using the latest ground- and space - based facilities .",
    "prominent oscillatory behaviour is detected throughout the optical and euv image sequences , with remarkable similarities found between the detected wave modes .",
    "first , a number of ud structures in the photospheric umbra are found to display intensity oscillations with a @xmath4@xmath5  minute periodicity .",
    "these oscillations exhibit considerable power , with regions encompassing the uds displaying more than three orders - of - magnitude stronger power than the background umbra ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "next , chromospheric intensity _ and _ velocity measurements were analysed for the presence of co - spatial and co - temporal oscillations .",
    "such phenomena were detected , both on larger spatial scales , and with small central offsets with respect to the underlying photospheric oscillations . by considering the extension of magnetic flux tubes from the solar surface out into the upper solar atmosphere ,",
    "a geometric expansion of only @xmath9% in the radial direction and an inclination angle @xmath8@xmath7 allows the observed oscillations to be interpreted as originating from within the same magnetic flux tube .    following examination of the phase lag between chromospheric velocity and intensity components , a @xmath115 phase angle of @xmath121",
    "was derived , allowing these waves to be described as a magneto - acoustic mode , with characteristics consistent with standing acoustic modes ( middle panel of figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the generation of a chromospheric standing wave may be the result of partial wave reflection at the transition region boundary .",
    "an average blueshift velocity of @xmath4@xmath10  kms@xmath11 was found in the locations where high chromospheric oscillatory power was present .",
    "this is a sub - sonic velocity , and coupled with a time lag between photospheric and chromospheric oscillatory phenomena , strengthens our interpretation that the observed oscillations are upwardly - propagating magneto - acoustic waves , which originate in ud structures located in the photospheric umbra .",
    "a prominent fan structure is present in the simultaneous coronal euv images , namely those from the aia @xmath58 , @xmath14 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath62 bandpasses .",
    "this fan is not readily apparent in either the transition - region dominated @xmath61 emission , or in the higher temperature ( @xmath1@xmath66  mk ) @xmath57 bandpass . using dem techniques , we constrained the temperature of the coronal fan to @xmath137 ",
    "@xmath138  mk , thus placing it outside the temperature range of both the @xmath57 and @xmath61 filtergrams ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "time - distance techniques were employed on the euv imaging data where the fan structure was readily apparent , allowing the characteristics of propagating wave phenomena to be uncovered .",
    "most coronal channels , regardless of their absolute temperature sensitivity , revealed outwardly propagating wave fronts with an average periodicity and velocity of @xmath12  s and @xmath13  kms@xmath11 , respectively ( lower panel of figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the out - of - phase nature between the derived temperature and emission measure signals indicates the presence of a compressive wave mode ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this , coupled with a sub - sonic wave speed ( @xmath4@xmath74  kms@xmath11 ) , highlights the fact that these coronal phenomena are best described as upwardly - propagating magneto - acoustic slow mode waves .    employing numerical simulations",
    ", we were able to accurately simulate the behaviour of the coronal euv emission .",
    "utilising input parameters derived directly from the aia observations , forward - modelling techniques allowed us to evolve velocity , density , and emissivity values forward in time , creating a time series which could be directly compared to the aia observations .",
    "crucially , our simulations revealed that thermal conduction is the primary damping mechanism behind the dissipation of magneto - acoustic slow - mode waves in the corona .",
    "other mechanisms , including optically thin radiation and compressive viscosity , play a secondary role in the damping of these oscillations .",
    "the fan structure observed in the aia images , which displays signatures of propagating magneto - acoustic waves , appears to have anchor points in the south - west quadrant of the photospheric sunspot umbra ( lower panels of figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "these locations are also consistent with the presence of large - amplitude wave phenomena detected in simultaneous photospheric and chromospheric image sequences .",
    "the co - temporal and co - spatial relationship between these upwardly - propagating magneto - acoustic wave modes , detected throughout the entire solar atmosphere , suggests such coronal phenomena may be driven by ud oscillations occurring inside the sunspot umbra . with this conclusion",
    ", it appears that photospheric structures which are on the order of @xmath161 ( @xmath162  km ) in diameter , can have a strong influence on coronal structures not only several thousand km above their position , but on structures which have expanded into the local plasma to diameters often exceeding @xmath155 ( @xmath163  km ) .",

    "<S> we use images of high spatial , spectral and temporal resolution , obtained using both ground- and space - based instrumentation , to investigate the coupling between wave phenomena observed at numerous heights in the solar atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of @xmath0 continuum images reveals small - scale umbral intensity enhancements , with diameters @xmath1@xmath2 , lasting in excess of @xmath3  minutes . </S>",
    "<S> intensity oscillations of @xmath4@xmath5  minutes are observed to encompass these photospheric structures , with power at least three orders - of - magnitude higher than the surrounding umbra . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous chromospheric velocity and intensity time series reveal an @xmath6 out - of - phase behavior , implying the presence of standing modes created as a result of partial wave reflection at the transition region boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we find a maximum wave guide inclination angle of @xmath4@xmath7 between photospheric and chromospheric heights , combined with a radial expansion factor of @xmath8@xmath9% . </S>",
    "<S> an average blue - shifted doppler velocity of @xmath4@xmath10  kms@xmath11 , in addition to a time lag between photospheric and chromospheric oscillatory phenomena , confirms the presence of upwardly - propagating slow - mode waves in the lower solar atmosphere . propagating oscillations in euv intensity </S>",
    "<S> are detected in simultaneous coronal fan structures , with a periodicity of @xmath12  s and a propagation velocity of @xmath13  kms@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations reveal that the damping of the magneto - acoustic wave trains is dominated by thermal conduction . </S>",
    "<S> the coronal fans are seen to anchor into the photosphere in locations where large - amplitude umbral dot oscillations manifest . </S>",
    "<S> derived kinetic temperature and emission measure time - series display prominent out - of - phase characteristics , and when combined with the previously established sub - sonic wave speeds , we conclude that the observed euv waves are the coronal counterparts of the upwardly - propagating magneto - acoustic slow - modes detected in the lower solar atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the first time , we reveal how the propagation of @xmath5  minute magneto - acoustic waves in solar coronal structures is a direct result of amplitude enhancements occurring in photospheric umbral dots . </S>"
