    "strong gravitational lensing of background sources by clusters of galaxies provides some of the most unambiguous evidence for the presence of large amounts of dark matter in clusters .",
    "lensing studies suggest that the mass in clusters is greater and more centrally concentrated than implied , for instance , by the x - ray properties ( e.g. , mellier , fort , & kneib 1993 ; lefvre  1994 ; waxman & miralda - escude 1995 ; smail  1995 ) .",
    "moreover , the mass appears to clump around the luminous galaxies , so that consideration of substructure and the effect of the massive central galaxy are often important for understanding the observations ( e.g. , miralda - escud 1995 ; see also tyson , kochanski , & dell antonio 1998 ) .",
    "this is particularly true in more moderate mass clusters with velocity dispersions @xmath9 , for which the proportionally larger gravitational effects of a massive cd must be included to properly account for the lensing ( williams , navarro , & bartelmann 1999 ) .",
    "although there have been great advances in our knowledge of the form of the density distributions of massive dissipationless particles in simulations of various resolution ( e.g. , dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1996 , 1997 ; moore  1998 , 1999b ) , our knowledge of the central mass distributions of actual galaxy clusters remains fragmentary .",
    "low redshift clusters , because of their larger angular sizes , can in principle provide a better opportunity for studying these mass distributions .",
    "their lensing properties are acutely sensitive to the shape of the inner cluster potential , although because such clusters tend to be of modest mass ( very high - mass clusters being few and far between ) , the individual galaxies will produce relatively larger perturbations on this potential , complicating the interpretation .    until recently ,",
    "moderate- to high - redshift clusters have been the exclusive purview of strong lensing studies , but lensing by low - redshift clusters has been gaining increased attention .",
    "for instance , allen , fabian , & kneib ( 1996 ) discovered a redshift @xmath10 lensed arc in the massive cooling flow cluster pks0745191 at @xmath11 .",
    "campusano , kneib , & hardy ( 1998 ) explored lensing models for a @xmath12 spiral galaxy located near the central elliptical in the richness class  0 cluster a3408 at @xmath13 ; they obtained an upper limit to the magnification factor of @xmath141.7 from their `` maximum mass '' model .",
    "this object turned out to be the only viable lensing candidate found in an imaging survey of 33 southern galaxy clusters with @xmath15 by cypriano  ( 2000 ) , who also presented an estimate of the expected number of arcs and arclets in low - redshift clusters .",
    "blakeslee & metzger ( 1999 ) discovered a lensed arc at @xmath16 in the nearby cd cluster a2124 at @xmath17 and found magnification factors near 10 from their best - fitting models of this system .",
    "despite the recent progress , the lensing properties of low - redshift clusters remain unclear .",
    "for instance , a2124 had by far the lowest redshift in the sample studied by williams  ( 1999 ) of 24 lensing clusters with measured velocity dispersions , the next nearest being at @xmath18 . in this paper",
    ", we present imaging and spectroscopic observations and give a lensing analysis of the redshift @xmath19 cluster abell 2152 in the hercules supercluster .",
    "the hercules supercluster is a close grouping of three abell clusters : the richness class  2 cluster a2151 ( the classical `` hercules cluster '' ) and the two richness  1 clusters a2147 and a2152 , all at @xmath20 .",
    "the supercluster was first identified by shapley ( 1934 ) .",
    "although a2151 dominates from the standpoint of the number of galaxies , a2152 is projected closest to the center of the grouping , which is so tight that a circle of just @xmath21 ( @xmath224 ) in diameter easily encompasses all three clusters .",
    "two other abell clusters , a2148 and a2107 , lie at about the same redshift and are only @xmath23  away . at lower density enhancements , the hercules supercluster forms part of an extended , filamentary supercluster that includes a2162 and a2197/a2199 about 3000  in the foreground and a2052/a2063 about 3000  in the background ( abell 1961 ; postman , huchra , & geller 1992 ) .",
    "this extended ten - cluster supercluster includes more members than any other supercluster in the postman  ( 1992 ) catalogue .",
    "all three members of the hercules supercluster proper are classified as bautz - morgan type  iii , rood - sastry class f clusters ( abell  1989 ; struble & rood 1987 ) , indicating morphological irregularity and perhaps dynamical youth .",
    "all three have relatively high spiral fractions , with that of a2151 being near 50% ( tarenghi  1980 ) .",
    "a2151 is also famous for its high degree of internal subclustering ( e.g. , bird  1995 ) .",
    "a2152 , the focus of this paper , has two bright early - type galaxies at its center ( see figure  [ fig : img ] ) that together are designated ugc10187",
    ". the brighter component ( ned  02 ) was chosen by postman & lauer ( 1995 ) as the a2152 brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) and has a redshift @xmath24 . the other component ( ned  01 )",
    "is 47to the northwest and about 0.5mag fainter ; postman & lauer classify it as the second ranked galaxy ( srg ) .",
    "the srg has a relative velocity of @xmath25330  with respect to the bcg ( see  [ sec : kinematics ] ) .    because a2152 and a2147 are separated by just 1.8  , measurements of their velocity dispersions are problematic .",
    "zabludoff  ( 1993 ) reported @xmath26  for a2147 and @xmath27  for a2152 , the latter being the highest dispersion in their sample of 25 `` dense peaks . '' recently , barmby & huchra ( 1998 ) have carried out a detailed analysis of the hercules supercluster kinematics using 414 galaxy velocities .",
    "these authors employed a four - component model , including the three abell clusters and a `` dispersed supercluster '' component .",
    "they derived much lower velocity dispersions of @xmath28   and @xmath29  for a2147 and a2152 , respectively , from 93 and 56 galaxy velocities .",
    "because 122 galaxies in the barmby & huchra sample are assigned to the dispersed component with a high velocity dispersion of 1407 , rather than to one of the individual clusters , this approach may tend to bias the cluster dispersions low .",
    "however , it is clearly more consistent in finding a mean redshift of @xmath30 for a2152 , much closer to that of the bcg , whereas previous studies found means 1015% lower , near the mean values for a2147 and a2151 .",
    "moreover , the lower velocity dispersions are more in line with the x - ray properties of these clusters , e.g. , the x - ray gas temperature in a2152 has been estimated from _ einstein _",
    "data to be @xmath31  kev ( white , jones , & forman 1997 ) . we note , however , that the latest tabulation by struble & rood ( 1999 ) lists @xmath32 and @xmath33  for a2152 from 62 velocities .",
    "the centroid of the x - ray emission associated with a2152 is not coincident the bcg but is about 21 east .",
    "its position is within 40  of a pair of bright early - type galaxies which the barmby & huchra redshift catalogue reveals to be at @xmath34 .",
    "each of these background galaxies is intrinsically @xmath3570% more luminous than the a2152 bcg ( using a relative k - correction of 0.11mag for ellipticals ) .",
    "we return to this point in   [ sec : disc ] .",
    "a2152 was observed as part of the deep @xmath2-band keck imaging study by blakeslee ( 1999 ) of the bcg halo regions in six nearby rich clusters .",
    "clusters were selected to have velocity dispersions similar to that of the coma cluster and to lie in the redshift range @xmath3610,00020,000 .",
    "these six were then observed because they were reachable during a single night in the northern spring .",
    "based on this dataset , blakeslee & metzger ( 1999 ) reported follow - up spectroscopy of a magnitude @xmath37 lensed arc located 27  from the center of the cd galaxy in abell 2124 .",
    "we have visually searched the dataset for other bright lensing candidates , based on proximity to the bcg , tangential orientation , and arc - like appearance .",
    "the only obvious bright candidate was an arc - like object in a2152 .",
    "we obtained follow - up keck spectroscopy for this object and the a2152 bcg / srg pair .",
    "the imaging observations have already been described in detail by blakeslee ( 1999 ) . here",
    "we summarize them and report new photometric results for the a2152 arclet .",
    "a2152 was imaged with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris , oke  1995 ) on the keck  ii telescope under photometric conditions .",
    "the image scale was 0211  pix@xmath6 , and the total integration was 2000s in the @xmath2  band .",
    "reductions were carried out using the vista package .",
    "the seeing in the final stacked image was an exceptional 053 .",
    "the photometry was calibrated to the cousins @xmath2  band using landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars ; the photometric zero point is accurate to better than 0.02  mag .",
    "figure  [ fig : img ] displays the a2152 keck lris image , a smaller portion of which was shown by blakeslee ( 1999 ) .",
    "the possible lensed galaxy ( galaxy `` a '' ) is located 252 from the center of the bcg at a position angle pa@xmath38114 .",
    "the major axis of the bcg is at @xmath39 at radii @xmath40 , where the ellipticity ( difference of the axis ratio from unity ) of the light distribution is @xmath41 . beyond this radius",
    "the bcg isophotes have significant overlap with those of the srg and they are sufficiently round that the angle is difficult to determine .",
    "the isophotes of the srg show significant twisting ; the pa of its major axis swings from @xmath42 at @xmath43 to @xmath44 by @xmath45 , while the ellipticity stays fairly constant around @xmath46 .",
    "all galaxies with known redshifts ( either from barmby & huchra or the present study ) are labeled in figure  [ fig : img ] .",
    "it is somewhat curious that of 7 galaxies ( including galaxy a ) in the central @xmath356  field of a rich cluster , only 3 turn out to be cluster members . as mentioned above ,",
    "the galaxy pair g1/g2 are in the background with redshifts of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . during our spectroscopic observation of the bcg / srg ( described in ",
    "[ sec : kinematics ] ) , the lris slit picked up the magnitude @xmath49 galaxy labeled g3 , which turns out to have @xmath50 .",
    "galaxy `` m '' is an a2152 member with a velocity within @xmath51  of the bcg ( barmby & huchra ) .",
    "the center of the x - ray emission in this field ( jones & forman 1999 ) is 20  from g2 and 50  from g1 and is also labeled in figure  [ fig : img ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : twoviews ] shows an enlarged view of galaxy a along with an isophotal contour map .",
    "the impression is that of a disk galaxy whose disk has been warped into an arc - like shape ( arguably through lensing , as we discuss in  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "the object is visible in our image for a length of about 15 .",
    "the measured full - width at half maximum along the minor axis is 067 , which would be about @xmath52 in the absence of atmospheric blurring .",
    "this translates to a metric size @xmath53  at the redshift of this object ( see below ) ; apparently it has a very compact nucleus .",
    "the total magnitude of a , corrected for 0.105  mag of @xmath2-band galactic extinction ( @xcite ) , is @xmath54 .",
    "our main measurement results are collected in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "the simplest and most important test of gravitational lensing is whether or not the supposed lensed object is actually in the background .",
    "thus , we obtained one 900s spectrum of galaxy a with lris on the keck  ii telescope on the night of 25  march 1999 ( ut ) .",
    "we used a 300 line grating and a 1  wide slit oriented at @xmath55 , approximately along the major axis of galaxy  a. the seeing was poor , about 18 , so the slit missed a good fraction of the light .",
    "the dispersion was 2.44  pix@xmath6 , and the effective resolution was about 10  (fwhm ) .",
    "halogen flats and arc - lamp exposures were taken for calibration . the lris configuration and",
    "iraf reductions were identical to those of blakeslee & metzger ( 1999 ) , except that no flux standard spectrum was obtained .",
    "figure  [ fig : arcspec ] shows the reduced 1-d spectrum of galaxy  a with the strongest emissions lines labeled at top and some absorption lines labeled at the bottom .",
    "the emission appeared to be confined to the central @xmath354   of the galaxy , so this is all that was extracted .",
    "the spectrum is of very high signal - to - noise ( it was not a  priori obvious , in the absence of spiral structure or any spectral information , that there whould be such strong features ) , and we determine the redshift to be @xmath56 .",
    "the object is therefore about 3.3 times more distant than the intervening a2152 cluster , and the lensing hypothesis remains viable .",
    "if unlensed , the absolute magnitude of a , with a k - correction of @xmath57  mag , would be @xmath58 ( for @xmath59 and @xmath60 ; @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) , or a luminosity of about 0.48@xmath64 ( e.g. , lin  1996 ) .",
    "the h@xmath4 emission line has an equivalent width of @xmath65 , corrected for [ ] emission .",
    "the h@xmath66 equivalent width is @xmath67 .",
    "the [ ] @xmath68 and [ ] @xmath69 lines have equivalent widths of @xmath70and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "thus , the emission is quite strong , but not too anomalous in comparison to many late - type spirals or irregulars ( e.g. , kennicutt 1992 ) .    although we do not have a good absolute flux calibration of the spectrum",
    ", we can roughly estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) from the h@xmath4 equivalent width and the @xmath2-band luminosity .",
    "we use the spectrophotometric synthesis results of fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa ( 1995 ) to calibrate the absolute flux in cousins  @xmath2 , which has an effective wavelength of 6588 .",
    "about 75% of the @xmath2-band light comes from the region of emission within the galaxy , and from the measured h@xmath4 equivalent width we obtain a flux @xmath72 ergs  s@xmath6  @xmath73 and a luminosity of @xmath74 @xmath75ergs  s@xmath6 ( @xmath76 ) . to estimate the internal extinction",
    ", we perform a makeshift relative flux calibration using the feige  110 spectrum from blakeslee & metzger ( 1999 ) and find an h@xmath4-to - h@xmath66 flux ratio of 4.25 ; assuming an unextincted value of 3.0 and the extinction curve of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) gives a correction at @xmath77 of a factor of 2.15 .",
    "this is close to the `` canonical '' correction of @xmath141mag for spirals ( e.g. , kennicutt 1992 ) but will yield a sfr 16% lower . finally , using the updated calibration from kennicutt ( 1998 ) , we find @xmath78yr@xmath6 , or @xmath79yr@xmath6 for a typical @xmath80 .",
    "though not qualifying as a `` starburst galaxy , '' the sfr is quite substantial for a 0.5@xmath81 galaxy .",
    "the quoted errorbar is approximate and reflects mainly the @xmath3530% scatter quoted by kennicutt .",
    "the calibration based on [ ] equivalent width yields nearly the same sfr for this galaxy .      with the intent of improving the constraints on the a2152 potential for the lensing models",
    ", we obtained three 1100s spectra of the bcg / srg pair with lris on 16  june 1999 .",
    "we again used a 1  wide slit but the 900/5500 grating , yielding a dispersion of 0.84 pix@xmath6 .",
    "the slit was oriented at @xmath82 in order to pass through the centers of the two galaxies .",
    "again , halogen flats and arc lamps were taken for calibration , and we also obtained spectra of the k4  iii velocity standard hd213947 .",
    "the spectra were processed , wavelength calibrated , and rectified using standard iraf routines .",
    "figure  [ fig : bcgspec ] displays the central 11 extracted from the reduced 2-d spectra . although the spectra are clearly very similar , the bcg exhibits a small amount of h@xmath66 emission that is absent from the srg . such optical line emission is quite common among central cluster galaxies , and may be associated with cluster `` cooling flows '' ( e.g. , crawford  1999 ) .",
    "this emission may therefore be evidence that the bcg is indeed at the center of the a2152 cluster potential and that the offset of the jones & forman ( 1999 ) x - ray position is due to contamination from a background x - ray source .",
    "the kinematical analysis of the data was performed within the midas package .",
    "first , the spectra were rebinned along the slit ( spatial direction ) in order to achieve a minimum signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of 30 per  at all radii .",
    "the s / n of the central pixels is higher .",
    "then the continuum was removed by a fifth order polynomial fit .",
    "finally we determined the velocity dispersion and rotational velocity as a function of radius with the fourier correlation quotient ( fcq ) method ( bender 1990 ) allowing only for a gaussian stellar velocity distribution .",
    "when we allowed for non - gaussian distributions and fitted for the higher - order moments , the results for the rotational velocity and dispersion were unchanged within the errors but showed slightly more scatter at the largest radii .",
    "the detailed fcq setup , such as continuum fit order , wavelength extraction and error estimation was optimized with monte carlo simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : vprofs ] shows the measured velocity and velocity dispersion profiles for the bcg and srg .",
    "note that the @xmath83 position angle is @xmath84 away from the major axis of the bcg , and so the profile is more appropriate to the minor axis . for the srg , the pa is closer to the major axis .",
    "both galaxies show significant rotation , and both rotate in the sense opposite to that of the combined bcg / srg system .",
    "although the velocity dispersions decline outward from the centers of the galaxies , the dispersion profile for the srg appears to flatten at a value of @xmath85  outside the central 3 .",
    "likewise , the bcg s velocity dispersion profile does not show a significant decrease for @xmath86 . as seen in the top panel of figure  [ fig : vprofs ] , the center of rotation in the bcg",
    "is offset by about 02 ( 1 lris pixel ) from the luminosity center ; this is likely due to a slight offset of the galaxy center within the slit .",
    "the mean velocities , rotational velocities , and central dispersions are tabulated along with our other results in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "we have estimated the total ( 1-sigma ) errors on the mean velocities to be @xmath87 , but this is dominated by zero - point calibration errors ( flexure , illumination of slit , etc . ) .",
    "however , the relative velocity of the bcg / srg pair is better determined at @xmath88 .",
    "this accords well with previous measurements of @xmath89  from tarenghi  ( 1979 ) and @xmath90  from wegner  ( 1999 ) ; less well with @xmath91  from davoust & considre ( 1995 ) .",
    "( the velocities used by barmby & huchra for these two galaxies come from tarenghi ) .",
    "central velocity dispersions have been measured previously for the bcg by oegerle & hoessel ( 1991 ) , who found @xmath92 , and by wegner  ( 1999 ) , who reported @xmath93 ; both results are in agreement with our much more precise value of @xmath94 . for the srg",
    ", we find a central dispersion of @xmath95 , while wegner  found @xmath96 .",
    "their significantly higher dispersion is likely due to the strong rotation in this galaxy , which these authors did not account for when extracting the spectrum of the central several arcseconds of the galaxy . finally , our bcg mean velocity is @xmath97 discrepant with the wegner  value , which is higher by 95 , but it agrees within the errors with the values from tarenghi  ( 1979 ) , oegerle & hoessel ( 1991 ) , and davoust & considre ( 1995 ) .",
    "no previous measurements of the rotation or dispersion profile in either galaxy could be found .    finally , as noted in ",
    "[ ssec : imaging ] , the lris slit picked up the magnitude @xmath98 galaxy labeled g3 in figure  [ fig : img ] .",
    "we find it to be in the background with a velocity @xmath99 .",
    "this is just @xmath100  less than the velocity of g1 and @xmath101 less than that of g2 .",
    "to model a2152 as a lens , we use a potential of the form ( blandford & kochanek 1987 ) @xmath102 , \\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the limit @xmath104 for the spherical case , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are angular size distances to the source and from the lens to the source , respectively , and @xmath107 defines a softening radius .",
    "an ellipticity parameter @xmath108 can be introduced through @xmath109 , where @xmath110 are coordinates aligned with the major and minor axes of the potential .",
    "this represents a softened isothermal sphere for @xmath111 and provides a fairly good representation of the dark halo potentials in the cores of clusters ( e.g. , mellier  1993 ; tyson  1998 ) .",
    "we use the more limited relation with a fixed power law because there are too few lensing constraints in this system to differentiate various potential profiles , and we have used only circularly symmetric potentials as there is little constraint on the ellipticity .    we explored four different simple models for the lensing potential .",
    "we included three terms in each of these models , corresponding to the smooth halo mass in the cluster and the masses associated with the bcg and srg .",
    "for the latter two components , we use analytic potentials to approximate the velocity dispersions measured in  [ sec : kinematics ] with a small core . in our model  1 ,",
    "the center of the cluster potential was fixed at the cd center with an asymptotic dispersion of @xmath112  as measured by barmby & huchra ( 1998 ) and a softened core radius of 10 .",
    "model 2 also fixes the cluster potential at the bcg , but uses the higher dispersion estimate of 1340  ( struble & rood 1999 ) .",
    "models 3 and 4 are the same as models 1 and 2 , but fix the cluster potential center at the x - ray center ( while of course keeping the bcg and srg model components fixed ) . within each model",
    ", we also explored a range of core softening radii .",
    "our primary constraints for the lens models are the radius , size , and orientation of galaxy  a. the modest distortion and lack of a counterarc suggests a source position that lies outside the tangential and radial caustics ( e.g. , grossman & narayan 1988 ) and whose image lies outside the critical curve .",
    "these constraints quickly rule out model  2 in most forms : with a small core radius , the critical curve for @xmath113 lies at around 35 arcsec , well outside the galaxy radius .",
    "this would imply multiple images and large distortions for galaxy a. even with a large core radius , the effective radial magnification becomes large and can be ruled out by the lens appearance .",
    "model 3 does not produce significant magnification or distortion for the galaxy ; thus under such a model , the arc - like shape would need to be intrinsic .",
    "model 4 produces shear and magnification at the position of galaxy a , but the shear direction is not directed tangential to the bcg , as observed in galaxy a.    model 1 , however , produces modest magnification and distortion of a @xmath113 source with a shear aligned tangentially to the bcg / cluster . a family of models with a range of core radii and asymptotic dispersions for the primary lens ( cluster dark matter ) can reproduce the characteristics of the arc .",
    "these models are degenerate in @xmath103 and @xmath107 for determining the mass enclosed within the arc radius .",
    "model 1 fits within this family of models .",
    "figure  [ fig : lensmod ] shows the predicted magnifications from model  1 with a 10  core as a function of observed source position .",
    "the position of galaxy a implies a magnification of @xmath114 , dropping to @xmath115 for a model with a 40  soft core .",
    "given this model , we can ask what the intrinsic source shape of galaxy a would be ; figure  [ fig : lensmap ] shows contours of the observed galaxy surface brightness along with the same contours mapped back to the source plane via the lens equation .",
    "the implied shape is that of a fairly symmetric galaxy with a disk and dominant bulge , with no indication of a warp .    while we can not make quantitative estimates of cluster mass parameters with a single lensed galaxy , we find that a simple model constructed from a low - dispersion cluster centered at the bcg can produce the shear needed to explain the curved shape of the background galaxy from a more symmetric source . indeed , galaxy a must be distorted in some fashion by the foreground cluster , and we can rule out two of our other three plausible models based on the implied lensing geometry .",
    "we can not , however , rule out a low - dispersion cluster mass centered on the x - ray center from lensing alone , although this would mean galaxy  a must be intrinsically warped .",
    "another galaxy with an unusual shape , elongated _ radially _ from the bcg center , is visible about 11  to the east of the bcg ( see the upper panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : twoviews ] ) and lies near some critical radii of model  1 . if in the background , this galaxy may provide much better constraints on the shape of the inner potential , however the redshift is unknown and we do not attempt to model it here .",
    "deep @xmath2-band keck imaging taken under excellent seeing conditions has revealed a curved object 252 ( 15 ) from the center of the a2152 bcg , along the major axis .",
    "the reddening - corrected @xmath2  magnitude of this `` arc '' is @xmath116 , and follow - up spectroscopy shows that it lies at a redshift @xmath56 .",
    "its position , orientation , and redshift all suggest a lensing explanation for the curiously bowed structure .",
    "the object has numerous strong emission lines , and the equivalent width of h@xmath4 is @xmath117  , from which we infer a star formation rate of @xmath118yr@xmath6 .",
    "we have presented spatially resolved spectroscopy of the a2152 bcg and srg , which are separated by 47  and are together catalogued as ugc10187 .",
    "the relative velocity of the bcg and srg is @xmath119 , and both galaxies show significant rotation .",
    "the rotational velocities along the observed position angle are @xmath120  and @xmath121  for the bcg and srg , respectively .",
    "our velocity dispersion profile for the bcg extends to a radius of @xmath122 ( 9.5 ) , about 60% of the way to the radial position of the lensed galaxy .",
    "we have modeled the lensing potential of a2152 using constraints from the measured cluster velocity dispersion of 715 and our own stellar velocity dispersion measurements for the bcg and srg .",
    "the models can not produce a significant lensing effect on galaxy a if the a2152 potential center is taken to coincide with the peak of the overall x - ray emission . however , if the potential center is taken to be the a2152 bcg , then the models _ can _ reproduce the observed position and apparent bowed shape of the galaxy , and the implied magnification is a factor of about 1.9 .",
    "conversely , we can say that if the object is significantly lensed , then the 21 offset of the x - ray centroid from the bcg is due to contamination from another source of x - ray emission .",
    "we note that both the cluster velocity dispersion and the core softening radius in our lensing model is degenerate with the source position .",
    "however , the higher values that have been reported for the dispersion ( see  [ sec : clusprops ] ) , if centered on the bcg , produce lens models with critical curves that lie outside of the lensed galaxy , thus multiple images would be expected of any background galaxy at the position and redshift of a. we can therefore rule out this case from a lensing argument ; even a large core radius model would produce significantly more distortion in a @xmath113 galaxy .",
    "the available redshift data provide evidence for a background association of early - type galaxies at @xmath123 , projected near the center of a2152 .",
    "two of the galaxies , which we call g1/g2 , have redshifts from the barmby & huchra ( 1998 ) catalogue .",
    "they are separated by 30   and are each about 70% more luminous than the a2152 bcg .",
    "the third galaxy , called g3 , is 35  southeast of the a2152 bcg and was picked up by the lris slit during our observations .",
    "it is 116from g1 and 132  from g2 , or metric distances of 188 - 215 .",
    "the velocity range for these three galaxies is @xmath101 .",
    "while three galaxies do not a cluster make , the luminosities , velocities , and early - type morphologies of the galaxies are highly suggestive .",
    "moreover , there is a strong concentration of small galaxies of unknown redshift centered near the bright g1/g2 pair .",
    "it is highly likely that some of the x - ray emission , which is centered just 20  from g2 , could be due to a grouping of galaxies associated with g1/g2 .",
    "therefore , the center of the true a2152 x - ray emission , and the center of the a2152 cluster potential , might well coincide with the a2152 bcg , as required by our lensing models .",
    "we note that the centers of the outermost x - ray contours in the jones & forman map of this field drift away from g1/g2 and closer to the a2152 bcg ; the optical h@xmath66 emission we find in the bcg spectrum may be additional circumstantial evidence for central location in the cluster potential .",
    "however , a high - resolution x - ray map is needed to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "if there is a background cluster , galaxy  a may well be a member , in which case it would be falling away from us through the cluster with a velocity of @xmath124 .",
    "simulations show that the tidal effects of clusters on infalling galaxies can warp spiral disks into arc - like shapes ( moore  1999a ) and even form giant arcs of tidal debris ( calcneo - roldn  2000 ) .",
    "thus , tidal interaction with a local cluster potential , rather than lensing by the foreground a2152 potential , could be responsible for the distorted appearance of the galaxy , as well as for the observed strong star formation",
    ". its location and orientation with respect to the a2152 bcg would then be merely fortuitous .",
    "however , the galaxy in question would have to be caught during its initial pass through the cluster , since gas in cluster galaxies tends to be lost on relatively short time - scales , truncating the star formation ( e.g. , balogh  1998 ; kodama & bower 2000 ) .",
    "the probability that galaxy a is a member of a cluster at @xmath8 depends of course on the velocity dispersion of the cluster . a deep redshift survey of this field is needed to discern whether or not there is a very substantial background cluster ( as suggested by the luminosities of g1/g2 and the position of the x - ray center in this field ) , and how likely galaxy a s membership is .",
    "such a redshift survey would need to go at least @xmath125  mag fainter than the barmby & huchra ( 1998 ) limit in order to pick up the multitude of small galaxies that lie between the a2152 bcg / srg pair and the g1/g2 background pair .",
    "although superficially a2152 might have seemed an unremarkable low - redshift cluster ( leaving aside the unlikely velocity dispersions in excess 1300  found in the literature ) , our photometric and spectroscopic observations of its central field have raised a host of intriguing new questions about this cluster and the arc - shaped galaxy projected near its bcg .",
    "how much mass is there along this line of sight and how is it distributed ?",
    "is the a2152 bcg actually at the center of the cluster potential and the observed offset with respect to the x - ray center due to the superposed emission of a background cluster at @xmath8 ?",
    "if so , is the distorted galaxy a member which is being distorted by the hypothetical background cluster , or is it a field galaxy being lensed by a2152 ?",
    "along with high - resolution x - ray observations and a deep redshift survey , a weak lensing analysis of this field would help in unraveling the projected mass distribution and provide insight into these questions .",
    "we believe that the weight of the evidence favors the view that the a2152 bcg is at the center of its cluster s potential and is significantly lensing galaxy a. further lensed objects , if present near critical curves , could provide useful future constraints on the central structure of rich clusters . for now , however , a complete understanding of this system and definitive answers to the questions raised by this study must await an infusion of new data .",
