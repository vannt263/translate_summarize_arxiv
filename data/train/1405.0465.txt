    "the detection by the hess galactic plane survey @xcite of @xmath5  ev radiation coming from the diffuse remains of supernovae has opened up a new window on the evolution of these energetic stellar remnants .",
    "more than 2/3 of the @xmath6 galactic tev sources are supernova remnants ( snrs ) or pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , the latter being the most numerous class .",
    "high - energy radiation from pwne is produced as a result of the interaction of the pulsar wind with the surrounding medium .",
    "many young pwne are found inside shell snrs , where the emission begins at a termination shock situated close to the pulsar .",
    "downstream of the shock the relativistic electrons radiate synchrotron photons from radio through x - rays .",
    "the same electrons up - scatter ambient photons , creating a second , broad spectral peak in the @xmath0-ray band .",
    "some snr shells also emit high - energy @xmath0-rays , although the dominant mechanism there is less clear .",
    "one possibility is the hadronic scenario , decay of @xmath7 mesons created in collisions between shock accelerated cosmic - ray protons and thermal gas .",
    "however , leptonic models involving inverse compton scattering of ambient photons are also invoked ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite is coincident with , a shell - type , @xmath8 diameter snr @xcite .",
    "the tev emission was described as resolved , but centrally peaked .",
    "deeper observations @xcite show a more extended source than first reported , with gaussian @xmath9 = @xmath10 and a flux above 200  gev of @xmath11  erg  @xmath12  s@xmath13 . based on 21  cm absorption spectra to  and adjacent regions ,",
    "@xcite concluded that the distance to  is in the range @xmath14  kpc , which makes the most luminous tev source in the galaxy , with @xmath15  erg  s@xmath13 .",
    "an _ xmm - newton _  observation by @xcite identified a highly absorbed x - ray point source coincident with the hess  source with clear indication of extended emission .",
    "the x - ray components were subsequently well resolved by _",

    "no x - ray emission is detected from the snr shell , probably because of its low temperature and large intervening column density , @xmath16  @xmath12 .",
    "the power - law spectrum of the _ chandra _  point source , with photon index @xmath17 , is consistent with a pulsar origin .",
    "the compact x - ray pwn is @xmath18 in diameter , smaller than the tev source , while its spectral index , @xmath19 , is much steeper than that of the pulsar .",
    "its spectrum steepens further in the outer parts , which is evidence of synchrotron aging .",
    "no radio counterpart to the x - ray pwn is detected in high - resolution images of  using the gmrt at 235 , 610 , or 1280  mhz , and atca maps at 1290 and 2300  mhz , and no radio pulsations were found by the gmrt at 610 and 1280  mhz @xcite .",

    "their derived gev spectrum is not cut off as would be the case for magnetospheric pulsar emission , but is continuous with the hess spectrum .",
    "in contrast , @xcite interpreted the joint _ fermi_/hess spectrum and revised tev extent in terms of hadronic emission from a portion of the snr shell interacting with dense interstellar gas .",
    "more recent analyses of additional _ fermi _  data @xcite show less flux than @xcite found , and the revision will affect both models .    in this paper , we present the discovery of x - ray pulsations from /  in data acquired as part of the _ nustar _  survey of the norma arm region of the galactic plane @xcite , and a follow - up observation to determine the pulsar s energetics .",

    "@xcite estimated an electron density of 100165  @xmath109 for the western and northern part of the snr shell by assuming that the low - energy turnover of its radio spectrum is due to local free - free absorption .",
    "they also searched the nanten co survey data for molecular gas that could be target material for hadronic production of @xmath0-rays from protons accelerated in the snr shell , but did not find any that could be associated with .",
    "@xcite present a model in which the tev emission is produced by hadronic interactions in the north and west part of the snr shell .",
    "it is motivated largely by the continuity of the @xcite _ fermi _  spectrum with the hess spectrum , which they argue is difficult to fit in a pwn model , and also by the overlap of the tev source with the side of the snr shell that is adjacent to regions .",
    "they require a high ambient density of 150  @xmath109 to reproduce the gev / tev spectrum , but a small density to account for the size of the snr shell .",
    "these are achieved by assuming that the explosion occurred inside a wind - blown bubble of the progenitor star , of average density 0.1  @xmath109 , which is then consistent with their assumed age of 2500  yr .",
    "as they remark , the model requires a large fraction of the sn energy to be channeled into cosmic rays , especially since only one side of the snr contributes to this process .",
    "however , they overestimated the integrated @xmath110  tev flux of hess  by a factor of @xmath111 due to a numerical error , which relieves the efficiency requirement somewhat .",

    "this is why we use different _ fermi _  results in our own model , which contributes to the diverging conclusions of the two papers .",
    "@xcite modeled the @xmath0-ray emission from hess  and the associated broad - band spectrum with an evolving , one - zone pwn model , where the @xmath0-rays are ambient photons inverse compton scattered by the relativistic electrons that also produce the synchrotron emission .",
