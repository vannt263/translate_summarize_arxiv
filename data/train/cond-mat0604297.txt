    "the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) is defined as the adiabatic temperature change ( @xmath1 ) or isothermal entropy change ( @xmath2 ) of magnetic materials with the application of an external magnetic field .",
    "mce has immense technological importance for magnetic cooling . in recent years",
    "the studies related with mce has gained momentum due to the observation of giant mce near room temperature @xcite .",
    "the main focus in the study of mce is concentrated to find out newer materials with large mce .",
    "apart from its technological importance , the mce can give us valuable basic information about the magnetic materials like nature of magnetic ordering , metamagnetic transitions etc @xcite .",
    "the building block of ferromagnetic materials below ordering temperature are the magnetic domains which are separated by domain walls .",
    "mce is related with the thermomagnetic properties of magnetic materials .",
    "therefore magnetic domains as well as domain walls is expected to have effect on mce .",
    "however the contribution of domain wall on mce is not properly highlighted in the literature .",
    "polycrystalline gdpt@xmath0 compound crystallizes in a stable cubic mgcu@xmath0 structure with ferromagnetic curie temperature 31 k @xcite . in this present work ,",
    "the main objective is to find out how strong is the contribution of domain wall on mce in gdpt@xmath0 .",
    "can it influence the temperature dependence of mce so much that it leaves some strong signature in the dependence .",
    "gadolinium , having @xmath5 , has negligible crystalline electric field in gdpt@xmath0 and should reach it s full moment value upon ordering and attain its full magnetic entropy value @xmath6 or 17.3 j / mol k. due to large moment of gadolinium , gdpt@xmath0 is expected to show reasonably large mce .",
    "the magnetic and transport properties of gdpt@xmath0 compound have been studied by various authors @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the magnetic interaction of well - localized 4f magnetic moment of gd are mediated by conduction electrons via rkky interaction .",
    "critical behavior of electrical resistivity was studied in the vicinity of the ordering temperature in the framework of the molecular field theory @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge no report on the study of thermodynamic property of gdpt@xmath0 compound is available in the literature .",
    "we have studied mce as well as magnetotransport properties of gdpt@xmath0 .",
    "earlier reports @xcite in the literature suggest that the dependence of magnetocaloric effect and magnetoresistance can be similar .",
    "the comparison of the thermodynamic and magnetotransport data is a novel method of gaining deeper understanding about magnetic materials . keeping this context in mind ,",
    "we have measured and compared the temperature dependence of different quantities @xmath3 and @xmath2 , one related with transport and the other related with thermodynamic properties .",
    "the binary polycrystalline sample was prepared by arc melting of constituent elements of purity better than 99.9@xmath7 in argon atmosphere .",
    "x - ray diffraction pattern confirms the single - phase nature of the compound which crystallizes in cubic mgcu@xmath0 structure . specific heat ( c ) measurements were performed using the semi - adiabatic heat - pulse method in the temperature interval 4 - 60 k in the presence of 10 and 70 koe magnetic fields .",
    "the temperature interval of zero - field c measurement was 4 - 130 k. the temperature interval of c measurement in 5 koe was 4 - 40 k. the temperature dependence of resistivity(@xmath8 ) in the absence of a field as well as in the presence of 5 , 10 and 70 koe magnetic fields were measured by the conventional four - probe method .",
    "the longitudinal magnetoresistance ( mr ) @xmath9 measurements at 4 , 10 , 20 , 40 and 80 k were carried out in the magnetic field up to 75 koe .",
    "the specific heat of gdpt@xmath0 as a function of temperature at various constant magnetic field is plotted in fig.1 .    in the presence of small external magnetic field ( @xmath1010 koe ) the peak position of c shifts to the higher temperature , indicating the ferromagnetic nature of magnetic ordering . at higher magnetic field",
    "i.e. in 70 koe field , the peak disappears completely .    to find out the magnetic contribution of specific heat",
    "we have fitted the zero - field c data using debye integral along with linear contribution within the temperature interval 80 to 130 k and extrapolated the fitted data down to low temperature which is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the total specific heat c can be expressed as , @xmath11 c@xmath12 is the magnetic part of specific heat .",
    "c@xmath13 and c@xmath14 are respectively the electronic and phonon contribution of specific heat .",
    "the electronic part is of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the electronic heat capacity coefficient .",
    "the phonon part , approximated as debye model , is of the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the debye function and @xmath19 is the debye temperature .",
    "the c data was fitted using @xmath20 in the temperature interval 80 to 130 k under the approximation that well above the transition temperature magnetic contribution is negligibly small . from fitting ,",
    "the value of @xmath16 and @xmath19 turns out to be 2.2 mj / mol k@xmath21 and 215 k respectively",
    ". magnetic contribution of specific heat was obtained by subtracting the regenerated nonmagnetic contribution in the temperature range 4 to 130 k using the above mentioned @xmath16 and @xmath19 value .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath22 is shown in the inset of fig.2 . from the inflection point of @xmath22 data",
    ", we obtained the ferromagnetic ordering temperature @xmath23 k which is close to the referred transition temperature @xmath24 k @xcite from magnetization measurement .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath22 reaches 20.54 j / mol k. the magnetic contribution to the specific heat for equal - moment ( em ) magnetic structure in gd intermetallic compounds is expressed as @xcite @xmath25 gadolinium having j=7/2 , yield @xmath26",
    "j / mol k. our experimentally observed value of @xmath22 which is very close to the @xmath27 value indicates that the magnetic configuration in gdpt@xmath0 is equal - moment in nature .",
    "moreover a noticeable magnetic contribution persists well above the transition temperature .",
    "the magnetic entropy of gd intermetallic compounds attain its full value @xmath28 or 17.3 j / mol k just above the ordering temperature @xcite .",
    "the calculated magnetic entropy of our sample is 17.6 j / mol k at the ordering temperature which is in good agreement with @xmath29 or 17.3 j / mol k. this indicate that the gd ions ordered with full moments within gdpt@xmath0 .",
    "the isothermal entropy change ( @xmath2 ) and adiabatic temperature change ( @xmath1 ) was obtained from total entropy , which was calculated from experimental c data as a function of temperature at various constant magnetic fields . to calculate the entropy contribution for 0 to 4 k ,",
    "the linear variation of c data was considered .",
    "the difference between the two entropy curves from zero - field to in field for isothermal translation results in @xmath2 and isentropic subtraction gives @xmath1 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath1 for 5 , 10 and 70 koe magnetic fields are plotted in fig.3 and fig.4 respectively .    the plot of @xmath1 as a function of temperature shows a positive caret - like shape with maxima around the magnetic ordering temperature and @xmath1 positive in the entire temperature range for all magnetic fields , which is expected for ferromagnetic materials .",
    "the temperature dependence of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are almost similar to each other . the value of @xmath1 around the magnetic ordering temperature for 5 , 10 and 70 koe magnetic fields are respectively 0.8 , 1.4 and 6.3 k i.e. the rate of change of @xmath1 as a function of magnetic field decreases with increasing fields .",
    "this feature also indicate the ferromagnetic nature of gdpt@xmath0 compounds .    the temperature dependence of @xmath3 is shown in fig.5 which was calculated from experimental resistivity data from 4 to 60 k at various constant magnetic fields . below the magnetic ordering temperature the variation of @xmath3 and @xmath1 or @xmath2 with temperature are distinctly different for all the three magnetic fields 5 , 10 and 70 koe . it has been shown earlier that the temperature dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath2 can be similar @xcite .",
    "it implies that for a ferromagnetic compound with the increasing ( decreasing ) magnitude of @xmath2 the magnitude of @xmath3 is expected to increase ( decrease ) as a function of temperature . as a result",
    "one can expect that @xmath3 decreases gradually as does @xmath2 with decreasing temperature after showing a maxima around ferromagnetic transition temperature of gdpt@xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to the expectation , @xmath3 shows a broad hump at low temperature . to find out the main cause behind the dissimilar behavior between @xmath3 and mce we have performed mr measurement as function of field at different constant temperatures , which is shown in fig.6(a ) .",
    "the mr curves at constant temperature clearly demonstrate the existence of significant low field magnetoresistance ( lfmr ) originating from magnetic domain wall at low temperature . in the paramagnetic state the low field",
    "mr vanishes and at higher temperature i.e. at 80 k mr follows -@xmath30 magnetic field dependence as indicated by dashed line in fig.6(a ) , which is an indication of enhanced spin fluctuation even at this high temperature .",
    "the lfmr value was obtained by extrapolating 5 koe data to zero field which is shown in fig.6(b ) .",
    "the lfmr below ferromagnetic ordering temperature of polycrystalline compounds originates due to the suppression of domain wall scattering of conduction electrons with the application of magnetic field .",
    "domain wall contribution of mr in gdpt@xmath0 remains unchanged below 10 k and absent above the ferromagnetic transition temperature . in the intermediate temperatures it varies almost linearly as a function of temperature . after removing the domain wall contribution from the total resistivity difference the broad hump in @xmath3 vanishes which is shown in fig.5 by dashed line and the nature of @xmath3 and @xmath2 curves as a function of temperature comes out to be similar .",
    "these observation indicates that the dissimilar temperature dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath2 in gdpt@xmath0 is originating from the fact that the magnetic domain wall has significant contribution in @xmath31 but negligible influence on mce .",
    "mce along with transport property have been studied in gdpt@xmath0 compound .",
    "we have observed distinct difference in temperature dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath2 below the ferromagnetic ordering temperature . however",
    "if we remove the domain wall contribution from @xmath3 , then the nature of @xmath3 and @xmath2 curves as a function of temperature are similar .",
    "it highlights the fact that the domain wall contribution in magnetocaloric effect is negligible in spite of the fact that it has significant contribution in transport in gdpt@xmath0 .",
