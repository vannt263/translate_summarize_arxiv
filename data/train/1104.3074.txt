    ". use the functional principal components and the functional linear model as exploratory tools .",
    "another example of this type is the australian rainfall data set , recently used by , which consists of daily rainfall measurements from 1840 to 1990 at 191 australian weather stations . due to the importance of such data structures",
    "it is useful to investigate when the commonly used techniques designed for iid functional data retain their consistency for spatially distributed data , and when they fail .",
    "we establish conditions for consistency , or lack thereof , for the functional mean and the functional principal components .",
    "our conditions combine the spatial dependence of the curves @xmath5 and the distribution of the data locations @xmath3 .",
    "it is hoped that the general framework we propose will be useful in the development of asymptotic arguments for statistical models involving spatial functional data .",
    "an important example of data that fall into our framework are pollution curves : @xmath6 is the concentration of a pollutant at time @xmath7 at location @xmath3 .",
    "data of this type were studied by",
    ". a functional framework might be convenient because such data are typically available only at sparsely distributed time points @xmath8 which can be different at different locations .",
    "another interesting example are snow water curves measured at several dozen locations in every state over many decades .",
    "such data have been studied in the spatial framework , e.g. and , but useful insights can be gained by studying the whole curves reflecting the temporal dynamics . in many studies , @xmath6 is the count at time @xmath7 of disease cases , where @xmath3 represents an average location in an areal model .",

    "top to bottom ( latitude in parentheses ) : yakutsk ( 62.0 ) , yamagawa ( 31.2 ) , manila ( 14.7 ) .",
    "the functions must be divided by a deterministic function of the latitude to obtain a stationary field .    the data set that most directly motivated this research consists of the curves of the so  called f2-layer critical frequency @xmath9 .",
    "three such curves are shown in figure [ f : fof2 ] . in principle , @xmath9 curves are available at close to 200 locations throughout the globe , but sufficiently complete data are available at only 30 - 40 locations which are very unevenly spread ; for example , there is a dense network of observatories over europe and practically no data over the oceans .",
    "the study of this data set has been motivated by the hypothesis of who suggested that the increasing amounts of greenhouse gases should lead to global cooling in mesosphere and thermosphere , as opposed to the global warming in lower troposphere . pointed out that such cooling would result in a thermal contraction and the global lowering of the ionospheric peak densities , which can be computed from the critical frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the last twenty years have seen very extensive research in this area , see for a partial overview .",
    "one of the difficulties is in finding a global trend for curves which appear to exhibit trends in opposing directions over various regions .",
    "stressed that to make any trends believable , a suitable statistical modeling , and a proper treatment of `` errors and uncertainties '' is called for .",
    "space physics data measured at terrestrial observatories always come in the form of temporal curves at fixed spatial locations .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) used the tools of functional data analysis to study such data , but the spatial dependence of the curves was not fully exploited .",
    "there has not been much research on fundamental properties of spatially distributed functional data .",
    "review recent contributions to the methodology for spatially distributed functional data . for geostatistical functional data , several exploratory approaches to kriging have been proposed .",
    "typically fixed basis expansions are used , see and .",
    "a general theoretical framework has to address several problems .",
    "the first issue is the dimensionality of the index space .",
    "while in time series analysis , the process is indexed by an equispaced scalar parameter , we need here a @xmath10-dimensional index space . for model building",
    "this makes a big difference since the dynamics and dependence of the process have to be described in all directions , and the typical recurrence equations used in time series can not be employed .",
    "the model building is further complicated by the fact that the index space is often continuous ( geostatistical data ) . rather than defining a random field @xmath11 via a specific model equations ,",
    "dependence conditions are imposed , in terms of the decay of the covariances or using mixing conditions .",
    "another feature peculiar to random field theory is the design of the sampling points ; the distances between them play a fundamental role .",
    "different asymptotics hold in the presense of clusters and for sparsely distributed points .",
    "at least three types of point distributions have been considered ( ): when the region @xmath12 where the points @xmath13 are sampled remains bounded , then we are in the so - called _ infill domain sampling _ case .",
    "classical asymptotic results , like the law of large numbers or the central limit theorem will usually fail , see .",
    "the other extreme situation is described by the _ increasing domain sampling_. here a minimum separation between the sampling points @xmath14 for all @xmath15 and @xmath16 is required .",
    "this is of course only possible if @xmath17 .",
    "we shall also explore the _ nearly infill _ situation studied by and . in this case",
    "the domain of the sampling region becomes unbounded ( @xmath18 ) , but at the same time the number of sites in any given subregion tends to infinity , i.e.  the points become more dense .",
    "these issues are also studied by , , , .",
    "we formalize these concepts in sections [ s : ma ] and [ s : designs ] .",
    "finally , the interplay of the geostatistical spatial structure and the functional temporal structure must be cast into a workable framework .    for the reasons explained above , the approach of , who developed a framework for estimation and testing for functional time series is totally inappropriate for functional spatial fields .",
    "the starting point for the theory of is the representation @xmath19 of a function @xmath20 in terms of iid error functions @xmath21 .",
    "while all time series models used in practice admit such a representation , no analog representations exist for geostatistical spatial data .",
    "( even though not widely used , spatial autoregressive processes have been proposed , but no volterra type expansions have been developed for them . )    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s : me ] describes in greater detail the objectives of this research by developing several examples which show how spatially distributed functional data differ from functional random samples and from functional time series . in simple settings",
    ", it illustrates what kind of consistency or inconsistency results can be expected , and what kind of difficulties must be overcome .",
    "assumptions on the functional random fields we study are introduced in section [ s : ma ] .",
    "a crucial part of these assumptions consists of conditions on the spatial distribution of the points @xmath3 .",
    "section [ s : designs ] compares our conditions to those typically assumed for scalar spatial processes . in sections [ s : cm ] and [ s :",
    "cc ] we establish consistency results , respectively , for the functional mean and the covariance operator .",

    "section [ s : example ] explains , by means of general theorems and examples , when the sample principal components are not consistent .",
    "the proofs of the main results are collected in section [ s : p - cm ] .",
    "functional principal components play a fundamental role in functional data analysis , much greater than the usual multivariate principal components .",
    "this is mostly due to the fact that the karhunen - love expansion allows to represent functional data in a concise way .",
    "this property has been extensively used and studied in various settings . to name only a few illustrative references ,",
    "we cite , , , , , and . depending on the structure of the data ,",

    "a solution is to perform the principal component analysis on transformed data which admits a sparse representation .",

    "representation is thus the most natural and convenient model for spatially distributed functional data .",
    "more generally , the mean @xmath83 may itself depend on the spatial location @xmath48 , but in this paper we study spatially stationary random fields .",
