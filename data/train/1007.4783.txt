    "calculations of the baryon asymmetry of the universe require the description of @xmath0-violating processes in a finite - density background .",
    "conventionally , semi - classical boltzmann equations are employed , where one computes the evolution of classical particle number densities in the presence of scattering processes , that are given by matrix elements from the in - out formalism .",
    "since @xmath0 violation in these matrix elements is a higher order effect that is typically induced by loop diagrams , where particles in the loop are kinematically allowed to be on shell , this approach bears notorious difficulties concerning the correct counting : is a certain process higher order or is it a combination of two leading order processes , that are already accounted for in the boltzmann equations ? for the @xmath0-violating processes in baryogenesis , a way of addressing this caveat is the method of real intermediate state ( ris ) subtraction  @xcite .    a more direct and systematic way to deal with this counting problem",
    "is to avoid the detour via the in - out matrix elements and instead to formulate the problem directly in terms of green functions .",
    "a method that achieves this is given in terms of the closed time path ( ctp ) or in - in formalism  @xcite , which has been successfully applied to various models of baryogenesis including also a realistic scenario of leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "the set of green functions that are computed in the ctp framework encompasses both , the spectral and the statistical information of the system . to leading accuracy in a weakly interacting situation ,",
    "it is often sufficient to approximate the spectral functions by on - shell @xmath1-functions , while the statistical contributions encode the distribution functions of quasi - particles . in this way ,",
    "the kinetic equations that govern leptogenesis have been recovered systematically and additional corrections due to the full quantum statistical distributions of right - handed neutrinos and the leptons and higgs boson of the standard model have been derived  @xcite .    the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite is for a single flavour of standard model leptons @xmath2 , which is appropriate in those situations where the different standard model yukawa couplings of these flavours are negligible , because an asymmetry is only produced for one particular linear combination of the lepton flavours .",
    "however , at smaller temperatures , when the lepton yukawa couplings @xmath3 of the standard model approach equilibrium , the flavour degeneracy is broken and effects of flavour have to be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the derivation of a set of kinetic equations from non - equilibrium quantum field theory , which covers both the unflavoured and fully flavoured regimes , and is valid in between , is still missing up to now , and is the subject of this paper .    a simple model that encompasses the salient features of flavoured leptogenesis and which we consider in the present work is specified by the lagrangian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the four - component majorana spinor representing the right handed singlet neutrino @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the spinor for the @xmath8 doublet of left handed standard model leptons @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the flavour index , and @xmath11 are the corresponding charged right handed leptons .",
    "the @xmath8 doublet of higgs fields is represented by @xmath12 , and we define @xmath13 with @xmath14 the antisymmetric @xmath15 matrix in the @xmath8 indices with @xmath16 . for simplicity , we assume @xmath17 .",
    "the generalisation to more than two right handed neutrinos @xmath6 is straightforward .",
    "single - flavour calculations for leptogenesis can be easily generalised to the multi - flavour situation , provided there is a flavour basis in which one can express the lepton - number densities of the several flavours and at the same time neglect possible correlations between the different flavours .",
    "when the lepton yukawa couplings are fully in equilibrium , the appropriate flavour basis is where these couplings @xmath3 are diagonal . in contrast , in the unflavoured regime the appropriate basis is determined by the linear combination , in which the lepton asymmetry is produced .",
    "these considerations raise the following questions : first , is there a kinetic equation that is manifestly covariant under the choice of the flavour basis ? and second , can such an equation also deal with the intermediate regime where the couplings @xmath3 are not yet in full equilibrium but are non - negligible at the same time ?",
    "the latter point is of particular importance since leptogenesis is a process that takes a finite amount of time while temperature is decreasing , such that the flavour - sensitive interactions may be out of equilibrium initially , but equilibrate at later times .",
    "clearly , in order to address this question , one has to promote the set of lepton number distributions within a certain flavour basis to a matrix , that also allows for off - diagonal flavour correlations . in a heuristic approach , by appealing to the hamiltonian evolution of a density matrix , such a set of equations has been proposed  @xcite , and numerical solutions to these equations have been obtained  @xcite .    on the other hand , it is clear that the green functions within the ctp formalism allow for the possibility of off - diagonal correlations in a straightforward way .",
    "indeed , once the appropriate kadanoff - baym equations for unflavoured leptogenesis are known  @xcite , the multi - flavour generalisation is easily written down",
    ". however , the kadanoff - baym equations are a coupled set of integro - differential equations that needs to be subjected to some analytic approximations before solving it numerically .",
    "key simplifications are first the gradient expansion , which effectively is an expansion in terms of time derivatives , in deviations of the distribution functions from equilibrium , and in the small coupling constants .",
    "second , one makes use of a separation of time scales between the interactions induced by the small yukawa couplings @xmath18 and @xmath3 and the faster gauge interactions , that maintain kinetic equilibrium and induce lepton - antilepton pair creation and annihilation processes .",
    "this allows to describe the distribution functions by generalised chemical potentials .",
    "the application of these strategies of simplification to the multi - flavour case constitutes the main body of the present work . in section  [ section : flavlep ] , we set up the multi - flavour kadanoff - baym equations and show that the flavour - dependent dispersion relations for the leptons , that are induced by the right handed neutrino and yukawa couplings @xmath18 and @xmath3 , respectively , give rise to commutator terms in the kinetic equations which are also characteristic of flavour oscillations in the presence of tree - level mass terms",
    ". in section  [ sec : kinetic ] , we make use of the short time scale for kinetic equilibration in order to express the lepton densities in terms of a generalised chemical potential .",
    "we show that the gauge interactions in addition to enforcing kinetic equilibrium damp the flavour oscillations and that parametrically , flavoured leptogenesis is in the overdamped regime .",
    "the processes that turn out to dominate the decay of the off - diagonal flavour correlations are the flavour - sensitive three - body scatterings through the couplings @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the hermitian matrix of lepton charge densities , including flavour off - diagonal correlations , which is defined more precisely below .",
    "the main result of the present work is the kinetic evolution equation @xmath20 + 2 s_{ab } -\\gamma_{\\ell ab}^{\\rm fl } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath21 denotes the conformal time , which is related to the physical comoving time through @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the scale factor of the expanding universe .",
    "the matrices @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are all hermitian .",
    "lepton number and @xmath0-violating source terms are represented by @xmath25 , @xmath24 encompasses the washout rates for the various lepton flavours , and @xmath26 is the matrix of flavour - sensitive damping rates . in case we impose that @xmath19 is evaluated in the basis of mass eigenstates of leptonic quasi - particles , the anti - hermitian matrix @xmath27 compensates for possible time - dependent flavour rotations .",
    "numerical solutions to this equation are presented in section  [ section : numerics ] , and it is shown that it indeed interpolates between the fully flavoured and the unflavoured regimes .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "appendix  [ appendix : finitewidth ] contains a discussion of the constraint and mass - shell equations including finite width effects , and the contribution of the right - handed neutrino to the thermal mass of the leptons is calculated in appendix  [ appendix : thmass ] .",
    "the usual strategy for deriving kinetic equations is to decompose the schwinger - dyson equations on the ctp into equations for the retarded and advanced propagators and the kadanoff - baym equations . in the weak coupling limit",
    ", one can solve the latter when approximating the particle densities as purely on - shell .",
    "this corresponds to taking the particle width to zero .    in this section ,",
    "we reiterate these arguments for the left - handed leptons . as an extension of earlier approaches  @xcite , where mass terms are introduced at tree - level ,",
    "we describe here the dynamics that arises from thermal one - loop corrections to the dispersion relations , which are mediated by flavour - blind gauge interactions as well as flavour - sensitive yukawa interactions .",
    "we employ here the notations and conventions for the ctp formalism and the gradient expansion that are explained in more detail within ref .",
    "the schwinger - dyson equation for the flavoured left - handed lepton propagator is @xmath28 which can be more compactly written as  @xcite @xmath29 where the symbol @xmath30 denotes a convolution and @xmath1 the delta function , @xmath31 are the ctp indices and @xmath32 flavour indices .",
    "the ctp structure can be decomposed into equations for the retarded and advanced propagators and a kadanoff - baym equation ,    [ ctp : equations ] @xmath33    here and in what follows , we make use of the definitions @xmath34 and the combinations @xmath35 where @xmath36 may stand for any two - point function on the ctp , in particular the propagators and self - energies .",
    "the wigner transformation is defined as a fourier transformation of a two - point function with respect to the relative coordinate , while keeping the average coordinate fixed : @xmath37 it provides a separation between the typical energy scale ( which is the temperature @xmath38 in the present case ) and the small macroscopic inverse time - scale , that governs the evolution of state parameters ( particle number and charge distributions in the present case ) .",
    "the ratio of these two time scales is then used to define the gradient expansion . in wigner space ,",
    "( [ ctp : equations ] ) take the form    [ ctp : eq : wigner ] @xmath39    where @xmath40\\ , \\partial_{(k)\\mu}b(k , x ) - [ \\partial_{(k)\\mu}a(k , x)]\\,\\partial_{(x)}^\\mu b(k , x ) \\right ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eqs .",
    "( [ ctp : eq : wigner ] ) correspond to an infinite tower of integro - differential equations .",
    "approximate solutions can be obtained within the scheme of gradient expansion  @xcite . in the context of leptogenesis",
    ", gradients occur due to the deviation of particle number distributions from equilibrium , which is induced by the hubble expansion of the universe . at the same time , for a sizeable lepton asymmetry to occur , it is crucial , that during leptogenesis , the rate @xmath41 is not very different from expansion rate @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , within this paper we are particularly interested in the parametric region where the @xmath43-lepton yukawa coupling @xmath44 relates to @xmath42 as @xmath45 , since otherwise we are either in the fully flavoured or in the unflavoured regime , which can be described by conventional approaches . in the present context ,",
