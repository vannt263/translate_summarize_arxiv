    "various ergodic and statistical properties of the periodic lorentz gas were studied during the last decades ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for a non - exhaustive list of references ) . in the case of",

    "equivalently , one can consider the free motion of a point - like particle in the billiard table @xmath17 obtained by removing pockets of the form of quarters of a circle of radius @xmath18 .",
    "if we identify @xmath19 with @xmath5 , then @xmath17 can be regarded as a punctured two - torus .",
    "the reflection in the side cushions of the table is specular and the trajectory between two such reflections is rectilinear .",
    "assume that the particle has constant speed , say equal to @xmath20 , and leaves the table when it reaches one of the four pockets .",
    "in this setting @xmath21 denotes the exit time from the table ( or equivalently the length of the trajectory ) .        in this paper",
    "we will study the case where the trajectory starts at the origin @xmath22 with initial velocity @xmath2 . in this case",
    "the first exit time is @xmath23 and one averages over @xmath2 only .",
    "we shall give very precise estimates on the average of @xmath24 and of the number @xmath4 of collisions of the particle with the side cushions as @xmath9 .",
    "the related problem of estimating the moments @xmath25 was raised by ya.g .",
    "sinai in 1981 .",
    "an answer was given in @xcite , where it was proved for any interval @xmath26 $ ] and any ( small ) @xmath27 that @xmath28 where @xmath29    since all the probability measures @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 have the support included into a common compact ( see lemma 3.1 in @xcite or lemma 2.1 in this paper ) , the equality implies that @xmath32 weakly as @xmath9 , and that the moments of @xmath33 are given by @xmath34 however , this does not directly provide an explicit formula for the density of @xmath33 .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to give a direct proof for this convergence , computing in the meantime the density of @xmath33 in closed form . for obvious symmetry reasons we may only consider the interval @xmath35 $ ] instead of @xmath36 $ ] . to state the main result we consider the repartition function @xmath37 \\ , ; \\ , { \\varepsilon}\\tilde{\\tau}_{\\varepsilon}(\\omega ) >",

    "firstly , since @xmath33 is a probability measure on @xmath51 $ ] , one must have that @xmath52 .",
    "but this amounts to @xmath53 that is to formula , and we got a first proof of that formula .",
    "however , one can prove in other ways .",
    "for instance , writing @xmath54 , integrating each term from @xmath55 to @xmath20 and using the taylor expansion for @xmath56 , we gather @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the dilogarithm function . plugging now @xmath59 in and using the formula ( cf .",
    "relation ( 1.6 ) in @xcite ) @xmath60 we arrive again at relation .",
    "thus , the fact that @xmath33 has mass one is equivalent to the ( non - trivial ) equality concerning the dilogarithm .",
    "secondly , theorem [ t1.1 ] should be compared with the most recent results of the first two authors ( @xcite ) , who proved the existence of the limit repartition @xmath61 \\ , ; \\ , { \\varepsilon}\\tau_{\\varepsilon}(x,\\omega)>t\\right\\ } \\right| \\qquad \\mbox{\\rm as $ \\ { \\varepsilon}\\rightarrow 0^+$.}\\ ] ]",
    "this repartition function is no longer compactly supported ; it was proved in @xcite to be of the form @xmath62 interestingly , the density @xmath63 coincides by @xmath64 since the factor @xmath18 is replaced by @xmath65 in @xcite ] for @xmath66 $ ] with the density of the limit measure of the geometric free path , proved to exist in the small - scatterer limit in @xcite , and computed independently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature of the free path lengths in the small - scatterer limit is that their limit repartition functions are closely related with dilogarithms in the homogeneous case treated in this paper , and with dilogarithms and possibly trilogarithms in the nonhomogeneous case treated in @xcite , where one averages over a phase space defined by both velocity and position , and where the limit measure has a tail at @xmath67 .",

    "moreover , one has @xmath70 for any _ ( _ small _ ) _ @xmath46 , where @xmath71    in particular this implies that the probability measures @xmath72 defined by @xmath73 converge weakly to the probability measure @xmath74 with repartition function @xmath75 .",
