    "we show the first scattered - light images of a debris disk surrounding hd 15745 , an f2v star at 64 pc .",
    "@xcite first reported hd 15745 as a debris disk candidate star based on excess thermal emission @xmath8 using @xmath9 data , and @xmath10 using @xmath11 data .",
    "@xcite modeled the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with a single temperature dust belt at 27 au radius with @xmath12 .",
    "we observed hd 15745 on 2006 july 17 with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) high resolution channel ( hrc ) coronagraph .",
    "the star was acquired behind the 1.8@xmath0 diameter occulting spot and three 700 second integrations with the f606w ( @xmath13= 591 nm , @xmath14 = 234 nm ) broadband filter were obtained at a fixed position angle .",
    "the three frames were median combined for cosmic ray rejection . the point spread function ( psf )",
    "was then subtracted using images from the hst archive of five f stars obtained with the acs coronagraph at the same wavelength and comparable integration times .",
    "all five versions of a psf - subtracted image of hd 15745 show the fan - shaped circumstellar nebulosity .",
    "the five versions were then median combined to produce a final image that was then corrected for geometric distortion .",
    "we also detected hd 15745 from gemini north with the michelle camera on 2006 september 20 using the n@xmath15 filter .",
    "we measure a flux of n@xmath15= 74.7@xmath162.9 mjy within a 1.4@xmath0 radius aperture , with an aperture correction based on near - contemporaneous images of the photometric standard star ( hd 20893 ) .",
    "the psf - subtracted hst data reveal a fan - shaped nebulosity surrounding hd 15745 in the approximate region between p.a.=190@xmath3 and p.a.=10@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we interpret the nebulosity as an azimuthally symmetric circumstellar disk inclined to our line of sight and composed of dust that has an asymmetric scattering phase function that produces a fan - like appearance @xcite .",
    "another possibility @xmath1 asymmetric grain erosion and blowback by encounters with the interstellar medium @xcite@xmath1 is less likely given that the southeastward proper motion ( @xmath17=46 mas / yr , @xmath18=-47 mas / yr ) and location of the star well within the local interstellar bubble @xcite , although at least one exception has been found for the latter point @xcite .    in principle",
    "the detection limit for the inner radius of the nebulosity is set by the occulting spot radius ( 0.9@xmath0 ) , but the presence of quasi - static speckles produce significant psf subtraction artifacts , limiting the inner detection radius to @xmath22@xmath0 ( 128 au ) radius .",
    "the outer radius of the disk is a sensitivity - limited value . in data that have been binned 8@xmath198 pixels ( 0.2@xmath20 ) ,",
    "the disk is detected as far as @xmath27.5@xmath0 ( 480 au ) radius .",
    "the 23.0 mag arcsec@xmath21 surface brightness isophote ( fig .",
    "2 ) shows a relatively symmetric fan - like morphology .",
    "the radial surface brightness profiles ( fig .",
    "3 ) are monotonic and can be approximated by power laws with an index of @xmath22 .",
    "we model the sed and scattered light appearance of the hd 15745 disk using a monte carlo radiation transfer code ( mcfost ; pinte et al .",
    "2006 ) in which a star radiates isotropically in space and illuminates an azimuthally - symmetric parameterized disk . in a first step , we determine the stellar parameters by fitting the sed up to 11@xmath6 m ( fig .",
    "4 ) . using nextgen models @xcite for the stellar photosphere , we find that the best fit model has @xmath23k and @xmath24 .",
    "we then proceed to fit the entire sed of hd 15745 to determine the disk properties . in order to consider as few free parameters as possible , we adopt a @xmath25 number density distribution , with @xmath26 and a constant @xmath27au , that extends from @xmath28 to @xmath29au and sums up to a total disk mass @xmath30 .",
    "the choice of @xmath27au is consistent with disk heights inferred from the edge - on debris disks @xmath31 pic and au mic @xcite , and does not significantly influence our results for values @xmath32au ( which is required to keep the disk optically thin to starlight ) .",
    "the @xmath33 number density profile fits the observed slope of the surface brightness ( see below ) .",
    "we also fix the dust grain properties to be a collection of compact spherical silicate grains from @xcite , with size distribution @xmath34 from @xmath35 to @xmath36 . because the disk is assumed to be gas - free , each grain size has its own temperature : smaller grains are hotter than larger at a given distance from the star .",
    "therefore , for each value of @xmath35 , we need to adjust @xmath28 to obtain a maximum dust temperature in the range 6080k , i.e. , a peak dust emission around 4050@xmath6 m ( fig .",
    "4 ) . once this is set , we can adjust the total dust mass to fit the sed . for values of @xmath35 ranging from 0.125 to 8@xmath6 m ( with a factor of 2 increment )",
    ", we perform this 2-parameter adjustment using a grid of 9 regularly - sampled values of @xmath28 and @xmath30 and compute the associated @xmath37 value .",
    "the narrowness of the disk thermal emission peak requires @xmath38 m ( hence @xmath39 m ) .",
    "larger grains deviate from the rayleigh regime in the mid - infrared and result in a much broader emission peak than is observed . by allowing a smaller value of @xmath35 and larger values of @xmath40 , we do not find a lower limit to @xmath35 from the analysis of the sed alone , down to at least 0.1@xmath6 m .",
    "provided @xmath28 and @xmath30 are adjusted accordingly , we always find satisfying fits to the sed .",
    "we then explore the disk surface brightness in order to better constrain @xmath35 . indeed , assuming @xmath40=10 , the scattering properties of the dust populations considered here vary strongly with @xmath35 .",
    "the albedo at 0.606@xmath6 m decreases from 0.82 to 0.65 as @xmath35 increases from 0.125@xmath6 m to 1@xmath6 m , because of the depletion of the highly reflective small grains . at the same time",
    ", the scattering asymmetry parameter , @xmath41 , increases from 0.65 to 0.89 because large grains scatter preferentially forward . as a consequence",
    ", the models with small values of @xmath35 can be rejected based on our acs m are @xmath24 mag arcsec@xmath21 too bright compared to our observations .",
    "furthermore , with such a dust population , the predicted flux ratio between the front and back side is low enough , independently of the inclination , that it should have been detected in our data set . to fit both the surface brightness of the disk and the apparent front / back asymmetry",
    ", our model indicates that @xmath42 m , implying a narrow grain size distribution and justifying @xmath43 @xmath44 our assumption of @xmath40 = 10    figure[fig4 ] illustrates our best fitting model , which has @xmath45 m , @xmath46 m , @xmath47au , @xmath48 and @xmath49=2.2@xmath1910@xmath50 . assuming a disk inclination @xmath51",
    ", a power law fit to the modeled surface brightness profiles results in a @xmath2 - 3.5 index and the observed front / back intensity ratio at 23 along the disk semi - minor axis is @xmath52 .",
    "both figures are consistent with the observations .",
    "subsequent models were calculated with @xmath53 and 1.25@xmath6 m to better constrain this parameter .",
    "we obtained marginally acceptable surface brightness fits in both cases and we conclude that @xmath54 in the disk surrounding hd 15745 .",
    "this result is consistent with a grain blowout size of @xmath21 @xmath6 m calculated for silicate grains .",
    "associated uncertainties on the disk inner radius and total disk mass are on the order of 10% .",
    "our quantitative estimates of @xmath35 and @xmath55 depend on the assumptions we made , but the overall conclusion ( order of magnitudes for grain sizes , hence inner radius and total dust mass , and the need for a narrow size distribution ) are robust .",
    "hd 15745 is now the fifth main sequence f star with a debris disk resolved in scattered light .",
    "three of these have ring - like structure , whereas hd 15745 shares a wide - disk architecture with hd 15115 ( f2v ; * ? ? ?",
    "the three ring - like architectures are found around hd 139664 ( f5v ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hd 181327 ( f5/f6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hd 10647 ( f9v ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the present time , the dust properties have been modeled only for hd 181327 , with a henyey - greenstein scattering asymmetry parameter @xmath56 @xcite . for debris disks around stars of other spectral types , au mic ( m1v )",
    "has a scattering asymmetry parameter similar to that of hd 15745 @xcite , whereas most other debris disk , such as fomalhaut ( a3v ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hd 107146 ( g5v ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have a low scattering asymmetry , comparable to that of hd 181327 .",
    "our present model suggests a concentration of dust grains in the range 1@xmath110 @xmath6 m , which is consistent with a wavy grain size distribution ( departure from a simple power law ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "small grains do not exist in sufficient quantity to counteract the highly asymmetric scattering phase function of the larger grains , whereas in other debris disk systems the collisional cascade may be robust to the smallest sizes , producing relatively symmetric scattering .",
    "further refinements for the properties of dust around hd 15745 and other debris disks requires resolved imaging observations at other wavelengths and with polarization .",
    "ultimately the explanation for why one debris disk has a particular grain size distribution may depend on differences in disk dynamical properties and the composition of grains ( e.g. , volatile vs. refractory elements ) .    among the f stars discussed above , hd 15115 and hd 181327 may belong to the beta pic moving group , with age @xmath212 myr @xcite .",
    "hd 15745 , on the other hand , may be a member of the castor moving group based on its galactic space motion .",

    "= ( @xmath58 ) km s@xmath59 for hd 15745 , consistent with ( @xmath57 ) = ( @xmath60 ) km s@xmath59 given for the castor moving group ( cmg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among the cmg members ,",
    "hd 38678 ( @xmath61 lep ) , another well - known debris disk star has a galactic space velocity ( @xmath57 ) = ( @xmath62 ) km s@xmath59 that is closest to that of hd 15745 .",
    "@xcite estimate that the cmg has an age of 200@xmath16100 myr , although @xcite estimate a younger age for hd 15745 ( `` 30 ? '' myr ) based on its location on an a - star h@xmath1r diagram and the relatively large dust optical depth .",
    "@xcite similarly conclude that nearly all stars with @xmath6310@xmath64 are younger than 10@xmath65 yr . the infrared excess for hd 15745 is an order of magnitude greater than that of cmg members fomalhaut , vega , and @xmath61 lep . from the five cmg candidates that are f - stars , two have have been detected at far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "hd 119124 ( f7.7v ) has @xmath666@xmath67 , comparable to that of fomalhaut and vega @xcite .",
    "hd 130819 ( f3v ) has @xmath68 @xcite , which is still a factor of seven less than that of hd 15745 .",
    "recent work demonstrates a large spread in dust optical depths at a given age @xcite which may be a consequence of the spread of initial disk masses @xcite .",
    "therefore the high optical depth of hd 15745 can not uniquely discriminate between a @xmath210 myr or a @xmath2100 myr age . assuming steady - state evolution ,",
    "the dust optical depth of hd 15745 could arise from a 10 myr - old debris disk that started with @xmath210 m@xmath5 of solid material , or a 100 myr - old disk that started with @xmath2100 m@xmath5 of solid material .",
    "the ambiguity is augmented by allowing stochastic spikes in dust production that may occur in a few per cent of debris disks .",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a more precise age for hd 15745 therefore requires further input using stellar properties .",
    "however , we note that the large geometric vertical optical depth of our model ( @xmath69 at 60 au radius ) implies a fiducial collisional destruction timescale @xmath70yr at 60au .",
    "this is significantly shorter than the age estimates for hd 15745 , implying that the circumstellar dust is collisionally evolved .",
    "moreover , the rapid collision timescale indicates that the radius of the inner disk hole approximates the location of the planetesimal belt that regenerates the observed dust , instead of signifying the radius where grains inspiraling from poynting robertson drag are trapped in resonances with planetary bodies @xcite .",
    "using the @xmath71 acs coronagraph , we present the first images of dust - scattered light from a debris disk surrounding the f2v star hd 15745 . the fan - shaped morphology is consistent with an azimuthally symmetric disk with asymmetric isophotes due to an asymmetric dust scattering phase function combined with a 67@xmath3 inclination to the line of sight .",
    "hd 15745 belongs in a category of wide disks with a sensitivity - limited outer extent near 500 au .",
    "our silicate grain models for the sed and the disk surface brightness suggest an inner disk radius of 60 au , a somewhat narrow grain size distribution between 1 and 10 @xmath6 m , and a total disk mass of 10@xmath72 .",
    "future observations should determine the optical and near - infrared colors , as well as polarization , to further constrain grain properties .",
    "high - resolution imaging of the inner part of the disk should reveal the inner hole that in the model presented here has radius 60 au , or 0.5@xmath0 ) radius from the star projected on the sky . due to the asymmetric scattering phase function",
    ", the inner boundary of the disk hole should appear as a 1@xmath73 elliptical feature .",
    "our silicate - grain disk model predicts a peak @xmath74-band and @xmath75-band surface brightnesses of 14.8 and 12.7 mag arcsec@xmath21 , respectively , or about 1 magnitude redder than the star itself .",
    "near - infrared data would thereby test our present disk model that is dominated by relatively large grains ( @xmath761 @xmath6 m ) , where the albedo is not significantly diminished in the near - infrared , yet the near - infrared scattering is more isotropic ( @xmath77=0.57 in @xmath75 vs. 0.89 in @xmath74 ) as the observing wavelength approaches the grain size .",
