    "the graphite , multi - layer , and single - layer graphene materials have been studied intensively , since the electric field effect has been found in atomically thin graphene films.@xcite these materials can be regarded as bulk systems . on the other hand , nanographenes with controlled edge structures have been predicted to have localized states along the zigzag edges.@xcite the presence of the edge states has been observed by experiments of scanning tunneling spectroscopy.@xcite thus , the studies of the edge states are one of the interesting topic of the field .",
    "the recent atomic bottom - up fabrication of nanoribbons really promotes experimental and theoretical investigations.@xcite    previously , one of the present authors has studied the stacking effects of the nanographene by considering weak inter - layer hopping interactions in the tight binding model.@xcite the cluster calculations have been performed , and compared with experiments of the magnetic properties .",
    "it has been found that open shell nature of the electronic orbital of the each layer is important .",
    "the existence of the spin in the each layer gives rise to the magnetism of the stacked nanographene .",
    "therefore , the simple tight binding model is effective .    in this paper ,",
    "bilayer graphene nanoribbon with zigzag edge is investigated with the tight binding model .",
    "two stacking structures , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are considered .",
    "the band splitting is seen in the @xmath0 structure , while the splitting in the wave number direction is found in the @xmath1 structure .",
    "the local density of states in the @xmath1 structure tend to avoid sites where inter - layer hopping interactions are present .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , the model is explained .",
    "the results are shown in section 3 .",
    "the paper is closed with summary in section 4",

    "the region surrounded by the dashed line is the unit cell in the direction of the one dimensional direction . at the circles , two carbon atoms of the upper and lower layers",
    "overlap completely , and there is the weak hopping interaction @xmath2 here . in ( b ) , the @xmath1 structure is shown , where the lower layer is shift right - down direction so the stacking pattern is different from that of the @xmath0 structure .",
    "the convention of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 structures are the same used in the paper.@xcite ( c ) the detailed view around the edge atom in the @xmath1 structure is displayed . ]",
    "we consider the following tight binding model @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the annihilation operators of electrons at the lattice site @xmath6 of the spin @xmath7 on the upper and lower layers , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 is the hopping integral of @xmath9 electrons between neighboring lattice sites .",
    "two stacking patterns , shown in figs . 1 ( a ) and ( b ) , are considered .",
    "they are named as @xmath0 and @xmath1 structures , respectively .",
    "this convention has been used in the literature.@xcite there are @xmath10 zigzag lines in upper and lower layers .",

    "the interlayer interaction strength is @xmath12 . in ( b ) , the split of the energy bands is seen compared with fig .",

    "( c ) . in order to see split structures clearly ,",
    "details near the brillouin zone edge are magnified for the single layer ( d ) , @xmath0 structure ( e ) , and @xmath1 structure ( f ) . in ( e ) and ( f ) , the energy bands of the single layer are shown by the red lines for comparison . the nearly flat band due to the edge state in @xmath13 is present at the energy @xmath14 in ( d ) , where @xmath15 is the unit cell length of the one dimensional direction of figs . 1 ( a ) and ( b )",
