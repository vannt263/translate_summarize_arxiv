    "the model accurately reproduces both the observed velocity profiles and imagery .",
    "the model shows that the main nebula does in fact extend in a north - south , and not east - west , direction , and that ` butterfly ' appearance of the central nebular regions is due to a projection effect .",
    "hatr  4 possesses an elongated , axisymmetric morphology with an equatorial enhancement consistent with a nebular ring .",
    "the ` butterfly ' appearance of the central region is shown to result from a line - of - sight inclination effect associated with the enhanced nebular waist , rather than a bipolar structure .",
    "the modelling has revealed an age of order 8200 years at a distance of 3 kpc , and an equatorial expansion velocity of 26@xmath14 kms@xmath2 - both fairly typical for pne .",
