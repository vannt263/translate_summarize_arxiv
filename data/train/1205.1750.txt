    "ptas layered structures with various local coordinations found considerable interest in the search for novel iron pnictide related superconductors.@xcite special interest is caused by the fe free srptas and srpt@xmath0as@xmath0 systems yielding @xmath1-values of of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . in the latter superconductivity",
    "occurs near a cdw - state pointing to a non - neglible electron ",
    "phonon interaction .",
    "@xcite is noteworthy since there in spite of the sizable pt doping and metallic ptas - block layers in between the usual feas - layers , a large @xmath10 38  k has been achieved .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to considering the simplest system among that novel class : namely srptas with a honeycomb structure reminiscent of the structure found in mgb@xmath0 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "there is a clear element of two dimensionality to the structure , with layers of sr atoms separated by pt and as atoms arranged in closed - spaced pairs .",
    "as compared with an earlier calar relativistic ( sr ) calculation @xcite , we consider here the more precise full relativistic full - potential ( frfp ) calculation based on density functional theory ( dft ) . in order to quantify empirically `` later on '' the role of many - body effects , we also present fermi surface ( fs ) calculations .",
    "our calculations were carried out employing the fully relativistic version @xcite of the full - potential ( frfp ) local orbital ( fplo ) minimum - basis band - structure method . in this scheme the 4-component kohn ",
    "sham  dirac equation , which contains the spin - orbit coupling up to all orders , is solved self - consistently .",
    "thereby we adopted the following basis set for the valence states : the @xmath11 states for sr , while for pt and as we used @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the high - lying @xmath14 and @xmath15 semicore states of sr and pt , which might hybridize with the valence states , are in this way included in our basis .",
    "the site - centered potentials and densities were expanded in spherical harmonic contributions up to @xmath16 .",
    "the number of @xmath17-points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone was 196 , but calculations were performed also with 405 and up to 2176 @xmath17-points to resolve the fine structure of the density of states at the fermi energy ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we used the perdew - wang @xcite parameterization of the exchange - correlation potential in the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) .",
    "srptas crystallizes in a hexagonal structure derived from the binary alb@xmath0-type as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in srptas ,",
    "the al sites are occupied by sr ions and the b sites by either pt or as atoms so that they alternate in the honeycomb layer as well as along the @xmath19-axis .",
    "we have performed _ ab initio _ optimizations of the equilibrium volume and the lattice parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath19 , using the lda - relativistic approach .",
    "we have computed total energy versus unit - cell volume .",
    "the lda minimum volume slightly underestimates the experimental value by  2.4 % .",
    "similarly , the calculated / optimized lattice constants @xmath20 and @xmath19 are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values , i.e.  @xmath21    ( -0.75% ) and @xmath22   ( -2.63% ) .",
    "the small negative deviations of few percents are typical for present day dft - lda calculations ( see below ) .",
    "noteworthy is that our optimized lattice constants are closer to the experimental data than those reported in ref .",
    "2 using sr : @xmath23   ( + 1.26% ) and @xmath24 (+1.1% ) which , in contrast , opposite slightly overiiestimate them .",
    "we have performed nonmagnetic band - structure calculations for the experimental lattice parameters , which are : a=4.244  and c=8.989  and with internal parameters as sr ( 0 0 0 ) , pt ( 1/3 2/3 1/4 ) , and as ( 2/3 1/3 1/4 ) @xcite .",
    "the band structure of srptas computed within the sr frfp schemes are presented in fig .",
    "we find for the srptas system using either the sr or frfp scheme four bands which cross the fermi surface .",
    "these bands are denoted as bands 97 , 99 , 101 , and 103 , according to their number in the valence band complex of the frfp calculation counted from below . following the line @xmath25-m in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the crossing points of all bands with the fermi level are clearly visible .",
    "the influence of the relativistic effects is most pronounced along the m ",
    "k@xmath25 line , where the upper two bands 101 and 103 remain degenerate in the sr calculation along the l - h - a line so that we expect sizable differences in the extremal fermi surface cross sections to be discussed in the next section . also the total dos shows a measurable difference between the frpl calclations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and the sr ones : @xmath26 ( states / ev@xmath27 f.u . ) vs.  2.07 states / ev@xmath27 f.u .",
    "reported in ref .",
    "2 . in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] we have highlighted the orbital character of the relativistic band scheme through the colors and their weight , through the thickness of the bands .",
    "the flat bands crossings @xmath18 along the in - plane @xmath25m  k and a  h ",
    "l directions are admixtures and dominated almost equally by pt 5@xmath28 and as 4@xmath15 states . whereas the frfp calculations for the pt @xmath29 dos yield 0.77 states / ev@xmath27 f.u .",
    "which is relatively close to 0.7 states / ev@xmath27 f.u .",
    "reported in ref .  2 , however , the as @xmath30 contributions differ by a factor of 3 : 0.99 states / ev@xmath27 f.u . vs.  0.3 in ref .  2",
    "physically , this means that in our calculations the covalent pt - as bonding is more pronounced and in general the pt-5@xmath28 as-4@xmath15 complex is more dominant in our case : 72% vs.  48% .",
    "in addition , the bands with an admixture of as 4@xmath15 and pt 5@xmath28 states split along the @xmath25m and the a  l directions .",
    "a detailed insight into the electronic structure can be gained from de haas  van alphen ( dhva ) measurements which have not been reported on srptas to date . to initiate possible experiments",
    ", we may provide interested readers with these dhva frequencies and their angular dependencies .",
    "the extremal orbits have been calculated using the numerical scheme presented in @xcite , which is outlined in detail in earlier work on this subject @xcite .",
    "the highly anisotropic fermi surface of srptas calculated within the relativistic scheme ( as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] consists of six sheets existing in four twofold kramers degenerated bands ( 97 , 99 , 101 , 103 ) and eleven extremal orbits for a magnetic field in c - direction .",
    "the fs sheets consist of four small tubes directed along @xmath25-a direction , deformed tube - like along the h  k direction , and a small pocket around k.",
    "the electrons on the tubes of the third and fourth bands ( sheets 56 and 1011 ) have the largest fermi velocity while electrons on the first and second bands have a slow velocity but the minimal velocity appears within the sheets around k and h.        the fs averaged fermi velocity within the honeycomb - plane amounts to @xmath31cm / s in frfp and @xmath32cm / s in sr calculations and the unscreened in - plane plasma frequency @xmath33 ev in sr and @xmath34ev in frfp calculations . for the @xmath19-axis we found @xmath35 ev , only , which gives a direct measure for the strong electronic anisotropy . within an effective one band ginzburg  landau model a huge mass anisotropy of about 22.5 could be estimated .",
    "taking into account an expected mass renormalization due to the high - energy electron ",
    "electron interaction by a factor of about 3 as for typical transition metals , one expects @xmath36 ev .",
    "then the anisotropy could be reduced to about 7.5 .",
    "the renormalized in - plane plasma frequency determines the slope of the high - temperature resistivity @xmath37 and the penetration depth or the condensate density .",
    "the calculated fermi velocities are relatively large .",
    "they slightly exceed those for the sister compound srpt@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite.using these fermi velocities , the experimental data of ref .  1 for the slope of the upper critical field near @xmath1 of about 0.096 t / k one estimates within the one - band whh - theory @xmath38 t , which is at variance with the linear estimation adopted in ref.@xcite yielding 0.22 t. from eliashberg - theory for a single effective band @xcite one obtaines 0.14  t in the clean limit adopting a weak coupling regime for the superconductivity , say , @xmath39 in accord with the low @xmath1-value .",
    "if , however , @xmath40 t will be confirmed by future measurements below 1.8  k , a more sophisticated multiband model should be employed . in this case , @xmath41 should be either dominated by a small group of slow electrons , e.g.  the pockets around h whereas the slope near @xmath1 is dominated by fast electrons from the large red cylinders ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "here , we have investigated electronic and bonding properties of the superconducting compound srptas .",
    "relativistic effects have been found to change the electronic structure considerably . in particular",
    ", the splitting of bands leads to more fermi surface sheets and extremal orbits to be observed in future de haas - van alphen measurements .",
    "our theoretical investigation has shown a band - structure and fermi surface properties reminiscent of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "however , the covalent bonding between the pt 5@xmath28 and as 4@xmath15 states is much weaker than that between the b states in mgb@xmath0 therefore , the superconductivity occurs at low @xmath42 , only .",
    "also a preliminary analysis of the upper critical field data points to a weak coupling assignment of srptas . in a recent computational investigation by means of lapw implemented in the wien2k code with gga @xcite approximation",
    ", the authors claimed that the relativistic effects result mainly in an energy shift and splitting in core and semi - core pt states which are situated deep under the fermi level @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we found a more than three times larger partial density of as derived @xmath30-states at the fermi level within our frfp scheme and obtained also more bands and fs sheets due to band splitting .",
    "finally , we encourage low temperature measurements such as specific heat and magnetic quantum oscillations on srptas to further elucidate its electronic properties",
    ". investigations for srptas on single crystals at ambient and under pressure and as function of doping might provide additional interesting information about the possible role of many - body effects and a deeper insight into the superconducting pairing mechanism .",
    "we foresee that chemical and structural modifications in srptas and related systems may yield optimization of its superconducting properties .",

    "_ note added in proof . _ + the results of the present paper have been presented at the conference \" e - mrs 2011 fall meeting , warsaw ( poland ) in september 19 - 23 , 2011 .",
    "after submission of the manuscript to the conference proceedings we learned about a similar preprint by s.j .",
    "et al . _ , arxiv:1202.1604v1 using the different flapw - method . in particular , the calculated band structure , the plasma frequencies and fermi velocities are close each to the other : 5.57 ev and 3.76 @xmath43 m / s to be compared with 5.24 ev and 3.54@xmath43 m / s in our calculations .",
    "we also obtained a sizable enhancement of the mass anisotropy by the spin - orbit coupling of 30.8 to be compared to 22.5 in our case .",
    "thus strong anisotropies of the upper critical field of about 5.55 and 4.74 , respectively , are predicted .",
