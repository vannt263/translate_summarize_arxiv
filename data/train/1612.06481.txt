    "submillimeter ( submm ) and millimeter ( mm ) follow - up observations have played an essential role in identifying gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglow and host galaxies in , for example delineating the energy scale , geometry , radiation physics , and environments of long grbs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , submm / mm follow - up observations have lagged behind x - ray , optical and cm radio observations ( summaries of afterglow observations are available in @xcite ) because of the limited sensitivity of previous submm / mm facilities coupled with the higher redshift of _ swift _ grbs .",
    "the atacama large millimeter / submm array ( alma ) was first used in the early science phase for grb host galaxies , and its observations have provided exceptional results @xcite .",
    "however , observations for afterglow phase are still limited because of the observation guidelines of alma ( e.g. a 3-week reaction time since too triggering ) for the early science phase ( e.g. cycle 1 ) . here , we report the first open - use based alma observation of the late afterglow phase of grb131030a .",
    "grb 131030a was detected using the _ swift _ @xcite burst alert telescope ( bat ) at 20:56:18 ut on 2013 october 30 @xcite .",
    "the duration , @xmath6 in the 15 - 350 kev band was @xmath7 s @xcite .",
    "the afterglow in x - ray and optical bands was also identified using the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ) . on the basis of the uvot observation ,",
    "the burst position was determined at @xmath8 , @xmath9 with a 90% confidence error radius of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the redshift of grb 131030a was measured at @xmath11 on the basis of the optical spectroscopic observation by using the nordic optical telescope @xcite .",
    "the polarized early ( 655s to 2 hrs ) optical lightcurve of the afterglow was also observed using the robopol instrument @xcite .",
    "the konus - wind observation also revealed a prompt emission and characterized the spectrum properties in the 20 kev @xmath12 15 mev range .",
    "the time - averaged spectrum was fitted using the band function with the spectrum peak energy @xmath13 of 177@xmath1410 kev .",
    "the isotropic energy @xmath15 was also estimated as @xmath16 erg , assuming cosmological parameters of @xmath17 70 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we used alma to observe the afterglow at 345-ghz ( default continuum setup ) with the c32 - 5 configuration under the cycle 1 open - use mode .",
    "although the observation policy of the alma cycle 1 includes a 3-week reaction time restriction for its execution through too triggering , the 345-ghz observation was initiated at 23:11 ut on 2013 november 16 ( 17.12 d after the grb ) .",
    "thus , the observation was executed several days earlier than expected .",
    "three calibrators ( j2232 + 117 , j2148 + 0657 , and j2301@xmath120158 ) for flux , bandpass , and phase calibrations , respectively , were also observed .",
    "the on - source time and total observing time were 53 min and 90 min , respectively .",
    "the raw data were calibrated using the common astronomy software applications 4.1 ( casa , @xcite ) with the standard procedure , and final cleaned images were made using the `` clean '' task with a robust briggs weighting ( robust parameter of 0.5 ) .",
    "the resulting synthesized beam sizes were @xmath23 with a position angle of 68.2 deg .",
    "no source was observed from the location of the optical afterglow to the 3@xmath24 limit of 0.12 mjy ( figure [ host ] left ) . as shown in figure [ submmaf ] , this limit is significantly deep in the submm bands among other afterglow observations .",
    "although alma observed the bright submm afterglow associated with grb110715a ( @xmath25 mjy at 3.6 d ) during the commissioning phase @xcite , the quality of observation was comparable with those of other smaller submm instruments .",
    "hence , this demonstration of the high sensitivity follow - up would be a benchmark with further submm observations .",
    "as shown in figure [ host ] ( left ) , a source ( almaj2300 - 0522 ) with @xmath26 mjy was identified in the alma image at @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( approximately @xmath5 from the grb position ) .",
    "although several astrometry - related bugs ( e.g. phase calibrator coordinate inconsistency ) were reported from the alma arc after data delivery , we could not reasonably explain the significant offsets of approximately @xmath5 ( more than 10-fold the beam size ) from the grb position .",
    "in addition , the source also had an optical counterpart in the subaru _ rc_-band image ( figure [ host ] right , @xmath292.5 ) .",
    "we used the reionization and transients infrared camera ( ratir ) to monitor the afterglow in _ r- _ , _",
    "i- _ , _ z- _ , _ y- _ , _ j- _ and _ _ h-__bands from 1.763@xmath30 s to 7.220@xmath31 s after the burst .",
    "ratir is a six band simultaneous optical and nir imager mounted on the autonomous 1.5  m harold l. johnson telescope at the observatorio astronmico nacional on sierra san pedro mrtir in baja california , mexico @xcite .",
    "the images were reduced in near real - time using an automatic pipeline .",
    "bias subtraction and twilight flat division were performed using algorithms written in python , image alignment was conducted by astrometry.net @xcite and image co - addition was achieved using swarp @xcite .",
    "we performed photometry for individual science frames and mosaic using sextractor with apertures ranging from 2 to 30 pixels ( @xmath32 in optical , @xmath33 in nir ) .",
    "based on the weighted average of the flux in these apertures for all stars in a field , an annular point - spread - function ( pfs ) was constructed .",
    "we then optimized point source photometry by fitting this psf to the annular flux values of each source . the photometric calibration in _ r- _ , _ i- _ , _ z- _ , _ j _ and _ h _ bands were made comparing with the sloan digital sky survey data release 9 ( sdss ) and the two micron all sky survey .",
    "the ratir and sdss _",
    "r- _ , _ i- _ and _ _",
    "z-__bands agree to within @xmath343 per cent ( butler et al .",
    "2016 in prep . ) .",
    "_ y-__band calibration , we used an empirical relation in terms of _ j _ and _ h _ magnitudes derived from the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) wide field camera observations .",
    "we also conducted the _",
    "b- _ and _ _ r-__band follow - up observations by using the robotic 1-m telescope at the mt . lemmon observatory , which is operated by the korea astronomy space science institute @xcite .",
    "the observations were initiated at 01:43 ut on 2013 october 31 ( 1.720@xmath30 s after the burst ) , and three epochs for monitoring were conducted during the same run . a standard routine including bias subtraction and flat - fielding corrections",
    "was employed to process the data using the iraf package .",
    "the daophot package was used to perform aperture photometry of the grb images . for the photometric calibration of the afterglow , several stars from the nomad catalog were chosen . to remove the effects of the galactic interstellar extinction",
    ", we used the reddening map by @xcite .",
    "the multifrequency lightcurve is shown in figure [ lc ] ( left ) .",
    "the x - ray data were obtained from the online data repository prepared by @xcite . the temporal evolution in the _",
    "r- _ and _ _ i-__bands indicates an achromatic temporal break at approximately @xmath35 s. in contrast , x - ray light curve later than @xmath36 sec shows the simple evolution . to describe the light curves , we employed a single power - law function by dividing light curve data into earlier ( @xmath37 ) and later ( @xmath38 ) phases .",
    "we successfully fitted the single power - law function to the earlier light curves .",
    "the _ r- _ , _ i- _ , and x - ray band light curves in the later phase were also described using the single power law function . the x - ray light curve later than @xmath36 sec was also described with the single power - law function with the decay index of @xmath39 . here",
    ", we use a notation @xmath40 with sub - indices of observed band .",
    "the fitting results are summarized in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "we also successfully fitted the broken power - law model to the _",
    "r- _ and _ _ i-__bands light curves . for the _ _ r-__band , we obtained @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 s ; for the _ _ i-__band , we obtained @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 s. here , sub - indices of 1 and 2 , and @xmath47 indicate before and after the temporal break , and the break time , respectively .",
    "the decay index of x - ray afterglow before the jet break is also estimated as @xmath48 .",
    "we generated spectral flux distributions at @xmath49 s ( 0.268 d ; first epoch ) and 3.76@xmath31 s ( 4.34 d ; second epoch ) .",
    "for the first epoch , we also added _",
    "uvw2- _ , _ u- _ , _ b- _ , and _ _ v-__band data that were obtained using _ swift_/uvot at approximately 2.3@xmath30 s after the burst , which coincided with the ratir observations .",
    "we used the standard procedure for the uvot analysis .",
    "as shown in figure [ lc ] ( right ) , the sharp spectral drop at approximately 1@xmath50 hz that was caused by the ly@xmath51 absorption at @xmath11 was identified .",
    "thus , we fitted the first epoch sed with a power - law function by excluding the _ uvw2 _ data and obtained @xmath52 ( @xmath53 with @xmath54 ) for the first epoch and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 with @xmath57 ) for the second epoch .",
    "as shown in figure [ lc ] ( right ) , the optical sed , including the uv data points obtained using uvot , were effectively described by the single power - law function without considering the host galaxy extinction .",
    "we reduced the subaru suprime - cam images obtained from the smoka archive system @xcite .",
    "the grb131030a field was observed using the @xmath58-bands during the previous follow - up observations of xrf040916 on september 20 , 2004 .",
    "owing to the wide field of view of the suprime - cam @xcite , the location of grb 131030a had an effective exposure time of 2400 s. the basic reduction of the suprime - cam data was performed using the sdfred @xcite .",
    "the final coadded image was astrometrically aligned relative to the sdss catalog , resulting in an rms scatter of @xmath59 .",
    "figure [ host ] ( right ) provides the @xmath58-band images for the grb131030a field , and an extended source was identified inside the position error region through _ swift_/uvot . by using iraf centroid , the location of the source was determined at @xmath60 , @xmath61 , which is @xmath62 away from the afterglow location .",
    "the projected offset of 0.6 kpc is smaller than values for long grbs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we concluded that the source was the host galaxy of grb131030a .",
    "the brightness with a @xmath63 radius was @xmath64 .",
    "the optical counterpart of almaj2300 - 0522 was also measured as @xmath65 with a @xmath66 radius .",
    "the multicolor monitoring observations performed using ratir provided an effective dataset for describing the forward shock synchrotron radiation .",
    "the spectral index change between first and second epochs could be due to the cooling frequency passage in the optical band .",
    "the absence of the sharp cooling break in the optical light curves could be explained by the smooth transition of spectral regimes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the closure relation ( e.g. @xcite ) also indicated that the optical afterglow at @xmath49 s and 1.56@xmath31 s was consistent with @xmath67 under the interstellar medium ( ism ) with a slow cooling condition ( @xmath68 ) and jet phase with @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , respectively .",
    "although the optical afterglow showed the jet break , the x - ray afterglow revealed no temporal break at the jet break time .",
    "the @xmath71 relation of @xmath72 for before the jet break was also the explicit outlier ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , these results indicate that the x - ray afterglow could have an origin that was distinct from that of the optical afterglow ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ".    to describe the x - ray afterglow behavior , we performed forward shock synchrotron radiation modeling with the optical light curves and alma upper limit by using the boxfit code @xcite . because the code involved a two - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical jet simulation with a homogeneous circumburst medium , we hereafter , consider only the ism condition .",
    "we determined the optimal modeling parameters with the on - axis case ( observing angle , @xmath73 ) as @xmath74 , @xmath75 erg , @xmath76 @xmath77 , @xmath78=2.28 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "the values were updated from those in @xcite by using data from six oir bands and the alma 1-@xmath0 limit .",
    "figure [ lc ] shows the most effective model functions for multicolor light curves .",
    "the broadband sed modeling results are also provided in figure [ bsed ] .",
    "these results clearly show the excess in the x - ray band .    on the basis of the analytic solution described by @xcite , we calculated the expected flux density of synchrotron self - inverse - compton radiation ( ssc ) by using forward shock modeling .",
    "the reasonable flux scale and differences ( approximately 10-fold times ) between synchrotron and ssc for the earlier afterglow were estimated using the model .",
    "however , the ssc model could not explain the different temporal evolution in the late phase .",
    "in addition , the expected @xmath81 pass in the x - ray band ( @xmath82 sec ) with the analytic solution was not identified in the observed x - ray spectrum ( figure [ xrayspec ] ) .",
    "hence , ssc is unlikely to explain the observational properties .",
    "one of the alternative models for describing the distinct temporal evolution between optical and x - ray is the late prompt emission @xcite .",
    "a spinning - down magnetar as the central engine is one of the explanations for the x - ray excess @xcite .",
    "the alma observation also provides a unique upper limit of 345-ghz for estimating the rest - frame infrared luminosity and star formation rate ( sfr ) of the host galaxy .",
    "following @xcite , we applied a redshifting to a template infrared sed , which we obtained from the library provided by @xcite .",
    "the sed library is luminosity - dependent ( @xmath83 to @xmath84 ) based on a locally calibrated luminosity - dust temperature relation and does not enable scaling the seds .",
    "we constrained the 3-@xmath0 upper limits of ir luminosity as @xmath85 . using the sfr conversion of star - forming galaxies , sfr(@xmath3 yr@xmath86 @xcite used in @xcite",
    ", we obtained the 3-@xmath0 upper limit of sfr as @xmath2 ( @xmath3  yr@xmath4 ) .",
    "the upper limit of sfr was consistent with those of the tough samples that constrained the average sfr as lower than 15 @xmath3  yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "almaj2300 - 0522 is @xmath5 ( 30.2 kpc ) from the grb location .",
    "some of the grb host galaxies show companions and exceptionally extended emission .",
    "hst images resolved companions for grb021004 at @xmath87 ( 2.4 kpc ) from the host location @xcite , for grb050820a at @xmath88 ( 10.7 kpc ) @xcite and @xmath89 ( 3.3 kpc ) , and for grb080605 at @xmath63 ( 8.7 kpc ) @xcite , respectively .",
    "most notably , the ly@xmath51 imaging for the grb000926 host galaxy revealed extended emission of approximately 33.7 kpc at the long axis @xcite .",
    "thus , almaj2300 - 0522 is potentially a component of the grb131030a host galaxy . by assuming the same redshift with grb131030a",
    ", we also obtained @xmath90 and the corresponding sfr of 147 @xmath3  yr@xmath4 by using the same template redshifting method ( green solid line in figure [ hostsed ] ) .",
    "the obtained values were comparable or lower than those of observed ultra luminous infrared galaxy host cases ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another noteworthy feature is that almaj2300 - 0522 is categorized as a faint ( @xmath911 mjy ) submm galaxy ( smg ) .",
    "faint smgs tend not to have optical counterparts , in contrast to almaj2300 - 0522 , even when ultra - deep optical survey data are used @xcite .",
    "hence , future studies that use redshift estimation can clarify the smg - grb association .",
    "we conducted the first open - use based alma observation for the afterglow of grb131030a .",
    "the high sensitivity of the alma observation would make a significant improvement in further afterglow follow - ups such as coordinated submm observations for radio polarimetry and longterm multi - frequency monitoring . with the comprehensive optical and near infrared afterglow observations performed through ratir",
    ", we described the forward shock synchrotron radiation and x - ray excess in the afterglow .",
    "the excess is inconsistent with the ssc model and requires another component such as late prompt emission .",
    "our alma observation also constrains the 3-@xmath0 limit of infrared luminosity and sfr of the host galaxy , which is consistent with other nearby @xmath92 samples . the submm source , almaj2300 - 0522 is located @xmath5 from the grb location . although the separation is rather large , the source may be one component of the host galaxy , according to previous host galaxy cases ( e.g. grb000926 ) . to further analyze the association between almaj2300 - 0522 and grb131030a , secure redshift estimation is required .",
