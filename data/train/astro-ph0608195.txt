    "solar - type stars have x - ray emitting coronae with the temperatures , @xmath6 k , and hot stellar winds stream out with the asymptotic terminal velocities , @xmath7 km s@xmath8 , comparable to the escape velocities at the surfaces . the total mass lost by the wind is negligible during the main sequence ( ms ) phase in comparison with the stellar mass , whereas the wind may play a role in the loss of the angular momentums . along with the stellar evolution to red giant branch ( rgb ) , the mass loss rate , @xmath5 s , increases by 4 - 10 orders of magnitude @xcite , while @xmath9 drops to @xmath10 km s@xmath8 , which is smaller than the surface escape velocity .",
    "in addition , the temperature of the wind also decreases , which is probably drastic across the `` dividing line '' ( dl hereafter ; linsky & haisch 1979 ) discussed below .",
    "the mass loss during the rgb phase becomes more important , and it may control the later evolution of a star itself .",
    "for instance , some stars evolve to a peculiar group of blue horizontal branch stars , and it is inferred that it is related to the mass loss during the rgb phase @xcite . in spite of its importance , however , the acceleration mechanism of red giant winds is not well understood .",
    "it was reported that cool single rgb stars redward of the dl ( near spectral type k1 iii in hertzsprung - russel ( hr)-diagram ; figure [ fig : hr ] ) showed an evidence of neither ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation of c@xmath11 ( @xmath12 k ) @xcite nor soft x - ray ( @xmath13 k ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite further pointed out that the stellar winds appear cool and massive after stars cross the dl .",
    "however , @xcite observed late - type super - giants in the noncoronal zone that exhibit both uv emission and blue - shifted chromospheric absorption features , indicating that hot gas and cool outflow coexist .",
    "such hybrid stars were also detected by later observations ( e.g. ayres et al .",
    "1998 ) , whereas the activity levels of uv / soft x - ray are much lower than in the coronal zone .",
    "these observations show that the simple dl picture roughly holds while the reality seems a bit more complicated .",
    "rgb stars are generally slow rotators .",
    "the radiation luminosities of intermediate- and low - mass stars near the dl are not still large , either .",
    "therefore , the centrifugal force and radiation pressure are not sufficient in accelerating the stellar winds ( e.g. judge & stencel 1991 ) . instead , the surface convective layer is expected to be the main origin of driving the winds and uv / x - ray activities .",
    "magnetic fields are probably generated by turbulent dynamo in the convection zone .",
    "the energy of the surface turbulences is lifted up through the magnetic fields , and the dissipation of the energy in upper regions leads to the heating of the atmosphere and the acceleration of the wind .",
    "this picture is essentially the same as what takes place in the solar corona and wind .",
    "difference from the sun is that the surface gravity is much smaller in rgb stars . in a nave way of thinking ,",
    "the transition from the steady coronae to the cool winds ( with some hybrid activities ) is possibly explained by this gravity effect even though other conditions are similar ; the cool atmosphere comes to flow out before heated up to coronal temperature ( @xmath13 k ) , as the gravity confinement weakens .",
    "many pioneering works have tried to reveal nature of red giant winds ( e.g. hartmann & macgregor 1980 ; holzer , fl , & leer 1983 ; charbboneau & macgregor 1995 ) . however , the consecutive processes from the surface to the wind explained above have not been studied self - consistently ; previous model calculations started from locations far above the photosphere in order to avoid difficulties arising from the huge density contrast .",
    "moreover , they assume mechanical or phenomenological `` wave '' energies with somewhat ad hoc prescription of the dissipation . in this paper , we perform dynamical simulations of stellar winds from the photosphere to @xmath14 in open magnetic field regions , where @xmath15 is stellar radius .",
    "we give perturbations at the photosphere originating from the surface convection .",
    "these fluctuations excite waves that propagate upwardly . among various modes",
    "the wave travels to a sufficiently large distance to contribute to the acceleration and heating of the stellar wind .",
    "we simulate the propagation and dissipation of the waves by solving nonlinear mhd equations , and treat the heating and acceleration of the gas in a fully self - consistent manner without conventional heating functions (  [ sec : dwv ] ) .",
    "wind properties , such as @xmath5 and @xmath9 , are determined from the surface conditions without ad hoc parameters .",
    "another advantage of dynamical simulations is that we do not have to care about the critical ( sonic ) point(s ) , which is often problematic when constructing a transonic wind solution under the steady - state condition .",
    "a stable wind structure is automatically selected whether it is transonic or subsonic .",
    "we already carried out simulations in the solar corona and wind ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter si05 ; si06 ) .",
    "we showed that the coronal heating and solar wind acceleration in the open field regions are natural consequences of the photospheric perturbations ; the waves generated from the surface effectively dissipate in the corona by nonlinear mechanism to sufficiently heat and accelerate the solar wind in spite of the energy loss via radiative cooling , thermal conduction , and wave reflection .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the evolution of the stellar winds from ms to rgb stages by extending this work to cool rgb stars .",
    "we investigate the stellar winds of a 1@xmath16 star from ms ( _ i.e. _ present sun ) to rgb across the dl , where @xmath16 is the solar mass .",
    "for comparison we also study a more massive rgb star with @xmath17 both blueward and redward of the dl .    ",
    "[ sec : mod ] presents our simulation method . in  [ sec : esw ] we show the results of the simulations , focusing on the evolution and time - dependent nature of the stellar winds .",
    "we discuss comparisons with related works as well as the uncertainties and limitations of our simulations in  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we simulate the wave - driven stellar winds of the various stars summarized in table [ tab : sttp ] and in figure [ fig : hr ] . first , we consider the @xmath18 stars with different stellar radii , @xmath19 ( _ i.e. _ the present sun ) , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is solar radius , to study the evolution of the winds ; note that the dl is between the latter two cases .",
    "we also simulate the stars with @xmath17 near the dl to compare with the @xmath18 cases . here",
    "we adopt the stellar evolutionary tracks from @xcite to determine the basic stellar parameters , such as @xmath15 and effective temperatures , @xmath24 , which are used to estimate the densities , @xmath25 , at the photospheres and the photospheric amplitudes , @xmath26 , of the surface convection (  [ sec : phfl ] ) .",
    "we consider 1d flux tubes that are super - radially open .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : flxtb ] , a certain fraction of the stellar surface is covered by closed loops so that open flux tubes diverge more rapidly than the radial expansion @xcite .",
    "we inject velocity and magnetic field fluctuations originating from the surface convection at the photospheres , which are the inner boundaries of the simulations (  [ sec : phfl ] ) .",
    "these fluctuations excite various waves , a fraction of which propagate upwardly .",
    "we treat both energy and momentum transfers in stellar winds , namely the propagation and dissipation of the waves and the consequent acceleration and heating of the surrounding gas , in a self - consistent manner .",
    "we set the outer boundaries at @xmath14 at which the outgoing condition of both materials and mhd waves is properly prescribed ( si06 ) . in this paper",
    "we neglect centrifugal force , which is a reasonable assumption since low mass ms stars and rgb stars generally rotate slowly , and radiation pressure , which is also appropriate , where it might become important in more evolved asymptotic giant branch stars with dusts in the atmospheres .",
    "radial field strength , @xmath27 , is given by the conservation of magnetic flux as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a super - radial expansion factor .",
    "a 1d flux tube is fixed by the field strength at the photosphere , @xmath30 , and @xmath29 .",
    "we set @xmath30 and @xmath29 based on our previous solar studies ( si05 ; si06 ) .",
    "while the average field strength is @xmath31 g on the solar photosphere , magnetic field lines are swept into inter - granulation lanes so that the localized strength becomes @xmath32 g to a few kg .",
    "these field lines rapidly expand and becomes @xmath33 g in the coronal region . finally in the outer region ( @xmath34 a few @xmath15 ) the field lines distribute almost radially .",
    "we use the the same @xmath35 g and the same total expansion factor , @xmath36 , for all the models .",
    "note that these values give @xmath37 g , which is the total magnetic flux of the open field regions divided by the stellar surface .",
    "the average field strength becomes larger by adding the contributions from closed field regions (  [ sec : unc ] ) .",
    "we use the same functional form of the expansion as in si06 ( see also kopp & holzer 1976 ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "a flux tube initially expands by a factor of @xmath41 around @xmath42 , corresponding to the funnel structure @xcite by closed loops , and followed by @xmath43 times expansion around @xmath44 due to the large scale ( dipole ) magnetic fields .",
    "the total super - radial expansion is defined as @xmath45 .",
    "we adopt @xmath46 and @xmath47 in all the models . @xmath48 and @xmath49 of each model",
    "are summarized in table [ tab : sttp ] .",
    "@xmath50 is set to be ( roughly ) proportional to the scale height ( @xmath51 ; see equation [ eq : isdns ] for a more specific form ) because closed loops are supposed to be taller in lower gravity stars if the surface magnetic field conditions are the same ( but see  [ sec : unc ] ) .",
    "accordingly @xmath49 is also set to be larger in more evolved stars .",
    "we adopt the widths of the expansions , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . actually , the most important parameter that determines the stellar wind structure is @xmath54 and the other parameters , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath41 , and @xmath43 , only give small corrections .",
    "we dynamically solve ideal mhd equations with radiative cooling and thermal conduction .",

    "we assume the solar elemental abundance for the radiative cooling term . in sufficiently low density regions with @xmath78 g",
    "@xmath79 we use optically thin radiative loss , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are proton and electron number densities and @xmath83 is the tabulated cooling function by @xcite . in denser regions , which generally corresponds to low chromosphere , we adopt empirical radiative cooling , @xmath84 ( erg @xmath79s@xmath8 ) derived from observations of the solar chromosphere @xcite to take into account the optically thick effect . for simplicity",
    "s sake we switch off the cooling if temperature drops below 3000 k , which sometimes happens in the rgb stars .",
    "we might have to take into account effects of neutral atoms or dusts in such low temperature , though we do not do explicitly in this paper ( see  [ sec : lim ] ) .",
    "we adopt the second - order mhd - godunov - mocct scheme ( sano & inutsuka 2007 in preparation ; see also si06 ) to update the physical quantities . in this scheme each cell boundary is treated as a discontinuity , and for the time evolution we solve the nonlinear riemann shock tube problem with magnetic pressure by using the rankine - hugoniot relations .",
    "therefore , entropy generation , namely heating , is automatically calculated from the shock jump condition .",
    "a great advantage of our code is that no artificial viscosity is required even for strong mhd shocks ; numerical diffusion is suppressed to the minimum level for adopted numerical resolution .",
    "we describe the conditions of the stellar photospheres , which are the inner boundaries of the simulations .",
    "the density , @xmath85 , at photosphere ( defined as optical depth @xmath86 ) is subject to stellar parameters through various opacity effects in the atmosphere . the gas pressure , @xmath87 , at photosphere has a positive dependence on gravity , @xmath88 , for a given @xmath24 (  9 of gray 1992 ) .",
    "@xmath87 has a negative dependence on @xmath24 , and in the cool star condition ( 4000 k@xmath89 k ) the relation is roughly @xmath90 ( figure 9.21 of gray 1992 ) .",
    "then , @xmath85(@xmath91 ) can be scaled as @xmath92 we firstly set @xmath93 g @xmath79 on the sun and @xmath85 s in the other cases are determined by this scaling relation ; @xmath85 s in table [ tab : sttp ] are thus given s in table [ tab : sttp ] are slightly different ( @xmath94% ) from the values derived from equation ( [ eq : sfprs ] ) this is because @xmath85 s are set by the model atmosphere that is used to derive the approximated scaling of equation ( [ eq : sfprs ] ) . ] .",
    "the fluctuation amplitude , @xmath95 , at the photospheres can be estimated from convective flux .",
    "the generation of sound waves on late - type stars have been extensively studied ( lighthill 1952 ; stein 1967 ; de loore 1970 ; renzini et al .",
    "1977 ; bohn 1984 ; shibahashi 2005 ) .",
    "recently , numerical experiments of surface convection are also carried out @xcite .",
    "these works show a similar qualitative trend that the excited acoustic flux , @xmath96(erg @xmath97s@xmath8 ) , has a negative dependence on surface gravity and a positive dependence on stellar effective temperature . in this paper",
    "we adopt the relation derived by @xcite , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is wave amplitude , @xmath100 is sound speed , and @xmath101 denotes time - average .    strictly speaking , @xmath95 should be longitudinal ( parallel to the field line ; _ i.e. _ radial direction ) component . in this paper",
    "we assume both transverse and longitudinal components have the same amplitude at the photosphere .",
    "this assumption is roughly satisfied at least on the sun because observation of solar granulations shows that both transverse and longitudinal amplitudes are similar , @xmath102 km s@xmath8 @xcite .",

    "@xmath107 s in table [ tab : sttp ] are determined by this relation s in table [ tab : sttp ] are also slightly different from those based on equation ( [ eq : dvscl ] ) .",
    "this is again because we are using the model atmosphere when setting @xmath95 . ] .      the typical period , @xmath108 , of generated waves is also related to stellar parameters .",
    "@xmath108 can be scaled by eddy ( granulation cell ) turn - over timescale , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is a typical granulation size , if stochastic processes of the convection dominate in the wave generation .",
    "@xmath110 s are different in different stars , and are probably proportional to the pressure scale heights , @xmath111 . then",
    ", we have @xmath112 which is consistent with recent numerical simulations ( _ e.g. _ stein et al .",
    "we use equation ( [ eq : wpsc ] ) to give the realistic spectra of fluctuations at the photosphere . in this paper",
    ", we adopt a broadband power spectrum of @xmath113 with respect to frequency , @xmath114 , where the normalization is given by @xmath115 . for the present sun",
    ", we set @xmath116 min and @xmath117 min , giving the ( logarithmic ) mean value @xmath118 min , which dominates the solar oscillations .",
    "@xmath119 s and @xmath120 s of the other stars can be determined by the scaling relation of equation ( [ eq : wpsc ] ) as shown in table [ tab : sttp ] .",
    "it should be noted that a shape of @xmath121 affects wind structure little as long as the same @xmath119 and @xmath120 are adopted ( si06 ) .      in this paper",
    "we only consider the open field regions in which the ( unperturbed ) magnetic fields are oriented to the vertical direction at the surfaces .",
    "in such a situation , if we restrict waves traveling in the vertical direction , the transverse components of surface fluctuations produce waves , while the longitudinal component excites compressive waves , e.g. acoustic waves , or more generally , magnetosonic waves .",
    "the uncompressive character enables the waves to propagate long distance . on the other hand ,",
    "the longitudinal waves are quite dissipative because both nonlinear shock formation @xcite and collisionless dissipation @xcite are effective .",
    "thus , the compressive waves can not travel a sufficiently long distance to contribute to the acceleration of the winds @xcite . actually , we tested a role of longitudinal fluctuations in several models and found that its effect is limited in the regions near the surfaces ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "therefore , we only show the results of transverse fluctuations at the photospheres in this paper .",
    "we initially set up the static and cool atmospheres with the photospheric temperatures ; _ neither stellar winds nor hot coronae are set up in advance_. we start the simulations by injecting the transverse fluctuations from the photospheres , which excite waves ( see the _ electronic edition _ for the mpeg file of model vi which is the movie version of figure [ fig : mpw ] ) .",
    "the atmospheres are accelerated as transonic winds in all the six models by the dissipation of the waves (  [ sec : dwv ] ) .",
    "this shows that the transonic outflow is a stable and natural consequence of the wave - driven winds of both ms and rgb stars .",
    "the stellar winds are settled down to the quasi - steady states after @xmath34 twice of the sound crossing times of the entire simulation boxes ( the sound speeds are slower than the speeds in our simulations ) , although the rgb cases ( models iii - vi ) show large fluctuations in the winds by thermal instability (  [ sec : tdp ] ) .",
    "first we would like to briefly mention the main results of our simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : wdst ] presents the structure of temperature , @xmath123 ( k ) ( top ) , outflow velocity , @xmath124 ( km s@xmath8 ) ( middle ) , and density , @xmath64 ( g @xmath79 ) ( bottom ) on radial distances from the stellar centers in unit of @xmath23 .",
    "the quantities are averaged over sufficiently longer durations than @xmath120 of each model .",
    "figure [ fig : chp ] shows the typical wind parameters , temperature , @xmath123(k ) in the atmosphere ( top ) , wind speed , @xmath125 ( km s@xmath8 ) , at 20 @xmath15 ( middle ) , and mass loss rate , @xmath126 ( @xmath16 yr@xmath8 ) , evaluated at 20 @xmath15 ( bottom ) , as functions of @xmath127 ; evolved stars are in the left side .",
    "note that the super - radial expansions of the flux tubes finish in @xmath128 so the flux tubes are radially oriented at @xmath129 . in the top panel , we are averaging @xmath130 in 1.5 - 15 @xmath131 .",
    "the solid error bars correspond to the temperature ranges of the time - averaged structure in this region .",
    "the dashed error bars in all the panels correspond to the maximum and minimum values from the snap - shot results (  [ sec : tdp ] ) .",
    "one of the most important results is the disappearance of _ steady _ hot coronae in the rgb stars ( models iii - vi ) .",
    "it is clearly seen in the top panel of figure [ fig : chp ] that the average temperature drops suddenly from @xmath132k in the sub - giant star ( model ii ) to @xmath133k in the rgb stars .",
    "the large dashed error bars in the same panel indicate that the temperatures of the rgb atmospheres show large variations .",
    "one may also see in the middle and bottom panels that the velocities and mass loss rates of the rgb stars largely fluctuate . particularly , @xmath5 s of the rgb stars vary 2 - 4 orders of magnitude . therefore , the red giant winds are highly structured , in contrast to the steady coronal winds from the ms and sub - giant stars .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ fig : wdst ] shows that nearly - static regions are formed above the photospheres in the rgb stars , and the acceleration of the winds essentially starts from several stellar radii .",
    "accordingly , their wind speeds in the outer regions are considerably slower than the escape velocities at the surfaces ( the middle panel of figure [ fig : chp ] ) , which is consistent with the observed trend ( _ e.g. _ dupree ) .",
    "the mass loss rate rapidly increases from ms to rgb .",
    "the average @xmath5 s of the stars with @xmath134 are @xmath135yr@xmath8 , which are comparable to the observed level @xcite .",
    "we explain the mechanism of the disappearance of the steady corona in more detail .",
    "the main reason is that the sound speed ( @xmath136 km s@xmath8 ) of @xmath137 k plasma exceeds the escape speed , @xmath138 , at @xmath139 a few @xmath15 ; the hot corona can not be confined by the gravity any more in the atmospheres of the rgb stars . therefore , the material flows out before heated up to coronal temperature .",
    "however , the temperature gap at @xmath140 km s@xmath8 ( the top panel of figure [ fig : chp ] ) can not be explained only by this reason .",
    "thermal instability plays an important role in the drop of the temperature .",
    "the radiative cooling function of the optically thin gas with the solar abundance @xcite shows a decreasing trend on temperature in @xmath141 k , indicating that gas is less cooled as it is heated up .",
    "then , thermal instability sets in and gas in this temperature range can not stably exist @xcite .",
    "in solar and stellar coronal situations , however , thermal conduction plays a role in stabilization ; drastic heating to @xmath142 k is suppressed by the downward conduction from the upper corona to the lower chromosphere @xcite .",
    "then , gas with @xmath6 k becomes thermally stable , while gas with @xmath143 k , which is shown by the hatched region in figure [ fig : chp ] , remains unstable .",
    "let us think about comparison of @xmath144 and @xmath145 at a few @xmath15 of the @xmath18 stars .",
    "in models i and ii , @xmath145 exceeds @xmath144 ( @xmath146 km s@xmath8 ) of @xmath147 k plasma .",
    "under such a condition the coronal temperatures are determined by energy balance among heating , radiative cooling , and downward thermal conduction in the transition region which divides the chromosphere and the corona @xcite . however , in model iii(@xmath148 ) @xmath149 km s@xmath8 , and in model",
    "iv(@xmath134 ) @xmath150 km s@xmath8 , which correspond to sound speeds of plasmas with @xmath151 k and @xmath152 k , respectively . therefore , the gas streams out before heated up to the stable temperature ( @xmath153 k ) because of the insufficient confinement by the gravity .",
    "those temperatures are thermally unstable , and then , the actual temperatures become lower than the gravity limited values .",
    "this is the reason why the average temperatures of models iii  vi are not @xmath154 k but @xmath155 k. in conclusion , the thermal instability , in addition to the gravity effect , yields the sharp decline of the temperature from @xmath156 k to @xmath157 k with the stellar evolution .    the results ( figures [ fig : wdst ] & [ fig : chp ] ) show that the temperatures in the winds of the @xmath158 rgb stars are systematically higher than those of the @xmath18 counterparts .",
    "this is because the energy inputs from the surfaces are larger in more massive stars . when fixing surface gravity , a star with a larger mass has higher effective temperature , which gives a larger photospheric amplitude ( equation [ eq : dvscl ] )",
    "then , more energy is injected from the surface so that the larger heating is achieved .",
    "after the disappearance of the steady corona , the atmospheres and winds of the rgb stars show time - dependent behaviors because of the thermal instability . in this section",
    ", we examine the snap - shot structure of the red giant winds .",
    "we firstly show the results of model vi ( @xmath158 ) , which is redward of the dl but more active than the @xmath18 counterpart ( model iv ) . after that",
    ", we discuss the other rgb cases .",
    "figure [ fig : mpw ] shows the snap - shot wind structure of model vi at @xmath159(hr ) ( solid ) in comparison with the time - averaged structure ( dashed ) that is the same as in figure [ fig : wdst ] .",
    "the mpeg movie of the simulation is also available in the _",
    "electronic edition_. figure [ fig : mpw ] illustrates that the simple picture of layered atmosphere , photosphere  chromosphere  transition region  corona  wind from below , does not hold in the rgb star .",
    "a characteristic feature is that a number of hot bubbles with low densities are distributed in cool background material .",
    "for example , in an inner region ( @xmath160 ) the two bubbles with the peak temperatures @xmath161 k are seen ; in @xmath162 a couple of warm bubbles with @xmath163 k are formed .",
    "the hot and warm bubbles and the cool background materials are connected by the transition regions , at which the temperature drastically changes because of the thermal instability .",
    "the densities of the hot bubbles are lower than the ambient media to satisfy the pressure balance .",
    "as seen in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : mpw ] the density fluctuates typically by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude in the wind , which is related to the fact that the gas mainly consists of hot ( @xmath161 k ) and cool ( @xmath164 k ) components . strictly speaking",
    ", however , magnetic pressure also needs to be taken into account for the force balance (  [ sec : mhb ] ) .",
    "the outflow speed fluctuates as well to fulfill the mass conservation relation .",
    "the red giant wind is not a steady outward stream but an outflow consisting of many small - scale structures .",
    "our simulation shows that both hot plasma and cool chromospheric wind coexist in the rgb star , which is consistent with observations of hybrid stars @xcite .",
    "how are these hot bubbles formed ?",
    "how are the high temperatures maintained ?",
    "we study the formation and evolution of bubbles by inspecting one typical hot bubble that is indicated by the arrows in figure [ fig : mpw ] .",
    "this bubble is initially created at @xmath165 at @xmath166 hr .",
    "it comoves outwardly with the background flow and eventually cooled down to @xmath167 k at @xmath168 hr at @xmath169 ( see the mpeg movie of figure [ fig : mpw ] available in the _ electronic edition _ ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mhb ] presents the zoomed - in structure just after the formation of the bubble ( the lower panels ) with schematic cartoon ( top ) .",
    "the location of the shock front , which plays a role in the heating of the bubble , is indicated by the dotted line at @xmath170 in the panels .",
    "the top and middle panels show @xmath171(@xmath172 ; magnetic pressure ) , @xmath66 , @xmath124 , @xmath123 and @xmath64 .",
    "in the bottom panel , we present heating rate per mass . the solid line indicates the net heating rate that is calculated from local change of specific heat , @xmath173 , and the dashed line shows the heating by the only mhd process which excludes radiative cooling and thermal conduction from @xmath173 .",
    "as clearly seen in the bottom panel the heating rate is not smoothly distributed but largely fluctuates because the heating mainly occurs at the steepened fronts of waves ( see  [ sec : dwv ] ) .",
    "radiative cooling is also important ; in some portions the net heating becomes negative ( the solid lines disappears ) in spite of the positive mhd heating ( dashed line ) , because the radiative cooling exceeds the mhd heating .",
    "this large variation of the heating rate by waves and cooling triggers the multi - temperature stellar wind .",
    "@xmath171 increases at the shock front from the upstream ( right ) side to the downstream ( left ) side , which indicates that this is a fast mhd shock .",
    "one may find the density peak just behind the shock front .",
    "this is because an effective ratio of specific heats is small @xmath174 owing to the thermal conduction ; the density jump at the shock becomes large in small @xmath175 circumstances so that the material should be concentrated in the narrow region behind the shock to satisfy the mass conservation @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the radiative cooling dominates the mhd heating owing to the high density , and this region is cooled down to form a cool dense shell ( the bottom panel of figure [ fig : mhb ] ) . behind this cool dense shell , the hot region ,",
    "which was heated up by the fast mhd shock , remains .",
    "the fast mhd shock plays an important role in maintaining this hot bubble . because the magnetic field is generated by the shock , the magnetic pressure in the bubble is larger than in the ambient gas . therefore , the hot bubble is not supported by the gas pressure but by the magnetic pressure .",
    "even though the gas pressure decreases by an occasional cooling , the bubble can avoid being compressed .",
    "the density is kept low to reduce the radiative loss as well as to increase the heating rate per mass .",
    "the hot bubble survives much longer time than ambient ( average ) cooling time until the magnetic topology changes ; the high temperature is maintained around 315hr , while a typical cooling time , @xmath176 , of gas with @xmath177k ( @xmath178erg @xmath179s@xmath8 ; see  [ sec : siml ] ) is @xmath180 to summarize , hot bubbles are initially created by the variations of heating rate , and their high temperature is maintained thanks to the support by magnetic pressure .",
    "an intriguing concept of magnetized hot bubbles is that hot plasma can be heated up even in open field regions .",
    "it has been generally considered that closed loops are necessary to confine hot plasma in the atmosphere of a rgb star since the gravity is not sufficiently strong .",
    "however , our simulations show that the hot bubble can exist rather long time ( @xmath181 days ) by magnetic topology , _",
    "i.e. _ a fast mhd shock , in open field regions .",
    "it is supposed that such hot bubbles are ubiquitously created and they are possible sources of continuous soft x - ray emissions in hybrid stars as discussed later (  [ sec : rdl ] ) .      because the red giant wind consists of many small - scale structures , the mass loss rate and the outflow speed in the outer region also show time - dependent behaviors .",
    "figure [ fig : mdtdp ] presents @xmath5 ( @xmath16 yr@xmath8 ) ( upper ) and @xmath182 ( km s@xmath8 ) ( lower ) .",
    "the upper panel shows @xmath5 varies more than three orders of magnitude from @xmath183 to @xmath184 @xmath16 yr@xmath8 .",
    "the lower panel also shows that @xmath182 largely varies from @xmath185 km s@xmath8 to @xmath186 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the jumps are seen in @xmath5 and @xmath187 at @xmath188 , and 9020 hr .",
    "these jumps indicate that dense blobs pass at @xmath189 at those times .",
    "we examine one of the blobs which passes at @xmath190 hr ( this blob is seen in figure [ fig : mpw ] as well ) .",
    "this is a shock wave originally formed in an inner region .",
    "the shock amplitude has been initially small , but it grows as the shock moves outward by sweeping - up a number of smaller dense blobs as well as by amplification in the stratified atmosphere with the decreasing density .",
    "finally the compression ratio of the shock increases to more than 10 .",
    "( this value exceeds the adiabatic limit @xmath191 since our simulations , which take into account cooling and thermal conduction , are not adiabatic . )",
    "before this shock arrives , @xmath5 is almost constant and @xmath187 shows smoother feature . after the shock reaches @xmath192 , both @xmath5 and @xmath187 show fluctuating behaviors .",
    "this is because the downstream region contains larger perturbation than the upstream region .",
    "hot bubbles in rgb atmospheres become sources of soft x - ray and extreme uv ( euv ) radiation that is observed in hybrid stars .",
    "we present the radiative fluxes , normalized by the bolometric luminosity , from the entire star of models vi as functions of time in figure [ fig : radfl3 ] .",
    "the blue , green and red lines are the radiative fluxes from the gas with @xmath193 ( optical ; chromosphere ) , @xmath194 k ( uv ; transition region ) and @xmath195 ( euv / soft x - ray ; corona ) .",
    "we call them cool , warm , and hot components , respectively",
    ". we also plot the radiative flux of the gas with @xmath196 k , which is a part of the hot component and corresponds to soft x - ray emission .",
    "when deriving the radiative fluxes from the entire star , we assume spherical symmetry : @xmath197 where @xmath198 and @xmath199 are the minimum and maximum temperatures of each component .",
    "while our simulations only treat the open magnetic field regions , in reality a certain fraction of the surface is covered by closed structures .",
    "equation ( [ eq : radfl ] ) assumes that the radiative fluxes from both open and closed regions have the same @xmath68 dependence .",
    "although this treatment is not strictly correct , we can give rough estimates .    according to the upper panel of figure [ fig : radfl3 ] ,",
    "the hot component shows strong intermittent activities , while the cool component , which dominates the total radiative flux , stays roughly constant within @xmath200 .",
    "the behavior of the warm component is between the cool and hot ones ; when the hot component is switched - off or stays in low activity phases ( _ e.g. _ @xmath201 hr ) @xmath202 , but once the hot component becomes active , @xmath203 increases to @xmath204 by the contributions from the transition regions of hot bubbles .",
    "it is also shown that the hot bubbles with @xmath196 k exist during the only half of the presented duration .",
    "however , we should note that this is based on the spherical symmetry approximation .",
    "in reality , hot bubbles are created in different open flux tubes at different times , and they are ubiquitously distributed in the atmosphere to be continuous soft x - ray sources .    when discussing observed x - ray flux , we need to take into account the absorption by hydrogen in the outer cool chromospheric wind@xcite",
    ". then , the observed flux of the hot component would be smaller than that shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : radfl3 ] .",
    "in particular , soft x - ray radiation is supposed to severely suffer the absorption since most of the hot bubbles with @xmath205k are distributed in the inner region ( @xmath206 ) . in the lower panel of figure [ fig : radfl3 ]",
    "we compare the observed soft x - ray flux ( @xmath196 k ) that takes into account the absorption ( solid ) with the original flux ( dashed ) .",
    "tenfold obscuration of the soft x - ray emissions sets in at column density , @xmath207 @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the most optimistic case of @xmath208 @xmath79 : @xmath209 when deriving @xmath210 from the simulation result , we only consider the gas with @xmath211 k to pick up neutral hydrogen and assume the solar abundance .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : radfl3 ] illustrates that most of the soft x - ray emissions are absorbed . around @xmath212 and 8000 hr",
    ", the soft x - ray could be observed , and the @xmath213 is reduced to @xmath214 from @xmath215 .",
    "interestingly , this value , @xmath216 , is typical for hybrid stars ( e.g. ayres 2005 ) , although our calculation , which is based on 1d and do not consider detailed radiative processes , is too simplified for further quantitative arguments .",
    "we have examined the time - dependent behaviors of the @xmath217 red giant wind ( model vi ) . in this subsection",
    "we study the @xmath18 stars on both blueward ( model iii ) and redward ( model iv ) sides of the dl .",
    "figure [ fig : tdpd1 m ] shows the snap - shot temperature structure and the time - variation of the radiative fluxes of models iii and iv .",
    "the upper panels ( temperature ) show that the atmospheres and winds of the @xmath218 rgb stars also consist of many hot and warm bubbles embedded in the cool chromospheric materials .",
    "it is confirmed that rgb winds are generally structured with many blobs and bubbles .",
    "the temperature of bubbles are lower in the more evolved star ( model iv ) .",
    "this trend is also clearly seen in the plots of the radiative fluxes ( the lower panels ) .",
    "the emission from the hot gas ( @xmath219 k ) exists only during the short term ( @xmath220 hr ) in model vi , while the hot bubbles with @xmath219 k almost always exist in model iii .",
    "namely , once a star with @xmath18 crosses the dl , euv / soft x - ray emissions from hot plasma with @xmath219 k happen to disappear . however , the qualitative wind features , hot / warm bubbles in cool materials , are similar in models iii and iv . both temperature and the number of hot bubbles decrease with the evolution from models iii to iv , because the heating rate per mass decreases on account of the increase of the density in the atmosphere ( figure [ fig : wdst ] ) .",
    "the emission levels of the hot components of the @xmath18 stars are smaller than that of the @xmath158 star .",
    "this is because @xmath95 ( table [ tab : sttp ] ) of the surface convection is smaller in a less massive star owing to the lower @xmath24 ( equation [ eq : dvscl ] ) .",
    "our result is consistent with the observed trend that uv / x - ray emission of rgb stars are positively correlated with stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the average emission level of the hot component of model iii is @xmath221 , which is marginally smaller than the typical observed x - ray flux ( @xmath222 ; e.g. ayres 2005 ) from rgb stars blueward of the dl .",
    "moreover , the emissions are mostly from the bubbles with @xmath223(k ) in our simulation , corresponding to euv rather than soft - x ray emissions , and the effect of the absorption will further reduce the observed flux .",
    "then , it would be difficult to explain the observed x - ray from rgb stars before crossing the dl by only the hot bubbles in open field regions .",
    "probably , hot plasma , which is efficiently confined in closed magnetic loops , also contribute to the x - ray emission .",
    "incidently , @xcite speculated that the dl was reflection of the change of magnetic topology ; as a star crosses the dl , the magnetic structure becomes open and the hot plasma is liberated to be x - ray deficient ( see  [ sec : unc ] ) .",
    "the wind velocity also drastically decreases along with the stellar evolution as shown in figure [ fig : chp ] . as briefly stated previously , this is mainly because the nearly static regions are formed above the photospheres in the rgb stars and the winds are essentially accelerated from the effective surfaces located several @xmath15 .",
    "we see this in more detail here . in order to investigate the drastic change of the wind speed",
    ", we compare models near the transition at @xmath224 km s@xmath8 ( the top panel of figure [ fig : chp ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dnst ] shows the simulated density structure ( solid ) of models ii ( left ) , v ( middle ) , and iii ( right ) , in comparison with the density structure based on hydrostatic equilibrium ( dotted ) and that derived from assumed constant velocities ( dashed ) .",

    "we set @xmath226 at the coronal base ( model ii ) or the locations where the average temperatures start to increase ( models iii & v ) .",
    "note that @xmath234 in these models ( see figure [ fig : chrm ] in  [ sec : chm ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dnst ] shows that the densities in the subsonic ( inner ) regions can be approximated by the hydrostatic structure , which is consistent with the result of general stellar wind theory ( _ e.g. _ section 3 of lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) .",
    "this indicates that the atmospheres are supported by both magnetic and gas pressure .",
    "the dashed lines plot @xmath235 which is derived from substituting constant @xmath236 into the steady - state continuity equation of mass , @xmath237const .",
    "the starting point is set in the low chromosphere in each model . because in model ii ( the left panel ) the density decreases faster due to the stronger gravity , the dashed line is far above the solid as well as dotted lines .",
    "this indicates the acceleration of the wind should start near the surface .",
    "on the other hand , in models iii ( the right panel ) the decrease of the density is slower since the gravity is weaker . as a result , the solid line follows the dashed line in the inner region , which indicates that the wind is not accelerated , but stays almost a constant speed .",
    "the solid line is gradually diverging from the dashed line around @xmath238 several @xmath15 , which we call an `` effective '' surface , and at which the wind starts to be practically accelerated . in @xmath239 ,",
    "the average wind speed is kept much slower than 10 km s@xmath8(@xmath240 ) , and the atmosphere is almost static , as seen in figure [ fig : wdst ] ; the acceleration is not effective there because of too much material .",
    "the longitudinal motions seen in this region in the top panel of figure [ fig : wdst ] are not by outflow but due to compressive waves (  [ sec : dwv ] ) .",
    "the wind structure of the other rgb stars ( models iv and vi ) is essentially similar to that of model iii .",
    "the gravity is smaller at @xmath241 than at the surface , hence the slow wind can escape outwardly .",
    "therefore , we can expect that the terminal velocity is not an order of the surface escape speed but an order of the escape speed , @xmath242 , at @xmath241 .",
    "this can explain why observed wind speeds are much smaller than the surface escape velocities in rgb stars ( _ e.g. _ dupree 1986 ) . in model iii we can set @xmath243 , hence , @xmath244 km s@xmath8 .",
    "this value is an order of the terminal velocity which is supposed to be slightly faster than the obtained @xmath245 km s@xmath8 when the effect of the acceleration in @xmath246 is taken into account .",
    "the situation of model v ( the middle panel ) is between models ii and iii .",
    "the simulated density follows the trend of the non - acceleration at the beginning .",
    "however , the solid line departs from the dashed line earlier than in model iii . in this case",
    "the wind becomes gradually accelerated from a few @xmath15 .",
    "setting @xmath247 , we have @xmath248 km s@xmath8 which is an order of the obtained @xmath249 .",
    "the difference between models iii and v arises from the difference of the radii ; although these two models have the same @xmath250 , the decrease of the density is faster in model v when measured in @xmath251 , ( @xmath252 is larger in equation [ eq : isdns ] ) .    in concluding , we have the natural conclusion that the wind speed is determined by the escape speed at @xmath241 where the wind practically starts to flow out",
    ". @xmath253 does not coincide with the stellar surface but moves outward as a star expands .",
    "therefore , the wind speeds of the rgb stars are slower than the surface escape speeds .",
    "the main energy that drives the stellar winds is the turbulent energy of the surface convection in our simulations .",
    "the waves that are excited by the footpoint motions of open flux tubes carry the energy outwardly and the dissipation of the waves leads to the heating and acceleration of the stellar winds . in this subsection",
    ", we quantitatively investigate the energetics of the stellar winds driven by waves , and finally determine the mass loss rate in a _ forward _ manner .",
    "we study the structure of lower atmosphere because it is important not only in determining the basal properties of the stellar winds but in controling the reflection of the waves . in figure",
    "[ fig : chrm ] we show the time - averaged density ( top ) and temperature ( middle ) which are the same as in figure [ fig : wdst ] but plotted on @xmath254 to enlarge the inner regions .",

    "@xmath256 are plotted .    in the ms ( model i ) and sub - giant ( model ii ) cases , the steady corona lies above the ( geometrically ) thin chromosphere and these two regions are divided by the sharp transition region . in the rgb cases ( models iii - vi ) ,",
    "the temperature gradually increases outwardly from the chromosphere .",
    "this increase of the temperature is different from the formation of `` warm corona '' but the result of the time - average of intermittent creation of hot bubbles ; the location at which the temperature increases is the starting point of the formation of hot bubbles .",
    "however , it is still worth studying the average trend from an energetics point of view .",
    "the lower panel illustrates that the variations of @xmath255 s are qualitatively similar in the stars with @xmath257 ; the @xmath255 values decrease outwardly to @xmath258 but turn to increase from certain locations .",
    "this is because when the magnetic pressure dominates the gas pressure by @xmath2591000 times , the dissipation of a small fraction of magnetic energy gives an enormous effect on the gas .",
    "indeed , the energy transfer from the magnetic fields to the plasmas is carried by the dissipation of the waves in our simulations and the gas is heated up before @xmath255 becomes further smaller .",
    "as the temperatures rise , the decreases of the densities become slower ( equation [ eq : isdns ] ) and @xmath255 s increase due to the decreases of @xmath260 s .",
    "the densities at which the average temperatures start to increase are controlled in order that the plasma @xmath255 values do not become too small . the geometrical depth of the inner chromosphere ( the region between the photosphere and the location of temperature rise ) is larger in a lower @xmath261 star since the decrease of density is slower .    in the stars with @xmath134",
    ", the @xmath255 values do not become as small as the other cases since the decreases of the densities in the low chromospheres are too slow to achieve such small @xmath255 s .",
    "therefore , strong heating do not occur and the average temperatures are lower than the higher gravity stars .    in",
    "the @xmath17 stars the temperatures start to increas from more inner positions than in the @xmath218 counterparts .",
    "this is because a more massive star gives larger photospheric amplitude and input energy of waves ( equation [ eq : dvscl ] ) .",
    "then , hot bubbles are heated up from a deeper ( _ i.e. _ denser ) region .      in si05 and si06 , we claimed that the nonlinear generation of mhd slow ( @xmath262 sound ) waves is the main dissipation process in our 1d simulation of the solar wind ; the energy of waves is transferred to the slow waves , which dissipate by shocks after steepening of the wave fronts .",
    "we show that the same mechanism operates in rgb stars at least under the 1d approximation .",
    "we firstly inspect the dissipation processes by using the results of model iii , and after that , we compare the four cases of the @xmath18 stars ( models i - iv ) .",
    "we are injecting the broadband spectra of the surface fluctuations and in the upper regions not only outgoing but incoming waves of different modes travel simultaneously .",
    "hence , the actual simulations show turbulence - like feature ( _ e.g. _ see @xmath263 in the movie of figure [ fig : mpw ] available in _ electric edition _ ) .",
    "a technic of the mode decomposition @xcite is a useful tool to study such turbulent phenomena .",
    "figure [ fig : wac ] plots the following adiabatic constants derived from wave action @xcite , @xmath264 for outgoing alfvn , incoming alfvn , and outgoing slow mhd ( sound ) waves of model iii as functions of distance , where @xmath265 and @xmath266 are amplitude and phase speed of each wave mode . in our simple 1d geometry , waves are purely transverse and slow mhd waves are purely longitudinal ; the energy flux of waves is calculated from @xmath263 and @xmath267 , and the energy flux of slow mhd waves is from fluctuating components of @xmath124 and @xmath64 .",
    "a characteristic feature of incoming ( outgoing ) waves is that @xmath263 and @xmath267 are in ( in opposite ) phase .",
    "the decomposition of each wave mode can be done by using these facts .",
    "the subscript , @xmath268 , denotes that @xmath269 is normalized at @xmath270 where the flux tubes expand by @xmath271 , to exclude the effect of the adiabatic loss .",
    "@xmath272 can be used as a measure of the dissipation . although @xmath272 and energy flux are identical in static media , they are different in moving media .",
    "@xmath272 is conserved in expanding atmosphere if a wave does not dissipate , while it is not the case for the energy flux . for the incoming wave ,",
    "we plot the opposite sign of @xmath272 so that it becomes positive in the sub - region .",
    "figure [ fig : wac ] shows that the outgoing waves dissipate quite effectively ; @xmath273 becomes only @xmath258 of the initial value at the outer boundary .",
    "first , a sizable amount is reflected back quite near the surface , which is clearly illustrated as the incoming wave that is following the outgoing component with a slightly smaller level .",
    "this is because the wave shape is considerably deformed owing to the steep density gradient . in this region ,",
    "the temperature is small , @xmath274 k , which gives a short pressure scale height , @xmath275 ( figure [ fig : chrm ] ) .",
    "then , the wavelength of the waves becomes comparable or longer than @xmath275 , which results in the effective reflection of the waves @xcite . in this model iii ,",
    "more than 60% of the initial energy flux of the waves are reflected back before reaching the upper warm region with the _ average _ temperature , @xmath276 k (  [ sec : eng ] ) .",
    "second , slow mhd waves are generated in the corona ( see sakurai et al.2002 for solar observation ) as shown in figure [ fig : wac ] .",
    "the generation of the slow waves is triggered by the variation of the magnetic pressure , @xmath277 , with the waves @xcite .",
    "this excites density perturbations , which are slow mhd waves in magnetically dominated plasma .",
    "slow waves are generally longitudinal , and then , they eventually suffer nonlinear steepening to lead to shock dissipation @xcite .",
    "the density fluctuations of slow waves also work as mirrors to waves .",
    "the variation of the density directly leads to the variation of the speeds ( @xmath278 ) , which enhances the reflection of the waves by the deformation of the shape .",
    "these reflected waves further nonlinearly interact with the pre - existing outgoing waves , which plays a role in the dissipation .",
    "the process discussed here is the parametric decay instability of waves due to three - wave ( outgoing alfvn , incoming alfvn , and outgoing slow waves ) interactions ( goldstein 1978 ; terasawa et al . 1986 ) .",
    "the decay instability is not generally efficient in the homogeneous background since it is a nonlinear mechanism .",
    "therefore , it has not been considered as a major process of the acceleration of the solar and stellar winds . however , the density gradient of the background plasma totally changes the situation .",
    "the amplitude , @xmath263 , of waves is inevitably amplified with the decreasing density to conserve @xmath279 . on the other hand , the speed , @xmath280(@xmath278 ) ,",
    "does not increase so much because the decrease of @xmath27 ( flux tube expansion ) compensates the decrease of @xmath64 . as a result ,",
    "the nonlinearity ( @xmath281 ) increases as the waves travel upwardly ( see figure [ fig : wvcmp ] ) , which leads to efficient dissipation .",
    "figure [ fig : wvcmp ] compares the dissipation of the waves in the four models of the 1 @xmath16 stars . in the upper panel @xmath282 s",
    "are compared , and in the lower panel nonlinearities , @xmath283 , are shown , where @xmath284 .",
    "the figure shows that the wave energies drastically attenuate just above the surfaces in higher gravity stars because of the reflection in the chromospheres . in these stars",
    "the densities decrease more rapidly in the inner chromospheres , leading to the increases of @xmath280 s .",
    "then , the wavelength of the wave with the typical frequency ( e.g. several min . in model",
    "i ) becomes longer than @xmath285 which itself is substantially smaller for larger @xmath250 .",
    "this enhances the reflection as explained above .",
    "furthermore , in stronger gravity stars , the chromospheres are geometrically thin ( @xmath286 ) .",
    "otherwise if the chromosphere extends to @xmath287 as in the rgb stars , a curvature effect increases @xmath288 by @xmath251 ( equation [ eq : isdns ] ) , which reduces the wave reflection .",
    "this is also a reason why the reflection becomes relatively important in the higher gravity stars .",
    "finally , only less than half of the input wave energies can go beyond the inner chromospheres in models i - iii (  [ sec : eng ] ) .",
    "let us turn to the waves in the outer regions .",
    "wave dissipation is more rapid in lower gravity stars .",
    "this is because the densities in the atmopsheres are larger in those stars due to the longer @xmath288 and accordingly the speeds , @xmath289 , becomes slower .",
    "in such a condition waves more easily become nonliear ( @xmath290 in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : wvcmp ] ) , which enhances the wave dissipation .",
    "then , one may expect that the wave energies are more effectively transferred to the winds in more evolved stars .",
    "however , the situation is not so simple because in these stars radiative losses become efficient due to the higher densities .",
    "we study the wind energetics to discuss these issues in the next subsection .    before closing this subsetion",
    "we would like to remark on dissipation lenghts of the waves .",
    "since the dissipation processes of waves are quite complicated , a simpliphied phenomenological approach has been often adopted to treat waves in solar and stellar wind models ( _ e.g. _ hartmann & macgregor 1980 ) ; an action of waves is assumed to follow @xmath291 where @xmath110 is a ( constant ) dissipation length ( @xmath292 ) .",
    "we can directly estimate @xmath110 from our simulations .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : wvcmp ] illustrates that the decreases of @xmath282 s are roughly on straight lines in the @xmath293 diagram .",
    "this means that the dissipation lengths increase on @xmath68 .",
    "for example , in model iv @xmath294 in @xmath295 , but @xmath296 in @xmath297 ; the assumption of a constant dissipation length is not appropriate .",
    "a fraction of the initial wave energy is used for the acceleration of the stellar winds , while the rest of them is lost by radiation and returned back to the stellar surface by counter propagating waves .",
    "we estimate kinetic energy fluxes of the stellar winds at the outer boundaries , integrated radiative losses , and wave energy fluxes leaking inward from the stellar surfaces , respectively , in unit of erg / s : @xmath298 @xmath299 @xmath300 where @xmath301 denotes amplitude of incoming waves , and subscripts ` @xmath302 ' and ` out ' indicate that the values are evaluated at the stellar surfaces and the outer boundaries , respectively . here",
    ", we do not discuss energy carried by waves , enthalpy , and thermal conduction away from the outer boundaries because their contributions are smaller .",
    "figure [ fig : engfrc ] presents these energies normalized by the input energy fluxes from the surfaces , @xmath303 as functions of @xmath127 .",
    "as one can see , the fractions of the wave energies that are converted to the wind kinetic energies are small .",
    "typically , only @xmath259 1 % of the surface turbulent energies are transferred to the stellar winds . however , these tiny fractions are enough to keep the observed @xmath5 and @xmath304 of the winds from ms and rgb stars .",
    "most of the energy is lost by the radiation and the wave reflection . in the less evolved stars ( models i - iii ) ,",
    "the energy losses are dominated by the wave reflection as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : dwv ] ; the densities decrease more rapidly because of the higher gravity , and then , the wavelengths become longer than the scale heights , which results in the effective reflection via the deformation of the wave shape .",
    "the rapid decreases of the densities also make the radiative cooling less effective ; it is important only in the chromospheres ( @xmath305 k ) and low coronae where the densities are sufficiently high ( volumetric radiative cooling is @xmath306 in optically thin and @xmath307 in optically thick gas ) .",
    "this also leads to the relative dominance of the wave reflection in the total energy loss . on the other hand ,",
    "the trend of the most evolved star ( model iv ) is opposite since the decrease of the density is more gradual ; radiative cooling becomes relatively important first because it is efficient even in the outer region and second because the waves do not suffer the reflection so much .",
    "let us turn back to the kinetic energy part .",
    "the tendency on @xmath127 is not monochromatic . from model i ( ms ; @xmath308 km s@xmath8 ) to ii ( sub - giant ; @xmath309 km s@xmath8 ) , the fraction of the kinetic energy increases mainly because the mass flux , @xmath310 , increases",
    ". however , the fraction drops almost by one order of magnitude from models ii to iii ( @xmath311 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "this is because of the drastic decrease of the wind speed ( figure [ fig : chp ] ) .",
    "although the density increases from models ii to iii , the effect of the velocity dominates since the kinetic energy flux is proportional to @xmath312 . from models iii to iv ( @xmath313 km s@xmath8 ) , the decrease of @xmath124 is small , and the fraction of the kinetic energy again increases simply by the increase of the density .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : chp ] shows the mass loss rate of the @xmath218 star rapidly increases by @xmath314 orders of magnitude from ms to rgb phases .",
    "however , the increase of @xmath5 is continuous , which is in contrast to the velocity and temperature showing the gaps between the sub - giant and rgb stars .",
    "this is because the density in the wind drastically rises during this phase , which compensate the rapid decrease of the wind speed .    since our simulations adopt a _",
    "forward _ approach , @xmath5 is not an input parameter but an output directly determined from the simulations .",
    "therefore , it is straightforward to study how @xmath5 evolves with the stellar evolution from the wind energetics .",
    "we begin by comparing our results with the empirical relation by @xcite : @xmath315 where @xmath316 is a proportional coefficient of an order of unity .",
    "this is based on a dimensional analysis of stellar wind energetics .",
    "the filled symbols in figure [ fig : reim ] compares the obtained @xmath5 with the @xmath317 for @xmath318 .",
    "the comparison indicates that the reimers relation roughly gives reasonable estimates",
    ". however , smaller @xmath319 seems to be systematically favored in the higher gravity stars . to search a better relation , we investigate the mechanism that controls @xmath5 from the energetics of our alfvn - wave driven wind simulations . in the wave - driven winds , the radiation part ( @xmath320 )",
    "should be replaced by wave energy in equation ( [ eq : rei ] ) . in an open flux tube ,",
    "a fraction , @xmath321 , of the initial energy flux of input wave is transferred to the stellar wind where @xmath321 is exactly what has been derived in  [ sec : eng ] ( figure [ fig : engfrc ] ) .",
    "this can be written as @xmath322 where @xmath323 is wave energy flux .",
    "the left - hand side is evaluated at the surface and the right - hand side is at a sufficiently distant location at which @xmath324 and @xmath325 .",
    "multiplied by @xmath326 , a transformation of equation ( [ eq : wvwde ] ) gives @xmath327 where @xmath328 is wave luminosity and @xmath329 .",
    "here @xmath330 is used instead of @xmath331 because the fraction of the area occupied by open field regions at the surface is @xmath332 .",
    "then , an equation that determines @xmath5 becomes @xmath333 where we add subscript w to distinguish from @xmath317 and the simulated @xmath5 .",
    "although @xmath321 varies on @xmath127 , we have almost constant @xmath334 because @xmath335 is positively correlated with @xmath321 as shown in figure [ fig : engfrc ] . as for the wave luminosity",
    ", we can use the scaling relations of equations ( [ eq : sfprs ] ) and ( [ eq : dvscl ] ) , and then , @xmath336 where @xmath337 is the stephan boltzmann constant , subscript , @xmath338 , denotes the solar values , and we are using the same @xmath339(@xmath340 g ) in all the models .    substituting equations ( [ eq : eps ] ) and ( [ eq : lrt ] ) into equation ( [ eq : mslsd ] )",
    ", we finally have @xmath341 in @xmath16yr@xmath8 , where we leave a degree of freedom in @xmath342 , similarly to the reimers relation ( equation [ eq : rei ] ) since @xmath321 is not a constant . note that the dependences of @xmath250 and @xmath24 in equation ( [ eq : mswv1 ] ) are from the dependences of the energy flux of the generated sound waves by @xcite ( equation [ eq : acfsc ] ) ; if we used other results by _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , which give slightly different dependences , the scaling relations of @xmath343 would be also slightly different .",
    "@xmath344 does not have dependence on the properties of magnetic fields since we assume a constant @xmath339(@xmath340 g ) in equation ( [ eq : lrt ] ) . in more realistic situations ,",
    "however , @xmath339 would show star - to - star variation , and @xmath344 would have dependence on the magnetic fields .",
    "the open symbols in figure [ fig : reim ] compares the simulated @xmath5 and @xmath344 .",
    "one can see that most of the data points are distributed near @xmath345 .",
    "while the reimers formula , mainly targeting more luminous red giants , does not give good @xmath5 estimates for the less evolved stars ( filled symbol ; equation [ eq : rei ] ) , our scaling gives a better explanation to these stars .",
    "then , the scaling of equation ( [ eq : mswv ] ) can connect the mass loss rate of less evolved stars to that of more evolved ones that can be handled by the reimers formula .",
    "@xcite also proposed a formula of mass loss rates of wave - drive winds , focusing on more evolved stars . in their formula ,",
    "additional dependences on @xmath250 and @xmath24 also appear , while they are different from ours .",
    "when performing the simulations , we have to set up in advance the surface fluctuations and the magnetic flux tubes . while we can reasonably estimate the amplitude and period ( spectrum ) of the surface fluctuations from the conditions of the convection zones (  [ sec : phfl ] ) , there are large uncertainties in the properties of the magnetic fields .",
    "we only consider the open magnetic field regions because our aim is to study the stellar winds .",
    "we assume the same magnetic field strength ( @xmath35 g ) at the surface and expansion factor ( @xmath36 ) in the different stars .",
    "although it is unclear how in reality the open magnetic flux tubes are , we had better consider effects of different flux tubes ( see @xcite for configurations of flux tubes ) .",
    "we have actually studied the effects of the strength and configuration of magnetic flux tubes on the solar wind by both numerical simulations ( si06 ) and analytical method @xcite .",
    "we showed that @xmath339 is a more important parameter in controling solar wind properties than individual @xmath30 and @xmath54 , if nonlinear waves dominantly work in the acceleration .",
    "this is also consistent with recent observation by @xcite .",
    "for example , flux tubes with different @xmath30 and @xmath54 but the same ratio @xmath339 give similar wind properties if the photospheric amplitudes are the same .",
    "an input energy flux is @xmath346 at the surface , and it is diluted according to @xmath347 in an expanding flux tube .",
    "the acceleration of the stellar wind mainly occurs in the outer region where the super - radial expansion of the flux tube already finishes .",
    "therefore , @xmath339 , which is proportional to @xmath282 ( @xmath262energy flux ) of the input wave _ measured at the outer region _ , becomes an important control parameter in the wave - driven wind .",
    "moreover , a mass flux , _ i.e. _ @xmath5 , is determined almost solely by @xmath348 , and very weakly dependent on @xmath339 ( si06 ) . then , @xmath339 plays a role only in tuning the terminal velocity of the solar wind .",
    "this argument is directly applicable to red giant winds .",
    "@xmath5 s of the stellar winds ( the top panel of figure [ fig : chp ] ) are determined with little uncertainty since they are mainly determined by @xmath348 of the surface convections . however",
    ", when we discuss the wind terminal speeds , @xmath339 needs to be taken carefully ; wind speed becomes faster in a flux tube with larger @xmath339 .",
    "@xmath349 corresponds to the total magnetic flux over the whole open field regions divided by the entire stellar surface . to discuss the average field strength we have to take into account closed regions , which occupy a sizable fraction of the surface .",
    "if 10% of the surface is occupied by open field regions , the average strength becomes 10 times , namely 10 g .",
    "this value is quite reasonable from an energetics point of view .",
    "the magnetic energy density at the surface is @xmath350 erg @xmath79 , which is considerably smaller than the kinetic energy of the surface turbulence , @xmath351 erg @xmath79 , of the simulated stars .",
    "it is sufficient only if @xmath352 % of the turbulent energy is converted to the magnetic energy by motions of charged particles ( _ i.e. _ current ) in the surface convection .",
    "related to this , @xcite tried to interpret the dl by the change of magnetic topologies .",
    "the stellar rotation becomes slow with the evolution so that the generation of magnetic fields by large - scale dynamo is switched - off .",
    "magnetic fields are generated only by ( small - scale ) turbulent convection in the surface layers in evolved stars . as a result ,",
    "closed fields , which have dominantly covered the surface in unevolved stars , become open in evolved stars redward of the dl .",
    "therefore , hot plasma , which has been well confined by closed loops , would flow out .",
    "if this scenario is correct , surface field strength , @xmath30 , becomes smaller in evolved stars .",
    "however , we expect that the field strength in the outer regions ( @xmath353 ) is less affected , because an decrease of @xmath30 firstly reduces a fraction of closed structures rather than strength of open fields in the outer region ; even if @xmath30 decreases , @xmath354 stays more or less constant before all the field lines become open . because @xmath339 is more important than @xmath30 as stated above , we anticipate that our results of the stellar winds are affected little even if the magnetic field topologies change with the stellar evolution .",
    "@xcite investigated stellar winds from late - type stars with explicitly taking into account the effects of waves .",
    "they calculated several stars with different wave energies and dissipation parameters under the steady - state condition from assumed inner boundaries .",
    "they concluded that the dissipation of waves resulted in coronal heating in higher gravity stars ( ms and sub - giant ) and mass loss in lower gravity stars ( rgb ) .",
    "our analysis of the time - average wind structures basically confirm this tendency , whereas our simulations have revealed the various important time - dependent aspects (  [ sec : tdp ] ) .",
    "most of previous works claim that it is difficult to accelerate slow and dense red giant winds by waves @xcite the main problem is that a sizable amount of the input wave energy remains in the supersonic region , which leads to faster wind .",
    "there is also a similar problem in the concept of a supersonic transition locus , which @xcite introduced to explain the onset of massive wind .",
    "the main difference of our results from the previous works is that the large subsonic regions are formed in our simulations due to the nearly static regions above the surfaces .",
    "therefore , most of the input wave energies are deposited in the subsonic regions , which results in the slow winds , although the dissipation is not much faster than in the previous model calculations .",
    "we speculate that our dynamical wind solutions correspond to `` inner solutions '' introduced by @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that there are two transonic solutions in some cases ; one is the inner solution in which the wind is accelerated very gradually and the wind speed is slower , although they mainly studied the other one , the outer solution , in which the acceleration starts just above the surface .",
    "our dynamical simulations automatically select stable transonic wind solutions .",
    "then , our results might show that the inner solution is the stable branch of wave - driven winds .",
    "we would like to remark on an issue of time - dependent winds .",
    "our simulations show that some portions of the rgb atmospheres transiently accrete ( @xmath355 ) , which lasts longer than the assumed longest wave periods ( _ e.g. _ see the dashed line in the top panel of figure [ fig : mpw ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon may be an example of the hysterisis transition between subsonic accretion and supersonic wind discovered by @xcite .",
    "here we discuss processes and effects which need to be studied in more detailed calculations .",
    "we do not input longitudinal fluctuations at the photospheres , which would directly drive sound waves , because they do not contribute to the heating and acceleration of the stellar winds ( _ e.g. _ judge & carpenter 1998 ) ( in our simulations sound waves are generated from waves in the upper regions ;  [ sec : dwv ] ) .",
    "however , the sound waves directly from the surface might be important in the heating of low chromosphere ( e.g. carlsson & stein 1997 ) .",
    "we switch off the radiative cooling in the inner regions if @xmath356 k and @xmath357 g @xmath79 by the technical reason (  [ sec : siml ] ) . by taking into account the longitudinal perturbations at the photospheres",
    ", we may carry out a more self - consistent treatment of the low chromospheres without switching off the radiative cooling artificially .",
    "in our simulations we only consider the wave generation at the photospheres in the 1d flux tubes .",
    "however , interactions between flux tubes may be important in generation of waves , though 2d or 3d modeling is required to study such processes .",
    "for example , reconnection events between closed loops could be sources of small flare - like events , and these events probably excite compressive waves at locations above the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the magnetic reconnection between a closed loop and an open field line also possibly excites waves traveling upwardly @xcite .",
    "these waves would also play a role in the acceleration of red giant winds .",
    "further detailed analysis is necessary to estimate how such waves produced by activities involving closed loops are important with respect to the energetics .",
    "we treat the propagation of waves in the 1d flux tubes . in other words ,",
    "waves are assumed to travel in the same way in neighboring flux tubes .",
    "however , if speeds are slightly different in neighboring field lines , the waves become out of phase even if they are generated in the same way at the surface .",
    "then , these waves dissipate by phase mixing through resistivity and viscosity @xcite .    waves in stellar winds become more or less turbulent - like . then , turbulence cascades to higher frequency in the transverse direction with respect to underlying magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "therefore , waves might dissipate by different channels in more realistic 3d calculations , while in our 1d simulations the waves dissipate mainly through the decay instability (  [ sec : dwv ] ) .",
    "we assume the mhd approximation , namely a mean free path with respect to coulomb collisions , @xmath358 is smaller than a typical scale . here",
    ", we can take the minimum wavelength , @xmath359 , of the waves as a typical scale , hence , @xmath360 is the requirement for the mhd condition .",
    "otherwise we have to consider collisionless effects of plasma .",
    "this condition breaks in @xmath361 of the ms star ( model i ) and in @xmath362 of the sub - giant star ( model ii ) , while in the rgb stars ( models iii - vi ) it holds in the entire simulation regions because the densities are high and the temperatures are low .    in the collisionless regime ,",
    "compressive ( slow / fast mhd ) waves suffer collisionless damping @xcite .",
    "then , the dissipation rate of the slow mhd waves , which are nonlinearly generated from the waves , may be changed .",
    "this might further modify the mode conversion rate from the waves .",
    "then , the dissipation of the waves might be indirectly affected in models i and ii .      in the rgb atmospheres ,",
    "the temperatures sometimes become @xmath363 k as shown in the snap - shot results ( figures [ fig : mpw ] & [ fig : tdpd1 m ] ) .",
    "although even in such low temperatures a fraction of the gas is expected to be ionized by the uv / x - ray emissions from hot bubbles , a sizable amount of neutral atoms remain , or even molecules can also exist if @xmath364 k @xcite .",
    "the snap - shot results also show that the temperatures partly decreases further to @xmath365 k , and in such circumstances dusts are also formed .",
    "the existence of atoms and molecules indicate that the gas is not fully ionized but partially ionized .",
    "the mhd approximation implicitly assumes that the coupling between ions and neutrals is sufficient so that the gas can be treated as one fluid .",
    "otherwise , the friction between these two components plays a role in the dissipation of waves .",
    "we can check the condition of ion - neutral coupling by comparing wave frequency and a ion - neutral collision rate @xcite .",
    "we have found that the coupling is sufficient with respect to the low - frequency waves we are dealing with ; we do not have to worry about the effect of weakly ionized gas .",
    "however , if high frequency waves are generated by turbulent cascade , these waves dissipate by the ion - neutral damping more effectively than in fully - ionized gas @xcite .    molecules can be used as diagnostics to understand physical conditions of rgb star atmospheres .",
    "observations of co show that quasi - static cool ( @xmath366 k ) regions containing molecules are in the atmospheres of rgb stars , typically at @xmath367 @xcite .",
    "our simulations of the rgb stars also show the quasi - static regions in the atmospheres and the temperatures partly becomes low enough to form molecules .",
    "the cooling by molecules drive thermal instability at @xmath368 k @xcite , similarly to the ions in @xmath163 k. this will be important in controlling thermal properties of the atmospheres and winds of rgb stars .    radiation pressure on dusts is not efficient in driving winds of rgb stars @xcite , although it could be important in asymptotic giant branch stars . however , waves may dissipate by the cyclotron resonance with charged dusts @xcite , which might also give a correction to the dissipation of the waves . to study this effect",
    ", we have to carefully consider the formation processes of dusts in intermittently existing cool ( @xmath369 k ) gas .",
    "we have studied the winds of the intermediate and low mass rgb stars near the dl , by comparing with the coronal winds from the ms and sb stars .",
    "these stars all have the surface convective layers , which play a major role in driving the stellar winds as well as the uv / x - ray activities because other mechanisms such as centrifugal force and radiation pressure are insufficient .",
    "the surface turbulences excite various types of waves , among which the wave travels a longer distance and contribute to not only the atmospheric heating near the surface but the wind acceleration in @xmath34 several @xmath15 .",
    "we have , for the first time , successfully carried out the time - dependent mhd simulations of the red giant winds in the open magnetic field regions from the photospheres to the sufficiently distant locations ( @xmath370 ) .",
    "we inject the fluctuations from the photospheres , of which the amplitudes and spectra are estimated from the properties of the surface convection .",
    "we have determined the velocities , densities , and temperatures of the stellar winds in a self - consistent manner by taking into account the radiative cooling and thermal conduction ; the propagation and dissipation of the mhd waves are automatically treated , and the subsequent heating and acceleration of the gas are also self - consistently handled by the jump conditions of the mhd shocks , using the nonlinear mhd godunov - mocct algorithm .",
    "the stellar winds are driven by the nonlinear dissipation of the waves through the conversion to compressive waves , whereas other dissipation processes might become important when performing 3d modeling / simulations .",
    "the energy fraction that is transferred to the stellar wind against the initial wave energy is quite small , @xmath259 1% , and the rest of the energy is lost by the wave reflection ( less evolved stars ) and radiation ( more evolved stars ) .",
    "however , this tiny fraction is enough to explain the observed stellar winds from ms and rgb stars .",
    "when the stars evolve to slightly blueward positions of the dl , the steady hot coronae with temperature , @xmath156 k , disappear . in the atmospheres and winds of the rgb stars magnetized hot bubbles and cool chromospheric gas co -",
    "the hot bubbles are created in fast mhd shocks and supported by the magnetic pressure .",
    "therefore , the densities of the bubbles can be kept low .",
    "the radiative cooling is reduced to balance with the heating so that the bubbles survive much longer than the cooling timescale .",
    "the red giant winds are structured with many bubbles and blobs , and the mass loss rate and wind speed show large time - variations .",
    "the hot bubbles possibly become sources of euv and soft x - ray emissions of hybrid stars , whereas the cool chromospheric wind might absorb the emissions .",
    "the temperatures of the hot bubbles become lower in more evolved and less massive stars , which is consistent with the trends inferred from the observations of hybrid stars .",
    "the wind velocities also drop to 10 - 100 km s@xmath8 in the rgb stars , which are much slower than the escape speeds at the stellar surfaces .",
    "this is mainly because the static atmospheres are formed above the photospheres and the stellar winds are practically accelerated from several stellar radii .",
    "the terminal velocities are regulated by the escape speeds there , and the slower winds can escape .",
    "we have finally derived a relation ( equation [ eq : mswv ] ) that determines the mass loss rates of ms to rgb stars from the energetics of the simulated wave - drive winds .",
    "this has a different dependence on the stellar parameters from the well known reimers formula which mainly focuses on more evolved giants .",
