    "by various methods , new parameters can be introduced to expand families of probability distributions .",
    "this is an important issue in survival analysis @xcite . for instance , although the weibull distribution is often described as flexible , its hazard function is restricted to being monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing , or constant .",
    "typically , in survival analysis , the limitations of standard distributions led naturally to interest in developing extended distributions by adding further parameters to a given distribution .    the approach of @xcite works as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 denotes the survival function of a random variable , the corresponding marshall - olkin extended distribution has survival function , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an added scalar parameter .",
    "these distributions have been used in many areas :    * climatology : @xcite ; * hydrology : @xcite ; * insurance and finance : @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; * medicine : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; * engineering : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ...    for a review on the use of the extended marshall and olkin distributions , one can see @xcite .",

    "this property has been used notably by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to introduce covariates .",
    "+ some authors have investigated the behavior of the marshall and olkin extended distributions when the baseline distributions are lomax , @xcite , burr , and pareto , @xcite , @xmath3-weibull , @xcite and normal @xcite distributions . moreover , using the marshall and olkin approach , @xcite introduced a generalization of the discrete geometric distribution .",
    "+ in the baseline exponential case , @xcite highlighted the link between the truncated logistic distribution and the marshall and olkin extended one .",
