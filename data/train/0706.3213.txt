    "* ) , favorable galactic latitude ( b  =  @xmath360@xmath2 ) , and low foreground reddening ( e(b@xmath3v)=  0.025 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) make it an ideal target for stellar population and interstellar medium ( ism ) studies .",
    "this is evidenced by the impressive number of previous studies of this galaxy , summarized by @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the neutral hydrogen in ic  1613 .",
    "they found the galaxy to be gas rich with the  distribution being lumpy in the inner galaxy and smoother at larger radii . @xcite and",
    "@xcite performed deep photometry of single hst / wfpc2 fields in the inner and outer galaxy , respectively . both of these studies used high - precision photometry to derive star formation histories .",
    "they found continuous star formation over the past few hundred myr , as well as populations of intermediate age and ancient stars .    ic  1613 is , in most respects , a typical irregular galaxy .",
    "its metal abundance , current star formation rate , and dust content are all normal for a galaxy of its luminosity .",
    "the morphology consists of a prominent star forming region northeast of the galaxy center and a bar running linearly through the galaxy center from southeast to northwest .",
    "perhaps the only exceptional property of ic  1613 is its nearly complete absence of star clusters @xcite , which may be evidence of its isolated evolution @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present part ii of our  irac thermal infrared study of the stellar populations in local group dwarf irregulars with a census of the asymptotic giant branch stars in ic  1613 . in  [ observations ] we describe the observations , data reduction , and photometry . in  [ morphology ]",
    "we present the  irac images and describe the near- and mid - ir morphology of ic  1613 .",
    "we characterize the infrared color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) in  [ photometry ] . in  [ agb ] we detail a complete census of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , a comparison with broadband optical photometry (  [ complete ] ) , a comparison with an optical carbon star study (  [ carbon ] ) , the determination of mass - loss rates ( mlrs ;  [ mass_loss ] ) , and the total luminosity contribution from the agb population (  [ luminosity ] ) . in  [ conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "images of ic  1613 were obtained with the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ? * ) on board the  _ space telescope _ @xcite in two separate aors on 2003 december 21 ut and 2005 december 23 ut ( aorkeys : r5051648 and r15892736 ) , respectively .",
    "both aors are part of a larger guaranteed time observing program ( pid : 128 , pi : r.d .",
    "five individual 200 s frames at 4.5 and 8.0 and 32 individual 30 s frames at 3.6 and 5.8  were used resulting in total integration times of 1000 s per pointing at 4.5 and 8.0  and 960 s per pointing at 3.6 and 5.8 .",
    "these data yielded 5-@xmath4 point source sensitivities of 4.5 , 3.5 , 10.7 , and 16.5 @xmath5jy at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 , respectively . because the irac 3.6 and 5.8  field of view is offset from that at 4.5 and 8.0 , a 3@xmath02 mosaic in array coordinates approximately 15@xmath6@xmath010@xmath6 for each channel was created to map ic  1613 .",
    "this resulted in a coverage area with data in all four irac channels of approximately 9@xmath79@xmath6 in size , centered at @xmath8(2000)=02:06:30 , @xmath9(2000)=01:04:50 .",
    "figure [ coverage ] shows this field of view overlaid on the digitized sky survey image of ic  1613 .",
    "irac data ( pipeline version 13.2.0 ) were reduced with the mopex reduction package , version 2006 march 1 .",
    "the backgrounds of individual frames were matched using the overlap routine .",
    "the mosaic program was used for outlier detection , image interpolation and co - addition , and to create the final mosaics .",
    "very bright objects imaged in the program immediately preceding our observations resulted in persistent images in the 8.0  data taken in 2003 . these artifacts were effectively removed by subtracting a median - combined image of all of the dithered frames from each individual frame .",
    "point source photometry was done using the daophot ii photometry package @xcite .",
    "a sharpness clip was applied to the photometry in each of the irac bands .",
    "this clip removes any objects from the photometry list whose radial profiles are significantly steeper or broader than the profile of the derived point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we adopt the standard daophot errors as the total photometric errors for our sources .",
    "the irac instrument also has an estimated absolute calibration accuracy of 3% @xcite , although we do not include this uncertainty in our photometric errors .",
    "optical _ v _ and _ i _ photometry of ic  1613 were obtained from the ogle - ii microlensing survey @xcite .",
    "these data are used to aid in identifying the stellar type of the stars detected in our irac data , which is challenging with irac data alone ( see  [ photometry ] ) .",
    "the optical data were acquired in the context of detecting objects that are variable ( due to either microlensing events or intrinsic stellar variability ) by taking a large number of frames , each with relatively short integration times .",
    "the photometry presented here is the mean of the individual photometric observations , including those objects found to be variable .",
    "the field of view of the @xcite optical data covers the entire irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  coverage area , except for a small triangular region @xmath100.9 square arcmin in size in the south - eastern edge of the irac coverage area ( see figure [ coverage ] ) .      to estimate the number of foreground stars in both the optical and ir data we used the milky way stellar population synthesis model of @xcite .",
    "sources were modeled for the galactic coordinates of ic  1613 in a one square degree field to reduce statistical error .",
    "the @xcite model provides magnitudes in the johnson - cousins l - band , whose central wavelength is close to that of the irac 3.6 band . in the region of ic  1613 where we have coverage in the optical and all four irac channels , we expect 15 foreground stars in our ir color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "these 15 foreground stars are expected to have @xmath37.5@xmath11m@xmath1216 and [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ] colors near zero .",
    "irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  images of ic  1613 are shown in figure [ irac ] .",
    "in general , the stars in these images are uniformly distributed throughout the images , consistent with the regular elliptical distribution of red giants discussed by @xcite , and dubbed baade s population ii ` sheet ' by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the smooth distribution of stars , a concentration of bright stars is seen in the large star forming complex in the northeast .",
    "the only diffuse emission detected in these images is 8.0  emission from hot ( @xmath10350 k ) dust and/or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .",
    "this emission is detected in regions roughly coincident with strong h@xmath8 emission ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the optical color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) from the @xcite data is shown in figure [ optical_cmd ] , segregated into regions consisting of ( a ) blue objects that can include massive main sequence stars and unresolved  regions , ( b ) asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , ( c ) red supergiants ( rsgs ) , and ( d ) red giants ( rgs ) below the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) .",
    "we refer hereafter to the stars called out in ( d ) as sub - trgb stars .",
    "these regions are used to identify the stellar populations in the infrared cmd , since irac data alone provide little information on stellar effective temperatures .",
    "these indicated regions are separated by gaps reflecting the estimated 1-@xmath4 photometric error , which were employed to minimize misidentification of stellar types solely due to photometric errors .",
    "reddening from circumstellar and interstellar material can also cause such misidentification .",
    "the optical cmd shows features of both recent and very old star formation , consistent with the finding of @xcite that ic  1613 has a relatively constant star formation rate over the age of the universe .",
    "figure [ ir_cmd ] shows the 3.6  absolute magnitude versus [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ]  cmd .",
    "the left panel shows all of the stars detected at both 3.6 and 4.5 , with photometric errors , averaged over one magnitude bins , displayed .",
    "the left panel also shows the 50% completeness limit ( black line ) derived from artificial star tests . the right panel shows the stars detected in _ v _",
    ", _ i _ , and at 3.6 and 4.5 , with rsgs shown as black stars , agb stars as green triangles , red giants as red squares , and blue objects as blue circles .",
    "the right panel contains a vector showing the displacement a star would experience due to 10 visual magnitudes of extinction and reddening @xcite , though this vector does not include the effects of dust emission , which can be significant in the mid - ir .",
    "the right panel also shows the agb limit , which was determined by taking the @xcite models for carbon - rich agb stars with t@xmath13  =  2650 and t@xmath13  =  3600 and negligible mass - loss and scaling them to an absolute bolometric magnitude of m@xmath14  =  @xmath37.1 . the agb limit depicted in this figure is a line connecting these two models .",
    "agb stars that are losing significant mass can be brighter than this limit due to thermal emission of the mass - loss material increasing their 3.6  flux ( as shown in detail in ",
    "[ mass_loss ] ) , however , any such objects would also have red [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ] colors .",
    "none of these objects are observed , thus , we conclude all of the stars brighter than the agb limit are true red supergiants .",
    "the right panel also shows the 3.6  trgb .",
    "the value of the trgb we adopt ( m@xmath15=@xmath36.2@xmath160.2 ) was determined by inspecting the 3.6  luminosity function for sources detected at both 3.6 and 4.5 .",
    "the 3.6  luminosity function ( the number of stars in each 0.2 magnitude bin at 3.6 ) is shown in figure [ lum_fn ] .",
    "we adopt this value of the trgb based on the abrupt drop in detections at that magnitude . also , optically classified sub - trgb red giants with blue [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ] colors are observed with m@xmath15 magnitudes up to this value , but above this value only optically classified sub - trgb red giants with very red colors are observed .",
    "the ir fluxes of these objects are consistent with mass - losing agbs ( see  [ agb ] ) rather than sub - trgb red giants , supporting our adopted value of m@xmath15=@xmath36.2 for the 3.6  trgb .",
    "this value is 0.2 magnitudes fainter than the value found for the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ( m@xmath17=@xmath36.4 ; * ? ? ? * ) and 0.4 magnitudes lower than that adopted for wlm @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that the difference in values of the trgb between ic  1613 and wlm are actually so disparate , given their similar metallicities .",
    "the difference in these values likely reflects the uncertainty in our adopted trgb values .",
    "this uncertainty is not a major concern , however , because shifting the value of the trgb by up to 0.5 magnitudes affects the detection statistics only slightly ( see  [ complete ] ) .    in general ,",
    "the m@xmath15 versus [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ] cmd of ic  1613 is very similar to that of wlm , with the only major difference being that there are significantly more sub - trgb red giants detected in ic  1613 than in wlm because wlm is more distant . as is the case of wlm , a small population of stars redward of the main stellar distribution is detected , though fewer are seen in ic  1613 than in wlm . as we discuss in ",
    "[ mass_loss ] , the infrared fluxes and colors of these objects are consistent with mass - losing agb stars .",
    "figure [ ch4cmd ] is the m@xmath18 versus [ 3.6]@xmath3[8.0 ] cmd for ic  1613 .",
    "this cmd shows a narrow vertical feature with [ 3.6]@xmath3[8.0]@xmath100 and another broad distribution of red objects with @xmath312  @xmath11  m@xmath18  @xmath11  @xmath37.5 1  @xmath11  [ 3.6]@xmath3[8.0 ]  @xmath11  4 .",
    "these red objects are also the most luminous , reddest objects in the m@xmath15 versus [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ] cmd , with typical colors between 0.5 and 1.0 .",
    "figure [ xy ] shows the spatial distributions of different stellar types based on their optical and ir fluxes .",
    "the distributions of both red giants and agb stars are very smooth with no obvious concentrations aside from the radial stellar gradient .",
    "a thin gap is observed in the optical data , which is certainly an instrumental effect , though this is not mentioned in @xcite .",
    "there are two conspicuous features in the blue objects , which outline the young stellar distribution ; a bar running across the midplane of the galaxy and a large clump in the northeast , which highlights the most active star forming complex in ic  1613 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that neither the optical nor the ir data presented here reach the outermost regions of the stellar population , as the stellar density is still dropping off at the edges of the images . in the analogous plot in @xcite ,",
    "the effects of crowding could clearly be seen in wlm as clumps of bright , young stars coincided spatially with an absence of fainter red giants . in ic  1613",
    "we see no evidence for such an effect , likely because ic  1613 is seen much more face on ( _ i _  =  38@xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than wlm ( _ i",
    "_  =  69@xmath2 , * ? ? ? * ) .    in table",
    "[ stats ] we present the detection statistics for the optical and infrared photometry of ic  1613 .",
    "we detect 5211 , 3162 , 886 , and 618 point sources at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 , respectively , and the @xcite _ v _ and _ i _ data contain 7266 point sources within the optical and ir coverage region .",
    "we detect 183 point sources in all four irac channels with no corresponding detection in the optical .",
    "three of these are rsgs ( i.e. , they are above the agb limit ) , two of these are very red objects below the trgb , and the remaining 178 are either rsgs , agb stars , or blue objects .",
    "as shown in figure [ ir_cmd ] , our completeness limit is more than 0.5 mag fainter than the trgb for the bluest objects and 1.5 mag fainter than the trgb for red objects .",
    "consequently , our data constitutes a complete census of the super - trgb agb stars with the exception of a very small number of objects not detected due to crowding .    as described in @xcite ,",
    "though our data should represent a complete census of the agb stars , we can not distinguish between agb stars , rsgs , and blue objects using irac data alone .",
    "however , above the trgb , optically identified rsgs and blue objects comprise only 9% ( 95 out of 1041 ) of the objects between the trgb and the agb limit .",
    "therefore , we assume any object between the trgb and the agb limit is an agb star unless its optical identification dictates otherwise , with the understanding that there may be a small amount of contamination by other stellar types .",
    "altogether we detect 1052 agb stars in our irac data . of these",
    "57% are detected in the @xcite _ v _ and _ i _ data .",
    "in addition to the 43% of agb stars detected in the ir but not seen in the optical , 11% of the ir detected agb stars are located in the optical cmd where they would be misidentified as sub - trgb red giants .",
    "for comparison , in wlm @xcite found 39% of the ir detected agb stars were not seen in the optical data of @xcite , and an additional 4% were optically detected , but misidentified as sub - trgb red giants . an important check of our agb statistics for wlm was recently provided by @xcite , who performed j and k@xmath19 near - ir photometry .",
    "altogether they detect 355 agb stars ( carbon  +  m - type agbs ) , in comparison with the 331 agb stars we detect in the same field of view .",
    "it is not surprising that the number of agbs we detect in wlm and ic  1613 are in such close agreement given the striking similarities in the evolution , and particularly in the intermediate age star formation histories , of these galaxies ( figures 25 and 35 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figure [ frac ]",
    "we show the fraction of optical completeness as a function of [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ] color ( left panel ) and as a function of the modeled agb wind optical depth ( right panel ; agb mass - loss modeling is described in detail in  [ mass_loss ] ) .",
    "this figure shows the optical completeness fraction is a smoothly declining function of [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ] color , as is expected if the incompleteness is due to extinction by circumstellar material . much like in the case of wlm",
    ", we see the completeness fraction fall to 0% at a [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ] color of @xmath100.9 .",
    "it is important to understand to what degree our adopted value of the trgb affects these completeness statistics . by shifting our adopted value 0.5 mag fainter the fraction of optically undetected agb stars changes by only 2% , while shifting the trgb 0.5 mag brighter would increase the optically undetected agb fraction by 10% . as in the case of wlm ,",
    "this increase in optical incompleteness with increasing luminosity supports our conclusion that the optically undetected agb stars are not seen because they are enshrouded by circumstellar material , since the mass - loss phase in agb stars occurs somewhat above the trgb and should consequently be more conspicuous at higher luminosities .",
    "narrowband and broadband optical photometry of ic  1613 using the cn / tio technique was performed by @xcite . in comparison with our irac photometry ,",
    "the @xcite data detected 50% of the total agb population seen in our irac data .",
    "this value is slightly lower than the fraction detected by @xcite and is caused by the brighter completeness limits of the narrowband data , since the broadband data from @xcite is significantly more sensitive than that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite distinguish between oxygen- and carbon - rich agbs using a color - color diagram .",
    "at relatively red _",
    "( r - i ) _ colors oxygen- and carbon - rich agbs have easily distinguishable cn - tio colors , however , agbs with bluer _ ( r - i ) _ colors are not easily separated . consequently , a color limit is imposed , redward of which the discrimination of chemical composition can be made . within",
    "our irac coverage area @xcite identified 74 carbon stars . assuming their c / m ratio of 0.64 , this yields 190 total agb stars ( c  +  m - type ) .",
    "thus , after applying their imposed color limit , 18% of the total agb population was considered for the c / m ratio .",
    "figure [ carbon_cmd ] shows our irac photometry of the carbon stars identified by @xcite .",
    "the carbon stars have relatively blue colors , probably due to the low - metallicity , and consequently the low optical depth of circumstellar wind material of agbs in ic  1613 , though four red carbon stars are seen that are likely losing significant mass .",
    "there are also three carbon stars identified by @xcite that we find to be well below the trgb at 3.6 .",
    "these three stars are also below the trgb in the optical , and are possibly extrinsic carbon stars . because it is very unlikely that these three objects are in fact true carbon - rich agb stars we do not consider them in any of the carbon star statistics . with the exception of these three objects , the carbon stars identified by @xcite have relatively bright 3.6  luminosities compared to the rest of the agb stars .",
    "the comparison between our ir photometry and the narrowband optical data in ic  1613 is nearly identical to the values we found for this same comparison in wlm @xcite . in wlm",
    "we found the completeness fraction of the @xcite optical narrowband data was 63% of the total agb population observed in our irac data and the c / m ratio was based on 18% of the irac detected agb stars .",
    "like in the comparison of broadband optical completeness , the striking similarity between agb populations in ic  1613 and wlm is likely due to their similar star formation histories and metallicity evolution .",
    "in @xcite we stated that the @xcite optical cn / tio study of wlm _ detected _ only 18% of the total agb population , which is misleading .",
    "again , because of the necessity to impose a color limit to discriminate between carbon- and oxygen - rich agbs , relatively blue agb stars are ignored in the calculation of the c / m ratio . in wlm 18% of the total agb population",
    "was used to calculate the c / m ratio , while an additional 45% of the total population was detected but not used in the c / m ratio because the chemical composition could not be determined .",
    "this point is critical to consider when comparing c / m ratios obtained using different methods . as an example",
    ", recent near - ir photometry of wlm @xcite found a c / m ratio of 0.58 ( corrected for foreground contamination ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the @xcite value of 12.4 , though these values must not be directly compared because , as is shown here , the @xcite c / m ratio was calculated using 18% of the agb stars , while the @xcite value considered the entire agb population .",
    "the mass - loss rates ( mlrs ) of agb stars in ic  1613 were determined by comparing their infrared fluxes with the radiative transfer models of @xcite .",
    "the [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ] color of agb stars corresponds to a unique wind optical depth ( @xmath20 ) , given assumptions about the wind composition and stellar effective temperature ( t@xmath13 ) , as we discuss below .",
    "the [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ] colors were linearly interpolated onto the @xcite models to estimate @xmath20 , then scaled according to the @xcite mlr prescription , where : @xmath21  @xmath22  @xmath20@xmath23l@xmath24 , @xmath25 is the dust - to - gas ratio , and l is the stellar luminosity . for ic  1613",
    "we adopt the nebular oxygen abundance of 12+log(o / h )  =  7.62 @xcite , which corresponds to a metallicity of 0.9% z@xmath26 .",
    "given that the dust - to - gas ratio scales as @xmath25  =  @xmath25@xmath2610@xmath27}$ ] and @xmath25@xmath26  =  0.005 @xcite , we adopt @xmath25@xmath28  =  4.8@xmath010@xmath29 .",
    "it is more appropriate to apply the metallicity of ic  1613 as it was a few gyr ago when the current agb population was forming , rather than the current metallicity .",
    "however , determining this value empirically is difficult , and @xcite find very little metallicity evolution in ic  1613 over the past few gyr , so applying the current metallicity to the agb stars should be reasonably accurate .",
    "there are two major uncertainties in deriving mlrs for agb stars using only our 3.6 and 4.5 micron data .",
    "the first is that there is a degeneracy between @xmath20 and t@xmath13 , such that cool agb stars losing no mass can have the same [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ] color as warmer agbs that are losing mass . because of this degeneracy",
    "we are forced to derive mlrs by adopting a single t@xmath13 for all of the agb stars , which is certainly not physical . as a consequence , the mlrs we find for individual blue agb stars ( i.e. , agb stars with [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ]",
    "@xmath11  0.5 ) should not be over - interpreted .",
    "@xcite showed that atmospheric molecular absorption features can also effect the irac colors of agb stars , introducing additional uncertainty to these measurements , although these effects have not yet been quantified .",
    "however , as emphasized in @xcite , because the majority of the integrated mass - loss for ic  1613 comes from sources much redder than [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ]  @xmath30  0.5 , where the mlr we calculate is much less sensitive to t@xmath13 , the integrated mlr for the galaxy as well as those found for red agb stars are robust .",
    "the second major uncertainty in our mlr calculation is that we have no _ a priori _ information about the chemical composition of the agb winds , and therefore , must assume a single chemical composition for the entire agb population .",
    "this assumption is also unphysical , and the disparity between the integrated mlrs we measure for all of the modeled wind compositions and effective temperatures differ by a factor of four .",
    "figure [ mbol ] shows the mlr versus bolometric luminosity for each agb and rsg in ic  1613 assuming a wind composition of 85% amorphos carbon ( amc ) + 15% sic and effective temperatures of t@xmath13  =  2650 k ( _ filled _ circles ) and t@xmath13  =  3600 k ( _ open _ circles ) .",
    "again , we consider any object detected at 3.6 and 4.5  that is above the trgb at 3.6  to be an agb star , except for those optically classified as blue objects , since unresolved  regions lie in the same part of the ir cmd as mass - losing agbs . in comparison with the tracks of increasing wind optical depth ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this plot shows that the most heavily mass - losing stars are among the most luminous agbs .",
    "the maximum mlrs observed in ic  1613 are in very good agreement with the maximum mlrs seen in wlm @xcite and the lmc @xcite , and somewhat higher than the classic single - scattering mlr limit predicted by @xcite .",
    "we also see a number of rsgs above the agb limit , none of which show infrared excess .    the total mlrs we derive for ic  1613 are 2.4@xmath010@xmath29  for t@xmath13  =  2650 k and 85% amc + 15% sic , 4.3@xmath010@xmath29 for t@xmath13  =  3600 k and 85% amc + 15% sic , 1.0@xmath010@xmath1  for t@xmath13  =  2500 k and 60% silicate + 40% aluminum oxide , and 8.8@xmath010@xmath29 for t@xmath13  =  2500 and 100% silicate .",
    "these values are approximately a factor of two lower than those found for wlm .",
    "considering that a significant fraction of the mass - loss is coming from a small number of objects with short mass - loss timescales , the integrated mlr of a relatively low - mass dwarf like ic  1613 could be highly time - variable and the consistency between the mlrs of wlm and ic  1613 is notable .",
    "for point sources detected at 3.6 and 4.5  we find a total 3.6  flux of 72.4 mjy .",
    "85% of this total flux is from agb stars and rsgs , which is very similar to the case of wlm , where we found 79% of the flux in point sources was from sources brighter than the trgb . the total flux in point sources we measure for ic  1613 constitutes 79% of the integrated 4.5  flux detected by @xcite .",
    "following @xcite and adopting an age of the current super - trgb stellar population of 2 gyr we find a total stellar mass of 1.7@xmath010@xmath31 .",
    "this value is a factor of 2.6 higher than the 6.6@xmath010@xmath32  estimated by @xcite .",
    "because the @xcite method of measuring stellar mass assumes a single - aged stellar population and is dependent on the age of that population , our stellar mass may be over - estimated since a number of stars above the trgb in ic  1613 are likely rsgs younger than 2 gyr old .",

    "thermal near - ir photometry of ic  1613 .",
    "these data are compared with the optical _ v _ and _ i _ photometry of @xcite and we find that 43% of the ir detected agb stars are not detected in the optical and an additional 11% of the agbs are misidentified as sub - trgb red giants .",
    "we show that the optical incompleteness fraction is very well correlated with the [ 3.6]@xmath3[4.5 ] color , which indicates that the optically undetected agb stars have been reddened by circumstellar material beyond the optical completeness limits .",
    "our ir photometry is also compared with the narrowband optical carbon star study of @xcite and we find their study detects 50% of the total agb population , and their calculated c / m ratio is based on 18% of this population .",
    "further , the number of ir detected agb stars we find for wlm in @xcite is in excellent agreement with the recent near - ir study of @xcite , who find a c / m ratio of 0.58 .",
    "we find the total mlrs from agb stars to be 0.2 - 1.0@xmath010@xmath1 , depending on the assumed effective temperatures and chemical composition of the mass - loss winds of the agb stars .",
    "the distribution of bolometric luminosities and mlrs of individual agb stars is in excellent agreement with those observed in the magellanic clouds @xcite .      finally , the properties of the agb populations in ic  1613 ( i.e. , the broadband and narrowband optical completeness fractions and mlrs ) are nearly identical to those found in @xcite for wlm",
    "this is no doubt due to their similar galaxy characteristics and evolutionary histories , and is likely representative of star - forming dis .",
    "we sincerely thank serge demers for providing his narrowband photometry of wlm and ic  1613 and for extremely valuable comments regarding narrowband optical completeness statistics .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for their careful reading of the manuscript and their valuable comments , particularly regarding the possible detection of extrinsic carbon stars .",
