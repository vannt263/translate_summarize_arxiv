    "understanding the star formation activity and history of local dwarf galaxies is of high astrophysical relevance .",
    "in fact , they represent ideal laboratories to study how star formation occurs in low - metallicity environments that , at the same time , do not show any global , ordered kinematic structure as in disk galaxies . as such",
    ", dwarf galaxies allow us to study how stellar feedback alone affects the physics , kinematics and chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium .",
    "nearby , star - forming dwarf galaxies that are metal - poor and gas - rich are often compared to the first galaxies in the early universe ( see izotov & thuan 1999 ) , which were the first structures to collapse from primordial density fluctuations , and gave rise to larger systems through mergers ( white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et al .",
    "they are also referred to as the possible local counterparts of starbursting galaxies that , at moderate redshift , dominate the faint galaxy counts at blue wavelengths ( broadhurst , ellis & glazebrook 1992 ; lilly et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the nearby galaxy ngc  1569 is considered to be the archetype starbust dwarf galaxy for several reasons .",
    "first of all , it is gas - rich and relatively metal - poor : at the revised distance of 3.36 mpc ( grocholski et al .",
    "2008 , so that m@xmath12 = -18 ) , its hi and dynamical masses are @xmath132 @xmath6 10@xmath14 m@xmath8 and 5.1 @xmath6 10@xmath14 m@xmath8 , respectively ( adapted from reakes 1980 ) .",
    "its gas - phase and stellar metallicities are estimated to be 12 @xmath15 log(o / h ) @xmath5 8.3 ( calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann 1994 ; gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "1997 , kobulnicky & skillman 1997 ) and @xmath16 0.1 - 0.2 @xmath17 ( grocholski et al . 2008",
    "; aloisi et al .",
    "2001 ) , respectively .",
    "star formation has taken place in ngc  1569 for a hubble time , although with different intensities as obtained by vallenari & bomans ( 1996 ) , greggio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , aloisi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and angeretti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) using color - magnitude diagrams of resolved stars .",
    "the recent studies by angeretti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and grocholski et al .",
    "( 2008 ) show that the star formation activity of ngc  1569 started about 10 gyr ago and proceeded until @xmath131 gyr ago presumably at a constant , very low rate . in the last 1 gyr , however , ngc  1569 experienced at least three major bursts of star formation : _",
    "i ) _ the older one started about 1 gyr ago and ended @xmath13100 myr ago with an average star formation rate ( @xmath18sfr@xmath19 ) of about 0.04 m@xmath8  yr@xmath9 ; _ ii ) _ the intermediate episode was triggered about @xmath13 100 myr ago and lasted up to 30 myr ago with @xmath18sfr@xmath19 @xmath13 0.08 m@xmath8  yr@xmath9 , and _",
    "iii ) _ the younger burst begun @xmath13 27 myr ago and ended about 8 myr ago with @xmath18sfr@xmath19 @xmath13 0.3 m@xmath8  yr@xmath9 ( angeretti et al .",
    "according to aloisi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the spatial distribution of stars across the galaxy changes with their age , so that stars younger than 50 myr are more centrally concentrated , intermediate age stars ( 50 myr - 1 gyr ) are uniformly distributed , and older stars are mostly found in the outskirts of ngc  1569 .",
    "angeretti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested that this episodic star formation ( in the last 1 gyr ) could be ascribed to the gravitational interactions of ngc  1569 with an hi cloud ( @xmath13 7 @xmath6 10@xmath11 m@xmath8 in mass ) a few kpc away yet connected to the galaxy by an hi bridge ( cf . stil & israel 1998 ) .",
    "the presence of several hii regions ( waller 1991 ) and the spatially extended h@xmath3 emission indicate that ngc  1569 has formed new stars rather recently .",
    "hunter & elmegreen ( 2004 ) used the spatially integrated h@xmath3 luminosity ( corrected for reddening ) to derive a sfr of @xmath13 0.6 m@xmath8  yr@xmath9 ( adjusted to a distance of 3.36 mpc ) .",
    "the morphology of the extended h@xmath3 is rather complex and characterized by arcs , filaments and four large - scale superbubbles ( hunter et al . 1993 ; heckman et al .",
    "1995 ; martin 1998 ; westmoquette et al .",
    "the latter are seen to expand at typical velocities of @xmath13100 km  s@xmath9 which imply dynamical ages @xmath18 25 myr , consistent with the most recent burst of star formation derived by angeretti et al .",
    "( 2005 ; heckman et al . 1995 ; westmoquette , smith & gallagher 2008 ) .",
    "the expansion of these superbubbles is most likely powering a galactic outflow throughout the disk whose direction is approximately perpendicular to the inclined and flattened hi disc of ngc  1569 .",
    "the presence of an outflow of ionized gas is also supported by the high [ sii]/h@xmath3 ratios measured within the superbubbles and indicative of shocks ( westmoquette , smith & gallagher 2008 ) .",
    "the arcs of ionized gas detected in h@xmath3 and x - ray in the superbubbles suggest that the hot gas is still confined within the superbubbles , although it is moving at the escape velocity of ngc  1569 .",
    "thus , at present day , the galactic outflow of ngc  1569 does not appear to be in a steady state and to be able to induce mass loss from the galaxy ( westmoquette , smith & gallagher 2008 ) .",
    "ngc  1569 is special also for another reason : it hosts two of the nearest super - star clusters known ( sscs a and b , arp & sandage 1985 ) .",
    "sscs are massive star clusters few myr to several hundred myr old , believed to be the ancestors of globular clusters .",
    "in fact , they are as extended and massive as globular clusters and , after @xmath1310 gyr of passive evolution , they can match the luminosity range spanned by globular clusters today ( cf .",
    "van den bergh 1995 ; meurer 1995 ) .",
    "they are typically observed in interacting / merger systems ( see whitmore et al . 1993 ) and starburst galaxies ( see meurer et al .",
    "in ngc  1569 , ssc a has been resolved into two components ( a1 and a2 , de marchi et al .",
    "1997 ) , of which a2 may be the host of young o and wolf - rayet stars and a1 together with ssc b may be dominated by older red supergiants ( origlia et al .",
    "gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggested that sscs a and b have possibly undergone sequential star formation , with two major bursts of star formation about 3 and 9 myr ago .",
    "the authors also found a deficit of ionized gas around sscs a and b which may have been created by the stellar winds and supernova explosions of the older burst removing the local gas . according to the measurements of ho & filippenko ( 1996 ) ssc a is as massive as @xmath134 @xmath6 10@xmath20 m@xmath8 ( adjusted to a distance of 3.36 mpc ) .",
    "age dating of star clusters and resolved stars strongly depends on dust extinction .",
    "studies of the stellar content of ngc  1569 based on long - slit spectroscopy show that the intrisic dust extinction varies across ngc  1569 by few tenths of a dex , and peaks at sscs a and b ( gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "1997 ; origlia et al .",
    "2001 ) and in the north - west portion of the galaxy ( kobulnicky & skillman 1997 ) . the spatial coverage of long - slit spectroscopy is coarse , however , and no uniform and contiguous two - dimensional map of the dust extinction in ngc  1569 is available in the literature .",
    "clearly , such a 2d map helps in reaching a higher accuracy in the determination of the star formation history and its associated star formation rate across ngc  1569 .",
    "for this reason , we have taken advantage of the large field of view of lucifer ( lbt nir spectroscopic utility with camera and integral - field unit for extragalactic research ) mounted on the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) to perform deep imaging in the br@xmath1 filter and in the k band .",
    "our aim is to construct the 2d spatial map of dust extinction across ngc  1569 from the br@xmath1 and h@xmath3 ( obtained with the advanced camera for surveys on hst ) images of the galaxy and to derive the 2d spatial distribution of star formation rate density .",
    "we also observed the hei 1.08@xmath0 and [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0 lines and their broad - band continua in order to estimate the number of massive young stars and the supernova rate in ngc  1569 , respectively .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in sect .",
    "the spatial distribution of the color excess e@xmath4(b - v ) associated with the gas and the spatial distribution of the star formation rate density across ngc  1569 are derived in sect . 3 and 4 , respectively , while the properties of the [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0 m emission are analyzed in sect",
    "conclusions follow in sect .",
    "the observations presented here were carried out with the lbt , located on mount graham , arizona ( hill , green & slagle 2006 ) .",
    "ngc  1569 was observed during the science commissioning of lucifer ( ageorges et al .",
    "2010 ; seifert et al .",
    "2010 ) , with the n3.75 camera which provides a 4@xmath21 4@xmath22 field of view at an angular resolution of 0.12@xmath23/pixel ( equivalent to 1.95 pc per pixel at the adopted distance of 3.36 mpc ) .",
    "we imaged ngc  1569 between september and november 2009 in the jhk broad bands and in the narrow - band hei 1.08@xmath0 m , [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0 m and br@xmath1 filters , with a seeing @xmath24 0.5@xmath23 ( i.e. 8 pc ) throughout the observing runs .",
    "although the exposure times in the broad - band and br@xmath1 filters were estimated from the available 2mass photometry and @xmath2/acs f658n ( h@xmath3 ) image via the lucifer exposure time calculator , the effective exposure times were largely dictated by the available amount of time during the lucifer commissioning .",
    "the exposure time for each of the hei 1.08@xmath0 m and [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0 m filters was initially set to 1 hour ( following labrie & pritchet 2006 ) , but it was later cut down to 30 min for the hei 1.08@xmath0 m .",
    "the final exposure times on source achieved for the near - ir dataset are listed in table 1 , together with the imaging taken in the f606w ( broad v ) and f658n ( h@xmath3 ) filters with @xmath2/acs as part of program i d 10885 ( pi aloisi ) .",
    "the near - ir images were reduced with standard iraf routines .",
    "they were corrected for bias and flat - fielding , and their astrometric solution was derived from the field stars in common with 2mass .",
    "after background subtraction , the images taken in the same filter were corrected for geometric distortion and then combined together on the basis of their world coordinate system with a weighted mean .",
    "the final mosaiced frames in the broad band filters were flux - calibrated , at a 10% accuracy , using the 2mass magnitudes of the stars in the field of ngc  1569 .",
    "after convolution to the same psf ( fwhm = 0.5@xmath23 ) the continuum emission was subtracted from each narrow - band image by scaling the closest broad - band image ( j for hei 1.08@xmath0 m , h for [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0 m and k for br@xmath1 ) so that field stars would have had the same integrated count rate in both the narrow and broad band filters .",
    "this scaling was applied to the broad band zero points in order to calibrate the pure emission line images in flux , with an achieved accuracy of 20% ( estimated from the scatter in the zero point derived from different stars ) .",
    "the optical hst / acs images were retrieved from the hst archive already reduced .",
    "the subtraction of the continuum emission ( the f606w image ) from the f658n frame and the flux calibration of the pure h@xmath3 emission were performed as for the near - ir data , reaching a flux accuracy of 20% .",
    "such a low accuracy in the flux calibration of the h@xmath3 is mostly due to the broad f606w filter which makes it impossible to account for color terms .",
    "the h@xmath3-emission image was corrected for a 5% flux contribution from the [ nii ] @xmath256548,6584 lines ( moustakas & kennicutt 2006 ) , and then convolved with a gaussian function to have the same stellar psf as the br@xmath1-emission image , resampled to achieve the same pixel scale as the lucifer n3.75 camera , and aligned to the br@xmath1-emission image .",
    "most of the analysis presented in the following sections requires or involves the production of spatially resolved maps of flux ratios in different passbands . in order to ensure a sufficient s / n for the largest number of pixels",
    "while retaining the best possible spatial resolution , we adopt the approach introduced by zibetti , charlot & rix ( 2009 ) using the adaptive smoothing code adaptsmooth ( zibetti 2009 ) .",
    "we first smooth each image individually by taking the median flux among the pixels inside a top - hat circular kernel , whose size is determined as the minimum that allows to obtain a s / n@xmath26 ( background dominated noise is assumed ) . the spatial match between different bands",
    "is obtained by requiring that the kernel size at each pixel location ensures a minimum s / n of 10 in all images ( see zibetti 2009 for details ) .",
    "the smoothing procedure also results in a first s / n cut : all pixels for which sufficient s / n of 10 can not be reached in all images even when the maximum kernel size of 27 pixels is used are flagged .",
    "a further s / n cut is applied by excluding all pixels whose flux ( in the smoothed image ) is less than 3@xmath27 of the large scale background fluctuations as measured from randomly placed boxes of a few hundred pixels on a side .",
    "the line - emission images of ngc  1569 are shown in fig .",
    "1 , already flux - calibrated but not corrected for dust extinction .",
    "fluxes , in units of erg  cm@xmath10  s@xmath9 , are displayed in logarithmic scale across an area of 1.5 kpc @xmath6 1 kpc at the adopted distance of 3.36 mpc .",
    "we clearly detect the base of the north - western arm as well as `` cavities '' at the center of the galaxy where sscs a and b reside , and corresponding to the cluster surroundings where gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found a deficit of ionized gas .",
    "these regions were flagged as underflow pixels by our smoothing procedure .",
    "the s / n cut used in our image smoothing results in a limiting flux of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 erg  cm@xmath10  s@xmath9 for h@xmath3 , hei 1.08@xmath0 m , [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0 m and br@xmath1 , respectively ( corresponding to the lower limits of the flux ranges displayed in fig .",
    "the morphologies of the h@xmath3 and hei 1.08@xmath0 m emissions , which trace the location of young and massive stars , are rather similar .",
    "they exhibit two major peaks along the major axis of ngc  1569 , one on each side of the cavities and with the brighter peak located in the north - west ( nw ) half of the galaxy .",
    "relatively high fluxes are also detected along nearly the full perimeter of the cavities .",
    "the br@xmath1 emission is morphologically consistent with that of the h@xmath3 although it seems to be relatively weaker along the eastern rim of the cavities .",
    "finally , the [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0 emission , which is typically due to shocks induced by supernova explosions ( but see sect .",
    "5 ) , is as diffuse as the h and he emissions .",
    "the [ feii ] flux peaks only in the nw half of ngc  1569 and stays relatively high along the southern rim of the cavities .",
    "the very bright compact source in the eastern part of ngc  1569 is a supernova remnant ( cf .",
    "labrie & pritchet 2006 ) .",
    "we integrate the observed h@xmath3 and br@xmath1 maps of ngc  1569 over an ellipse of semi - major axis @xmath33 = 37@xmath23 ( 606 pc ) and semi - minor axis @xmath34 = 17@xmath23 ( 274 pc ) which does not include the extended h@xmath3 superbubbles , where shocks due to the galactic outflow seem to be important .",

    "1987 ) have shown that this extended [ feii ] emission can be explained by high - speed shocks such as those associated with a galactic outflow .",
    "the proposed mechanism assumes that iron atoms can be extracted from silicate grains that are preferentially destroyed via nonthermal sputtering and grain - grain collisions ( cf . also mccarthy , heckman & van breugel 1987 ; van der werf et al .",

    "given that the br@xmath1 emission comes from gas ionized by ob stars , the flux ratio [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0m / br@xmath1 is commonly used to trace the number ratio of supernovae ( sns ) to ob stars , hence the star formation history of a galaxy at fixed initial mass function .",

    "another way of looking at the spatial variation of the [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0m / br@xmath1 ratio is to integrate the dereddened flux of the [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0 m and br@xmath1 images over concentric , elliptical semi annuli and compute the [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0m / br@xmath1 flux ratio as a function of position along the semi - major axis .",

    "<S> we used the near - ir imager / spectrograph lucifer mounted on the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) to image , with sub - arcsec seeing , the local dwarf starburst ngc  1569 in the jhk bands and hei 1.08@xmath0 m , [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0 m and br@xmath1 narrow - band filters . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained high - quality spatial maps of hei 1.08@xmath0 m , [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0 m and br@xmath1 emission across the galaxy , and used them together with @xmath2/acs images of ngc  1569 in the h@xmath3 filter to derive the two - dimensional spatial map of the dust extinction and surface star formation rate density . </S>",
    "<S> we show that dust extinction ( as derived from the h@xmath3/br@xmath1 flux ratio ) is rather patchy and , on average , higher in the north - west ( nw ) portion of the galaxy [ e@xmath4(b - v ) @xmath5 0.71 mag ] than in the south - east [ e@xmath4(b - v ) @xmath5 0.57 mag ] . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the surface density of star formation rate ( computed from either the dereddened h@xmath3 or dereddened br@xmath1 image ) peaks in the nw region of ngc 1569 , reaching a value of about 4 @xmath6 10@xmath7 m@xmath8  yr@xmath9  pc@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the total star formation rate as estimated from the integrated , dereddened h@xmath3 ( or , alternatively , br@xmath1 ) luminosity is about 0.4 m@xmath8  yr@xmath9 , and the total supernova rate from the integrated , dereddened [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0 m luminosity is about 0.005 yr@xmath9 ( assuming a distance of 3.36 mpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthally averaged [ feii ] 1.64@xmath0m / br@xmath1 flux ratio is larger at the edges of the central , gas - deficient cavities ( encompassing the super star clusters a and b ) and in the galaxy outskirts . </S>",
    "<S> if we interpret this line ratio as the ratio between the average past star formation ( as traced by supernovae ) and on - going activity ( represented by ob stars able to ionize the interstellar medium ) , it would then indicate that star formation has been quenched within the central cavities and lately triggered in a ring around them . </S>",
    "<S> the number of ionizing hydrogen and helium photons as computed from the integrated , dereddened h@xmath3 and hei 1.08@xmath0 m luminosities suggests that the latest burst of star formation occurred about 4 myr ago and produced new stars with a total mass of @xmath51.8 @xmath6 10@xmath11 m@xmath8 . </S>"
