    "the observation that precision measurements of gauge couplings at scale @xmath12 by the lep experiments are consistent with the simplest supersymmetric@xcite su(5 ) grand unification@xcite ( but not with minimal _",
    "non_-supersymmetric su(5 ) ) has led many authors to seriously re - examine the expectations for sparticle masses@xcite within this framework .",
    "more recently , several studies of the collider phenomenology of supergravity models have also appeared@xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "direct constraints on such models come from non - observation of super - partners at colliding beam experiments .",
    "for instance , the non - observation of multi - jet plus missing transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) events above expected standard model ( sm ) background levels has led the cdf and d0 collaborations to conclude@xcite , @xmath13 where the considerable range in the bound is due to the dependence of the missing @xmath4 cross section on the parameters@xcite of the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) . in obtaining these mass limits , it is usually assumed that there exist ten or twelve types of mass degenerate squarks .",
    "this is usually justified by appealing to the framework of minimal supergravity models , where the sfermions are all expected to be degenerate at an ultra - high unification scale ; this degeneracy is broken when these @xmath14 mass parameters are evolved down to the electroweak scale relevant for phenomenological analyses .",
    "for the squarks of the first two generations , this evolution is dominantly governed by their ( common ) qcd interactions so that their masses are split only by the relatively small electroweak interactions . as a result , these remain essentially degenerate with a mass @xmath15 .    in contrast , the masses of third generation squarks obtain substantial contributions@xcite also from the large top family yukawa interactions , which also induce a substantial mixing@xcite between the @xmath16 and @xmath17 squarks .",
    "these interactions reduce the diagonal masses relative to @xmath15 in much the same way that they drive the higgs mass squared to negative values , resulting in the breaking of electroweak symmetry . at the weak scale ,",
    "the soft - breaking masses for @xmath18-squarks can be written in the form@xcite , @xmath19 here , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are top ( bottom ) family yukawa couplings , @xmath22 is the universal sfermion mass at the unification scale and @xmath23 are dimensionless parameters @xmath24 that can be numerically computed within a model . the term involving the bottom yukawa coupling is negligible unless @xmath25 is close to @xmath26@xcite .",
    "assuming squarks are heavier than top quarks , we expect the mass ordering @xmath27 .",
    "as already noted , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are mixed by their yukawa interactions .",
    "the @xmath18-squark mass squared matrix takes the form , @xmath28 , \\eqnum{3}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the trilinear soft susy breaking scalar coupling evaluated at the electroweak scale and @xmath30 is the superpotential higgs mixing term .",
    "the mass eigenstates ( @xmath0 and @xmath31 ) can be readily obtained by diagonalizing this matrix . for the eigenvalues",
    ", we have @xmath32 ^ 2+m_t^2 ( a_t-\\mu\\cot\\beta ) ^2\\right\\ } ^{1\\over 2}. \\eqnum{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding mass eigenstates are @xmath33 where the mixing angle @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 the freedom to adjust the soft - susy breaking parameter @xmath29 enables us to fix the lighter top squark ( the stop , or @xmath0 ) mass essentially independently of the masses of other squarks .",
    "we see that @xmath0 , which has a mass smaller than even @xmath36 , can indeed be much lighter than the first two generations of squarks .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 can easily be as light as @xmath37 50 gev even if other squarks and gluinos have masses of several hundred gev .",
    "although this is not directly relevant to our discussion , we also mention that su(2 ) gauge invariance requires that @xmath38 ( aside from @xmath39-terms ) whereas @xmath40 unless @xmath41 is very large . for moderate values of @xmath41 , @xmath30 and @xmath42 ,",
    "@xmath43-@xmath44 mixing is expected to be small so that @xmath43 and @xmath44 closely approximate the mass eigenstates .",
    "having convinced ourselves that @xmath0 can indeed be much lighter than other squarks , it is reasonable to ask what current experiments tell us about its mass .",
    "the measurement of the total width of the z boson as well as direct searches for squarks at lep@xcite imply@xcite that @xmath45 top squarks can also be pair produced at @xmath46 colliders , via @xmath47 and @xmath48 fusion diagrams .",
    "unlike squarks of the first two generations , there exists no significant cross section contribution from gluino exchange diagrams , so that @xmath49 is determined completely in terms of @xmath1 . for stops with a mass in the 50 - 125 gev range accessible to tevatron",
    "experiments the dominant decay mode is expected to be the two body @xmath50 , if it is kinematically allowed .",
    "if instead @xmath51 , then decay via flavor changing loop diagrams is expected to dominate@xcite , in which case @xmath52 . in the latter case stop production , like squark production ( but without cascade decays ) , would be signalled only by events with jets plus @xmath4 .",
    "when the chargino decay mode is accessible , stop signatures are topologically the same as those of @xmath53-quarks .",
    "we have checked at least within the mssm framework that if @xmath54 gev , the decay @xmath55 is kinematically allowed only when the two - body decay @xmath2 is also allowed .",
    "thus the three body decay to real @xmath56 bosons is never phenomenologically relevant for the discussion of @xmath18-squark signals at the tevatron .",
    "the production of @xmath0-squark pairs at the tevatron was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that @xmath57 , for equal top and stop masses .",
    "these authors , using parton level monte carlo programs , attempted to translate the cdf@xcite squark bound eq.(1 ) to a limit on the mass of @xmath0 , under the assumption that @xmath58 .",
    "they concluded that the cdf data imply a stronger bound than the lep limit in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , but only if the lightest neutralino , also assumed to be the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , has a mass of just a few gev .",
    "gev , their analysis showed that it is entirely possible that @xmath0 could have escaped detection if its mass was just above the lep bound .",
    "these authors also studied the dilepton signal from the decay @xmath60 .",
    "since their purpose was to study whether it would be identifiable in the cdf search for top quarks , they used the corresponding cdf cuts .",
    "they found that the stop signal would be dwarfed by the corresponding signal from @xmath53-quark production .",
    "since that time , the cdf experiment has more than quadrupled its data sample .",
    "furthermore , the d0 experiment has started operation and accumulated a data sample of comparable magnitude . by the end of the current run ( run i b ) , the combined integrated luminosity is expected to be @xmath61 @xmath9 ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath62 times larger than that used in the earlier analysis@xcite . on the theoretical front",
    ", the production and decay patterns of all sparticles as given by the mssm have been incorporated into the event simulation program isajet@xcite .",
    "this should allow for considerably better simulation of the signals than in ref.@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to re - examine the prospects for discovering the lighter top squark at the tevatron in the case where other squarks and gluinos are too heavy to be kinematically accessible , regardless of whether the decay @xmath63 is allowed . in light of the fact that the tevatron experiments will soon have a very large event sample , and considering the improvements in theoretical technology since the last study",
    ", we felt that a reassessment was warranted .",
    "for the @xmath4 signal we improve on our earlier study in that we use a more sophisticated simulation .",
    "we will see later that the inclusion of qcd radiation in isajet significantly affects our conclusion about the mass reach of the tevatron , particularly when @xmath64 is relatively heavy . in the case when the chargino decay of the stop is kinematically allowed , we adopt a different philosophy from our earlier study . instead of focussing on what the tevatron top _ quark _ analysis can tell us about top _ squarks _ , we devise cuts to separate the susy signal from the top signal as well as from other sm backgrounds .",
    "we then find that , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath10 @xmath9 , experiments at the tevatron should be able to search for @xmath0 as heavy as about 100 gev , even in this case .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly describe our simulation of stop events at the tevatron in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate tevatron signatures from @xmath52 decay , and show regions of the @xmath1 _ vs. _ @xmath65 parameter space that ought to be accessible to tevatron collider experiments . in sec .",
    "iv , we examine both the single lepton plus jets signature as well as the dilepton plus jets signature , when @xmath50 is the dominant stop decay .",
    "again , we show regions of parameter space explorable via these modes .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "v with a summary of our results along with some general remarks .",
    "we use the program isajet version 7.07@xcite to simulate events from the production of @xmath0 pairs at the tevatron .",
    "once produced , the stop rapidly decays via @xmath2 if this decay is kinematically allowed ; if not , we assume that it decays via @xmath66 with a branching fraction of 100% . in other words ,",
    "the decay patterns of the stop are determined by sparticle masses and do not depend on the stop or gaugino mixing angles .",
    "furthermore , in this latter case , the @xmath4 signal from stop production is completely determined in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath65 and is independent of any other parameters .",
    "if , on the other hand , the stop is heavy enough to decay via the chargino mode , its signals obviously depend on the decay patterns of the chargino . for any set of input parameters ,",
    "isajet then decays the daughter chargino with branching fractions as given by the mssm . over a large range of model parameters ,",
    "the @xmath67-mediated amplitude dominates the decays of the chargino , so that the branching fraction for the decay @xmath68 is about 11% . in our computations",
    ", we will use the supergravity motivated choice @xmath69 as our default value and fix @xmath70 .",
    "this then implies @xmath71 , which together with the stop mass fixes the kinematics of the events .",
    "effects from radiation off initial and final state partons , fragmentation of the @xmath72 or @xmath11 daughters of the stop , final state hadronization and underlying event activity are incorporated in isajet .",
    "we have modelled the experimental conditions at the tevatron by incorporating a toy calorimeter with segmentation @xmath73 and extending to @xmath74 in our simulation .",
    "we have assumed an energy resolution of @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) for the hadronic ( electromagnetic ) calorimeter .",
    "jets are defined to be hadron clusters with @xmath77 gev within a cone of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we consider an electron ( muon ) to be isolated if @xmath80 gev ( @xmath81 gev ) and the hadronic energy in a cone with @xmath82 about the lepton does not exceed @xmath83(@xmath84 gev ) .",
    "non - isolated electrons are included as part of the accompanying hadron cluster .",
    "when the chargino is heavier than @xmath85 , the @xmath0 in the mass range of interest essentially decays@xcite via @xmath3 so that stop pair production would be signalled by events with charm jet(s ) together with @xmath4 . in our analysis@xcite of this signature ,",
    "we have imposed the following cdf - inspired@xcite cuts on the signal :    * ( _ i _ ) we require at least two jets in each event with at least one jet in the central region , @xmath86 . all jets are required to be separated by at least @xmath87 in azimuth from @xmath88 . *",
    "if @xmath89 , we further require @xmath90(@xmath91,@xmath92 ) @xmath93 . *",
    "( _ iii _ ) we veto events containing leptons ( from the @xmath72-jet ) with @xmath94(@xmath95)@xmath96 gev to reduce the background from @xmath97 ( @xmath98 or @xmath30 ) .",
    "we have checked that this leads to very little loss of signal . *",
    "( _ iv _ ) we require @xmath99 gev@xcite to reduce backgrounds from qcd heavy flavours and mismeasured jets .    sm backgrounds from heavy flavor production ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) and multi - jet production ( with substantial jet energy mismeasurement ) are very dependent on a detailed detector simulation , but are expected@xcite to be small , given a large enough @xmath4 cut and lepton veto .",
    "the major backgrounds we consider here are from vector boson production , and include ( _ a _ ) @xmath102 production , ( _ b _ ) @xmath103 production ( where the hadronically decaying @xmath104 can be one of the jets ) , and ( _ c _ ) @xmath105 , where extra jets come from initial state qcd radiation .    the @xmath4 distribution , before any cuts , from stop events at a @xmath106 collider with @xmath107 tev is illustrated in fig . 1 for two representative choices of @xmath0 and @xmath64 masses : ( _ a _ ) @xmath108 gev , @xmath109 gev , and ( _ b _ ) @xmath110 gev , @xmath111 gev . also shown",
    "are the corresponding distribution from the @xmath56 and @xmath112 backgrounds listed above which have been computed using isajet .",
    "we have used the set i structure function of eichten _ et . al._@xcite in our computation . as expected , the @xmath113 background peaks at @xmath114 , while the @xmath4 spectra from the other backgrounds are softer .",
    "we see that the @xmath115 gev cut ( _ iv _ ) is very effective in cutting these backgrounds with a factor of @xmath116 loss of signal . nevertheless , even after cuts ( _ i - iv _ ) , the @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) background is 23 @xmath119 ( 12 @xmath119 ) in contrast to the signal cross section of 9.2 @xmath119 and 1.9 @xmath119 for our representative cases introduced above .",
    "the lepton veto reduces the @xmath120 background to negligible levels .",
    "we have also checked that @xmath121 is small compared to the other backgrounds .    to facilitate further separation of the stop signal from sm background ,",
    "we have studied the correlation between @xmath90 , the transverse plane opening angle between @xmath88 and the nearest jet , and @xmath94(fast jet ) for the @xmath4 event sample .",
    "we have illustrated this by scatter plots in fig . 2 for the two signal cases and for the dominant backgrounds .",
    "we see that by further requiring ,    * ( _ v _ ) @xmath122 gev for @xmath123 ; else @xmath124 gev ,    we are able to substantially reduce the main sm backgrounds , with relatively modest loss of signal ( particularly for the @xmath125 case , where the signal was indeed small compared to the backgrounds )",
    ".    the resulting cross section from @xmath126 production at the tevatron , after cuts ( _ i - v _ ) , is illustrated by the contour plot in the @xmath127 plane in fig .",
    "3 . also shown",
    "are the sm backgrounds after these same cuts .",
    "we note that although for certain regions of this parameter plane the chargino decay mode of the stop will necessarily be kinematically open _ within the mssm framework _",
    ", for the purposes of this figure , we have assumed that the charginos are too heavy to be produced via decays of the stops , and used the @xmath128 command in isajet to decay the stop via @xmath3 .",
    "we terminate the contours for stop masses where the three body decay @xmath55 becomes accessible , since then , the branching fraction for the two body mode @xmath66 mode is no longer unity .",
    "several features of fig .",
    "3 are worth noting .    1 .",
    "we see that the signal cross section after all cuts exceeds 1 @xmath119 for @xmath1 as large as @xmath129 gev even if @xmath64 is as heavy as 50 gev . for this cross section contour ,",
    "as many as 40 stop events may already be present in the accumulated data sample of the tevatron .",
    "the dominant sm background source is @xmath130 production , where the hadronically decaying @xmath104 is counted as one of the jets . since @xmath104 jets almost always have a charged multiplicity of 1 or 3 , it should be possible to discriminate the bulk of these events from the signal by vetoing low charged multiplicity jets .",
    "we show this background to allow the reader to assess the @xmath104-jet discrimination factor which is necessary for sufficient background rejection .",
    "if a rejection 80% of @xmath117 events is achieved without substantial loss of signal , the stop signal exceeds combined background for @xmath131 gev , and @xmath132 gev .",
    "we note that the @xmath133 background can be reliably subtracted if a large enough data sample is accumulated for directly measuring high @xmath94 @xmath112 bosons decaying to leptons , and using the @xmath112 branching ratios measured at lep .",
    "4 .   unlike as in ref.@xcite , where it was concluded that the stop signal was very small for @xmath134 gev , we see that the signal is quite robust even if @xmath64 is heavy .",
    "in fact , we have checked that there is a significant signal level even if @xmath64 is nearly degenerate with @xmath0  for instance , for @xmath135 gev = 105 gev , the cross section after all cuts is 0.25 @xmath119 , which is more than 2% of the total stop production cross section of 11 @xmath119 .",
    "the sharp fall - off of the cross section with increasing @xmath65 in the earlier parton level simulation occured because the daughter charm quarks rapidly became too soft to satisfy the jet requirements .",
    "in the more realistic isajet simulation , the stop pair can be produced with a substantial @xmath94 since it can recoil against jets from qcd radiation . for @xmath136 ,",
    "the stops give most of their momentum to the heavy @xmath64 , so that @xmath137 and the jets come from qcd radiation as , for instance , in the @xmath138 background .",
    "if , as anticipated , the tevatron experiments accumulate around 100  @xmath9 of integrated luminosity by the current run , we may anticipate at least 50 or more signal events in the data for @xmath131 gev even if @xmath64 is relatively heavy . although the background level , as read off from fig .",
    "3 , would be around 200 events ( assuming a @xmath117 rejection of 80% ) , we should keep in mind that the actual background , after @xmath138 events are subtracted , will be considerably smaller .",
    "a several standard deviation signal should be possible for stops as heavy as 100 - 125 gev .",
    "a precise evaluation of the tevatron reach , which should take into account detector - dependent backgrounds , is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "up to this point , we have made no use of the fact that the signal always contains @xmath72-quark jets .",
    "it is clear that sm backgrounds would be considerably reduced if it were to be possible to tag at least one of the @xmath72-quarks .",
    "this led us to consider the possibility of using a muon from the semi - leptonic decay of one of the @xmath72 quarks as a tag .",
    "the signal would then consist of @xmath139 gev ) , where the muon is _ within _ a cone of @xmath82 about one of the jets . for these muon - tagged events we require , in addition to ( _ i - iv _ ) above , that    * @xmath94(@xmath30)@xmath140 gev for the muon to be identifiable , and * either @xmath90(@xmath141,@xmath88)@xmath142 or @xmath94(@xmath143)@xmath144 gev .",
    "the signal cross section contours , with these cuts , are shown in fig .",
    "4 together with estimates of backgrounds from @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 or @xmath148 processes . to estimate these , we have generated 14k ( 130k ) @xmath56 ( @xmath112 ) events of each type , and find that just 8 , 5 and 6 events , respectively , pass our cuts .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that isajet does not include the full @xmath149 matrix elements for @xmath150 or @xmath151 production ; in our simulation , these events come from radiation of initial state gluons followed by splitting into @xmath101 or @xmath100 pairs .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "4 that even with an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath9 , there will be only 5 - 10 tagged events for sparticle masses such that the @xmath4 signal shown in fig .",
    "3 might be difficult to observe above the background .",
    "we further see that the 0.2 @xmath119 contour in fig . 4 ( which roughly maps out the region where @xmath152 ) essentially tracks the contour where the @xmath4 signal in fig .",
    "3 equals the @xmath153 background .",
    "we thus conclude that the use of muon tagging does not extend the reach of the tevatron to discover stop squarks in the @xmath4 channel .",
    "nevertheless , observation of @xmath30-tagged @xmath4 events could be important , even at low rates : non - observation of these events at expected rates would rule out a @xmath52 decay hypothesis .",
    "if @xmath154 , the stop decays via the two - body chargino mode with a branching fraction of nearly 100% .",
    "charginos with @xmath155 gev typically decay via the three - body mode @xmath156 ( @xmath157 or @xmath158 ) mediated by a virtual @xmath56 , @xmath159 or @xmath160 .",
    "since sfermion masses are likely to be larger than @xmath161 , the @xmath67 mediated decays dominate over large ranges of susy parameters , so that the branching fractions for chargino decays are , generally speaking , close to those of the @xmath56-boson .",
    "it is only when the lightest neutralino is dominantly a @xmath162 gaugino that the @xmath163 coupling is dynamically suppressed ; then the sfermion - mediated amplitudes become especially important .",
    "if , in addition , sleptons are also considerably lighter than squarks as is the case in the no scale limit of supergravity models , the branching fractions for chargino leptonic decays can be significantly enhanced . here , we have mainly confined our attention to the more typical case where @xmath67-mediated decays indeed dominate .",
    "it is , however , worth remembering that the leptonic signals discussed here may be enhanced in some regions of parameter space .",
    "if both the charginos in a stop pair production event decay hadronically , the signal is qualitatively the same as that in sec .",
    "iii : _ i.e. _ , consisting of @xmath164 events . since",
    ", in the present case , the @xmath64 is always produced via a two - step cascade , we expect@xcite that the @xmath4 spectrum would be softer than that shown in fig .  1",
    ", so that sm backgrounds to the signal could be problematic . for this reason , we focus on the signal where one ( or both ) of the charginos decay leptonically .",
    "this stop signal , which consists of events with 1 or 2 isolated leptons together with jet(s ) and @xmath4 ( from the undetected @xmath64 s and neutrino(s ) ) , has the same event topology as the canonical signal for top quarks .",
    "it is , therefore , essential to devise strategies to separate the stop signal events from top background , keeping in mind that cuts designed to optimize the top quark signal may not be suitable for the detection of @xmath0 squarks@xcite .      at the tevatron ,",
    "single lepton events from the cascade decays of gluinos and squarks are expected@xcite to be swamped by backgrounds from high @xmath94 @xmath56 production , with the isolated lepton coming from the decay of the @xmath56 .",
    "what is different about stop events is that each event contains two hard , central @xmath11-quark jets which may be tagged using a silicon microvertex detector . in our computation , we assume@xcite 40% of the events have the vertex within the svx barrel .",
    "for these events , we take the efficiency for detecting @xmath165-hadrons with @xmath166 gev and @xmath167 to be 30% . in our analysis of the @xmath168 signal ,",
    "we have required the following :    * ( _ i _ ) one isolated @xmath169 ( @xmath30 ) with @xmath170 gev ( 5 gev ) , * ( _ ii _ ) two or more jets with at least one of the jets in the central region @xmath171 , * ( _ iii _ ) @xmath172 gev , and * ( _ iv _ ) at least one tagged @xmath165-hadron .",
    "the main sm backgrounds to the single lepton signal come from @xmath173 production , and from @xmath174 production and are shown in table i for @xmath175 gev and @xmath176 gev along with the signal with @xmath177 gev , @xmath178 gev and @xmath179 gev .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath11-tagging capability as assumed above is absolutely essential for the identification of the signal above the @xmath56 background .",
    "isajet generates @xmath180 events from initial state gluon radiation followed by gluon splitting , using the usual collinear qcd matrix elements of the parton shower model .",
    "we have checked that without the @xmath11-tagging requirement ( _ iv _ ) , the signal to @xmath56 background ratio would be degraded by a factor @xmath181 .",
    "we see from table i that the stop signal is considerably smaller than the total sm background .",
    "we have studied distributions that may serve to enhance the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "the multiplicity distribution of jets in the stop signal ( solid ) and in the top background for @xmath175 gev ( dotted ) and @xmath176 gev ( dashed - dotted ) , after cuts ( _ i - iv _ ) is shown in fig .",
    "5_a_. we have illustrated the signal for @xmath177 gev , @xmath178 gev , and @xmath179 gev . as expected",
    ", the top background has a significantly larger jet multiplicity than the signal .",
    "we have checked that this is true even if @xmath0 is as heavy as 130 gev . to enhance the stop signal to top background ratio _ without much loss of signal",
    "_ , we have required    * ( _ v _ ) @xmath182 .    in this choice",
    "we have been guided by the fact that the number of signal events in the data sample of the _ current _ tevatron run , which is expected to accumulate an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath9 , is not very large .",
    "it is clear , however , that if a significantly larger data sample is available ( as should be possible after the main injector upgrade ) , choosing @xmath183 ( recall we always require at least two jets in the signal ) optimizes the stop signal to top background ratio .",
    "the signal - to - background ratio can be further improved by recognizing that in both the top and @xmath56 backgrounds the lepton and much of the @xmath4 come from the decay of a single @xmath56-boson .",
    "we thus expect that the transverse mass distribution @xmath184 for the background exhibits a characteristic jacobian peak while the signal should show no such feature . toward this end",
    ", we show this distribution , after cuts ( _ i - v _ ) in fig .",
    "5_b _ for the same signal case as in fig",
    ". 5_a _ ( solid ) , the @xmath113 background ( dashes ) and the @xmath174 background for @xmath175 gev ( dotted ) .",
    "the transverse mass distribution will thus exhibit substantial distortion for low @xmath185 if a signal is present .",
    "we see that by further requiring ,    * ( _ vi _ ) @xmath186 gev ,    we are able to eliminate a large fraction of the background with a relatively modest loss of signal .",
    "the background , including cuts ( _ v _ ) and ( _ vi _ ) , is shown in the last column in table i. we see that a signal - to - background ratio of unity is possible for @xmath187 gev , even for the unfavourable @xmath175 gev case .",
    "finally , we examined whether tails from direct @xmath148 production , which has an enormous cross section at the tevatron , could possibly fake the stop signal .",
    "we simulated 3 m @xmath148 events , and found that only one event passes our cuts . applying the @xmath11-tagging efficiency",

    "the corresponding @xmath64 mass is also shown on the right .",
    "we have cut off the contours for @xmath191 gev since this region is excluded@xcite within the mssm framework .",
    "we see that unlike fig .",
    "3 , where the cross section remains substantial even for @xmath64 masses close to @xmath1 , the single lepton signal rapidly decreases when @xmath1 approaches @xmath192 .",
    "this is because the @xmath11-jet becomes very soft and so is not tagged .",
    "we also see that @xmath193 signal events ( compared to a background of 6 - 11 events , depending on @xmath194 ) may be expected in a tevatron data sample of 100 @xmath9 for @xmath195 gev if @xmath196 gev .",
    "this corresponds to about a @xmath197 effect in the data sample expected to be accumulated by the end of the current tevatron run , _ provided that sufficient @xmath11-tagging efficiency is achieved .",
    "_ in the longer term , the tevatron may be able to probe a stop mass in excess of 100 gev in this channel , particularly after the main injector becomes operational .",
    "finally , we consider the dilepton signal arising from @xmath126 events where both the charginos decay leptonically . for this signal ,",
    "we require :    * ( _ i _ ) _ at least _ two unlike sign , isolated leptons ( @xmath169 or @xmath30 ) , with @xmath80 gev and @xmath81 gev , * ( _ ii _ ) @xmath198 ( to reduce drell - yan background ) , * ( _ iii _ ) at least one jet with @xmath171 , * ( _ iv _ ) @xmath172 gev .    the sm backgrounds to this signal , which dominantly come from @xmath174 production and @xmath56 pair production , are shown in table ii after the cuts ( _ i - iv _ ) .",
    "also shown is the bound on this cross section we get from a simulation of 10 m @xmath148 events , none of which pass our cuts .",
    "for comparison , we also show the signal for the same case as in table i. we see that the signal is smaller than the sm backgrounds even for the heavier top case . unlike the case for the single lepton signal , there is no obvious kinematic variable like the transverse mass that can be used to enhance the signal relative to the background .",
    "we note , however , that the leptons from the three - body chargino decays are expected to be softer than background , which has two - body decays of real @xmath56 bosons .    with this in mind",
    ", we examined several distributions ( to be discussed shortly ) that may help to distinguish the top squark signal from the sm backgrounds .",
    "we found that the distribution of the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the two leptons plus the @xmath4 in each event , which we refer to as `` bigness '' , or @xmath165 , @xmath199 provides optimal distinction between the signal and the ( dominant ) top quark background .",
    "this distribution is shown in fig .",
    "7_a _ for the signal from a 100 gev stop decaying into a chargino ( solid ) and for the @xmath174 background for @xmath175 gev",
    ". as anticipated , the distribution is considerably harder for the background than for the signal ; requiring    * ( _ v _ ) @xmath200 gev ,    in addition to cuts ( _ i - iv _ ) , significantly improves the signal to background ratio .",
    "the sm backgrounds , including this cut , are shown in the last column of table ii .",
    "the difference in the signal and background `` bigness '' distributions is illustrated in an alternative fashion in fig .",
    "7_b _ , where we have shown on the horizontal ( vertical ) axis the signal ( top background ) cross section integrated up to the value of @xmath165 marked on the curve in this figure .",
    "in other words , the signal ( background ) cross section is 80 @xmath188 ( 15 @xmath188 ) if @xmath201 gev .",
    "it is clear that the best distributions for distinguishing the signal from background are those where the slope of the corresponding curve remains small for a large distance after which it turns upward .",
    "furthermore , since we can read off the value of @xmath165 for any point along the curve , fig .",
    "7_b _ enables us to easily find an optimal value for the cut .",
    "we see that @xmath200 gev that we obtained from the histogram in fig .",
    "7_a _ is indeed a good choice for the cut .    in fig .",
    "8 , we have shown the analogous curves for other combinations of the lepton momenta and @xmath4 that may serve to distinguish the signal from background for the same cases as in fig .  7 .",
    "we show ( _ a _ ) the bigness distribution ( again , for ease of comparison ) , ( _ b _ ) the @xmath4 distribution , ( _ c _ ) the distribution of the scalar sum , @xmath202 , and ( _ d _ ) the @xmath94 distribution of the hard lepton . from the shapes of these curves , it should be clear that the `` bigness '' distribution is indeed the best one to distinguish between stop and top production .",
    "we have illustrated the @xmath94 distributions of the two leptons in the dilepton signal as well as the corresponding @xmath4 distributions , after cuts ( _ i - v _ ) , in fig .",
    "9 for ( _ a _ ) @xmath177 gev , @xmath203 gev and @xmath204 gev , ( _ b _ ) @xmath177 gev , @xmath205 gev and @xmath206 gev , and ( _ c _ ) @xmath207 gev , @xmath205 gev and @xmath206 gev .",
    "the fast lepton and @xmath4 distributions in cases ( _ a _ ) and ( _ b _ ) are considerably harder than in case ( _ c _ ) where the stop is rather light and @xmath208 is small .",
    "also , for a given value of @xmath1 , these distributions become softer with decreasing difference between the chargino and the lsp mass .",
    "the slow lepton @xmath94 distributions are , however , backed up against the cut .",
    "these distributions also enable the reader to assess the effect on the signal if the cut on the lepton @xmath94 is further relaxed .",
    "clearly , capability for detection of leptons near the edge of the @xmath209 cut ( _ i _ ) in events triggered by jets and/or @xmath4 is required in order not to lose too much of the signal .    in fig .",
    "10 , we show the cross section contours for the dilepton signal after all the cuts for @xmath210 , and @xmath70 in the @xmath211 plane .",
    "the region below the horizontal dashed line is experimentally excluded@xcite within the mssm framework , while in the region above the sloping dashed line , the stop decays via the flavour - changing loop decay mode analysed in sec .",
    "we see that while the signal is rather small , it exceeds the sm backgrounds for @xmath212 gev ( 130 gev ) for @xmath175 gev ( 170 gev ) even if @xmath64 is heavy . in a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath9 that should be accumulated by the end of the current tevatron run , we may expect @xmath213 10 signal events compared to a background of 3 - 6 events , depending on the top quark mass , if @xmath187 gev .",
    "thus the tevatron experiments should soon be able to probe top squark masses up to just under 100 gev ( larger , if the top is discovered and found to be heavy ) even in the dilepton channel .",
    "this should increase to 120 - 130 gev after the main injector becomes operational and the top turns out to be heavy .",
    "we remark that unlike as for the single lepton signal , the detection of the signal in the dilepton channel does not rely on the capability for tagging displaced vertices .",
    "we remind the reader that in all our computations up to this point , we have chosen parameters so that the leptonic branching fraction for chargino decays is 11% per lepton family . as mentioned above , this may be considerably enhanced@xcite if sleptons are lighter than squarks and the @xmath64 is mainly a u(1 ) gaugino .",
    "for instance , for @xmath214 gev , @xmath215 gev with @xmath41 = 20 ( which yields @xmath178 gev , @xmath216 gev and slepton masses around 125 gev ) , this branching fraction increases to about 30% . for this case",
    ", we find the @xmath11-tagged single - lepton ( dilepton ) cross section after all cuts of 220 @xmath188 ( 780 @xmath188 ) for a stop mass of 100 gev to be compared with 140 @xmath188 ( 130 @xmath188 ) in table i. our point here is to illustrate that the leptonic cross sections can indeed be significantly enhanced for reasonable choices of susy parameters , and that these enhancements are in keeping with expectations from the increase in the leptonic branching fraction of the chargino .",
    "in such scenarios , it may be possible to probe stop masses significantly beyond 100 gev by the end of run i b of the tevatron . to illustrate , we have checked that for @xmath217 gev , the choice @xmath218 gev , @xmath219 gev and @xmath41 = 20 , yields cross sections of 63 @xmath188 and 210 @xmath188 in the single - lepton and dilepton channels , respectively .",
    "it is amusing to see that the dilepton signal can be considerably larger than the signal in the single - lepton channel .",
    "we have seen that , in the framework of supergravity models , the lighter of the two top squarks ( @xmath0 ) may be very light even if the other squarks and gluinos have masses of several hundred gev .",
    "current tevatron experimental analyses@xcite on squark masses are not applicable to a single light top squark , so that currently the best limit is still @xmath220 gev , based on non - observation of a signal at lep .",
    "hence , one of most favorable routes towards the discovery of supersymmetry at the fermilab tevatron collider may be to search for the light top squark .",
    "we have shown in this paper that tevatron experiments ought to be able to explore top squark masses of @xmath10 gev , given an integrated luminosity of @xmath10 @xmath9 .",
    "thus , tevatron collider experiments ought to be able to either discover supersymmetry via the top squark , or place an important new limit on its mass",
    ". such a limit can serve to constrain the gut scale parameter space of supergravity models , where the @xmath0 mass is driven to small values by a large top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "in fact , model builders already have to take care to ensure that @xmath221 is not driven negative , leading to breaking of electromagnetic and colour gauge symmetries@xcite .    if @xmath222 , then @xmath52 , so collider experiments ought to search for @xmath223 , leading to a multi - jet plus @xmath4 signature . even after suitable cuts , significant backgrounds from @xmath56 and @xmath112 production remain .",
    "the @xmath4 signal cross section , which depends only on the @xmath0 and @xmath64 masses , is conveniently summarized by cross section contours in the @xmath224 plane in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "assuming that the backgrounds can indeed be reliably suppressed / subtracted out from the data sample ( via @xmath104-jet veto , @xmath112+jets total normalization , _ etc . _ ) , we see that @xmath0 masses of @xmath225 gev ought to be accessible to tevatron experiments by the end of the current run .    if @xmath226 , then @xmath50 , so collider experiments ought to search for @xmath227 , where @xmath228 or @xmath229 .",
    "just as for the top quark search , signals appear most promising in the single and dilepton final states . for single lepton final states ,",
    "@xmath165-tagging capability is essential to veto the large @xmath56+multi - jet background .",
    "the results of our computation of the single - lepton and the dilepton signal are summarized in fig . 6 and fig .",
    "10 , respectively .",
    "given sufficient @xmath165-tagging capability , @xmath0 masses to 80 - 100 gev ought to be explorable at the tevatron via the single lepton channel . for the dilepton signal ,",
    "major backgrounds come from @xmath230 and @xmath231 production .",
    "requiring `` soft '' dilepton events , ( _ e.g. _ , requiring @xmath232 gev ) , allows sufficient rejection of background that , as before , stop masses of @xmath10 gev ought to be probed at the tevatron by the end of the current run .",
    "the analysis in the present paper is a conservative one , in that an additional source of stop squark production , @xmath233 , has been neglected .",
    "this decay mode , which can have branching fractions of up to @xmath234 , would contribute an additional signal , as well as diminish the sm top quark background@xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether the observation of a top quark signal at a rate consistent with sm expectations could be used to independently constrain @xmath1 at a top factory .",
    "we have also been conservative in that for the leptonic signals from stop production shown in figs .",
    "6 and 10 , we have chosen parameters so that the branching fractions for leptonic decays of charginos are essentially the same as those of the @xmath56 boson ; as discussed in the text , the single lepton ( dilepton ) signals may be enhanced by a factor of @xmath371.5 ( @xmath376 ) for certain ranges of susy parameters .    in summary ,",
    "the search for stop squarks adds a new avenue to the search for supersymmetry at the tevatron collider .",
    "light top squarks have a significant degree of theoretical motivation .",
    "we have attempted to show in this paper that our experimental colleagues ought to be able either to discover top squarks at the tevatron , or to significantly extend the limit on their mass .",
