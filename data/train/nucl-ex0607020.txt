    "this systematic effect is highly dependent on the operating conditions of the experiment .",
    "while experiments in small vessels and with high pressure buffer gas are expected to be relatively insensitive to the systematic effect , each of the proposed experiments will have to be analyzed in detail to judge its sensitivity to the effect and to find methods of dealing with it .    in this work",
    "we introduce an analytic form of the correlation function which determines the behavior of the frequency shift @xcite and show in detail how it depends on the operating conditions of the experiment . for clarity",
