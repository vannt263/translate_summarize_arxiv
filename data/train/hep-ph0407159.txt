    "the yukawa coupling of the higgs boson to the heaviest quark , the top quark , is of great interest for the study of the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking and the generation of masses .",
    "while the yukawa couplings to bottom and charm quarks and to tau leptons and muons are in principle accessible through the higgs boson decay branching ratios , the higgs boson decay into top quark pairs is kinematically forbidden for light higgs bosons as they are favoured by theory and electroweak precision data .",
    "the only standard model process that probes the top yukawa coupling at tree level is the associated production of a  pair with a higgs boson .",
    "this process occurs at the lhc ( mainly ) as well as at the lc ( ) . in the latter case",
    "the cross section is only significant at centre  of  mass energies in excess of 800  gev . at the lhc , the final states that have been investigated so far",
    "are @xcite and @xcite , the @xmath8 final state is under study  @xcite . at tree level ,",
    "their production rates are proportional to @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be measured accurately in a model independent way at the lc from the corresponding decay branching ratios @xcite .",
    "these can be measured already at a first phase of the lc (  between 350 and 500 gev ) .",
    "thus , the combination of the measurements of both machines can be used to determine the value of @xmath13 without model assumptions and presumable before a second phase of the lc ( @xmath14 tev ) would come into operation .",
    "the results from the following atlas analyses of the  process are used :    \\1 .  with bbq@xmath15 and  @xcite ;    \\2 .  with  and two like - sign leptons  @xcite ;    \\3 .  with  and three leptons  @xcite .",
    "the expected numbers of selected signal and background events in the three channels for various higgs masses and total integrated luminosities of 30   and 300   are listed in tables  [ tab : lhcbb ] and [ tab : lhcww ] .",
    "the results obtained in this sub - section are based on the anticipated data sample of _ one _ lhc detector , with the luminosity per detector quoted above .    from the expected event numbers we first estimate the uncertainty ( statistical and systematic ) on the measured cross section @xmath16 .",
    "further uncertainties arise when @xmath16 is compared to the theoretical prediction as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the uncertainty on the observed cross section @xmath16 is calculated as @xmath18    here , @xmath19 is number of signal ( background ) events .",
    "@xmath20 is the uncertainty on the background determination from sideband data ( 10% in the @xmath21 channel at high luminosity , 5% otherwise ) .",
    "@xmath22 is the error on the integrated luminosity ( 5% ) and @xmath23 is the error on the determination of the efficiency .",
    "this error involves uncertainties on the tagging efficiency for individual b - jets ( 3% ) and leptons ( 3% from isolation requirement and 2% from reconstruction efficiency ) and an overall detector efficiency uncertainty of 2% ( following  @xcite ) .",
    "the total value of @xmath23 is then calculated for each channel individually depending on the number of leptons and b - jets .",
    "the expeced error including systematic uncertainties and taking into account only the statistical error of each channel is shown in table  [ tab : lhc2 ] .",
    "for the decay mode the signal and background from the two lepton and three lepton channels are added together since their signal contributions are exclusive and the overlap in the background is small .",
    "the obtained result is consistent with the study presented in  @xcite .",
