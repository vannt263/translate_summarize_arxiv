    "the inset extends the data up to 42 000 @xmath4 .",
    "a strong temperature dependence is observed in the low frequency range but becomes weaker at higher frequencies .",
    "two specific features show temperature dependent amplitudes : a broad shoulder at @xmath17 400 @xmath4 and a less obvious depression in reflectance at 175 @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , signatures of well - known transverse optical phonons can be seen as sharp minima in the low temperature spectra  @xcite . at low temperature",
    "the overall curvature of the reflectance is negative at low frequencies changing to a positive curvature at high frequency , which gives rise to an inflection point at @xmath17 700 @xmath4 .",
    "the inset shows the high frequency reflectance with a prominent plasma edge at 13 000 @xmath4 and a relatively weak temperature dependence above 25 000 @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ reffit ] shows the lowest frequency range on an expanded scale .",
    "in addition to the transverse phonons , we observe a new feature at 175 @xmath4 , that appears below 171 k , and is denoted s1 .",
    "the thin lines are the measured reflectance curves and the solid thick lines are oscillator fits where the phonons have been modeled as drude - lorentz oscillators .",
    "the electronic background is represented as a broad drude peak in the normal state and a two - fluid model with an additional delta function at the origin in the superconducting state .",
    "the parameters used in the fit are shown in table i. from the fit we get a superconducting condensate density of 72 @xmath18 10@xmath19 @xmath20 expressed as the square of a plasma frequency in @xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to a penetration depth of 1900  . in comparison ,",
    "the recent gd zero - field electron spin resonance ( esr ) measurements on samples from the same source yield a penetration depth of 2000   and are shown as open circles at very low frequency at 28 k  @xcite .",
    "our estimated overall error in the absolute value of the reflectance of @xmath21 0.5 % translates to a @xmath21 300   error in penetration depth .",
    "we conclude that our data are in agreement with the esr results , consistent with errors associated with the measurement of absolute reflectance . if we assume an overall monotonic variation of the fitted curves with temperature , we can estimate , from the deviation from this monotonicity , a relative error of 0.2 % for the temperature dependence of the reflectance .",
    "finally , from the noise level of the spectra , estimated to be 0.05 % at 300 @xmath4 and rising to 0.3 % at 100 @xmath4 , we can set an upper limit of 250 @xmath4 to the plasma frequency of any phonon features we could have missed above 200 @xmath4 .",

    "[ reffit ] to investigate the sources of error arising from the low frequency extrapolations .",

    "the bottom panel of figure  [ sigma ] shows the optical conductivity without the four phonon modes obtained through the subtraction of the fitted drude - lorentz conductivities from the measured conductivity .",
    "several features stand out .",
    "first , there is a prominent onset of conductivity that appears at low temperature around 400 @xmath4 .",
    "this feature is common to all cuprate superconductors and was identified early on as an onset of scattering from a bosonic mode@xcite .",
    "secondly , a strong peak at @xmath17 180 @xmath4 , designated s1 , grows as the temperature is lowered . at lower frequencies , below 150 @xmath4",
    ", there appears to be an additional strong absorption band , but any structure here must be interpreted with caution since they are derived from reflectance data close to unity which are subject to large systematic errors .",
    "finally , at higher frequencies , there is a broad continuous background absorption that extends up to the plasma frequency and has been attributed to the influence of strong correlations  @xcite .",
    "we define the effective number of carriers per copper atom in terms of the partial sum rule : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the free electron mass and @xmath33 is the volume per copper atom , 57.7 @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ sumrule ] shows @xmath34 calculated from the optical conductivity . in the frequency region",
    "shown @xmath34 increase uniformly with frequency and temperature in the normal state .     shown as dashed and solid curves .",
    "the spectral weight increases monotonically with temperature and frequency except for the 28 k curve ( heavy solid curve ) in the superconducting state where there is a loss of spectral weight to the condensate and the curve is sharply lowered .",
    "the curve marked @xmath35 is an estimate of the spectral weight of the superconducting condensate .",
    "the curve marked @xmath36 is a plot of the condensate density obtained independently from the imaginary part of @xmath37.,width=336 ]     there is an increase in spectral weight as the temperature is lowered signaling a line narrowing on this frequency scale .",
    "below @xmath3 there is strong loss of spectral weight to the superconducting condensate .",
    "there is no evidence of any precursors to superconductivity at 67 k. in the inset we show @xmath34 at 295 k.,width=336 ]    in the superconducting state at 28 k , shown in figure  [ sumrule ] as a heavy solid curve , there is a dramatic loss of spectral weight due to the formation of the superconducting condensate .",
    "the effective number of carriers per copper atom in the condensate can be estimated from the partial sum rule by subtracting the normal state curve at 67 k from the superconducting curve at 28 k , also shown in the figure .",
    "the resulting difference curve rises rapidly at low frequency and saturates at a value of @xmath38 above 1000 @xmath4 . to find a better value of @xmath39 we need to estimate the normal state curve at 28 k. we do this by extrapolating the temperature dependence in the normal state to 28 k ( see fig .",
    "[ difference ] ) .",
    "with the corrected value of @xmath40 at 28 k we get a more accurate value of @xmath41 .",
    "the condensate density can also be estimated from the imaginary part of the conductivity provided the contribution from the residual conductivity is not included _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath42=0.0283 $ ] where @xmath43 is the residual quasiparticle conductivity in the superconducting state .",
    "figure  [ sumrule ] shows both @xmath39 and @xmath36 and it is clear that the two curves ( when corrected ) approach one another closely and the two methods differ by 2.5 % well within our 5 % estimated experimental error .",
    "there have been several reports of ab - plane spectral weight changes on entering the superconducting state , in other high @xmath3 cuprates  @xcite at the 1 to 2 % level , but it should be noted that systematic errors in the absolute value of reflectance have a large influence on the magnitude of both @xmath39 and @xmath36 , although the error of the _ difference _ is smaller .",
    "we estimate that our error in @xmath39 and @xmath36 is 30  % but less than 5  % in the difference @xmath44 .",
    "thus , at this point , we are unable to conclude from our data that there is evidence for any added or missing low frequency spectral weight when the superconducting state forms in the ortho ii y123 .",
    "figure  [ difference ] shows the temperature dependence of the partial spectral weight at various frequencies referred to the spectral weight at 300 k. we note that below 16 000 @xmath4 the spectral weight increases as the temperature is lowered while above this frequency there is a decrease . at 16 000",
    "@xmath4 the partial spectral weight is temperature independent . since this frequency is close to our estimate of the limit of the free carrier conductivity ,",
    "we conclude that there is a transfer of spectral weight to low frequencies as the temperature is lowered within the free carrier band on two frequency scales : a lower scale of the order of 500 @xmath4 shown by the spreading of the curves in figure  [ sumrule ] , and a higher one of the order of 5000 @xmath4 that is responsible for the temperature dependence below 10 000 @xmath4 in figure  [ difference ] .",
    "we also note here that the temperature dependence of the partial spectral weight shows no sign of any precursors to superconductivity at 67 k which is 8 k above the bulk superconducting transition temperature .",
    "the extended drude model offers a detailed view of the charge carrier scattering spectrum and its contribution to the effective mass  @xcite . in this picture the scattering rate in the drude expression is allowed to have a frequency dependence :    @xmath45 } \\nonumber\\\\   & = & i \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{4 \\pi } \\frac{1}{\\omega-2\\sigma^{op}(\\omega , t)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the plasma frequency , @xmath47 is the scattering rate and @xmath48 , @xmath49 is an effective mass and @xmath32 the bare mass .",
    "we also introduce the optical self energy @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the optical self energy is , apart from a @xmath53 factor , where @xmath54 is a scattering angle , an average over the fermi surface of the quasiparticle self - energy@xcite as measured by arpes .",
    "contrary to expectations , in optimally doped bi-2212 where both optical and arpes data exist , the self - energies derived from the two spectroscopies@xcite are surprisingly similar to one another  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ tau ] shows the scattering rate calculated from the extended drude model where @xmath55 for ortho ii y123 .",
    "we also evaluate the real part of the optical self - energy , which is given by : @xmath56 and is shown in figure  [ selfenergy ] . for the calculation of the optical self - energy and the scattering rate",
    "we need a value for the plasma frequency which includes spectral weight up to the interband transitions . using a procedure adopted in a previous study  @xcite we find a plasma frequency @xmath57=15 110 @xmath4 .    in fig .",
    "[ tau ] we see an overall increase in scattering both with temperature and frequency .",
    "the frequency dependence is monotonic with two thresholds , shown with arrows , where the scattering rate undergoes a step - like increase , a prominent low frequency one at 400 @xmath4 and a weaker , higher frequency one at 850 @xmath4 .",
    "the variation of the scattering rate with temperature is roughly linear at low frequency , but becomes much weaker at high frequency above the high frequency threshold .",
    "the scattering rate is larger than the frequency at all temperatures except at 28 k in the superconducting state , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath58 .    fig .",
    "[ taus ] shows the _ effective _ optical scattering rate defined as : @xmath59 one advantage of this quantity is that to calculate it the plasma frequency is not needed .",
    "this quantity is also more linear with frequency than the optical scattering rate  @xcite .        in fig .",
    "[ selfenergy ] we show the real part of the optical self - energy .",
    "it is related by kramers - kronig transformations to the scattering rate shown in fig .",
    "the separation of the two components of scattering is less obvious in this plot but in analogy with the bi-2212 system where we have investigated the detailed doping dependent data on this quantity  @xcite , we find that the bosonic mode gives rise to a peak on top of a broader background",
    ". with increased underdoping in bi-2212 the peak becomes triangular and harder to resolve from the background and is very similar in appearance to the ortho ii y123 data shown here .",
    "we can attempt to resolve the peak by focusing on the break in slope that occurs between 1000 @xmath4 and 1400 @xmath4 in the temperature range from 28 k to 171 k. above 200 k the break in slope can not be resolved .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ selfenergy ] shows a plot of the slopes of two straight dashed lines that have been fitted to the experimental data above and below the break frequency .",
    "we find that a plot of the two slopes shows that they cross at 155 k , _",
    "i.e. _ the second derivative of the optical self - energy goes through zero at this temperature .",
    "this is shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ selfenergy ]    recent calculations  @xcite of the self - energy of the charge carriers interacting with collective spin excitations suggest that the self - energy acquires an s - shaped frequency dependence in the presence of a sharp mode , whereas in the absence of such a mode the curve has a monotonically negative second derivative . from these observations",
    "we conclude , as a first approximation , that the bosonic mode is confined to temperatures below 155 k.    , which is calculated by using the eq .",
    "we observe two peaks : one is temperature dependent at lower frequency and the other is temperature independent at higher frequency . in the superconducting state there is a large shift of the low energy peak and a dramatic overshoot of the scattering rate giving rise to a negative contribution to the eliashberg function.,width=336 ]    for another estimate of the strength of the interaction of the charge carriers with the sharp mode we used the procedure introduced by marsiglio _",

    "we see that the intensity of this feature decreases linearly with temperature going to zero at @xmath17 200 k. on the same graph we have plotted the area under the neutron resonance and it is clear that the two phenomena have parallel temperature dependencies .",
    "we note that the spectral weight of the s1 peak , 8000 @xmath20 represents only 0.006 % of the total free carrier spectral weight , 1.25x10@xmath65 @xmath20",
    ".     90 k.,width=336 ]    we note that to obtain a finite frequency absorption peak such as the peak s1 , we need to break translational symmetry of the charge carriers",
    ". we can rule out phonon absorption which would be inconsistent with the large spectral weight of the peak s1 and the fact the spectral weight is temperature dependent as shown in fig  [ s1mode ] .",
    "there are a number of possible candidate mechanisms but we would like to focus on the static charge - density patterns seen by scanning probe microscopy in bi-2212  @xcite .",
    "models for optical absorption by strip - like patterns have been described by benfatto and morais smith  @xcite .",
    "the model describes the optical absorption by charges confined by a static pinning potential with two parameters , the strength of the potential and the modulation amplitude .",
    "finally , we show the calculated dc resistivity extracted from the extrapolated zero frequency limit of the optical conductivity .",
    "figure  [ dcresist ] shows the resulting dc resistivity for the eight normal state temperatures .",
    "the resistivity shows the familiar linear temperature dependence with an intercept on the temperature axis of 90 k , typical of underdoped samples of high @xmath3 cuprates .",
    "a more detailed comparison shows some discrepancies with the best dc transport data  @xcite .",
    "first , our absolute value of the resistivity at 300 k is 0.7 ( m@xmath66cm)@xmath67 while ando _ et al . _",
    "find , at the same doping level , a resistivity of 1.0 ( m@xmath66cm)@xmath67 .",
    "the second difference is the value of the resistivity in the low temperature plateau region just above @xmath3 where ando _",
    "measure a residual resistivity of about 200 ( @xmath68cm)@xmath67 whereas our extrapolation yields less than 50 ( @xmath68cm)@xmath67 .",
    "we think this difference may originate in the more ordered chain layer in our samples which were annealed whereas the sample of ando _ et al . _",
    "were quenched and presumably more disordered .",
    "the lower absolute value of the 300 k resistivity is harder to understand since we do nt expect inelastic scattering , a mechanism responsible for the high temperature resistivity , to depend on disorder .",
    "one often suspects contact geometry in dc transport but as ando _",
    "et al . _ have shown , errors from those sources amount to at most a few percent in their data . where the two data sets are in good agreement is the value of @xmath17 90 k for the intercept on the temperature axis .",
    "we now turn to a general interpretation of our data in terms of models proposed for the electrodynamics of cuprates focusing our attention on the low frequency spectral region below the free carrier plasma edge @xmath17 10 000 @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear from even the most superficial view of the data that the optical properties shown here are not those of a set of free carrier interacting weakly with impurities through elastic scattering or with lattice vibrations through inelastic scattering .",
    "two approaches have been used to account for these deviations , the one and the two component models of conductivity . in the one component model",
    "any deviation from the simple drude formula are attributed to a single set of charge carriers interacting with a variety of bosonic excitations while in the two component model a low frequency drude component is separated by curve fitting and any remaining absorption is attributed to a mid - infrared band .",
    "there is ample evidence that many conducting oxides do have a separate well - defined mid - infrared band with a peak frequency that moves to lower frequencies with doping  @xcite .",
    "this is also true of the one - layer cuprates , in particular la@xmath69sr@xmath70cuo@xmath71  @xcite . in some materials ,",
    "when the peak reaches zero frequency , striking changes occur in the transport properties , for example , ba@xmath72k@xmath70bio@xmath73 becomes superconducting at this doping level  @xcite .",
    "recent evidence from thermal conductivity suggests that la@xmath69sr@xmath70cuo@xmath71 becomes an insulator below a doping level of 0.06 where superconductivity also sets in whereas y123 remains in the conducting pseudogap state well below the doping level  @xcite of the superconductivity boundary .",
    "these observations suggest that the one - component to two - component transition occurs at different doping levels for these two materials and that the y123 system remains metallic to the lowest doping levels .",
    "we conclude that , at least at the level of doping of ortho - ii y123 , we are justified in using the one - component model .",
    "the striking result of the one - component model is the strong frequency dependent scattering rate @xmath47 shown in fig  [ tau ] .",
    "there is a nearly perfect linear variation of scattering at high frequency with a strong threshold at 400 @xmath4 at low temperatures that gradually washes with increasing temperature .",
    "we will interpret our spectra within the one - component model in terms of a scattering rate that is averaged over the brillouin zone and is the sum of two frequency dependent terms , a bosonic mode that dominates at low temperature but whose spectral weight weakens as the temperature rises and a featureless temperature independent background that extends to high frequencies .",
    "several theoretical models of strongly correlated system have been evoked to explain the strong linearly rising frequency dependent scattering rate .",
    "earlier models included the marginal fermi liquid@xcite , the nested fermi liquid models  @xcite , the nearly antiferromagentic liquid  @xcite , and the luttinger liquid model  @xcite .",
    "all models predict a continuous linear rise of scattering governed by an energy scale of the order of @xmath74 ev .",
    "the large energy scale rules out a simple phonon mechanism for the broad background scattering which would predict a flattening of the scattering rate beyond the maximum phonon frequency  @xcite .",

    "the depth of the pseudogap in the c - axis optical conductivity is more pronounced  @xcite but it is known that c - axis transport is weighted more heavily in the antinodal direction where the pseudogap is deeper whereas ab - plane transport is more evenly distributed in momentum space .",

    "[ a2f1 ] with the magnetic susceptibility @xmath99 determined by neutron scattering at 6 k ( @xmath100 ) by stock _",
    "( see inset in fig .",
    "[ a2f1 ] ) .",
    "the two sets of curves are very similar although it should be pointed out that our data are in the normal states and neutron data are in the superconducting state and that the _ width _ of our mode has been set equal to that of the neutron resonance mode .    comparing the relative amplitudes of the peak and the background , we find a substantial difference with the neutron data . for the ratio of the background to the peak amplitude our @xmath76 at 67 k gives @xmath30 0.17 while the neutron @xmath99 gives @xmath30 0.27 in the normal state ( we estimated the ratio in the normal state from the temperature dependent intensity of the neutron mode  @xcite ) .",
    "the relative amplitude of the peak in our spectra is 63 % stronger than what is seen by neutron scattering . in the absence of a more detailed calculation of the spectral function ,",
    "this discrepancy is not surprising since the coupling of the charge carriers to spin fluctuations involves integrations over the fermi surface and we are reporting only on weighted averages . on the other hand our data",
    "leaves open the possibility that the high frequency channel of conductivity , that is active in producing our background , is not well described by the mmp spin fluctuations .",
    "in addition to the relative amplitudes we can also compare the areas under the peak and background spectral functions . there is a sum rule for the area under @xmath99 which is related to our optical function @xmath76 by a coupling constant , @xmath101 .",
    "neutron scattering finds that the area under the spin resonance is about 3 % of the total area . in our case at 67 k",
    "this fraction is about 25 % , considerably larger .",
    "it can be argued that the coupling to the resonance @xmath101 could be larger than its background value by a factor of @xmath102 .",
    "this is reasonable since the resonance is around ( @xmath103,@xmath103 ) where the susceptibility is also expected to peak .     with the parameter shown in table  [ table1 ] and pseudogap information of fig  [ gapf ] for the normal states .",

    "[ a2f1 ] and pseudogap information of fig .",
    "[ gapf ] for the normal states .",
    "we note that the negative temperature dependence of the mode contribution combined with the almost equal and opposite contribution of the background results in a nearly temperature independent scattering rate at high frequencies , in complete agreement with the experimental results.,width=336 ]    .the parameters of the bosonic mode analysis at six representative temperatures , @xmath104 67 k , 100 k , 147 k , 200 k , 244 k , and 295 k. the peak is a gaussian function ( see eq .",
    "8) and mmp is the background ( see eq .",
    "the quantities @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the coupling constants for the peak and the mmp background , respectively .",
    "the depth , 1-@xmath105 , is the depth of the gap at fermi level in the density of state .",
    "all the frequencies are measured in @xmath4 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] we compare three quantities : the total area under the magnetic susceptibility in the 25 to 43 mev energy range from stock _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the area under the peak at 350 @xmath4 in the @xmath106 obtained from the second derivative of @xmath94 , and the area under the peak at 248 @xmath4 in the @xmath76 from our fit .",
    "we note that the two areas from the two different procedures for deriving @xmath76 show almost identical temperature dependencies .",
    "the area under the peak obtained from the magnetic susceptibility shows a temperature trend similar to those of the optical data .",
    "in analyzing the optical properties of ortho ii y123 we have adopted the one - component model of conductivity , attributing any deviations from the simple drude formula to inelastic processes .",
    "we find that the high frequency processes are well described by the mmp spectrum of spin fluctuations with a temperature dependence that originates in the bosonic occupation numbers , but a temperature _ independent _ spectral function , while at lower frequencies a strong temperature dependence sets in and the conductivity is well described by the extended drude model with a temperature _ dependent _ spectral function .",
    "the two methods we used to estimate the shape and temperature dependence of the bosonic spectrum gave very similar results . the main contribution to",
    "the spectral weight came from a prominent peak at 350 @xmath4 which was strongly temperature dependent in strength . from this temperature dependence",
    "we identified the mode with the neutron resonance which has a frequency of 248 @xmath4 .",
    "the 100 @xmath4 discrepancy we attributed to the effect of the pseudogap in the density of states which , as calculations suggest , has the effect of shifting upward the frequency of any bosonic mode . to fit the data , the strength of the mode had to be temperature dependent and the electronic density of states had to have a gap whose depth was also temperature dependent .",
    "these observations are in accord with what is known about the normal state of underdoped y123 from other experiments .",
    "the properties of the sharp bosonic resonance in the infrared scattering rate agree with the properties of the @xmath5 spin - flip neutron resonance mode .",
    "the frequency of the bosonic resonance 248 @xmath4 or 31 mev agrees with the frequency of the neutron mode measured by stock _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( provided the pseudogap is included in the model ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the strength of the mode also agrees with the neutron measurements on ortho ii y123 samples from the same source .",
    "the total spectral weight of the mode determined from least squares fits drops monotonically with temperature and reaches zero between 200 and 300 k , in agreement with the spectral weight of the neutron mode .",
    "fig  [ modemmp ] shows separately the two contributions to the scattering rate .",
    "we see that the combination of a sharp mode whose strength decreases with temperature and a temperature independent background solves a long standing problem in the optical conductivity of the cuprates : there is a strong temperature dependence at low frequencies but above 500 @xmath4 the scattering is nearly temperature independent . in the picture of mode and background , both caused by coupling to bosons , this high frequency behavior is the result of a competition between a rising absorption due to occupancy of the background boson population and a decrease in the strength of the bosonic mode with temperature .",
    "this scenario predicts an overall linear temperature dependence at all frequencies above the temperature where the sharp mode disappears .",
    "there is some evidence for this kind of behavior in the data for la@xmath69sr@xmath70cuo@xmath71 which does not have a magnetic resonance but shows a linear temperature dependence characteristic of bosons both in the dc resistivity  @xcite and optical scattering rate at high frequency  @xcite .      in summary",
    ", we have shown that two optical phenomena in ortho ii y123 have a close association with the magnetic resonance as measured for samples from the same source .",
    "the first is the onset of scattering associated with a bosonic resonance .",
    "this has been suggested by several previous investigators  @xcite , but here , for the first time we base our conclusions on experiments that use crystals with the same , well - defined doping level grown by the same technique .",
    "the second is the low - temperature conductivity peak that we have designated s1 .",
    "its connection to the magnetic resonance is not obvious since the magnetic resonance by itself is not optically active .",
    "one possible mechanism is the growth of in - plane coherence that takes place in this temperature region and has been suggested to be the closely related to the transverse plasma resonance that is seen in interplane conductivity  @xcite",
    ". the peak s1 may be such a resonance associated with in - plane charge density modulations either through pinning to defects  @xcite or through a transverse plasma resonance associated with the inhomogeneous charge density that seems to be present in underdoped cuprates in the normal state  @xcite .",

    "<S> the a - axis optical properties of a detwinned single crystal of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 in the ortho ii phase ( ortho ii y123 , @xmath3= 59 k ) were determined from reflectance data over a wide frequency range ( 70 - 42 000 @xmath4 ) for nine temperature values between 28 and 295 k. above 200 k the spectra are dominated by a broad background of scattering that extends to 1 ev . below 200 k a shoulder in </S>",
    "<S> the reflectance appears and signals the onset of scattering at 400 @xmath4 . in this temperature range </S>",
    "<S> we also observe a peak in the optical conductivity at 177 @xmath4 . below 59 k , the superconducting transition temperature , the spectra change dramatically with the appearance of the superconducting condensate . </S>",
    "<S> its spectral weight is consistent , to within experimental error , with the ferrell - glover - tinkham ( fgt ) sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our data with magnetic neutron scattering on samples from the same source that show a strong resonance at 31 mev . we find that the scattering rates can be modeled as the combined effect of the neutron resonance and a bosonic background in the presence of a density of states with a pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> the model shows that the decreasing amplitude of the neutron resonance with temperature is compensated for by an increasing of the bosonic background yielding a net temperature independent scattering rate at high frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> the complete phase diagram of the high temperature superconducting ( htsc ) cuprates is still under intense debate . </S>",
    "<S> the normal state , particularly in the underdoped region , is dominated by a variety of not - well - understood cross - over phenomena that may either be precursors to superconductivity or competing states . </S>",
    "<S> these include the pseudogap  @xcite , the magnetic resonance  @xcite , the anomalous nernst effect  @xcite , stripe order  @xcite and possible superconducting fluctuations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is further complicated by the presence of disorder and the practical considerations that lead to a situation where a given cuprate is not investigated with all the available experimental techniques . ideally , one would like to have a system where disorder is minimized and several experimental techniques can be used with the same crystals . as a step in that direction we present detailed a - axis optical data on the highly ordered ortho - ii phase of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ortho ii y123 ) and compare these data with recent results from magnetic neutron scattering and microwave spectroscopy on crystals from the same source .    </S>",
    "<S> an important motivation for a comparison between transport properties and the magnetic neutron resonance comes from the observation that the carrier life time , as measured by infrared spectroscopy , is dominated by a bosonic mode  @xcite whose frequency and intensity , as a function of temperature and doping level , tracks the inelastic magnetic resonance at 41 mev with in - plane momentum transfer of @xmath5  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic resonance has also been invoked to explain other self - energy effects such as the kink in the dispersion of angle - resolved photo emission spectra ( arpes )  @xcite and as a hump - peak structure in tunneling spectra  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these effects have also been attributed to the electron - phonon interaction  @xcite . while the bosonic excitation may not be the fundamental engine of superconductivity  @xcite , nevertheless it is important to map out the regions in the phase diagram where it can be found and correlate the various experiments that yield evidence of its presence .    </S>",
    "<S> the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath6 ( y123 ) material has been one of the most thoroughly studied of all the htsc systems but , like most cuprates , it suffers from disorder associated with the charge reservoir layer , in the case of y123 , disordered oxygen chains . </S>",
    "<S> however , at an oxygen doping level of @xmath7 , an ordered ortho - ii phase occurs with alternating full and empty cuo chains , doubling the unit cell along the a - direction , and yielding a well ordered stoichiometric compound  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a further advantage of this system is the availability of very large crystals , suitable for neutron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> a disadvantage of the y123 system is that the crystals are not easily vacuum - cleaved and as a result , surface sensitive probes such as angle resolved photoemission or scanning tunneling microscopy have been used less with y123 . in contrast </S>",
    "<S> bi@xmath0sr@xmath8cacu@xmath0o@xmath9 ( bi-2212 ) cleaves easily and unlike y123 , can also be overdoped . </S>",
    "<S> optical spectroscopy has the advantage of working on both systems equally well and offers a bridge between the arpes surface sensitive experiments and the large - volume probe of neutron scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we start with a brief introduction to the experimental method followed by a presentation of the raw reflectance data and an analysis where we use the extended drude model to extract the various optical constants , in particular the real and imaginary parts of the scattering rate . to improve the accuracy of the data , </S>",
    "<S> we first remove known features in the conductivity spectra such as the transverse optical phonons and the delta - function response of the superconducting condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the measured scattering rates are then compared with a theoretical model . </S>",
    "<S> we next discuss the overall results by comparing them with data from other experiments on ortho ii y123 , in particular recent neutron data@xcite on samples from the same source . </S>"
