    "one of the most fundamental features of quantum correlations is the nonlocal and the random character of microscopic single events .",
    "nonlocal randomness differs in a fundamental way from the randomness associated with the concept of local realism which is based on the assumption that microscopic physical systems can be described by local objective properties that are independent from observation .",
    "local realism versus the nonlocal character of quantum mechanics @xcite has been described best in the framework of spin-@xmath1 epr correlations @xcite .",
    "the classical limit of quantum nonlocality has been investigated in the framework of the generalized epr entangled correlations involving arbitrary spin-@xmath0 @xcite . in the limit of large spin these correlations",
    "should exhibit a smooth transition to the classical regime if the measurements do not resolve the quantum properties of the spin @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown by greenberger , horne and zeilinger ( ghz ) @xcite that special entangled states involving three or four particles lead to a much stronger refutation of local realism .",
    "it has been shown that in many - particle correlations only a _",
    "single _ set of observations is required in order to demolish the local reality assumption @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that the epr spin-@xmath0 correlations and that the three - particle ghz correlations can be visualized as nonlocal correlations between sequences of completely random numbers @xmath2 and @xmath3 corresponding to `` no '' and `` yes '' outcomes of the spin polarization analyzers .",
    "the coincidences between these random numbers are described by conditional probabilities which are nonlocal , i.e. , are dependent on the orientations of the spin analyzers .",
    "the nonlocality of these conditional probabilities makes the bell s inequality void , because for local realism the existence of a universal , polarization independent transition probability between the random sequences is essential .    a description that exhibits the relation between the randomness and the nonlocality of entangled quantum states is well suited to study the epr and the ghz correlations using the gibbs - shannon entropy . for a system involving two of three correlated subsystems",
    ", the information entropy can offer a measure of quantum correlation if the informations of the subsystems are compared with the total information of the composed system .",
    "the nonlocal character of the epr and the ghz correlations of the subsystems will be tested using the information bell s inequalities involving entropies of the probabilities that can be determined from the statistics of random `` yes '' and `` no '' answers .",
    "in such a framework the relations between the randomness , the nonlocality and the entropic information for the epr and the ghz correlations will be established .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii general properties of the epr correlations for arbitrary spin-@xmath0 are reviewed and the randomness and the nonlocality of these correlations are discussed in the framework of the quantum bivalued distribution functions . the randomness and the information of these epr correlations is than discussed in the framework of the information entropy . the information bell s inequality for the epr correlations involving arbitrary spin-@xmath0 is investigated . in sec .",

    "the epr entangled state of the two particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 , each with spin @xmath0 is given by the following singlet state of the two spins :    @xmath6 correspond to the eigenvalues of the @xmath7-components of the two spins . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the joint spin transmission probability of detection of such a entangled state by two linear polarizers , is defined by the following formula :    @xmath8    in this expression @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the spin projection operators of the particles @xmath4 and @xmath11 along the polarization directions @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    following the basic ideas of a theory based on local reality ,",
    "the transmissions of an arbitrary spin-@xmath0 through the linear polarizers @xmath14 and @xmath15 are described by objective realities represented by normalized transmission functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with hidden variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in a theory based on local hidden variables ( lhv ) , these transmission functions are local realities that are averaged over the hidden variables during a detection process . in the framework of such lhv theories the joint spin transmission is given by the following statistical average of local realities : @xmath20 where the hidden parameters are randomly distributed with a positive normalized distribution function :    @xmath21    this distribution function is local i.e. , it is independent on the polarization directions @xmath12 and @xmath15 .",
    "for such a local distribution of random variables , the lhv transmission probability ( [ lhv ] ) evaluated for four different polarization axes @xmath22 is restricted by the bell s inequality @xcite :    @xmath23    the original bell s inequalities have been derived only for spin-@xmath1 , but it has been shown that the inequality in the form ( [ bell1 ] ) is valid for correlations involving an arbitrary spin-@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we begin the discussion of the randomness and the nonlocality in quantum mechanics using the two - point distribution that has been introduced and applied to the discussion of quantum jumps in optical transitions @xcite . using the spectral decomposition of the spin projector operator : @xmath24",
    "we rewrite the quantum mechanical joint - probability ( [ qpro1 ] ) in the following form : @xmath25 where the distribution function is given by the following quantum mechanical average : @xmath26 the projection operators @xmath27 corresponding to the two orientations of the linear polarizers @xmath28 and @xmath15 are obtained by a rotation of the maximum `` down '' spin states @xmath29 and @xmath30 by angles @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the spin-@xmath0 ladder operators for the particle @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    with the help of the distribution function ( [ nonlocp1 ] )",
    "we have rewritten the quantum mechanical joint probability function ( [ qpro1 ] ) in a form given by ( [ clickp1 ] ) which has remarkable similarities to the lhv correlation function given by ( [ lhv ] ) . because the projection operators can have their eigenvalues equal to 1 or 0 , i.e. , can represent only `` yes '' or `` no '' answers , the values @xmath18 and @xmath19 can take only values equal to 1 and 0 corresponding to `` clicks '' at the detectors .",
    "the bivalued distribution given by ( [ nonlocp1 ] ) is positive everywhere , but depends on the polarization directions @xmath12 and @xmath15 .",
    "the distribution function which depends on the orientation @xmath12 of the first analyzer and on the orientation @xmath15 of the second ( possibly even remote ) analyzer is nonlocal . in the framework of epr correlations , it is customary to call an analyzer - dependent distribution function a nonlocal distribution function .",
    "the nonlocality of this distribution function makes the bell s inequality ( [ bell1 ] ) void , because in order to obtain this inequality the existence of a universal , local ( polarization independent ) distribution in the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( hidden parameters in this case ) is essential .    from quantum mechanics we obtain that epr correlations can be described by a distribution function of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ nonlocp1 ] ) with the condition that the statistical distribution of the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 is nonlocal i.e. , is dependent on the polarization direction .    in order to elucidate the statistical and the random character of the nonlocal distribution function further",
    ", we shall perform a bayesian analysis of the joint correlation .",
    "the joint distribution can be written in the following form :    @xmath36    the distribution @xmath37 is the conditional of the event @xmath18 ( `` yes '' or `` no '' ) to occur under the condition that @xmath19 ( `` yes '' or `` no '' ) has occurred and @xmath38 is the marginal of the joint distribution . in the following , for notational convenience , we will omit the polarization directions and denote these functions by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where the indexes @xmath41 and @xmath42 will denote @xmath43 and @xmath44 for a `` yes '' or a `` no '' outcome , respectively . from the properties of the epr entangled state ( [ psi1 ] ) and the definitions of the projection operators ( [ projection ] ) it is easy to calculate all of these distribution functions .",

    "we obtain that the joint spin transmission function is : @xmath50    from the bayes analysis ( [ bayes1 ] ) we have the following sum rules fulfilled by the conditional probabilities : @xmath51 this result shows that one can regard the epr correlations as correlations of two sequences of random numbers represented by transmission functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 that are jumping between values 0 and 1 ( `` no '' and `` yes '' answers ) for measurements performed with linear analyzers . these are the only possible outcomes of the transmission experiment .",
    "this positive and nonlocal distribution leads to a simple statistical interpretation of the spin correlations and of the violation of bell s inequality in terms of random numbers 1 and 0 for the transmission functions . on each single polarizer ,",
    "the outcomes are completely random and the `` yes '' and `` no '' answers occur with probabilities @xmath54 for `` no '' and @xmath55 for `` yes '' .",
    "the nonlocality of the epr correlations shows up in the fact that these two perfectly random sequences ( on the first and the second polarizers ) are correlated and the correlations are given by eq .",

    "these formulas predict that the epr entanglement can be understood as a nonlocal correlation between the two random sequences @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 ) .",
    "the nonlocality of these correlations follows from the fact that whenever @xmath58 on the polarizer @xmath11 , we must have @xmath59 or 0 on the polarizer @xmath60 with the probabilities @xmath61 and @xmath62 , i.e. , the outcomes on @xmath60 ( possibly even a remote analyzer ) are determined by the outcomes on the analyzer @xmath11 .",
    "this is how the epr quantum sequences of random numbers violate local realism . only for @xmath63 and @xmath64",

    "this is precisely what we can expect from the entangled correlations in the classical limit corresponding in this case to @xmath70 . in this limit",
    "the quantum nonlocal distribution becomes a local probability distribution corresponding to sharp `` yes '' and `` no '' outcomes of the measurement involving classical antiparallel angular momenta . in quantum mechanic terms , in this limit the quantum amplitudes become classical probabilities for a classical spining top @xcite .      we have shown that the outcomes of the epr correlations can be visualized as nonlocal correlations between completely random sequences of random numbers @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "the joint or the conditional probabilities for these random sequences reflect what we know about the correlated system .",
    "this knowledge called information , can be described by the gibbs - shannon information - entropy h ( in bits ) . from the definition of joint and marginal distribution functions",
    "we can construct the following information entropies for the epr correlations    @xmath75    and its marginals :    @xmath76    in the same way we introduce a conditional information entropy by the following definition @xmath77 from the bayes s theorem ( [ bayes1 ] ) relating a conditional probability with a joint probability we obtain that @xmath78 from the properties of the joint and the conditional probabilities follow the following inequality : @xmath79 this inequality has a simple interpretation that removing a condition never decreases the information carried by the system .    for a system involving two correlated subsystems the entropy can offer a measure of quantum correlation if the information each of the subsystems is compared with the total information of the composite system .",
    "a very important property of the information - entropy is its subadditivity .",

    "let us make some remarks about the monotonicity of entropy .",
    "neither quantum - mechanically nor in classical physics is it true that @xmath81 .",
