    "elliptic billiards are at the same time classical and popular subject ( see , for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) since they continue to deliver interesting problems .",
    "we will consider an ellipse and a billiard in it with the standard reflection law : the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection .",
    "let the trajectory from a point on the boundary repeat itself after two reflections : this means that we obtained a triangle which presents a 3-periodic trajectory of the ball in the elliptic billiard .",
    "poncelet s famous theorem @xcite states that the sides of these triangles are tangent to some smaller ellipse confocal to the initial one .",
    "we prove the following fact which was observed experimentally by dan reznik @xcite :    [ 1 ] for every elliptic billiard the set of incenters ( the centers of the inscribed circles ) of its triangular orbits is an ellipse .",
    "the proof uses very classical ideas : complexify and projectivize , that is , replace the euclidean plane by the complex projective plane .",
    "this approach was used by ph .",
    "griffiths and j. harris in @xcite and , more recently , by r. schwartz in @xcite .",
    "the main tool in the proof is that of complex reflection : we consider an ellipse as a complex curve and define a complex law of reflection off a complex curve .",
    "the locus of the incenters will be also a complex algebraic ( even rational ) curve .",
    "we will prove that the latter curve is a conic in @xmath1 .",
    "its real part will be a bounded conic  an ellipse .",
    "the reasons for developping complex methods for the solution of a problem in planimetry are twofold : first of all , such an approach shows that sometimes complexification paradoxically simplifies things .",
    "we think that complex methods could be a useful tool in obtaining many results of this kind .",
    "ideologically , this work is related with the recent work by a. glutsyuk where he studies complex reflection , see for example @xcite an the joint work with yu .",
    "kudryashov @xcite .",
    "the second reason to develop the complex approach for this particular problem was the incompetence of the author to prove this fact with real tools besides computation .",
    "the reader is encouraged to find an alternative proof of the theorem [ 1 ] .",
    "complex reflection law and its basic properties needed here are reviewed in section [ 2 ] .",
    "section [ 3 ] contains the proof of theorem [ 1 ] . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we discuss the position of the foci of an obtained ellipse .",
    "for our purposes it will be useful to pass from the euclidean plane @xmath2 to the complex projective plane @xmath1 : the metric now is replaced , in local complex coordinates @xmath3 , by a quadratic form @xmath4 . in the following",
    "we will be interested in the geometry of this new space @xmath1 with quadratic form @xmath5 .",
    "one could have replaced the initial euclidean metric by a pseudo - euclidean one : the geometry of such a space is also interesting and somewhat similar to our case .",
    "the best references here will be @xcite and @xcite .    the lines with directing vectors that have zero length are called",
    "all other lines are called _ non - isotropic_.    let us fix a point @xmath6 and define complex symmetry with respect to a line passing through @xmath7 as a map acting on the space @xmath8 of all lines passing through @xmath7 .",
    "there are two isotropic lines @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath8 with directing vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    [ crl ] for a point @xmath13 , the _",
    "complex reflection ( symmetry ) _ in a non - isotropic line @xmath14 is the mapping given by the same formula as in the case of standard real symmetry : it s a linear map that in the coordinates defined by the line @xmath15 and its orthogonal line @xmath16 has a diagonal matrix @xmath17    the image of any line @xmath18 under reflection in an isotropic line @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) is defined as a limit of its images under reflections with respect to a sequence of non - isotropic lines converging to @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) .",
    "moreover , the complex reflection in a curve is the reflection in its tangent line .    [ 111 ]    * the complex symmetry with respect to any isotropic line @xmath18 at some point @xmath19 is well defined for all non - isotropic lines ( i.e. the latter limit of the images of a sequence of non - isotropic lines exists ) and maps every non - isotropic line @xmath20 to @xmath18 .",
    "* under the reflection at the point @xmath7 with respect to some isotropic line @xmath21 , the line @xmath18 itself may be mapped to any line passing through @xmath7 ( i.e. the mapping in this case is multivalued ) . in particular , it can stay fixed .",
    "the isotropic directions generated by the vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be represented by the points @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "we choose an affine coordinate @xmath26 on the projective line @xmath27 at infinity , that is , the line through points @xmath28 and @xmath29 in such a way that @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the lemma below implies theorem [ 111 ] and follows easily from the definition .",
    "it describes the reflection in a line close to isotropic .    [ 11 ] for any @xmath32 , let @xmath33 be the line through the origin @xmath34 and having direction @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 be the reflection in @xmath33 acting on the space @xmath37 of the lines through the origin .",
    "then @xmath38 in the above introduced coordinate @xmath26 .",
    "the map @xmath39 is a projective transformation that preserves @xmath33 as well as the set of isotropic lines .",
    "so @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "let us show that @xmath39 permutes @xmath42 and @xmath43 . otherwise , it would have three fixed points on the infinity line @xmath44 and therefore be identity map of the infinity line .",
    "moreover , the points lying on @xmath33 are fixed for @xmath39 . in this case",
    "@xmath39 should be identity but it s a nontrivial involution , contradiction .",
    "we see that the restriction of @xmath39 is a nontrivial conformal involution of @xmath45 fixing @xmath35 and permuting @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "so it should map @xmath26 to @xmath46 .",
    "let us consider triangular orbits of the complexified elliptic billiard : the triangles inscribed into a complexified ellipse and satisfying the complex reflection law .",
    "denote the initial ellipse from theorem [ 1 ] by @xmath47 , and the poncelet ellipse tangent to all triangular orbits by @xmath48 .",
    "we use the same symbols for complexifications of these conics .",
    "the following classical fact will be used for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and for the inscribed circles .",
    "[ 12 ]    * ellipses @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the real plane are confocal if and only if their complexifications have @xmath49 common isotropic tangent lines and their common foci lie on the intersections of these lines . *",
    "the two tangent lines to the complexified circle passing through its center are isotropic .",
    "a _ side _ of a triangle in @xmath1 with disctinct vertices is a complex line through a pair of its vertices .",
    "a triangle is called _ degenerate _ if all its vertices lie on the same line . a priori , a triangular orbit may have coinciding vertices .",
    "we will call @xmath50 _ the degenerate side _ through two coinciding vertices if @xmath50 is obtained as a limit of sides @xmath51 of non - degenerate triangular orbits .",
    "for such a side @xmath50 _ its image _ under reflection is defined as a limit ( which exists as the limit in definition [ crl ] ) of images of @xmath52 .    by taking a family @xmath52 of lines tangent to @xmath48 and converging to @xmath50 , and computing their images ( in fact , applying lemma [ 5 ] below )",
    ", one could deduce the structure of degenerate triangular orbits formulated in lemma [ lemma ] .",
    "[ 5 ] let @xmath50 be a common isotropic tangent line to two analytic ( algebraic ) curves @xmath48 and @xmath47 and let the tangency points be quadratic and distinct . if @xmath50 is deformed in a family @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) of lines tangent to @xmath48 then the image of @xmath52 under the reflection in @xmath47 tends to some non - isotropic line as @xmath54 .",
    "the more general case of this lemma is contained in @xcite , see proposition @xmath55 and addendum @xmath56 there .    the isotropic line @xmath50 is deformed in a family @xmath52 :",
    "let us suppose that the family is chosen in such a way that the angle between @xmath50 and @xmath52 is precisely @xmath35 .",
    "suppose that @xmath52 intersects @xmath47 in some point @xmath57 tending to the point @xmath58 of isotropic tangency .",
    "the simple computation shows that since the tangency points are quadratic , the tangent line @xmath59 to @xmath47 at the point @xmath57 has the angle of the order @xmath60 with @xmath50 .",
    "this with lemma [ 11 ] gives that the limit of the reflected lines is a non - isotropic one .",
    "now we can describe the degenerate triangles occuring in our problem .",
    "[ lemma ] if a triangular orbit in the complexified ellipse @xmath47 is degenerate then it has two coinciding non - isotropic non - degenerate sides @xmath61 and one degenerate isotropic side @xmath50 .    since @xmath62",
    ", two vertices should merge , so the degenerate side @xmath50 through them is tangent to @xmath47 and to @xmath48 , and hence is isotropic by lemma [ 12 ] .",
    "the other two sides are non - isotropic by lemma [ 5 ] and they coincide .    [ main ] the complex curve of incenters @xmath63 intersects the complex line @xmath64 through the foci of @xmath47 at exactly two points with index  @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 and suppose that the corresponding triangle is degenerate , see figure [ picdegenerate ] .",
    "by lemma [ lemma ] one of its sides is isotropic , and two other sides coincide and are non - isotropic .",
    "we will denote the isotropic line as @xmath50 and non  isotropic line as @xmath61 .",
    "line @xmath50 is tangent to the inscribed circle , so by lemma [ 12 ] , @xmath67 .",
    "also @xmath68 is a point of intersection of bisectors , so either @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath61 is tangent to the inscribed circle , hence if @xmath69 , then @xmath61 should be isotropic , which is a contradiction .",
    "so @xmath70 , but by lemma [ 12 ] @xmath68 is a focus .",
    "@xmath71 is tangent to @xmath47 and passes through the focus , so it should be isotropic which is impossible since @xmath61 is not isotropic .     and @xmath48 having four common isotropic tangent lines .",
    "the line @xmath64 of real foci passes through the intersections of isotropic lines . a degenerate trajectory for an elliptic billiard in @xmath47 with caustic @xmath48 : the degenerate triangle is an interval between points @xmath65 and @xmath56 and its sides are lines @xmath50 and @xmath61 .",
    "line @xmath50 is isotropic while @xmath61 is not.,height=230 ]    now consider the case of a not degenerate triangle corresponding to @xmath66 .",
    "consider the reflection in @xmath64 : the inscribed circle , as well as its center @xmath68 , are mapped to themselves .",
    "if the set of the sides of a triangle and their images under the reflection in @xmath64 consists of _ six _ lines , then the inscribed circle and the ellipse @xmath48 should be tangent to all of them . but five tangent lines already define a conic , so @xmath48 must be a circle .",
    "but in this case , theorem [ 1 ] is trivial and the locus under consideration is a point .",
    "therefore some sides of the triangle should map to some other sides .",
    "one needs to consider two cases : either there is a side which maps to itself , or there are two sides which map to each other .",
    "but the latter case reduces to the former : indeed , the points of intersection of the two exchanging lines with @xmath47 ( not lying on @xmath64 ) are mapped to each other , so the line connecting them is mapped to itself .",
    "therefore , in the non - degenerate case , the corresponding triangle has a side which is symmetric with respect to @xmath64 and tangent to @xmath48 .",
    "there are only two such lines , and hence only two intersections @xmath72 and @xmath73 , both real ( see figure [ pic ] ) , and only two triangles corresponding to them , for each @xmath74 .",
    "corresponding to the centers @xmath75 of inscribed circles lying on the foci line @xmath64,height=230 ]    let us now prove that the intersections @xmath76 have index @xmath65 .",
    "let us parametrize an ellipse @xmath48 by a parameter @xmath35 , and consider the corresponding center @xmath77 , assuming that @xmath78 .",
    "it suffices to prove that @xmath79 .",
    "suppose the contrary : the centers of the circles do not change in the linear approximation : @xmath80 .",
    "then the radius of the incircle @xmath81 has nonzero derivative at @xmath82 , unless for @xmath82 both the incircle and the ellipse @xmath48 are tangent to the sides of the triangle at the same points .",
    "this is impossible if @xmath48 is not a circle , since two distinct conics can not be tangent at more than two distinct points .",
    "so we have that the radii of the incircles change linearly : @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "but this is not possible due to symmetry : indeed , the radius has to be an even function of @xmath35 .",
    "theorem [ 1 ] follows directly from the lemma [ main ] since an algebraic curve intersecting some line in exactly two points ( with multiplicities ) is a conic .",
    "one could surmise that the ellipse @xmath63 that is obtained in theorem [ 1 ] is confocal to the initial one .",
    "it appears that it is not so .",
    "picture [ focipic ] shows how the foci of the ellipse @xmath63 move regarding the foci of the ellipse @xmath47 .",
    "we suppose that the ratio between the semi - axis of the initial ellipse @xmath47 is @xmath85 .",
    "the upper graph on figure [ focipic ] is a graph of the distance from the center of @xmath47 to its foci : just the arc of the circle @xmath86 .",
    "the lower graph is a graph of analogous ( quite complicated ) function for the ellipse @xmath63 .",
    "this graph was obtained by pure computation .",
