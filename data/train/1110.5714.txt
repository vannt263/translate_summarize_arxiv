    "the total reaction cross section @xmath3  is related to the complex scattering matrix @xmath4 by the well - known relation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the wave number , @xmath7 is the energy in the center - of - mass ( c.m . )  system , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the real reflexion coefficients and scattering phase shifts .",
    "@xmath10 is the contribution of the @xmath11-th partial wave to the total reaction cross section @xmath3 .",
    "usually , experimental elastic scattering angular distributions are analyzed using a complex optical potential . at first view",
    ", it seems to be a simple task firstly to determine @xmath3  from the analysis of the elastic scattering angular distribution and secondly to distribute this cross section @xmath3  among the open channels ( e.g.  using the statistical model ) to predict cross sections of @xmath1-induced reactions .",
    "however , in practice several problems appear .",
    "there is no unambiguous way to determine reflexion coeffcients @xmath8 , phase shifts @xmath9 , or the optical potential from a measured elastic scattering angular distribution , and , in addition , in most cases angular distributions are measured at relatively high energies whereas reaction cross sections should also be known at low energies below the coulomb barrier ( this holds in particular for reaction cross sections relevant for nuclear astrophysics ) .",
    "thus , typically an ambiguous optical potential has to be extrapolated down to low energies ; as a consequence , considerable uncertainties have been noticed for the prediction of @xmath1-induced reaction cross sections at low energies , in particular for ( @xmath1,@xmath12 )  capture reactions for targets with masses above @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "very recently , sauerwein _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied the @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  reaction at energies between 10 and 15mev , i.e.  below the coulomb barrier .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the calculated @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  cross section depends almost exclusively on the @xmath1  transmission and is thus well - suited to test global @xmath1-nucleus optical potentials .",
    "it is found that the new experimental data can not be reproduced by any of the widely used global @xmath1-nucleus potentials which are the energy - independent 4-parameter mcfadden / satchler ( mcf ) potential @xcite , the latest version of the avrigeanu ( avr ) potential with many partly energy - dependent parameters @xcite , and the energy - independent 6-parameter potential by frhlich and rauscher ( frr ) which is optimized for low - energy reaction cross sections @xcite .",
    "however , an excellent description of the new @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  data is achieved in @xcite using an energy - dependent modification of the mcf potential where a new energy dependence of the depth of the imaginary woods - saxon volume potential was introduced to reproduce the new reaction data ; the potential by sauerwein _",
    "et al . _",
    "is referred to as sauerwein / rauscher ( short `` sar '' ) in the following .",
    "contrary to the study in @xcite which is restricted to the analysis of the @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  reaction in a narrow energy window , the present study considers @xmath0pr(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0pr  elastic scattering in a wide energy range from 19 to 45mev . from the fits to the elastic scattering angular distributions a new energy - dependent potential is derived , and the total reaction cross section @xmath3  is calculated from this potential .",
    "is then compared to all in the exfor data base @xcite available @xmath1-induced reaction data on @xmath0pr .",
    "the aim of the present study is thus a consistent description of all available elastic scattering and reaction data over a broad energy range .",
    "elastic @xmath0pr(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0pr  scattering data are available in literature at 45mev @xcite .",
    "however , these data cover only a limited angular range , and they have to be digitized from fig .  3 in @xcite .",
    "the latter leads to uncertainties which are difficult to estimate .",
    "four @xmath0pr(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0pr  angular distributions at @xmath14 = 19.0 , 23.97 , 32.0 , and 37.7mev have been measured by @xcite .",
    "the experiment has been performed at the xtu tandem of the infn laboratori nazionali di legnaro .",
    "unfortunately , these data have never been published ; a partial analysis of the data was already shown in an earlier publication @xcite .",
    "these data are available in numerical form ( including uncertainties ) and are thus much better suited for the determination of an optical potential by a fitting procedure . however , as the original data give statistical errors only ( with tiny uncertainties at forward angles ) , a 5% uncertainty has been added quadratically to account for unknown systematic errors of the data . note",
    "that it is difficult to achieve much smaller systematic uncertainties for @xmath1-scattering experiments ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these data will be made available to the community via exfor @xcite .    besides the @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  data of @xcite , the reactions @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  and @xmath0pr(@xmath1,2n)@xmath15pm  have been measured in @xcite using a stacked - foil activation technique .",
    "the data cover an energy range from about 15 to 45mev .",
    "although this technique leads to considerable uncertainties at low energies , these data provide further insight into the energy dependence of reaction cross sections and the distribution of the total reaction cross section @xmath3  among different open channels .",
    "unfortunately , data for @xmath0pr(@xmath1,@xmath12)@xmath16pm  are not available in @xcite , and because of its lower reaction cross section and unfavorable half - life and decay branches of @xmath16pm it was not possible to measure the @xmath0pr(@xmath1,@xmath12)@xmath16pm  cross section simultaneously with the @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  cross section in the recent high - sensitivity activation experiment of @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath0pr(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0pr  angular distributions follows closely the procedure outlined in earlier work @xcite .",
    "the total potential is composed of the nuclear potential with a real and an imaginary part and the real coulomb potential .",
    "the different potentials are discussed in the following .",
    "the real part of the nuclear potential is derived from the folding model ; the folding potential is modified by a strength parameter @xmath17 and a width parameter @xmath18 .",
    "( large deviations from @xmath19 would indicate a failure of the folding model . ) to avoid discrete uncertainties from the so - called `` family problem '' real potentials with volume integrals of about @xmath20mev@xmath21 have been selected @xcite .",
    "( note that the negative signs of volume integrals @xmath22 and @xmath23 are  as usual  omitted in the discussion . )    the imaginary part of the nuclear potential is taken in the usual woods - saxon parametrization .",
    "it is well - known that scattering data at low energies are best described using an imaginary potential of woods - saxon surface type ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this has been confirmed recently in a microscopic calculation of the @xmath1-nucleus potential @xcite .",
    "the same behavior is found in the present study where the angular distributions at @xmath14 = 19.0 , 23.97 , and 32.0mev can be very well reproduced with a pure surface imaginary potential .",
    "an additional volume woods - saxon potential in the imaginary part does not improve the description of the angular distributions at low energies .",
    "however , for an excellent description of the 37.7 and 45.0mev data a combination of volume and surface woods - saxon potentials for the imaginary part is required ; at these energies the volume part is even dominating the imaginary potential .",
    "the coulomb potential is taken in the usual parametrization of a homogenously charged sphere with a coulomb radius @xmath24 identical to the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius of the folding potential without width modification ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this avoids uncertainties from the otherwise somewhat arbitrary choice of the coulomb radius @xmath24 ( often taken as @xmath26 , 1.3 , or 1.4fm @xmath27 ) which are non - negligible at least at very low energies @xcite .",
    "the resulting parameters of the potential and the total reaction cross section @xmath3  are listed in table [ tab : pot ] .",
    "the fits are compared to the experimental angular distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : scat ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,>,<,^ \" , ]     the excellent reproduction of @xmath3  for most global potentials at energies above the coulomb barrier can be explained by a look at the reflexion coefficients @xmath8 and the contribution @xmath10 of the @xmath11-th partial wave to @xmath3  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_reac - e24 ] for the example of the @xmath28mev data ) . for small angular momenta",
    "@xmath11 the reflexion coefficients are close to @xmath29 ; thus , @xmath10 increases linearly proportional to @xmath30 ( dashed line in fig .  [ fig : eta_reac - e24 ] ) .",
    "all global potentials with a reasonable real part and a sufficiently strong imaginary part , i.e.  the mcf , avr , and sar potentials , predict the same @xmath10 for small @xmath11 . for large @xmath11 ( corresponding to large impact parameters ) the @xmath8 approach unity , and the @xmath10 vanish ( i.e. , partial waves with large angular momenta are practically not absorbed by any imaginary potential with a limited radial range ) .",
    "differences in @xmath10 appear only for a few partial waves between @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( for the @xmath28mev case ) where the different potentials predict different @xmath8 and thus different @xmath10 .",
    "it becomes obvious that relatively small differences in @xmath8 for a very limited number of partial waves around @xmath33 can not lead to major differences for the total reaction cross section @xmath3  which is simply given by the sum over all @xmath10 .",
    "the good reproduction of the total reaction cross section @xmath3  from different global potentials is thus simply a consequence of intrinsic properties of the scattering matrix as long as the energy exceeds the coulomb barrier .",
    "the situation changes dramatically at lower energies far below the coulomb barrier . here only the lowest angular momenta ( below @xmath34 ) are affected , show @xmath35 , and thus contribute to @xmath10 ; but even these @xmath8 remain much larger than zero and do even approach @xmath36 for very low energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_reac - low ] for energies @xmath37 , i.e.  the energy range of the new @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  data of @xcite ) . here",
    "the trivial @xmath30 proportionality of the @xmath10 vanishes .",
    "now the relevant @xmath10 depend sensitively on details of the potential .",
    "in particular , the strength of the imaginary part for large radii has strong impact on the resulting cross sections @xmath10 . under these conditions",
    "it becomes mandatory that the imaginary potential has the proper geometry ( e.g.  fixed from scattering data at slightly higher energies ) and the proper strength ( using a realistic energy dependence , e.g.  from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fermi ] ) , which can be adjusted to scattering data and/or properly chosen reaction data ) . as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec : scat ] , the real part of the potential has only minor uncertainties in shape and strength because it is calculated from a folding procedure ; furthermore , the analysis of @xmath1-decay properties provides a test for the @xmath38 potential ( see sect .  [ sec : decay ] ) .",
    "the above discussion explains why all global potentials are able to reproduce total reaction cross sections @xmath3  above the coulomb barrier , but may fail to reproduce @xmath3  below the coulomb barrier .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the global potentials show a significant scatter in the predictions of the new experimental @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  data of @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sfact ] ) .    for the energy - independent mcf potential",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is obvious .",
    "the missing energy dependence of the mcf potential leads to an overestimation of the imaginary part of the potential at low energies and thus to an overestimation of the @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  cross section .",
    "as expected , the discrepancy between the mcf prediction and the experimental data increases with decreasing energy .",
    "a similar behavior has been found in other cases , see e.g.  the @xmath2sm(@xmath1,@xmath12)@xmath39gd reaction @xcite , the @xmath40sn(@xmath1,@xmath12 ) @xmath41te reaction @xcite , or the @xmath42cd(@xmath1,@xmath12)@xmath43sn reaction @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to make such general statements on the many - parameter avr potential .",
    "this potential has been adjusted to a huge data base of elastic scattering and reaction data @xcite , and excellent agreement has been found for many reactions especially in the @xmath13 range . the avr potential shows the best agreement of the global potentials with the elastic scattering angular distributions , and it reproduces the @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  data well at higher energies above 13mev .",
    "however , it underestimates the data at lower energies significantly .",
    "the frr potential has been optimized for reaction data at low energies .",
    "its parameters are energy - independent and close to the mcf potential in most cases . similar to the mcf case , because of its energy independence it can not be expected that the frr potential is able to reproduce simultaneously elastic scattering data above the coulomb barrier and reaction data below the coulomb barrier . despite the big success in predicting reaction cross sections at low energies , the simple frr potential can not be the basis for a global potential in a broad energy range .    the mcf potential with an additional energy dependence of the depth of the imaginary potential has been used in @xcite to reproduce their new @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  data .",
    "although this is in principle the best way to improve the mcf potential , there are two disadvantages of the sar potential .",
    "obviously , reaction data are required to fit the energy dependence of the sar potential . and",
    "in addition , the chosen underlying mcf potential uses a volume woods - saxon imaginary part which has been found  according to recent studies @xcite  to be probably not fully adequate for low energies below the coulomb barrier ; here surface woods - saxon potentials should be preferred .",
    "consequently , the sar potential is not able to reproduce the elastic scattering angular distributions .",
    "it turns out that the angular distributions of the sar and mcf potentials are almost identical above 25mev because the mcf and sar potentials are almost identical there . even at 19mev where the imaginary depth of the sar potential is about 25% lower than the mcf depth",
    ", the calculated angular distributions of mcf and sar agree within a few per cent , i.e.  within a linewidth in fig .",
    "[ fig : scat ] ; therefore , the sar potential is not shown in fig .  [ fig : scat ] .",
    "the energy - dependent potential of this work has been derived from elastic scattering data .",
    "local optical potentials have been derived from the available angular distributions between 19 and 45mev by fitting the parameters of the real part ( strength and width of the folding potential ) and the imaginary part ( woods - saxon parametrization ) .",
    "because of the small variation of the found parameters at the different energies ( see table [ tab : pot ] ) , these parameters could be combined to derive a common potential with an energy - dependent depth of the imaginary surface potential .",
    "this common potential maintains the good reproduction of the elastic scattering data and the derived total reaction cross sections @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , it turns out that this potential is able to predict the cross section of the @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  cross section at lower energies , in particular in the energy range of the new experimental data of @xcite between 10 and 15mev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sfact ] ) .",
    "thus , the new potential is able to describe @xmath0pr(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0pr  elastic scattering data at energies around and above the coulomb barrier simultaneously with @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  reaction data below the coulomb barrier .",
    "the parametrization of this new potential , i.e.  a double folding potential in the real part and a surface woods - saxon potential with fixed geometry and energy - dependent depth , should be tested in further cases in forthcoming work .",
    "for a detailed study of a particular target nucleus , several elastic scattering angular distributions are required to fix the shape and the energy dependence of the imaginary potential .",
    "however , the found geometry parameters in the present @xmath0pr-@xmath1  case ( @xmath44fm and @xmath45fm ) are close to standard values ; it should be possible to apply these parameters to other target nuclei",
    ". the main problem will be the determination of the energy dependence of the depth of the imaginary surface potential . here",
    "considerations similar to @xcite will be helpful where parameters of the imaginary part have been put in relation to the coulomb barrier .",
    "it is obvious that the predictions from such a potential have to be compared to experimental reaction data below the coulomb barrier which are  despite significant improvement in the recent years  still not widely available .",
    "the previous discussion may also be summarized to provide a general recipe to find a widely useful potential .",
    "first of all , the potential has to reproduce the total reaction cross section @xmath3  at energies above the coulomb barrier .",
    "however , because of the @xmath30 proportionality of @xmath10 for small @xmath11 , this requirement is almost trivial and can be fulfilled by many potentials .",
    "next , among the many @xmath1-nucleus potentials which are able to fulfill this first condition , these potentials have to be selected which are in addition able to reproduce the elastic scattering angular distributions .",
    "this ensures the correct strength and geometry of the chosen potential ( in particular of the imaginary part ) which is essential for the prediction of @xmath3  below the coulomb barrier .",
    "this conclusion is also a strong motivation to extend the measurements of elastic scattering angular distributions .",
    "a new local potential for the system @xmath0pr-@xmath1  has been derived from elastic scattering angular distributions .",
    "the derived potential is able to predict the total reaction cross section @xmath3  which is dominated by the @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm  cross section in the energy range of the new experimental data of @xcite .",
    "thus , the new potential for @xmath0pr-@xmath1  is able for the first time to describe simultaneously elastic scattering data around and above the coulomb barrier and reaction data below the coulomb barrier .",
    "such a simultaneous description was not achieved and/or aimed for in earlier work using the global potentials of @xcite or the local potential suggested in @xcite .",
    "reasons for the partial success at higher energies and failure at lower energies of global potentials are carefully analyzed by studying the reflexion coefficients @xmath8 and the contribution @xmath10 of the @xmath11-th partial wave to the total reaction cross section @xmath3 .",
    "it is found that above the coulomb barrier @xmath10 for small angular momenta are predicted correctly by most global potentials because of a simple @xmath30 proportionality which is almost independent of details of the optical potential .",
    "this results in minor differences for the total reaction cross section @xmath3  which have to arise from a few partial waves around @xmath33 for the @xmath0pr-@xmath1  case under study in this work .",
    "however , at low energies below the coulomb barrier this simple @xmath30 proportionality of @xmath10 for small @xmath11 vanishes , the @xmath10 become sensitive to details of the potential , and consequently predictions for @xmath3  from global potentials show a huge spread .",
    "precise scattering data at different energies around and close above the coulomb barrier are required to determine a potential ( in particular the shape and strength of its imaginary part ) which is able to predict total reaction cross sections @xmath3  not only above , but also below the coulomb barrier .    because the new local potential has a well - defined geometry derived from elastic scattering , its extrapolation to low energies and its predictions for the @xmath10 and the resulting @xmath3  should be more reliable than predictions from other global potentials .",
    "the parametrization of the new local potential may finally become the basis for a new global potential to solve or at least reduce the long - standing problem of @xmath1-nucleus potentials at low energies below the coulomb barrier and the resulting uncertainties for the prediction of @xmath1-induced reaction cross sections at astrophysically relevant energies .",

    "<S> elastic scattering data for @xmath0pr(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0pr have been analyzed to derive a new energy - dependent local potential for the @xmath0pr-@xmath1 system . </S>",
    "<S> this potential is used successfully to predict the cross section of the @xmath0pr(@xmath1,n)@xmath2pm reaction at low energies where new experimental data have become available very recently . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to various global potentials , this new potential is able to reproduce simultaneously elastic scattering data around and above the coulomb barrier and reaction data below the coulomb barrier for the @xmath0pr-@xmath1 system . </S>",
    "<S> reasons for the partial failure of the global potentials are explained by intrinsic properties of the scattering matrix and their variation with energy . </S>",
    "<S> the new local potential may become the basis for the construction of a new global @xmath1-nucleus potential . </S>"
