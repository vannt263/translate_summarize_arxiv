    "charmonium physics has been shown to be a powerful tool in the understanding of the strong interaction and hadronic structure .",
    "probes like antiprotons are unprecedented due to the gluon - rich environment , which they assure . in the panda experiment @xcite at the future fair facility antiprotons in the momentum range between @xmath3gev/@xmath4 and @xmath5gev/@xmath4 will interact with an internal target .",
    "most of the measurements require a proton target and the use frozen micro - spheres , `` pellets '' , of hydrogen with a typical size of @xmath6 m is planned  @xcite . to create pellets hydrogen liquid",
    "is forced through a nozzle and , under the influence of vibrations , the liquid jet breaks up into droplets .",
    "these are then injected into vacuum during which freezing occurs and the result is a stream of pellets ( up to @xmath7pellets / sec ) reaching the interaction point .",
    "such pellets have the advantage of being discrete objects separated by a few millimeters distance , and hence individually traceable .",
    "this , however , poses technical challenges which , in a first approach using a light - guide system and preamplifiers , were difficult to overcome  @xcite .",
    "we propose the use of fast ccd line - scan cameras which we believe is sufficiently developed to be of use . as typical experimental set - ups such as panda",
    "leave almost no space close to the interaction point , arrays of cameras and lasers must be arranged above and below the experiment .",
    "the position and time that the individually - traced pellet passes the beam has then to be extrapolated from information gathered up to 2 m away .    in the first part of this document",
    "we show how the small amount of light reflected from a pellet can be registered in a commercial 100khz ccd line - scan camera . in the second part",
    "we investigate how such tracked pellets would improve the fraction of d - meson decays that can be observed as displaced vertices in panda .",
    "the novel idea is to realize a tracking system using reflected laser light from the pellets seen by fast ccd line - scan cameras located above and below the interaction point .",
    "four cameras should be positioned in pairs , two above and two below the interaction point , with 90@xmath8 relative angle to each other . this way two parallel planes are defined , each providing the pellet - position in @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the pellet path is extracted from the position information from each plane and relative timing .",
    "a feature of the current pellet stream is a rather big difference in velocities of the pellets .",
    "thus _ a priori _ it can not be excluded that pellets may overtake each other between the two observation planes .",
    "the consequent problem of assigning a unique number to each pellet can be solved by having an additional camera at almost any place in the pellets path .",
    "also the system will naturally provide rates and distributions for the statistical analysis .",
    "a prototype was built at the pellet - test station ( pts ) at the svedberg laboratory , uppsala , sweden .",
    "the pts is an independent pellet target system which is , to a large extent , a direct copy of the wasa pellet target system  @xcite .",
    "the pellet generator located at the top of the system is apart from minor improvements identical .",
    "the lower vacuum system is designed to perform vacuum and distribution studies in a configuration resembling a typical internal experiment .",
    "the prototype of the tracking system was attached to windows of the lower vacuum system and consists of an aviiva line - scan camera with 512 pixels ( each @xmath11m@xmath12 ) and a laser placed perpendicularly to it ( see figure  [ fig : lsc_setup ] ) .",
    "a laser of 35mw with a width of 5 mm and height of about @xmath13 m was used , covering the whole width of the distribution and reducing the probability of having two pellets simultaneously inside the laser light down to the percent - level .",
    "the line read - out speed and dead time of the camera have been determined experimentally to by @xmath14hz and @xmath15% , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the test measurements showed the feasibility of detecting individual pellets and determining their position with such a system .",
    "the light yield under 90@xmath16 was sufficient to be detected in the pixels of the camera .",
    "standard optics ( focal length 50 mm and f=1.4 ) at a focal distance of 184 mm and magnification of 0.38 were used .",
    "the distribution of pellets 2.3 m below their place of production is shown in figure  [ fig : pelletdata ] ( left ) for two different cases .",
    "a circular skimmer of 2.0 mm diameter is situated 1.07 m above the measurement plane and cuts the tails of the distribution . a centered pellet stream ( maximized count rate )",
    "produces a symmetric distribution ( solid line ) .",
    "a pellet stream moved to the right results in smaller count rate and an asymmetric pellet distribution ( dotted line ) , while the boundaries ( given by the fixed skimmer ) remain constant .",
    "one pixel corresponds to 37@xmath0 m , thus the total pellet - stream width is calculated to be 3.8 mm which is in good agreement with the expected width of 3.7 mm from geometrical considerations .",
    "the right side of figure  [ fig : pelletdata ] shows the time distribution between two subsequent pellets .",
    "each line corresponds to @xmath17s , during which the light in the pixels is sampled .",
    "two pellets are seen within a single line in 2.5% of the scans taken .",
    "but in most cases this poses no problem for the tracking , as the pellets can be distinguished due to separated positions .",
    "6.2% of the pellets appear in the subsequent line , while 50% are detected within less than @xmath18s .",
    "these results confirm that the distribution of pellets is governed by the statistical selection of pellets through the skimmer and the spread in velocities , rather than by the frequency which is used to generate the original droplets ( about 80khz ) .",
    "the light intensity profile recorded with the camera indicates that we could be at the limit of the sensor s sensitivity .",
    "the fact that the independently measured rates in a carefully adjusted counter coincide , however , make a significant inefficiency unlikely . in our case",
    "more light reflected into the camera would have helped to study the effect .",
    "another advantage of having superfluous light would be that one could close the lens aperture to avoid smearing due to a limited range of focus . a stronger laser arranged to angles closer to 180@xmath16 with respect to the camera ( i.e. shining almost into the camera ) may help in that respect , as observations indicate a large transparency of those pellets .",
    "all bulky target equipment must be placed outside the detector at panda .",
    "therefore , the distance between the two above - mentioned camera planes will be @xmath19 m and the time delay for a particular pellet position will be @xmath20s due to the pellet travel time .",
    "a latency of this magnitude causes the information to enter at a higher level in the trigger scheme , but can be efficiently used for any offline analysis .",
    "the position resolution of the reconstructed vertex will depend on several factors .",
    "the pixel size of @xmath21 m leads to a resolution of @xmath22 m in the plane of the pellets .",
    "the largest uncertainty will be introduced by the alignment of the cameras .",
    "this depends upon the construction and the calibration procedures .",
    "it is assumed that such an absolute alignment could be done within @xmath23 m .",
    "both uncertainties are independent and are added quadratically . for our approach",
    "we assume a symmetric arrangement with respect to the beam line .",
    "thus we calculate the @xmath9-coordinate at the interaction point simply as the mean of the values for each plane ( denoted by 1 and 2 ) @xmath24 .",
    "the same applies for the @xmath10-coordinate .",
    "as the uncertainties are equal in both planes we obtain the overall uncertainty of the pellet - position at the interaction point for the @xmath9 and @xmath10-coordinate @xmath25 the third coordinate along the direction of travel of the pellets ( decreasing @xmath26 ) is determined by the time resolution , which is equal to the active time of the camera .",
    "the maximum error we would expect here is 11@xmath0s which corresponds to well below a millimeter of pellet travel since the typical speed is @xmath27 m/s .",
    "one of the physics goals of panda is charmonium spectroscopy .",
    "charmonium spectroscopy above the @xmath28-threshold has hardly been investigated because d - mesons are hard to select in an experiment due to their short lifetime . in panda",
    "we have several measures to identify d - mesons and one tool is to directly recognize the displaced vertex caused by the decay .",
    "this assumes that the charged particles reach the innermost tracking detectors . at panda",
    "this is a micro - vertex detector ( mvd ) arranged in a barrel geometry of layers with silicon pixels and silicon strips .",
    "any charged particle will be detected here and the resolution for the decay @xmath29 is estimated to be about @xmath30 m  @xcite .",
    "such information could enter early into the trigger scheme and allow the pre - selection of potential `` hidden - charm candidates '' .    a much more powerful tool to identify d",
    "- meson decays is the reconstruction of their decay length , through knowledge of the primary reaction vertex .",
    "often this primary vertex can not be reconstructed using the reaction products , as they tend to either be too short - lived or neutral particles . tracking individual pellets , as proposed here , yields a completely independent determination of this primary vertex . in conjunction with the charged particle tracking ,",
    "such a system would be used both for the physical analysis and for background rejection .",
    "we investigated the impact of such an approach by studying the benchmark process @xmath31 where the hidden - charmed @xmath32 is produced at rest in the center - of - mass system , corresponding to an antiproton momentum of 6.59gev/@xmath4 . in order to be able to quantify the impact of the pellet - tracking method we compare two scenarios , one with pellet tracking and one without .",
    "decays of charged particles are often accompanied by neutral particles in the final state ( e.g.  @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) .",
    "therefore the reconstruction of the vertex is not possible from the observed charged decay products . to build an efficient trigger on",
    "such decays one needs to identify a significant kink in the particle track . however , one problem in identifying kinks from the d - mesons in the reaction above is the lifetime @xmath35fs @xcite leading to an average travel length of only @xmath36 mm .",
    "in addition , demanding an exclusive detection of the d - decay particles would be rather a inefficient constraint since the decay modes that contain at least one neutral particle add up to a substantial fraction .",
    "already foreseen is to reconstruct vertices from the mvd response to be used in a first - level trigger , to see whether two particles have decayed within some narrow time window and if their decay points are separated @xcite .",
    "in such a case the knowledge of the primary vertex would be of great help and therefore the discrete nature of pellets is an important advantage when compared to a typical cluster - jet target with a continuous target density and a much larger spatial extension .",
    "we will not look further on a comparison between cluster targets and a pellet target , but rather compare tracked pellets to untracked pellets .    to explore this",
    ", we introduce the convolution between the antiproton beam and target as the `` possible volume of primary interactions '' , v@xmath37 . for the antiproton beam at the target location",
    "we can assume that the combined effects of ( stochastic ) cooling and heating due to target and intra - beam scattering will result in a gaussian distribution with rms widths @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the horizontal and vertical direction , respectively .",
    "a single pellet can be assumed to be spherical and of diameter @xmath6 m .",
    "if we randomly generate primary vertices inside the pellet as many as 98% of the d - mesons will decay outside .",
    "+    we will consider primary vertices v@xmath37 based on an antiproton beam with @xmath40 mm and :    * a randomly spread distribution in the @xmath41-plane within a circle ( left ) .",
    "for further details see ref .",
    "] of diameter 2 mm , which is to correspond to untracked pellets , and * a trace - tracked pellet for which the @xmath41-position is determined to within a diameter of 0.1 mm .    for convenience ,",
    "we take the center of the region of primary interactions as reference frame , i.e.  ( 0,0,0 ) , such that a direct comparison between the above - mentioned cases is possible . in figure",
    "[ fig : vertices ] we see 10,000 randomly generated vertices . figures a ) and b ) show the primary @xmath42-vertices ( corresponding also to the @xmath32-decay points ) whereas c ) and d ) show the distributions of the d - meson decay points .",
    "we observe that the separation of primary and secondary vertices will be much more efficient with pellet tracking , but still possible without .    to detect neutral d@xmath43-mesons which decay even faster than d@xmath44 it will be of even greater importance to know the primary vertex",
    ". otherwise it will be difficult  if not impossible  to distinguish prompt reactions like @xmath45 from those where the resonant decay @xmath46 is involved .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the secondary vertices will be shifted in the longitudinal direction as the beam momentum and therefore the lorentz boost increases .",
    "this will , of course , facilitate the vertex separation .",
    "we define the longitudinal displacement of the secondary and primary vertex @xmath47 here @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the @xmath10-coordinates of the d - meson decay point and maximum value of the possible primary vertex , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath50 will depend on the uncertainty of @xmath48 , thus the mvd resolution , and the uncertainty of @xmath51 , which we assume to be 10% . in table",
    "[ t : disp_res ] the percentage of d - mesons that one can identify by their decay ( i.e.  having a displacement @xmath52 ) is shown .",
    "we find that the identification can be improved by a factor of 4 to 5 using tracked pellets in comparison to the conventional approach .",
    ".fraction of d - mesons with a positive ( thus distinguishable ) displacement .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have shown the feasibility of tracking individual pellets using laser light reflected into a fast line - scan camera . in a test experiment the rates from a conventional system and the expected transverse distribution of pellets could be well reproduced . by using several cameras and lasers we propose a system which could provide a three - dimensional vertex point at any experiment using such a target . if used at the future panda experiment we expect to obtain a resolution at the interaction point of the order @xmath53 m in the two perpendicular directions and @xmath54 mm in the parallel direction , with respect to the pellet stream",
    ".    a pellet - tracking system would in particular be advantageous in the study of events with hidden charm , where the reconstruction of the d - meson decay length is a prerequisite .",
    "it would also be used online to reduce the data stored in a late stage of the data - acquisition system and for the rejection of background .",
    "we have demonstrated on the benchmark reaction @xmath2 that the efficiency of the reconstruction of d - meson decays can be increased by a factor of @xmath55 using a system that tracks pellets .",
    "this shows that such an approach will substantially improve the data quality .",
    "we would like to thank all the staff of the svedberg laboratory for their help with all kind of odds and ends , especially kjell fransson , gunnar norman , and the workshop personnel .",
