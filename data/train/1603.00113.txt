    "self - assembly is the process of forming an ordered structure from initially disordered components that only interact locally , without external direction . at the molecular level , this process is a common technique for fabrication of nanostructures with periodic patterns  @xcite . due to the important role of this fabrication technique in nanotechnology ,",
    "several researchers have studied self - assembly phenomena at a theoretical level based on abstract models  @xcite .",
    "self - assembled nanostructures usually demonstrate periodic patterns that only depend on the nature of their components and the environmental conditions under which the patterns are formed .",
    "however , several applications require fabrication of nanostructures with certain non - periodic geometries  @xcite .",
    "given the major role of molecular self - assembly in fabrication of periodic nanostructures , it is reasonable to ask if this process can be externally directed to fabricate nanostructures of desired geometry which are not necessarily periodic .",
    "such a _ directed self - assembly _ process is the focus of this paper .    in directed self - assembly",
    ", a number of charged nanoparticles ( e.g. , dna tiles ) are manipulated by external electrical fields to form a nanostructure of desired geometry .",
    "the directing electrical fields are generated and controlled by relatively small number of electrodes ( compared to the number of particles ) located at fixed locations on the substrate containing the particles .",
    "the dynamics of the particles are primarily governed by the interactions between them ( self - assembly ) , and is modified to some extent by manipulation of the electrical potentials of these electrodes ( external direction ) .",
    "the particles are initially distributed randomly on the substrate and are perturbed by random disturbances during the assembly process . since the particle positions can not be measured during the course of control , a feedback loop can not be established and the electrodes are actuated only by open - loop controls .    the control objective is to direct the particles towards formation of a desired pattern despite the uncertainty in their dynamics and initial positions . under an optimal design",
    ", this control must maximize the probability of forming the desired pattern by the end of the assembly process , and maintain the formed structure under a static control afterward .",
    "such a constant static control creates a stable equilibrium representing the desired pattern .",
    "in addition to this intended stable equilibrium , the static control inherently creates multiple undesired stable equilibria , and a major challenge of an optimal control is to prevent the system falling into such _",
    "kinetic traps_. given the large number of these kinetic traps and the inherent uncertainty in the initial distribution and dynamics of the particles , the system will most likely be trapped by an undesired stable equilibrium ( formation of a wrong pattern ) , unless a phase of dynamic control ( time - dependent ) is applied prior to the static control .",
    "this paper intends to develop an analytic framework for study of directed self - assembly , including a systematic method for control design . rather than focusing on a detailed model of the physical process",
    ", the main emphasis is on providing a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts such as static control , kinetic traps , and dynamic control . to be consistent with this approach ,",
    "the models and control problem considered in this paper are abstractions of real - world directed self - assembly : they capture the essence of this phenomenon but do not reflect all its details . in particular",
    ", the paper focuses on directed self - assembly of linear structures ( one - dimensional patterns along straight lines ) , a simplified model also adopted in @xcite to study `` undirected '' self - assembly .",
    "this special case of the more general planar patterns demonstrates certain properties that facilitate exact characterization of the stable equilibria of the system , which in turn , allows for a rigorous analysis and control design methodology .",
    "the concepts and methods developed here for linear patterns are equally valid in two dimensions , while generalization of some computational procedures might not be immediate .",
    "such a generalization , at least approximately , is the subject of our future work .",
    "this paper adopts two different but closely related models to describe directed self - assembly .",

    "this model is precise for larger particles of micrometer diameter and its continuous nature facilitates our analysis in section  [ lineargeometry.controldesignsection ] . later in section  [ lineargeometry.discretemodelsection ] ,",
    "a discrete model is presented for nano - scale particles , and it is shown how the results of section  [ lineargeometry.controldesignsection ] , originally developed for the continuous model , can be tailored to this discrete model only with minor modifications .",
    "our main results on the structure of the kinetic traps , control design , and optimization of the electrodes are presented in section  [ lineargeometry.controldesignsection ] .",
    "the system of particles considered in this paper is described at the nano - scale ( @xmath0 ) by a discrete ising model and a master equation  @xcite . in this model",
    ", the particles can occupy only a finite set of positions along a line segment , in contrast to a continuous model used for larger particles ( @xmath1 ) in which the particles can position continuously at any arbitrary point along the line segment .",
    "the latter model is directly derived from the classical newton s second law of motion , and coulomb s law that governs the interactions between the particles and the forces applied to the particles by the electrodes .",
    "such a continuous model is more intuitive and mathematically more tractable , thus it is a convenient point of departure to explain the concepts and control design methodology developed in this paper .",
    "we begin with this continuous model and construct our control design method on this basis .",
    "later in section  [ lineargeometry.discretemodelsection ] , we present the discrete model and show that for the purpose of control design using our proposed method , the two models are mathematically equivalent and can be interchanged with minor modifications .",
    "in particular , our control design relies on the steady - state behaviors of these models which match closely despite their different dynamical behaviors .",

    "<S> an optimal control strategy is developed to construct nanostructures of desired geometry along line segments by means of directed self - assembly of charged particles . such a control strategy determines the electric potentials of a set of electrodes located at fixed points in the line segment . </S>",
    "<S> the particles move under the electric forces generated by these electrodes and by the interactions between the particles themselves to form a desired pattern eventually . due to technology limitations , </S>",
    "<S> the particle positions can not be measured during the course of control , so that the control is open - loop in nature . </S>",
    "<S> such an open - loop control optimally changes the electrode potentials in time in order to create a desired pattern with the highest probability , despite the inherent uncertainty in the initial positions and the dynamical behaviors of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> two models are proposed to describe the uncertain dynamics of the particles : a continuous model relying on a set of nonlinear stochastic differential equations , and a discrete ising model consisting of a large dimensional continuous - time markov chain . </S>",
    "<S> while the first model is more mathematically tractable , the second one more precisely describes particles at the nanometer scale . </S>",
    "<S> the control design procedure begins with the continuous model and identifies the structure of its stable equilibria , which is used later to propose a piecewise constant structure for the control and to demonstrate that the optimal value of each piece is independently obtained from a certain static optimization problem . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown next that the design procedure can be applied to the discrete model with only minor modifications . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical example of control design is presented .    </S>",
