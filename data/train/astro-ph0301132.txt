    "although the number of detected @xmath0-ray bursts has increased tremendously due to the batse instrument on board the compton @xmath0-ray observatory @xcite , unique identifications and quick follow - up observations of the celestial object that harbours the burst site are rare .",
    "this issue has been successfully addressed by the bepposax satellite , that monitors a large fraction of the sky ( @xmath2 ) in the intermediate x - ray range @xcite and is able to derive burst localisations with an accuracy of @xmath3 . with such improved localisations ,",
    "the beppo - sax team has succeeded in detecting x - ray afterglows @xcite , by which valuable insight into the emission mechanism was gained .",
    "finding @xmath0-ray burst counterparts and performing spectroscopy at wavelengths other than the @xmath0-ray band during the active phase of a burst as well as providing good localisations for follow - up observations is the basic scientific motivation of the hete-2 mission .",

    "the high energy transient explorer ( hete-2 ) is a dedicated mission for the localisation and spectroscopy of @xmath0-ray bursts .",
    "details of the instrumentation of hete-2 and the mission are given in @xcite .",
    "its scientific payload consists of three experiments : _ fregate _ , a scintillation crystal experiment , that is expected to provide triggers because of its high sensitivity and large sky coverage , _ sxc _ , a coded - mask imager based on a x - ray ccd chip design , which is able to localise @xmath0-ray bursts with very high spatial resolution , and the core experiment _",
    "wxm_.    the wide field x - ray monitor _ wxm _ consists of two perpendicularly oriented 1-dimensional coded mask cameras , in which photons are detected by position sensitive proportional counters .",
    "the detectors , one pair for each of the two orthogonal systems , are filled with xenon gas at a pressure of @xmath4 with an admixture of @xmath5 carbon dioxide as a quenching gas .",
    "each detector contains three carbon wire anodes in which the position of an absorbed photon is inferred by comparing the accumulated charges at both ends of a wire .",
    "_ wxm _ achieves a position resolution of @xmath6 ( fwhm ) at @xmath7 .",
    "a veto system below the counting wires reduces the background due to charged particles .",
    "_ wxm _ is sensitive to photons with energies @xmath8 in the range @xmath9 with an relative energy resolution of @xmath10 at @xmath11 .",
    "the mask pattern , identical for the @xmath12- and @xmath13-system , is placed @xmath14 above the detectors and is composed of 103 elements , each @xmath15 in width . on third of the elements",
    "are open and randomly distributed .",
    "the parameters have been optimised with respect to source localisation accuracy for the expected levels of signal and background photon count rates @xcite .",
    "the combined @xmath12- and @xmath13-systems are monitoring a field of view of approximately @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ fig : hete ] shows the actual mask pattern of a _ wxm _ camera .",
    "further details of the _ wxm _ cameras can be found in @xcite .    in order to provide other experiments with precise localisations of @xmath0-ray burst sites within seconds after burst onset",
    ", an array of twelve burst alert stations has been installed below hete-2 s flight path .",
    "once received , the information is relayed to the grb coordinate network ( gcn ) , from where it may be obtained by interested observers .",
    "for the sake of readability , the algorithm is described for determining the angle of incidence @xmath17 in the @xmath12-detector , completely analogous formulae apply to the @xmath13-system . figure [ fig : angles ] provides the definition of all quantities involved .",
    "the task of localising a single point source is performed by computing the correlation function @xmath18(x)$ ] of the mask pattern @xmath19 and the recorded intensity distribution @xmath20 ; the asterisk denoting complex conjugation :    @xmath21(x)=\\int m(\\lambda)\\cdot f^*(\\lambda+x ) d\\lambda\\mbox{. } \\label{eqn : correlation}\\ ] ]    the correlation function @xmath22(x)$ ] will peak at a value @xmath23 , indicating the distance @xmath20 is shifted with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "this yields the angle of incidence @xmath17 by @xmath24 , where @xmath14 is the distance between mask and detector . in @xmath19 ,",
    "open elements of the mask pattern have been assigned a value of @xmath25 , whereas closed elements correspond to a value of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the open fraction of hete-2 s imaging system .",
    "this method is known as balanced correlation and removes the correlation background .",
    "there exist more sophisticated correlation schemes such as unbiased balanced correlation ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , that do take into account partial shadowing of the mask onto the detector by bursts in the periphery of the field of view and increased coding noise caused by steady strong off - axis sources . for hete-2 s flight algorithm we rely on basic balanced correlation for three reasons :",
    "the width of the mask is almost twice as large as the active area of the detector and only bursts at angles @xmath28 off the optical axis are affected by partial shadowing .",
    "furthermore , the running average of the mask s transparency is close to constant with deviations being very small , so that the modulation of the pattern is insensitive to angle of incidence . thirdly , in hete-2 s nominal survey mode , the satellite is rotated in such a way that strong x - ray sources are avoided and the assumption of isotropically incidenting background radiation is valid .      in reality",
    "the correlation is complicated by imperfections of the detector : the photons travel a finite path before interacting and the loci of photons interacting in the detector are measured with finite position resolution ( in the case of _ wxm _ to @xmath6 , subtending an angle of @xmath29 ) .",
    "whereas the finite position resolution simply results in a blurring of the image , the penetration of energetic photons effectively induces an additional shift in the image , if the event is happening at nonzero angles of incidence , and causes the angles of incidence to be overestimated .",
    "this effect increases in a complex fashion with distance from the center of the field of view and is of the order of @xmath30 at @xmath31 from the optical axis for a photon distribution following a power law spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath32 .",
    "in contrast to a time consuming monte carlo simulation , in which one determines the image of the mask pattern under estimated angles of incidence , the algorithm presented in this article aims at modelling all effects involved in the delapidation of the mask pattern , enabling a much faster localisation of the @xmath0-ray burst site .",
    "imaging aberrations may be described by applying suitable changes to the mask pattern @xmath19 prior to the calculation of the correlation function .",
    "this can be archieved by convolving the mask pattern @xmath19 with integration kernels @xmath33 and @xmath34 , that describe the penetration of highly energetic photons and the detector resolution , respectively ,    @xmath35(x)=\\int m(\\lambda)\\cdot p(x-\\lambda ) d\\lambda\\mbox{. } \\label{eqn : convolution}\\ ] ]    the convolution kernel @xmath33 that is used for describing the penetration of photons is given by equation [ eqn : penetrate ] :    @xmath36\\cdot x\\right)\\mbox { , } \\label{eqn : penetrate}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is the heaviside function and _ sgn _ the signum function the convolution yields an altered mask pattern @xmath38(x)$ ] , in which the penetration of photons is incorporated .",
    "the length scale @xmath39 of the exponential decay , given by equation [ eqn : ceqn ] , is equal to the spectrally averaged attenuation length @xmath40 of photons inside the detector , corrected by a projection factor :    @xmath41    estimates for the angles of incidence @xmath17 and @xmath42 follow from a source localisation with the unmodified mask pattern @xmath19 in a first step .",
    "the finite spatial resolution of the position sensitive proportional counter is described by convolution with a gaussian integration kernel as in equation [ eqn : resolution ] :    @xmath43    the standard deviation corresponds to a value for full width half maximum of @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath40 , @xmath44 depends only very weakly on the spectral distribution of the incident photons and is considered to be constant .",
    "after convolution with @xmath34 , the mask pattern has been modified to @xmath45(x)$ ] .",
    "@xmath46 is the image of the mask pattern under ideal statistics and the source reconstruction with @xmath46 should not display any deviation from the ideal behaviour .",
    "the correlation @xmath47(x)$ ] yields a corrected value @xmath48 for the angle of incidence .",
    "due to their high numerical complexity it is favourable to perform both the convolutions and the image localisation by correlation in the fourier domain .",
    "the nomenclature is such that lower case letters denote functions in real space and the corresponding upper case letters their fourier transforms :    @xmath49=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int m(x)\\exp(-ikx)dx\\mbox{. } \\label{eqn : fourierpair}\\ ] ]    convolutions and correlations reduce by virtue of equation [ eqn : fconvolve ] to mere multiplications in fourier space .",
    "the asterisk denotes complex conjugation :    @xmath50(x)&=&\\mathcal{f}^{-1}\\left[p(k)m(k)\\right]\\mbox{,}\\\\ \\left[f\\otimes m''\\right](x)&=&\\mathcal{f}^{-1}\\left[f(k)^*m''(k)\\right]\\mbox{. } \\end{array } \\label{eqn : fconvolve}\\ ] ]    diagram [ dia : cc ] summarises all steps .",
    "starting from the fourier - transform of the mask pattern @xmath51 $ ] , both convolutions and the correlation are carried out in fourier - space by determining the product @xmath52 .",
    "inverse transformation yields the correlation function @xmath53 $ ] , from which the corrected angle of incidence @xmath48 is derived :    @xmath54    in comparision to the _ wfc _ camera on board the bepposax satellite , the penetration effect is noticably more pronounced in the case of hete-2 .",
    "evaluating the average attenuation length for a photon at the corner of the field of view projected onto the detector plane determines the angular deviation in the worst case .",
    "this value for _ wfc _ is @xmath55 times smaller compared to _",
    "wxm _ , because of the narrower field of view , the higher gas pressure , which results in a shorter average attenuation length and the larger distance between the mask and detector .",
    "furthermore , being a genuine 2-dimensional camera , the aberration vector field of _ wfc _ is radial and does not have the complex angular dependence described by equation [ eqn : ceqn ] .",
    "in order to investigate to which extend the algorithm is capable of correcting systematic deviations , a set of @xmath56 monte carlo images containing a large number of photons ( @xmath57 ) was generated , so that the statistical scatter in the source reconstruction is small .",
    "the simulated burst positions were randomly distributed , the angles of incidence ranging from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "the number of incident photons was corrected with a factor of @xmath60 for the purpose of coping for the decreasing projected area of the detector at increasing angles of incidence .",
    "the spectral distribution of photons followed a power law with spectral index of @xmath32 , which is considered to be shallow , but not untypical for @xmath0-ray bursts @xcite . because of the flatness of the spectrum , the aberration effect due to penetrating photons is distinctive and easy to study .",
    "localisation of photons by the proportional counter was modelled by employing detector response data taken prior to the launch .",
    "figure [ fig : pure ] shows the deviation @xmath61 of the uncorrected reconstructed burst position from the nominal burst position as a function of angle of incidence @xmath62 .",
    "the aberration increases with increasing distance @xmath62 from the center of the field of view .",
    "each point corresponds to the localisation derived from a monte carlo image .",
    "furthermore , one observes a widening of the scatter of @xmath61 with increasing distance from the optical axis .",
    "this is due to the fact that the aberration , being proportional to the function @xmath63 to first order , is concave for @xmath64 and convex for @xmath65 .",
    "the magnitude of this curvature increases with increasing distance from the origin .      in order to disentangle the contributions from statistical scatter in the reconstruction from residual systematics ,",
    "the dataset has been split into @xmath66 intervals in @xmath67 . for each interval",
    "@xmath68 the mean value @xmath69 of @xmath70 as well as the standard deviation @xmath71 has been derived . because the intervals are chosen such that they cover an angular range of just @xmath72 , the scatter @xmath71 can be assumed to be dominated by statistics .",
    "an increase in photon number @xmath73 per image would have reduced the statistical scatter , according to @xmath74.from the values @xmath69 we derive the quantity @xmath75 , which is the mean quadratic deviation from zero .",
    "further on , from @xmath71 we determine the average statistical scatter @xmath76 . from those two quantities ,",
    "we define the spot size @xmath77.figure [ fig : mcdata_depend ] illustrates the performance of the applied corrections : the mean quadratic deviation @xmath69 as well as the statistical error @xmath71 is plotted against the angle of incidence @xmath67 .",
    "as the flatness indicates , @xmath69 is consistent with zero , i.e. the imaging aberrations have been properly corrected .",
    "moreover , @xmath71 has become independent from the angle of incidence @xmath67 , which indicates that the second order influence of @xmath78 on the reconstruction has been properly accounted for .",
    "residual deviations are caused by detector nonlinearities , especially in the charge division method by which the position of an absorbed photon is determined .",
    "the mean statistical scatter has been determined to @xmath79 and the mean systematic deviation from zero to @xmath80 .",
    "the algorithm thus fulfills the design requirements .",
    "figure [ fig : mcdata_spot ] shows the result of combining the reconstructions in @xmath12- and @xmath13-direction .",
    "the scatter plot is circularly symmetric and the width of the spot corresponds to @xmath81 .    in the above analysis , the value for the average attenuation length @xmath40 has been optimised is such a way that @xmath82 assumed a minimal value .",
    "the smallest deviations resulted in the choice @xmath83 , which is in agreement with the theoretical value @xmath84 .",
    "the theoretical value was derived by determining the flux weighted average of tabulated values for the photon attenuation length in xenon , where the photon spectrum has been altered by the spectral photon absorption probability .",
    "data from the x - ray source _",
    "scorpius x-1 _ has been taken for calibration purposes .",
    "due to hete-2 s antisolar pointing , any source will drift through the field of view at ecliptic rate , i.e. @xmath85 .",
    "the orientation of the satellite was such that the _ wxm _ coordinate system was rotated @xmath86 relative to the celestial @xmath87 frame . _ scorpius x-1 _ was viewed at angles of incidence ranging from @xmath88 to @xmath89 and at @xmath90 fixed .",
    "the spacecraft attitude was known to an accuracy surpassing @xmath1 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the spectrum of _ scorpius x-1 _ , being a low - mass x - ray binary , can be described by a multicolour blackbody spectrum . due to the integration time of @xmath91 , short term",
    "spectral changes like quasi - periodic oscillations average out .",
    "long term variabilities either happen on significantly longer time scales compared to the data taking , or they affect energies outside hete-2 s sensitivity interval .",
    "determining the average attenuation length by a photon flux weighted integral with tabulated values for the attenuation length yielded @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the spectrum of _ scorpius x-1 _ is much softer compared to the previous case .",
    "the background subtracted images oconsisted roughly of @xmath57 photons .",
    "the analysis [ ana : mc ] is repeated for the _ scorpius x-1 _ dataset . for each pointing @xmath69 and @xmath71",
    "have been derived .",
    "figure [ fig : scodata_depend ] illustrates the accuracy of the source localisation algorithm .",
    "again , the values @xmath69 with their errors @xmath71 are shown as a function of angle of incidence @xmath67 .    the average quadratic deviation from zero has been determined to @xmath93 which is slightly larger than in the previous case , but reflects inaccuracies in the satellite pointing .",
    "furthermore , this value is probably underestimated because of the incomplete sampling of the field of view .",
    "the statistical error is marginally smaller due to larger photon numbers and has been derived to be @xmath94 .",
    "figure [ fig : scodata_spot ] shows the combined localisation in @xmath12- and @xmath13-direction , converted into the celestial coordinate frame .",
    "the radius of the spot is @xmath95 .",
    "the average attenuation length @xmath40 has been varied to yield the minimum value for @xmath82 . in the case of _",
    "scorpius x-1 _ , we find the optimum value to be @xmath96 , which corresponds well to the theoretically expected value @xmath92 .",
    "in order to assess the extend to which angular resolving power is affected by the source localisation algorithm , the point spread function of the imaging system has been derived . for a coded mask camera like _ wxm _ ,",
    "the point spread function is equal to the autocorrelation @xmath97 of the mask pattern @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath98(x)$ ] . to be exact , @xmath97 describes the isotropised point spread function .",
    "anisotropies provoke asymmetries in the central correlation peak of the function @xmath99(x)$ ] .",
    "again , the determination of @xmath97 is carried out in fourier - space .",
    "diagram [ dia : psf ] illustrates the derivation of @xmath100 $ ] :    @xmath101      the width @xmath102 of the autocorrelation function @xmath97 has been determined by fitting a gaussian to the central peak .",
    "the average width @xmath103 of the point spread function has been defined as the geometric mean of its extend in @xmath12- and @xmath13-direction ( @xmath104 ) , because the quantity of interest is the size of the spot a source is imaged onto .",
    "the value of @xmath97 at the origin corresponds to the correlation strength @xmath105 .",
    "accordingly , the average correlation strength @xmath106 has been defined to be equal to the arithmetic mean of @xmath105 and @xmath107 because of its analogy to brightness .",
    "the angles of incidence have been restricted to @xmath108 , in order to ensure that the mask pattern is fully imaged onto the detector .",
    "the source positions were arranged on a square lattice with mesh size of @xmath109 .",
    "the average attenuation length @xmath40 has been set to , corresponding to a power law spectrum with spectral index @xmath32 .",
    "the left plot in figure [ fig : psf ] illustrates , that the width @xmath103 of the autocorrelation function increases and how the correlation strength decreases correspondingly at larger distances from the optical axis . at increasingly larger distance from the optical axis , the functions @xmath33 and @xmath110 disperse the correlation peak .",
    "because the area underneath the peak has to be conserved , the correlation strength @xmath106 drops accordingly .",
    "thus , the angular resolution power has decreased thus by @xmath111 for a burst at @xmath112 compared to a burst on the optical axis .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
