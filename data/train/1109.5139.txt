    "in einstein - hilbert gravity coupled to various matter fields , the exterior geometry of a 3 + 1 dimensional asymptotically flat black hole ( bh ) spacetime typically approaches a stationary solution at late times .",
    "non - stationary perturbations decay both by falling across the horizon and dispersing to infinity , as described by the ringdown of quasi - normal modes followed by power - law tails .",
    "our purpose here is to explore a corresponding late - time limit of the associated black hole interiors .",
    "we will argue that as far as the observations of late - infalling physical observers are considered , the result is well - described by a simple effective geometry which contains the part of the corresponding stationary bh solution to the past of the inner horizon .",
    "however , the regular inner horizon is replaced by singular components of two different types : ( i ) the _ ingoing _ section of the inner horizon  the cauchy horizon ( ch)is replaced by a null , weak , curvature singularity , and ( ii ) the _ outgoing _ section of the inner horizon is replaced by an outgoing shock - wave singularity .",
    "the presence of a null , weak , curvature singularity at the ch is a well - known phenomenon since the pioneering works of hiscock on the reissner - nordstrom - vaidya solution @xcite and of poisson and israel on the mass - inflation model @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is the second singular component ",
    "the outgoing shock - wave singularity  which will be our main concern in this paper . our study is motivated in part by the picture of extreme black holes at late times suggested in @xcite and explored further in @xcite .",
    "this picture agrees with the extreme limit of our results below .",
    "the starting point for our analysis is the large body of literature studying perturbations of the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) and kerr interiors . with the assumption of spherical symmetry",
    ", these works establish that perturbations transform at least the initial part of the ingoing inner horizon ( the ch ) of rn into a null curvature singularity often called the mass - inflation singularity .",
    "this singularity is weak in the sense that the metric remains continuous at the singularity , though it is not differentiable . in particular , the area - radius @xmath0 of the spheres is well - defined at this singularity , taking the value @xmath1 near the point marked @xmath2 on the conformal diagram shown in figure [ summary ] ( left ) and shrinking toward the future as described by the raychaudhuri equation , eventually reaching @xmath3 . in the spherical case , at least when the matter content includes a minimally - coupled massless scalar field , it was numerically established @xcite that when @xmath0 shrinks to zero the weak null singularity meets a strong spacelike singularity these numerical simulations showed that a transition from a null to a spacelike singularity occurs in a region which ( when mapped to a collapsing - shell spacetime ) would correspond to being _ outside _ the shell ( i.e. where the electric field is non - zero ) .",
    "however , when the initial scalar perturbations are sufficiently weak , the full focussing of the ch to @xmath3 will only occur inside the shell .",
    "we strongly expect the formation of a spacelike singularity in this case as well , and have drawn this scenario in figure [ summary ] .",

    "this situation is depicted in the left panel of figure [ summary ] .",
    "note that curvature scalars diverge at both the above spacelike and null singularities .",
    "while the establishment of a spacelike singularity is less certain for other forms of matter ( e.g. perfect fluids ) , it is nevertheless expected that all future - directed timelike and null curves inside the black hole will be incomplete due to reaching a curvature singularity of some form .",
    "investigations of nonlinearly - perturbed spinning bhs reveal a similar scenario .",
    "perturbative analyses @xcite again indicate the formation of a null weak scalar - curvature singularity at the ch ( though this time the singularity is generically oscillatory @xcite , as opposed to the monotonic mass - inflation singularity in the spherical case ) .",
    "the presence of such a null singularity is also supported by an asymptotic local analysis of the einstein equations @xcite , as well as by exact analytical constructions of locally - generic classes of null weak singularity @xcite . yet , to the best of our knowledge , no numerical verification of this scenario has yet been carried out in the spinning case .     *",

    "however , the detailed experiences of any given observer inside such a black hole will in general depend on the process by which the black hole was formed and on the particular perturbations generated .",
    "in contrast , we argue below that the spacetime effectively simplifies from the point of view of observers who enter the black hole at late times , which we call late infall - time ( or just late - infall ) observers .",
    "the simplified spacetime may be described by the simple , stationary bh solution up to the inner horizon  and an effective outgoing shock wave at the outgoing portion of the latter ( plus a null weak singularity at the ch ) .",

    "recall that perturbations outside the bh decay at late time , where of course late means relative to the formation of the black hole and the onset of any significant new perturbations .",
    "therefore , for observers who fall into the bh at sufficiently late time , the exterior geometry will be well approximated by the stationary ( and axially - symmetric ) bh metric .",
    "this allows one to associate specific values of energy @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and angular momentum @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) to the late - time geodesics . more importantly ,",
    "owing to the approximate time - translation of the external geometry , from any  seed \" infalling geodesic @xmath10 , we may construct a one - parameter family @xmath11 of similar geodesics , obtained from @xmath10 by time translation to the future .",
    "( we emphasize that in the present construction the members of @xmath11 are _ exactly _ geodesics , all related to @xmath10 by the approximate time translation .",

    "now , each member of @xmath11 is characterized by the parameter @xmath19 , namely the value of the advanced time @xmath20 ( eddington s advanced null coordinate ) at which the geodesic crosses the event horizon .",
    "for any given seed geodesic @xmath10 , the _ late - infall observers _ are those members of @xmath11 characterized by sufficiently large values of @xmath19 .",
    "our main objective in this paper is to characterize the experience of such late  infall observers who move toward the outgoing section of the inner horizon in a generically - perturbed charged ( or spinning ) bh .",
    "we shall see that such observers experience abrupt changes in the amplitude of various perturbing fields  as well as the metric itself  while crossing the ( would - be ) inner horizon .",
    "these changes occur within a short proper - time interval whose magnitude decreases exponentially with the infall time @xmath19 . for an observer with fixed resolution and sufficiently large @xmath19 this proper - time interval",
    "is so tiny that he experiences the perturbation as an effective shock wave .",
    "the above - mentioned concept of late - infall observers may be generalized , and reformulated in a somewhat more precise manner ( though we will not attempt a fully precise definition here ) .",
    "consider a continuous one - parameter family of inextendible causal curves labeled by the advanced time @xmath19 at which they cross the event horizon , with @xmath19 taking values in some range @xmath21 so that the family includes curves that enter the black hole at arbitrarily late times . note that since perturbations outside the black hole decay , the advanced time @xmath20 can indeed be used as a coordinate along the horizon at sufficiently late times .",
    "we require that , in the limit @xmath22 , the part of these curves to the past of the event horizon approaches a _",
    "stationary _ family of such curves in some stationary spacetime ; i.e. for which curves with different values of @xmath19 are related by the corresponding time - translation .",
    "we further require that , for large @xmath19 , the parts of our curves to the future of the event horizon all have the same proper accelerations when expressed using a reference frame parallel - propagated along the world line in terms of the proper time along the worldline after crossing the event horizon .",
    "one may think of this as the assumption that all observers in a given family are equipped with identically pre - programmed rocket ships .",
    "of course we insist that these reference frames at the event horizon are also related by an approximate time translation at large @xmath19 . for our rather qualitative purposes below it",
    "will not be necessary to specify the precise rate at which these limiting behaviors are approached , though some such specification will certainly be needed to derive more precise results .    after a brief review of charged spherical black holes in section [ preliminaries ] , we study the experiences of late - time observers in stationary spacetimes subject to linear perturbations in section [ perturbations ] .",
    "such observers experience no perturbation at all until they would expect to encounter an inner horizon .",
    "however , they effectively encounter a shockwave at the outgoing inner horizon .",
    "while we include a discussion of linearly perturbed kerr black holes , our treatment mainly focuses on the simpler spherically symmetric case .",

    "we show that the experiences of freely - falling late - time observers again agree with those in unperturbed reissner - nordstrm up to the point where they would expect to encounter the ( outgoing section of the ) inner horizon .",
    "however , instead of finding a smooth null surface at that point , they effectively encounter a gravitational shockwave at which the metric is discontinuous .",
    "section [ latet ] then gives a heuristic argument that the experiences of more general late - time observers are similar , and in particular that they are described by the effective spacetime shown in the right panel of figure [ summary ] .",
    "the final discussion in section [ disc ] describes possible generalizations to rotating black holes and to black holes in any dimensions and the implications for finite - time observers who fall into astrophysical black holes .",

    "we conclude that any accelerated late infall - time observer who  would have reached the outgoing inner horizon in unperturbed rn \" also experiences a shockwave in the perturbed spacetime .",
    "we have seen above that , in the limit of late infall times , observers who enter a perturbed reissner - nordstrm black hole experience an effectively unperturbed reissner - nordstrm geometry up to the point where they would expect to encounter an inner horizon at @xmath5 . at this point",

    "the ingoing worldline will reach the weak null singularity , which is also a curvature singularity . ] .",
    "in addition , it is clear that some accelerated observers will reach the ingoing weak null singularity shown in figure [ summary ] ( left ) . for observers who enter the black hole very late , in the region where perturbations are very small",
    ", this may be accomplished using roughly the same set of accelerations ( as defined in their own reference frame ) as would be required to reach the ingoing part of the inner horizon in an unperturbed rn black hole .",
    "furthermore , in the limit of late infall times , such observers arrive at the portion of the weak null singularity close to @xmath2 in figure [ summary ] where the singularity is extremely weak , so that again such observers will measure no noticeable departure from unperturbed rn until @xmath0 is exceedingly close to @xmath31 .    to compliment the precise calculations of sections [ linear ] and [ non - linear ] , we find it useful to give a brief heuristic argument that reinforces the above statements . to do so , note that taking our observer to enter the black hole at late times is equivalent to considering some fixed infall time and replacing the given spacetime with one in which the black hole formed ( along with its full set of perturbations ) at a much earlier time .",
    "as a particular example , we might consider a scenario which starts with empty minkowski space in the interior and where both the matter that forms the black hole and our observer are dropped in from some large value of @xmath0 at finite advanced times @xmath347 and @xmath348 respectively .",
    "for example , the observer might be ejected from a static space station .",
    "the matter could be dropped from a dense network of such space stations , or simply assumed to cross the @xmath0-coordiante associated with the observer s space station near the advanced time @xmath347 .",
    "the observer is also given some particular instructions for executing accelerations as a function of proper time along his worldline and we take the matter to be released as some particular function of advanced time peaked around some @xmath347 . allowing @xmath347 to vary leads to a one - parameter family of ( isometric ) spacetimes .",
    "we wish to study the limit @xmath349 holding @xmath348 fixed .",
    "it is useful to assume that the perturbed spacetime preserves spherical symmetry .",

    "furthermore , it is clear that two spacetimes differing by a shift of @xmath347 can be described by essentially the same metric functions , albeit again with a corresponding shift of @xmath350 .",

    "the metric undergoes a discontinuity and changes by a finite amount in vanishing time .",
    "an extended physical object hitting this shockwave will thus undergo a sudden deformation ( i.e. shear and/or contraction ) , by a finite amount , within an effectively - vanishing proper time .",
    "owing to their short time scale , the gravitational tidal forces entailed in the shock will presumably dominate over all internal interactions .",
    "thus , each single nucleon ( say ) will be deformed by a certain amount ( typically of order 1 ) while traversing such a shock - wave .",
    "we also gave a heuristic argument that the experiences of late - time observers are described by the simple effective spacetime shown at right in figure [ pertt ] , which in particular reproduces the above exact results .",
    "on the basis of this argument one expects the outgoing shockwave to contain a strong curvature singularity . ] , with the area - radius @xmath0 shrinking to zero across the shockwave for the case described in figure [ pertt ] .",
    "however , these final details remain to be verified by other techniques .",
    "while the explicit non - linear analysis in section [ non - linear ] was restricted to the spherically - symmetric case , we strongly expect that the same phenomenon of shockwave formation will take place in nonspherical black holes as well , and particularly in perturbed spinning black holes .",
    "this expectation is based on the combination of several pieces of evidence : the experience of late - infall observers inside a linearly - perturbed kerr bh ( discussed in section [ linear ] ) , the sub - dominance of nonlinear perturbations in generically - perturbed spinning black holes ( particularly near the early portion of the ch ) , and  more generally  on the profound similarity between the inner structures of charged and spinning black holes",
    ".    it may be interesting to compare the properties of the two different types of null singularity that develop at the inner horizon : the shock - wave singularity at the latter s outgoing section , and the weak curvature singularity at the ch .",
    "we argue that from the physical point of view the shock - wave singularity is the more violent one  particularly for very late - infalling observers . to see this , consider two representative orbits in the rn geometry : orbit ( a ) hits the ingoing section of @xmath5 , whereas orbit ( b ) hits the latter s outgoing section .",
    "let us now consider the experiences of these two observers on their approach to @xmath5 , in case the rn spacetime is perturbed  focussing our attention on the late - infall orbits belonging to the two families ( a , b ) .",
    "observers of type ( a ) will hit a true curvature singularity at the ch .",
    "this singularity is weak , however , and any observer will only experience a finite integrated deformation up to the ch .",
    "furthermore , this deformation will decrease with increasing @xmath19 ( as an inverse power thereof ) , and will vanish in the late - infall limit . on the other hand , observers of type ( b ) will experience , on approaching @xmath5 , a certain amount of deformation which does _ not _ decrease with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "this is because the shock s amplitude approaches a certain limiting value at large @xmath19 ( it is only the shock s width which evolves at late time , it decreases exponentially in @xmath19 ) .",
    "thus , at least as far as the overall tidal deformation is considered , at the late - infall limit observers of type ( a ) will effectively feel no singularity at the ch , whereas late - infall observers of type ( b ) will feel a violent gravitational shock - wave singularity , whose magnitude is typically of order unity ( at least ) .    while our considerations were completely classical , our conclusions also suggest properties of quantum black hole microstates . in particular , the second law of thermodynamics implies that the late - time limit of any black hole spacetime should approximate the typical quantum state of the relevant ensemble .",
    "it is thus natural to conjecture that the typical state in an ensemble of charged or rotating black holes corresponds to the geometry displayed in figure [ pertt ] ( right ) together with quantum corrections , as opposed to say that shown in [ pertt ] ( left ) .",
    "some of our results carry over directly to generic ( stable ) black holes in any dimension .",
    "indeed , in retrospect our linear analysis depended only on the general form of a ( future - directed ) time - translation @xmath374 between the inner and outer horizons of the unperturbed black hole , and in particular on the pattern of surfaces invariant under its action .",
    "the essential ingredients are just that : i ) the ( smooth ) inner and outer horizons are invariant under @xmath374 , ii ) the point @xmath375 in figure [ rnfig ] ( left ) is an attractive fixed point of @xmath374 while @xmath376 is a repulsive fixed point , and iii ) perturbations in the immediate vicinity of the outgoing inner - horizon decouple into independent @xmath46 and @xmath20 components and taking the limit @xmath377 to zoom in on the region near @xmath244 .",
    "corresponding results may also hold for higher spin fields . ] .",
    "whenever these features arise , late infall - time observers who reach the outgoing inner horizon will experience any given linear perturbation as a shockwave .",
    "note that , despite our use of eddington coordinates @xmath350 in the main text , this more geometric form of the argument is manifestly coordinate invariant .",
    "at the non - linear level , the assumption that the perturbed spacetime approaches a stationary geometry at @xmath375 which is an attractive fixed point of @xmath374 again implies that late infall - time observers experience an essentially unperturbed solution up to the point where they would expect to reach an inner horizon .",
    "one is tempted to draw a conformal diagram similar to that in figure [ pertt ] ( right ) and again conjecture that infalling observers experience an effective outgoing shockwave . however , investigating this conjecture in detail will require more sophisticated methods or , perhaps , numerical simulations .    throughout this work",
    "we have considered what one may call ` test observers , ' which experience perturbations of the spacetime but do not source further perturbations .",
    "in contrast , any physical observer who falls into the black hole may be expected to create additional perturbations which now typically fall into the black hole at an advanced time comparable to @xmath19 ( and thus which can not generally be ignored simply by taking the limit of large @xmath19 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to understand what this implies for the experiences of such physical observers .",
    "for example , consider an observer who reaches the would - be ingoing inner horizon ( the ch ) . due to the decay of other perturbations",
    "as reviewed in section [ non - linear_metric ] , for sufficiently large @xmath19 the perturbations at the relevant part of the ch will generically be dominated by those sourced by our observer himself .",
    "one would expect him to encounter a null weak singularity whose strength ( typically tiny , of order the mass ratio between the bh and observer ) is determined by perturbations of his own creation .",
    "in contrast , even if our observer instead reaches the would - be outgoing inner horizon , we see no reason for perturbations sourced by the observer to destroy the outgoing shock wave set up by earlier perturbations or to significantly change the experience described above .    in our work",
    "above , we assumed that the spacetime approaches some non - extreme stationary black hole geometry near @xmath2 . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we assumed `` generic '' parameter values for this limiting bh , and in particular that it is not too close to extremality . while extending these results to nearly - extreme black holes",
    "is not difficult ( see in particular footnote [ extend ] in appendix a ) , it remains to understand the precisely extreme case .",
    "taking the formal extreme limit of our late - time results ( i.e. , first taking @xmath22 with @xmath378 and then taking @xmath379 ) agrees with the picture suggested in @xcite ( and supported by @xcite ) in which late - time observers experience a singularity which effectively resides at the final event horizon .",
    "this suggests that such a picture should hold at least for horizons that approach extremality sufficiently slowly relative to the production of perturbations ( and relative to the time scale set by the surface gravity ) .",
    "this in particular should apply for large black holes when the approach to extremality is due to quantum processes in cases where the extreme bh is quantum mechanically stable ( e.g. , with enough supersymmetry ) .",
    "however , a complete analysis is again left for future work .    to simplify the discussion",
    ", our analysis has focussed on very late time observers who enter asymptotically flat black holes . but",
    "let us now comment on the implications for observers who enter astrophysical black holes at finite times .",
    "so long as the current accretion rate and any effects from the expansion of the universe are small ( e.g , at the 1% level ) , and so long as a few light - crossing times have passed since the black hole experienced a large perturbation ( including the initial formation of the black hole ) , a finite infall - time observer who reaches the would - be outgoing inner horizon should also experience our effective shock wave .",
    "this can be seen from the following points : ( i ) by causality , nothing that enters the black hole more than a few light - crossing times to the future of our observer can affect his experience .",
    "thus the experience of our observer can be described by modeling the astrophysical black hole as an asymptotically flat black hole with a small accretion rate .",
    "( ii ) although in various parts of this paper we have focused on the internal structure of the bh at very late time ( after the decay of radiative tails ) , one should bear in mind that the process of shock formation is in fact rather quick : owing to the exponential decrease of the shock width , a @xmath19 value of only a few light - crossing times is required for the very narrow shock configuration to build up . during such a @xmath19 interval of ,",
    "say , 10 - 20 times @xmath56 , a weak accretion will not have a chance to cause a significant modification to the process of shock formation .    for observers who fall into such an accreting bh with a much larger @xmath19",
    ", the accumulating effects of continuing accretion may possibly be more significant ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the limit of weak accretion , any effects of this accretion can cause only small changes from the scenario described above . while this might give our effective shock a finite width ( independent of @xmath19 ) or perhaps make the effective shock timelike or spacelike instead of null , in the weak accretion limit observers with fixed resolution would still describe their experience as an encounter with an effective shock .",
    "thus our scenario provides a good first approximation to the experiences of observers who enter weakly - accreting astrophysical black holes at finite times . while it would be interesting to compute these corrections quantitatively ( e.g. by comparing with @xcite ) , the fact that in many astrophysical situations the mass accretion rate is far , far less than @xmath56 per light crossing time seconds .",
    "even if such a black hole accreted a solar mass per year , we would have @xmath380 . ]",
    "suggests that this approximation is quite good indeed .",
