    "the outer part of the nebula around @xmath0 carinae contains a countless number of knots , bullets and filaments and manifests the so - called outer ejecta ( diameter 60  or 0.67pc ) . a kinematic analysis using high - resolution echelle spectra showed that the outer ejecta expand with velocities between @xmath2  and + 600  on average ( e.g.  meaburn et al .",

    "various filaments nevertheless show much higher radial velocities  e.g .",

    "it is still unclear what triggered the outburst in 1843 and which mechanism not only formed @xmath0 carinae s nebula but also the amazingly high expansion velocities . with velocities that high , x - ray emission from @xmath0 carinae",

    "with rosat and chandra we are now able to separate between a harder , nearly point like emission from the central source and an extended softer emission from @xmath0 carinae s outer ejecta which is roughly hook shaped ( e.g.  weis et al .",
    "interestingly , an overlay of the optical image and the x - ray emission shows only a few correlations between the optically emitting gas and the hot x - ray gas , see fig .",
    "1 . a much stronger conformance was found in comparison with the radial expansion velocities .",
    "the expansion velocities are derived from our optical echelle spectra ( fwhm@xmath314 ) and overplotted in fig.1 with negative velocities underlined .",
    "areas with higher x - ray emission show in general higher expansion velocities .",
    "the faster the gas is expanding the more intense is the x - ray emission .",
    "the extended soft x - ray emission from @xmath0 carinae and especially the morphology of the x - ray nebula can therefore be explained by faster moving filaments which form x - ray emitting shocks .",
