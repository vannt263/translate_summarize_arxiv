    "one of the main technical differences between rfdes and ordinary differential equations ( odes ) is that while odes require initial data only at one point ( typically at time @xmath1 ) to generate a solution , rfdes require initial data in a range of past values , typically an interval @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "one of the consequences of this fact is that the phase space for rfdes is infinite - dimensional . despite this fact ,",
    "most of the usual tools and techniques of the theory of dynamical systems can be suitably adapted to the study of rfdes @xcite .",
    "in particular , for parametrized rfdes , one can analyze bifurcations using center manifold theory and normal forms @xcite , and in many studies ( see for example @xcite ) , this has led to valuable insight into many phenomena which are modeld using rfdes .",

    "endemic bubbles_. it became apparent to us that the bifurcation diagrams reported in @xcite resembled bifurcation diagrams which had been found to be in the versal unfolding of the degenerate hopf bifurcation ( with crossing condition violated ) in @xcite .",
    "although this sis model is the application which motivated our analysis , the theoretical results we present here have a much larger scope of application , since many phenomena in nature are modelled using the class of delay differential equations we study .",

    "as we will show in this paper , the endemic bubble is indeed a consequence of a degenerate hopf bifurcation which occurs in ( [ sis ] ) for various choices of response functions @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is some auxiliary parameter which appears in the behavioral response function .      with the above discussion in mind",
    ", this suggests that the organizing center of endemic bubbles is a degenerate hopf bifurcation in ( [ sis ] ) . in this paper",

    "our approach will be to use the center manifold and normal form theory for rfdes developed in @xcite and the classification and unfolding of degenerate hopf bifurcations of @xcite .",
    "ours is not the first study of higher codimension bifurcation in rfdes with nonlinear degeneracies .",
    "we note in particular @xcite where the authors present and analyze a dde model for tumor growth in which a bautin bifurcation ( hopf bifurcation with the first lyapunov coefficient being zero ) occurs . in @xcite ,",
    "a maple program is presented which allows the computation of coefficients up to any order related to hopf bifurcation for rfdes .",
    "also , in @xcite , the authors investigate the stabilization of unstable periodic orbits via the pyragas delayed feedback control .",
    "it is shown that the stabilization mechanism occurs because of a highly degenerate hopf bifurcation in which both crossing condition and first lyapunov coefficient degeneracy occur simultaneously .",
    "our paper here appears to be the first systematic study of the degeneracy resulting from the violation of the crossing condition in the hopf bifurcation theorem for general rfdes .    in section 2",
    ", we will establish the sufficient conditions for such a degenerate hopf bifurcation to occur in a general class of parametrized rfdes .",
    "our main theorems to that effect are theorems [ mainthm23 ] and [ thmmain ] . in subsection 2.3",
