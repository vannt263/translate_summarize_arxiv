    "numerical simulations of galaxy evolution require basic physical input regarding the ( thermo-)dynamical behavior of the interstellar gas",
    ". a crucial ingredient of the energy , or entropy , equation is the cooling rate of the gas .",
    "this quantity is , in principle , a complex function of the temperature , composition , and irradiation of the gas .",
    "an often used assumption is that the gas is in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) . in that case ,",
    "collisions with free electrons are deemed solely responsible for keeping atoms ionized .",
    "since both the recombination rate and the ionization rate are in that case directly proportional to the electron density , the latter cancels from the equations and the ionization equilibrium becomes a function of temperature only ( for a given elemental abundance mix ) . for low gas densities , each collisional ionization / excitation",
    "is followed by a radiative de - excitation , creating an escaping photon , and the cooling rate becomes proportional to the density squared ( or to hydrogen density times electron density , @xmath4 ) times a temperature - dependent function .",
    "many state - of - the - art simulation codes @xcite rely on the cooling curves compiled by @xcite .",
    "the latter authors calculated cooling rates , excluding a forefactor @xmath4 , as a function of temperature for a number of metallicities . during a simulation , the cooling rate of a gas parcel can be rapidly determined by simple two - dimensional interpolation on these curves . however , while this work was monumental and has spawned a large volume of literature based on simulations making use of these curves , one needs to be aware of the assumptions on which these cooling curves are based and simulators need to assess whether they can be used for the application at hand . to be clear :",
    "this is no criticism of the @xcite cooling curves .",
    "* metallicity is quantified using [ fe / h ] , the iron abundance . for [ fe / h]@xmath5",
    "the abundance ratios are taken to reflect those of a snii , with [ @xmath6/fe]@xmath7 ; for [ fe / h]@xmath8 the solar abundance ratios are adopted , with [ @xmath6/fe]@xmath8 ; for other metallicities , the abundance ratios are interpolated linearly between these two sets of abundance ratios . hence",
    ", _ adopting the @xcite cooling curves immediately implies adopting the solar neighborhood s chemical enrichment history .",
    "_ in some cases , this may not be a good approximation of reality .",
    "e.g. , dwarf galaxies have low metallicities but also low [ @xmath6/fe ] ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein )",
    ". using the low - metallicity @xcite cooling curves will then quite strongly overestimate the cooling contributed by @xmath6-elements such as o , si , and mg .",
    "the centers of giant elliptical galaxies , on the other hand , have high metallicities and high [ @xmath6/fe ] @xcite . with the @xcite cooling curves",
    ", the contribution of the @xmath6 elements will be strongly underestimated . *",
    "another issue is whether in the presence of a cosmological uv background ( uvb ) cie is still an acceptable approximation .",
    "the uvb tends to keep ( part of ) the hydrogen and metals ionized , thus lowering the fraction of hi and raising @xmath9 .",
    "this dramatically influences the shape of the cooling curve , as is well known @xcite and as we will also show below .",
    "@xcite compared the net cooling rates computed assuming only cie with those calculated including photo - ionization .",
    "these authors showed that the equilibrium temperature of the gas could be off by an order of magnitude at low densities and high metallicities when using cie .",
    "* simulations nowadays achieve sufficiently high spatial resolution to be able to follow the formation of cold , dense star - forming clouds .",
    "this requires extending the @xcite cooling curves to temperatures below @xmath10  k. an often used extension is the set of cooling curves of @xcite .",
    "these authors calculate the level populations of feii , oi , siii , and cii and the cooling rates due to the low - lying finestructure emission lines of these ions .",
    "these level populations are set by collisions with free electrons and thus by the ionization fraction of the gas .",
    "again , this is a quantity which is very sensitive to the presence of a cosmic uvb . clearly , the often used approach of `` gluing '' the @xcite cooling curves ( @xmath0  k@xmath11  k ) to the @xcite cooling curves ( @xmath10  k@xmath12  k ) will produce unreliable results in simulations with a cosmic uvb .",
    "recent calculations of cooling curves with cloudy , such as @xcite ( used in the overwhelmingly large simulations project @xcite ) and @xcite ( used in the simulation code gasoline @xcite ) , include the cosmic uvb in determining the ionization balance . here ,",
    "the total cooling rate is written as the sum of approximately independent terms :  the cooling due to h and he , the cooling due to metals , and inverse compton cooling .",
    "@xcite advocate an element - by - element approach , necessitating the tracing of the abundances of a set of 11 elements during a simulation in order to calculate the independent contribution of each to the total cooling rate . in reality , these terms are linked by the free electron density , by charge - exchange reactions , and by other reactions between different elements ( such as molecule and dust particle formation ) . moreover",
    ", many authors still adopt the solar abundance ratios and scale the metal cooling rate proportional to metallicity which , as we have argued , can be expected to be a bad representation of reality for certain types of stellar systems .",
    "likewise , @xcite , and @xcite only provide cooling curves for solar abundance ratios of the heavy elements ( h and he ions are followed explicitly during simulations ) . in the former paper ,",
    "the influence of the uvb is not taken into account while the latter focuses precisely on this issue .",
    "@xcite incorporate the radiation field through four well - chosen normalized photoionization rates .",
    "this , together with a taylor expansion of the curves up to quadratic terms in metallicity , yields an approximation to the cooling and heating curves with a median error of 10  % but with ( although very rare ) errors of up to a factor of six .    in this paper",
    ", we try to improve on several aspects of the existing cooling curve calculations .",
    "below , we give a list of the most prominent ingredients of our calculations :    * we adopt a chemical enrichment model that is self - consistent in the sense that , in an @xmath13-body / sph simulation , gas particles can be enriched by stellar particles in only two ways :  fast ( by snii and massive intermediate - mass stars ( ims ) , with @xmath14  m@xmath15 ) and slow ( by snia and less massive ims ) .",
    "thus , the chemical abundance mix of a gas particle depends solely on the ratio of the `` slow '' and `` fast '' contributions .",
    "the cooling and heating rates can then be tabulated for a small number of different ratios of `` slow '' to `` fast '' contributions , covering all possibilities that can occur in a simulation . + snii yields are taken from @xcite and modified according to the prescriptions detailed in @xcite ; ims yields come from @xcite ; snia yields have been adopted from @xcite . for snii ,",
    "the fraction of the initial mass of a stellar population that is returned in the form of element @xmath16 to the interstellar medium ( ism ) is given by @xmath17 here , @xmath18",
    "m@xmath15 and @xmath19  m@xmath15 are the lower and upper bounds of the masses of stars that turn into snii ; @xmath20  m@xmath15 and @xmath21  m@xmath15 are the adopted lower and upper bounds of the masses of stars .",
    "the mass returned in the form of element @xmath16 by a star with initial mass @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath23 . for the initial - mass function , or imf , denoted by @xmath24",
    ", we take the parameterization by @xcite .",
    "+ for snia , the fraction of the initial mass of a stellar population that is returned in the form of element @xmath16 to the ism is given by @xmath25 here , @xmath26",
    "m@xmath15 is the lower bound of the masses of stars that can turn into snia and @xmath27 is the snia yield of element @xmath16 .",
    "the forefactor @xmath28 was determined by demanding that the calculated ratio of the occurrence of sn ia to that of snii reproduces that derived for the solar neighborhood by @xcite : @xmath29 + for ims , the yield is given analogously by @xmath30 with @xmath31  m@xmath15 and @xmath32  m@xmath15 .",
    "the yields of elements contributed by the most massive ims , such as @xmath33c and n , are added to the corresponding snii yields .",
    "those of elements produced by longer - lived stars are added to the corresponding snia yields .",
    "this way , there are two contributions to the yield of a given element :  a `` fast '' one ( encompassing the contributions from snii and massive ims ) and a `` slow '' one ( encompassing the contributions from snia and less massive ims ) .",
    "the abundance of each chemical element in a gas parcel is then simply the weighted sum of these two contributions .",
    "+    o & 0.000136 & 0.000937 + c & 0.000146 & 0.000143 + ne & 2.41e-05 & 0.00013 + mg & 1.06e-05 & 6.23e-05 + si & 1.66e-05 & 4.89e-05 + fe & 2.96e-05 & 1.67e-05 + s & 9.15e-06 & 1.41e-05 + n & 5.87e-05 & 9.65e-06 + al & 6.46e-08 & 6.51e-06 + na & 4.86e-09 & 3.36e-06 + ni & 2.99e-07 & 1.67e-06 + ca & 9.99e-07 & 1.64e-06 + + since this simple chemical evolution model contains two sets of yields , the elemental abundance ratios in a given gas parcel can also be quantified by just two numbers . here , we choose [ fe / h ] as a tracer of the overall metallicity and [ mg / fe ] as a second parameter .",
    "mg is an @xmath6-element released abundantly by sn ii explosions but produced in only very small amounts by sn ia explosions so it is a good tracer of the relative weights of the `` fast '' and `` slow '' contributions .",
    "moreover , there are now quite advanced techniques available to determine the abundances of both fe and mg in a stellar population from absorption lines in optical spectra .",
    "obviously , oxygen would also make a good discriminator between the `` fast '' and `` slow '' contributions .",
    "we present the element yields used in this paper , expressed as a fraction of the initial mass of a single stellar population , in table [ tab : yields ] . + in fig .",
    "[ fig : compsun ] , we compare the observed abundances of a number of well - studied stars , taken from @xcite , with those predicted by our chemical evolution model for the appropriate [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] values . for the sun and arcturus ,",
    "the largest discrepancies are about @xmath34  dex . for sirius and vega ,",
    "there are larger deviations between data and model , although the author - to - author scatter on the measured abundances of these stars is , admittedly , quite substantive ( e.g. the na abundance in the atmosphere of sirius varies by more than one dex between different authors , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "taking into account observational uncertainties and genuine cosmic scatter , this is reassuring evidence that the simple two - yield chemical evolution model employed here works adequately . *",
    "the ionization balance , electron density , level populations , and cooling rates are calculated self - consistently in the presence of a cosmic uvb . here",
    ", we adopt the uvb calculated by @xcite .",
    "we use the uv spectra available from this author s webpagecgiguere / uvb.html ] to calculate the ionization and heating rates of all elements . *",
    "stars also generate an interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , capable of ionizing atoms with small ionizing potentials , such as ci , sii , mgi , cai , caii , fei , etc . even at very low gas temperatures .",
    "since the light of newly formed stars had to make its way through the hii regions surrounding these stars , it no longer has an h - ionizing component .",
    "we include the parameterized isrf of @xcite , appropriate for the solar neighborhood .",
    "the isrf s main task is to keep the elements mentioned above ionized while its precise form has shown to be of little consequence . at low gas densities ,",
    "the uvb is the dominant photo - ionizing radiation field while at high densities , where star formation becomes important and neutral hydrogen can shield the gas from the uvb , the isrf gains importance . * through hydrogen ionizations and cascade recombinations ,",
    "the h - ionizing portion of diffuse uv radiation impacting on a gas cloud is converted into lower - frequency radiation .",
    "thus , for sufficiently high densities , gas may become self - shielding against h - ionizing uv radiation once hydrogen recombines .",
    "therefore , self - shielding will generally be insignificant for temperatures @xmath35  k since then hydrogen is collisionally ionized anyway .",
    "+ this is not a straightforward problem since it in principle requires solving the radiative transfer equation .",
    "however , one can estimate the critical h density above which self - shielding can be expected to block most of the ionizing uv radiation .",
    "@xcite put forward @xmath36  @xmath2 , @xcite estimate that @xmath37  @xmath2 , and @xcite quote @xmath38  @xmath2 . with this cut - off density , it is possible to reproduce the observed mass- and volume - averaged neutral fraction of the universe at a redshift @xmath39 @xcite , the hi column density distribution of damped ly@xmath6 systems @xmath40 @xcite , and the ly@xmath6 luminosity of forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "+ we have implemented an approximate scheme for self - shielding by exponentially suppressing the uv radiation field with frequencies above @xmath41 , with @xmath42 the hydrogen ionization potential , as @xmath43 with @xmath3  @xmath2 and @xmath44 the original uv spectrum , as in @xcite . note that we use",
    "the _ neutral _ h density here , not the _ total _ h density , since it is only the neutral fraction which is responsible for absorbing h - ionizing uv radiation .",
    "+ one could worry that , when the gas at high densities and low temperatures becomes self - shielding against the external uvb , the cooling radiation itself may become trapped and be re - absorbed , affecting the cooling rate and the ionization equilibrium @xcite .",
    "however , in a self - shielding hi cloud below @xmath45  k , only low - energy uv photons unable to photo - heat the hydrogen gas are emitted . moreover , with most of the star - formation prescriptions currently popular in galaxy evolution and cosmological simulations @xcite , such clouds will begin to form stars before reaching densities exceeding @xmath46  amu  @xmath2 and stellar and supernova feedback will rapidly overwhelm any internal diffuse radiation field .",
    "therefore , we expect this to be a minor issue .",
    "* charge - exchange reactions can efficiently transfer electrons between ions with similar ionization potentials .",
    "given their high abundances , hi and hii are the ions most likely reaction partners .",
    "some of the ions that play an important role in gas cooling below @xmath10  k via fine - structure line emission , such as oi , are particularly affected by these reactions .",
    "we adopt the charge - transfer reaction rates for ci , cii , oi - v , sii - v , and fei - v from @xcite and from the online ornl / uga charge transfer database for astrophysics ( http://www-cfadc.phy.ornl.gov/astro/ps/data/ ) .",
    "* charge - exchange reactions are but one example of reactions that involve ions of different elements .",
    "other examples are molecule and dust particle formation .",
    "we opted not to include molecular processes in the present work for the following reasons .",
    "judging from e.g. @xcite and @xcite , cooling below @xmath47  k by molecules is dominated by cooling by metals once the latter are present at levels @xmath48 . however , at the low metallicities where h@xmath49 cooling might be important , the low dust content strongly inhibits the formation of h@xmath49 and the timescale for the conversion of hi to h@xmath49 becomes much larger than the local free - fall time @xcite .",
    "hence , in this metallicity range , star formation will precede the formation of h@xmath49 .",
    "also , the rates at which dust forms and at which h@xmath49 molecules form via grain catalysis contain many extra free parameters ( such as the timescales for dust formation , growth , and destruction , the dust grain size , the probability for an h atom to stick to a grain , the probability that two h atoms on a grain join and detach themselves from the grain as a single h@xmath49 molecule , etc . )",
    "that need to be constrained by experiments and observations @xcite .",
    "still , by neglecting molecular cooling we might be under - estimating the cooling rate at temperatures below @xmath47  k for metallicities below @xmath50 .",
    "however , by not using the `` independent element '' approximation , as in @xcite and @xcite , to calculate the ionization balance and the cooling curves , our approach can straightforwardly be extended in future work . * using all these ingredients , we calculate cooling and heating curves for the temperature range @xmath51  k. this way , the cooling and heating rates are calculated in perfect consistence with the ionization equilibrium over a very wide range of temperatures . thus , there is no need to stitch together cooling curves from different authors with potentially very different ( and inconsistent ) input physics .",
    "for this work , we have extended the capabilities of chiantipy , a python interface to the chianti atomic database @xcite , available from http://chiantipy.sourceforge.net/. for all ions , we use the recombination rates , collisional ionization rates , and energy level populations provided by standard chiantipy .",
    "photo - ionization cross - sections @xmath52 are adopted from @xcite and integrated over the stellar and cosmic uv backgrounds in order to obtain the photo - ionization rate @xmath53 and the photo - heating rate @xmath54 with @xmath55 the ion s ionization threshold .",
    "the integral over the radiation backgrounds is split in two parts :  the part for photon energies above 1  ry , which can be suppressed by hi self - shielding , and the part for photon energies below 1  ry , which is assumed to be unaffected by self - shielding . for instance , the photo - ionization rate of an element can then be written as @xmath56     ( colored curves ) , and cooling timescale , @xmath57 ( red curve ) , as a function of temperature for different redshifts and densities ( as indicated in the panels ) .",

    "since non - equilibrium cooling generally leads to over - ionization compared with cie , it also tends to suppress the h cooling peak .",

    "infrared fine - structure emission lines from @xmath6-element ions such as oi and siii contribute to the cooling rate @xcite and can make an order of magnitude difference depending on whether a gas parcel has been enriched only the by snia and low - mass stars ( the `` slow '' contribution to the yield ) or only by snii and massive stars ( the `` fast '' contribution to the yield ) . since the `` fast '' and `` slow '' yields of carbon happen to be very similar , the cooling rate is relatively unsensitive to [ mg / fe ] below @xmath46  k. for a very weak or absent uvb , ions of @xmath6-elements with small first ionization potentials , ionized by the isrf , contribute free electrons and slightly raise the cooling rate below @xmath69  k ( this is most noticeable in the bottom panel of fig . [",
    "fig : cooling_dens_z2_feh0.eps ] ) .",
    "the heating rate is a very strong function of gas density and metallicity .",
    "both parameters determine the density of partially ionized atoms capable of absorbing energy from the uvb through further ionization while the former , moreover , sets the amount of self - shielding . at low densities ,",
    "the heating rate is essentially a monotonically declining function of temperature :  the higher the temperature the lower the densities of the lowly - ionized species that absorb heat most efficiently .",
    "the heating rate also increases with increasing metallicity since this obviously raises the number of heat absorbing ions .    at high densities ,",
    "the heating rate shows a much more complex behavior .",
    "while the densities of near - neutral species increase towards lower temperatures , potentially raising the heat - absorbing capabilities of the gas , the self - shielding by neutral hydrogen suppresses the uvb .",
    "this can lead to a plateau in the heating rate for temperatures below @xmath10  k , see e.g. at @xmath113  @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : heating ] .",
    "this plateau is simply the heating rate of a fully neutral hydrogen gas irradiated by a strongly reduced uvb . for higher metallicities ,",
    "lowly ionized metals provide a small amount of extra heating above this plateau .        at the highest densities ,",
    "the hydrogen - ionizing part of the uvb is almost completely suppressed and other sources of heating , such as the isrf , become significant . since hydrogen can not extract heat from the isrf employed in our calculations , the heating rate drops to zero for [ fe / h]@xmath104 when hydrogen recombines . for non - zero metallicities , the isrf can ionize and thus heat those elements that have ionization potentials smaller than that of hydrogen , explaining the complex behavior of the heating rate between @xmath114 and @xmath10  k.    the [ mg / fe]-dependence of the heating rates is much weaker than their metallicity dependence . as an example , we show the heating rate as a function of temperature for fe - abundance [ fe / h]@xmath80 , redshift @xmath76 , gas density @xmath77  @xmath2 , and different [ mg / fe ] ratios in fig . [",
    "fig : heatingmgfe ] . while [ mg / fe ] varies with one dex , the heating rate changes by a factor of 5 at most .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : shielding ] , we plot the net cooling rates , defined as @xmath115 , of solar metallicity gas exposed to the @xmath76 ( top panel ) , @xmath81 ( middle panel ) , and @xmath107 ( bottom panel ) uvb for different densities , with self - shielding ( full lines ) and without self - shielding ( dotted lines ) .",
    "clearly , for densities below the self - shielding threshold density of @xmath3  @xmath2 switching shielding on or off makes no difference :  the uvb can fully penetrate , ionize , and heat the gas . above the self - shielding threshold ( roughly the top four curves in each panel ) ,",
    "the gas is dense enough to recombine and , with self - shielding switched on , to strongly suppress the uvb . as a consequence ,",
    "the heating rate drops steeply below @xmath69  k. with self - shielding switched off , hydrogen also largely recombines but now does not suppress the uvb .",
    "this has a profound influence on the heating rate which keeps on increasing towards lower temperatures until reaching a plateau below @xmath69  k , as discussed earlier . without self - shielding against the uv radiation ,",
    "ionization levels tend to be higher , leading to higher abundances of important cooling ions such as cii and , consequently , to higher cooling rates in the @xmath116  k temperature regime .",
    "self - shielding also has a strong effect on the equilibrium temperature of the gas .",
    "if , without self - shielding , the uvb can flood the gas unimpeded , the equilibrium temperature can be over two orders of magnitude higher than in the self - shielded case ( e.g. @xmath117  k without self - shielding versus @xmath118  k with self - shielding for the @xmath81 uvb at gas density @xmath119  @xmath2 .",
    "the most striking effect of the self - shielding prescription is the equilibrium temperature to which the gas would evolve , given sufficient time .",
    "the sudden downward break in each curve @xmath120 indicates where @xmath121 and hence marks the equilibrium temperature . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : shielding ] , the strong @xmath81 uvb is employed while in the top and bottom panels , the results for the much weaker @xmath76 and @xmath107 uvbs are shown . without self - shielding , gas is incapable of radiatively cooling significantly below @xmath69  k , except for sufficiently high densities and at large enough redshifts where the uvb is still weak . except at late and at very early cosmic times",
    ", the uvb severely inhibits the formation of the cold , high - density clouds in which stars are thought to form while it facilitates the removal of low - density gas by ram - pressure stripping and galaxy interactions @xcite . together with supernova feedback , which most strongly affects high - density regions , this almost completely extinguishes star formation in simulated dwarf galaxies after @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "however , while the specific star - formation rate of local volume dwarf galaxies was generally larger before @xmath123 compared with later times , they do show a wide variety of more or less continuous star - formation histories over their full lifetimes @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether a proper , self - consistent treatment of the effects of photo - heating by the uvb , including the effects of self - shielding , on the ionization equilibrium and the resultant cooling and heating rates , can alleviate this problem .",
    "@xmath80 , redshift @xmath76 , gas density @xmath124  @xmath2 , and different [ mg / fe ] ratios ( color code ) .",
    "[ fig : heatingmgfe],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    moreover , the non - inclusion of self - shielding makes it virtually impossible to clearly identify different phases in the ism of a simulated galaxy and to compare them with observed galaxies .",
    "for instance , in their analysis of a fully cosmological hydrodynamical dwarf galaxy which was simulated including an uvb but neglecting self - shielding , @xcite find that gas particles typically have temperatures of the order of @xmath125  k. in order to investigate the simulated dwarf s hi properties , these authors are forced to select as `` cold '' gas particles those with temperatures below @xmath126  k. since the calculation of the cooling and heating curves presented here involves the determination of the ionization equilibrium as a function of the gas properties , we immediately have the neutral hydrogen fraction at our disposal . as can be seen fig .",
    "[ fig : neutral ] , in the presence of a uvb , the neutral fraction of a gas parcel is not only temperature dependent but also strongly density and redshift dependent . the black dots in this figure indicate the neutral fraction at the equilibrium temperature for each redshift and gas density . clearly , the hydrogen gas has to be denser than several @xmath127  @xmath2 before it can become neutral ( i.e. @xmath128 ) .",
    "this broadly agrees with the estimated lower bound on the density of the warm neutral medium in the milky way @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a new calculation of composition dependent cooling and heating curves intended for use in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution . for each elemental mix , density , temperature , and cosmological time",
    "the ionization equilibrium was determined using a modified version of chiantipy , equipped with collisional and radiative ionization , by the cosmic uv background and an interstellar radiation field , and charge - transfer reactions .",
    "we believe these curves address several drawbacks of currently available tabulations of cooling rates .",
    "we have shown that the full range of abundance variations likely to be encountered in stars and neutral and ionized gas in a galaxy can be described adequately by a simplified chemical - evolution model in which there are only two contributions to the elemental yields :  a `` fast '' one ( encompassing the contributions from snii and massive ims ) and a `` slow '' one ( encompassing the contributions from snia and less massive ims ) .",
    "the ratio of both contributions can be linked directly to the fe and mg abundances which provide us with two strong handles on _ all _ other element abundances .",
    "thus , the cooling and heating curves depend on only five parameters ( temperature , density , redshift , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] ) . they are easily tabulated , and can be efficiently interpolated during a simulation .",
    "we have implemented a five - dimensional interpolator in our own simulation code enabling us to employ the cooling and heating curves presented here in galaxy evolution simulations . a detailed analysis of the effects of using these new curves on such simulations , especially regarding the evolution of the star - formation rate in dwarf galaxies ,",
    "will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",

    "the black dots indicate the neutral fraction at the equilibrium temperature for each density and redshift .",
    "[ fig : neutral],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we believe that the main advantage of this work is that , within the confines of a well - defined chemical evolution model and adopting the ionization equilibrium approximation , it provides accurate cooling and heating curves for a wide range of physical and chemical gas properties",
    ". these should be valid as long as the gas is neutral or , partially , ionized ( molecule and dust formation have not been taken into account ) .",
    "moreover , during a numerical simulation , one need only follow the evolution of the fe and mg abundances , leading to a reduction in memory requirements and computational cost compared to the element - by - element approach .",
    "it takes into account self - shielding in an approximate but motivated and well - tested way .",
    "this is key to resolving the formation of cold , neutral , high - density clouds suitable for star formation and to studying the structure of the multi - phase ism in galaxy simulations .",
    "moreover , since we have stored the ionization equilibrium for each combination of temperature , density , redshift , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] , we can in principle calculate any desired physical property of the gas using chiantipy .",
