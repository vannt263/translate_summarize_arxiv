    "one of the major unsolved problems in modern physics is the dark matter and the dark energy .",

    "all of our scientific studies are related with this ordinary visible matter , which is a very small fraction of the universe .",
    "the dark components of the universe are still not well understood .",
    "there are many theoretical models dealing with dark energy , but here our main concern is the dark matter .",
    "there currently exist many dark matter candidates @xcite .",
    "one interesting possibility is the weyl meson which arises naturally in local scale invariant theories .",
    "this symmetry was introduced by h. weyl in 1929 @xcite , and the gauge particle associated with this symmetry is called the weyl meson .",
    "local scale invariance has been reviewed by many authors @xcite and the mechanism for breaking this symmetry has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the weyl meson acts as a dark matter candidate in a locally scale invariant generalization of the standard model .",
    "cosmological implications of weyl meson in this theory , which contains only one higgs doublet , have been studied in @xcite .",
    "but in this model higgs particle get eliminated from the particle spectrum , which leads to violation of perturbative unitarity beyond electroweak scale , as shown in refs .",

    "a generalization of this model has been proposed by including an additional real scalar field @xmath2 . in this",
    "generalized locally scale invariant standard model , the higgs like particle remains in the physical spectrum and also couples directly with the weyl meson .",
    "this model respects the unitarity condition and hence is perturbatively stable .",
    "the phenomenological implications of this model are also very interesting and need to be studied in detail , which is the main motive of this work .    in this paper we started with the model described in ref.@xcite , which contains the coupling between the weyl meson and the higgs boson .",
    "the weyl meson , which interacts only with the higgs particle and no other sm particle , may serve as a good candidate for the dark matter . to strengthen this possibility we have to look for the processes , involving the weyl meson , at the colliders and also in the universe .",
    "the coupling strength , which plays a crucial role in all these processes , is determined by the free parameters of the theory , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we write the parameter @xmath3 in the term of weyl meson s mass @xmath5 as , @xmath6 . now",

    "our main goal in this paper is to put some constraint on the value of coupling parameters @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 so that the weyl meson can act as a suitable dark matter candidate .",

    "ii we start with generalized local scale invariant standard model and write down the interaction lagrangian for weyl meson .",

    "it is clear from fig.[diffcs ] that the differential cross - section varying smoothly with @xmath62 even in the vicinity of @xmath63 .",
    "this is because the production cross - section for real weyl meson is negligible in this theory .",
    "we find in fig.[3higgs ] that the total cross - section for three higgs production varies from @xmath64 at @xmath65 to @xmath66 at @xmath67 .",
    "hence the cross - section falls    sharply with increase in the mass of the weyl meson . for comparison ,",
    "the production cross - section for single higgs boson with @xmath68 , is roughly @xmath69 .",
    "hence for small values of the weyl meson mass , the three higgs production cross - section is not negligible compared to single higgs cross - section .",
    "the background to the three higgs cross - section would arise from the top quark loop .",
    "this will include two additional vertices of top quark with the higgs boson .",

    "we , therefore , conclude that for small @xmath71 , it may be possible to extract the contribution due to weyl meson to three higgs production cross - section at lhc .",
    "the weyl meson acts as a dark matter candidate since it interacts only with higgs boson and no other sm particles . in sec .",
    "ii we wrote down the various interaction terms for weyl meson . at very early time in the universe , when temperature was very high , weyl meson may remain in thermal equillibrium with other particles by these interactions .",
    "its number density keeps on changing by the coannihilation process .",
    "but as the temperature of the universe drops down to certain level , due to expansion , its interaction rate become less than the expansion rate and coannihilation process ceases .",
    "it gets decoupled from other particles and its number density freezes out at this temperature and remains as relic density . in this section",
    "we calculate the coannihilation rate of the weyl meson and find the possible values of parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 by constraining its abundance equal to the observed dark matter abundance .",
    "we consider only the dominant processes which will contribute to the total coannihilation rate of the weyl meson , as shown in fig.[annihilation ] .",
    "+ interaction rate for annihilation process can be written as    @xmath72 ,    where @xmath73 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section given by , @xcite @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the modified bessel function of second kind of order one , @xmath76 is the temperature at which proces is occuring , @xmath77 is the number degrees of freedom of the weyl meson and @xmath78 is the four momentum in center of mass frame of incoming particles , which is given by @xmath79    let @xmath80 be the polarisation vector of incoming weyl meson , then the scattering amplitude for annihilation of two weyl meson into fermion pair can be written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is defined as ,    @xmath83 .",
    "the top quarks , being massive , will have the dominant contribution in this case .",
    "now we can write the cross section for this process in cm frame of incoming particles , @xmath84 hence the resulting coannihilation rate for this process become @xmath85 for numerical integration , we change the variable @xmath86 to @xmath87 as , @xmath88 and write the expression for @xmath89 in term of modified bessel function of second kind of order two ( @xmath90 ) ( see @xcite ) @xmath91 we can simplify the expression for coannihilation rate in the limit @xmath92 , as we are considering these process very early in the universe , when temperature was very high . considering only those terms which are linear in @xmath41 results in coannihilation rate @xmath93",
    "similarly we can write the coannihilation rate for second process , where weyl meson annihilate into the higgs pair , as @xmath94    next process is the annihilation of weyl meson with higgs particle , for which we have @xmath95 and @xmath96 channel processes .",
    "matrix element of these processes will be sum of all these channels , i.e @xmath97 + where @xmath98",
    "similarly for other channels @xmath99 we used the subscript on @xmath100 to define it in different channels .",
    "the amplitude of this process contains square term of each channel s matrix element and also the cross terms , which we can write by using @xmath101 and @xmath102 we obtain similar expressions for other channels by replacing @xmath86 with @xmath103 and @xmath96 , accordingly .",
    "the cross section for this process can be written as , @xmath104    following the same procedure as before , we define the new variables @xmath105 and @xmath106 such that @xmath107 and write the interaction rate @xmath108 in term of these variables . here again we simplify the expression in the limit @xmath92 , and consider only linear terms in @xmath109 .",
    "so @xmath108 will be of this form @xmath110 where we have absorbed all other quantities in the function @xmath111 .",
    "total annihilation rate @xmath112 of weyl meson is the sum of all three interaction rates , i.e @xmath113      as the universe expands , temperature drops down and probability of annihilation of weyl meson gets decreased .",
    "at some temperature annihilation rate become equal to the expansion rate of universe , known as freeze out temperature @xmath114 .",
    "below this temperature there is no annihilation process , weyl meson decouples from the surrounding and moves freely in the universe . at freeze out temperature , the number density of weyl",
    "meson @xmath115 will get frozen and decrease only because of expansion of the universe .    at freeze out temperature @xmath116 , + i.e @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross - section at freeze out temperature @xmath114 and @xmath119 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom of the all species present at that time . we can write it in invariant form as @xcite @xmath120 where we have used the formula for entropy density @xmath121 of universe given by , @xmath122 as this quantity remain constant , we obtain , @xmath123 hence we can write the abundance of weyl meson in present universe , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the present value of entropy density , @xmath126 is the critical density of the universe and value of @xmath127 for processes at very high temperature .    using @xmath128 from eq . and",
    "@xmath129 , we solve eq .",
    "numerically for different value of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we consider the values of @xmath130 to be equal to present dark matter density(@xmath131 ) . in all calculations",
    "we take the mass of higgs boson @xmath132 , as claimed by cms and atlas groups .",
    "the values of the parameter @xmath4 and @xmath5 for decoupling temperature @xmath133 to @xmath134 are shown in fig.[bms ] .",
    "we find , as expected , the lower @xmath4 leads to higher decoupling temperature .",
    "hence for small value of coupling parameter weyl meson get decoupled very early in the universe .",
    "furthermore @xmath4 also increase with @xmath5 .",
    "in the previous section we have constrained the values of coupling parameters from the coannihilation rate and abundance of weyl meson . but weyl meson may also have the probability to decay into higgs particles .",
    "so it may be possible that after the decoupling all the weyl meson particles have already been decayed and today they may not be present in the universe . in this section",
    "we calculate the decay rate of the weyl meson and constraint its life time to be equal to the age of universe .",
    "we show that the certain range of parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 satisfiies these conditions .",
    "we consider the simplest process for the decay of weyl meson into pairs of higgs particles and fermions , as shown in fig.[wdecy ]    the amplitude for this process is given by @xmath135 where @xmath136 contains all the constant .",
    "now we define four momenta square @xmath137 , such that @xmath138 in term of these variables , we find @xmath139 and hence the amplitude of this process becomes function of the variables @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "+ the decay rate for this process is @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the four dimensional phase space integral and again can be decomposed into product of two dimensional phase space integral@xcite @xmath144 here @xmath145 is the two dimensional phase space integral in rest frame of particles having momentum @xmath146 and @xmath147",
    ".    if weyl meson is a suitable dark matter candidate then it must be present in today s universe .",
    "so its life time(@xmath148 ) must be at least equal to or greater than the age of the universe .",
    "we determine @xmath112 numerically from eq.([drate ] ) and find those values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for which the life time of weyl meson is equal to the age of the universe @xmath149 .",
    "we have considered only the simplest process of the weyl meson s decay , as we are interested only in its decay rate to constrain the value of parameter @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 .",
    "final decay products can also be photons or electron - positron pairs .",
    "there are many observations showing the excess of positrons in cosmic rays @xcite",
    ". this excess of positrons may also be due to the decay products of the weyl meson .",
    "we postpone the detailed analysis and fitting of the data for future research .",
    "now we have the posible range of parameter @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 from its relic density condition and its decay rate constraint .",
    "if weyl meson is the dark matter candidate then it must satisfy both of these conditions .",
    "combining these two results we have obtained the possible values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the weyl meson , as shown in fig.[relic ] .",
    "here decoupling temperature @xmath114 is still an unknown parameter , but the intersting result which we have obtained is that the mass of the weyl meson can not be greater than @xmath150 and the parameter @xmath4 has minimum value @xmath151 .",
    "these are the values which the weyl meson can have if it is a very weakly interacting particle , such that it decouple immediately after the reheating of the universe(@xmath152 ) .",
    "if @xmath4 is smaller than @xmath153 then the weyl meson decouples before the reheating of universe and no constraint can be imposed on its relic density .",
    "we also find that the low mass range of the weyl meson , which may be observable in colliders , is allowed by cosmological constraints .",
    "generalized locally scale invariant standard model leads to the direct coupling between the weyl meson and the higgs boson@xcite .",
    "weyl meson has been introduced in 1929 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have discussed the implications of the weyl meson in collider physics and in cosmology in detail .",
    "we find that in the colliders real weyl meson can not be produced for such type of interaction , but it can be produced virtually and leads to the production of three higgs particles .",
    "we have discussed the three higgs production process at lhc which can give us the signature of the weyl meson for some finite value of coupling parameter .",
