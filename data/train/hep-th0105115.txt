    "the fate of the unstable d - branes due to the tachyon condensation has been one of centers of interest in string theory since the seminal papers by sen @xcite , where he conjectured that the unstable d - branes may behave like solitons corresponding to lower dimensional d - branes . since the tachyon condensation @xcite is an off - shell phenomenon , we need to resort to the second quantized string theory in order to understand this noble phenomenon .",
    "there are two approaches available to this subject ; the witten s open string field theory @xcite with the level truncation @xcite and the boundary string field theory ( bsft ) @xcite .",
    "as the tachyon condensation occurs the open string field acquires an expectation value .",
    "in general it is quite difficult to solve the string field equation which involves an infinite number of components .",
    "one may solve the string field equation by truncating the string field to the first few string levels .",
    "this has been a useful practical tool to discuss the tachyon condensation .",
    "many aspects of the tachyon condensation physics @xcite were explored by this method .",
    "however , this method provides numerical results in most cases and sometimes yields qualitative ones only .",
    "the second approach , which is based on the background independent string field theory @xcite , has been developed recently @xcite as an alternative tool to the string field theory with level truncation .",
    "it deals with the disk partition function of the open string theory , where the boundary of the disk is defined by the trace of the two ends of the open string .",
    "the configuration space for the bsft is the space of two dimensional world - sheet theories on the disk with arbitrary boundary interactions .",
    "endowing it with the antibracket structure in terms of the world - sheet path integral on the disk and the brst operator , one can define @xmath1 , the action of the target space theory .",
    "the relationship between the bsft action , @xmath1 and the disk partition function @xmath2 is clarified in ref.@xcite as s = ( 1 + ^i ) z where @xmath3 are the couplings of the boundary interactions and @xmath4 are the corresponding world - sheet @xmath5-functions . choosing the tachyon profile , @xmath6 , as for the boundary interaction , one can obtain the effective action for tachyon field @xcite .",
    "evaluation of the effective action may be simplified considerably if we introduce a large @xmath7 b - field @xcite .",
    "recent works also show that @xmath1 may coincide with @xmath2 if we introduce supersymmetry to describe the @xmath8-@xmath9 system @xcite .",
    "the disk partition function @xmath2 for the @xmath8-@xmath9 system has been explicitly evaluated in recent papers @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the tachyon condensation in the simplest setting , i.e. , a single unstable d - brane in the bosonic string theory , adopting the boundary state formulation , which developed by callan , lovelace , nappi and yost @xcite sometime ago",
    ". the advantage of this approach is that one can explicitly construct the quantum states corresponding to the unstable d - brane systems .",
    "hence , the couplings of the system to the various string states are readily obtained so it helps us to understand how the system evolves as the condensation occurs .",
    "this approach is closely related to the second one , the bsft in that the normalization factor of the boundary state is simply the disk partition function @xmath2 .",
    "since the constructed boundary state is given as a quantum state of the closed string field , it may also help us to understand its relationship to the first approach based on the open string field theory , if we appropriately utilize the open - closed string duality .",
    "we extend the boundary state formulation to the case of the noncommutative open string theory in order to discuss the noncommutative tachyon in the same framework .",
    "the relationship of the commutative theory and the noncommutative theory on the tachyon condensation can be understood in this framework along the line of the equivalence between the commutative theory and the noncommutative theory of open string @xcite .",
    "we begin with the boundary state construction developed in ref.@xcite and establish the relationship between the boundary action and the boundary state in more general cases .",
    "the boundary state formulation is based on a rather simple observation : it utilizes the open - closed string duality . the disk diagram in the open string theory",
    "can be viewed equivalently as the disk diagram in the closed string theory .",
    "epsf.tex = 0.7    figure 1 : a. disk diagram in open string theory , b. disk diagram in closed string theory    in the open string theory it depicts an open string appearing from the vacuum , then subsequently disappearing into the vacuum while in the closed string theory it depicts a closed string propagating from the boundary of the disk , then disappearing .",
    "this open - closed string duality is also useful when we deal with the cylindrical diagram .",
    "the cylindrical diagram make an appearance both in the open string theory and in the closed string theory .",
    "however , it can be interpreted differently in two theories . in the open string theory",
    "it describes a one - loop amplitude while in the closed string it describes a tree level amplitude .",
    "since the closed string description often turns out to be simpler than its open string counterpart , the boundary state formulation has been employed as a practical method to evaluate the open string diagrams by making use of this open - closed string duality .",
    "it is proved to be extremely useful especially when we discuss various interactions between the @xmath8-brane and the open string .",
    "we define the boundary state @xmath10 by the following eigenvalue equation in the closed string theory ^x = x^x .",
    "since @xmath11 and @xmath12 are defined on @xmath13 , the boundary of the disk , we may expand them as @xcite    [ exp : all ] ^ ( ) & = & ^_0 + _ n=1 \\ { ( a^_n + ^_n ) e^2 in + ( a^_n + ^_n ) e^-2 in } [ exp : a ] + x^ ( ) & = & x^_0 + _ n=1 ( x^_n e^2 in + ^_n e^-2 in ) [ exp : b ]    where @xmath14 $ ] , @xmath15 , and a^_n = ^_n , a^_n = - ^_-n , ^_n = ^_n , ^_n = - ^_-n .",

    "taking notice that the left and the right movers along the directions of the tachyon condensation respect the open string metric @xmath92 , which is singular in the large b - field limit , we find a resolution in the framework of the boundary state formulation . using the t - dual relationship between the left and right movers in the commutative theory and those in the noncommutative theory",
