    "because the fact that several dynamical systems exhibit a chaotic behavior , there has been much interest in the study of chaos . in recent years ,",
    "the trend of analysing the chaos moved to the new phase consisting of its control and utilization : this means on one hand to design suitable controls to eliminate the chaos , and on the other hand to generate it intentionally .",
    "our goal in this work is to carry out a rigorous mathematical analysis of dynamic behavior of the whole family of the generalized lorenz system in its chaotic regime by using time delayed feedback controlling forces in the same spirit of @xcite .",
    "the controller is a nonlinear function of the state variables of the system , therefore the results obtained in this paper can be considered in some way an improvement of the results of @xcite , where the authors study the generalized lorenz system with a linear version of the control proposed here .",

    "in particular , we obtain the lorenz system for @xmath1 and the chen system for @xmath2 . indeed , the systems belonging to the family of the generalized lorenz system have a similar mathematical structure but they are not topologically equivalent . + in the first part of the paper we introduce the controlled system and we consider the effects of the delay on the steady states also investigating the occurrence of stability switches",

    "pointed out in @xcite , based on the center manifold reduction and the normal form theory , in order to determine the direction , stability and period of these periodic solutions which bifurcate from the steady state .",
    "this strategy permits to derive the explicit formulas for the properties of the hopf bifurcation .",
    "moreover , we give numerical simulations of the controlled system , which indicate that when the delay passes through certain critical values , the chaotic behavior is converted to stable periodic orbit for thw whole family of systems .",
    "the generalized lorenz system is described by the following system of ordinary differential equations for the state variables _ x , y , z _ : @xmath4 where @xmath5 $ ] , and it has been introduced for the first time in @xcite . by varying the parameter @xmath6 , we obtain different but structurally similar systems : precisely , they have the same kind of equilibria stability , but they are not topologically equivalent . in particular , the system reduces to the lorenz system for @xmath1 , to the lu system for @xmath7 and to the chen system for @xmath2 , in their chaotic regime . the system @xmath8 has the following three equilibrium points :    @xmath9 ; @xmath10    and they are all unstable for all @xmath5 $ ] . in the chaotic regime ,",

    "<S> in this work we propose a feedback approach to regulate the chaotic behavior of the whole family of the generalized lorenz system , by designing a nonlinear delayed feedback control . </S>",
    "<S> we first study the effect of the delay on the dynamics of the system and we investigate the existence of hopf bifurcations . </S>",
    "<S> then , by using the center manifold reduction technique and the normal form theory , we derive the explicit formulas for the direction , stability and period of the periodic solutions bifurcating from the steady state at certain critical values of the delay . </S>"
