    "giant planets are found orbiting nearby stars with semimajor axes as small as 0.04  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulty of forming planets so close to a star has led to the suggestion that these planets formed at larger radii and migrated inwards , perhaps through gravitational interactions with the gaseous protoplanetary disk or planetesimal disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "when massive planets migrate , they can capture smaller bodies in mean - motion resonances .",
    "resonant capture in the solar system was invoked by goldreich ( 1965 ) to explain the frequent occurrence of commensurable periods among planetary satellites ; in this case the satellites are migrating outwards due to tidal friction ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "similarly , the outward migration of neptune probably led to the capture of pluto and many kuiper - belt objects ( `` plutinos '' ) into the 2:3 resonance with neptune ( malhotra 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "all known examples of resonant capture in the solar system involve outward migration .",
    "however , the compact orbits of exosolar planets are believed to result from inward migration .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore some of the novel features of resonant capture during inward migration .",
    "we shall use the delaunay elements , l=(m_a)^1/2 , g = l(1-e^2)^1/2 , h = gi , , g= , h= ; [ eq : delaunay ] here @xmath3 is the mass of the star in units where the gravitational constant is unity , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the semimajor axis , eccentricity , and inclination ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mean anomaly , argument of periastron , and longitude of the ascending node ; @xmath10 is the specific angular momentum and @xmath11 is the @xmath12-component of the angular momentum . in these variables",
    "the kepler hamiltonian is h_k(l)=-m_^22l^2 , [ eq : kepham ] and the mean motion @xmath13 .    for simplicity we shall consider only the case of a test particle that is captured by a massive body on a circular orbit with zero inclination .",
    "we shall call this body `` jupiter '' ; its mass , semimajor axis , and mean motion are denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "a @xmath17 mean - motion resonance occurs when @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are integers .",
    "we distinguish inner resonances , which lie inside jupiter ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , from outer resonances ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the test particle can be written in the form h_k(l)+_p , q , ma_pqm(l , g , h ) ; [ eq : hamres ] here @xmath27 is the azimuth of jupiter , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are integers . the angles @xmath31 and @xmath32 can only appear in the combination @xmath33 because the hamiltonian is invariant to changes in the origin of the azimuth .",
    "the restriction that the coefficient of @xmath34 must be an even integer @xmath35 arises because the planetary potential is symmetric about the equatorial plane , so that the hamiltonian must be invariant under the transformation @xmath36 , @xmath37 . for low - eccentricity , low - inclination orbits , @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "the terms with @xmath40 can also contain a contribution from an additional axisymmetric potential , due for example to a protoplanetary disk or the equatorial bulge of the central star .",
    "terms with @xmath41 are sometimes called the secular hamiltonian since they do not depend on either the mean anomaly @xmath7 or the azimuth of jupiter @xmath32 and thus are time - independent for keplerian motion .",
    "each @xmath17 mean - motion resonance is represented in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamres ] ) by an infinite series in @xmath30 .",
    "we can isolate the slowly varying resonant angle by a canonical transformation to new momenta and coordinates @xmath42 defined by the mixed - variable generating function s(,,g , h)=r_1 + r_2 g + r_3[p+ ( p+q)(g+h-_j ) ] .",
    "[ eq : sssone ] we have l = s = r_1+pr_3,g = sg = r_2 + ( p+q)r_3,h = sh=(p+q)r_3 , [ eq : rdef ] r_1=sr_1= , r_2=sr_2=g , r_3=sr_3=p+ ( p+q)(g+h-_j ) . [",
    "eq : ssstwo ] near the resonance , @xmath43 varies much more rapidly than @xmath44 or @xmath45 , so we can average the hamiltonian over the fast variable @xmath43 at fixed @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the conjugate action @xmath46 is a constant of motion in the averaged hamiltonian and an adiabatic invariant of the original hamiltonian",
    ". therefore c_pq(p+q)r_1=(p+q)l - ph=(m_a)^1/2[(p+q)-p(1-e^2)^1/2i ] [ eq : adinv ] is adiabatically invariant .",
    "the averaged hamiltonian has two degrees of freedom .",
    "the nature of the trajectories in the averaged hamiltonian depends on the relative strength of the secular and resonant hamiltonians .",
    "if the secular hamiltonian is either large or small compared to the resonant hamiltonian , the timescales for libration or circulation of the associated coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath45 are well - separated , and the problem can be reduced to one degree of freedom by a second averaging . in the intermediate case ,",
    "resonances with different @xmath30 can overlap , leading to chaotic motion .",
    "all three regimes are present in various solar - system contexts .    despite these complexities ,",
    "some of the principal features of resonant capture can be deduced directly from the adiabatic invariant @xmath47 ( eq . [ eq : adinv ] ) .",
    "suppose that the test particle is initially on a circular , equatorial orbit at semimajor axis @xmath48",
    ". then @xmath49 .",
    "once the particle is captured into resonance , its semimajor axis will migrate along with jupiter s to preserve the mean - motion resonance , thereby pumping up the test particle s eccentricity and/or inclination .",
    "the adiabatic invariance of @xmath47 then requires that ( 1-e^2)^1/2i=1+qp .",
    "[ eq : kappadef ] the quantity on the left is initially unity ( since @xmath50 ) and can only decrease . for an outer resonance ( @xmath26 )",
    "this requires that @xmath51 ; in other words capture into an outer resonance can only occur if the perturber migrates outward .",
    "if the perturber migrates a long way outwards , then @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "note that @xmath54 since @xmath19 , @xmath55 ; thus captured orbits never achieve radial ( @xmath56 ) or polar ( @xmath57 ) orbits .",
    "similarly , capture into an inner resonance ( @xmath23 ) can only occur if the perturber migrates inward . however , in this case the eccentricity and inclination evolution is more dramatic .",
    "the quantity @xmath58 when @xmath59 ; in other words , by the time jupiter has migrated inward by a factor of @xmath60 after capture , the test particle has been driven onto either a radial or a polar orbit . if migration continues past this point and the test particle remains in resonance , it must be driven onto a retrograde orbit ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the minimum possible value of @xmath62 is @xmath63 ( for @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is attained when jupiter has migrated inward by a factor of @xmath66 since capture ; if migration continues past this point the test particle can not remain in resonance .",
    "these simple considerations suggest that inward migration of a planet can excite small planets or planetesimals into high - eccentricity , high - inclination , or retrograde orbits . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we shall investigate the evolution and fate of these objects numerically .",
    "in our integrations we use units in which the gravitational constant , jupiter s initial semimajor axis @xmath67 and orbital period are all unity , so @xmath68 .",
    "jupiter s mass is @xmath69 .",
    "jupiter is assumed to follow a circular orbit that migrates inward according to the rule a_j(t)=a_jf+(1-a_jf)(-t/ ) , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the test - particle integrations were carried out in regularized coordinates .",
    "figure [ fig : one ] shows the evolution of a test particle initially on a zero - inclination , circular orbit with semimajor axis @xmath72 .",
    "the test particle is captured into the 2:1 resonance ( @xmath73 ) with jupiter at @xmath74 .",
    "thereafter its orbit shrinks and its eccentricity grows , as predicted by the adiabatic invariant @xmath62 ( eq . [ eq : kappadef ] ) . eventually at @xmath75 , when the semimajor axis has shrunk by a factor of @xmath76 since capture , the orbit is nearly radial ( @xmath77 ) . in typical planetary systems , a small body in this high - eccentricity phase",
    "would be vaporized by or collide with the star , but we shall continue to follow the dynamical evolution assuming that the particle survives . at this point",
    "the inclination flips rapidly from @xmath78 to @xmath79 ( recall that inclination is undefined for radial orbits ) .",
    "once the inclination is @xmath79 the eccentricity shrinks as the orbit continues to shrink , again as predicted by adiabatic invariance .",
    "finally , at @xmath80 , when the semimajor axis is a factor of @xmath81 smaller than at capture , the test particle is released from the resonance on a retrograde , equatorial , near - circular orbit .",
    "figure [ fig : two ] shows the final states of an ensemble of test particles , on initially circular , zero - inclination orbits with initial semimajor axes @xmath48 between 0.26 and 0.6 .",
    "the planet migrates from @xmath82 to @xmath70 , so the 2:1 resonance migrates from @xmath83 to @xmath84 . according to equation ( [ eq : kappadef ] ) , particles will be captured into resonance during the migration if @xmath85 , flipped onto retrograde orbits if @xmath86 , and released from resonance on nearly circular , retrograde orbits if @xmath87 . for particles with @xmath88 the eccentricity is given by a_i = a_rf^2 , [ eq : predict ] which is plotted as a dotted line .",
    "all of these predictions agree very well with the results shown in the figure .",
    "the evolution is more complicated when the test particles have non - zero eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "figure [ fig : three ] shows the final states of test particles with the same range of initial semimajor axes as in figure [ fig : two ] , but with eccentricities and inclinations chosen from the schwarzschild or rayleigh distribution , n(e , i)dedi(-e^22e_0 ^ 2-i^22i_0 ^ 2)edeidi . [ eq : ray ] at the end of the integration , most of the particles",
    "are found in one of three final states :    * the particles shown as filled circles are in retrograde ( @xmath89 ) orbits trapped in the 2:1 resonance , like those shown in figure [ fig : two ] .",
    "if migration had continued , these would eventually be released from resonance on nearly circular orbits , after their semimajor axis had migrated by a factor 9 since capture ( this has already happened for two particles , marked by open circles ) .",
    "these particles typically have small initial eccentricities and inclinations , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "* the particles marked by crosses are on escape orbits , or chaotic orbits that are likely to escape in the future . in most cases these particles",
    "are pumped onto high - eccentricity orbits , released from resonance , and then suffer a close encounter with jupiter , leading to a random walk in semimajor axis and eventual escape .",
    "the evolution of the orbital elements in a typical case is shown in figure [ fig : four ] .",
    "these particles typically have initial eccentricities @xmath92 .",
    "note that the final eccentricity and inclination for the escaping orbits are given in the center - of - mass frame , while all other orbital elements in this and other figures are given in the star - centered frame . *",
    "the particles marked by open triangles were trapped in the 2:1 resonance and later released on nearly polar orbits ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "these particles have high eccentricities and arguments of perihelion @xmath8 that librate around @xmath94 .",
    "this secular resonance protects high - eccentricity orbits from close encounters with jupiter , so the particle orbits are stable on the timescale of our integrations ( @xmath95 initial orbital periods of jupiter ) .",
    "these orbits typically have initial inclination @xmath96 .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig : five ] .",
    "giant planets are found orbiting close to many nearby stars . because the conditions in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks are unfavorable to planet formation",
    ", it is likely that these planets formed at much larger radii and migrated inward .",
    "moreover , because the characteristic evolution times in a protoplanetary disk are longer at larger radius , it is likely that planetesimals and small planets had already formed interior to this giant planet before it began its inward journey . in these circumstances",
    "resonant capture by the inward migrating planet is likely to occur at the 2:1 mean - motion resonance .",
    "we have shown that small bodies that are captured from circular , equatorial orbits into the 2:1 resonance will be excited onto nearly radial orbits by the time their semimajor axis has shrunk by a factor of four , and released from the resonance on nearly circular retrograde orbits when the semimajor axis has shrunk by a factor of nine . in most of the known planetary systems ,",
    "these small bodies would be consumed by the central star during this high - eccentricity phase .",
    "thus , substantial migration of a giant planet is likely to pollute the outer parts of the star with most of the mass in the interior planetesimal disk : specifically , if the planet migrates from @xmath67 to @xmath97 , then the planetesimals with initial semimajor axes in the range @xmath98 will be excited to high - eccentricity orbits and are likely to be vaporized by or collide with the central star .",
    "bodies that do not collide with the star will eventually be released from resonance as migration continues . some of these will be ejected , but some are protected from ejection by secular resonance and can survive on polar , high - eccentricity orbits .",
    "others are released from resonance on circular and equatorial but retrograde orbits , and will survive if the migration stops before the giant planet reaches their semimajor axis . thus ,",
    "if the captured planets survive the high - eccentricity phase , their post - migration configuration may not be planar ; if the orbits are coplanar , they may not all orbit in the same direction .",
    "if multiple bodies formed from a single disk ( `` planets '' ) are not necessarily on coplanar orbits , they may be difficult to distinguish from bodies formed from fragmentation of a collapsing gas cloud ( `` stars '' ) .",
    "radial - velocity observations can not directly measure the relative inclinations of planets in multi - planet systems ; this determination requires astrometric measurements such as those planned for the space interferometry mission ( sim ) .",
    "this preliminary study has not addressed many important issues , including the effects of an eccentric planet orbit , the stability of these resonances to gravitational noise from other planets and massive planetesimals , or migration in systems containing two or more giant planets ."
