    "existence of minimal symplectic structures on @xmath1-manifolds is a fundamental question in smooth @xmath1-manifold topology .",
    "there has been much interest especially in producing minimal symplectic @xmath1-manifolds in the homeomorphism classes of standard simply - connected @xmath1-manifolds with small second homology , such as blow - ups of @xmath10 or @xmath11 . over the last two decades",
    ", many ingenious construction techniques , such as rational blowdowns , generalized fiber sum , knot surgery and luttinger surgery , have been introduced to effectively address this problem by fintushel and stern , gompf , jongil park , and several others .",
    "( e.g.  @xcite . ) resting on spectacular results of taubes on seiberg - witten invariants of symplectic @xmath1-manifolds , these constructions have demonstrated that minimal symplectic @xmath1-manifolds not only constitute _ small exotic @xmath1-manifolds _ ( which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to standard ones ) , but also resource them in almost all the known instances .    on the other hand ,",
    "since the pioneering works of donaldson and gompf in late @xmath12s , it is known that symplectic @xmath1-manifolds , up to blow - ups , correspond to lefschetz fibrations , which can be studied combinatorially as _ positive factorizations _ ,",
    "i.e. factorizations of boundary dehn twists into positive dehn twists in the mapping class groups of compact oriented surfaces .",
    "this brings a priori an understanding that _ any _ symplectic @xmath1-manifold , if it exists , should come from a positive factorization . in practice , however , the very idea of constructing small exotic @xmath1-manifolds via new positive factorizations has hardly been utilized up to date .",
    "the main objective of this article is to demonstrate ways to successfully implement this latter approach by constructing positive factorization for lefschetz fibrations with small number of critical points , which we call _ small lefschetz fibrations _ in analogy ( section  [ smalllfs ] ) , as they correspond to @xmath1-manifolds with small second homology . by the virtue of our constructions",
    ", these will provide simple descriptions of many new small exotic @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "lefschetz fibrations of fiber genus @xmath13 and @xmath14 are well - known : their total spaces are diffeomorphic to complex surfaces @xmath10 , @xmath15 , elliptic surfaces @xmath16 , and their blow - ups @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a lefschetz fibration to bear any new symplectic @xmath1-manifold , the fiber genus should be at least @xmath0 . by a thorough analysis of small genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibrations",
    ", we will show that one can already achieve a lot with genus-@xmath0 fibrations .",
    "[ mainthm ] there exist decomposable genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibrations , whose total spaces are minimal symplectic @xmath1-manifolds homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and to @xmath19 for @xmath20",
    ".    we will describe all the genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibrations in theorem  [ mainthm ] explicitly via positive factorizations in the mapping class group of a genus-@xmath0 surface with one boundary component ( section  [ sec : exotic ] ; theorems  [ exoticcp ] and [ exotic3cp ] ) .",
    "these positive factorizations contain at least two proper ( even smaller ! ) positive factorizations , which amounts to them decomposing as nontrivial fiber sums of lefschetz fibrations .",
    "based on @xcite , this allows us to conclude that the corresponding lefschetz fibrations are _ minimal _ in the stronger sense : they are not only relatively minimal , i.e. not containing any exceptional spheres in the fibers , but also they do not contain any exceptional spheres at all ( proposition  [ minimalityprop ] ) .",
    "we construct the exotic genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibrations of theorem  [ mainthm ] in two main steps . in section  [ smalllfs ]",
    ", we will describe a general procedure to produce small positive factorizations in the mapping class group , which we will call _ reverse engineering _",
    ", motivated by a similar procedure defined by fintushel and stern under the same name to produce small exotic @xmath1-manifolds @xcite .",
    "we employ this technique to obtain several ( very ) small positive factorizations , including the smallest possible positive factorization for a nontrivial genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibration ( theorem  [ thesmallest ] ) .",
    "as we will observe ( proposition  [ difftypes ] ) , these very small positive factorizations themselves are not exotic ; they always have total spaces _ diffeomorphic _ to complex rational and ruled surfaces .",
    "then the second step of the construction will be to take products of certain conjugates of these positive factorizations to arrive at _ simply - connected _ exotic lefschetz fibrations of theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "as quick byproducts of our two step construction , we will also show that there are mostly nonholomorphic genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibrations with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with any fundamental group @xmath23 ( remark  [ noncomplex ] ) , and also that there exist an infinite family of pairwise non - diffeomorphic minimal symplectic @xmath1-manifolds in the homeomorphism classes of @xmath19 for @xmath24 ( corollary  [ infinitecor ] ) .",
    "next is a complementary result :    [ scgeography ] any _ simply - connected _ minimal genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibration @xmath25 with @xmath26 is homeomorphic to @xmath27 for some @xmath28 or to @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "this theorem will follow from our study of the _ geography _ of small minimal genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibrations in section  [ geography ] . there",
    "we analyze which pairs @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the number of dehn twists along nonseparating and separating curves in a positive factorization on a genus-@xmath0 surface , can possibly exist .",
    "we will use a combination of obstructions coming from the algebraic topology and the seiberg - witten invariants of genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibrations ( lemmas  [ constraints ] and  [ atmost30 ] ) to determine the list of homeomorphism classes that can possibly support any simply - connected genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibration with @xmath6 ( theorem  [ scgeography ] ) .",
    "the only possible case we have not been able to realize by a minimal simply - connected genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibration so far is when @xmath34 and the total space is homeomorphic to @xmath35 .",
    "this is the exception noted in the theorem , which we are inclined to believe exists .",
    "we would like to remark that minimal , decomposable genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibrations in the homeomorphism class of @xmath36 are already present in the literature : as shown by fintushel and stern , knot surgery on the elliptic surface @xmath37 with a genus-@xmath14 fibered knot yields a genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibration , and this fibration decomposes into two smaller fibrations on complex ruled surfaces @xcite , which has been seen as a very special example up until now . also preceding our results are a few other examples of minimal simply - connected genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibrations for larger @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which have been obtained through lantern substitutions corresponding to rational blowdowns : for again @xmath36 by endo and gurtas @xcite and for @xmath40 with @xmath41 by akhmedov and park @xcite .    in section  [ evensmaller ]",
    ", we will show that luttinger surgeries along fibered lagrangian tori in small genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibrations over surfaces of positive genera can be used to produce minimal symplectic @xmath1-manifolds in even smaller homeomorphism classes ( theorem  [ thm : evensmaller ] ) . per theorem  [ scgeography ] , this can only be achieved by dropping the fibered aspect , and thus these examples always involve a couple of luttinger surgeries that destroy the fibration structure .",
    "we will prove :    [ mainthm3 ] there exist decomposable minimal genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibrations over @xmath42 and @xmath43 which are equivalent via luttinger surgeries to minimal symplectic @xmath1-manifolds homeomorphic to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the only other examples of minimal symplectic @xmath1-manifolds in theorem  [ mainthm3 ] were given by akhmedov and park in @xcite , and later by fintushel and stern for @xmath8 in @xcite .",
    "the vantage point in our constructions is that departing from lefschetz fibrations allows us to carry on fairly simple fundamental group calculations , and the resulting exotic @xmath1-manifolds are easy to describe in terms of handle decompositions ( remark  [ experts ] ) .",
    "let us finish by turning back to the fundamental point underlying our work initiated here .",
    "as discussed above , _ any _ symplectic @xmath1-manifold , let it be fake , exotic , or else , would arise from a positive factorization for a lefschetz fibration or a pencil .",
    "our analysis of genus-@xmath0 lefschetz fibrations show that minimal symplectic @xmath1-manifolds homeomorphic to smaller number of blow - ups of @xmath10 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 will only come from positive factorizations in the mapping class group of higher genera surfaces .",
