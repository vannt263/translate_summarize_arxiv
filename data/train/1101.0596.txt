    "following the pioneering work of @xcite , it is by now well known that , for large @xmath1 , the set @xmath13 approximates an origin - centered euclidean lattice ball @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is such that @xmath17 has volume @xmath1 ) .",
    "the authors recently showed that this is true in a fairly strong sense @xcite : the maximal distance from a point where @xmath18 is non - zero to @xmath19 is a.s .",
    "@xmath2 if @xmath3 and @xmath4 if @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath20 is large enough , the probability that this maximal distance exceeds @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 when @xmath5 ) decays faster than any fixed ( negative ) power of @xmath1 .",
    "some of these results are obtained by different methods in @xcite .",
    "this paper will ask what happens if , instead of considering the maximal distance from @xmath19 at time @xmath1 , we consider the `` average error '' at time @xmath1 ( allowing inner and outer errors to cancel each other out ) .",
    "it turns out that in a distributional `` average fluctuation '' sense , the set @xmath13 deviates from @xmath17 by only a constant number of lattice spaces when @xmath23 and by an even smaller amount when @xmath5 .",
    "appropriately normalized , the fluctuations of @xmath13 , taken over time and space , define a distribution on @xmath24 that converges in law to a variant of the gaussian free field ( gff ) : a random distribution on @xmath24 that we will call the * augmented gaussian free field*. ( it can be constructed by defining the gff in spherical coordinates and replacing variances associated to spherical harmonics of degree @xmath25 by variances associated to spherical harmonics of degree @xmath26 ; see [ ss.augmentedgff ] . )",
    "the `` augmentation '' appears to be related to a damping effect produced by the mean curvature of the sphere ( as discussed below ) .",
    ", with particles started uniformly on @xmath27 .",
    "though we do not prove this here , we expect the cluster boundaries to be approximately flat cross - sections of the cylinder , and we expect the fluctuations to scale to the _ ordinary _ gff on the half cylinder as @xmath28 . ]    to our knowledge , no central limit theorem of this kind has been previously conjectured in either the physics or the mathematics literature .",
    "the appearance of the gff and its `` augmented '' variants is a particular surprise .",
    "( it implies that internal dla fluctuations  although very small  have long - range correlations and that , up to the curvature - related augmentation , the fluctuations in the direction transverse to the boundary of the cluster are of a similar nature to those in the tangential directions . ) nonetheless , the heuristic idea is easy to explain . before we state the central limit theorems precisely ( [ ss.twostatement ] and [ ss.generalstatement ] ) ,",
    "let us explain the intuition behind them .",
    "write a point @xmath29 in polar coordinates as @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 on the unit sphere",
    ". suppose that at each time @xmath1 the boundary of @xmath13 is approximately parameterized by @xmath33 for a function @xmath34 defined on the unit sphere .",
    "write @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the volume of the unit ball in @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath37 term measures the deviation from circularity of the cluster @xmath13 in the direction @xmath32 .",
    "how do we expect @xmath38 to evolve in time ? to a first approximation , the angle at which a random walk exits @xmath13 is a uniform point on the unit sphere .",
    "if we run many such random walks , we obtain a sort of poisson point process on the sphere , which has a scaling limit given by space - time white noise on the sphere .",
    "however , there is a smoothing effect ( familiar to those who have studied the continuum analog of internal dla : the famous hele - shaw model for fluid insertion , see the reference text @xcite ) coming from the fact that places where @xmath38 is small are more likely to be hit by the random walks , hence more likely to grow in time .",
    "there is also secondary damping effect coming from the mean curvature of the sphere , which implies that even if ( after a certain time ) particles began to hit all angles with equal probability , the magnitude of @xmath38 would shrink as @xmath1 increased and the existing fluctuations were averaged over larger spheres .",
    "the white noise should correspond to adding independent brownian noise terms to the spherical fourier modes of @xmath38 .",
    "the rate of smoothing / damping in time should be approximately given by @xmath39 for some linear operator @xmath40 mapping the space of functions on the unit sphere to itself .",
    "since the random walks approximate brownian motion ( which is rotationally invariant ) , we would expect @xmath40 to commute with orthogonal rotations , and hence have spherical harmonics as eigenfunctions . with the right normalization and parameterization , it is therefore natural to expect the spherical fourier modes of @xmath38 to evolve as independent brownian motions subject to linear `` restoration forces '' ( a.k.a .  ornstein - uhlenbeck processes ) where the magnitude of the restoration force depends on the degree of the corresponding spherical harmonic .",
    "it turns out that the restriction of the ( ordinary or augmented ) gff on @xmath24 to a centered volume @xmath1 sphere evolves in time @xmath1 in a similar way .    of course",
    ", as stated above , the `` spherical fourier modes of @xmath38 '' have not really been defined ( since the boundary of @xmath13 is complicated and generally _ can not _ be parameterized by @xmath41 ) . in the coming sections",
    ", we will define related quantities that ( in some sense ) encode these spherical fourier modes and are easy to work with .",
    "these quantities are the martingales obtained by summing discrete harmonic polynomials over the cluster @xmath13 .",
    "the heuristic just described provides intuitive interpretations of the results given below .",
    "theorem  [ t.fluctuations ] , for instance , identifies the weak limit as @xmath42 of the internal dla fluctuations from circularity at a fixed time @xmath1 : the limit is the two - dimensional augmented gaussian free field restricted to the unit circle @xmath43 , which can be interpreted in a distributional sense as the random fourier series @xmath44\\ ] ] where @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 are independent standard gaussians .",
    "the ordinary two - dimensional gff restricted to the unit circle is similar , except that @xmath49 is replaced by @xmath50 .",
    "the series  unlike its counterpart for the one - dimensional gaussian free field , which is a variant of brownian bridge  is a.s .",
    "divergent , which is why we use the dual formulation explained in [ ss.generalstatement ] . the dual formulation of amounts to a central limit theorem , saying that for each @xmath48 the real and imaginary parts of @xmath51 converge in law as @xmath52 to normal random variables with variance @xmath53 ( and that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are asymptotically uncorrelated for @xmath56 ) .",
    "see @xcite for numerical data on the moments @xmath55 in large simulations .      before we set about formulating our central limit theorems precisely , we mention a previously overlooked fact",
    ". suppose that we run internal dla in continuous time by adding particles at poisson random times instead of at integer times : this process we will denote by @xmath57 ( or often just @xmath58 ) where @xmath59 is the counting function for a poisson point process in the interval @xmath60 $ ] ( so @xmath59 is poisson distributed with mean  @xmath1 ) .",
    "we then view the entire history of the idla growth process as a ( random ) function on @xmath61 , which takes the value @xmath62 or @xmath63 on the pair @xmath64 accordingly as @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "write @xmath67 for the set of functions @xmath68 such that @xmath69 whenever @xmath70 , endowed with the coordinate - wise partial ordering .",

    "[ t.fkg ] _",
    "( fkg inequality ) _ for any two increasing functions @xmath73 , the random variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 are nonnegatively correlated .",
    "one example of an increasing function is the total number @xmath76 of occupied sites in a fixed subset @xmath77 at a fixed time @xmath1 .",
    "one example of a decreasing function is the smallest @xmath1 for which all of the points in @xmath78 are occupied .",
    "intuitively , theorem [ t.fkg ] means that on the event that one point is absorbed at a late time , it is conditionally more likely for all other points to be absorbed late .",
    "the fkg inequality is an important feature of the discrete and continuous gaussian free fields @xcite , so it is interesting ( and reassuring ) that it appears in internal dla at the discrete level .",
    "note that sampling a continuous time internal dla cluster at time @xmath1 is equivalent to first sampling a poisson random variable @xmath79 with expectation @xmath1 and then sampling an ordinary internal dla cluster of size  @xmath79 .",
    "( by the central limit theorem , @xmath80 has order @xmath81 with high probability . )",
    "although using continuous time amounts to only a modest time reparameterization ( chosen independently of everything else ) it is aesthetically natural .",
    "our use of `` white noise '' in the heuristic of the previous section implicitly assumed continuous time .",
    "( otherwise the total integral of @xmath38 would be deterministic , so the noise would have to be conditioned to have mean zero at each time . )      [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the restriction to harmonic @xmath82 ( as opposed to a more general test function @xmath83 ) seems to be necessary in large dimensions because otherwise the derivative of the test function along @xmath43 appears to have a non - trivial effect on ( see [ ss.fixedtimeproof ] ) .",
    "this is because has a lot of positive mass just outside of the unit sphere and a lot of negative mass just inside the unit sphere . it may be possible to formulate a version of theorem [ t.highdconvergence ] ( involving some modification of the `` mean shape '' described by @xmath84 ) that uses test functions that depend only on @xmath32 in a neighborhood of the sphere ( instead of using only harmonic test functions ) , but we will not address this point here . deciding whether theorem [ t.lateness ] as stated extends to higher dimensions requires some number theoretic understanding of the extent to which the discrepancies between @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( as well as the errors that come from replacing a @xmath86 with a smooth test function @xmath83 ) average out when one integrates over a range of times .",
    "we will not address these points here either .",
    "we may write a general vector in @xmath24 as @xmath30 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we write the laplacian in spherical coordinates as @xmath89 a polynomial @xmath90 $ ] is called _ harmonic _ if @xmath91 is the zero polynomial .",
    "let @xmath92 denote the space of all homogenous harmonic polynomials in @xmath93 $ ] of degree @xmath25 , and let @xmath94 denote the space of functions on @xmath95 obtained by restriction from @xmath92 . if @xmath96 , then we can write @xmath97 for a function @xmath98 , and setting to zero at @xmath99 yields @xmath100 i.e. , @xmath101 is an eigenfunction of @xmath102 with eigenvalue @xmath103 .",
    "note that continues to be zero if we replace @xmath25 with the negative number @xmath104 , since the expression @xmath105 is unchanged by replacing @xmath25 with @xmath106 .",
    "thus , @xmath107 is also harmonic on @xmath108 .    now , suppose that @xmath101 is normalized so that @xmath109 by scaling , the integral of @xmath110 over @xmath111 is thus given by @xmath112 . the @xmath113 norm on all of @xmath114 is then given by @xmath115    a standard identity states that the dirichlet energy of @xmath101 , as a function on @xmath95 , is given by the @xmath113 inner product @xmath116 .",
    "the square of @xmath117 is given by the square of its component along @xmath95 plus the square of its radial component .",
    "we thus find that the dirichlet energy of @xmath118 on @xmath114 is given by @xmath119    now suppose that we fix the value of @xmath118 on @xmath111 as above but harmonically extend it outside of @xmath114 by writing @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "then the dirichlet energy of @xmath118 outside of @xmath114 can be computed as    @xmath122    which simplifies to    @xmath123    combining the inside and outside computations in the case @xmath124 , we find that the harmonic extension @xmath125 of the function given by @xmath101 on @xmath95 has dirichlet energy @xmath126 .",
    "if we decompose the gff into an orthonormal basis that includes this @xmath125 , we find that the component of @xmath125 is a centered gaussian with variance @xmath127 .",
    "if we replace @xmath125 with the harmonic extension of @xmath128 ( defined on @xmath111 ) , then by scaling the corresponding variance becomes @xmath129 .",
    "now in the augmented gff the variance is instead given by , which amounts to replacing @xmath127 with @xmath130 .",
    "considering the component of @xmath128 in a basis expansion the space of functions on @xmath111 requires us to divide by @xmath131 ( to account for the scaling of @xmath118 ) and by @xmath132 ( to account for the larger integration area ) , so that we again obtain a variance of @xmath133 for the augmented gff , versus @xmath129 for the gff .    in some ways ,",
    "the augmented gff is very similar to the ordinary gff : when we restrict attention to an origin - centered annulus , it is possible to construct independent gaussian random distributions @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 such that @xmath134 has the law of a constant multiple of the gff , @xmath137 has the law of the augmented gff , and @xmath138 has the law of the ordinary gff .    in light of theorem [ t.fluctuations ] , the following implies that ( up to absolute continuity ) the scaling limit of fixed - time @xmath13 fluctuations can be described by the gff itself .

    "this implies that the relative entropy of @xmath140 with respect to @xmath139  restricted to the @xmath148th component @xmath149  is @xmath150 .",
    "the same holds for the relative entropy of @xmath139 with respect to @xmath140 . because the @xmath149 are independent in both @xmath140 and @xmath139 , the relative entropy of one of @xmath140 and @xmath139 with respect to the other",
    "is the sum of the relative entropies of the individual components , and this sum is finite .",
    "we recall that increasing functions of a poisson point process are non - negatively correlated @xcite .",
    "( this is easily derived from the more well known statement @xcite that increasing functions of independent bernoulli random variables are non - negatively correlated . )",
    "let @xmath140 be the simple random walk probability measure on the space @xmath151 of walks @xmath152 beginning at the origin .",

    "the construction described below is nearly the same as the one given by lovsz in  @xcite , except that we have tweaked it in order to obtain a smaller error term : if @xmath82 has degree @xmath165 , then @xmath166 has degree at most @xmath167 instead of @xmath168 .",

    "as outlined below , this will follow from the martingale central limit theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) .    for sufficiently large  @xmath311 , the difference @xmath344 is nonzero only for @xmath345 in the range @xmath346 ; and @xmath347 .",
    "we now show that this implies @xmath348 so that the martingale central limit theorem applies .    to prove , observe that @xmath349 where @xmath350 is the @xmath351th point of @xmath13 .",
    "then @xmath352 implies @xmath353 , and hence @xmath354 recalling that @xmath355 unless @xmath356 , we have @xmath357 which confirms .",
    "because @xmath13 fills the lattice @xmath265 as @xmath358 , we have @xmath359 we prove in three steps : replace @xmath360 by @xmath267 ( or @xmath361 if @xmath362 ) ; replace the lower limit @xmath363 by @xmath364 ; replace the sum of @xmath350 over lattice sites with the integral with respect to lebesgue measure in the complex @xmath350-plane .",
    "we begin the proof of by noting that the error term introduced by replacing @xmath258 with @xmath267 is @xmath365 in the integral this is majorized by @xmath366 since there are @xmath367 such terms , this change contributes order @xmath368 to the sum .",
    "next , we change the lower limit from @xmath363 to @xmath369 . since @xmath370 ,",
    "the integral inside @xmath371 is changed by @xmath372 thus the change in the whole expression is majorized by the order of the cross term @xmath373 again there are @xmath374 terms in the sum over @xmath350 , so the sum of the errors is @xmath375 .",
    "lastly , we replace the value at each site @xmath376 by the integral @xmath377 where @xmath378 is the unit square centered at @xmath376 and @xmath379 . because the square has area @xmath62 , the term in the lattice sum is the same as this integral with @xmath380 replaced by @xmath376 at each occurrence . since @xmath381 , @xmath382",
    "after we divide by @xmath383 , the order of error is @xmath384 .",
    "adding all the errors contributes at most order @xmath384 to the sum .",
    "we must also take into account the change in the lower limit of the integral , @xmath385 is replaced by @xmath386 . since @xmath381 , @xmath387 recall that in the previous step we previously changed the lower limit by @xmath388 .",
    "thus by the same argument , this smaller change gives rise to an error of order @xmath384 in the sum over @xmath376 .",
    "the proof of is now reduced to evaluating @xmath389 integrating in @xmath32 and changing variables from @xmath7 to @xmath390 , @xmath391 then change variables from @xmath1 to to @xmath392 to obtain @xmath393 this ends the proof of theorem [ gffdisk0 ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ gffdisk1 ] follows the same idea .",
    "we replace @xmath13 by the poisson time region @xmath394 ( for @xmath395 ) , and we need to find the limit as @xmath217 of @xmath396 the error terms in the estimation showing this quantity is within @xmath397 of @xmath398 are nearly the same as in the previous proof .",
    "we describe briefly the differences .",
    "the difference between poisson time and ordinary counting is @xmath399 .",
    "it follows that for @xmath400 , @xmath401 as in the previous proof for @xmath363 .",
    "further errors are also controlled since we then have the estimate analogous to the one above for @xmath13 , namely @xmath402 we consider the continuous time martingale @xmath403 instead of using the martingale central limit theorem , we use the martingale representation theorem .",
    "this says that the martingale @xmath404 when reparameterized by its quadratic variation has the same law as brownian motion .",
    "we must show that almost surely the quadratic variation of @xmath185 on @xmath405 is @xmath406 . @xmath407",
    "integrating with respect to @xmath345 gives the quadratic variation @xmath406 after a suitable change of variable as in the previous proof .",
    "theorem [ t.fluctuations ] follows almost immediately from the @xmath3 case of theorem [ t.highdconvergence ] and the estimates above .",
    "consider @xmath408 where @xmath409 is as in .",
    "what happens if we replace @xmath83 with a function @xmath410 that is discrete harmonic on the rescaled mesh @xmath411 within a @xmath412 neighborhood of @xmath413 ? clearly ,",
    "if @xmath83 is smooth , we will have @xmath414 .",
    "since there are at most @xmath415 non - zero terms in , the discrepancy in @xmath416 which tends to zero as long as @xmath417 .    the fact that replacing @xmath418 with @xmath409 has a negligible effect follows from the above estimates when @xmath3 .",
    "this may also hold when @xmath419 , but we will not prove it here .",
    "instead we remark that theorem [ t.fluctuations ] holds in three dimensions provided that we replace with , and that the theorem as stated probably fails in higher dimensions even if we make a such a replacement .",
    "the reason is that is positive at points slightly outside of @xmath420 ( or outside of the support of @xmath84 ) and negative at points slightly inside .",
    "if we replace a discrete harmonic polynomial @xmath82 with a function that agrees with @xmath82 on @xmath413 but has a different derivative along portions of @xmath43 , this may produce a non - trivial effect ( by the discussion above ) when @xmath421 .",
