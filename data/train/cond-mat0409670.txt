    "the investigation of the formation and the stationary properties of random structures has been an exciting topic in statistical physics for many years .",
    "since it provides an intuitively appealing and transparent model of the irregular geometry emerging in disordered systems , _ percolation _ has provided a leading paradigm for random structures .",
    "_ bond percolation _ constitutes perhaps the simplest percolation problem .",
    "two fundamental variants of bond percolation have been introduced in the past : in the _ isotropic percolation _ ( ip ) problem the bonds connecting the sites of a regular lattice ( in @xmath2 spatial dimensions ) are randomly assigned to be open ( with probability @xmath3 ) or blocked ( with probability @xmath4 ) , and an agent may traverse an open bond in either direction .",
    "in contrast , in the _ directed percolation _",
    "( dp ) problem the open bonds can be passed only from one of the two connecting sites , whence the allowed passage direction globally defines a preferred direction in space , see fig .",
    "[ dirper ] .        in these terms",
    ", percolation can be viewed as the passage of an agent through an irregularly structured medium , in the sense that the agent can propagate through certain regions , whereas it can not traverse other areas .",
    "though percolation represents one of the simplest models for random systems , it has in fact many applications .",
    "moreover , it yields a prototypical _ non - equilibrium phase transition _ : for small values of @xmath3 , regions with open bonds form disconnected clusters of typical linear extension @xmath5 , wherein the agent becomes localized or trapped . for @xmath6 , a critical threshold value for the frequency of open bonds ,",
    "the probability for the existence of an infinite connected accessible cluster becomes non - zero .",
    "therefore , an agent on an infinite cluster is not confined to a finite region of space any more , but may percolate through the entire system .",
    "this percolation transition defines a genuine _ critical phenomenon _ as encountered in equilibrium statistical mechanics , with @xmath5 providing the divergent length scale as @xmath7 is approached .",
    "it turns out that many , microscopically quite different percolation - type systems share their critical properties either with ip or dp .",
    "thus , the phase transitions in ip and dp , the latter distinguished from the former through the broken spatial isotropy , define genuine _",
    "universality classes_. for reviews on isotropic and directed percolation the reader is referred to refs .",
    "critical ip and dp clusters are shown in fig .",
    "[ perccl ] .",
    "= 6 truecm = 2.5 truecm    broadbent and hammersley @xcite first directed attention to the _ dynamics _ of percolation processes .",
    "in contrast to random diffusion , in percolation processes the spreading of agents is mainly governed by the disordered structure of the medium .",
    "consequently , they define stochastic growth processes where agents randomly generate offspring at neighboring sites , with rates determined by the susceptibility of the medium .",
    "the agents themselves decay spontaneously , thereby producing debris . in this way",
    "the medium becomes exhausted , and its susceptibility is randomly diminished .",
    "hence , static dp in @xmath8 spatial dimensions can be directly interpreted as a markov process in @xmath2 spatial and @xmath9 time dimension .",
    "the preferred ( propagation ) direction defines the temporal axis , and the history of the process yields the debris that forms the ( @xmath8)-dimensional spatially anisotropic _ directed _ percolation clusters .",
    "in contrast , in a _ dynamical isotropic percolation _ ( dip ) process the agents grow from a seed in an expanding stochastic annulus in @xmath2 spatial dimensions leaving behind the debris in their wake .",
    "this debris then forms @xmath2-dimensional _ isotropic _ percolation clusters .",
    "remarkably , the renormalized field theory of dp has appeared originally in elementary particle physics in the guise of _ reggeon field theory _",
    "grassberger et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that reggeon field theory is not a hamiltonian field theory but constitutes a stochastic process for which they coined the name _",
    "gribov process_. it represents a stochastic version of schlgl s ` first reaction ' @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the formal connection of reggeon field theory to dp was explicitly demonstrated @xcite , and janssen and grassberger stated the _ dp conjecture _ : the critical behavior of an order parameter field with markovian stochastic dynamics , decoupled from any other slow variable , that describes a transition from an active to an inactive , _ absorbing state _",
    "( where all dynamics ceases ) should be in the dp universality class @xcite .",
    "the field theory of dip was initiated by grassberger s formulation of the _ general epidemic process _ ( gep ) on a lattice , and his statement that near criticality this process produces isotropic percolation clusters @xcite .",
    "this insight led to the construction of the renormalized field theory for the dip universality class @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to express percolation processes in the language of an epidemic disease such as blight in a large orchard , the spreading of bark beetles in a forest , or proliferation of a forest fire , as depicted in fig .  [ waldbrand ] . here",
    ", the susceptible individuals or healthy trees form the medium , and the disease , blight , beetles , or fire represent the agent .",
    "the sick individuals , the befallen or burning trees may randomly infect neighboring individuals .",
    "the sick individuals are allowed to recover , becoming susceptible anew .",
    "this behavior defines the so - called _ simple epidemic process _ ( sep ) , also known as _ epidemic with recovery _",
    "properties of the sep near the ensuing critical point separating the endemic and pandemic phases ( whose precise location depends on the susceptibility of the individuals ) shares the universal properties of dp . in contrast , in a situation where the sick individuals die out or become immune as opposed to susceptible again , the medium is eventually exhausted .",
    "this scenario defines the _ general epidemic process _ ( gep ) , also termed _",
    "epidemic with removal _ @xcite .",
    "its universal properties are governed by the dip universality class .",
    "the statistical properties of the debris clusters that are left behind after the disease is extinguished are described by static ip .        in the recent physical literature ,",
    "basically two different methods have been employed to construct field theories of percolation processes .",
    "the first approach starts from a specific microscopic stochastic reaction - diffusion model formulated in terms of a master equation on a lattice .",
    "basically it consists of a description of the random walks generated by diffusing and reacting particles .",
    "a field theory is then obtained through a representation of the master equation by means of a bosonic creation / destruction operator formalism and introduction of coherent - state path integrals , followed by a naive continuum limit @xcite .",
    "the second method , to be applied in the first part of this article , takes a more universal , phenomenological perspective , and can be viewed as a dynamical analog of the established landau - ginzburg - wilson approach to static critical phenomena .",
    "it is based on formulating the fundamental principles shared by all systems in a given universality class , and directly employs a _",
    "stochastic continuum theory .",
    "of course , one has to a - priori define the slow dynamic fields in the theory , typically local densities of the order parameter and any conserved quantities , as characterizing the universality class under consideration .",
    "this approach assumes that on a mesoscopic scale the motion of the fast microscopic variables can be absorbed into the statistical properties of the stochastic equations of motion for the relevant slow variables .",
    "the corresponding stochastic processes should be markovian provided all slow variables are retained .",
    "taking into account the general ( symmetry , conservation , etc . )",
    "properties that define the universality class , the stochastic field theory is constructed using small - density and gradient expansions , i.e. , long - wavelength and low - frequency approximations that focus on the infrared ( ir ) properties of the system .    for percolation processes , the fundamental statement regarding the slow variables consists in the assertion that percolation near the critical point can be described by a markov process that only depends upon the density @xmath10 of activated sick parts of the medium and , in the case of dip , upon the density of the debris @xmath11 . in terms of the field",
    "@xmath12 the density of the debris is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes an appropriate kinetic coefficient .",
    "indeed , this assumption that percolation can be described solely in terms of @xmath12 becomes manifest in typical lattice simulations of such processes .",
    "near the critical point one observes a patchwork of regions consisting of _ correlated _ active neighboring sites and vacuum regions devoid of any activity .",
    "in stark contrast to this picture , simulations for branching and annihilating random walks show anticorrelating behavior , namely widely separated single active sites propagating on isolated paths and reacting only after encounter @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to formulate four principles that allow the explicit construction of a mesoscopic stochastic description of percolation processes .",
    "we shall describe the universal aspects of the dynamics of @xmath12 beginning with the dp universality class :    1 .",
    "the susceptible medium becomes locally infected , depending on the density @xmath12 of neighboring sick individuals .",
    "the infected regions recover after a brief time interval .",
    "the state with @xmath15 is absorbing .",
    "this state is equivalent to the extinction of the disease .",
    "3 .   the disease spreads out diffusively via the short - range infection ( i ) of neighboring susceptible regions .",
    "microscopic fast degrees of freedom may be captured as local noise or stochastic forces that respect statement ( ii ) , i.e. , the noise alone can not regenerate the disease .    for the dip universality class ,",
    "we need to modify principles ( i ) and ( ii ) by    1 .",
    "the susceptible medium becomes infected , depending on the densities @xmath12 _ and _ @xmath16 of sick individuals and the debris , respectively . after a brief time interval , the sick individuals decay into the immune debris .",
    "the debris ultimately stops the disease locally by exhausting the supply of susceptible regions .",
    "the states with @xmath15 and any spatial distribution of @xmath16 are absorbing .",
    "these states are equivalent to the extinction of the disease .",
    "it is important to realize that the mechanism ( i ) introduces _ memory _ into the stochastic process .",
    "note that we do not explicitly assume diffusive motion of the sick individuals .",
    "all that is needed is a spreading mechanism for the agent , here the disease itself : @xmath17 with a spreading probability @xmath18 that is assumed short - range , hence allowing to approximate its propagation by simple diffusion .",
    "however , this scenario by no means excludes reaction - diffusion systems where the `` infected '' particles themselves spread out diffusively , if otherwise the general percolation principles are satisfied .",
    "we proceed to set up the stochastic equations of motion for percolation processes according to the general principles formulated in the preceding section , @xmath19 or , in a discretized version ( in the it sense ) @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 here , @xmath23 denotes a random density that has yet to be constructed , and the second equations for @xmath16 only appear for the dip process . for simplicity we shall suppress spatial arguments in the following considerations .",
