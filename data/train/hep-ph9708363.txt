    "perturbation theory for gauge theories at finite temperature suffers from infrared singularities and gauge dependent results for physical quantities .",
    "these problems are avoided by using an effective perturbation theory ( braaten - pisarski method @xcite ) which is based on the resummation of hard thermal loop ( htl ) diagrams into effective green functions .",
    "this powerful method was derived within the imaginary time formalism ( itf ) .",
    "using resummed green functions , medium effects of the heat bath , such as debye screening , collective plasma modes , and landau damping , are taken into account .",
    "the htl resummation technique has been applied to a number of interesting problems , in particular to the prediction of signatures and properties of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) expected to be produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( for a review see @xcite ) .    however , the use of thermal field theories for describing a qgp in nucleus - nucleus collisions is restricted by the fact that at least the early stage of such a collision leads to a fireball , which is not in equilibrium .",
    "it is not clear if a complete thermal and chemical equilibrium will be achieved later on .",
    "hence , non - equilibrium effects in a parton gas should be considered for predicting signatures of qgp formation and for obtaining a consistent picture of the fireball .",
    "this can be done in the case of a chemically non - equilibrated parton gas by means of rate equations @xcite or more generally by using transport models @xcite",
    ". however , these approaches are based on a semiclassical approximation . in particular , infrared divergences have to be removed phenomenologically .",
    "therefore it is desirable to derive a green function approach including medium effects as in the case of the htl resummation . for this purpose",
    "one has to abandon the itf , which is restricted to equilibrium situations .",
    "the real time formalism ( rtf ) , on the other hand , can be extended to investigate non - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "the rtf involves choosing a contour in the complex energy plane which fulfills the kubo - martin - schwinger boundary condition and contains the real axis @xcite .",
    "this leads to propagators and self energies which are given by @xmath0 matrices .",
    "the choice of the contour is not unique .",
    "we will adopt the keldysh or closed time path contour , which was invented for the non - equilibrium case @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will demonstrate the usefulness of the keldysh representation @xcite based on advanced and retarded propagators and self energies and show how potentially dangerous terms ( pinch singularities ) @xcite in non - equilibrium are treated easily within this representation .    in the next section we review the keldysh representation . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the equilibrium calculation .",
    "we consider qed and give the results of the real time calculation , in the htl approximation , of the photon self energy , the resummed photon propagator , and the electron damping rate .",
    "the results are , of course , identical to those of the itf , which demonstrates that although the htl resummation scheme was derived within the itf , the result is independent of the choice of contour . in section 4 ,",
    "we extend the htl resummation technique to off - equilibrium situations by following the equilibrium calculations outlined in section 3 .",
    "we show that no pinch singularities appear in the non - equilibrium htl effective propagator .",

    "the distributions are given by f_b(p_0 ) & = & _ b n_b(p_0 ) , + f_f(p_0 ) & = & _ f n_f(p_0 ) , [ e46 ] where @xmath80 indicates undersaturation and @xmath81 oversaturation of the corresponding photons and fermions compared to an equilibrated qed plasma . using the distributions ( [ e46 ] ) we find for the constant @xmath66 in ( [ e42 ] ) after numerical integration @xmath82 .",

    "neq(p)= [ 1 + 0.096 ( 1-_f)]_eq(p ) . [ e47 ]    the non - equilibrium rate is independent of the photon fugacity @xmath83 and depends only weakly on @xmath84 .",
    "this observation is the result of a cancellation of two efects : in an undersaturated ( oversaturated ) plasma the number of scattering partners is reduced ( enhanced ) and , at the same time , the debye mass @xmath85 is reduced ( enhanced ) leading to less ( more ) screening . to a large extent , these two effects cancel each other and lead to a rate that is approximately independent of the fugacities . as a matter of fact , the non - equilibrium rate increases in an undersaturated plasma a little bit , because there is less pauli blocking in this case . in equilibrium the cancellation between the number of scattering partners ( flavors ) and the debye screening is exact @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we have studied explicitly the htl resummation technique in equilibrium and non - equilibrium within the rtf using the keldysh representation .",
    "we have considered the htl photon self energy , the resummed photon propagator , and the interaction rate of a hard electron in a qed plasma .",
    "we have pointed out the convenience of the keldysh representation , where only the symmetric propagators @xmath86 depend on the distribution functions and where possible pinch terms cancel automatically in equilibrium .",
    "we have shown that the htl resummation technique can be extended to non - equilibrium situations assuming quasistationary distributions .",
    "this assumption does not allow us to study the equilibration of the system ; it restricts us to the study of microscopic processes taking place in an out of equilibrium background under the assumption that the time scale of this microscopic process is much smaller than the time scale of the relaxation of the background towards equilibrium .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the htl expansion .",
    "htl propagators and vertices describe the physics of modes with momenta of the order of @xmath57 times the hard momentum scale or larger .",
    "the damping rates which determine the relaxation time of the system are of order @xmath56 times the hard momentum scale .",
    "equilibration is therefore slow , at least close to equilibrium , and quasistationary distributions can be assumed . in relativistic heavy ion collisions , for example",
    ", we expect a fast thermalization @xcite , which could not be described by our method , and a much slower chemical equilibration @xcite where our approach should be applicable @xcite .",
    "the retarded and advanced htl photon self energies in non - equilibrium are obtained from the equilibrium quantity by replacing the thermal mass of the photon by a non - equilibrium expression ( [ e35 ] ) .",
    "the retarded and advanced resummed photon propagators have the same structure as their equilibrium counterparts .",
    "however , the resummed symmetric photon propagator @xmath87 ( [ e38 ] ) contains an additional term ( pinch term ) compared to the equilibrium expression ( [ e24 ] ) .",
    "this singularity is regulated by the resummed propagators in the pinch term in ( [ e38 ] ) .",
    "one obtains an expression ( [ e43 ] ) for the htl effective propagator that has the same structure as the equilibrium result ( [ e26 ] ) .",
    "therefore , there are no additional pinch singularities in htl effective propagator in the non - equilibrium formalism , compared with the equilibrium situation .",
    "we have discussed how to extend these results beyond leading order by an additional resummation beyond the htl one .",
    "higher n - point functions could also be calculated efficiently using the keldysh representation @xcite .",
    "we expect that the absence of pinch singularities persists .",
    "since the htl self energies are gauge invariant out of equilibrium ( since they differ from the equilibrium htl s only by the definition of the thermal masses ) , we expect that ward identities will hold out of equilibrium @xcite , and thus the structure of all htl green functions should be the same both in and out of equilibrium .    as an example we have discussed the interaction rate of a hard electron and showed that the result has the same form out of equilibrium as in equilibrium .",
    "( we note that this discussion of pinch singularities has no bearing on the infrared divergence that occurs in the htl calculation of this quantity ) .",
    "we have considered a chemical non - equilibrium situation by multiplying the equilibrium distribution functions by a fugacity factor .",
    "the non - equilibrium interaction rate is approximately independent of the fugacities .    using the formalism developed in this paper",
    ", it will be straightforward to calculate observables in a non - equilibrium parton gas .",
    "examples that have already been considered in an equilibrated qgp include parton damping and transport rates , the energy loss of partons , transport coefficients , and production rates of partons , leptons , and photons ."
