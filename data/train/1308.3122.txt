    "there are three main sources of rrl emission in our galaxy : hii regions , diffuse ionized gas , and photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "hii regions are zones of plasma surrounding massive young stars .",
    "astrophysical rrls were first detected toward the omega hii region in 1964 .",
    "these observations were reported by @xcite and @xcite , and shortly afterward , were followed by high sn rrl detections toward orion and m17 @xcite .",
    "there have been many subsequent rrl surveys of hii regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "hii regions are the most intense sources of recombination line emission , although at low frequencies diffuse ionized gas becomes a relatively bright source of rrl emission ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    in the galaxy ,",
    "the diffuse ionized gas consists of a low density component ( @xmath19 1 @xmath20 ) referred to as the warm ( t@xmath21 @xmath22 3000 to 8000 k ) ionized medium ( wim ) .",
    "this component has a scale height of @xmath22 1000 pc and is usually studied using optical recombination lines and pulsar dispersion measures @xcite .",
    "observations of low - frequency ( @xmath19 a few ghz ) rrls have established the presence of another diffuse ionized component with density in the range 1 to 10 @xmath20 close to the galactic plane and with a scale height of @xmath22 100 pc @xcite . in the literature , this component is referred to as galactic ridge rrl emission by @xcite , extended low density medium ( eldm ) by @xcite , evolved hii region by @xcite , hii envelopes by @xcite and @xcite ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , extended low - density warm ionized medium ( eldwim ) by petuchowski & bennett ( 1993 ) and heiles ( 1994 ) and warm ionized medium by heiles et al .",
    "following mezger ( 1978 ) , in the present paper , this diffuse ionized component is referred to as eldm .",
    "recently , extensive higher angular resolution ( @xmath23 ) rrl observations of the eldm were made by @xcite .",
    "they found that the distribution of the eldm is strongly correlated with the location of galactic hii regions , confirming the observations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the origin of the eldm is , however , still unclear , in large part because previous studies have used low - resolution observations .",
    "one possibility is that it originates from the ionization of low density regions surrounding giant hii regions , from which photons `` leak''(see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion on the w43 region ) although this scenario does not fit all observations @xcite .",
    "in addition to hydrogen lines , carbon rrls have been detected in several directions in the galaxy .",
    "they are generally observed from interfaces between neutral and fully ionized regions , referred to as pdrs .",
    "photons with wavelengths longer than the lyman limit can escape the hii region and ionize carbon and other atoms of lower ionization potential than hydrogen .",

    "the survey of ionized gas in the galaxy , made with arecibo ( siggma ) will fully sample the entire galactic plane observable with the 305-m william e. gordon telescope at the arecibo observatory ( @xmath0 and @xmath24 in the inner galaxy ; @xmath25 and @xmath2 in the outer galaxy ) , and will be the most sensitive large scale rrl survey ever made . the survey data will permit a wide range of science , including : 1 ) studies of hii regions , planetary nebulae , and novae ; 2 ) the galactic temperature ; 3 ) the large scale structure of the milky way ; 4 ) carbon recombination line emitting regions ; and , 5 ) possibly the eldm .",
    "rrls can distinguish between thermal and non - thermal sources . in the section of the inner galactic plane observable with the arecibo telescope",
    "there are thousands of continuum sources that are revealed by the l - band nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) @xcite .",
    "to date only a few hundred hii regions have been identified in this zone @xcite . with a much greater sensitivity than existing surveys",
    ", siggma will detect hydrogen rrls in sources with peak line intensities @xmath26 1.5 mjy ( 3@xmath27 threshold ) .",
    "hii regions are ideal tracers of spiral arm structure in galaxies .",
    "siggma will offer a large - area sample of galactic hii regions which , together with the alfa hi survey of the galactic plane @xcite , will permit a comprehensive study of galactic structure and kinematics within the galactic longitude range @xmath28 .",
    "this survey will also be useful to check the current velocity field models of the galaxy since a rotation curve for the 4.5 to 8  kpc galactocentric distance range can be derived from the data .",
    "@xcite found , for the first time , that the average electron temperatures ( t@xmath21 ) of hii regions gradually increase with galactocentric radius r in the galaxy .",
    "the same trend of t@xmath21 was also obtained by @xcite who directly related this to the metallicity gradient with r. using high angular resolution rrl observations toward ultra - compact hii ( uchii ) regions , @xcite derived the slope of temperature gradient with r to be 320 k kpc@xmath8 .",
    "@xcite directly determined the metal abundance in these uchii regions using ir fine structure line observations .",
    "they show , for the first time , that the inferred temperature gradient from the measured metallicity gradient is consistent with that obtained using rrl observations . however , the slope of the electron temperature gradient obtained from data towards uchii regions is shallower than that determined from data toward classical hii regions @xcite .",
    "the difference in slope obtained from the two sets of observations needs to be resolved .",
    "moreover , there is still a considerable scatter both in the temperature and metal abundance gradients .",
    "this scatter is partly due to local metal abundance anomalies produced by supernovae and winds from evolved stars , but also due to measurement errors along with uncertainties associated with the estimation of the distance to the objects .",
    "the high sensitivity of siggma will help to improve the estimation of the electron temperature gradient from the data toward hii regions",
    ".    we will also be able to measure rrls from heavier elements , such as carbon .",
    "maps of carbon rrl emission in a variety of sources can be used to study pdrs and to test pdr models .",
    "siggma can make a greate contribution to the study of pdrs because the arecibo telescope has the sensitivity to map carbon rrls in a substantial number of sources having a wide range of metallicities .",
    "siggma can help to improve our understanding on the origin and ionization of the eldm since , owing to its high spatial resolution and high sensitivity , it will map the eldm up to latitudes of @xmath29 , thus allowing us to associate it with individual hii regions .    in summary , we expect the data products and results from siggma to be comparable with those obtained from other surveys such as 2mass ( the two micron all sky survey , * ? ? ?",

    "siggma uses the arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) receiver on the arecibo telescope .",
    "the alfa receiver has 7 independent beams , each recording two orthogonal linear polarizations .",
    "the beams are arranged in a hexagonal pattern such that there is one central beam ( beam 0 ) surrounded by six outer beams ( beams 1 - 6 ) . due to the optics of the telescope ,",
    "the outer beams are projected onto an ellipse in the sky .",
    "this ellipse is centered on beam 0 and has semi - axes of @xmath30 in zenith angle by @xmath31 in azimuth .",
    "the orientation of the long axis of the ellipse changes with parallactic angle .",
    "although the array is derotated during observations , the positions of the outer beams change on the sky due to the elliptical projection .",
    "this change of outer beams with respect to beam 0 is typically less than the fwhm of the beam width .",
    "the average fwhm of the beams varies between @xmath32 across our frequency range .",
    "the footprint of all the beams on the sky , out to the ellipse enclosing the fwhm of the outer beams , is ( @xmath33 ) , covering an area of 163  241 sq .",
    "the area falling within the fwhm of the beams is 53  78 sq .",
    "arcmin . , or around a third of the total foot print .",
    "the gain of beams 1 - 6 is @xmath22 8.5 kjy@xmath8 , while beam 0 has a gain of @xmath34 kjy@xmath8 .",
    "all seven beams have measured system temperatures of 27 - 28 k at low zenith angles ( @xmath35 ) where most of our observations will occur , giving a system equivalent flux density of @xmath22 2.5 jy for beam 0 and @xmath22 3.2 jy for beams 1 - 6 .",
    "the receiver has a bandwidth of 300 mhz , covering 1225 - 1525 mhz .",
    "spectra are recorded once per second using the mock spectrometer , a fourier - transform device which has 2 groups , each of 14 boards .",
    "this enables it to process data from the 7 alfa beams , each of which is divided into two if sub - bands .",
    "the first group is used in a high time - resolution , low spectral - resolution mode to obtain data for the commensal ` p - alfa ' pulsar survey @xcite , while the second group is used to acquire data simultaneously for the rrl survey .",
    "each if sub - band covers 172 mhz , with the first if centered at 1450 mhz and the second if centered at 1300 mhz .",
    "together , these cover the entire 300 mhz alfa bandpass , with the filter roll - off being either in the overlap region between the two sub - bands , or outside the band of the receiver .    for the rrl survey , data are accumulated for 1 s before being fourier transformed to form spectra of 8192 channels per if sub - band .",
    "this gives a spectral resolution of 21 khz , equivalent to 4.2 - 5.1 kms@xmath8 for the hn@xmath11 recombination lines within the alfa bandpass .",
    "the required integration time is then built up from multiple 1 s spectra .",
    "the survey uses a ` leapfrog'-style observing technique @xcite with a grid of points that repeat along lines of constant declination ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "each observation integrates on each position for 270 s ( 180 s in the outer galaxy ) .",
    "combined with the slew time , this gives a spacing of nearly 5 min between observations . by choosing pointings from the grid with the same declinations and separated by 5 minutes in right ascension ,",
    "we track the same azimuth and zenith angle in consecutive points .",
    "this allows consecutive points to be used as on - off pairs in order to form a bandpass - corrected ( on - off)/off spectrum ( see section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "the 5 minutes separation in time between on and off points provides the best baselines because ripples caused by internal reflections in the antenna , ground pick up , and atmospheric effects mostly cancel out in the corrected spectrum .",
    "the survey tiling pattern is made up of clusters of three pointings that are offset from each other by one beam fwhm beamwidth , labeled as the north ( n ) , central ( c ) and south ( s ) pointings in figure 1 .",
    "this is a modification of the original p - alfa pulsar survey tiling pattern @xcite , with the axis of the pattern ( and of the alfa receiver ) rotated by 19 degrees to celestial north so that adjacent clusters of pointings fall on lines of constant declination . by leapfrogging through this tiling pattern ,",
    "the survey covers approximately 10 sq .",
    "deg . of sky in 100  h of telescope time . in the outer galaxy , where siggma is commensal with the alfa zone of avoidance survey ( alfa zoa ) , integration times per pointing are shorter but",
    "the pattern is observed three times with a small offset ( @xmath36 ) in order to make a nyquist - sampled map of 10 sq .",
    "deg . of sky to similar depth in 200  h of telescope time .",
    "the entire 300 mhz bandpass of the rrl survey observations is divided into two if sub - bands . examples of the spectra of the two sub - bands are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "the two orthogonal polarizations are averaged for each sub - bandpass , thereby achieving @xmath37 increase in sn , but rendering the data insensitive to polarization .    after matching the on / off pointing pairs ,",
    "we perform bandpass correction to the raw on / off spectral pairs via the customary position switched method of ( on - off)/off @xmath38 tsys .",
    "bandpass corrected spectra are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "it is clear that the rfi in the higher frequency if sub - band is considerably less serious than in the case of the lower if band .",
    "we separate each 300 mhz spectrum into 12 segments , each of which covers @xmath39300  kms@xmath8 centered between the rest frequencies of the hn@xmath11 and hen@xmath11 lines such that the hn@xmath11 and hen@xmath11 lines are offset by + 61  kms@xmath8 and @xmath4061  kms@xmath8 , respectively , from the band center and the cn@xmath11 line is offset @xmath4088 kms@xmath8 from the band center .",

    "<S> a survey of ionized gas in the galaxy , made with the arecibo telescope ( siggma ) uses the arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) to fully sample the galactic plane ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) observable with the telescope in radio recombination lines ( rrls ) . </S>",
    "<S> processed data sets are being produced in the form of data cubes of @xmath3 ( along @xmath4)@xmath5(along @xmath6)@xmath7 ( number of channels ) , archived and made public . </S>",
    "<S> the 151 channels cover a velocity range of 600 km s@xmath8 and the velocity resolution of the survey changes from 4.2 km s@xmath8 to 5.1 km s@xmath8 from the lowest frequency channel to the highest frequency channel , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> rrl maps with @xmath9 resolution and line flux density sensitivity of @xmath10  mjy will enable us to identify new hii regions , measure their electron temperatures , study the physics of photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) with carbon rrls , and investigate the origin of the extended low density medium ( eldm ) . </S>",
    "<S> twelve hn@xmath11 lines fall within the 300 mhz bandpass of alfa ; they are resampled to a common velocity resolution to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( sn ) by a factor of 3 or more and preserve the line width . </S>",
    "<S> siggma will produce the most sensitive fully sampled rrl survey to date . </S>",
    "<S> here we discuss the observing and data reduction techniques in detail . </S>",
    "<S> a test observation toward the hii region complex s255/s257 has detected hn@xmath11 and cn@xmath11 lines with sn @xmath12 10 . </S>"
