    "networks of interacting agents such as humans , computers , animal species , proteins , and neurons have been investigated vigorously .",
    "they are typically complicated , meaning that their structures are far from absolutely regular or entirely random .",
    "two principal quantities characterizing networks are the average shortest path length @xmath0 and the clustering coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "the number of edges in the shortest path averaged over all vertex pairs defines @xmath0 .",
    "most real networks have small @xmath0 , namely @xmath2 or even less , where @xmath3 is the number of vertices .",
    "the local clustering coefficient is the normalized number of connected triangles containing a specific vertex .",
    "if the vertex degree is @xmath4 , or there are @xmath4 edges adjacent to the vertex , the normalization factor is @xmath5 .",
    "this quantity averaged over all the vertices defines @xmath1 , and real networks usually have large @xmath1 .",
    "a small @xmath0 and a large @xmath1 can not be simultaneously realized either by lattices , trees , or the ordinary random graphs @xcite .",
    "then , watts and strogatz proposed the small - world networks that fulfill these requirements at the same time @xcite .",
    "another important observation is that not all but many real networks have power - law degree distributions @xmath6 , typically with scaling exponent @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the small - world networks are short of the scale - free property . in light of this ,",
    "barabsi and albert ( ba ) proposed a network model that generates scale - free networks with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "two essential features of the ba model are ( i ) network growth realized by sequentially adding vertices and edges , and ( ii ) preferential attachment , meaning that newly introduced edges are more prone to be linked to vertices with larger @xmath4 . since the proposal of the ba model , its various extensions and related models , such as the fitness model and the hierarchically growing models , have been presented .",
    "these models are successful in incorporating more realistic aspects of networks including tunable @xmath9 and large @xmath1 that the original ba model actually lacks @xcite .    to sum up , some ba - type models and hierarchical networks own large @xmath1 , small @xmath0 , and scale - free @xmath10 . however , real scale - free networks are not necessarily growing . the number of vertices may not change greatly over time for networks of friends , companies , interacting proteins , and neurons , to name a few . in view of this , a class of nongrowing scale - free networks has been studied in which whether edges are created relies on interaction of vertices with intrinsic weights @xcite .",
    "weights represent the fitness of vertices to win edges @xcite and are interpreted as , for example , capitals , social skills , activity levels , information contents , concentration or mass of physical or chemical substances , and the vertex degree itself .",
    "the role of such vertex fitness was argued in growing models as well @xcite . to our surprise , scale - free @xmath10 emerges even from weight distributions devoid of power laws @xcite . as a remark ,",
    "if an edge exists when the sum of two vertices weights exceeds a prescribed threshold , the network is equivalent to the so - called threshold graph @xcite .",
    "this case eases analytical treatments .",
    "our focus in this paper is the geographical extension of the nongrowing scale - free networks , which has been overlooked so far .",
    "actually , real networks are often embedded in topological spaces .",
    "even the internet , in which the speed of information transmission is technically independent of the physical distance , is subject to geographical constraints because of wiring costs @xcite . in addition , it is often advantageous to map nonphysical quantities or networks into geographical spaces by , for example , the principal component analysis . then , influence of the distance between graduated traits is questioned .",
    "in fact , the watts - strogatz small - world network already addressed this issue since it is constructed on lattice substrates @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath11 the probability that two vertices with distance @xmath12 are connected . in lattice networks supplied with additional edges , where @xmath13 , generated networks have small @xmath0 when @xmath14 is smaller than a critical value @xcite",
    ". otherwise , global connections are too scarce to elicit the small - world property .",
    "the same is true for growing scale - free networks .",
    "although the ba model is irrelevant to embedding spaces , which is actually the main cause for small @xmath1 , it has been extended to incorporate underlying geographical spaces and @xmath15 .",
    "then , a transition from the scale - free to nonscale - free regime as well as one from small @xmath0 to large @xmath0 occurs at a certain @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "although @xmath11 plays a key role in determining the network structure , characterization of @xmath11 in real - world networks still seems controversial . in applications such as the internet routing @xcite and neural networks @xcite ,",

    "exponential decays are also inferred from biological neural networks @xcite",
    ". however , many other data are in favor of @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , a recent extensive analysis of the internet concludes @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "power laws also hold for macroscopic connectivity of brain regions identified by correlated activities [ @xmath17 @xcite and for microscopic neural networks @xcite . in social sciences , evaluating @xmath11 seems more difficult because of presumably larger noises . accordingly",
    ", both power - law and exponential forms of @xmath11 have been inferred , sometimes even from identical data @xcite . in the face of the ambiguity of available data , it is worthwhile to examine models to see how various types of @xmath11 affect network properties to help interpret real data .    in the context of nongrowing geographical networks , there is an algorithm that generates @xmath18 with a prescribed @xmath9 @xcite .",

    "in contrast , @xmath8 is an important phase - transition point for percolation and dynamic epidemic processes @xcite .",
    "the ba model has @xmath8 , which may set the baseline @xmath9 for other competitive growing networks @xcite .",
    "our current speculation stems from the ansatz @xmath254 plugged into the results obtained from other models .",
    "further investigation of this issue is an important future problem .",
    "we have proposed and analyzed a geographical nongrowing network model based on thresholding the sum of two vertex weights .",
    "our model contrasts with geographical growing models based on the ba model , and it naturally extends the threshold graph , the unit disk graph , and the gravity model , which are widely used in a range of fields . in proper regimes , small - world networks with scale - free degree distributions and the connection probability algebraically decaying in distance are generated , and they are consistent with many real data .",
    "in contrast to the nongeographical threshold model , what weight distribution is used matters for network properties . for scale - free networks to emerge , the weight should be distributed as specified by power laws .",
