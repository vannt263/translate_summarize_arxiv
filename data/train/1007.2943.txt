    "in the recent ten years , the successful running of @xmath9 factories babar and belle has provided rich experimental data for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which has confirmed the kobayashi - maskawa cp asymmetry mechanism in the standard model ( sm ) and also shown hints for new physics ( np ) . among the rich phenomena of @xmath9 decays , the decay modes of @xmath9 mesons into pairs of charmless mesons are the known effective probes of the cp violation in the sm and are sensitive to potential np scenarios beyond the sm .",
    "the two body charmless @xmath12 decays will play the similar role in studying the cp asymmetries ( cpa ) , determining ckm matrix elements and constraining / searching for the indirect effects of various np scenarios .",
    "recently the cdf collaboration at fermilab tevatron has made the first measurement of charmless two - body @xmath13 decay @xcite @xmath14 the measurement is important for understanding @xmath15 physics , and also implies that many @xmath15 decay modes could be precisely measured at the lhc - b .",

    "@xcite , based on the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite , the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite , and the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite , respectively , one would find the experimental measurement of this branching ratio agrees with the sm predictions with scet @xcite , but lower than the predictions with qcdf and pqcd @xcite .",
    "for the cdf measurement of @xmath16 , its central value favors a large cp violation in @xmath17 decay ( different from 0 at @xmath18 ) , although it is also compatible with zero . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a robust test of the sm or a probe of np is suggested by comparison of the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath0 decay .",
    "the decays @xmath19 , @xmath2 have been extensively studied in the literatures ( for example , refs .",

    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is an extension of the sm which emerges as one of the most promising candidates for np beyond the sm . in susy ,",
    "supersymmetric version of the sm contributes to the flavor change natural current ( fcnc ) processes .",
    "the flavor - changing in these processes is intrinsically tied to usual ckm - induced flavor - changing of the sm ( if that were the only new source of flavor physics , we would say the model is minimally flavor violating ) .",
    "but general susy is not minimally flavor violation . for general susy ,",
    "a new source of flavor violation is introduced by the squark mass matrices , which usually can not be diagonalized on the same basis as the quark mass matrices .",
    "this means gluinos ( and other gaugios ) will have flavor - changing couplings to quarks and squarks , which implies the fcncs are mediated by gluinos and thus have strong interaction strength . in order to analyze the phenomenology of non - minimally flavor violating interactions in general susy framework , it is helpful to rotate the effects so that they occur in squark propagators rather than in couplings , and to parameterize them in terms of dimensionless mass insertion ( mi ) parameters @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in this paper",
    ", we work in the usual mi approximation @xcite , and consider @xmath30 , @xmath2 decays , in general susy models , where flavor violation due to the gluino mediation can be important .",
    "the chargino - stop and the charged higgs - top loop contributions are parametrically suppressed relative to the gluino contributions , and thus are ignored following @xcite . in our work",
    ", we also discuss the implications of @xmath4 mixing since the relevant mi parameters , that affect @xmath30 , @xmath2 decays , enter also in @xmath4 mixing .",
    "we consider the lr , rl , ll and rr four kinds of the mis .",
    "we find that for @xmath3 , our predictions including the lr or rl mi effects are compatible with the measurements of @xmath31 decay and @xmath4 mixing within @xmath5 ranges , and the constrained both lr and rl mis could significantly affect the polarization fractions of @xmath32 decay . while the constrained ll and rr insertions from @xmath4 mixing can not explain the possible large cp asymmetry and the small branching ratio of @xmath33 because of lacking the gluino mass enhancement in the decay .",
    "therefore , with the ongoing @xmath9-physics at tevatron , in particular with the onset of the lhc - b experiment , we expect a wealth of @xmath12 decay data and measurements of these observables could restrict or reveal the parameter spaces of the lr and rl insertions in the near future .",
