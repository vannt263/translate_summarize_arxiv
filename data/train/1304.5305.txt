    ".125 in    the classical falconer distance conjecture states that if a set @xmath8 , @xmath9 , has hausdorff dimension greater than @xmath10 , then the one - dimensional lebesgue measure @xmath11 of its distance set , @xmath12 is positive , where @xmath13 denotes the euclidean distance .",
    "falconer gave an example based on the integer lattice showing that the exponent @xmath10 is best possible .",
    "the best results currently known , culminating almost three decades of efforts by falconer @xcite , mattila @xcite , bourgain @xcite , and others , are due to wolff @xcite for @xmath14 and erdoan @xcite for @xmath15 .",
    "they prove that @xmath16 if @xmath17    it is natural to consider related problems , where distances determined by @xmath2 may be replaced by other geometric objects , such as triangles @xcite , volumes @xcite , angles @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "generally , if @xmath18 for some @xmath19 , we define a configuration set @xmath20 and ask how large @xmath21 needs to be to ensure @xmath22 . for example , in the distance problem , @xmath23 ; in the volume problem , @xmath24 ; in the angle problem , @xmath25 .",

    "we say a shpere is determined by a set @xmath2 if it is determined by a @xmath26-tuple @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be the radius of the unique @xmath1-dimensinal sphere determined by @xmath27 and it equals @xmath31 if such a sphere does not exist or it is not unique .",
    "we obtain two types of results .",
    "first , we estimate how often a neighborhood of a given radius occurs , in the sense defined below .",
    "second , we find the optimal dimension such that the lebesgue measure of the set of radii is positive .",
    "our main geometric results are the following .",

    "in contrast to the incidence result , using mattila s classical estimate on the dimension of intersections ( see theorem [ mat84 ] ) , one can prove that @xmath39    it s the optimal result because there is no unique @xmath1-dimensional sphere passing through @xmath40 points in a hyperplane .",
    "however , one can never get this bound by improving the incidence result above due to its sharpness .",
