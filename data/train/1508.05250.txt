    "16 ( en ) lacertae @xmath5 hr8725 ( b2iv , @xmath65.59 ) , a member of lac ob1a , is a single - lined spectroscopic binary @xcite and an eclipsing variable . the orbital period , derived from the epochs of minimum light , @xmath712.09684 d @xcite .",
    "the system consists of a well - known @xmath0  cephei variable and an undetected secondary .",
    "the @xmath0 cephei variation of the primary is dominated by three pulsation modes with frequencies close to 6 d@xmath8 . according to (",
    "* henceforth f69 ) , who based his analysis on archival 1951 , 1952 and 1954 radial - velocity and photoelectric blue - light observations , the first two modes have constant amplitudes , while the amplitude of the third mode varies on a time scale of months .",
    "f69 described the first two modes as singlets , having frequencies @xmath95.91134 and @xmath105.85286 d@xmath8 , and the third mode as a doublet , consisting of two terms with frequencies @xmath115.49990 and @xmath125.49799 d@xmath8 .",
    "comparable frequencies were derived from the 1964 and 1965 photoelectric observations , obtained by one of us ( mj ) at lowell observatory , viz .",
    "@xmath135.91120@xmath140.00005 , @xmath105.85503@xmath140.00010 , and @xmath155.50322@xmath140.00009 d@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the first value agrees with that of f69 , but the other two differ from f69 s @xmath16 and @xmath17 by 0.0022 and 0.0033 d@xmath8 , respectively . from these differences ,",
    "@xcite concluded that f69 s values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 suffered from an error of one cycle per year ( yr@xmath8 ) .",
    "an analysis of all photometric observations of 16 lac obtained throughout 1992 was carried out by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth jp96 , jp99 ) .",
    "the main results of the analysis can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the amplitudes of the @xmath18 and @xmath16 modes vary on a time - scale of decades , the reciprocal time - scales amounting to 0.014 and 0.020 yr@xmath8 , respectively , ( 2 ) the third mode is confirmed to be a doublet , but with frequencies different from those derived by f69 , viz .",
    "@xmath195.5025779@xmath140.0000005 and @xmath205.5040531@xmath140.0000008 d@xmath8 .",
    "note that none of these frequencies bears a simple numerical relation to the orbital period .",
    "moreover , jp96 demonstrated that there is no correlation of the pulsation amplitudes with the orbital phase .",
    "the radial - velocity ( rv ) data available at the time were shown by jp96 to be consistent with the above - mentioned photometric results .",
    "the rv data , however , were much less numerous than the photometric data , making this conclusion somewhat uncertain . the situation has improved after ( * ? ? ? * henceforth l01 ) , provided new rv observations , more than doubling the number of existing measurements .",
    "a periodogram analysis of these and the older data led l01 to a number of frequency solutions , the details of which depended on the weights assigned to the rv measurements from a particular source . as far as the periods are concerned , the results valid for all weighting schemes can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the first mode is an equidistant triplet with the central term having the largest amplitude and a period , @xmath21 , equal to 0.16916707  d ( @xmath95.9113160 d@xmath8 ) .",
    "the remaining two periods , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the notation of l01 , are equal to 0.16916605 and 0.16916809 d , respectively .",
    "the frequency separation of the triplet amounts to 0.0000356 d@xmath8 , corresponding to the amplitude - modulation frequency of 0.0130 yr@xmath8 , ( 2 ) the second mode is a doublet ; in the order of decreasing amplitude , the periods , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the notation of l01 , are equal to 0.17085553 and 0.17077074 d , respectively ( @xmath105.8528981 and @xmath265.8558041 d@xmath8 ) , resulting in a beat period of 344 d ( the beat frequency of 0.00291 d@xmath8 ) , ( 3 ) the third mode is also a doublet ; in the order of decreasing amplitude the periods are @xmath270.18173251 and @xmath280.18168352 d ( @xmath155.5025928 and @xmath295.5040765 d@xmath8 ) ; in this case the beat period is equal to 674 d. conclusions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) approximately agree with the results of jp96 and jp99 , but conclusion ( 2 ) does not .",
    "the disagreement is twofold .",
    "first , the time - scale of the amplitude modulation of the @xmath16 term derived by l01 is less than one fiftieth of that derived by jp96 and jp99 .",
    "second , l01",
    "s @xmath16 , i.e.  the frequency of the higher - amplitude component of the @xmath16 , @xmath30 doublet has a value close to that originally determined by f69 and dismissed by @xcite as a yearly alias of the photometric @xmath16 value they derived .",
    "note that @xmath16 of @xcite is close to @xmath30 , the frequency of the smaller - amplitude component of the @xmath16 , @xmath30 doublet .",
    "this , of course , is the consequence of the doublet s beat - period having its value close to 1 yr .",
    "in addition to the three modes just discussed , six fainter terms were detected by @xcite in his 1965 data .",
    "the @xmath31 amplitudes of these terms ranged from 2.1@xmath140.14 to 0.7@xmath140.14 mmag , and the frequencies were equal to ( in the order of decreasing amplitude ) 0.1653 , 7.194 , 11.822 , 11.358 , 11.414 , and 11.766 d@xmath8 .",
    "the first of these is equal to twice the orbital frequency , suggesting ellipsoidal variability .",
    "however , the observed amplitude and phase excluded this possibility .",
    "the third frequency is equal to 2@xmath18 and the three last frequencies are the combination terms @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the 7.194-d@xmath8 term was attributed by @xcite to an independent pulsation mode and was used as such , together with the three strongest ones , in an asteroseismic study of the star @xcite .",
    "subsequently , however , this term was shown by @xcite and @xcite to be due to a light variation of 2 andromedae , used by @xcite as a comparison star .    during a multisite photometric campaign carried out between 2 august 2003 and 9 january 2004",
    ", 16 lac has been observed together with the @xmath0 cephei variable 12 ( dd ) lacertae .",
    "results of the observations of 12 lac and their analysis were published some years ago @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the 2003 - 2004 multisite campaign s photometric observations and reductions . in section 3 , we carry out a frequency analysis of the campaign s @xmath1 time - series of 16 lac . in section 4",
    "we use the analysis results to remove the intrinsic component of the variation from the time - series , thus bringing out the eclipse , and discuss the eclipse solutions and the evolutionary state of the secondary component . in section 5 , we derive the primary component s fundamental parameters .",
    "section 6 is devoted to determining the harmonic degree of the three highest - amplitude pulsation modes of 16 lac .",
    "the long - term variation of the photometric amplitudes and phases of these three modes is investigated in section 7 using the present and archival data .",
    "the last section contains a summary and discussion of the results .",
    "the light variation of 2 and is examined in the appendix .",
    "our 2003 - 4 photometric observations of 16 lac were carried out at ten observatories on three continents with small- to medium - sized telescopes ( see table 1 ) . in most cases ,",
    "single - channel differential photoelectric photometry was acquired . at the sobaeksan optical astronomy observatory ( soao ) and the biakw observatory ( bo )",
    "the photometry was done with ccd cameras .",
    "wherever possible , strmgren @xmath1 filters were used . at the sierra nevada and san pedro martir ( spm )",
    "observatories simultaneous @xmath35 photometers were available , including @xmath36 filters as well . however , the @xmath37 data from spm were unusable . at bo ,",
    "a strmgren @xmath31 filter was used . at four observatories where no strmgren filters were available we used johnson s @xmath38 . finally , as the photometer at the mercator telescope had geneva filters installed permanently , we used this filter system .",
    "we chose the two ` classical ' comparison stars : 10 lac ( o9v , @xmath64.88 ) and 2 and ( a3vn , @xmath65.09 ) . a check star , hr8708 ( a3vm+f6v , @xmath65.81 ) ,",
    "was additionally observed during one of the spm runs .",
    "( f5 , @xmath67.31 ) was used as a comparison star at soao ; its constancy was checked against two fainter stars . at bo ,",
    "bd+404950a = ppm63607 = gsc3223@xmath3901835 ( f5/k0 , @xmath69.29 ) was used as a sole comparison star . in order to compensate for the large brightness difference between the program and the comparison star ( @xmath403.7 mag ) , bo observers took a sequence of ccd frames with short and long exposure - times , such that 16 lac",
    "was well exposed on the frames with short exposure - times , while the comparison star , on the frames with long exposure - times .",
    "reductions of the soao and bo observations included calibrating all ccd frames in a standard way and processing them with the daophot ii package @xcite .",
    "then , magnitudes were obtained by means of aperture photometry , the magnitudes of the comparison stars were interpolated for the times of observation of 16 lac and differential magnitudes were calculated . in the case of the bo data ,",
    "several consecutive data points were averaged , resulting in the final time - series .        given the spectral type of a3vn and the period of the variability , one would immediately suspect that the light variations of 2 and are due to @xmath41  scuti - type pulsation .",
    "in fact , the star was so classified by @xcite . however , if 2  and were a @xmath41  scuti variable , the amplitudes are generally expected to increase from @xmath31 to @xmath42 and from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , and then level out or drop again towards @xmath37 and @xmath45 ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "interestingly , just the inverse is the case . in the following we investigate possible causes for this observation .",
    "2 and is not a single star .",
    "it is a close visual binary discovered over a century ago @xcite .",
    "the two components are physically associated .",
    "the latest determination of the orbital period is 74 yr with an eccentricity of 0.8 and a semimajor axis of 0.23@xcite .",
    "transforming the tycho-2 photometry of the two components @xcite , to the standard johnson system according to @xcite gives : @xmath465.24 mag , @xmath470.07 mag for 2 and a , and @xmath487.51 mag , @xmath490.23 mag for 2 and b. therefore @xmath505.113 mag and @xmath510.086 mag , in reasonable agreement with the measured @xmath65.100 mag and @xmath520.094 mag for the system @xcite .",
    "the revised _ hipparcos _",
    "parallax of 2 and @xcite implies a distance of 129@xmath149  pc .",
    "concerning reddening , a comparison of the results from the galactic reddening law of @xcite for 2 and , and the reddening of two stars within 4@xmath53 of 2 and in the sky , at a similar _ hipparcos _ distance ( hr8870 and hd218394 ) lead us to adopt @xmath540.022@xmath140.022 mag and @xmath550.07@xmath140.07 mag .",
    "we then arrive at @xmath560.39@xmath140.16 mag for 2 and  a and 1.88@xmath140.16 mag for 2 and b. the relations of @xcite yield estimates of @xmath578950@xmath14250  k and @xmath580.45@xmath140.16 mag for 2 and a , and 7720@xmath14250  k and 1.85@xmath140.16 mag for 2 and b. the positions of the two components are shown in a theoretical hr diagram in fig .  [ figa2 ] .",
    "the evolutionary tracks plotted in this figure were computed with the warsaw - new jersey stellar evolution code , the opal equation of state and the opal opacity tables @xcite , a hydrogen abundance of @xmath590.7 , a metal abundance of @xmath600.012 @xcite , and no convective core overshooting .",
    "we assumed @xmath61 250  km  s@xmath8 on the zero - age main sequence , so that the observed @xmath62212 km  s@xmath8 @xcite would be approximately matched .",
    "one finds that 2 and a is an @xmath632.7@xmath140.1  m@xmath64 star that probably has already left the main sequence ( @xmath653.40@xmath140.12 , @xmath668.57@xmath140.04 ) . including core overshooting would decrease @xmath67 and the age but @xmath68 would remain virtually unchanged . 2 and a is located off the @xmath41  scuti instability strip . 2 and b is situated in the centre of the strip ( @xmath631.78@xmath140.06  m@xmath64 , @xmath693.90@xmath140.16 , @xmath668.84@xmath70 ) .    with these parameters in hand",
    ", we shall test four possible hypotheses to explain the cause of the variability of 2 and : @xmath41  scuti pulsation or ellipsoidal variability , of either 2 and a or 2 and b. rotational modulation can be excluded immediately because either star would have to rotate faster than its breakup velocity .    regarding the hypothesis of @xmath41  scuti pulsation , we computed theoretical pulsation amplitudes of @xmath41  scuti models for the strmgren and geneva passbands in the parameter ranges depicted in fig",
    ".  [ figa2 ] for an assumed radial velocity amplitude , using the methodology by @xcite .",
    "we note that whilst computing realistic absolute amplitudes is still out of reach , amplitude _ ratios _ are easily obtainable .",
    "we computed theoretical pulsation amplitudes of @xmath41  scuti models for the strmgren and geneva passbands . from the flux ratio of 2 and a to 2 and b in the @xmath31 band ( estimated from @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) and the observed @xmath31 amplitude from table a1 we then determined the undiluted photometric amplitudes of 2 and a and 2 and b in the strmgren @xmath31 band , ( @xmath73 0.0022 and 0.0215 mag , respectively ) , and used the model amplitudes to predict the intrinsic amplitudes in the other bands .",
    "as the next step , we determined the flux ratio of the two components of 2 and in the different passbands . to this end , we used @xcite model atmospheres , representing 2 and a with a @xmath579000  k , @xmath693.5 model atmosphere , and 2 and b with a @xmath747750  k , @xmath694.0 model atmosphere .",
    "we then integrated the monochromatic fluxes from these model atmospheres over the ten photometric passbands used , and scaled the resulting fluxes to the observed ratio in @xmath31 .",
    "the results of these computations can be summarized as follows : the behaviour of the pulsation amplitudes with wavelength is inconsistent with the observations for any kind of assumed pulsation of 2 and a. the reason is that the temperature of the star is so high , that the pulsation amplitudes always increase towards shorter wavelength , no matter which spherical degree of the pulsation was tested ( we checked for @xmath75 ) .",
    "the additional flux of 2 and b does not change this behaviour due to the considerable luminosity difference .",
    "assuming that 2 and b was a @xmath41 scuti pulsator , and considering the amplitude contamination due to the light of 2 and a , we find that the observed pulsation amplitude vs. wavelength dependence is only consistent with modes of even spherical degree of @xmath76 .",
    "we recall that in such a scenario the intrinsic pulsation amplitude of 2 and b in the strmgren @xmath31 band , @xmath77 is 0.0215 mag .",
    "geometric cancellation of modes with @xmath78 decreases the observed amplitudes to less than 1/50 of the intrinsic value @xcite , i.e. the intrinsic pulsation amplitude would be enormous in this case .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath41 scuti pulsation of either of the two a - type stars in the 2 and system as highly unlikely .",
    "a remaining possibility is an ellipsoidal variation of either component .",
    "consequently , we repeated the previous procedure under the assumption of no colour dependence of the amplitude .",
    "we found that the resulting wavelength - amplitude dependence explains the observations much better than the @xmath41 scuti - pulsation hypothesis .",
    "this implies an orbital period of twice the observed value . using the effective temperatures , the luminosities and the masses derived above we find from the kepler s third law that in the case of 2 and a the sum of the radii of the components aa and ab , @xmath79",
    ", would be a factor of about 2 greater than the semimajor axis of the relative orbit , @xmath80 , regardless of whether we assume ( 1 ) equal luminosity and mass components , or ( 2 ) the secondary component much fainter and less massive than the primary component .",
    "in the case of 2 and b , assumption ( 1 ) leads to @xmath81 1.5@xmath80 , while assuming ( 2 ) one gets @xmath821.0@xmath80 .",
    "thus , an ellipsoidal variation of 2 and b , arising from a tidal distortion of component ba by a much less massive secondary component bb in a tight orbit may be the cause of the variability of 2 and .    in order to examine the last possibility let us use the lowest order approximation , certainly adequate in the present case , according to which the amplitude of the light variation due to aspect changes of the tidally distorted primary can be expressed by means of the following formula : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is expressed in magnitudes ,",
    "@xmath85 is the photometric distortion parameter of @xcite , @xmath86 is the mass ratio of the components , and @xmath87 is the inclination of the orbit to the tangent plane of the sky .",
    "we note that this formula is equivalent to equation ( 6 ) of @xcite . neglecting the light variation of the secondary",
    ", we have @xmath88 . then , taking into account the fact that in the present case @xmath891 , we get @xmath900.013 and 0.052 for @xmath9190and 30 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding masses of the secondary component are equal to @xmath400.03 and @xmath400.11 m@xmath64 , i.e.  they are in the range of the masses of brown dwarfs .",
    "thus , our hypothesis that 2 and b is an ellipsoidal variable leads to the following model : the 2 and bb component is a brown dwarf in a tight orbit around 2 and ba , a late a or an early f star .",
    "the amplitude of the rv variation , @xmath92 , would be equal to 10 and 20 km  s@xmath8 for @xmath9190 and 30 , respectively . according to the ephemeris provided by @xcite ,",
    "the separation of the components a and b will be 0.135 in 2014 january , decreasing to 0.046by 2018 . in the near future",
    ", it will be thus impossible to get a spectrogram of 2 and b without an overwhelming contribution from 2 and a. consequently , measuring the rv of 2 and b may be very difficult ."
