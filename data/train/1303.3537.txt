    "the continuous - time quantum walk , the quantum analog of a continuous - time markov process , was introduced by farhi and gutmann  @xcite and extended by them and childs  @xcite .",
    "numerous algorithms based on the quantum walks were soon developed that were shown to be more efficient than the best - known classical algorithms  @xcite . among these are quantum walk search algorithms , based both on the discrete - time quantum walk  @xcite and on the continuous - time quantum walk  @xcite . in these approaches , the set corresponds to the vertices of a graph , and the marked element is one distinguishable vertex .",
    "while the spatial search time attains the optimal scaling on most graphs , including the complete graph , complete bipartite graphs , @xmath5-partite graphs  @xcite , the hypercube  @xcite , the johnson graph  @xcite , and regular lattices with dimension equal to three or greater  @xcite , it remains at best @xmath6 for quantum walks on the two - dimensional square lattice despite much effort  @xcite , and @xmath2 in one dimension .",

    "quantum walks have also been implemented with single neutral @xmath10cs atoms  @xcite confined in optical lattices  @xcite .    because the behavior of quantum walks is governed by quantum interference , it is not necessary to restrict physical systems to single walkers .",

    "one might therefore conjecture that the timescale for the quantum search problem could be modified by the presence of nonlinearity .",

    "in the continuous - time quantum walk , the state of the quantum walker @xmath12 is evolved in time by the action of the hamiltonian @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the laplacian operator and @xmath15 is the transition amplitude .",
    "given an @xmath0-dimensional graph @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 correspond to the set of vertices and edges respectively , one can define the laplacian as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the adjacency matrix associated to the graph @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a diagonal matrix whose elements are @xmath23 , the degree of vertex @xmath24 ( the inclusion of the diagonal is not needed if the graph is regular ) .",
    "the adjacency matrix specifies the graph connectivity and its matrix elements are defined as @xmath25 in the continuous - time quantum walk , one associates each vertex @xmath24 to a basis vector @xmath26 ; the set of basis vectors spans the @xmath0-dimesional hilbert space .",
    "the state of the quantum walker is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are time - dependent complex coefficients .",
    "the quantum walk is then effected by performing the unitary transformation @xmath29 on the particle state vector ( @xmath30 is set to unity in this work ) .    in the continuous - time quantum walk search algorithm of childs and goldstone  @xcite , one of the basis vectors @xmath31 is treated differently .",
    "this is accomplished by introducing a marking or oracle hamiltonian : @xmath32 the quantum state is then evolved according to the total hamiltonian @xmath33 , i.e.  @xmath34 .",
    "it was shown that if the initial state is chosen to be the uniform superposition of all sites @xmath35 then there exists a time @xmath36 and value of @xmath15 for which the probability on the marked site @xmath37 will attain unity .",
    "for the complete graph , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "for the hypercube and an @xmath5-dimensional square lattice for @xmath40 , the search time remains @xmath41 .",
    "a convenient starting point for the description of interacting becs is the gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite @xmath42 \\psi({\\bf r},t ) , \\label{eq : gp}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is some time - independent external potential , @xmath44 is the particle interaction strength , and @xmath45 is the bec wavefunction .",
    "all of the @xmath46 bosons are assumed to be in the same single - particle state , so the normalization condition is @xmath47 .",
    "it is convenient to define the bec wavefunction in terms of a new wavefunction @xmath48 so that latexmath:[$\\int d{\\bf r }     consider functions @xmath43 corresponding to a series of @xmath0 potential energy wells , each centered at @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "a simple example in one dimension would be @xmath52 in a box of length @xmath14 , where @xmath53 is some arbitrary length scale and @xmath54 ; if @xmath55 is an integer , the potential minima are found at @xmath56 with @xmath57 positive integers and @xmath58 .",
    "if the confinement is sufficiently strong , the particles comprising the bec will be completely confined to the sites of the potential @xmath43 ; reducing the confinement would then allow tunneling between nearby sites .",
    "the bec wavefunction can then be expanded in a basis of wannier functions @xmath59 localized to the sites , @xmath60 . inserting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) , multiplying on the left by @xmath61 and integrating over all space gives @xmath62 where @xmath63w({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}_j)\\ ] ] is the amplitude to tunnel between sites centered at @xmath50 and @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the on - site interaction strength . in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp2 ] ) , the wannier functions are assumed to be orthonormal , and to be so strongly localized that the spatial integrals of four wannier functions are insignificant unless all their arguments are the same .",
    "for all the analytical calculations in this work , we will make the further simplifying assumption that @xmath66 for all nearest neighbors @xmath67 and that the particle interactions are site - independent @xmath68 . for mean field theory to remain valid , one requires @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the site coordination number ( vertex degree ) in the limit @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "for the complete graph @xmath72 with @xmath73 vertices investigated in the present work , each vertex has @xmath74 neighbors .",
    "mean - field theory therefore requires @xmath75 which is easy to satisfy for large @xmath0 .",
    "the discrete gp equation can then be written @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the matrix elements of the graph adjacency matrix @xmath78 defining the connectivity of the sites . for graphs with constant degree ( i.e.site valency ) @xmath79 , the laplacian is @xmath80 .",
    "because a constant energy offset can not change the dynamics , the bec wavefunction is equivalently described by the gp hamiltonian @xmath81 which generates time evolution via the usual schr \" odinger equation @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "the non - linear quantum walk search hamiltonian then takes the following form : @xmath84 for example , in ultracold atom experiments an individual site of an optical lattice could in principle be ` marked ' by modifying the local potential using single - site addressing  @xcite .",
    "the simplest ( though not the only ) way to guarantee that @xmath85 is to assume that @xmath86  constant for all nearest neighbors @xmath67 .",
    "the dimension @xmath87 of a graph @xmath21 is defined as the smallest number @xmath22 for which the graph satisfying this property can be embedded in @xmath22-dimensional euclidean space @xmath88 .",
    "for the special case @xmath89 these graphs are called unit - distance graphs ; examples include cycles , regular two - dimensional lattices , and hypercubes .",
    "of course , the three - dimensional regular lattice also has dimension @xmath90 .",
    "the complete graph @xmath72 with @xmath73 vertices investigated in the present work unfortunately has dimension @xmath91  @xcite ; the vertices form a @xmath22-simplex arranged over the @xmath22-dimensional hyperspherical surface of circumradius @xmath92 with fixed distance @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "this makes the direct physical realization of the complete graph connectivity via a potential energy function @xmath43 challenging unless a three - dimensional embedding can be found . in principle",
    "this might be possible by varying the positions of the physical sites while simultaneously changing the potential barrier heights .",
    "a much simpler approach would likely be to pursue a photonic implementation employing passive optical elements such as multiple beam splitters  @xcite .",
    "the complete graph is nevertheless interesting from a purely theoretical perspective .",
    "consider the action of the hamiltonian  ( [ hsearch ] ) for the @xmath0-vertex complete graph @xmath72 .",
