    "the phenomenon of noise - induced escape from a metastable state , and the related phenomenon of noise - induced transitions between the stable states of a bistable system , occur in many places in the sciences and engineering  @xcite .",
    "our focus in this paper is the case when the system on which the noise acts has nontrivial spatial extent , and the noise is not spatially uniform , but has significant spatial dependence .",
    "this case arises in numerous physical contexts , in both equilibrium and non - equilibrium systems .",
    "examples of noise - induced transitions in spatially extended systems include pattern formation in convective and electroconvective systems far from equilibrium  @xcite , thermally activated magnetization reversal in nanomagnets  @xcite , vortex creep in superconductors  @xcite , the growth of instabilities in metallic nanowires  @xcite , and many others .",
    "possibly the simplest mathematical model of a spatially extended system undergoing a noise - induced transition is a ginzburg ",
    "landau scalar field theory perturbed by weak spatiotemporal noise . even here , the mathematical complexity of the problem has restricted most treatments to the case of one spatial dimension .",
    "the phenomenon of classical nucleation on a line was treated by langer  @xcite in a seminal paper , and a closely related quantum phenomenon was treated by callan and coleman  @xcite . in  the limit as the size of the one - dimensional spatial domain tends to infinity , they were able to compute ( respectively ) the nucleation rate per unit length , and what amounts to a tunnelling rate per unit length .",
    "their work has been widely applied and cited .",
    "however , many practical applications require an understanding of the phenomenon of noise - induced nucleation in systems with a spatial extent that is both nonzero and non - infinite , and the extent to which the nucleation rate per unit length depends on system size .",
    "noise - induced transitions between the two stable states of a bistable nonlinear field theory , in a finite - volume domain , have been investigated by several authors  @xcite .",
    "the difference between finite and infinite systems is not merely quantitative .",
    "recently , the authors  @xcite uncovered an unusual effect , akin to a phase transition , that occurs in an overdamped classical ginzburg ",
    "landau field theory with a bistable @xmath0 potential , as the length  @xmath1 of its one - dimensional spatial domain is varied .",
    "a  similar phenomenon had previously been seen in a quantum context  @xcite . the lowest - energy",
    "` saddle ' between the two stable configurations , through which noise - activated transitions preferentially occur ( especially when the noise strength is low ) may bifurcate .",
    "below a critical length  @xmath2 , this transition state is a spatially constant field configuration , but at  @xmath3 it bifurcates into a spatially varying pair of configurations , degenerate in energy .",
    "subsequent work  @xcite shows that a similar bifurcation occurs in a ginzburg  landau model with an asymmetric potential ,",
    "in which the two new spatially varying transition states are not degenerate ; so one or the other is preferred .",
    "the ` phase transition ' at a critical length @xmath2 is therefore reasonably robust .",
    "so at a critical system size , there may occur a major change in the phenomenology of noise - induced transitions between the stable states of a ginzburg ",
    "landau field theory , which proceed via nucleation . associated with the bifurcation of the transition state is a bifurcation of the mpep ( most probable escape path , i.e. , transition path in configuration space ) extending uphill from each stable state to the transition state .",
    "the bifurcation is driven by this preferred nucleation pathway becoming unstable in the transverse direction .",
    "as  one would expect , the transition rate is strongly affected by the bifurcation .",
    "formally , the prefactor in the kramers ( weak - noise ) nucleation rate _ diverges _ at  @xmath3 .",
    "this signals that precisely at @xmath3 , the phenomenon of transition between the two stable states becomes non - arrhenius : the rate at which it occurs falls off in the limit of weak noise not like an exponential ( with a constant prefactor ) , but rather like an exponential with a power - law prefactor .    our paper ref .",
    "@xcite computed the kramers prefactor as a function of  @xmath1 , through the bifurcation , by using elliptic functions .",
    "the use of higher transcendental functions made it possible to treat the case @xmath4 , i.e. , to go beyond the analyses of langer , and callan and coleman .",
    "however , we considered in  detail only the case when dirichlet conditions are imposed on the ginzburg ",
    "landau field at the endpoints of the spatial domain .",
    "how sensitive is the occurrence of a phase transition at some @xmath3 to the boundary conditions employed ?",
    "we examine this question here , by extending our qualitative results and nucleation rate computations to the cases of neumann , periodic , and antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "we  shall show that the phase transition is robust to changes in boundary condition , but that unsurprisingly , there are quantitative differences among the various cases .",
    "examination of these differences will permit us to present our methods in more detail , and provide further insights into the behavior of noise - activated transitions in spatially extended systems .",

    "the same is true of the neumann case .",
    "hence these two latter cases will have the same activation energy in the @xmath9 limit , just as the periodic and antiperiodic values for  @xmath11 converge in this limit ; and it will be the energy of a single @xmath0 kink .    _",

    "it  is easy to see that in the case of a two - dimensional order parameter , in which there are only two eigenvalues at each stationary state , ( [ eq : prodeig ] )  reduces to the eyring formula  ( [ eq : eyring ] ) .",

    ", they may diverge .",
    "however , their _ ratio _ , defined in a limiting sense , will generally be finite .",
    "it is often not possible to compute in closed form the eigenvalue spectrum of the linearized zero - noise dynamics at the relevant stationary points ( although an exception will be seen below ) . to  employ standard techniques for prefactor computation",

    "it  is worth mentioning that a similar schrdinger operator arises in the analyses of langer and callan  coleman .",
    "however , since they considered only the limit @xmath9 , which corresponds to @xmath85 , the ` potential energy ' in their schrdinger operators involves hyperbolic trigonometric functions rather than elliptic functions . for a careful review ,",

    "finally , we compute the single negative eigenvalue @xmath57 of  @xmath60 $ ] , which is associated with downhill motion away from the transition state  @xmath39 .",
    "it is easy to check that the corresponding eigenfunction is @xmath103 in physical terms , this eigenfunction specifies the way in which a droplet pair configuration in the neumann model begins to collapse , due to the boundary between the positive and negative droplets , which is a kink initially localized at  @xmath104 ( see fig .",
