    "the cold collapsing process has been extensively studied as a crucial relaxation process of the collisionless systems such as elliptical galaxies where the stellar encounters are unimportant .",
    "after the violent cold collapse , a steady state is generally formed , whose density profile is well described by the de vaucouleurs s @xmath0 law @xcite . the spherical averaged density profile is found to be @xmath1 in spherical cold collapses@xcite and is found to be @xmath2 in the cluster - pair collision @xcite .",

    "after the spherical collapse and the cluster - pair collision , kanaeda and morikawa showed that the velocity distribution of all bound particles becomes non - gaussian@xcite which is described by the superposed - gaussian .    from a viewpoint of statistical mechanics , we can not naively expect the ordinary gaussian distributions for sgs , because the the long - range interaction of gravity apparently _ violates additivity _ , which is the basic standpoint of the ordinary boltzmann statistical mechanics@xcite .",
    "then the question is whether we can expect any universal distribution function for sgs instead of the gaussian distribution .    as one of the possible explanations for these non - gaussian distributions in the stationary state with large fluctuations of intensive quantities such as temperature , beck and cohen@xcite proposed the superstatistics .",
    "according to this proposal , statistical properties of the temperature fluctuations determine overall non - gaussian distributions .",
    "a special choice of the fluctuation leads to the tsallis statistics@xcite .",
    "however , it is clear that the non - gaussian properties of sgs are _ not always observed _ everywhere in the universe .",
    "moreover non - gaussian properties of sgs are quite diverse in general and we can not expect the completely universal properties of sgs .",
    "for example , we studied non - gaussian properties in the self - gravitating ring model@xcite , where many self - gravitating particles are constrained to move on a circular ring , which is fixed in the three - dimensional space . only at the intermediate energy scale where the specific heat becomes negative , only the _ halo _ particles which belong to the intermediate energy scale ,",
    "have shown non - gaussian and power law velocity distribution : @xmath3 . in this model ,",
    "the existence of the _ halo _ particles plays an essential role in the appearance of non - gaussian distributions . in our present paper",
    "therefore , we would like to clarify _ in which aspect of sgs and under which conditions the universal non - gaussian properties are observed_.    non - gaussian properties would be more naturally expected for the collisionless stage of the evolution ( @xmath4 ) than the later collisional stage of sgs ( @xmath5 ) , where @xmath6 is a local two - body relaxation time@xcite ( in this paper , @xmath6 is defined by eq.([t_rel ] ) ) .",

    "release of the gravitational energy at the center would yield a steady heat flow toward the outskirts of the system .",
    "this flow may guarantee the two properties we found in this paper and their duration .",
    "we hope we can report the detail very soon .    in this paper , we paid attention only to the velocity distribution function .",
    "however , we need the information of matter configuration like density profile to understand the full characteristic of gravitationally bound systems in quasi - equilibrium state",
    ". we will show that the combination of the local virial condition and the linear mass - temperature relation leads to a universal density profile for gravitationally bound systems in a separate report @xcite .",
    "this information should give a hint for the origin of the universality profile of dark matter or elliptical galaxies like de vaucouleurs law @xcite .",
    "in our previous work@xcite , we have studied the self - gravitating ring model and have obtained a non - gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "this velocity distribution shows a power law and is apparently different from the results obtained in this paper .",
    "we believe that this discrepancy originates from the difference of the boundary conditions . in the self - gravitating ring model ,",
    "the configuration space is compact . on the other hand , in the present simulation",
    ", the configuration space is open .",
    "we would like to extensively consider the effect of boundary conditions soon .    in this work , we restricted our models only to the spherical collapses and the cluster - pair collisions .",
    "however actual galaxies may undergo much more diverse evolution processes including chemical evolution , the environment effects , and a possible special nature of the cold dark matter .",
    "so the actual observational possibility of the universality we found for astronomical objects should be further investigated .",
    "the authers would like to thank professor kei - ichi maeda for the extensive discussions .",
    "all numerical simulations were carried out on grape system at adac ( the astronomical data analysis center ) of the national astronomical observatory , japan .",

    "<S> the velocity distribution of the resultant quasi - stationary state generally becomes non - gaussian . through the strong mixing of the violent process , there appears a universal non - gaussian velocity distribution , which is a democratic ( equal - weighted ) superposition of many gaussian distributions ( dt distribution ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is deeply related with the local virial equilibrium and the linear mass - temperature relation which characterize the system . </S>",
    "<S> we show the robustness of this distribution function against various initial conditions which leads to the violent gravitational process . </S>",
    "<S> the dt distribution has a positive correlation with the energy fluctuation of the system . on the other hand , the coherent motion such as the radial motion in the spherical collapse and the rotation with the angular momentum suppress the appearance of the dt distribution . </S>"
