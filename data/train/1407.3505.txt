    "barred - spiral galaxies often host star - forming nuclear rings at their centers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these rings are most likely produced by the radial infall of gas at large radii caused by angular momentum loss due to its nonlinear interactions with an underlying stellar bar potential ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "they appear smaller in more strongly barred galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and unrelated to resonances with the bars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the ring location is determined primarily by the amount of angular momentum loss rather than the resonances , as confirmed by numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "large gas surface density and small dynamical timescale of nuclear rings make them one of the most intense star forming regions in disk galaxies .",
    "observations indicate that the star formation rate ( sfr ) in a nuclear ring varies widely from galaxy to galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although the total gas content in a ring is similar at @xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "data presented in @xcite and @xcite suggest that strongly barred galaxies tend to have a small sfr , while weakly barred galaxies have a wide range of sfr at @xmath3 .",
    "ring star formation appears to be long lived , occurring either continuously @xcite or episodically @xcite for @xmath4 . in some galaxies ,",
    "young star clusters exhibit an azimuthal age gradient such that they tend to be older farther away from the contact points between a ring and dust lanes , while there is no noticeable age gradient in many other galaxies ( e.g , @xcite ) . yet , what determines the ring sfr as well as the presence or absence of the azimuthal age gradient along a ring is not clearly understood .    in a recent attempt to understand these observational results , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) ran hydrodynamic simulations for star formation occurring in nuclear rings of barred galaxies without spiral arms , and found that the ring sfr is controlled mainly by the mass inflow rate to the ring rather than the total gas mass in the ring . in these bar - only models , the massive gas inflows caused by the bar growth",
    "result in a strong burst phase of sfr that lasts only for @xmath5 gyr , after which both the mass inflow rate and sfr are decreased to very small values below @xmath6 .",
    "the main reason for this short burst of star formation is that only the gas inside the bar region ( more precisely , inside the outermost @xmath7 orbit ) can respond to the bar potential to initiate the rapid gas infall , while the gas outside the bar is not much affected by the bar potential ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "paper  i also found that an azimuthal age gradient of young star clusters is expected when the sfr is less than a critical value affordable at the contact points .",
    "these bar - only models may explain ring star formation in galaxies with low sfr , but would require that the bars should be dynamically young in galaxies with high sfr , which is quite unlikely since the lifetime of bars is quite long ( several gyrs ) in observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath8-body simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the mass inflow rate to the ring is really a critical factor in determining the ring sfr , long - lived star formation requires that fresh gas should be supplied to the nuclear rings continually or continuously .",
    "there are several additional gas - feeding mechanisms at work in real galaxies that may change the temporal evolution of the sfr considerably .",
    "these include galactic fountains ( e.g , @xcite ) , cosmic accretion of primordial gas ( e.g , @xcite ) , and angular momentum dissipation by spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite estimated the gas infalling rates of @xmath9 and @xmath10 for ngc 891 and ngc 2403 , respectively , most of which was ejected to the halos via supernova ( sn ) feedback , while @xcite found high velocity clouds feed a normal galactic disk with gas at a rate of @xmath11 . since the gas supply in the form of fountains and cosmic accretion occurs over a whole disk plane , the accreted gas should make its way to the galaxy center anyway to help promote star formation in the rings .",
    "very recently , @xcite showed that stellar spiral arms can play such a role , transporting the gas inward at a rate @xmath12 depending on the arm strength and pattern speed , which can potentially enhance the ring sfr .    in this paper , we investigate star formation in a nuclear ring of a disk galaxy that possesses both spiral arms and a bar .",
    "this is a straightforward extension of paper  i that considered only the bar potential . by varying the arm strength and pattern speed while fixing the bar parameters , we quantity the effect of the spiral arms on the ring sfr and gaseous structures that form . in section [ sec : modmeth ]",
    ", we describe our galaxy models and numerical method . in section [ sec : res ]",
    ", we present the results on overall evolution of our galaxy models , star formation occurring in nuclear rings , and age gradients of star clusters .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section [ sec : sum ] .",

    "there is a well - defined , elongated gaseous feature , called a gaseous inner ring , that lies inside the outermost @xmath7 orbit and encompasses the dust lanes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the inner ring has roughly the same size as the bar ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as explained in paper  i , it begins to form after dust lanes find their equilibrium positions by collecting the residual gas that did not experience the dust - lane shocks . in model f10p20 , however , the inner ring is strongly perturbed by the arm - induced mass inflows at late time .",
    "it is also influenced by feedback from star formation in the nuclear ring .",

    ", the mass infalls from the bar ends to the ring occur intermittently , resulting in episodic star formation in the ring at late time .",
    "since the typical inflow velocity due to the arms is @xmath92 @xcite , the arm - induced sfr in the ring can persist longer than the hubble time , as long as @xmath73 is located sufficiently far away from the bar ends .",
    "note that ring sfr is not enhanced much in model f10p33 , since @xmath73 is located just outside the bar ends .",

    "column ( 6 ) of table [ tbl : model ] gives @xmath94 for all models .",
    "since the sfr depends on @xmath30 considerably , this suggests that it is not the gas mass in the ring but the mass inflow rate to the ring that controls the ring sfr , even when the effect of spiral arms is included . with the typical ring radius of @xmath95 and thickness of @xmath96 ,",
    "this translates into the averaged gas surface density @xmath97 , which is approximately equal to the critical density @xmath98 for jeans collapse . when @xmath99 , star formation takes place in the ring , reducing the gas density . when @xmath100 , star formation is halted in the ring which has to wait until fresh gas is filled in to resume star formation . for the bar - only models , paper  i found that the ring shrinks in size steadily over time due to the addition of gas with low angular momentum",

    "this is because only the gas located between the bar ends and the cr of the arms can lose angular momentum by passing through spiral arms and move inward to the bar region , while the gas outside the cr of the arms move radially outward .",
    "the gas entering the bar region is first gathered to the bar ends where it loses its angular momentum additionally to move further in along the dust - lane shocks to the nuclear ring .",
    "the inflow to the ring occurs in an intermittent fashion , making the ring star formation episodic that lasts long until the end of the simulations .",
    "ignoring the star formation induced at early time by the bar , the enhanced sfr by spiral arms is @xmath128 , which is about 3 to 20 times larger than that in the no - arm counterpart .",
    "this has an important implication that the sfr histories in nuclear rings can be significantly affected by spiral arms that are slow and strong .",
    "some galaxies are observed to have undergone several episodic bursts of star formation in the rings over a few gyrs @xcite , which appear difficult to be explained by gas inflows driven solely by the bar potential ( paper  i ) .",
    "we suggest that these sustained starburst activities might have resulted from additional gas feeding due to spiral arms .",
    " _ dust lane strength _ : the mass inflows driven by arms also help make the dust lanes stronger . by analyzing sloan digital sky survey dr7 data , @xcite found that about 20% of 266 galaxies with measured bar strength host dust lanes with appreciable strength . on the other hand , numerical simulations with only a bar potential",
    "show that dust lanes remain strong only for @xmath129 around the time when the bar potential achieves its full strength ( e.g , paper  i ; @xcite ) .",
    "given that bars persist for several gyrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , this is not compatible with the results of @xcite .",
    "barred galaxies with strong dust lanes may be either dynamically young or supplied with fresh gas .",
    "our numerical results in this paper suggest that spiral arms with large @xmath73 can be efficient to transport the gas from outside to the bar region .",
    "the typical density of dust lanes in our standard model f10p20 is about @xmath130 .",
    "this corresponds to the extinction magnitude of @xmath131 in the visual band assuming a standard value of @xmath132 for the ratio of total to selective extinction , readily visible against the background stellar light .",
    " _ age gradients of star clusters _ : the gas driven in from the arms to the ring is found to have larger angular momentum than the gas already in the ring .",
    "in addition , feedback from active star formation at late time tends to reduce the rate of angular momentum removal , making the rings in models with spiral arms larger by @xmath1 than those in bar - only models .",
    "consequently , star clusters formed in bar - only models retain an age gradient in the radial direction , while they do not in models with slow - rotating spiral arms . on the other hand ,",
    "the arm - enhanced star formation exhibits an azimuthal age gradient of star clusters such that younger clusters are located closer to the contact points when sfr is small , while clusters with different ages are well mixed when sfr is large .",
    "the critical sfr that determines the absence / presence of the azimuthal age gradient is set by the maximum gas consumption rate @xmath108 at the contact points , which is @xmath133 in our current models , although it may depends sensitively on the gas sound speed and the ring size as @xmath134 ( paper  i ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this appears consistent with the observational data of @xcite in that nuclear rings with an azimuthal age gradient have , on average , a smaller sfr than those without age gradient .",
    "many uncertainties surround the observational determinations of the sfr in nuclear rings and the arm pattern speed .",
    "the derived sfrs from different methods do not always agree .",
    "for the nuclear ring of ngc 6951 , for instance , @xcite derived the current @xmath135 based on the old h@xmath136sfr relation of @xcite , which is known to yield a larger sfr by a factor of @xmath137 than the newly calibrated relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . also , local variations in the stellar - age mix , initial mass function , gas / dust geometry , etc .",
    "are likely to contaminate the derived sfrs to some extent @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite measured the ages and masses of stellar clusters directly to obtain a temporal history of sfr in the ring of the same galaxy .",
    "they found @xmath138 during the past 1 gyr , with the current sfr less than @xmath139 , much smaller than value reported by @xcite . regarding the pattern speeds ,",
    "a model - independent kinematic method proposed by @xcite has been widely used to measure the angular velocities of arms and bars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this method relies critically on a few assumptions , notably that a galactic disk is in a steady state and that there is a well - defined pattern , the validity of which is not always guaranteed .",
    "for instance , star formation and ensuing feedback make the density and velocity fields non - steady in a galactic disk .",
    "when arms are not corotating with a bar , there are significant non - steady motions in the gas flows in the region where the bar joins the arms , which is likely to compromise the derived pattern speeds based on gas tracers .",
    "in addition to pattern speeds , there are many other factors such as the ring size , bar strength , magnetic fields that may affect the ring sfr .",
    "therefore , it is not yet viable to make a definitive comparison of sfrs between our numerical predictions and observations .",
    "nevertheless , the observational data tabulated in table 1 of @xcite show that the averaged ring sfr of sab and sb galaxies are @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "since the relative importance of spiral arms is larger for sab than sb galaxies , these observations are not inconsistent with the idea of arm - enhanced sfr in the nuclear rings .",
    "in addition , the spiral arms of ngc 4314 seem to corotate with the bar @xcite , and the ring sfr in this galaxy is quite low at @xmath142 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "ngc 4321 known to undergo starburst activities in the ring @xcite have spiral arms rotating slower than the bar @xcite .",
    "these are consistent with our result that the arm pattern speed affects the ring sfr .    to explore star formation in nuclear rings",
    ", we have adopted a very simplified model of gas in barred - spiral galaxies .",
    "first of all , we treated the gas as being isothermal and unmagnetized , whereas the interstellar gas in real disk galaxies is multi - phase , magnetized , and turbulent ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this required us to handle star formation feedback in the form of momentum injection rather than thermal energy injection ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we considered an infinitesimally - thin disk , which precludes a potential effect of fluid motions that involve the vertical direction .",
    "most importantly , we here adopted a simple bar potential with fixed strength and pattern speed .",
    "recent @xmath8-body simulations for bar formation show that not only the bar strength but also the bar size and pattern speed vary with time over a few gyrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters of spiral arms also appear to change as a bar evolves ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to study how star formation in nuclear rings studied in this work would change in a more realistic environment where a bar , consisting of live stellar particles , is self - generated and interacts with the gaseous component under radiative cooling and heating , which would be an important direction of future research .",
