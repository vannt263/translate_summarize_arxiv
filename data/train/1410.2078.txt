    "recently , several studies on the static and dynamic properties of dipolar fermi gas have been reported in the literature @xcite . for general review on both dipolar bosons and fermions",
    "we refer the readers to ref .",
    "the characteristic properties of dipolar fermi gas are distinctly different from that of an electron gas or usual fermi gas made of non - dipolar atoms due to the anisotropic and long - range nature of the interaction between the dipoles .",
    "the dipolar fermi gases have been realized experimentally by using various atomic species with large magnetic moment .",
    "for example , isotopes of @xmath0cr , @xmath1yb , and @xmath2dy atoms with large magnetic moment of 6@xmath3 ( @xmath3 denotes bohr magnetron ) , 3@xmath3 , and around 10@xmath3 , respectively have been cooled down to reach quantum degeneracy @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "heteronuclear polar diatomic molecules with large electric dipole moment are promising candidates for realization of dipolar fermi gases .",
    "recently , quantum degeneracy in a sample of around @xmath4 fermionic @xmath5k@xmath6rb molecules in their rovibrational ground state with permanent electric dipole moment of 0.566 debye has been achieved @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the anisotropic characteristic of the dipole - dipole interaction has also been experimentally investigated in these krb samples @xcite .",
    "the successful creation of degenerate dipolar fermi gas of krb molecules has given rise to a new class of many - body system and this has rekindled the interests of theorists to look into these systems . the quantum mechanical description of degenerate fermi gas is more complicated than its bosonic counterpart due to the antisymmetric nature of the many - fermion wave function .",
    "therefore , for theoretical description of many - fermion systems it becomes necessary to invoke some approximations .",
    "we note here that most of theoretical studies on dipolar fermi gases have been carried out either within the semi - classical thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximations @xcite , which neglects effects of both exchange and correlation between the fermions or within the hartee - fock ( hf ) theory @xcite , which takes into account the quantum mechanical effect of exchange of identical particles .",
    "it is only recently liu and yin @xcite reported calculation of correlation energy of homogeneous dipolar fermi gas by going beyond hf approximation .",
    "they estimated the correlation energy , which is defined as the difference between the true ground state energy and the corresponding energy in the hf approximation using perturbative brueckner - goldstone formalism along with monte carlo integration to fix the coefficient .",
    "this study showed that the ground state energy of a homogeneous dipolar fermi gas is reduced when correlation effect is included resulting in significant lowering of critical density required for mechanical collapse as compared to the hf case .",
    "these authors also employed the expression for the correlation energy to calculate the properties of inhomogeneous trapped dipolar fermi gas by using the expressions for exchange and correlation energy functionals within local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we wish to note here that for a system consisting of few ( two to three ) interacting fermions it is possible to construct a fully correlated wave function satisfying antisymmetric property for the calculation of its ground state energy .",
    "for example , in atomic and molecular physics hylleraas - like correlated wave functions @xcite with explicit dependence on the inter - electronic coordinates have yielded very accurate results for two - electron helium - like ions and h@xmath7 molecule @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that beside exchange effect a correlated wave function also takes into account the effect of electron - electron correlation arising from the electron - electron interaction through the dependence of wave function on the inter - electronic coordinate",
    ". however , both hf approach ( which takes into account the effect of exchange ) and semi - classical tf approximation neglect effect of two - particle correlations .",
    "our main objective of this paper is to first calculate ground state energy of a system of two dipolar fermions confined in a harmonic trap by using hylleraas - like correlated wave function . for the purpose of comparison",
    "we also carry out the calculation of ground state energy of a confined two - dipolar fermion system by using hf approach .",
    "albeit , the correlated wave function approach takes into account the effect of both exchange and correlation however , the form of the wave function becomes very cumbersome with increasing number of particles making this approach impractical for systems beyond three particles .",
    "a formalism which takes into account the effects of both exchange and correlation in many - fermion systems efficiently is the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "this formalism circumvents the use of complicated many - body wave function of 3n spatial variables ( where n is number of particles ) , rather works with particle density - a function of just three spatial variables . as a result of this dft based method turns out to be quite suitable for studying fermionic systems with large number of particles . although the theory is exact in principle but the exact forms for exchange and correlation functional in term of density are not known . therefore , to carry out any dft based calculations it becomes necessary to use approximate expressions for the exchange and correlation energies . for electronic systems a tremendous amount of effort has gone into the development of exchange and correlation functionals with increasing degree of accuracy @xcite . the availability of accurate exchange - correlation functional along with significantly lower computational cost of dft - based calculations has made dft an indispensable tool for handling many - electron systems like atoms , molecules , and solids . for electronic systems the simplest and one of the",
    "most extensively used forms for exchange and correlation energy functionals are constructed within lda by replacing the constant electron density in the expressions for exchange and correlation energies of a homogeneous electronic gas by the local density of the inhomogeneous system . as mentioned above it is only recently expressions for the exchange and correlation energies of a homogeneous dipolar fermi gas have been derived @xcite .",
    "the availability of these expressions has motivated us to carry out dft based calculations of the ground state energy of two harmonically trapped dipolar fermi particle within lda and compare these results with the numbers obtained via correlated wave function approach to assess their accuracies .",
    "the remaining paper is organized in the following manner . in section",

    "first of all it can be seen from figure 1 that both hf and dft methods overestimate the ground state energy in comparison to the corresponding wave function based values . among three approaches",
    "the wave function based method yields lowest values for the ground state energy which is consistent with the fact that this method takes into account both effects of exchange and correlation most accurately .",
    "moreover , note that the ground state energy obtained by employing wave function and dft based approaches display similar trend with respect to the variation of interaction strength .",
    "in particular we observe from figure 1 that ground state energies obtained by employing wave function and dft base methods decrease from non - interacting ( @xmath74 ) value of @xmath75 as @xmath73 is increased . on the other hand ,",
    "the ground state energy calculated by hf method remains almost constant at a value of about @xmath76 for the whole range of interaction strength considered in this study .",
    "this behaviour clearly indicates that for dipolar fermions effect of correlation , which is not taken into account in hf method , is quite important and it contributes significantly to the ground state energy of the system .",
    "we note here that although dft based method overestimates the ground state energy as compared to the ones obtained through correlated wave function approach nonetheless it performs better than hf method in predicting the variation of energy with the interaction strength .",
    "this is because , correlation energy is taken into account in dft , albeit in an approximate way .",
    "also it can be noted from figure 1 that for stronger interaction ( @xmath77 ) , the difference between the ground state energies calculated by employing wave function and dft based methods decreases . from this result",
    "we conclude that lda based expressions for the exchange and correlation energies of dipolar fermions @xcite are capable of yielding sufficiently accurate results for the ground state energy of a harmonically confined two dipolar fermions .",
    "therefore , dft based method with exchange and correlation within lda is expected to be suitable for calculations of ground state properties of dipolar fermi gas with large number of particles generally achieved in experiments for which wave function based methods are prohibitive .    .",
    "all numbers are in harmonic oscillator unit . ]    moreover , from figure 1 and the above discussion it is clear that the contribution of correlation energy to the total energy is quite significant and it increases with increase in the interaction strength . keeping this in mind we now assess the accuracy of correlation energy functional proposed by liu and yin @xcite within lda . to this end",
    "we compare the correlation energies as calculated by dft based method with the ones obtained from the explicitly correlated wave function .",
    "the contribution of correlation energy ( @xmath52 ) obtained by these two methods are displayed in figure 2 as a function of the strength of dipolar interaction @xmath73 .",
    "we observe from this figure that these two methods yield same sign ( negative ) for the correlation energy and display similar trend with respect to variation of interaction strength @xmath73 .",

    "the value of @xmath79 is about @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the bohr radius @xcite .",
    "when converted to harmonic oscillator unit with a typical value of oscillator length @xmath82 m , this corresponds to a strength of the dipole interaction @xmath83 . for this value of the interaction strength ,",
    "the ground state energy calculated from correlated wave function comes out to be @xmath84 . on the other hand",
    ", the dft based result within lda for ground state energy at this interaction strength is found to be @xmath85 , which is around 2@xmath86 higher than the corresponding wave function based number .",
    "for the same strength of interaction , the hf based calculation yields @xmath87 . thus the contribution of correlation energy in the total ground state energy obtained by wave function based approach is found to be -0.082 . on the other hand , the value of correlation energy obtained by employing lda based expression eq .",
    "( [ correlation ] ) yields @xmath88 , which is less than one fourth of the magnitude of correlation energy estimated by wave function based approach .",
    "as mentioned before both wave function and dft based approaches take effect of particle - particle correlation into account whereas hf approach completely neglects it .",
    "the difference between the results obtained via wave function and dft based approaches clearly reveals that the effect of particle - particle correlation is underestimated by the lda based expression derived in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the ground state energy of a harmonically confined two interacting dipolar fermions by variational method using a hylleraas - like correlated wave function .",

    "we have also calculated dft based ground state energy of two trapped dipolar fermions .",
