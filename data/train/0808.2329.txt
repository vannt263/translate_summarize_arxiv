    "the path integral monte carlo method ( pimc ) provides a nonperturbative , basis - set - independent , and fully correlated calculation for quantum many - body systems at both zero and finite temperature.@xcite however for many - fermion systems , pimc suffers from uncontrollable errors arising from the notorious _ sign problem_,@xcite which limits the accuracy or stability of the method .",
    "the origin of the _ sign problem _ comes from the fact that the density matrix can be positive or negative by even or odd permutations . at low temperatures , contributions from positive and negative parts of the density matrix almost perfectly cancel each other so that there is no hope of extracting any useful information .",
    "a few methods have been proposed to deal with the _ sign problem_. for problems in the continuous space , there are fixed - node approximation,@xcite released node methods,@xcite exact cancelation methods with green s function sampling,@xcite multilevel blocking algorithm,@xcite a hybrid path integral and basis set method,@xcite various pseudopotential approximations,@xcite the general method for replacing integration over pure states by integration over idempotent density matrices,@xcite and method by introducing several images of the system,@xcite global stationary phase approach.@xcite there are also a number of methods for lattice models.@xcite so far many efforts have been devoted to tackle this problem , however , it remains being the key bottleneck in using pimc for many - fermion systems .    in this paper",
    ", we use a methodology to reduce the rapid oscillation of integrand in the evaluation of high dimensional integrals .",
    "the idea is that , for the region in which the function is rapidly oscillating , the coarse - grained approximations are used to kill fluctuations . applying this technique to pimc",
    ", we found that , the sign fluctuations of density matrix can be reduced , thus the metropolis mc integration algorithm converges efficiently .",
    "more importantly , after carrying out this approximation , the exchange determinant becomes a nonlocal form in imaginary time , thus the collapse behavior can be avoided ( see below ) .",
    "the basic strategy can also be used in the evaluation of other integrals , where the integrands exhibit the rapidly oscillating characters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the methodology is described in sec .",
    "the numerical tests are presented in sec .",
    "discussion and conclusion are given in sec .",
    "to illustrate the coarse - grained approximation used in present paper , we first consider the following integral , @xmath0 we assume that , except for _ f(x , y ) _ is a rapidly oscillating function for variable _ y _ , the rest parts of integrands are well behavior ( or slow varied ) function of _ x _ and _ y_. due to the rapid oscillation of _",

    "1 ) in mc simulation . to overcome the difficulty , our strategy is to make coarse - grained approximations to _ f(x , y)_. to do this , we rewrite the above integral as , @xmath1 with @xmath2 one can see that , _",
    "f(x ) _ is a kind of coarse - grained functions , and the rapid oscillation of _",
    "f(x , y ) _ is smoothed over . _",
    "f(x ) _ also can be viewed as an average of _",
    "f(x , y ) _ weighted by _ g(x , y)h(x , y)_. if _",
    "f(x ) _ can be evaluated either exactly or approximately , the rapid fluctuation due to _ f(x , y ) _ could be reduced effectively . for real problems , _",
    "f(x ) _ usually is hard to be evaluated exactly .",
    "however , it is possible to determine _",
    "f(x ) _ under some reasonable approximations , as we have done in present paper .    considering a three - dimensional system consisting of _ n _ spinless , indistinguishable quantum fermions , the standard pimc is based on the following expansion of partition function :    @xmath3    with @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , _ v _ is the potential energy , and the square _",
    "length_(@xmath8 ) is defined as , @xmath9 .",
    "the subscript _",
    "i _ refers to the particle number while the superscript @xmath10 refers to different slit of imaginary time .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are reciprocal temperature(@xmath14 ) , mass of particles and total number of beads respectively .",
    "@xmath15 refers to @xmath16.to make the expression compact , we have introduced a @xmath17 matrix _ a _ whose element reads @xmath18 _ deta _ is the determinant of the matrix _ a _ , which accounts the contribution of permutations to the partition function .",
    "it is _ deta _ , which can be positive or negative , that causes the so - called _ sign problem_. previous studies based on pseudopotential methods have shown that , direct use of eq.4-like formula usually results in a fermion system _ collapsing _ into a bosonic state at low temperature.@xcite the physical reason comes from the fact that the matrix _ a _ approaching to unit at low temperature . to prevent this undesirable behavior , people usually recast matrix _ a _ in a nonlocal form as suggested by hall,@xcite or directly use a nonlocal pseudopotential as suggested by miura and okazaki.@xcite although these schemes do give a good solution , the computational cost also increases .    from eq . 5",
    ", one can see that , if @xmath19 is close to @xmath20 , @xmath21 will be a rapidly oscillating function of @xmath22 . although , for n@xmath232 , it is difficult to prove the direct relation between the rapid oscillation of @xmath21 and the sign problem , it is quite clear that the rapid oscillation of @xmath21 directly results in the sign fluctuation for n=2 . to smooth the rapid oscillation ,",

    "12 , we have assumed that @xmath40 is weakly dependent of @xmath29 for fixed @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath35 .",
    "this approximation works well if _",
    "m _ is not too small .",
    "the reason lies on the fact that , only the configurations , in which @xmath29 is close to @xmath30 , make the @xmath45 be significant(see below eq .",

    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 are the counterparts of @xmath49 along _ y _ and _ z _ direction respectively .    to calculate @xmath56 , we define a ( m-1)-dimensional vector @xmath57 , of which cartesian components are @xmath58 .",
    "first , for a given @xmath50 , it requires @xmath59=@xmath60 , all the configurations satisfying this condition lie on a surface of ( m-1)-dimensional super - sphere with radius equal to @xmath60 ; second , since the cartesian components of @xmath57 are not independent , _",
    "i.e _ , the project of @xmath57 on the ( m-1)-dimensional unit vector is @xmath61 , this condition defines a ( m-1)-dimensional super - plane ; thus , all the ( m-1)-dimensional points , which attribute to @xmath56 , lie on a ( m-2)-dimensional super - spherical surface intersected by the ( m-1)-dimensional super - sphere and the ( m-1)-dimensional super - plane . according to analytic geometry in high dimensional space",

    "the behaviors of @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the same as that of @xmath71 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath77 also quickly decays as a function of @xmath78 . by employing the change of variables as @xmath79 , and making coordinate transformation in spherical coordinates",
    ", we can see that @xmath73 is a function of @xmath35 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .    after carrying out above coarse - grained approximation",
    ", we find that , the off - diagonal element @xmath73 is a function of both @xmath80 and @xmath35 , which has an explicit nonlocal form .",
    "in contrast , the off - diagonal element @xmath28 is a local function in imaginary time .",
    "more importantly , the off - diagonal element @xmath28 could be much larger or much smaller than 1.0 , while the off - diagonal element @xmath73 is less than 1.0 when @xmath35 is not too long ( see fig .",
    "thus , after replacing @xmath28 with @xmath73 , at least for two - particle system , a lot of sign fluctuations are well canceled .",
    "however , since the length of path could be much longer at low temperature , the off - diagonal element @xmath73 can be larger than 1.0 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , which will result in the presence of negative @xmath82 . to further reduce the negative sign ,",
    "we have made the second stage of coarse - grained approximation for longer paths . using the similar idea as above",
    ", we can replace @xmath26 by a @xmath17 matrix @xmath83 ,    @xmath84    @xmath85 is a function of @xmath80 , which is determined by , @xmath86    the above integral is made over all the configurations with @xmath87 . for an arbitrary interact potential ,",
    "the above integral is almost no hope to be evaluated exactly .",
    "however it can be calculated with approximations ,    @xmath88    in the evaluation of the above coarse - grained approximation , we have assumed that total potential energy is constant when @xmath35 is longer than certain value , _ i.e _ , @xmath85 .",
    "in current work , we have taken @xmath89 through the whole paper .    within the current approximations",
    ", @xmath83 has a few advantages over the original matrix _",
    ", our calculations have shown that the off - diagonal element of @xmath83 is not larger than 1.0 anywhere ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , in constrast the off - diagonal element of _ a _ could be much larger than 1.0 .",
    "thus at least for two - particle system , @xmath83 is always non - negative , the _ sign problem _ completely vanishes .",
    "second , different from _ a _ , @xmath83 is nonlocal , which depends on the whole path . the nonlocal behavior of @xmath83 can effectively avoid the _ collapse _ of fermion system into boson system at low temperature . at low temperature",
    ", the length of path becomes longer and longer , so the off - diagonal element of @xmath83 has more chance being 1.0 .",
    "this situation makes @xmath83 have little chance being unit matrix .",
    "our calculation also demonstrates this point .",
    "it should be pointed out that the current formula is exact for free particles ( see appendix ) .",
    "now we end up with the final formula for real calculations , @xmath90 \\label{eq : partation2}\\ ] ] in real calculation , the element of @xmath83 is first numerically integrated . at the same time , the derivative of @xmath83 respective to temperature is also numerically calculated to account the contribution to thermal energy .",
    "18 can not be directly used in standard mc , since for the fermionic systems , @xmath91 is not always positive .",
    "however eq .",
    "18 can be integrated using modified mc technique , which is widely used previously.@xcite to achieve this result , we first defined pseudo - hamiltonian , @xmath92 , which is , @xmath93 the thermodynamic average of a physical quantity q is @xmath94 where @xmath95 stands for the sign of @xmath91 at a configuration .",
    "it needs to be pointed out that , we have used the similar technique as most pseudopotential methods,@xcite but we do not recast matrix @xmath83 or extend @xmath83 into each imaginary time .",
    "to illustrate the usefulness of the current method , we have considered _",
    "n _ interacting spinless fermions confined in a three - dimensional harmonic well , which hamiltonian reads , @xmath96 where _ m _ , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are mass , positions , momenta of the particles , and the inter - particle interaction potential , respectively . for computational simplicity , the units by which @xmath100 are used through the rest of this paper . in current calculations ,",
    "we consider three cases , _ i.e _ ,",
    "case 1 : @xmath101 , n=6 and @xmath102 , no interaction between particles , reflecting a standard harmonic system ; case 2 : n=6 , @xmath103 , where the interaction is also harmonic one with @xmath104 and @xmath105 ; case 3 : @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and n=2 , interaction between particles is the coulomb potential , the parameters correspond to hydrogen - like ion ( @xmath109 ) of kestner - sinanoglu model.@xcite the exact results of all three cases can be found elsewhere,@xcite which is easy to check the validity of the current method .",
    "these models are widely used as a benchmark for checking the usefulness of various methods for _ sign problem _ , see for examples ref.@xcite    our metropolis mc scheme is preformed based on eq .",
    "19 . at each step",
    ", @xmath92 are calculated to determine the rejection and acceptance .",
    "@xmath91 is calculated by a certain algorithm with the computational cost scaled by @xmath110.@xcite this kind of numerical technique enables us to perform the fermionic simulations with reasonable computational time .",
    "there are two basic types of moves in current simulations : ( 1 ) displacement move , where all the coordinates for a single particle are displaced uniformly ; ( 2 ) standard bisection moves.@xcite the mc procedure used in this work is wildly used by others .",
    "one mc step is defined as one application of each procedure .",
    "ten million mc steps of calculation were carried out for each temperature .",
    "for a few cases , 100 million mc steps are made to check the ergodic problem .",
    "the results agree with the short runs within the error bars . to further check the ergodic problem ,",
    "the simulations are carried out by a few random generated starting configurations .",
    "all simulations converge to the same results .",
    "the energy is calculated based on the thermodynamic estimator.@xcite the energies are well converged at m/@xmath11=20 , 22 and 5 for case 1 , 2 and 3 respectively .    the calculated thermal energy is in good agreement with the exact one for all three cases studied . in case 3 , the exact energy 2.647 of ref .",
    "@xcite has been almost accurately reproduced , which is 2.652@xmath1110.003 in current simulations .",
    "2 shows the thermal energy per particle as a function of temperature for case 1 and 2 , the corresponding exact results are also shown in fig .",
    "2 with lines .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the overall temperature dependence is well reproduced by current calculations .",
    "the calculated thermal energies agree very well with the exact value at low temperature .",
    "the slight deviation at high temperature is due to the fact that the first stage of approximation will result in error when the number of beads is too small , which is the case for high temperature .",
    "we have calculated the pair correlation function ( pcf ) between beads , which is defined as , @xmath112 it is known that,@xcite comparing with boson and boltzmann systems , the fermionic pcf has a hole around the origin , which reflects the pauli exclusion principle . in fig .",
    "3 , we present pcf for case 1 and 2 at temperature of 0.2 . from this figure",
    ", we can see that , the pair correlation function clearly represents the effect due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the similar behaviors are observed for other temperature and systems .",
    "the average sign reflects the signal - to - noise ratio , which directly affects calculation precision and computation time needed .",
    "the average sign is defined as @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the total positive and negative configuration respectively .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "4 shows the average sign of current simulations via temperature .",
    "it can be seen that , @xmath116 decreases with the decrease of the temperature .",
    "however , for the studied systems , even at lowest temperature ( t=0.1 ) , the average sign is quite high ( around 0.1 ) .",
    "we also calculated the average sign via the number of particles at t=0.5 for both case 1 and 2 , which is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "4 . similarly",
    ", @xmath116 also decreases with the increase of the number of particles .",
    "although we have not completely solved the _ sign problem _ , our approach does much improve the sign decay rate with both temperature and number of particles .",
    "direct using of eq . 4",
    ", @xmath116 is about 0.01 at temperature of 0.8 for case 1 . and for temperature lower than 0.8 , the large sign fluctuation makes mc simulation difficult to obtain any useful information . according to the data shown in fig .",
    "4 , the maximum number of particles , which can be handled in current method , should be in order of ten .",
    "considering both spin - up and -down , the maximum number of particles can be around twenty , which could be particularly useful for atom and molecular systems .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced an approach to reduce the fermion sign fluctuation in finite temperature pimc simulations . by this method ,",
    "configurations , which probably cause the sign fluctuation , are pre - calculated within two stages of coarse - grained approximations , while the rest are treated exactly .",
    "after two stages of coarse - grained approximations , at least for two - particle system , the _ sign problem _ is solved completely .",
    "since the exchange matrix @xmath117 is replaced by a non - local one ( @xmath83 ) , the collapse of fermion system into a boson one at low temperature has been effectively avoided .",
    "the pilot calculation was performed on three model systems : six independent particles in a three - dimensional harmonic well , six interacting particles in a three - dimensional harmonic well , and hydrogen - like ion ( @xmath109 ) of kestner - sinanoglu model .",
    "the calculation shows that the current approach not only dramatically drops the sign fluctuation , but also gives an excellent description to real systems",
    ". our method could be particularly useful for atom and molecular systems .",
    "although our approach suffers from the _ sign problem _ for large number of particles , we believe that it provide an alternative thought on the sign problem .",
    "we also believe that a similar approach can also be helpful in other path integral methods .",
    "the current formula can be easily extended to systems consisting of both spin - up and -down fermions.(see for example , @xcite )    our approximation breaks down for systems including particles more than twenty ( including both spin up and down particles ) .",
    "it would be possible to generalize our method for problems of larger numbers of fermions .",
    "although we have used @xmath118 through out this paper , other values are also possible .",
    "for example , if @xmath119 ) is chosen , the current method can be more flexible . for @xmath120 ,",
    "it is the case used in current work . for @xmath121",
    ", @xmath91 becomes the exact density matrix of free particles(see appendix ) , thus the sign problem can be avoided completely .",
    "in fact , with @xmath122 increasing from 0 to 1 , the approximation becomes more and more crude , but the negative parts become less and less . to further improve the current method , a better form or value for @xmath123 could be found .",
