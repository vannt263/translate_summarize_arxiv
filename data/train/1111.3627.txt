    "the harvesting of sunlight by organisms such as plants and bacteria plays a crucial role in life on earth .",
    "nature has optimized the photosynthesis process to a great extent , leading to a high efficiency in both the capturing of light and the subsequent energy transport within the organism s light harvesting complexes .",
    "@xcite pigment molecules in these light harvesting structures absorb the light , after which the excitation energy is eventually funneled towards the reaction center , where charge separation takes place and the energy can be utilized for biochemical purposes .",
    "a closer understanding of the functioning of these biological systems and what features are crucial to their high efficiency may provide further insight in how to optimize synthetic light harvesting structures .",
    "recent experimental studies have shown that quantum coherence in light harvesting complexes persists on surprisingly long timescales .",
    "@xcite while excitation energy transport ( eet ) in such molecular systems has been a subject of study for decades ,  @xcite the aforementioned experimental observation of long - lived coherence despite its occurrence in noisy environments at room temperature has spurred further theoretical research .",
    "naively , one might think that coupling the electronic excitations to a dissipative environment will lead to rapid decoherence and a loss of excitation energy .",
    "however , it has been shown that environment - induced dephasing and noise may actually enhance the transport efficiency of excitations in such structures .",
    "@xcite the rationale behind this lies in the fact that interaction with degrees of freedom in the bath can induce transitions of the excitation that are directed towards the reaction center .",
    "recent studies have shed further light on the mechanisms that allow for optimal efficiency of the excitation , suggesting an intricate functioning where aspects such as the non - markovian nature of the bath interactions  @xcite and correlations in the bath  @xcite may be exploited to achieve further optimization of the light harvesting complex .",
    "the interaction of the chromophores with their local environments leads to fluctuations of the transition energies and interactions .",
    "more specifically , changes in the environment will induce fluctuating local electrical fields .",
    "the resultant stark shifts in the transition energies and transition dipoles of the chromophores will thus also fluctuate ; in addition , environment - induced changes in relative position or orientation of the chromophores will also cause corresponding fluctuations in the interactions .",
    "@xcite a number of studies have been performed where only the effect of transition energy fluctuations has been included , as well as possible spatial and temporal correlations between these transition energy fluctuations .",
    "@xcite this is commonly done in the framework of the extended haken - strobl - reineker model ,  @xcite which provides an attractive approach due to its simplicity and tractability .",
    "the original haken - strobl - reineker model allows for a treatment of both transition energy and interaction fluctuations , and while it does not include correlations and inherently assumes a high temperature , the formalism can straightforwardly be generalized to remove the former drawback .",
    "fluctuations in the interactions , in contrast to transition energy fluctuations , have typically not been accounted for in studies of photosynthetic complexes , despite the fact that these will generally occur as well .",
    "fluctuations in transition energies and interactions are induced by variations in the local environments of the chromophores , and environmental variations around one chromophore will generate both fluctuations in its transition energy and in its interaction with the other chromophores .",
    "in addition , different chromophores may share part of the environment ; both these arguments imply that the generated fluctuations will in general be correlated . while correlations between transition energy fluctuations have been studied ,  @xcite there should generally also be correlations of transition energy fluctuations and interaction fluctuations , and between different interaction fluctuations . in previous studies ,",
    "such correlations have commonly been discarded , even though there is no a priori reason to do so .",
    "a number of recent studies have also suggested the occurrence of such fluctuations in photosynthetic complexes .",
    "@xcite moreover , fluctuations of the various intermolecular interactions are usually not accounted for , although also these are typically induced by changes in the local environment .",
    "we present a study of the effects of fluctuations of the interactions and their possible correlations with the various transition energy and other interaction fluctuations , and provide a numerical analysis of their measurable effects . when applied to natural photosynthetic complexes , such as the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex ,  @xcite it is shown that interaction fluctuations can have a considerable impact on the excitation dynamics and the efficiency , and these effects",
    "should generally not be neglected .",
    "furthermore , we show that additional correlations can lead to enhanced oscillations of the exciton populations and modifications of the transfer and dephasing rates , and we quantify the dependence of the trapping efficiency on the correlations and initial conditions .",

    "this leaves us with the reduced density matrix @xmath17 in the interaction picture , which is the quantity we will consider from this point on when referring to the density matrix .",
    "the approach we take in treating interactions with the environment is based on a method first introduced by haken , strobl and reineker.@xcite in this approach , one models the bath - induced fluctuations as classical gaussian markov processes . while the original haken - strobl - reineker ( hsr ) model assumed uncorrelated site energy fluctuations",

    "all other elements of @xmath27 correspond to correlations between different fluctuations .",
    "secondly , the correlation matrix fulfills a number of symmetries , due to the requirement of a hermitian hamiltonian and a set of trivial index permutation invariances , @xmath31 we observe that there are generally three types of correlations , namely between fluctuations in    * excitation energies ( @xmath32 ) , * excitation energies and interactions ( @xmath33 or vice versa ) , * interactions ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "a number of studies have included the first type of correlation , i.e. spatially correlated transition energy fluctuations , which have been shown to lead to appreciable changes in the transfer rates and efficiency of light - harvesting systems .",
    "@xcite however , the second type of correlation has only been studied in the dimer ,  @xcite while the third type of correlation has to the best of our knowledge not been included at all in studies of eet in photosynthetic complexes .",
    "the central concern of this study is to provide an understanding of the relevance of such correlations to the time evolution of the various density matrix elements and the overall quantum efficiency .",
    "besides the above symmetry considerations , additional restrictions apply to the various correlations in order to describe a physical system .",
    "@xcite this becomes clear when one considers the expectation value of the difference between two fluctuation elements squared , which should obviously give a positive result , @xmath35 by considering such inequalities for various values of the indices , one finds a number of consistency conditions that need to be fulfilled , @xmath36 where the indices @xmath2,@xmath4 and @xmath37 are allowed to be equal .",

    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath38 where the equality holds when the fluctuations of the hamiltonian matrix elements @xmath39 and @xmath40 are fully ( anti-)correlated .",
    "these limitations on the allowed fluctuation correlations should be kept in mind when considering the effect of including the various additional correlations .",
    "the model light harvesting system for which we want to quantitatively probe the effects of correlations in the environmentally induced fluctuations is the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex .",

    "@xcite    we model a subunit of the fmo complex by the following experimental hamiltonian in the site basis ( in units of @xmath41),@xcite    @xmath42    the corresponding exciton states , which we label in order of increasing energy , are given in appendix [ appendixa ] .",

    "as stated before , the fmo complex consists of seven coupled bchl s . in the following sections",
    ", we will first discuss the effects of uncorrelated interaction fluctuations , and subsequently proceed with a study of the effect of correlations between the various possible fluctuations .",
    "since many of the interactions are already small to begin with , we only consider fluctuations in the strongest interactions . likewise ,",
    "we only consider correlations involving the strongest interactions , i.e. interactions between bchl s of a magnitude exceeding @xmath56 @xmath41 , which are shown in fig . [ fig : fmoschema ] . in addition",
    ", we only include correlations between site energy fluctuations of site @xmath2 and interactions involving that same site , and similarly , correlations between interaction fluctuations that have one site in common .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that correlations between fluctuations are predominantly caused by shared local environments .",
    "the numerical calculations reported in the upcoming sections concern energy flowing into the fmo complex at bchl 1 . as we label the exciton states @xmath57 in order of increasing energy , this corresponds to initially exciting exciton states @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "one of our goals is to investigate the effect of including energy - interaction fluctuation correlations on the experimentally observed oscillations of the exciton populations.@xcite therefore , we choose an initial excitation where exciton coherence is already initially present , @xmath58 .",
    "obviously , different values of the mixing angle @xmath59 correspond to different initial populations @xmath60 of bchl s 1 and 2 .",
    "in particular , @xmath61 implies @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 yields @xmath65 , and for @xmath66 we have @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "this corresponds ( mostly ) to initially exciting exciton states @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the results do not change qualitatively , except for a considerable decrease in population oscillation frequency due to the smaller energy difference between exciton states @xmath69 and @xmath70 as compared to exciton states @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for future reference , the exciton that most strongly overlaps with the trap state bchl 3 is exciton state @xmath47 .",
    "the parameters considered in our simulations have previously been used in ref . to model the fmo system .",
    "we take all exciton decay rates equal at a value @xmath71 ns@xmath72 , while only trapping from bchl 3 occurs , with a trapping rate @xmath73 ps@xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , we take @xmath74 @xmath41 for the transition energy fluctuations ; note that there is a factor of 2 difference in the definition of @xmath28 as compared to the quantity @xmath75 in ref . .",
    "the effect of interaction fluctuations can be investigated straightforwardly with the current formalism , by introducing nonzero values for the fluctuations of the off - diagonal hamiltonian matrix elements , @xmath76 . as stated in the previous section , only fluctuations of the strongest interactions , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmoschema ] , are included .",
    "note that , since @xmath29 is the expectation value of a squared quantity , it is necessarily positive . in the original works by haken ,",
    "strobl and reineker,@xcite interaction fluctuations were already considered , and also a recent paper by chen and silbey  @xcite showed that interaction fluctuations can have a pronounced effect on exciton dynamics in the dimer .",
    "this makes it all the more surprising that this effect is commonly neglected in recent studies concerning the fmo complex .",
    "the time evolution of the population of exciton state @xmath43 and the ( real part of the ) coherence between exciton states @xmath43 and @xmath44 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma1 ] , clearly showing that their time evolution strongly depends on the presence of interaction fluctuations .",

    "analysis of the temporal evolution of the exciton populations and coherences , in particular the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma1 ] and estimating the rates by assuming simple exponential decay and looking at times where the oscillations have died out , reveals that the population transfer rate and decoherence rate both increase approximately linearly with the interaction fluctuations @xmath80 .",
    "this is to be expected from the general form of the time evolution equations , eq .",
    "[ timeevolution ] .",
    "while these full equations contain a very large amount of terms , all couplings between the density matrix elements are proportional to either @xmath81 or @xmath80 .",
    "the population transfer rate , in particular , contains only a small contribution from @xmath81 terms for these parameters , and therefore the population transfer is increased dramatically upon introduction of interaction fluctuations .",
    "note that this behavior is consistent with previous results for the dimer ,  @xcite where the exciton population transfer rate for a strongly detuned dimer is to a very large extent dominated by the interaction fluctuations .",
    "this is analogous to the situation in the fmo complex , where the differences between the bchl transition energies are also typically large compared to the interactions .",
    "more specifically , for a dimer detuned by an energy difference @xmath82 and having an interaction strength @xmath83 , the mixing angle @xmath84 defined by @xmath85 is small .",
    "it can analytically be shown  @xcite that the population transfer rate @xmath75 between the two exciton states is given by @xmath86 . however , since the first term is typically very small for strongly detuned dimers ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) , the population transfer rate is fully dominated by the second term as soon as interaction fluctuations are present .",
    "an analysis of the population evolution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma1 ] confirms that the population transfer rates in fmo are indeed also proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "thus , interaction fluctuations lead to dramatic increases in population transfer rates , in turn enhancing the efficiency of the fmo complex .    to further illustrate the increase in population transfer rates with increasing interaction fluctuations , fig . [",
    "fig : gamma1-efficiency ] shows the harvesting time as a function of the interaction fluctuation amplitude @xmath80 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma1-efficiency ] , we consider the energy fluctuation magnitude @xmath81 that optimizes the harvesting time , @xmath78 @xmath41 , and an increase respectively decrease of one order of magnitude .",
    "note that increasing @xmath80 leads to more efficient light harvesting due to a corresponding increase in population transfer within the fmo complex ; this holds for different values of the energy fluctuations @xmath81 and for different initial conditions .",
    "additionally , while the optimal dephasing value @xmath81 does not change with @xmath80 , the optimum becomes considerably less deep , making the fmo complex more robust to variations in the dephasing rate @xmath81 .",
    "for very large , in fact unphysically large , interaction fluctuations , the efficiency of the light harvesting complex becomes independent of the energy fluctuation magnitude .",
    "this situation corresponds to large population transfer rates , dominated by the interaction fluctuations @xmath80 , and subsequent rapid redistribution of population over all bchl s .",
    "the harvesting time will in that case converge to @xmath88 ps , corresponding to a trapping rate @xmath89 ps@xmath72 from bchl 3 where at all times 1/7th of the total untrapped population will reside .",
    ", for various values of the energy fluctuations @xmath81 . notice the decrease in harvesting time with @xmath80 as a result of increasing population transfer rates .",
    "]        here , we consider @xmath74 @xmath41 which corresponds to parameters close to the optimal energy transport conditions reported in ref . .",
    "the magnitude of the allowed correlations is limited by eqs .",
    "[ consistency ] ; to allow for appreciable amounts of correlation , we take a large interaction fluctuation value @xmath90 @xmath41 ( @xmath91 ) , with the same provisions as before . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : ps2 ] , we discuss the effect of correlated energy and interaction fluctuations for a smaller , more realistic value of the interaction fluctuation magnitude @xmath80 . as stated in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , we only include correlations that involve the strongest interactions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fmoschema ] ) and we focus on correlations between interaction fluctuations and energy fluctuations of the bchl s involved in that particular interaction ; @xmath92 , @xmath91",
    ".    first of all , taking all energy - interaction fluctuation correlations equal in sign and magnitude leads to negligible effects .",
    "this is consistent with a previous study by chen and silbey , where it was shown that in a dimer the relevant quantity is the difference between the two transition energy - interaction fluctuation correlations.@xcite while the full time evolution equations for the more complicated fmo system are more involved , a similar result is observed to hold .",
    "this is not surprising , as fluctuation correlations of equal sign would imply that a change of interaction would mean that both energies involved change in the same direction , leaving the energy difference unchanged .",
    "therefore , we choose the various energy - interaction correlations of equal magnitude , but with alternating sign ; that is , we take @xmath93 and so on .",
    "there is an ambiguity near bchl 4 , as it strongly interacts with three other bchl s and it is therefore necessary to choose two out of @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 with equal sign .",
    "we take @xmath97 ; other choices result only in inconsequential numerical changes .",
    "a few observations can be made regarding these plots .",
    "first of all , energy - interaction fluctuation correlations affect both the energy transfer rates and the coherence decay rates .",
    "depending on the sign of the correlations , both increases and decreases of the various rates can occur .",
    "this can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:33ej ] , where the population of exciton state @xmath43 shows appreciable differences in transfer rate to other exciton states for different correlation magnitudes .",
    "while this particular exciton state and initial condition shows an increase in the transfer rate upon increasing correlations , this is not general ; a decrease in transfer rate may be obtained for different exciton states and initial conditions . secondly",
    ", it is clear that these parameters lead to a quick redistribution of population over all chromophores , only showing oscillatory features on a short time scale .",
    "therefore , in the next subsection , we consider the same quantities for different parameters , where the effect on population oscillations can be observed more clearly .    , @xmath61 , with @xmath78 @xmath41 and @xmath98 @xmath41 .",

    "it is also possible to investigate the dependence of the harvesting efficiency , here quantified through the average trapping time @xmath100 , on the magnitude of the energy - interaction fluctuation correlation @xmath101 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff1 ] ; the effects are rather limited , with changes of at most a few percent . both the overall effect of accounting for these correlations and the dependence on the initial condition , defined by the mixing angle @xmath59 , is rather weak .",
    "this is related to the fact that we are close to the conditions that constitute optimal harvesting behavior ( i.e. , @xmath78 @xmath41 ) , which is corroborated by the harvesting times which are only slightly above @xmath88 ps . in other words ,",
    "the bottleneck in the overall harvesting process is not population transfer between the bchl s , but the trapping of excitations from bchl 3 into the reaction center .",
    "therefore , the effect of limited changes in the population transfer rates have relatively little effect on the overall efficiency .",
    "note that negative values of @xmath101 may give a small enhancement of the harvesting time ; depending on the initial conditions , a nonzero optimal choice for the correlations may be made such that light harvesting is at its fastest .",

    "a clear augmentation of the amplitude of the oscillations can be observed when one increases the magnitude of @xmath101 .",
    "the introduction of energy - interaction fluctuation correlations can thus enhance the population oscillations , which are driven by the presence of coherence .",
    "as before , we also observe a change in population transfer rates , with in particular a strong suppression of population transfer with increasing @xmath101 .",
    "the dependence of the harvesting efficiency on the correlation magnitudes can be calculated exactly as before , and is shown in fig .",

    "in addition , while there is a small change in the size of the populations , the amplitude of the oscillations is influenced by the interaction - interaction fluctuation correlation magnitude to only a small extent . these conclusions",
    "are observed to hold for different sets of parameters and initial conditions .",
    "[ fig : qc ] shows the dependence of the harvesting time on the magnitude of the interaction - interaction fluctuation correlations .",
    "again , there is an optimum for some nonzero value of the correlation magnitude @xmath114 ; the exact value of the optimal magnitude for the correlations depends on the initial conditions and on the choice for the energy - interaction correlations .",
    "the behavior for other values of the initial phase factor @xmath59 is very similar , implying that the transfer rates and other relevant parameters for trapping will only depend weakly on possible interaction - interaction fluctuation correlations . while fig .",
    "[ fig : qc ] shows that the effect of interaction - interaction fluctuation correlations is roughly of the same magnitude as the effect of transition energy - interaction fluctuation correlations , this is only the case if the former occurs in conjunction with the latter .",
    "the changes induced by interaction - interaction fluctuation correlations for the case of @xmath115 @xmath41 are considerably smaller . finally , as was previously the case in sec .",
    "[ sec : ejfluc ] , a more suboptimal choice of parameters leads to a larger effect of changes in transfer rates , and will thus also amplify the effect of including interaction - interaction fluctuation correlations to an extent .",
    "since in principle environmental changes will induce fluctuations of both transition energies and interactions that should be correlated to some extent , we have performed a study of the effect of such fluctuations and their possible correlations on the energy transfer and excitation dynamics in photosynthetic complexes , specifically focusing on the fenna - matthews - olson complex as a model system .",
    "the inclusion of interaction fluctuations and correlations between transition energy fluctuations and interaction fluctuations , and between different interaction fluctuations , has been studied by a straightforward generalization of the haken - strobl - reineker model .",
    "these additional correlations have been shown to be naturally limited in magnitude , in order to correspond to a physically consistent system .",
    "interaction fluctuations on the excitation dynamics in photosynthetic complexes can in general not be neglected . not only",
    "will these in general occur , but it has been shown that even small values of interaction fluctuations can already lead to an appreciable increase in transfer rates and a corresponding increase in efficiency of the fmo complex . in particular , for suboptimal values of the energy fluctuations , interaction fluctuations can lead to a considerable optimization of the light harvesting process , even to such an extent that the transfer rates and the eventual efficiency is dominated by interaction fluctuations and not by energy fluctuations . the presence of interaction fluctuations may thus make the efficiency of the fmo complex more robust to changes in the dephasing rate . generally , for various initial conditions and energy fluctuation magnitudes , an increase in the efficiency of the fmo complex is observed with increasing interaction fluctuation amplitude .    when including correlated transition energy fluctuations and interaction fluctuations , it is first of all possible to observe somewhat enhanced population oscillations , driven by the coherence between the initially excited exciton states .",
    "depending on the signs of the various correlations , a suppression of the oscillations can also occur .",
    "in addition , one sees that the transfer rates between exciton states is modified , which in turn leads to accompanying changes in the overall efficiency of the photosynthetic complex .",
    "the overall effects on the efficiency are limited in scope when one considers parameter values that approximately correspond to an optimal functioning of the light harvesting complex . in that case ,",
    "not the excitation transfer but the trapping into the reaction center is the bottleneck , so that changes in transfer rates will only change the harvesting time by up to a few percent . for less optimal conditions ,",
    "the effects can be considerably larger , as the excitation transfer processes play a larger role in determining the overall harvesting time .",
    "typically , a small increase in the light harvesting efficiency can be obtained by using a nonzero amount of correlation between the aforementioned fluctuations . by the same approach",
    ", one can quantify how correlations between the various interaction fluctuations modify previously obtained results .",
    "the effect of these additional correlations turns out to be qualitatively very similar to that of transition energy - interaction fluctuation correlations , and are quantitatively of a comparable magnitude .",
    "the net effect of such correlations is limited to small changes in the scattering rate and resultant changes in the overall efficiency .",
    "this study thus suggests that one should not neglect interaction fluctuations in models describing the energy transfer in photosynthetic complexes .",
    "correlations may also play a relevant role in the excitation dynamics , and this may ( but does not necessarily ) translate into appreciable changes in the efficiency .",
