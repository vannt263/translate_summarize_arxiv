    "the 1994 data are first investigated in the framework of a regge phenomenological model @xcite .",
    "the 1994 data are subjected to a fit in which a single factorisable trajectory ( @xmath1 ) is exchanged such that : @xmath2 in this parameterization , @xmath3 can be interpreted as the structure function of the pomeron @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is treated as a free parameter at each point in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the pomeron flux takes a regge form with a linear trajectory @xmath6 , such that @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the minimum kinematically allowed value of @xmath9 and @xmath10 gev@xmath11 is the limit of the measurement .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is a free parameter and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are taken from hadron - hadron data @xcite .",
    "the fit with a single trajectory does not give a good description of the data in the same way as it is observed at @xmath15 @xcite that secondary trajectories in addition to the pomeron are required to describe diffractive @xmath16 data .",
    "a much better fit is obtained when both a leading ( @xmath1 ) and a sub - leading ( @xmath17 ) trajectory are considered in the same way as in formula ( [ ff1 ] ) , where the values of @xmath3 and @xmath18 are treated as free parameters at each point in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath12 and @xmath19 being two free parameters .",
    "the flux factor for the secondary trajectory takes the same form as equation  ( [ flux ] ) , with @xmath20 , and @xmath21 again taken from hadron - hadron data @xcite .",
    "this fit yields to the following value of @xmath22 @xcite and is significantly larger than values extracted from soft hadronic data ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the quality of the fit is similar if interference between the two trajectories is introduced .",
    "it has been suggested that the @xmath5 evolution of the pomeron structure function may be understood in terms of parton dynamics from perturbative qcd where parton densities are evolved according to dglap @xcite equations @xcite , using the grv parametrization for @xmath24  @xcite .    for the pomeron",

    "some details about the fits can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "a sum of @xmath37 orthonormal polynomials is used so that the input distributions are free to adopt a large range of forms for a given number of parameters .",
    "the exponential factor is needed to ensure a correct convergence close to @xmath38=1 .",
    "the trajectory intercepts are fixed to @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "only data points of h1 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 gev and @xmath43 are included in the fit in order to avoid large higher twist effects and the region that may be most strongly affected by a non zero value of @xmath44 , the longitudinal to transverse cross - section ratio .",
    "the resulting parton densities of the pomeron are presented in figure  [ f1 ] . as it was noticed in the 1994 @xmath45 paper @xcite",
    ", we find two possible fits quoted here as fit 1 and fit 2 .",
    "each fit shows a large gluonic content .",
    "the quark contribution is quite similar for both fits , but the gluon distribution tends to be quite different at high values of @xmath38 .",
    "this can be easily explained as no data above @xmath46 are included in the fits .",
    "thus there is no constraint from the data at high @xmath38 .",
    "the quark densities is on the contrary more constrained in this region with the dglap evolution .",
    "both fits show similar @xmath47 ( the @xmath47 per degree of freedom is about 1.2 ) . by degree of freedom",
    "is 1.3 compared to 1.2 for fit 1 ) and is quite instable : changing a little the parameters modifies the gluon distribution at high @xmath38 . ] adding the 1995 data points into the fits also allows to get a better constraint on initial parton densities at @xmath48 gev@xmath11 compared to the fits performed with 1994 data points alone . for the gluon density presented in figure  [ f1 ]",
    ", we have determined that @xmath49 for @xmath38 below 0.6 .",
    "the result of the fit is presented in figure  [ f2 ] together with the experimental values for 1994 data points  ; we see on this figure the good agreement of the qcd prediction and the data points , which supports the validity of description of the pomeron in terms of partons following a qcd dynamics .",
    "we have also tried to extend the qcd fits to lower @xmath5 ( below @xmath50 gev@xmath11 ) using the 1995 @xmath45 measurement .",
    "the @xmath47 of the fit turns out to increase ( @xmath51 , adding 35 low @xmath5 points to the 171 points ) @xcite .",
    "this can be illustrated in figure 2 of reference @xcite where changes of slopes of scaling violations for @xmath5 below and above @xmath50 gev@xmath11 can be seen .",
    "it may indicate that breaking of perturbative qcd has already occured in this region .",
    "the idea would then to use these parton distributions and to compare with the measurements at tevatron in order to study factorisation breaking .",
    "the roman pots which will be available in the d0 experiment at run ii will allow a direct comparison with the results obtained from the hera parton distributions .",
    "it will be possible to know where factorisation breaking takes place at tevatron , e.g. is it at low or high @xmath4 ?",
