    "ebola virus disease ( evd ) is a severe disease in humans which has infected nearly 25 thousand individuals and claimed more than ten thousand deaths during the recent outbreak in west africa , according to the report of world health organization dated 18 march 2015 @xcite .",
    "the most affected countries are guinea , liberia and sierra leone .",
    "this study aims to provide some real - time estimations on the outbreak in these three countries using the reported cumulative case data .",
    "specifically , we will estimate the following quantities :    1 .",
    "basic reproduction number @xmath0 , which is defined as the average new cases caused by a single infective individual during one infectious period ; 2 .",
    "inflection point @xmath1 , which marks the time when the increment speed of cumulative case numbers starts to slow down ; 3 .",
    "final outbreak size @xmath2 , which indicates the total number of infectious cases throughout the outbreak wave .",
    "peak time @xmath3 , which is defined as the critical time when daily infectious number reaches its maximum .",
    "all of these indicators provide quantitative information about severity of a disease outbreak .",
    "following @xcite , we study the epidemic model : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the numbers of susceptible and infective individuals at time @xmath7 , respectively . the constant @xmath8 denotes the transmission rate of the disease , and the constant @xmath9 corresponds to the removal rate of infective individuals . the basic reproduction number @xcite is given by @xmath10 it is noted that a disease outbreak occurs if and",
    "only if @xmath11 . the differential system can be solved explicitly and its solution is given by @xmath12^{-r_0/(r_0 - 1)};\\\\      i(t)=&k[1+e^{\\gamma(r_0 - 1)(t - t_c)}]^{-1/(r_0 - 1 ) }      \\\\&-k[1+e^{\\gamma(r_0 - 1)(t - t_c)}]^{-r_0/(r_0 - 1 ) } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath1 are two constants of integration .",
    "now , we define the cumulative infective case number at time @xmath7 as @xmath13 from and , we have @xmath14^{-r_0/(r_0 - 1)}.\\ ] ] here , the constant @xmath15 has the biological meaning of final outbreak size .",
    "it can be verified that @xmath16 .",
    "hence , @xmath1 is the inflection point of @xmath17 .",
    "we remark that the inflection point @xmath1 is related to but different from another commonly used quantity : the peak time , denoted by @xmath3 . the peak time is defined as the time when infective case number achieves its maximum , namely , @xmath18 .",
    "it follows from that @xmath19 in the case when @xmath0 is close to @xmath20 , namely , @xmath21 , we can approximate the difference @xmath22 by @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the peak time occurs about one infectious period after the inflection point @xcite .",
    "richards empirical model @xcite was suggested to provide real - time estimation of a disease outbreak ; see @xcite for example .",
    "however , some of the parameters in richards model do not have clear biological meanings @xcite .",
    "the advantage of formula is that all of the parameters in this formula have significant biological interpretations .",
    "we will use the explicit formula of @xmath17 in to fit the reported cumulative case numbers of 2014 ebola outbreak in west africa and provide real - time estimation of basic reproduction number @xmath0 , inflection point @xmath1 , final outbreak size @xmath2 and peak time @xmath3 .    as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "one should fix the value of @xmath9 , the removal rate of infective individuals , to resolve possible overfitting problems . note that @xmath23 can be regarded as the infectious period which characterizes the average duration of an individual being infective . in most cases ,",
    "an individual is removed from the infective group either by recovery or death . for the fatal cases of ebola virus disease",
    ", death usually occurs between 6 and 16 days ( with mean 7.5 days ) after onset of symptom ; and for the non - fatal cases , patients may improve their symptoms at around day 6 but need more time to recover @xcite .",
    "convalescent patients may still be infective because the ebola virus rna may remain in the body fluid for a couple of weeks even though the risk of transmission from them is low @xcite .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume the infectious period to be 7.5 days with some possible perturbations in the interval between 6 and 16 days . in our simulation , we first fix @xmath24 days to estimate the basic reproduction number @xmath0 , inflection point @xmath1 , peak time @xmath3 and final outbreak size @xmath2 using reported cumulative case data of ebola virus in guinea , liberia and sierra leone , respectively @xcite . also , we provide the 95% confidence intervals of each estimated parameter value using bootstrap method .",
    "next , we vary the value of the parameter @xmath23 from 6 to 16 days and investigate the sensitivity of fitted parameter values .",
    "the basic reproduction number @xmath0 is estimated as 1.116 ( 95% ci : 1.115 - 1.116 ) for guinea , 1.226 ( 95% ci : 1.225 - 1.228 ) for liberia , and 1.181 ( 95% ci : 1.181 - 1.182 ) for sierra leone .",
    "the inflection point @xmath1 is estimated as 21 november 2014 for guinea , 24 october 2014 for liberia , and 28 november 2014 for sierra leone . as shown in table [ table - fit ] , the lengths of 95% confidence intervals for the estimated inflection points are no more than one day .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                 the fitted curves together with reported cumulative case data are illustrated in figure [ fig - guinea ] ( guinea ) , figure [ fig - liberia ] ( liberia ) and figure [ fig - sierraleone ] ( sierra leone ) .",
    "it is noted that in each of these three figures , there is a jump on the reported cumulative case numbers in late october 2014 .",
    "this is due to a more comprehensive assessment of patient databases on the world health organization report dated 29 october 2014 @xcite . among these three countries ,",
    "liberia has the most significant gap , which may account for the result that the inflection point for liberia is about one month earlier than the other two countries .",
    "we also fit the final outbreak size as 3268 for guinea , 8630 for liberia , and 11227 for sierra leone .",
    "all of these estimated values are smaller than cumulative case numbers reported on 18 march 2015 .",
    "this indicates that another potential outbreak wave may be approaching @xcite .",
    "now , we regularly increase the value of infectious period @xmath23 from 6 to 16 days , and conduct numerical simulations .",
    "it is noted that the fitted values of basic reproduction number @xmath0 will also increase from 1.092 to 1.252 for guinea , from 1.179 to 1.503 for liberia , and from 1.144 to 1.400 for sierra leone ; see figure [ fig - r0 ] .",
    "the estimated final outbreak size stays in a range of [ 3261 , 3307 ] for guinea , [ 8620 , 8677 ] for liberia , and [ 11209 , 11319 ] for sierra leone ; see figure [ fig - k ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the inflection point @xmath1 and peak time @xmath3 do not vary too much ; see figures [ fig - tc ] and [ fig - tp ] . for guinea",
    ", @xmath1 decreases from 266 ( 21 november 2014 ) to 264 ( 19 november 2014 ) . for liberia",
    ", @xmath1 decreases from 238 ( 24 october 2014 ) to 235 ( 21 october 2014 ) . for sierra leone ,",
    "@xmath1 decreases from 273 ( 28 november 2014 ) to 270 ( 25 november 2014 ) .",
    "the peak time @xmath3 increases from 272 ( 27 november 2014 ) to 279 ( 4 december 2014 ) for guinea , from 244 ( 30 october 2014 ) to 248 ( 3 november 2014 ) for liberia , and from 279 ( 4 december 2014 ) to 284 ( 9 december 2014 ) for sierra leone .",
    "we observe that the fitted inflection point @xmath1 and peak time @xmath3 are stable under perturbations on the infectious period @xmath23 .",
    "this study provides real - time estimation of basic reproduction number , final outbreak size , inflection point and peak time for the onging ebola outbreak in west africa using reported cumulative case data .",
    "the fitted basic reproduction numbers are smaller than those estimated in @xcite where only the data until 20 august 2014 was used .",
    "this indicates that the disease control policy became more effective during the late stage of the outbreak .",
    "we also observe that the increment speed of cumulative case number began to slow down after 21 november 2014 in guinea , 24 october 2014 in liberia , and 28 november 2014 in sierra leone .",
    "the estimated inflection points for guinea and sierra leone are close to each other , but the one for liberia is about one month earlier .",
    "this is due to a significant increase on reported cumulative case number dated 29 october 2014 ; see figure [ fig - liberia ] and @xcite .    from table [ table - fit ]",
    ", we note that the estimated peak time has about one week s delay after the estimated inflection point , while the infectious period is fixed as 7.5 days .",
    "this supports the conclusion in @xcite that the peak time occurs about one infectious period after the inflection point .",
    "if we vary the infectious period from 6 to 16 days , the estimated basic reproduction number stays in a range of [ 1.092 , 1.252 ] for guinea , [ 1.179 , 1.503 ] for liberia , and [ 1.144 , 1.400 ] for sierra leone .",
    "the estimated final outbreak size ranges from 3261 to 3307 for guinea , from 8620 to 8677 for liberia , and from 11209 to 11319 for sierra leone .",
    "the estimated inflection point and peak time are much stabler and only varies within a small interval .",
    "this demonstrates that our method has a significant accuracy in capturing the inflection point and peak time .",
    "the values of final outbreak sizes in three countries are all underestimated , which can be considered as a warning signal of a second outbreak wave .",
    "here , we provide the detail in solving the system . first , we add the two equations in to obtain @xmath25 . coupling this with the first equation of yields @xmath26 this equation is separable and its solution",
    "can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a constant of integration .",
    "next , we use the above relation to eliminate @xmath29 in the first equtaion of .",
