    "the asteroid belt is a window open on the past of the solar system , as it contains records of both its formation process and its secular evolution .",
    "however , disentangling the sequence of events that characterized its history is a difficult task , since the more ancient features have been erased or masked by the more recent ones ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for an in - depth discussion ) .",
    "we know from meteoritic constrains ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) and theoretical models ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the progenitors of the present - day asteroids formed and , in some cases , differentiated in the solar nebula on a @xmath3 ma time - scale , soon followed by jupiter and the other giant planets ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , the actual scenario for the formation of the planetesimals , its efficiency and the resulting initial size - frequency distribution are still poorly constrained .",
    "the proposed formation scenarios differ in the assumptions on the formation environment , i.e. a quiescent or a turbulent solar nebula , and produce very diverse size - frequency distributions ( sfds in the following ) of the primordial planetesimals ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the number of planetesimals populating the asteroid belt at this early time was likely @xmath4 orders of magnitude higher than the present population of asteroids @xcite , so the collisional evolution of the primordial asteroid belt was characterized by a more rapid pace than the present one @xcite .",
    "according to recent theoretical results @xcite , in a few ma the size distribution of the planetesimals in the asteroid belt spanned over @xmath5 orders of magnitude , covering the range between @xmath6 km and @xmath7 km independently on the formation mechanism .",
    "+ the present view of the evolution of the asteroid belt assumes that it underwent a major phase of depletion and enhanced collisional evolution after the dispersal of the nebular gas due to the combined perturbations of planetary embryos in the inner solar system and of the giant planets in the outer solar system @xcite .",
    "the later migration of the giant planets , suggested to be responsible for the late heavy bombardment , would have caused a second phase of depletion and possibly of enhanced collisional evolution of the asteroid belt @xcite .",
    "the violent depletion processes acting in the early solar system left then place to slower , secular depletion mechanisms .",
    "chaotic diffusion into the resonances with the giant planets has been suggested to have caused a depletion of a factor 2 of the population of large ( d @xmath8 km ) asteroids @xcite .",
    "previous studies , however , always assumed the formation time of the giant planets as negligible and the giant planets ( generally jupiter and saturn ) were introduced instantaneously and all at the same time @xcite.in our previous work ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) , we suggested instead that jupiter could have been the first giant planet to form and that its formation triggered a phase of primordial bombardment due to its rapid mass increase and its likely inward radial migration . this jovian early bombardment ( jeb in the following ) preceded the depletion phases discussed before and its duration was estimated of the order of @xmath9 ma ( see paper i ) , but it was suggested @xcite that the later formation of saturn could act to extend the duration of the jeb .",
    "after the end of the jeb and the formation of saturn , the solar system and the asteroid belt are expected to resume the evolutionary path described by the generally accepted dynamical and collisional scenarios ( see @xcite for the dynamical scenario and @xcite for the unified dynamical and collisional scenario ) .",
    "the effects of the jeb , which in paper i we investigated using vesta and ceres as case studies in view of the arrival of the nasa dawn mission at vesta , depend on the extent and the time - scale of the jovian migration but also on the sfd of the primordial planetesimals . in paper",
    "i we suggested that a solar nebula whose population of planetesimals was dominated by large ( i.e. 100 - 1000 km in diameter ) planetesimals or where jupiter s radial migration exceeded a few tenths of au would prove an extremely hostile environment for the survival of vesta and ceres .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the assumptions on the erosion of vesta and ceres due to the jeb did not account for the re - accretion of the excavated material and thus overestimated the implications of the bombardment for the survival of the two target bodies . in this paper",
    "we address the implications of the jeb for the global evolution of the asteroid belt using a more complete set of target bodies and a more realistic evaluation of the cumulative collisional erosion .",
    "in our simulations we reproduced the evolution of a template of the forming solar system across a temporal window of @xmath10 ma , located during the solar nebula phase ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and centred on the moment the planetary core of jupiter reached its critical mass and the planet started to accrete its gaseous envelope .",
    "our template of the solar system is composed by the sun , the forming jupiter , a disk of planetesimals and a set of target bodies whose perturbations on the nearby planetesimals are considered negligible . + the numerical model we used in our simulations is based on the set of equations we described in paper i :",
    "as we anticipated , in this paper we improved the model by introducing a more realistic estimate of the cumulative erosive effects of the jeb . in the following",
    "we will summarise the set of equations and the methods we used to evaluate the intensity of the jeb : for the full derivation of the equations we refer the interested readers to paper i.      in place of vesta and ceres we used as our case study in paper i , in this work we used two sets of synthetic bodies of different sizes as the targets of the jeb , to obtain a clearer picture of its effects on the planetesimals populating the asteroid belt .",
    "+ all members of each set were characterised by the same orbit : the first set of bodies was located on circular , planar orbits at @xmath11 au from the sun ( i.e. midway between the inner edge of the asteroid belt and the @xmath12 resonance with jupiter , region a in the following ) while the second set was located on circular , planar orbits at @xmath13 au from the sun ( i.e. midway between the @xmath12 and the @xmath14 resonances with jupiter , region b in the following ) .",
    "+ each set was composed by five different target bodies , characterised respectively by a diameter of @xmath0 km , @xmath1 km , @xmath2 km , @xmath15 km and @xmath16 km .",
    "an average density @xmath17 was assumed for all target bodies in order to evaluate their masses and escape velocities from the surface .",
    "the evolution of jupiter during our simulations is divided into two phases : the growth of the planetary core to its critical mass and the accretion of the nebular gas to form a massive envelope .",
    "the phase of gas accretion can also be divided into two sub - phases , a first one where the jovian mass increases exponentially and a second one where the jovian mass asymptotically approaches its final value ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+      at the beginning of our simulations , jupiter is a planetary embryo with mass @xmath18 that grows to the critical mass @xmath19 in @xmath20 years .",
    "since the total accretion time of jupiter s core is the sum of our @xmath21 to the time needed to form the initial mars - sized planetary embryo , our choice of @xmath21 is consistent with the lower limits indicated by theoretical works for the formation of jupiter s core ( a few ma , see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . during this first phase , the mass growth of jupiter is governed by the equation @xmath22 upon the reaching of the critical mass value of @xmath23 , the nebular gas surrounding jupiter is assumed to become gravitationally unstable and to be rapidly accreted by the planet to form its massive envelope . during this phase",

    ", we ignored the distinction between type i and ii migrations and started the migration of jupiter as soon as its mass reaches @xmath23 , which is equivalent to say that the value of @xmath29 becomes of the order of @xmath32 years ( ibid ) .",
    "as a consequence , jupiter moves on a circular orbit while its planetary core is growing to the critical mass and starts to spiral inward once the phase of gas accretion begins .",

    "as we described in paper i , we split the simulations into sub - simulations , each of them focusing on the dynamical evolution of a @xmath3 au - wide ring of @xmath7 test particles .",
    "each sub - simulation requires about @xmath3 month of computational time and we run a total of 48 simulations to assemble the dataset analysed in this work . the inclusion of gas drag , in particular , causes a significant increase in the impact events recorded in our simulations ( please note we are not referring to the normalized flux of impactors ) and the use of smaller time - steps due to the inward migration it forces on the planetesimals . with our choice of the numerical integrator , this translates in computational times in excess of @xmath10 months for some of the sub - simulations . we plan to explore the implications of the inclusion of planetary embryos and gas drag in future works , using a more detailed version of the model and a more efficient n - body algorithm .",
    "+ finally , the exclusion of the gravitational perturbations due to the presence of planetary embryos in the solar nebula implies that we do not take into account the depletion process of the asteroid belt @xcite across the jeb . according to @xcite , however",
    ", the presence of planetary embryos in the region of the asteroid belt does not cause a significant depletion of the planetesimals if jupiter and saturn are not present .",
    "this implies that the mass depletion process should be active only during the last @xmath164 years of our simulations .",
    "according to the results of @xcite for the case where jupiter and saturn are initially on circular orbits , the depletion of the asteroid belt on this temporal interval should amount to about @xmath165 of the original population of planetesimals . since the bulk of the jeb takes place in a few @xmath163 years",
    "( see paper i ) , the depletion of the asteroid belt should not affect our results significantly .",
    "the results we presented here have some important implications , since they add new pieces to the mosaic of our understanding of the history of the early solar system .",
    "+ first , our results show that the formation of jupiter triggers a short but intense primordial bombardment across the asteroid belt .",
    "the migration of jupiter can act to enhance its intensity but is not necessary to start the jovian early bombardment .",
    "+ second , our results clearly highlight the fact that , due to the more abundant population of the asteroid belt at the time of the jovian early bombardment , cumulative erosion plays a more important role than that of critical impacts in determining the fate of the planetesimals .",
    "such effects , not included in previous studies of the collisional history of the asteroid belt ( e.g. @xcite ) , could help to explain the long equivalent time - scale ( @xmath166 ga instead of the real @xmath167 ga , ibid ) needed to achieve the degree of collisional evolution of the present - day asteroid belt .",
    "+ third , our results suggest that the generally accepted view that most asteroids of about @xmath0 km in diameter or larger are primordial may not be correct .",
    "we showed that the exact threshold size depends on the considered region of the asteroid belt , on the extent of jupiter s migration , and on the size - frequency distribution of the planetesimals at the time of the jovian early bombardment .",
    "we can generally state that , if the population of planetesimals in the solar nebula was dominated by objects smaller than @xmath0 km , the threshold size can be of the order of @xmath1 km . if , instead , the solar nebula was populated by planetesimals larger than @xmath0 km , the threshold size can rise up to about @xmath2 km .",
    "planetesimals in the @xmath147 km size range are large enough to differentiate due to the energy released by the decay of short - lived radionuclides ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) : the largest planetesimals disrupted by the jovian early bombardment may therefore represent the parent bodies of the most ancient differentiated meteorites .",
    "+ fourth , our results support the claim we made in paper i that the survival of vesta to the jovian early bombardment could be used to constrain the dynamical evolution of jupiter .",
    "our improved estimates of the collisional effects of the jovian early bombardment indicate that , even in the least erosive scenarios , planetesimals of about @xmath2 km in diameter would be stripped of @xmath168 of their original mass if jupiter migrated by about @xmath3 au . therefore",
    ", if vesta formed near its present orbit its survival to the jovian early bombardment suggests that jupiter s migration was less than @xmath3 au ( see paper i for a discussion ) .",
    "+ fifth , as we discussed in @xcite our results suggest that the formation of saturn would trigger a second phase of bombardment , possibly less intense than the jovian early bombardment due to the lower mass of saturn and the depletion caused in the solar nebula by the formation of jupiter .",
    "if the formation of saturn took place only a few @xmath163 years after that of jupiter , these two phases of bombardment would overlap into a single event , which in analogy to the late heavy bombardment we called the primordial heavy bombardment @xcite .",
    "the enhanced collisional activity of the inner solar system caused by either the jovian early bombardment or the primordial heavy bombardment could prove extremely important to discriminate between the standard scenario for the evolution of the solar nebula we assumed in this work or alternative scenarios like the one recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "+ finally , since the physical processes considered here are general to planetary systems harbouring forming giant planets , our results indicate that the formation of an extrasolar giant planet in a circumstellar disk would trigger a phase of bombardment whose duration ( i.e. about @xmath9 ma ) would be a significant fraction of the lifetime of the disk itself ( i.e. about @xmath166 ma , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the erosive effects of such an extrasolar primordial heavy bombardment on already formed planetesimals would cause a sustained production of dust characterized by a large grain size ( from tens of microns to cm , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the amount , the physical properties or the location of the dust produced by giant planet - induced bombardments differ significantly from those of the dust due to the collisional cascade caused by the presence of planetary embryos as observed in debris disks ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) , the enhancements in the dust population observed in circumstellar disks ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) could in principle be used to identify those systems were the formation of extrasolar giant planets is taking place .",
    "the exploration of this possibility is the subject of ongoing research and will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "diego turrini and gianfranco magni wish to dedicate this work to their friend and colleague angioletta coradini , who passed away after a long illness on september 5th , 2011 .",
    "the authors also wish to thank the reviewer , john chambers , for his comments on the manuscript and the results .",

    "<S> the progenitors of the present - day asteroids formed in the solar nebula almost contemporary to the giant planets . </S>",
    "<S> the actual process producing the first generation of asteroids is uncertain , strongly depending on the physical characteristics of the solar nebula , and the different scenarios produce very diverse initial size - frequency distributions . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the implications of the formation of jupiter , plausibly the first giant planet to form , on the evolution of the primordial asteroid belt . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of jupiter triggered a short but intense period of primordial bombardment , previously unaccounted for , which caused an early phase of enhanced collisional evolution in the asteroid belt . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that this jovian early bombardment caused the erosion or the disruption of bodies smaller than a threshold size , which strongly depends on the size - frequency distribution of the primordial planetesimals . </S>",
    "<S> if the asteroid belt was dominated by planetesimals less than @xmath0 km in diameter , the primordial bombardment would have caused the erosion of bodies smaller than @xmath1 km in diameter . </S>",
    "<S> if the asteroid belt was instead dominated by larger planetesimals , the bombardment would have resulted in the destruction of bodies as big as @xmath2 km . </S>"
