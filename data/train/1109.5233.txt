    "<S> , we measure the coherent scattering of light from the collective motion of thousands of ultracold atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering asymmetry acts as a self - calibrating thermometer for the atoms collective phonon occupation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , owing to high cavity - atom cooperativity and thermal isolation in our system , the cavity mode acts as the dominant channel for energy flux to our mechanical system . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of light emitted from the cavity therefore serves as a record of the energy exchanged between motion and the light field . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this energy transfer represents the necessary minimum diffusive heating of a continuous backaction - limited quantum position measurement .    our experiment ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : apparatus ] ) begins with an ensemble of 4,000 ultracold @xmath4rb atoms . </S>",

    "<S> unlike solid - state resonators , which are coupled to their material environments , the atoms here are isolated _ in vacuo _ , and the thermal `` bath '' for the measured collective oscillation consists of the remaining collective modes of atomic motion . </S>",
    "<S> after raising the trap potential to its final strength , the bath has an initial temperature of @xmath27 , corresponding to a mode occupation of 0.54 phonons .    </S>",
    "<S> the atomic motion scatters cavity photons via collective virtual electronic excitations , causing transitions between collective motional energy levels ( _ i.e. _ , collective raman scattering ) . in this process </S>",
    "<S> , the collective atomic oscillator can absorb a mechanical energy quantum , thereby downconverting the emitted photon by @xmath28 ( stokes scattering ) . if the oscillator is not in its ground state , it can alternatively upconvert the photon by @xmath28 , thereby losing an energy quantum ( anti - stokes scattering ) . by fermi s golden rule , </S>",
    "<S> the rates for upconversion and downconversion , from an oscillator in its @xmath29th excited state , are proportional to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a ground - state oscillator ( @xmath32 ) will thus scatter only to the stokes sideband , with more symmetric scattering indicative of higher phonon occupation .    </S>",
    "<S> the fourier spectrum @xmath33 of photons emitted from the cavity , at a frequency @xmath34 relative to the probe , and normalized by the discrete fourier window time , can be calculated by solving a set of quantum langevin equations @xcite , yielding @xmath35,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the oscillator s mean phonon occupation . </S>",
    "<S> here we have parameterized the photon scattering rate by the dimensionless optomechanical cooperativity @xcite @xmath37 , which combines @xmath38 , the mechanical damping rate @xmath39 , the mean intracavity probe photon number @xmath40 , and the cavity half - linewidth @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) . in our atoms </S>",
    "<S> - based optomechanical system , @xmath43 , and the cooperativity can be tuned over many orders of magnitude by varying the probe intensity and @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> we measure the stokes asymmetry by integrating the optical power @xmath44 scattered to frequencies near @xmath45 , detected using a balanced heterodyne receiver . </S>",
    "<S> the detector measures a power spectral density @xmath46 $ ] , where @xmath47 is the mean shot - noise spectrum as measured by the detector and @xmath48 is the spectrum of technical noise , which contributes less than @xmath49 to the observed spectrum at @xmath45 . the quantum efficiency for measuring intracavity photons is @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> for each run of the experiment we measure the spectral density @xmath51 with atoms and @xmath52 without atoms ( which measures @xmath53 ) , and then measure @xmath47 by extinguishing the probe beam . </S>",
    "<S> the unitless photon spectrum is then @xmath54 . in order to avoid excessive accumulated heating of the atomic gas , we acquire data for only 5  ms each run of the experiment , after which we observe the mechanical resonance to broaden significantly .    </S>",
    "<S> measured spectra are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : thermometry ] . at the lowest optomechanical cooperativites ( _ viz . </S>",
    "<S> _ , a weak probe detuned far from atomic resonance ) , the probe contributes only minimally to the phonon occupation . </S>",
    "<S> rather , the collective mode occupation should approach the average thermal occupation ( @xmath55 phonons , measured via time - of - flight thermometry ) . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a large stokes asymmetry : @xmath56 , corresponding to a phonon occupation @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that such a `` stokes thermometer '' is self - calibrating , in that no experimental parameters are involved in extracting the phonon occupation number .    </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical resonance widths of the observed spectra are generally larger than the true mechanical damping rate , which we find by probing to the blue of cavity resonance and finding the phonon lasing threshold @xcite , at which point the mechanical damping rate is equal to the optomechanical amplification rate . in our system , we find a damping rate of @xmath58 . comparing to the observed inhomogenous linewidth of @xmath59 indicates that @xmath21 dephases into approximately 2 to 3 collective normal modes , each containing 1,500 to 2,000 atoms . we suspect that this dephasing is due mostly to slight differences in trap curvature in adjacent potential minima arising from the probe beam @xcite , and partly to the anharmonicity of the standing - wave optical trap .    </S>",
    "<S> we next apply the sideband thermometer to probe the effects of measurement backaction . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum measurement of position must be accompanied by a corresponding motional disturbance @xcite . in this experiment , where @xmath60 , we expect an increase in the phonon occupation by an amount @xmath1 . as we increase the cooperativity , the sideband asymmetry decreases as theoretically predicted . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we can compare the collective mode s mean phonon occupation to an upper bound on the mean single - atom phonon occupation @xmath61 , extracted by measuring the gas temperature using time - of - flight thermometry . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound is derived by assigning the gas s entire temperature increase after @xmath62  ms of probing ( equivalent to many motional equilibration times ) to the mean single - atom motion along the cavity axis . </S>",
    "<S> the large discrepancy observed between the optically detected and single - atom occupations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : thermometry]b ) highlights the fact that our detector senses the collective motion of the gas , rather than the motion of individual atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the optical spectrum moreover serves as a record of the energy exchanged between light and motion . </S>",
    "<S> a photon recorded at frequency @xmath34 indicates the emission of an energy @xmath63 from the atoms into the cavity field . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral density of energy - exchange is @xmath64 ( units of w / hz ) , and the total power passing from the light to motion is @xcite @xmath65 heat - exchange spectra for several values of the cooperativity , as well as heating rates taken from integrating over the sidebands , are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : exchange ] . </S>",
    "<S> the heating rates agree well with the prediction of measurement backaction . </S>",
    "<S> we additionally correlate the total energy exchanged with the atoms to the increase in the ( finite ) bath s temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the bath temperature should increase by an amount given by equating the backaction heat with the temperature integral of the gas s heat capacity , which we calculate using bose - einstein statistics for axial motion and the ideal gas law for radial motion . </S>",
    "<S> we find quantitative agreement to this theory as we vary both the cooperativity and the probe duration .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated the quantization of the collective motion of thousands of atoms , observing stokes asymmetry and zero - point motion . </S>",
    "<S> the stokes asymmetry provides a self - calibrating thermometer for low - occupation collective modes . </S>",
    "<S> we have in addition observed the spectrum of energy exchanged between light and collective atomic motion , spectroscopically identifying backaction heating from a quantum position measurement . </S>",
    "<S> while our system measures center - of - mass motion , other modes @xcite of physical interest could be addressed by tailoring the light - motion interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for example , quadrupole @xcite or scissors @xcite modes could be sensed using quadratic optomechanical coupling @xcite , allowing for precise measurements of the effects of interactions , superfluidity , and viscosity in degenerate bose and fermi gases . </S>",
