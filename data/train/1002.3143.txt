    "study of non - perturbative pair creation from a classical electric field , which is known as the schwinger mechanism @xcite , has a long history and wide range of applications ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "one of those applications can be found in studies of relativistic heavy - ion collisions , where the schwinger mechanism has been used as a mechanism of matter formation from a color flux tube @xcite .",
    "the color flux - tube model assumes that a strong color electric field is formed in a beam direction just after two nuclei collide and pass through each other @xcite .",
    "formation of longitudinal color electric fields is also predicted in the framework of color glass condensate @xcite .",
    "therefore , particle production due to the schwinger mechanism attracts renewed interest @xcite .    under these circumstances , getting an understanding of how an initial electric field and created particles evolve in time is of prime importance . to properly describe the time evolution ,",
    "calculating vacuum persistence probability or pair creation probability , which were first derived by schwinger , is not sufficient @xcite , and an electric field should be treated as a dynamical variable rather than a background field controlled by hand , i.e. back reaction should be taken into account .",
    "there have been considerable numbers of studies treating back reaction ; the ones based on a kinetic theory @xcite and the others on quantum field theory @xcite . to our knowledge , however , field theoretical treatment of the back reaction problem under a _ color _ electric field has been lacking .",
    "therefore , in this paper we investigate the pair creation of quarks under a color electric field incorporating back reaction .",
    "in studies of physics under non - abelian electromagnetic fields , su(2 ) theory has been often used for simplicity . in the case of su(3 ) , however , a new feature arises : anisotropy in color space .",
    "it has been shown that an su(3 ) color electric field has two independent directions and it is characterized by two gauge invariant parameters : one of them is determined by its field strength and the other is related with the color direction of the field @xcite . more generally , an su(@xmath0 ) color vector has @xmath1-independent directions in color space , and physical contents can generally depend on a color direction of an electric field @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we deal with su(3 ) color electric fields and examine the color direction dependence .    not only new features which arise in non - abelian fields",
    ", we also analyze phenomena whose essence is common to the abelian case",
    ". collective motion of created particles which couples to an electric field shows plasma oscillation . during this evolution ,",
    "several phenomena are observed : suppression of pair creation or annihilation of the particles due to the pauli blocking , damping of the electric field , and rapid oscillations in the momentum distribution of the created particles due to interference .",
    "we shall give an analysis of these phenomena to advance an understanding of physics in pair creation .",
    "we take a uniform color electric field as an initial state .",
    "pressure of this initial state is quite anisotropic : the longitudinal pressure is negative and the transverse pressure is positive .",
    "therefore , if local thermalization is achieved starting from the flux - tube initial condition , isotropization of pressure should be needed during the time evolution .",
    "however , the full understanding of a thermalization process in heavy - ion collisions has not been obtained . in this paper",
    ", we examine the role of pair creation for the isotropization of pressure as a first step to understand a mechanism of thermalization in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "one of remarkable differences of the color flux tube given by the color glass condensate from that in the original flux - tube model is the existence of a longitudinal color magnetic field in addition to an electric field @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a longitudinal magnetic field enhances pair creation of fermions and speeds up the decay of an electric field in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "we extend it to the quark pair creation under a longitudinal color electric and magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , we study induction of chiral charge due to pair creation under a magnetic field .",
    "since the chiral anomaly is a semi - classical effect where the quantum aspect of a gauge field is unnecessary , we can also apply our framework to study the chiral anomaly due to pair creation .",
    "the relation between pair creation and the chiral anomaly has been also studied in refs .",
    "emergence of a nonzero chirality in heavy - ion collisions attracts interest in the context of the chiral magnetic effect @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we shall explain the abelianization of a color electromagnetic field , and introduce the parameter characterizing the color direction of the field .",
    "although this formalism is essentially the same as that given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we make the existence of color direction dependence clearer with the help of the method in refs .",
    "@xcite . in section [ sec : canonical ] , we introduce time - dependent particle picture to describe the time evolution of the system",
    ". then , we shall show our numerical results in section [ sec : ele ] .",
    "time evolution of momentum distribution functions of created quarks , color current density , electric field strength and pressure of the system are displayed and discussed .",
    "color direction dependence of the results is also examined there . in section [ sec : mag ] , effects of a longitudinal magnetic field , i.e. enhancement of pair creation and induction of chiral charge , are discussed .",
    "quark pair creation incorporated with back reaction is described by the following lagrangian density @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a quark field and color indices @xmath4 are omitted .",
    "we assume for simplicity that each flavor has the same mass @xmath5 , and flavor indices are also omitted .",
    "the number of flavor is set to be @xmath6 throughout this paper .",
    "the covariant derivative and the field strengths are defined in terms of a background gauge field @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the generator in the fundamental representation of gauge group su(@xmath10 ) , and @xmath11 is the anti - symmetric structure constant ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath13 and @xmath3 now read @xmath14 because we treat the gauge field @xmath7 as a classical background field , the charge current operator @xmath15 in eq .",
    "is replaced by its expectation value @xmath16 in the following .",
    "these coupled equations govern the pair creation and its back reaction .",
    "we restrict the background field to spatially homogeneous and abelian - like one , which is expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an abelianized field strength and is independent of the space coordinates .",
    "@xmath19 is a constant vector indicating a color orientation of the electromagnetic field , and is normalized so that @xmath20 .",
    "this field strength is given by the gauge field @xmath21 the relation between @xmath18 and @xmath22 is just the same as that in the abelian case : @xmath23    under the abelianized gauge field , the covariant derivative reads @xmath24 .",
    "because @xmath25 is an @xmath26 hermitian matrix , we can diagonalize it by a unitary transformation acquire space dependence , and the method used in this paper is no longer applicable.](global gauge transformation ) : @xmath27 .",

    "is an usual weight diagram for a fundamental representation of su(3 ) .",

    "fig.[fig : triangle ] is a graphical representation of eqs .. each @xmath29 is given by the @xmath32 coordinate of each vertex of the rotated triangle ( weight diagram ) . owing to the symmetry of the diagram , it is sufficient to take the angle @xmath33 restricted to @xmath45",
    "to describe the time evolution of the system , we introduce an instantaneous particle picture and quantize the field using that particle picture .",
    "of course , a definition of particle in the presence of a pair - creating background is rather ambiguous .",
    "thus , the instantaneous particle picture should be regarded as our working definition to describe the system evolution . to calculate field quantities such as current and energy density , we need to identify and subtract the contribution from the dirac sea at each time .",
    "we can do this just by the normal ordering in terms of the instantaneous particle basis , and then energy conservation is automatically guaranteed @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can interpret defining a particle picture at each time as a means to properly regularize field quantities , and can consider particle number at intermediate time as a byproduct .",
    "nevertheless , we will show time evolution of a particle number or momentum distribution function defined through the instantaneous particle picture in the following , because it behaves in a physically reasonable manner , and helps us understand the dynamics of this system .",
    "first , we consider only the electric fields .",
    "we will introduce the magnetic fields in section [ sec : mag ] .",

    "are indeed enhanced by the magnetic field , and as a consequence the frequency of the plasma oscillation increases .",
    "we can estimate @xmath97 , which is a typical time scale of back reaction , in the same way as that in section [ subsec : pp ] , and obtain @xmath98 this is a decreasing function of @xmath99 .    because only the lowest @xmath100 mode mainly contributes under a strong magnetic field modes . ] , the results in the massless case ( @xmath91 ) and those with nonzero mass ( @xmath101 ) show drastic difference [ fig.[fig : current_mag2 ] ] , whereas in the absence of a magnetic field , there is no considerable difference between them [ fig.[fig : current1 ] ] .",
    "the particle number density is especially remarkable : its time evolution becomes nearly periodic in the massless case .",
    "similar behavior of a particle number has been obtained by iwazaki @xcite in a different way .",
    "emergence of this periodic behavior is consistent with our contention that the polarization current and the interference of distributions are the source of apparent irreversibility of time , because as noted in sections [ subsec : damping ] and [ subsec : interference ] , the zero mode contributes to neither the polarization current nor the interference term .",
    "the magnetic field has another effect : induction of chiral charge . because the lowest landau level ( @xmath102 ) is occupied only by particles with spin parallel to the magnetic field ( @xmath103 ) , the balance between spin-@xmath104 and @xmath105 is broken and thus chiral charge is induced .",
    "we consider the chiral charge density given by the following equation @xmath106 in the chiral limit ( @xmath107 ) , the chiral charge equals the difference between the number of right - handed particles and that of left - handed particles .    substituting eq . into eq . and subtracting a divergent part by the normal ordering , we can express the chiral charge density in terms of the distribution functions : @xmath108 .\\ ] ] note that only the lowest mode contributes to @xmath109 .",

    "equation is indeed satisfied . due to plasma oscillation",
    ", the chiral charge density shows oscillation .",
    "as noted in the previous subsection , time evolution is nearly periodic in the chiral limit [ fig.[fig : chiral](a ) ] .",
    "this curve of @xmath114 becomes exactly a sine one in the limit of a strong magnetic field @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath110 , the term @xmath116 grows , and the periodicity seen in @xmath114 is destroyed .",
    "we have studied the time evolution of the system where quantum quark fields and a classical color electric field are dynamically coupled with each other . by the procedure of abelianization , we have reduced the equations of motion to the same form as in the abelian case .",
    "effective coupling strength of each quark with the abelianized electromagnetic field depends on the direction of the field in color space .",
    "therefore , the longitudinal momentum distributions of created quarks greatly depend on the color direction of the gauge field [ fig.[fig : ldis2 ] ] .",
    "however , we have found that the color current density and total particle density are rather insensitive to the color orientation of the field since those quantities are obtained after summing up all the color components [ fig.[fig : current2 ] ] .",
    "we have obtained the oscillating behavior of the longitudinal momentum distributions , and estimated its typical time scale @xmath97 [ eq . ] using the empirical analytic expression for the quark distributions .",
    "this @xmath97 also gives a time scale of net particle production .",
    "the increase of the quark number density is concentrated at initial time and gets saturated after @xmath97 [ fig.[fig : current1](c ) ] .",
    "let us roughly estimate @xmath97 with the parameters motivated by the color glass condensate ; @xmath117 and @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a saturation scale . then eq . yields @xmath120 note in passing that the @xmath33 dependence of @xmath97 is also small , 2% effect , at most , in the present case .",
    "this @xmath97 is not drastically small compared with the typical time scale of the initial stage of heavy - ion collisions , such as thermalization time expected from hydrodynamic calculations @xmath121 fm ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , this estimation incorporates only the effect of quark pair creation .",
    "if gluon pair creation is taken into account , @xmath97 would become much smaller .",
    "pair creation of gluons is stronger than that of quarks because ( i ) gluons are boson , so that they are bose - enhanced rather than pauli - blocked , and ( ii ) effective coupling of gluons to an electric field is larger than that of quarks . for gluons ,",
    "a rotating hexagon is obtained , of which vertices are on a circle with a radius of 1 being bigger than @xmath122 in the quark case .",
    "] however , applying the method in the present paper to gluon pair creation , we encounter a difficulty of infrared divergence . furthermore , under a magnetic field",
    ", one particle energy of a gluon in the lowest landau level becomes imaginary and instability occurs , which is known as the nielsen  olesen instability @xcite .",
    "thus , we need to resolve these difficulties in order to treat both the quark pair and gluon pair creations in our framework in a unified manner .",
    "in addition to the plasma oscillation , we have pointed out that the response of vacuum to the electric field involves several phenomena such as the pauli blocking , damping of the electric field and rapid oscillations in the quark distribution . in particular",
    ", it has been revealed that the cause of the rapid oscillations is the interference between the particles .",
    "because of this interference , the distribution becomes sensitive to the phase of the bogoliubov coefficients .",
    "furthermore , we have found that apparent irreversibility of time evolution is induced by nonzero transverse mass modes through the polarization current and the interference .",
    "also the time evolution of pressure of the system has been calculated .",
    "we have shown that the initial anisotropy in pressure is moderated by pair creation and back reaction even though our treatment is a mean field one .",
    "if effects of collisions among particles are taken into account , in other words , if quantum gauge fields are introduced , the system would be more isotropized .",
    "it is hoped to investigate these effects , as well as effects of non - uniformity of electromagnetic fields .",
    "finally , we have discussed the effects of a magnetic field on quark pair creation .",
    "we have shown that a magnetic field enhances pair creation because of the emergence of the landau level and the spin - magnetic field interaction . as a result ,",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field speeds up the decay of the electric field .",
    "this mechanism may have significance in the context of heavy - ion collisions .",
