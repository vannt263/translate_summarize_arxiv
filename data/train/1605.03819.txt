    "two very well known , empirically established laws of planetary scale friction ( i.e. , seismology ) are the gutenberg - richter ( gr ) law  @xcite and the omori law  @xcite . the former states that the number of earthquakes ( eqs ) with magnitude @xmath0 scales with @xmath1 as @xmath2 where the dimensionless magnitude is defined as @xmath3 @xmath4 is a measure of the eq amplitude ( energy released , stress drop , etc . )",
    ", @xmath5 is a constant , and @xmath6 ( or more generally @xmath7  @xcite ) .",
    "the omori law describes the rate of aftershocks ( in excess of the background value ) at time @xmath8 after the main event , @xmath9 where @xmath10 depends exponentially on the magnitude @xmath11 of the main shock , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 has a typical average value of about 7  hours , and @xmath14 ( or more generally @xmath15  @xcite ) .",
    "a similar behavior ( with @xmath16 ) was also reported for foreshocks  @xcite .",
    "both the gr law and the omori law were established through a statistical analysis of observed eqs . although widely addressed and discussed theoretically  , a generally accepted frictional model whose solution simultaneously accounts for both laws seems to be still lacking .",
    "we build on the time honored spring - block eq model dating back to burridge and knopoff ( bk )  @xcite , and subsequent work  @xcite , where two rough sliding plates are coupled by a set of contacts which deform when the plates move relative to one another .",
    "the contacts are frictional , behaving as elastic springs as long as their stresses are below some threshold , breaking to reattach in a less - stressed state when the threshold is exceeded .",
    "the eq amplitude @xmath4 is typically associated with the number of broken contacts at a global slip sliding event  the shock .",
    "the bk - type models do predict a gr - like power - law behavior , but typically for some particular sets of model parameters ( see a detailed analyzes of bk - type models in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and generally only for a restricted interval of magnitudes @xmath17  @xcite , unlike the much broader one observed in real eqs , @xmath18  @xcite . beyond that partial failure",
    ", the existing eq models do not describe spatial - temporal correlations between different eqs and thus fail altogether to explain the omori law .",
    "aftershocks have been generally related to relaxation  @xcite , but that aspect is still in need of proper integration with others in a single model  @xcite .",
    "we undertake that integration in the present work , where we show that a simultaneous description of both the gr law and the omori law can be obtained by models that incorporate two main ingredients : the elasticity of the sliding plates and the ageing of contacts between the plates .",
    "as typical in eq - like models , we assume two plates , the top plate ( the slider ) and the bottom plate ( the base ) , coupled by a multiplicity of frictional micro - contacts . if an individual micro - contact ( asperity , bridge , solid island , etc",
    "have a size @xmath19 , then its elastic constant may be estimated as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the mass density and @xmath22 is the transverse sound velocity of the material which forms the asperity .",
    "elastic theory introduces a characteristic distance @xmath23 known as the elastic correlation length , below which the frictional interface may be considered as rigid  @xcite .",
    "roughly it may be estimated as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is an average distance between the micro - contacts and @xmath26 is the slider young modulus .",
    "a set of @xmath27 micro - contacts within the area @xmath28 constitutes an effective macro - contact  @xcite with the elastic constant @xmath29 .",
    "the macro - contact is characterized by a shear force @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the displacement of the point on the slider to which the @xmath32th macro - contact is attached .",
    "the function @xmath30 may be calculated with the master equation approach  @xcite provided the statistical properties of micro - contacts are known . because of a strong ( coulomb - like ) elastic interaction between the micro - contacts at distances @xmath33 , the effective distribution of threshold values for frictional micro - contacts reduces to a narrow gaussian distribution , i.e.",
    ", it is close to @xmath34-function  @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath35 linearly increases with @xmath31 until the macro - contact undergoes the elastic instability  @xcite , when ( almost all ) micro - contacts break and the macro - contact slides .",
    "thus , we assume that each macro - contact ( simply called contact from now on ) is characterized by a shear force @xmath36 and by a threshold value @xmath37 .",
    "the contact stretches elastically so long as @xmath38 , but breaks and slides when the threshold is exceeded .",
    "when a contact breaks , its shear force drops to @xmath39 , and evolution continues from there , with a new freshly assigned value for its successive breaking threshold .",
    "the macro - contacts are elastically coupled through the deformation of the slider s bulk . the elastic energy stored between two nearest neighboring ( nn ) contacts @xmath32 and @xmath40 in a non - uniformly deformed slider",
    "may formally be written as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the slider rigidity defined below in sec .",
    "[ model - elastic ] . within this multiscale theory of the frictional interface , the sliding proceeds through creation and propagation of self - healing cracks treated as solitary waves  @xcite .",

    "the tb and il are coupled by springs of elastic constant @xmath46 .",
    "the il is connected with the rigid bottom block ( bb ) by contacts , represented by `` frictional '' springs of elastic constant @xmath47 , which break when the local stress exceeds a threshold value .",
    ", width=302 ]    an earthquake corresponds to a release of elastic energy accumulated in a body of the plate during its previous slow motion .",
    "therefore , any eq model has to include the plate elasticity . in a majority of eq - like models",
    "this is done indirectly through introducing an interaction between neighboring contacts .",
    "for example , the most widely studied ofc model  @xcite assumes that when the stress on one of the contacts reaches a threshold value @xmath48 , it breaks , and the accumulated stress is equally redistributed over the nn contacts , increasing their stresses on @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a parameter .",
    "this may stimulate the nn contacts to break too , creating an avalanche of contact breaking  a large shock .",
    "the distribution of shock magnitudes in this case may follow the power law .",
    "however , such explanation of the gr law is not `` robust''the power law is observed for some sets of model parameters and for a restricted interval of eq magnitudes , typically much smaller than that observed in real eqs . instead",
    ", the gr law may be associated with macro - contact ageing alone as discussed previously  @xcite ( see also sec .  [ model - ageing ] ) .    nevertheless , the incorporation of the plate elasticity into a realistic eq model is still important because , as we shall show in this work , it is responsible for aftershocks .",
    "when one of the macro - contacts breaks and slides , the stress on neighboring contacts increases causing them to break as well , and this process continues for some distance @xmath51 , where the contact stress drops below than ( but close to ) its threshold value . during propagation of this `` breaking wave''corresponding to a large eq , or the main shock  the previously accumulated elastic energy is released .",
    "but an important issue is that the stress is not completely relaxed  the region where the wave was arrested , retains a stress close to the threshold value and thus represents a source for the next eq  the aftershock .",
    "the driving force which supports the propagation of the breaking wave , is the stress accumulated in the body of the plate , i.e. , the latter plays the role of a `` stress reservoir '' . because of the long - range character of stress distribution in an elastic body ( the stress decays with distance according to a power law )",
    ", this effect can not be described by ofc - like models , where the stress is localized ; therefore one has to use a three - dimensional ( 3d ) model of the plate .",
    "a full fledge simulation of a 3d eq model seems still out of reach of modern computer power . instead",
    ", here we propose the two - layer model of the sliding plate , where one layer ( il ) plays the same role as in bk - type models , while the second layer ( tb ) plays the role of a massive tectonic plate , where the elastic stress is accumulated .    to be specific we elaborate here the simplest one - dimensional ( 1d ) version of the model , where the contacts constitute a regular chain of length @xmath52 with the spacing @xmath53 as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ a01 ] ( see appendix  [ app - elastic ] for reasons how the 1d model may be `` deduced '' from the 3d elastic model of the plate and the corresponding parameters , eqs .",
    "( [ cra03][cra05 ] ) below , be defined ) .",
    "the base ( the bottom block bb ) is assumed to be rigid , whereas the elastic top plate ( the top block tb , the slider ) of length @xmath54 , width @xmath55 ( in our 1d model we must set @xmath56 ) and an effective height ( thickness ) @xmath57 is modelled by the chain of @xmath58 rigid blocks coupled by springs of elastic constant @xmath59 ( note that @xmath60 must hold for the correlation length @xmath23 to be defined ) .",
    "the contact between the tb and bb is described as an interface layer ( il ) of thickness @xmath61 , consisting of @xmath62 contacts coupled by springs with elastic constant @xmath63 the il and tb are coupled elastically with a transverse rigidity which we model by @xmath62 springs of elastic constant @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the slider poisson ratio . finally , the il is coupled `` frictionally '' with the top surface of the bb ",
    "each contact between the two plates is elastic with stiffness constant @xmath47 as long as the local shear stress in the il is below the threshold .",
    "the interface is stiff if @xmath66 and soft when @xmath67 ; here we concentrate on the latter case .",
    "now , if a lateral pushing force is applied , for example , to the left - hand side of the slider as shown in fig .",
    "[ a01 ] , the stress is transmitted to each contact due to the elasticity of the slider . in this case",
    "the interface dynamics starts by relaxation of the leftmost contact which initiates the sliding .",
    "this causes an extra stress on the neighboring contacts , which tend to slide too , and the domino of sliding events propagates as a solitary wave  @xcite , extending the relaxed domain , until the stress at some contact will fall below the threshold .",
    "such a self - healing crack propagates for some characteristic length @xmath51leaving a relaxed stress behind its passage , but raising the interface shear stress ahead of the crack . the value of @xmath51 may be estimated analytically  @xcite ; roughly @xmath68 is proportional to @xmath69 as well as to @xmath70 .",
    "the importance of incorporation of interface ageing  an effective strengthening of the interface due to slow relaxations , growth of the contact sizes , or their gradual reconstruction , chemical `` cementation '' , etc.is well known for eq modelling as well as for tribological studies  @xcite .",
    "in particular , ageing is held responsible for well - known effect  the transition from stick - slip to smooth sliding with changing of the sliding velocity @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "typically ageing is accounted for phenomenologically by assuming that the friction force decreases when @xmath71 increases ( the velocity - weakening hypothesis ) . at the simplest level",
    ", one may just postulate the existence of two coefficients , the static friction coefficient @xmath72 for the pinned state and the kinetic friction coefficient @xmath73 for the sliding state .    in the eq - like model , where the contacts continuously break and reform ,",
    "it is natural to assume that newborn contacts have initially a small ( e.g. , zero ) breaking threshold which then grows with the timelife of the pinned contact . in the simplest variant one",
    "may introduce simply a delay time by assuming that the contact reappears after some time @xmath74 ( so that for times @xmath75 the threshold is zero ) .    in our model , where one macro - contact is represented by many micro - contacts",
    "which break and reform , it is natural to assume that the macro - contact possess its own internal dynamics corresponding to a stochastic process .",
    "let @xmath37 be a threshold value for contact @xmath32 . even assuming , as we will do , that newborn contacts emerge with a vanishing breaking threshold @xmath76 , that threshold value will grow with time due to contact ageing .",
    "we assume that the stochastic evolution of contact thresholds is described by the simplest langevin equation @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the so - called drift and stochastic forces respectively  @xcite , and @xmath80 is the gaussian random force , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq31 ] ) is equivalent to the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for the distribution of thresholds @xmath83 ( see appendix [ app - ageing ] ) : @xmath84    our main assumption , ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the drift force is given by @xmath85 while the amplitude of the stochastic force is @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are two dimensionless parameters , and the model parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 define the space - time scale and are fixed below in sec .",

    "therefore , the dimensionless parameter @xmath88 determines the deviation of the threshold distribution from the gaussian shape , while @xmath87 corresponds to the rate of ageing .",
    "the stochastic dynamics alone leads to the power - law distribution of thresholds in the stationary state .",
