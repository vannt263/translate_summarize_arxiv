    "currently , the atlas and cms groups exclude a substantial region of the possible higgs boson mass range , and find several higgs like events around the locations of @xmath19 ( atlas ) and @xmath20 ( cms ) @xcite . further searching for higgs boson and studying its properties",
    "are still the important tasks for the present and upcoming high energy colliders .    despite the tremendous success of the sm in describing the high energy physics at the energy scale up to several hundred @xmath21",
    ", the instability of the higgs boson mass leads to the  hierarchy problem ",
    "@xcite which comes from the quadratic loop corrections to the higgs boson mass . in order to give a proper electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) scale ,",
    "the higgs boson mass needs unnatural fine - tuning when it gets a radiative correction with the cutoff scale about @xmath22 . in order to solve the  hierarchy problem  , physicists developed several new particle models such as supersymmetry @xcite , extra dimensions @xcite , little higgs @xcite , technicolor and so on . among these theories ,",
    "the little higgs models are proposed as one kind of models without fine - tuning in which the higgs boson is naturally light as a result of nonlinearly realized symmetry .",

    "this process could be used to measure the higgs mass and the couplings between higgs boson and gauge bosons and determine the quantum numbers of the higgs boson .",
    "therefore , investigating the process @xmath33 at the lhc in the context of the lhm is necessary for probing the lhm physics @xcite .",
    "we find that the sm and minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) analyses to the @xmath33 process at the lhc have been already existed in ref.@xcite .",
