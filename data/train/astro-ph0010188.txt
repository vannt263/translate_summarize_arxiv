    "the unified model for seyfert galaxies proposes that all types of seyfert galaxy are fundamentally the same , however , the presence of an optically thick structure obscures the broad line region ( blr ) in many systems . in this paper",
    "it is assumed that , in the majority of seyfert 2s , this structure is a dusty molecular  torus \" although other galactic structures ( e.g.  dust lanes / starbursts , see malkan , gorjian and tam , 1998 ) can perform the same role . in this scenario",
    "the classification of a seyfert 1 or seyfert 2 galaxy ( seyfert 1broad permitted lines , seyfert 2narrow permitted lines ) depends on the inclination of the torus to the line of sight ( antonucci , 1993 ) .",
    "probably the most convincing evidence for this model comes from optical spectropolarimetry . using this technique , the scattered emission from the blr of many seyfert 2s",
    "is revealed in the form of broad lines in the polarised flux ( e.g.  antonucci and miller , 1985 , young et al , 1996 , heisler , lumsden and bailey , 1997 ) .    in this unified picture",
    "the high energy central source emission ( optical to x - ray continuum ) is absorbed by the dust within the torus which re - emits this energy at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths .",
    "independent strong support has been given by hard x - ray ( hx , 2 to 10 kev ) , near - ir and mid - ir observations ( e.g.  turner et al , 1997 , risaliti , maiolino and salvati , 1999 , alonso - herrero , ward , kotilainen , 1997 and clavel et al , 2000 ) showing that seyfert 2s are generally characterised by strong absorption whilst seyfert 1 galaxies are relatively unabsorbed .",
    "heisler , lumsden and bailey ( 1997 , hereafter hlb ) performed an optical spectropolarimetric study of a well defined and statistically complete iras 60@xmath4 m selected seyfert 2 sample to determine the statistical detectability of polarised broad lines .",
    "the objects were selected at 60@xmath4 m to reduce the possibility of biasing due to torus inclination / extinction effects and all objects were observed to the same signal to noise to ensure similar detection thresholds . in this study a striking relationship between the detectability of polarised broad h@xmath0 and the iras @xmath1 flux ratio was found where only those galaxies with warm iras colours ( @xmath54.0 ) showed a hidden broad line region ( hblr ) .",
    "both seyfert 2 galaxy types were found to be well matched in terms of redshift , overall polarisation and detection rate of compact nuclear radio emission .",
    "therefore , without any apparent contradictory evidence , hlb suggested that the iras @xmath1 ratio provides a measure of the inclination of the torus to the line of sight : in a cool seyfert 2 the torus is so highly inclined that even the broad line scattering screen is obscured .",
    "i present here hx evidence that suggests this picture is incorrect and provide a new view that is consistent with other observations .",
    "the picture presented by hlb appears reasonable . assuming that the seyfert torus is optically thick at mid - ir wavelengths ( e.g. pier and krolik , 1993 , granato and danese , 1994 , efstathiou and rowan - robinson , 1995 ) the mid - ir to far - ir flux ratio should vary depending upon the inclination of the torus to the line of sight .",
    "a simple prediction of this picture is that seyfert 1 galaxies should show warmer colours than seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the mean iras @xmath1 flux ratios of seyfert galaxies from the iras 60@xmath4 m selected bright galaxy sample ( bgs , soifer et al , 1989 ) , as classified by kim et al ( 1995 ) and using data from the literature ( see section 3 ) are 7.1@xmath62.9 and 7.6@xmath63.2 for seyfert 1s and 2s respectively .",
    "the seyfert 1s do not statistically show warmer colours in this sample .",
    "however , it could be argued that these ratios are biased by differences in the star formation between seyfert 1s and 2s or optical depth effects in the seyfert 2 nuclei , biasing the ratio towards warm objects . in any case",
    "the most direct test of the inclination picture is made with hx observations .",
    "one of the key supports of the unified model comes from hx observations where the nuclear extinction is directly determined from the observed spectral slope .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies are characterised by little or no absorption 20@xmath7log(@xmath8)@xmath721 @xmath9 whilst seyfert 2s have significant , sometimes extreme , absorption 22@xmath7log(@xmath8)@xmath725 @xmath9 ( e.g.  turner et al , 1997 and risaliti , maiolino and salvati , 1999 ) .",
    "although the hx properties of seyferts are too poorly known to allow a detailed measure of the torus inclination , as the cool seyfert 2s are more highly inclined than the warm seyfert 2s in the hlb interpretation , they should statistically show higher column densities . to date 13 of the galaxies in the hlb sample",
    "have been observed with either bepposax or asca .",
    "the other 3 objects have been observed by einstien or in the heao1/a survey . in the case of the heao1/a objects",
    "only upper limits could be placed .",
    "for these two galaxies ( ngc34 and ngc1143 ) i have used the upper limits and unextincted [ oiii]@xmath105007 emission line fluxes to predict their nuclear extinction using the diagnostic diagram of bassani et al ( 1999 ) .",

    "( a ) bassani et al , 1999 , ( b ) pappa , georgantopoulos and stewart , 1999 , ( c ) risalti , maiolino and salvati , 1999 , ( d ) polletta et al , 1996 , ( e ) kruper , urry and canziares , 1990 _    the derived column densities show that an optically thick structure exists in both the warm and cool seyfert 2 galaxy types , with the notable exception of ngc7590 which may be a seyfert 1 with galactic dust obscuring the blr , however , signficantly there is very little difference in the distribution of column densities .",
    "the overall distribution is similar to that found for the [ oiii]@xmath105007 selected seyfert sample of risaliti , maiolino and salvati ( 1999 ) suggesting that the far - ir selects seyferts in a reasonably unbiased manner : @xmath2635% of the objects are compton thick ( i.e. log(@xmath27 @xmath9 ) , the mean log(@xmath8 ) for the whole sample is 23.2@xmath60.9 @xmath9 and the mean for the warm and cool seyfert 2s are 23.7@xmath60.5 @xmath9 and 22.9@xmath61.0 @xmath9 ( 23.1@xmath60.7 @xmath9 if ngc7590 is excluded ) respectively .",
    "the hypothesis of hlb could still be retained if the cool seyfert 2s are compton thick and the determined column densities refer to the extinction suffered by the scattered emission , however , the mean log([oiii]/hx ) of 0.3@xmath61.0 and -0.2@xmath61.4 for the warm and cool seyfert 2s respectively suggest that this is not the case ( see bassani et al , 1999 ) .",
    "therefore the most direct conclusion to make from this hx analysis is that the iras @xmath1 flux ratio does not indicate the inclination angle of the torus in seyfert 2s .",
    "if the iras @xmath1 colour ratio is not an indicator of the inclination of the dusty torus , what does this colour ratio imply ?",
    "a natural starting point is to compare the hlb seyfert properties to those of non - seyfert galaxies .",
    "a good comparison is the bgs sample which is selected at the same wavelength as the hlb sample ( 60@xmath4 m ) and has a very similar flux limit . the bgs sample is partially classified by kim et al ( 1995 ) using the optical emission line ratio technique ( e.g. baldwin , phillips and terlevich , 1981 ) . to increase the number of classified objects i have taken these observations and other optical spectroscopic observations from the literature , classifying 77% of the bgs sample , see table 2 .",
    "these galaxies have been classified using the emission line diagnostics of veilleux and osterbrock ( 1987 ) and the mode classification for each galaxy is adopted . for brevity only the [ nii]@xmath106583/h@xmath0 vs [",

    "cccc + hii & liners & agn & no emission lines +   + 62% & 25% & 12% & 1% +   +      a logical first step is to compare the iras colours , see figure 3 .",
    "the ir warm region is clearly dominated by seyfert 2s although the cool region also contains hii and liner galaxies with a wide range of iras colours .",
    "the cool seyfert 2s can not be distinguished from the hii and liner galaxies in terms of their iras emission ( note there are no seyfert 2s with log(@xmath290.9 due to the hlb selection criteria ) .",
    "the distribution of hx derived nuclear column densities suggest an optically thick structure ( i.e.  the torus ) exists in both seyfert 2 galaxy types which , according to the unified model , should emit thermally at ir wavelengths . therefore , although the hx emission shows that a seyfert nucleus is present in the cool seyfert 2s , the ir emission from the torus must be dominated by galactic emission in the large iras apertures ( as previously suggested by alexander et al , 1999 ) .",
    "additional evidence for this picture is found in the distribution of optical emission line ratios where the cool seyfert 2s have , on average , weaker [ oiii]/h@xmath28 emission , see figure 2 . assuming that both the warm and cool seyfert 2s have the same basic seyfert nucleus and galactic emission , the lower mean emission line ratio in the cool seyfert 2s implies a larger ratio of galactic to seyfert activity .",
    "indeed in one galaxy ( ngc7496 ) the observed emission line ratio is consistent with that of an hii galaxy even though it clearly has hx emission and therefore a seyfert nucleus .",
    "hii galaxies produce mid - ir pah emission ( see puget and leger , 1989 ) whilst pure seyfert nuclei do not . therefore in the above scenario the pah equivalent width should vary based on the iras @xmath1 colour ratio .",
    "indeed lutz et al ( 1998 ) found that this occurs in the extremely luminous object class of ulirgs although this test has not been performed for seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "unfortunately suitable mid - ir observations are not available for the complete hlb sample although seyfert 2 observations from clavel et al ( 2000 ) and hii galaxy observations from rigopoulou et al ( 1999 ) provide the general picture , see figure 4 .",
    "the distribution of pah emission is reasonably well segregated with the cool seyfert 2s occupying a similar region to the hii galaxies although there is not a tight correlation .",
    "this may be because the galactic emission can be a combination of both galactic cirrus emission , which show strong pah features , and more intense star formation emission , which show weak pah features ( e.g.  laurent et al , 1999 ) .",
    "the cool seyfert 2s have iras colours , optical emission line ratios and pah emission suggestive of a weak seyfert nucleus and a dominant galactic component . can the spectropolarimetric results be explained in the same way ?      as the [ oiii]@xmath105007 emission line is a good indicator of the strength of the seyfert nucleus ( e.g. alonoso - herrero et al , 1997 , bassani et al , 1999 ) it should be possible to estimate the strength of polarised broad h@xmath0 in the cool seyfert 2s . indeed the [ oiii]@xmath105007 emission line flux , corrected for galactic extinction and then re - extincted to the wavelength of h@xmath0 to simulate the probable extinction suffered by the h@xmath0 emission , shows a good correlation with polarised broad h@xmath0 flux , see figure 5 and table 1 . in general the predicted fluxes of the cool seyfert 2s are a factor @xmath263 lower than the warm seyfert 2s and in many cases fall below that easily obtainable on a 4 metre telescope . in two cases",
    "the predicted fluxes are similar to those found for warm seyfert 2s and in one of these objects ( ngc7582 ) broad h@xmath0 has been directly observed ( aretxaga et al , 1999 ) .",
    "however , in determining the detectability of polarised broad h@xmath0 there is another factor to consider as the galaxies were observed to the same signal to noise and therefore the detectability of a hblr also depends on the optical brightness of the galaxy . the mean optical ( v band ) magnitudes are 12.1@xmath62.4 and 12.4@xmath61.4 for the warm and cool seyfert 2s respectively , showing that there is no statistical difference in their overall optical brightnesses .",
    "therefore as the polarised broad h@xmath0 fluxes are lower in the cool seyfert 2s , whilst the overall fluxes are not , the sensitivity to polarised broad h@xmath0 should be worse by a factor of @xmath263 in the cool seyfert 2s .",
    "these two factors can account for the lack of detected hblrs in the cool seyfert 2s and agree with the overall hypothesis that the differences between the seyfert 2 galaxy types are that the cool seyfert 2s have a weak seyfert nucleus and a dominant galactic component .",
    "the weaker seyfert emission in the cool seyfert 2s should lead to a lower observed polarisation , however , hlb claim no statistical difference between the seyfert 2 galaxy types .",
    "this apparent inconsistency can be reconciled as there is another component to the observed polarisation : galactic polarisation .",
    "galactic polarisation is proportional to the measured galactic extinction ( serkowski , mathewson and ford , 1975 and scarrott , 1996 ) and as the cool seyfert 2s have a higher galactic extinction ( i.e. as measured by the h@xmath0/h@xmath28 emission line ratio ( ward et al , 1987 ) , see hlb and table 1 ) they should also have a larger galactic polarisation component .    an obvious question to raise",
    "is why do the cool seyfert 2s have a higher galactic extinction ?",
    "a natural explanation for this would be that the galactic disc is more highly inclined in the cool objects , however the mean inclinations ( measured from dss images ) of 43@xmath630 and 42@xmath625 degrees for the warm and cool seyfert 2 galaxies respectively show that this is not the case .",
    "therefore there must be another component contributing to the higher extinction in the cool seyfert 2s .",
    "analysis of dss images of the hlb sample suggest that cool seyfert 2s are more likely to have nuclear dust lanes .",
    "dust lanes are known to be very efficient at causing galactic polarisation ( see centaurus a , hough et al , 1987 ) and would also account for the higher galactic extinction in the cool seyfert 2s .",
    "high resolution images of the hlb sample are required to test this scenario .",
    "hlb showed a dichotomy in the detectability of polarised broad h@xmath0 in seyfert 2 galaxies where only those objects with warm iras colours showed polarised broad line emission .",
    "they suggested that those seyfert 2s with cool iras colours had highly inclined tori which obscured the broad line scattering screen .",
    "i have presented evidence against this picture and suggested that the ir dichotomy is due to the relative strength of galactic to seyfert emission .",
    "the main results of this study are :    \\(i ) the hard x - ray derived column densities of the warm and cool seyfert 2s are statistically the same and therefore the iras @xmath1 flux ratio can not imply the inclination of the torus in the standard unified model .",
    "\\(ii ) the cool seyfert 2s have iras colours and pah emission similar to hii galaxies and optical nuclear emission line ratios consistent with a mixture of seyfert and galactic activity . as the hard x - ray observations suggest",
    "that both seyfert 2 galaxy types have similar nuclear properties , the differences in the iras @xmath1 flux ratios are most probably due to a weaker seyfert component and a more dominant galactic component in the cool seyfert 2s .",
    "\\(iii ) the difference in the detectability of polarised broad h@xmath0 is most probably due to a larger component of optical starlight in the cool seyfert 2s .",
    "the reason for the lack of difference in observed polarisation between both seyfert 2 types is probably due to a larger galactic polarisation component in the cool galaxies caused by their larger galactic extinction .",
