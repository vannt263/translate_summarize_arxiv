    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf ( wd ) and a red - dwarf secondary transferring matter via the roche - lobe overflow [ for reviews , see @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are a class of cvs characterized by the presence of outbursts , which are generally believed to be a result of thermal instabilities in the accretion disk .",
    "dwarf novae are classified into three major classes : ss cyg - type , z cam - type and su uma - type dwarf novae . among them",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae show superhumps during their long - lasting superoutbursts .",
    "the superhumps are generally believed to arise from the precessing eccentric accretion disk whose eccentricity is excited by the 3:1 resonance @xcite .    according to the standard scenario of cv evolution , cvs with orbital periods ( @xmath2 ) longer than @xmath33 hr evolve towards shorter @xmath2 through the loss of angular momentum by magnetic braking ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and gravitational wave radiation .",
    "when the systems reach certain periods around @xmath4 hr , the secondary becomes fully convective and the effect of the magnetic braking is believed to decrease dramatically , followed by the shrinkage of the secondary and reduction of the cv activity .",
    "this state lasts till the secondary again fills the roche lobe at around @xmath5 hr and forms the famous `` period gap '' in the @xmath2 distribution of cvs . after crossing the period gap",
    ", @xmath2 further decreases mainly through the loss of angular momentum by gravitational wave radiation until the secondary becomes degenerate . around the time when this point is reached",
    ", the @xmath2 increases due to two reasons : the thermal time - scale of the secondary exceeds the mass - transfer time - scale and the mass - radius relation is reversed for degenerate dwarfs .",
    "this mechanism leads to the existence of the minimum period for ordinary cvs @xcite .",
    "those systems whose periods go past the period minimum are usually called period bouncers .",
    "the early model calculations yielded the minimum period of 6080 min ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "later refined models yielded short periods of 6570 min ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is significantly shorter than the observed value ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this disagreement is called `` period minimum problem '' .",
    "furthermore , population synthesis studies expect that most systems have already reached the period minimum and that there is a heavy accumulation of systems around the period minimum ( period spike ) .",
    "since such a spike was not observationally evident until very recently , this disagreement was called `` period spike problem '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observational evidence for the period spike has only recently been shown ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some of non - magnetic cvs above the period gap and most of cvs below the period gap exhibit dwarf nova - type outbursts .",
    "in addition to color - based surveys such as palomer green ( pg ) survey @xcite and hamburg quasar survey ( hqs ; @xcite ) , and color - selected spectroscopic survey such as sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , dwarf nova - type outbursts have been both traditionally , and in modern times , playing an important role in discovering cvs .    in variability - based surveys of cvs ,",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae are a particularly important group for two reasons : ( 1 ) su uma - type dwarf novae show superhumps and we can estimate the orbital periods using only photometric observations . ( 2 ) most of dwarf novae below the period gap are su uma - type dwarf novae , and wz sge - type dwarf novae ( a subgroup of su uma - type dwarf novae ; cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) are considered to occupy the terminal stage of the cv evolution .",
    "the recent increase in discoveries of new su uma - type dwarf novae , helped by massive transient surveys such as catalina real - time survey ( crts , @xcite)http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu / catalina/@xmath6 . for the information of the individual catalina cvs , see @xmath7http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu / catalina / allcv.html@xmath6 .",
    "] , the all sku automated survey-3 ( asas-3 , @xcite ) and by amateur observers ( notably k. itagaki ) , have a significant impact on the distribution of orbital periods in cvs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "both works have indicated that the period minimum spike , which has only become observationally apparent , are heavily composed of newly identified su uma - type dwarf novae or faint sdss cvs . using bayesian statistical analysis",
    ", @xcite suggested a possibility that the true period minimum is even shorter than what is observed , considering the effect of low detectability of very low mass - transfer systems .    these surveys and statistics ,",
    "however , unavoidably suffer from various kinds of biases .",
    "there are a bias because essentially all surveys are magnitude - limited , with bias being introduced by color selection criteria , and bias resulting from follow - up strategies .",
    "the first two biases are more serious in color and spectroscopy - selected searches .",
    "the last bias is more important in variability - based searches , because long-@xmath2 ss cyg and z cam - type dwarf novae do not show superhumps , and short-@xmath2 su uma - type ones show such @xmath2 as are more easily determined .",
    "furthermore , it is known that large - amplitude dwarf novae tend to receive popular attention , potentially leading to a bias toward detecting a larger number of shorter-@xmath2 systems .",
    "estimating @xmath2 from colors of dwarf novae in quiescence , if it is feasible , could reduce the effect of the last bias .",
    "there has been a long history of using colors in classifying cvs : @xcite compiled @xmath8 colors of cvs and tried to classify them on the color - color diagram and @xcite extended this work .",
    "@xcite used @xmath9 photometry and spectroscopy to characterize quiescent dwarf novae .",
    "@xcite showed that ( @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath11 ) colors become bluer in shorter-@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite used ( @xmath12 ) color to characterize the secondary and cv type .",
    "@xcite complied 2mass colors of cvs and extended the results by @xcite .",
    "@xcite closely examined 2mass color to characterize dwarf novae .",
    "@xcite further used 2mass color to estimate absolute magnitudes of cvs and derived space distributions @xcite .",
    "@xcite used sdss color cuts , uv color and variability for detecting new dwarf novae .    in this study , we used the sdss photometric catalog for exploring a new way to estimate @xmath2 , and we discuss the implication of the resultant period distribution .",
    "the sample we used are the known dwarf novae in the general catalog of variable stars ( gcvs , @xcite ) , downes cv catalog , archival edition @xcite , the online version of rkcat [ @xcite , ( update rkcat7.15 , 2011 ) ] , sdss cvs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , newly recognized dwarf novae by crts , crts mount lemmon survey ( mls)http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu / mls / allcv.html@xmath6 .",

    "most of dwarf novae were easily recognized based on their light curves ( typical dwarf nova - type light curve and existence of past outbursts ) .",
    "some crts dwarf novae were selected based on single outburst detections and typical cv colors in quiescence .",
    "for sdss cvs , we selected objects that are recognized as dwarf novae based on the presence of outbursts and objects that have dwarf nova - type spectra .",
    "we rejected sdss magnitudes measured during outbursts or standstills ( in z cam - type dwarf novae ) by comparing with other photometric catalogs , known ranges of variability and typical quiescent magnitudes in the crts data .",
    "if there are two or measurements in sdss and their magnitudes differ by more than 1 mag , we rejected the measurements whose magnitudes are brighter by more than 1 mag than the faintest one in order to minimize the contamination of outbursts .",
    "even if multiple sdss entries are present for the same object , we used the measurements individually and did not use an averaged value of each object before analysis .",
    "we rejected measurements that have saturated pixels ( shown as blanks in table [ tab : dnlist ] ) .    for estimating galactic extinction",
    ", we used @xcite for a through - the - galaxy estimate , and obtained the extinction at the distance of the object using @xcite assuming a scale height of @xmath13 pc for the interstellar dust ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we employed an iterative process to obtain self - consistent estimates of distance and extinction .",
    "we examined the dependence of the results on the assumption of @xmath14 , using extreme set of @xmath15 pc ( typical value for molecular coulds ) and @xmath16 pc ( typical value for cold neutral medium ) .",
    "the resultant periods of neural network analysis ( section [ sec : nnet ] ) varied within 5 % of the @xmath13 pc result for 68 % of objects .",
    "we used distance estimates tabulated in @xcite and those of @xcite for gp com , @xcite for gk per and @xcite for gd 552 .",
    "for estimating the distance of the rest of the objects , we used warner s relations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if apparent magnitudes of maximum are available we estimated the distances by assuming the absolute magnitudes ( @xmath17 ) using the updated warner s relation @xcite for objects with @xmath18 d , and our own calibration based on gk per [ the interstellar extinction correction of @xmath19 was taken from @xcite ] for longer @xmath2 :          assuming @xmath22=2.5 to estimate minimum @xmath23 and estimated observed apparent magnitudes of minimum to the distances .",
    "when the orbital periods were not available , we used the results of a neural network analysis ( section [ sec : nnet ] ) .",
    "we used a mean maximum @xmath24 for objects without measured and estimated orbital periods .",
    "since warner s relation for the maximum is not very sensitive to the orbital period , the uncertainty introduced by the uncertainty of the orbital period is estimated to be sufficiently small .",
    "we used the coefficients in @xcite to convert @xmath25-band absorption @xmath26 to extinctions in sdss passbands .",
    "since the application of warner s relation requires orbital periods , the estimation of galactic extinction is dependent on the results of the neural network analysis for objects without known orbital periods .",
    "we therefore repeated this process three times , using the results of the neural network analysis for estimating the distances , to obtain self - consistent estimates of distances and orbital periods from de - reddened colors .",
    "these values and the methods of estimation are placed in a later table ( table [ tab : dnlist2 ] ) in order to save space ."
