    "performing this measurement within a few years requires very intense , continuous muon beams , which are provided by the high - intensity proton accelerator at the paul scherrer institute ( psi ) in switzerland .",
    "muon stop rates in excess of @xmath5 per second are currently available .",
    "a future high - intensity muon beam ( himb ) capturing muons produced in the spallation target of the swiss neutron source ( sinq ) would push this beyond the @xmath6 per second required to reach @xmath1 in branching fraction sensitivity . running at rates of several",
    "billion muon decays per second and at the same time being able to suppress backgrounds by 16 orders of magnitude and being efficient for the signal is a formidable challenge for the detection system .",
    "@xmath3signal events are constituted by an electron and two positron tracks with a common vertex and coincident in time .",
    "as they originate from a muon decay at rest , the vectorial sum of their momenta should vanish and their energies should add up to the muon mass .",
    "the maximum momentum is @xmath7  mev/@xmath8 .",
    "there are two main categories of background , on one hand accidental coincidences of positrons from ordinary muon decays with an electron from e.g.  photon conversion , bhabha scattering or mis - reconstruction of positrons curling back in the magnetic field .",
    "accidental backgrounds can be suppressed by excellent vertex , timing and momentum resolution . on the other hand",
    "there is the background due to the _ internal conversion _ muon decay @xmath9 , which looks exactly like the signal decay , except that the neutrinos carry away some energy and momentum . from the branching fraction as a function of missing energy ,",
    "the overall energy resolution required for a given sensitivity can be derived , see fig .",
    "[ fig : icontamination ] .        in summary , the mu3e detector must provide excellent vertex and timing resolution as well as an average momentum resolution better than @xmath10  mev/@xmath8 with a large geometrical acceptance and at the same time be capable of standing @xmath11 muon decays per second .",
    "a momentum measurement can be performed by measuring a direction ( e.g.  with a double layer of detectors ) and a third point with some lever arm to determine the curvature in the magnetic field .",
    "for the low momentum electrons in mu3e , multiple coulomb scattering ( with expected scattering angle @xmath12 ) and the lever arm @xmath13 are the dominating quantities affecting the resolution , to first order @xmath14 see fig .",
    "[ fig : ms]a . for good momentum resolution",
    "it is thus imperative to have a minimum amount of material , which determines the detector technology as described in section [ sec : maps ] and a large lever arm ( ideally close to a semi - circle of the track , where multiple scattering effects cancel to first order , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ms]b ) , which determines the detector geometry , section [ sec : det ] .",
    "for mu3e , minimizing the material within the acceptance is crucial .",
    "gas detectors however can not stand the required rates due to ageing or occupancy ( wire chambers ) or do not deliver the required precision due to space charge effects ( time - projection chambers , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "solid state detectors until recently were either too thick ( hybrid systems ) or too slow ( monolithic active pixel sensors , maps ) for the task at hand .",
    "the high - voltage maps technology @xcite offers a way out of this dilemma by providing sensors that can be thinned to below 50  m thickness and ran at frame rates above 10  mhz due to fast charge collection and built - in zero - suppression .    the mupix series of hv - maps are fabricated in a commercial process ( ams 180  nm hv - cmos ) and apply voltages of 50 - 100  v between the substrate and the deep @xmath15-wells containing the active electronics ( see fig .  [ fig : hv_cmos_pixel_sketch ] for a schematic drawing ) , leading to the fast charge collection via drift from a thin active depletion zone . the mupix 2 prototype with @xmath16 pixels of @xmath17  m@xmath18 size was characterized extensively during 2012 @xcite .",
    "the chips implement a charge sensitive amplifier and a source follower inside the pixels and a comparator plus digital electronics in the chip periphery .",
    "the signal size is measured via the time - over - threshold method . for drift voltages above @xmath19  v signal amplification is observed , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tot_latency ] , left .",
    "the use of led flashes to generate signals allows for latency measurements between the flash and the appearance of the signal at the comparator exit .",
    "these latencies are of the order of 0.5  s , dominated by the shaping time and improving with high voltage , see fig .  [",
    "fig : tot_latency ] , right .",
    "the noise of the sensor was estimated using the sharpness of the threshold for a known injection signal and the signal size estimated using a @xmath20fe radioactive source , giving signal - to - noise - ratios well above 20 .",
    "the mupix 3 chip currently under study includes additional digital column logic and encodes hit information encompassing row and column address and a timestamp .",
    "also the pixels are now @xmath21  m@xmath18 in size , close to the @xmath22  m@xmath18 required for the production of @xmath23 and @xmath24  cm@xmath18 sensors , which will also include digital logic serializing the hit information on chip and sending it out via up to four 800  mbit / s low - voltage differential signalling links .",
    "the mupix chips will be glued and bonded to kapton  flex - prints with aluminium traces for signals and power . these flex - prints in turn are glued to a kapton  prism serving as a mechanical support . a complete layer with 50  m silicon and twice 25",
    "m kapton  plus aluminium and adhesive is less than a permille of a radiation length thick .",
    "prototypes of this mechanical structure using glass plates instead of the silicon have been produced and were found to be surprisingly sturdy ( and self - supporting ) , see fig .",

    "the mu3e tracking detector should be sensitive for a transverse momentum range from 12 to 53  mev/@xmath8 and provide a momentum resolution of better than 0.5  mev/@xmath8 over the same range . moving the detectors to large radii in order to have a large lever arm for high transverse momentum tracks sacrifices acceptance at low momenta ( fig .",

    "the outer pixel layers and their extension in forward and backward direction allow for precise momentum measurement with re - curling tracks .",
    "inside of the forward and backward extensions , scintillating tiles perform a timing measurement with a resolution better than 100  ps .",
    "this overall arrangement of detectors leads to a minimum disturbance of the momentum ( and vertex ) measurement by the timing detectors , as the main contribution to the momentum resolution comes from the free space curl outside of the detector tube .",
    "another advantage of this design is the modularity , which allows for a staged approach in step with increasing muon rates .",
    "phase ia _ detector will consist of only the inner and outer central pixel detectors , sufficient for muon rates of a few 10@xmath27/s .",

    "the detector performance is studied both using a geant4 @xcite based simulation with a detailed description of materials and the magnetic field as well as a simplified model mainly for reconstruction studies assuming perfectly cylindrical tracking layers .",
    "a three - dimensional multiple scattering track fit ignoring detector resolution is employed for track finding .",
    "it is planned to employ a general broken line fit @xcite in a second step in order to obtain the best possible resolution .",
    "the results presented in the following were obtained with a simplified model and a multiple scattering dominated fit . fig .",
    "[ fig : michelreso ] shows the momentum resolution for tracks from ordinary muon decays with an rms of 280  kev/@xmath8 .",
    "the resolution for the invariant mass of the three decay particles is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massreso ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : smearplot ] finally shows the ability of the presented detection system for separating the @xmath3signal from the @xmath9background .",
    "the mu3e tracking detector employs a variety of innovative techniques in order to obtain the best possible momentum resolution in a multiple scattering dominated environment , namely :    * hv - maps sensors thinned to 50  m thickness ; * a mechanical structure built from 25  m kapton  foil and a 25  m kapton  flexprint , leading to a layer thickness of less than a permille of a radiation length ; * cooling with gaseous helium in order not to add material ; * the use of recurling tracks for increasing the lever arm for momentum measurements .",
    "the combination of these techniques achieves a three particle invariant mass resolution in the order of 0.5  mev/@xmath31 , thus fulfilling the requirements of the mu3e experiment for reaching @xmath1 in branching ratio sensitivity for the decay @xmath3 .",
