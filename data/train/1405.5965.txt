    "the most advanced quantum information technology is quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , which is the art of using quantum properties to distribute a secure key between two remote parties .",
    "its challenge lies in the combination of state of the art experimental implementations and newly developed quantum information theoretic principles to ensure its security .",
    "there exist two different implementations both of which have different benefits .",
    "more established is the encoding of the information in a quantum system with discrete degrees of freedoms , as , e.g. , the polarization of a photon .",
    "such discrete variable protocols are usually based on single photon sources and detectors with the latter suffer from low efficiency at room temperature and being susceptible to loopholes ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of such protocols is that conditioned on the arrival of a single photon , the channel noise is generally weaker allowing for long distances .",
    "an alternative implementation encodes the information into the quadratures of the electromagnetic field ( see the recent review  @xcite and references therein ) . since the quadratures have a continuous spectrum they are called continuous variable qkd protocols .",
    "compared to discrete variable protocols , they are based on variants of homodyne detection which is a robust and efficient measurement technique already used in current telecommunication systems .",
    "although cv qkd systems are secure against blinding attacks , they are particularly vulnerable to manipulations of the phase reference signal ( local oscillater ) ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "since the information is directly encoded in the phase and amplitude of the laser beam , the fiber losses severely damp the transmitted signal and with that the encoded information .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown in  @xcite that a key can be generated for arbitrary losses using reverse reconciliation protocols .",
    "this has recently also been experimentally demonstrated against restricted attacks  @xcite .",
    "up to recently , the security of continuous variable qkd protocols has only been analyzed in the asymptotic limit assuming an infinite number of communication rounds ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "for protocols based on a gaussian phase and amplitude modulation this simplifies the security analysis tremendously .",
    "for instance , so - called collective attacks in which each signal is attacked independently and identically are as powerful as general ( coherent ) attacks  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that gaussian collective attacks are optimal among all collective attacks  @xcite . but these powerful results can no longer be applied if finite - size effects due to only a finite number of communication rounds are considered . and furthermore , even under a restricted set of collective gaussian attacks a significantly lower key rate is obtained for feasible block lengths  @xcite .",
    "a big challenge in continuous variable qkd is to prove security against coherent attacks including all finite - size effects .",
    "since the hilbert space of the system is infinite - dimensional certain techniques that are standard for discrete variable security proofs can not be applied .",
    "for instance , the exponential quantum de - finetti theorem  @xcite or the post - selection technique  @xcite that are used to lift security against collective attacks to security against coherent attacks do not directly apply in infinite dimensions ( c.f .",
    "recently , the post - selection technique has been extended in order to apply it to continuous variable qkd  @xcite , but its practical implementation relies on a cumbersome symmetry step which is unpractical for real life applications .",
    "another promising approach has been presented in  @xcite which is based on a newly extended uncertainty relation including the effect of entangled observers  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding protocol is based on the distribution of entangled two - mode squeezed states and homodyne detection implemented in  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty relation allows to bound the information of an eavesdropper eve solely by the correlation strength between the honest parties alice and bob .",
    "it has thus the advantage that no tomography , or equivalently , quantum channel estimations are necessary with the consequence of not relying on collective attacks .",
    "but in  @xcite only losses up to @xmath1% could be tolerated since a direct reconciliation protocol has been used .",
    "moreover , the potential and limitations of the proof technique have not been fully investigated .    here",
    ", we show that using a reverse reconciliation protocol significantly higher losses of over @xmath2% can be tolerated enabling transmission distances of over @xmath0 km including finite - size effects .",
    "this makes the protocol suitable for practical short distance continuous variable qkd providing security against coherent attacks .",
    "the security proof has the advantage that it does not require any assumptions on alice s measurement device and is thus one - sided device independent .",
    "compared to  @xcite , the reverse reconciliation protocol requires bob to apply a test to control the energy of the incoming signal .",
    "the test is based on a beam splitter to reflect a negligible part of the signal which is then measured with a heterodyne detector .",
    "we then show that conditioned that the outcomes of the heterodyne detector are sufficiently small the probability of eve using a large energy attack can be neglected .",
    "this test further allows one to overcome the problem that homodyne detectors only operate faithfully in a limited detection range .",
    "moreover , we provide a new statistical estimation procedure that enables us to deal with high energy signals which was not possible in  @xcite .",
    "we also clarify the theoretical limitations of the proof technique based on the extended uncertainty relation .",
    "in particular , we provide the optimal key rate in the asymptotic limit of an infinite number of exchanged signals and without statistical uncertainty .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that even under these ideal conditions the tolerated losses are limited .",
    "an investigation of the asymptotic key rate for a broad range of continuous variable protocols based on the uncertainty relation has recently been given in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section  [ sec : keyrate ] by introducing the security definitions and the classical part of the protocol .",
    "this enables us to give a general formula for the key rate presented in  . in section  [ sec : setup ]",
    ", we discuss the experimental setup and how the raw key is formed .",
    "the different steps of the protocol are then listed in section  [ sec : protocol ] together with the assumptions .",
    "the main result is theorem  [ thm : keylength ] which gives the explicit formula for the key length . in section  [ sec : keyrates ]",
    ", we present plots of the key rates for experimentally feasible parameters .",
    "the security analysis is given in section  [ sec : secanalysis ] .",
    "the tightness of the security proof is analyzed in section  [ sec : tightness ] .",
    "eventually , we conclude our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "a generic qkd protocol consists of two phases .",
    "the first phase is given by the quantum part and includes the transmission and measurement of the quantum system .",
    "the second phase is purely classical and consists of the extraction of a secure key from the measured data by means of classical post - processing . in the following ,",
    "we consider an entanglement based scenario in which the source is trusted and located in alice s laboratory .",
    "she then sends one part of the quantum system through a quantum channel to bob .",
    "it is always understood that alice s and bob s laboratory s are closed , that is , no unwanted information can leak to an eavesdropper .",
    "once all quantum systems are distributed , alice and bob perform measurements to obtain the data from which the raw keys @xmath3 and @xmath4 are formed . at the same time a parameter estimation test is done which concludes whether one proceeds with the key extraction or one aborts the protocol .",
    "since the key generation is a statistical process , one can assign a probability @xmath5 to the event that the parameter test is passed .",
    "given that the parameter estimation test is passed , alice and bob proceed with the classical post processing to generate the final keys @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are classical random variables which might be correlated with a quantum system @xmath8 hold by an eavesdropper .",
    "we denote the associated classical - quantum state by @xmath9 .",
    "the state @xmath9 can conveniently be written as a classical quantum state @xmath10 where the classical values for the keys @xmath11 and @xmath12 are associated with orthonormal states @xmath13 in a hilbert space . here",
    ", @xmath14 denotes the distribution of keys and @xmath15 the quantum state of the eavesdropper conditioned on @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we characterize a quantum key distribution protocol by its correctness and secrecy . for",
    "that we use a notion of security which is composable and based on the approach developed in  @xcite . a protocol is called @xmath18__-correct _ _ if the probability that @xmath6 is not equal to @xmath7 is smaller than @xmath18 : @xmath19 \\leq \\epsilon_c \\ , .\\ ] ] roughly speaking , a protocol is secret if the key @xmath7 is almost uniformly distributed and completely uncorrelated to eve s system @xmath8 . the ideal state is thus given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the uniform distribution over all keys and @xmath22 is the reduction of the state   to system @xmath8 .",
    "we then say that a protocol is @xmath23__-secret _ _ if @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the trace norm and the infimum is taken over all possible states of eve s system .",
    "eventually , a protocol is called @xmath26__-secure _ _ if it is @xmath18-correct and @xmath23-secret with @xmath27 .",
    "note that the above security definition is composable in the sense that security is guaranteed if any part of the key is used for any other cryptographic protocol .",
    "this follows from the monotonicity of the trace distance .      as discussed in the previous section",
    ", the classical post - processing transforms the raw keys @xmath3 and @xmath4 into the final keys @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the first step of this post - processing an information reconciliation protocol",
    "is applied to diminish the discrepancy of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that it is beneficial for continuous variable qkd protocols to use a reverse reconciliation scheme in which alice corrects her raw key @xmath3 in order to match @xmath4 .",
    "this is especially crucial for long distance qkd . throughout this paper , we assume that a one - way reverse reconciliation protocol is used in which @xmath28 bits of information about @xmath4 is sent to alice via an authenticated classical channel . given this information and @xmath3 , alice outputs a guess @xmath29 of @xmath4 .    in order to ensure correctness   for the raw keys @xmath30 and @xmath4 ( and thus for the keys )",
    ", bob applies a random function of a family of two - universal hash functions  @xcite onto an alphabet of size @xmath31 on @xmath4 .",
    "he then sends alice over an authenticated public channel a description of the applied function together with the obtained value .",
    "this leaks additional @xmath32 bits of information , where the logarithm is always taken to base @xmath33 .",
    "alice applies the function to her corrected raw key @xmath29 and checks if the obtained value matches with the one from bob .",
    "if this is the case , they proceed with the protocol otherwise they abort  .",
    "this then ensures that the generated key is @xmath18 correct .    in a second step of the classical post -",
    "processing the raw key is hashed to a sufficiently small alphabet by means of a family of two - universal hash functions such that the key is @xmath34-secure .",
    "let us assume that the output of the hash functions is a bit string of length @xmath35 . for finite - dimensional @xmath8 systems it has been shown in  @xcite that the length of the bit string @xmath35 can be expressed by the smooth min - entropy @xmath36 which is related to the maximal probability that eve guesses @xmath4 correctly ( see section  [ sec : ur ] ) .",
    "this result has been extended in  @xcite to the case where eve s system e is modeled by an infinite - dimensional hilbert space , which is necessary for applications to continuous variable systems .",
    "in particular , it holds that if @xmath37 , @xmath38 is a tight lower bound on the key length @xmath35 with @xmath39 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the state @xmath40 for which the smooth min - entropy is evaluated corresponds to the classical - quantum state describing the joint state of bob s raw key @xmath4 and eve s system @xmath8 conditioned that the protocol passes .",
    "the goal of the security analysis is to obtain a tight lower bound on   using the data collected in the parameter estimation step .",
    "the protocol is similar to the one in  @xcite and consists of the distribution of an entangled two - mode squeezed state and homodyne detection first proposed in  @xcite .",
    "but additionally , bob performs a test in order to estimate whether the incoming signal exceeds a certain energy threshold .",
    "this test allows one to exclude high energy eavesdropping attacks and to restrict onto a bounded measurement range .",
    "this is crucial in order to do finite statistics with reliable error bounds .",
    "the test requires only two additional homodyne detectors .",
    "the source is assumed to be in alice s laboratory and generates a two - mode squeezed entangled state often referred to as an epr state .",
    "this can be implemented by mixing two squeezed modes over a balanced beam splitter  @xcite .",
    "the important characteristic of a two - mode squeezed state is that there are two quadratures with a phase difference of @xmath41 for which the two modes are highly correlated .",
    "we call these quadratures amplitude @xmath42 and phase @xmath43 in the following .",
    "alice then keeps one mode in her laboratory and performs at random an amplitude or phase measurement using a homodyne detector , where the probability for phase is @xmath44 .",
    "the other mode is sent through a fiber to bob who is as well performing randomly an amplitude or phase measurement with probability @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . due to the property of a two - mode entangled state , alice s and",
    "bob s measurement outcomes are highly correlated if they both perform amplitude or phase measurement and uncorrelated otherwise .    before bob measures amplitude or phase of the incoming signal he performs an energy test .",
    "in particular , he mixes the signal with a vacuum mode @xmath47 using a beam splitter with almost perfect transmittance @xmath48 .",
    "the reflected signal @xmath49 is measured via heterodyne detection , that is , mode @xmath49 is mixed with another vacuum mode @xmath50 by a balanced beam splitter and homodyne detection is performed to measure amplitude of one output @xmath51 ( mode @xmath52 ) and phase @xmath53 of the other output ( mode @xmath54 ) .",
    "the setup is illustrated in figure  [ fig : energy ] .",
    "bob then simply checks whether @xmath55 and @xmath56 is smaller than a prefixed value @xmath57 for every incoming signal and aborts otherwise . in the following",
    "we denote the corresponding test by @xmath58 . in section  [ sec : test ] , we show that conditioned that @xmath58 passes the probability for large amplitude and phase measurements can be bounded .",
    "the diagram shows the measurement setup of bob s test @xmath58 .",
    "he mixes the incoming signal with a vacuum mode @xmath47 using a beam splitter with very low reflectivity @xmath59 and applies a heterodyne detection on the reflected signal @xmath49 .",
    "the test then consists of checking whether the absolute value of the outcome of the amplitude measurement of mode @xmath52 and the phase measurement on @xmath54 is smaller than @xmath57 .",
    ", width=332 ]    while theoretically the spectrum of a homodyne measurement is the real line , any practical implementation is limited by a certain precision .",
    "we account for that by grouping outcomes into intervals of length @xmath60 , where @xmath60 should be larger than the precision of the homodyne detector .",
    "we then choose an @xmath61 smaller than the detector threshold and group the measurements into intervals @xmath62 \\ , , \\\\",
    "i_k & = ( -m + ( k-1)\\delta ,- m + k\\delta ]   , \\   k=2, ... ,2m/\\delta -1 \\ , , \\\\ i_{2m/\\delta } & = ( m-\\delta,\\infty ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we assume that @xmath63 is in @xmath64 .",
    "we thus associate with any measurement result a value in @xmath65 .",
    "it is important for the protocol to have high correlations between alice s and bob s outcome in the index set @xmath66 .",
    "but due to losses in the fiber , bob s amplitude and phase quadratures @xmath67 and @xmath68 will be damped . in order to account for that , we scale the quadrature measurements of alice s detector @xmath69 and @xmath70 before grouping them into the intervals using the transformations @xmath71 the scaling factors @xmath72 and @xmath73 are adjusted according to the channel losses in the transmission of the mode to bob .    for the following ,",
    "we also need a function to measure the strength of the correlations between two strings @xmath74 . for",
    "that we introduce the average distance @xmath75 we further define the average second moment of the difference between the strings by @xmath76 moreover , we define average second moment for the discretized phase and amplitude measurements @xmath77 by @xmath78 here , we subtract @xmath79 since in the absence of an eavesdropper the average value of @xmath80 will be ( approximately ) @xmath79 such that @xmath81 simplifies to the variance .",
    "this holds because the first moments of the amplitude and phase measurements in the absence of eve are @xmath82 , which implies that the first moments of the discretized value will be approximately @xmath79 .",
    "the protocol depends on the total number of prepared two - mode squeezed states @xmath83 , the probability that alice and bob perform a phase measurement @xmath46 , the interval length for the data generation @xmath60 , the threshold parameters @xmath57 and @xmath84 ( see section  [ sec : setup ] ) , and a fixed value @xmath85 used in the parameter estimation test . all classical communication is assumed to be authenticated .",
    "the different steps in the protocol are as follows .    1 .   _ distribution & measurement : _ alice prepares @xmath83 two - mode squeezed states and sends half of it to bob upon which both measure for each mode phase with probability @xmath46 and amplitude with probability @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , bob applies the test @xmath58 , that is , he checks if @xmath87 is satisfied for all of the @xmath83 incoming modes and aborts the protocol otherwise ( see figure  [ fig : energy ] ) .",
    "data generation : _ alice and bob publicly announce their basis choice .",
    "we count with @xmath88 and @xmath89 the number of events in which alice and bob both chose amplitude and phase measurement , respectively . from the measurement with the same basis choice",
    ", they use the amplitude and phase measurements to form @xmath3 and @xmath4 in @xmath90 , and @xmath91and @xmath92 in @xmath93 according to section  [ sec : setup ] .",
    "alice and bob further form a string containing all discretized phase measurements denoted by @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively , where we assume that both have length @xmath96 .",
    "parameter estimation : _ using classical communication , they compute the distance @xmath97 as in   and check if @xmath98 .",
    "if this does not hold they abort the entire protocol .",
    "otherwise , they proceed with the protocol and compute the second moment of the distance @xmath99 according to  .",
    "moreover , they individually compute the average second moments of all their phase measurements @xmath100 and @xmath101 according to  .",
    "classical post - processing _ they run a classical post - processing protocol as described in section  [ sec : clpostpro ] by applying first a one - way reverse reconciliation protocol and secondly hash the corrected raw keys @xmath30 and @xmath4 to final keys @xmath6 and @xmath7 of length @xmath102 .",
    "the crucial point is now to obtain a tight bound on the possible number of secure bits @xmath102 one can generate by the above protocol .",
    "such a bound relies always on a set of assumptions .",
    "such assumptions can , for instance , be a restriction on the attacks of the eavesdropper or simplifications used to model the experimental setup .",
    "we thus start , with a detailed description of our assumptions before presenting the key length formula .",
    "we always assume that alice s and bob s laboratory are secure and closed , that is , no unwanted information leaks from their laboratory .",
    "it is further very important to assume that all random numbers used for the basis choice and the classical post - processing are truly random and independent .",
    "this implies for instance that alice s and bob s basis choice are random and independent which is crucial for the security . while these assumptions are at the ground of most of the security analysis the following are specific for our measurement setup and security proof .    1 .",
    "_ assumptions .",
    "_ we assume that bob s sequential measurement of the values in @xmath66 are independent and correspond to perfect amplitude and phase measurements of the intervals @xmath103 defined in section  [ sec : setup ] . hence",
    ", they can be modeled by integration of the spectrum of one - mode amplitude and phase operators with perfect phase difference of @xmath41   can easily be included . ] . the same applies to bob s test measurement performed in @xmath58 .",
    "we note that ( a ) includes the assumption that the local phase reference used by bob is trusted .",
    "this can be practically justified by either monitoring the phase reference or generating it independently directly on bob s side . for possible attacks on the local oscillator and countermeasures",
    "see , for instance ,  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that we do not make any assumptions on eve s attacks and that there are no requirements on alice s measurement device .",
    "the latter is sometimes referred to as one - sided device independent  @xcite .    as we will discuss in details in section  [ sec : secanalysis ] , security will be inferred from the uncertainty principle with quantum memory for continuous variable systems  @xcite .",
    "the principle says that eve s information about the amplitude measurements is bounded by an overlap term of bob s measurements expressed by @xmath104 and the uncertainty of alice about bob s phase measurement .",
    "the latter can be estimated using the distance @xmath105 and the function @xmath106    moreover , we use the test @xmath58 to upper bound the probability that bob measures an amplitude or phase quadrature larger than @xmath84 by ( see equation  ) @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "hence , the probability can be made sufficiently small by tuning the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath48 , and @xmath84 . using large deviation bounds for the statistical estimation of the raw key sample",
    "we then obtain the following bound on the key length .",
    "[ thm : keylength ] let us consider the above protocol with parameters @xmath109 and assume that the conditions in ( a ) are satisfied .",
