    "@xcite    one such compound , ndnio@xmath0 ( nno ) , has been the subject of a decades - long debate regarding the mechanism of its metal - insulator transition , specifically whether the low - temperature insulating phase results from formation of a mott @xcite or charge - transfer gap,@xcite or is perhaps due to long - range charge ordering .",

    "current - voltage ( @xmath2 ) characteristics encode a wealth of information about the system and make it possible to monitor the temperature - dependent electronic properties .",

    "self - heating is always a concern in low temperature measurements of nanostructures at significant finite biases .",
    "strong self - heating in the presence of a strongly temperature - dependent resistivity , as is common in metal - insulator transitions , can lead to dramatic effects , including hysteresis in the apparent dc @xmath2 response.@xcite we observe no such bistability here .    in the presence of strong local heating , one would expect the effective average sample temperature within the device channel , @xmath15 , to exceed significantly the nominal substrate temperature , @xmath16 .",

    "the model can adequately account for a range of work functions for commonly used contact metals , as well as describe asymmetric behavior that results from microscopic differences between two nominally identical contacts on the same device , for samples measured at and above room temperature .",
    "when we attempted to adapt this result to model our @xmath2 curves obtained at temperatures below 100  k , we found that a kink in the fit near the origin ( which is small when the temperature parameter is of order 300  k ) becomes the dominant feature over the relevant range of bias voltage (  @xmath27  1  v ) .",
