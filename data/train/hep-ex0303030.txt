    "measurements of time - dependent @xmath2 asymmetries in decays provide information about the irreducible phase contained in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark - mixing matrix  @xcite , which describes @xmath2 violation in the standard model .",
    "if a specific @xmath3 decay final state has contributions from more than one amplitude and these amplitudes have different @xmath2-violating weak phases , interference can produce a non - zero @xmath2 asymmetry .",
    "an essential ingredient in @xmath2 violation measurements in decays is flavor tagging . in this paper",
    ", we point out a subtlety of flavor tagging that has been overlooked or ignored in most recent @xmath2 violation analyses , describe the impact of this omission , and propose how to address it in some future measurements .    in the current asymmetric @xmath3-factories  @xcite , pep - ii and kekb ,",
    "meson pairs are produced in @xmath7 interactions at the @xmath8(4s ) resonance , where the pair evolves coherently in a @xmath9-wave state until one of the @xmath3 mesons decays .",
    "typically , one @xmath3 decay is fully reconstructed and the flavor ( whether it s a or ) of this @xmath3 , at the time of the other @xmath3 s decay , is inferred from the decay products of the other @xmath3 ( the tag @xmath3 ) . at the time of the tag @xmath3 meson decay ,",
    "the @xmath3 mesons are known to be in opposite flavor states . in terms of the time difference between the two @xmath3 decays , @xmath10 ,",
    "the time - dependent @xmath2 asymmetry is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of events at @xmath13 with a or as the tag @xmath3 .    charged leptons and kaons are often used to infer the flavor of the tag @xmath3 meson .",
    "the charge of a lepton from a semi - leptonic @xmath3 decay has the same sign as the charge of the @xmath14 quark that produced it .",
    "for example , a high - momentum @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) would indicate that the tag @xmath3 was a ( ) at the time of its decay .",
    "similarly , a @xmath17(@xmath18 ) more often than not comes from a ( ) .",
    "this works because the most likely @xmath14 decay is @xmath19 and the most likely @xmath20 decay is @xmath21 ; thus the @xmath22 quark usually has the same charge as the @xmath14 quark .",
    "the lepton or kaon charge does not always correctly indicate the tag-@xmath3 flavor .",
    "mistags can come from incorrect particle identification or other @xmath3 decay chains that produce wrong - sign leptons or kaons .",
    "the mistag fraction must be measured in order to determine the true @xmath2 asymmetry from the measured one .",
    "it is usually assumed that the measured @xmath2 asymmetry is entirely due to the interfering amplitudes contributing to the fully reconstructed @xmath3 decay mode , and that the individual tagging states , such as @xmath23 , are dominated by a single @xmath3 decay amplitude . in other words , if only one @xmath3 decay amplitude contributes to the tagging final state , it is safe to assume that all interference effects , such as cp violation , are due to the evolution of the fully reconstructed @xmath3 .",
    "this assumption , which is valid for semi - leptonic @xmath3 decays , ignores the possibility of suppressed contributions to the tag - side final state with different weak phases , such as happens for non - leptonic decays .",
    "these suppressed contributions may be important for kaon tags .",
    "for example , the @xmath24 final state with @xmath25 , which is usually associated with a @xmath26 decay , can also be reached from a through a @xmath1 decay .",
    "its amplitude is suppressed relative to the dominant @xmath26 decay amplitude ( @xmath0 ) by a factor of roughly @xmath27 , and has a relative weak phase difference of @xmath28 .",
    "both feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : favsub ] . the tag - side @xmath0 and @xmath1 amplitudes interfere , and , through the coherent evolution of the pair , alter the time evolution of @xmath29 .",
    "the subject of this paper is to investigate the consequences of this small tag - side interference in some of the standard time - dependent @xmath2-asymmetry measurements at @xmath3 factories that use coherent @xmath3 decays .    in sections  [ sec : formalism ]  [ sec : rprime - and - deltaprime ] , we review the general formalism for describing the coherent evolution of the system , define our notation for describing the tag - side amplitude , and state the assumptions we employ in our analysis . in section  [ sec : mistag ] , we evaluate how tag - side interference affects the mistag fraction measured from the amplitude of the time - dependent mixing ( not @xmath2 ) asymmetry .",
    "we find that the tag - side interference effects are _ not _ simply absorbed into the mistag fractions and that , to first order , the mistag fractions are unchanged by tag - side interference . in section  [ sec : sin2beta ] , we evaluate the uncertainty , due to tag - side interference , in the standard mixing - induced @xmath2 asymmetry measurements ",
    "@xmath30 from @xmath31 and the @xmath2 asymmetry in @xmath32 .",
    "we find that the uncertainties are at most 5% , in the most conservative estimation , and can be limited to @xmath33 in most cases with reasonable assumptions .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : sin2bpg ] , we evaluate how tag - side interference affects some of the time - dependent techniques that have been proposed for measuring @xmath28 ( e.g. the time - dependent analysis of @xmath34 ) . here , we find that tag - side interference effects can be as large as the signal asymmetry .",
    "we propose a technique for performing the analysis in a general way , which does not require assumptions about the size of tag - side interference effects and maximizes the statistical sensitivity to @xmath35 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we define our formalism for describing the time evolution of a pair of neutral @xmath3 mesons that are coherently produced in an @xmath36 decay and then subsequently decay to arbitrary final states @xmath37 and @xmath38 at times @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , measured in the parent b meson s rest frame .",

    "the time - independent complex parameters @xmath50 in equation  ( [ eq : f12-defn ] ) can be written generally as where @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is the ( ) decay amplitude to @xmath53 .",
    "the complex ratio @xmath54 parameterizes possible @xmath2 and @xmath55 violation ( @xmath56 ) in the time evolution of a neutral @xmath3 state , while @xmath57 , which is also complex , parametrizes possible @xmath58 and @xmath2 violation ( @xmath59 ) in the time evolution .",
    "note that exchanging the r and t subscripts changes the overall sign of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath13 , leaving eq.([eq : f12-defn ] ) unchanged , which is required since the distinction between the @xmath3 that is reconstructed and the @xmath3 that is used for flavor tagging is arbitrary at this point .",
    "explicitly , we are using the conventions @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath47 are the hermitian matrices of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian are defined as @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which is positive by definition . if @xmath66 , as expected in the standard model , the two terms @xmath67 in eq.([eq : f12-defn ] ) describe the cases where the surviving meson undergoes a net oscillation ( @xmath68 ) @xmath69 or not ( @xmath70 ) between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . combining equations  ( [ eq : f12-defn][eq : a - defns ] ) we obtain with coefficients which satisfy the constraint @xmath71 and are given by @xmath72    in the following , we assume cpt invariance so that @xmath66 , and moreover we take @xmath73 . thus the term @xmath74 no longer enters and @xmath75 is replaced by unity .",

    "secondly , this parameterization cleanly separates the flavor - tag symmetric and antisymmetric components ; the @xmath282 and @xmath20 coefficients are diluted by a factor of @xmath218 , while the @xmath14 coefficient is not , since it has the same sign for tag - side and tag - side events .",
    "the minimum number of independent parameters in which the @xmath102 coefficients can be written is three .",

    "is to take advantage of the fact that lepton tags are immune to the problem ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "if the fit is performed with an independent @xmath20 coefficient for lepton tags , @xmath292 combined with the @xmath282 parameter measured by all flavor tagging categories will help resolve @xmath111 and thus @xmath35 .",

    "since it is possible to have a measured set of @xmath282 , @xmath14 , and @xmath20 parameters that are consistent with @xmath200 when @xmath293 , one must always consider all @xmath92 values between 0 and @xmath294 consistent with @xmath14 and @xmath20 , where @xmath294 is the largest allowed single - final - state value .",
    "this point is illustrated in figure  [ fig : bcpsample ] .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath35 due to @xmath92 and @xmath93 is maximal when @xmath282 is small . in this case , the sensitivity to @xmath35 is mostly from the @xmath20 coefficient and one must rely on flavor tag categories that are known to have @xmath200 , such as lepton tags .",
    "using monte carlo pseudo - experiments , we perform a simplified study of the impact of dcs tag - side interference on a system with only two tagging categories : one for unaffected lepton tags , and the other containing kaon tags . the significance ratio of both categories is set to @xmath295 .",
    "all tests use the realistic value of @xmath296 for @xmath110 and @xmath92 .",
    "each category shares the same @xmath282 parameter .",
    "the lepton category constrains @xmath292 , and the kaon category fits @xmath14 and @xmath20 .",
    "all fit parameters are unbiased , and conform to gaussian distributions .",
    "compared to the situation with no dcs contribution , having one tagging category and identical errors for its two parameters @xmath282 and @xmath20 , the statistical error on @xmath282 is unchanged , and that on @xmath292 has increased by a ratio compatible with @xmath297 .",
    "the parameters @xmath282 and @xmath14 show a @xmath298 correlation , while all other correlations are smaller than @xmath299 .    one experimental strategy for reducing the uncertainties due to @xmath92 and @xmath93 would be to constrain them by performing a time - dependent analysis of a flavor - specific final state that has no dcs contribution ( @xmath300 ) , such as @xmath301 .",
    "for such a final state , the undiluted @xmath14 coefficient is the same as for @xmath34 and @xmath20 now has @xmath300 .",
    "this information can be used to recover the @xmath35 sensitivity in the @xmath20 coefficients in the signal sample that was lost due to the lack of knowledge of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "another option would be to include in the analysis events for which it was not possible to determine the flavor of the tag , so - called untagged events . from equations  [ eq : abcpars - s1 ] through  [ eq : abcpars - s4 ] , one can see that the untagged @xmath102 coefficient for a reconstructed @xmath263 ( @xmath34 ) is equal to @xmath302 ( @xmath303 ) , thus untagged events provide a further constraint on @xmath14 .",
    "the measured @xmath282 , @xmath14 , and @xmath20 coefficients for the various tagging categories and samples can be combined by forming a @xmath304 using the measured parameters and the inverted covariance matrix .",
    "this assumes that the measurement uncertainties on the @xmath282 , @xmath14 , and @xmath20 parameters are gaussian .",
    "a constraint on @xmath35 can be derived from the @xmath304 by scanning the @xmath304 vs @xmath35 where for each @xmath35 value the @xmath304 is minimized with respect to the unknown parameters @xmath111 , @xmath93 , and @xmath92 .",
    "if there are no external constraints on @xmath92 and @xmath93 , such as from the analysis of @xmath301 suggested above , the @xmath14 and @xmath20 parameters from non - lepton tags do not provide much information , since @xmath92 must be varied from its minimum value compatible with @xmath14 to its maximum possible value ( for example , see figure  [ fig : bcpsample ] ) .",
    "the non - lepton - tag @xmath14 and @xmath20 parameters still must be included in the time - dependent fit , but they are not very useful in the @xmath304 analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : chisqscans ] shows an example of the @xmath304 procedure for a hypothetical measurement where @xmath305 , @xmath306 , and @xmath307 .",
    "the measured values of the @xmath282 , @xmath14 , and @xmath20 coefficients were set to the correct values , so the @xmath304 is zero at the correct and degenerate solutions .",
    "the two plots in figure  [ fig : chisqscans ] illustrate two cases : a ) one with non - zero tag - side dcs interference , and b ) one without tag - side interference .",
    "in addition to the curve which allows for any value of @xmath92 , labeled ` envelope ' , additional curves with fixed values of @xmath92 are included .",
    "the statistical errors correspond to a measurement from @xmath5 in roughly 450 fb@xmath223 of @xmath3-factory data from one experiment including a constraint from @xmath308 .",
    "three important conclusions can be drawn from figure  [ fig : chisqscans ] .",
    "first , comparing envelope curves for the @xmath309 case a ) to the @xmath200 case b ) , the measurements give nearly identical constraints on @xmath35 .",
    "this means that the uncertainty on @xmath92 and @xmath93 does not affect the measurement .",
    "the only degradation with respect to the situation with no tag - side interference is that , when not including @xmath310 in the analysis , the non - lepton - tag @xmath20 parapeters no longer contain useful information .",
    "the second conclusion is that if @xmath92 is non - zero , the constraint on @xmath35 can be better than the case where @xmath92 is zero",
    ". if so , the @xmath14 and @xmath20 parameters in the @xmath311 sample will in general be non - zero , and one effectively adds a measurement of @xmath35 from the tag - side @xmath3 .",
    "this can be seen most clearly from the symmetry between the tag - side and reconstruction - side within the definitions of @xmath282 , @xmath14 , and @xmath20 in eqns .",
    "( [ eqn : a]-[eqn : c ] ) . an extreme ,",
    "unrealistic example is given by the solid line in case a ) of figure 5 .",
    "it shows what the constraint looks like if @xmath92 would equal @xmath296 , and if that information were known precisely and were included in the analysis .",
    "thirdly , the result for @xmath312 alone , after varying @xmath92 to arbitrarily large values , is equivalent to the @xmath304 curve constructed from only @xmath282 and @xmath292 . in other words , when not including the @xmath311 sample in the analysis , the @xmath14 and non - lepton - tag @xmath20 parameters do not contribute to the sensitivity to @xmath35 .",
    "again , however , these degrees of freedom must still be included in the data analysis .",
    "interference effects between ckm - favored @xmath0 and doubly - ckm - suppressed @xmath1 amplitudes in final states used for flavor tagging in coherent @xmath313 pairs from @xmath8(4s ) decays introduce deviations from the standard time evolution assumed in @xmath2 violation measurements at the asymmetric - energy @xmath3 factories . to our knowledge ,",
    "the uncertainty introduced by this interference has been neglected in most @xmath3 factory @xmath2 violation measurements published to date , with the exception of  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties introduced in the @xmath314 measurement in @xmath315 decay modes and the time dependent analysis of the @xmath32 final state are at most of the order of 5% and can be limited to @xmath316% in most cases with reasonable assumptions .    in proposed measurements of @xmath6 which explicitly use interference between ckm - favored and doubly - ckm - suppressed amplitude contributions in the final state that is reconstructed , such as @xmath5 , tag - side interference effects can be as large as the interference effects one is trying to measure . in any such analysis , the data must be analyzed in a way that is general enough to allow for tag - side interference effects .",
    "we have proposed a general framework for dealing with tag - side interference effects in @xmath6 measurements .",
