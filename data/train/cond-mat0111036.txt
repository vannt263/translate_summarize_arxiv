    "although the propagation of a front into an unstable state plays an important role in various physical situations ranging from the pearling instability @xcite to dielectric breakdown @xcite , detailed experimental tests of the explicit theoretical predications , especially those for the velocity of so - called `` pulled '' fronts are scarce .",
    "one of the reasons lies in the difficulty in preparing the system in the unstable state .",
    "if the initial front profile is steep enough the propagating front converges to a unique shape and velocity .",
    "theoretically , one distinguishes two regimes for front propagation into unstable states : the so - called `` pushed '' regime , where the front is driven by the nonlinearities and the so - called `` pulled '' regime where the asymptotic velocity of the propagating front , @xmath0 , equals the spreading speed @xmath1 of linear perturbations around the unstable state : @xmath2 .",
    "pushed fronts are by definition those for which the asymptotic speed @xmath0 is larger than @xmath1 : @xmath3 .",
    "it is thus as if a `` pulled '' front is literally `` pulled '' by the leading edge whose dynamics is driven by linear instability of the unstable state @xcite ; the nonlinearities merely cause saturation behind the front .",
    "we focus here on the experimental tests of the dynamics of such pulled fronts ; since @xmath1 is determined by the equations linearized about the unstable state , the front velocity of pulled fronts can often be calculated explicitly , even for relatively complicated situations .",
    "there have been two experiments aimed at testing the predictions for the speed of pulled fronts .",
    "almost 20 years ago ahlers and cannell @xcite studied the propagation of a vortex - front into the laminar state in rotating taylor - couette flow .",
    "the measured velocities were about 40% smaller than expected from the theoretical predictions .",
    "a few years later , however , fineberg and steinberg ( fs ) @xcite published data which appeared to confirm the expected velocity in a rayleigh - bnard convection experiment to within about 1% .",
    "the issue then seemed to be settled when it was also shown that the discrepancy observed by ahlers could be traced back to slow transients @xcite .",
    "the theoretical developments of the last few years give every reason to reconsider the old experiments by fs : it has been shown @xcite that the convergence of the velocity of pulled fronts is _ always _ very slow , in fact with leading and subleading universal terms of @xmath4 and @xmath5 with prefactors which follow from the linearized equation .",
    "this slow relaxation implies that it will in general be very difficult to measure the asymptotic front speed to within a percent or so in any realistic experiment .",
    "hence , from this new perspective , the proper question is not why in the taylor - couette experiment the measured velocity was too low , but why apparently in the rayleigh - bnard experiment of fs the asymptotic front speed was measured .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to address this issue , and to reanalyze the experiments in the light of the present theory .",
    "we will conclude that the data of fs actually do show signs of the predicted power law convergence of the front velocity to an extrapolated asymptotic value which is about 15% larger than their transient value .",
    "this of course implies that there is then a discrepancy of order 15% between the value of @xmath2 as extrapolated from their data , and the one claimed in the original experiments .",
    "we will argue that the most likely reconciliation of the two results is that the value of the correlation length @xmath6 in the experimental cell of fs is somewhat larger than the theoretical value used by fs to interpret their data .    of course",
    ", _ only new experiments can settle whether the interpretation we propose is the correct one_. we do consider new experiments along the lines of fs in fact very desirable , not so much as they might settle the numerical value of the velocity , but more because they hold the promise of being the first accurate experimental test of the universal power law relaxation of pulled fronts .    in section",
    "ii we will first summarize the relevant theoretical predictions for the velocity of pulled fronts .",
    "then we will discuss the experiments of fs in the light of these results in section iii , where we will also reanalyze their data . finally , in section iv we turn to a brief discussion of the wavenumber of the pattern selected by the front . here , the results of fs were not quite consistent with the predictions for the asymptotic wavenumber from the swift - hohenberg equation",
    ". as we shall discuss , the wavelength of the pattern is affected by various effects which are not easily controlled , but the most likely interpretation of the data of fs is that they did not observe the asymptotic wavelength behind the front , but the local wavenumber in the leading edge of the front .",
    "indeed it is in general difficult to test the theory by studying the asymptotic pattern wavelength and the convergence to the asymptotic value experimentally .",
    "just above the onset of a transition to stationary finite wavelength patterns , for small dimensionless control parameters @xmath7 the slow dynamics on length scales larger than the wavelength of the pattern can be described by the ginzburg - landau amplitude equation @xcite @xmath8 the time scale @xmath9 and length scale @xmath6 as well as the nonlinear saturation parameter @xmath10 depend on the particular system under study .",
    "the asymptotic spreading speed @xmath1 of linear perturbations around the unstable state is in general obtained from the linear dispersion relation @xmath11 of a fourier mode @xmath12 through @xmath13 this yields for the ginzburg - landau equation @xcite @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the experiments with which we will compare , the scaled velocity @xmath16 is often used .",
    "according to ( [ v*form ] ) , for a pulled front the asymptotic value @xmath17 .",
    "the above results were known in the eighties , at the time when the experiments were done .",
    "the crucial insight of the last few years is the finding that the convergence or relaxation towards the asymptotic velocity @xmath1 of pulled fronts is _ always _ extremely slow : the general expression for the time dependent velocity @xmath18 emerging from steep initial conditions ( i.e. , decaying faster than @xmath19 ) is given by @xcite @xmath20 for the case of the ginzburg - landau amplitude equation , we then have @xmath21 it is important to stress that the above expression for @xmath18 is exact but asymptotic  this is illustrated by the fact that at time @xmath22 the subdominant @xmath23 term is equal to the first correction term of order @xmath24 in absolute value , but of opposite sign .",
    "thus , although for any sufficiently long time @xmath25 , the above expression will always become accurate , at any finite time , however , the expression might only yield a good estimate .",
    "in fact , in practice one usually has to go to dimensionless times @xmath26 of order 10 or larger for the asymptotic expression to become accurate , while for dimensionless times @xmath27 in the range 3 to 10 the first correction term yields a reasonable order - of - magnitude estimate @xcite . as we shall see below , in the rayleigh - bnard experiments @xcite the maximum dimensionless time @xmath28 that can be probed is about 3 to 4 . in comparing with experiments and in making order of magnitude estimates",
    ", we will therefore only use the first correction term .",
    "finally it is important to realize that after how long a time these expressions become really accurate , depends also on the initial conditions .      in order to illustrate how accurate these expressions are in practice",
    ", we numerically integrate the real ginzburg - landau equation starting with an exponentially decaying initial condition with steepness @xmath29 @xcite : @xmath30 . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] for various values of @xmath29 .",
    "we see that initially the velocity falls off quickly and then approaches the asymptotic velocity from below , and that the asymptotic expression ( [ asympscaled ] ) in practice does yield a reasonable estimate of the time dependent velocity for values of the scaled time of order 3 and larger .",
    "we also note that the theoretical analysis shows that for initial profiles falling off exponentially with steepness @xmath31 , the asymptotic velocity lies above @xmath1 and is given by @xmath32 . the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] shows an example of a case with @xmath29 slightly less than @xmath33 , for which @xmath34 . in this case , the time - dependent scaled velocity is approximately equal to 2 at times of order 3 to 4 .    in the experiments , the typical protocol was to simultaneously increase the heat flux from an initial state at @xmath35 ( with a typical value of @xmath36 ) to a supercritical value @xmath37 , and switching on the end heater .",
    "a rapid convergence to the asymptotic velocity due to special initial conditions with @xmath38 would have required setting @xmath39 for all @xmath37 and would probably also have required switching on the end heater before the value of @xmath7 was changed , so that effectively at the end a convection pattern was prepared whose amplitude decayed exponentially into the bulk .",
    "thus , it is theoretically possible to select special initial conditions so as to get a scaled velocity around 2 at some finite time , but the finetuning necessary to do so is so sensitive that we consider it very unlikely that experimental observations done over a range of values of @xmath7 are due to initial condition effects . as stressed before , only new experiments can completely rule out this possibility , however .",
    "in the long quasi - one - dimensional rayleigh - bnard cell of fs @xcite the front propagation was initiated by simultaneously increasing the heat flux to a supercritical value @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and switching on a heater at the ends of the long cell .",
    "a vortex front is induced near the this heated end - wall and the propagation of this front into the unstable conductive state is then studied .",
    "thin fins were attached to the long sides of the cell to avoid both induction of long rolls and pinning .",
    "both because of the fact that the initial perturbation was caused by heating at the end and because the state before bringing the temperature difference beyond its critical value was unrelated to the final value of @xmath7 , there is every reason to believe that the experimental protocol did not create any special initial conditions that can not be considered sufficiently steep or localized .    as fs point out ,",
    "since the front velocity @xmath1 grows as @xmath42 while the growth rate in the bulk grows as @xmath7 , fronts can only be observed and in fact dominate the dynamics for small enough @xmath7 . in practice",
    "the pattern could be distinguished from the bulk noise up to a time @xmath43 where the numerical factor @xmath44 is of order 34 .",
    "this determines some upper limit @xmath45 on @xmath7 for which the front can advance of the order of @xmath46th of the cell length @xmath47 before bulk growth takes over : @xmath48    let us now estimate , using our analytical estimate ( [ asympscaled ] ) , the relative importance of the correction term at the latest times of order @xmath49 at which measurements can be taken .",
    "substitution gives @xmath50 thus , for the latest time accessible in the experiment , we obtain with the empirical experimental value @xmath5134 a velocity which is of order @xmath52 below the asymptotic value . although the asymptotic formula may not be accurate yet at such early times , the numerical results of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] lead one to expect corrections of the same order of magnitude : these times also correspond to scaled times of order @xmath44 in the numerical simulation plots of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , and as we have seen , over this time range , the velocity is also suppressed by about 15% relative to the asymptotic value . hence , by any reasonable estimate , the slow relaxation can not be negligible in the experiments !    as stated in the introduction , fs quoted a measured velocity @xmath53 for their experiments , contrary to our expectation that their scaled velocity should have been in the neighborhood of 1.7 . according to the theoretical results",
    ", one should expect to get to within 1% of the asymptotic velocity only around a dimensionless time of order 100 !    in our view",
    ", the most plausible explanation for the origin of this discrepancy is that the value @xmath6 was actually larger in the experiments than the value used in the analysis .",
    "the value of @xmath9 was experimentally confirmed to be very close to the theoretical value @xcite . for @xmath6 , however , the theoretical value was used without independent experimental check @xcite . because of the special design of the cell with side - fins to create one - dimensional patterns , a different value of @xmath6 might not be unexpected .",
    "in fact , an indication that @xmath6 in the experiments was larger than the theoretical value used in the analysis , comes from the observation of fs that the value of the wavelength at onset was 13% larger than the theoretical value .",
    "this might indicate that all lengths in the experiments are a factor 1.13 larger than the theoretical values , and this is precisely the factor needed to reconcile the front data with the theoretical expectations !",
    "one should keep in mind , though , that @xmath6 is determined by the the curvature of @xmath7 versus @xmath54 tongue around the critical wavenumber , and that it is not guaranteed that both are changed by the same factor ; only independent measurements can fully settle this issue .",
    "we now show that a reanalysis of the data of fs actually gives quite convincing evidence for slow convergence effects in the experimental fronts .",
    "fs measured the velocity by comparing the front with itself at various time intervals , by appropriately shifting the traces back .",
    "this yielded a set of points in the @xmath55 , @xmath56 plane which appeared to lie on a straight line . however a possible relaxation of the velocity was masked since points from early and later times will approximately fall in the same place in the plane , and because the front shape also has an asymptotic @xmath57 relaxation .",
    "we therefore have tried to reanalyze the raw data of figure 2 from the fs paper ; this space - time plot of a propagating from is reproduced in the top panel of our fig .",
    "we define the position of the front as the point where the interpolation of the maxima of the profile equals some fraction of its maximum in the bulk ( we chose 0.4 ) .",
    "our data for @xmath58 obtained this way are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "whereas the local velocity initially slightly decreases , an increase for dimensionless times larger than 0.5 is evident .",
    "we stress that this qualitative behavior is independent of the choice of the parameters . in order to compare quantitatively to the predictions for the relaxation",
    ", we have used the value for @xmath9 given by fs but increased the value of @xmath6 by 13% on the basis of the argument given above .",
    "clearly , with this choice , the data are certainly consistent with the analytical as well as numerical estimates of the velocity relaxation  in fact , in a way the data are the first experimental indications for the universal power law relaxation of pulled fronts @xcite .",
    "fs also studied the problem of the selection of the wavelength @xmath59 . as we discussed",
    "before , the actual value of the wavelength @xmath60 of the patterns is at criticality about 13% off from the theoretical value ; however , we are not interested here in the absolute value , but in the relative variation of @xmath61 .",
    "the difficulty of comparing theory and experiment on the variation of the wavelength is that the only theorically sharply defined quantity is the wavelength sufficiently far behind the front , @xmath62 , and that one has to go beyond the lowest order ginzburg - landau treatment to be able to study the pattern wavelength left behind .",
    "e.g. , if we use a swift - hohenberg equation for a system with critical wavenumber @xmath63 and bare correlation length @xmath6 , @xmath64 then a node counting argument @xcite yields for the _ asymptotic _ wavelength @xmath62 far behind the front @xcite : @xmath65 in the rayleigh - bnard experiments , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the cell height ; the theoretical value is @xmath68 , so if our conjecture that the value is some 15% larger is correct , we get @xmath69 .",
    "this then gives @xmath70 as we stressed already above @xmath62 is the wavelength far behind the front ; for a propagating pulled front , there is another important quantity which one can calculate analytically , the local wavelength @xmath71 measured in the leading edge of the front . for the swift - hohenberg equation , one gets for this quantity@xcite @xmath72 where in the last line we have used the experimental values .",
    "let us now discuss the experimental findings in the light of these results . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we show both the experimental values of @xmath73 as determined experimentally by fs , and results for the swift - hohenberg equation with the value ( [ expval ] ) relevant for the experiments . + for small @xmath7 , the experimental values are roughly linear in @xmath7 , but when a fit is made over the whole range of @xmath7 values studied , a square root behavior , as proposed by fs , would probably be better .",
    "+ the experimental values for the wavelength ratio deviate about a factor of 3 from the theoretically expected value for the ratio far behind the front , @xmath74 .",
    "+ just like the front speed converges very slowly to the asymptotic value , so does the local value of the wavelength behind the front @xcite .",
    "the relaxation of the velocity is plotted with a dashed - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] for times about @xmath75 , which is the time it takes for a front to propagate to close to the center of a system about as large as the experimental cell .",
    "clearly , the wavelength ratio due to slow relaxation lies below the asymptotic value , and hence further away from the experimental data for small @xmath7 . also , numerical results for the wavelength of the fourth `` roll '' measured at the same time ( indicated by the dotted line , lie below the asymptotic curve .",
    "+ fs have measured the wavelength for very small values of @xmath7 , down to @xmath76 .",
    "however , already for values as small as 0.01 , the coherence length @xmath77 is about @xmath78 in the experiments .",
    "the total front width is several times this number , and for even smaller values of @xmath7 the front width is even smaller . since the total experimental cell was about @xmath79 long in the experiments , it is clear that over much of the small @xmath7 range , one would not expect to see well - developed fronts in the experiments . in other words , it is very unlikely that over the experimental range of @xmath7-values , one has a chance to measure @xmath62 of a well - developed pattern behind a front . +",
    "the grey line in the plot shows our analytical result for the wavelength ratio in the leading edge of the front .",
    "clearly , this line follows the data for small @xmath7 quite well . in view also of point _",
    "( iv ) _ above that it will be hard to obtain well - developed fronts for small @xmath7 , we propose as a tentative explanation of the data that in the small @xmath7 range , one actually measures the emergent roll pattern associated with the leading edge of a front .",
    "of course , only new experiments can decide on the validity of this suggestion .",
    "+ we mention that the variation of the wavelength ratio with @xmath7 depends also on the third order derivative term in the expansion of the dispersion relation around the critical wavenumber .",
    "this term is not modeled correctly in the swift - hohenberg equation , but may have to be taken into account in a full comparison of theory and experiment .",
    "+ we finally mention that in the experiments there was an up - down asymmetry in the rolls .",
    "we have investigated whether this could be a source of the discrepancy between the asymptotic wavelength ratio and the observed one , by studying a swift - hohenberg equation with a symmetry - breaking quadratic term . however , with this term , the wavelength ratio apears to decrease away from the experimental values .",
    "it was recently discovered that quite generally pulled fronts relax very slowly to their asymptotic velocity .",
    "comparison of the experimental data for the velocity with numerical simulations and analytical estimates give , in our view , evidence that these experiments provide clear signs of the presence of such slow relaxation effects , although the time scales that can be probed experimentally are too short to test the general power law relaxation .",
    "theoretically the only other viable option to reconcile theory with the interpretation originally proposed @xcite is that somehow special initial conditions created an initial convection profile with precisely the right spatial decay into the bulk . as we discussed in section iii , in our view",
    "this is an unlikely interpretation , but only new experiments can settle this issue completely . while measurements of the wavelength of the pattern generated by a front are even more difficult to interpret than those of the velocity , our analysis indicates that in the small-@xmath7 regimes a well - developed front does not fit into the experimental cell , and that as a result one probes the local wavelength in the leading edge of the front rather than the well - developed asymptotic wavelength behind it .",
    "the analytical estimates are consistent with this suggestion .",
    "we hope that this work will trigger new experimental activity to investigate these issues  experiments along these lines hold the promise of being the first ones to see the universal power law relaxation of pulled fronts .",
    "we are grateful to jay fineberg and victor steinberg for correspondence about their work and about the issue discussed in this paper .",
    "wvs would also like to thank guenter ahlers for urging him to analyze to what extent slow convergence plays a role in the rayleigh - bnard experiments .",
