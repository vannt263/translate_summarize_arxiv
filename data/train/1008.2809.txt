    "this remarkable sign change with @xmath1 has not been observed before for any nucleon form factor or transition amplitude . at high @xmath1 ,",
    "both amplitudes are qualitatively described by the light front quark models , which is consistent with the interpretation of the state as a radial excitation of the nucleon at short distances .",
    "the low @xmath1 behavior is not well described by the lf quark models which fall short of describing the amplitude at the photon point .",
    "this suggests that important contributions , e.g. meson - baryon interactions describing the large distances behavior , are missing , as has also been recently demonstrated in a covariant valence quark model@xcite . a first exploration of the roper transition form factors has recently been undertaken within lattice qcd@xcite .",
    "electroproduction cross section measurements of strangeness channel , e.g. @xmath47 , and polarization transfer measurements @xmath48 , ( @xmath49 ) have been carried out@xcite that allow stringent tests of hadronic models .",
