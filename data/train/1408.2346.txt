    "hundred years have passed since the discovery of cosmic radiation , and an accurate reconstruction of both the energy and mass of primary cosmic rays at high energies still remains a compelling need in contemporary astro - particle physics .",
    "only recently the methods for detection of coherent mhz radiation from extensive air showers as well as the understanding of the underlying emission physics have been strongly improved , reaching important milestones @xcite .",
    "a precise reconstruction of both the primary energy and the depth of the shower maximum ( x@xmath0 ) of air showers is a fundamental goal for modern radio detection , which aims to become competitive and complementary to the already well - established fluorescence and cherenkov detection techniques , limited , in contrast to the radio technique , to a low duty cycle @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we present a method ( slope method ) , which obtains information on the energy and the depth of maximum of air showers from features of the lateral distribution of the radio signals : on the one hand , a defined distance from the shower axis exists where the reconstruction of the primary energy is affected least by shower - to - shower fluctuations .",
    "the presence of such a characteristic distance was previously predicted with reas2 simulations @xcite .",
    "here , we demonstrate on the basis of state - of - the - art coreas simulations @xcite that such a characteristic distance is still present when refractive index effects and radiation due to the variation of the number of charged particles are taken into account , and that measurements at this distance can thus be exploited for an energy determination . on the other hand ,",
    "the slope of the radio lateral distribution is related to the geometrical distance between the observer and the radio source @xcite .",
    "therefore , information on the depth of shower maximum ( x@xmath0 ) and consecutively on the type of primary particle initiating the shower , can be directly extracted from the radio lateral distribution measurement : for iron - initiated air showers , which start earlier and develop faster in the atmosphere compared to proton - initiated air showers , the radio source is typically further away from an observer at ground , and thus the slope of the lateral distribution is flatter in comparison .",
    "recently , this sensitivity of the slope of the measured radio lateral distribution to the development of air showers has been proven experimentally with lopes measurements @xcite .",
    "we strive to take a practical approach tailored to the data quality provided by the lopes experiment . in particular , we aim to develop an analysis strategy which can exploit the potential of lopes in light of its experimental limitations ( relatively low number of antennas , limited lateral distance range covered in a single measurement , relatively high background noise ) without becoming overly involved and complex . for experiments with higher data quality",
    ", the methods presented here should thus be refined and further improved .",
    "another independent method has been separately developed and applied on lopes measurements to extract information on x@xmath0 .",
    "this method considers the shape of the radio wave front @xcite , but lower precision in the reconstruction of x@xmath0 compared to the slope method was achieved .",
    "the slope and wavefront methods could in the future also be combined with each other and with further methods such as the determination of the pulse width , or spectral slope @xcite , respectively , or the determination of the position of the cherenkov ring @xcite .",
    "coreas simulations @xcite , which include a realistic treatment of the refractive index of the atmosphere , are more sophisticated and more complete than simulations with the reas predecessor codes .",
    "the remarkable agreement between coreas simulations and the measured slope of the radio lateral distribution @xcite makes studies based on coreas simulations even more promising than previous analyses .",
    "an amplitude scale mismatch between the measured ( lopes ) and simulated ( coreas ) radio pulses still exists @xcite .",
    "however , it does not affect the part of this analysis in which the slope of the radio lateral distribution , i.e. , the ratio of amplitudes at different distances , is considered .",
    "it only has influence when absolute amplitude values are used , i.e. , in our case on the investigation of the energy reconstruction ( sec .",
    "[ sec_energy ] ) , in which it will influence the calibration constants determined for the linear correlations between primary particle energy and radio amplitude .",
    "taking the analysis described in @xcite as a guideline , we enhance and further improve the slope method . as a first step ,",
    "we apply the slope method directly on pure coreas simulations , deriving important calibration parameters . in a second step ,",
    "we apply the slope method on events measured with lopes to investigate the reconstruction of the total primary energy and the depth the shower maximum .",
    "lopes @xcite is one of the pioneering experiments in the digital detection of radio emission from air showers . placed at karlsruhe institute of technology , germany , lopes benefits from the co - location with the particle detector experiment kascade - grande @xcite , which provides us with the reconstruction of fundamental air - shower parameters : arrival direction , shower core , and primary energy .",
    "characteristic for the lopes analysis pipeline is the interferometric combination of the recorded electric field strength traces : according to the arrival direction of the air shower , the traces detected in each individual antenna are first shifted in time .",
    "afterwards , a cross - correlation beam ( cc - beam ) and a power - beam , which gives the total power received in all the antennas , are computed @xcite .",
    "the digital cross - correlation beam forming plays an important role also for the reconstruction of the lateral distribution of amplitudes .",
    "indeed , both the cc - beam and the power - beam are crucial for the selection of events with a clear radio signal , and for the determination of the exact time of the radio pulse ( cc - beam time ) .",
    "a hilbert envelope is applied to the up - sampled trace of each individual antenna , and the maximum instantaneous amplitude of the radio signal is defined by the local maximum of the hilbert envelope closest to the cc - beam time .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the events selected for the slope method analysis presented here have been measured with the lopes30 and lopespol setups @xcite .",
    "the former consisted of 30 calibrated dipole antennas , all oriented in the east - west direction , while the latter used 15 east - west and 15 north - south - aligned antennas . for the purpose of this analysis , only data of the east - west oriented channels are taken into account , primarily due to the higher available statistics @xcite . the effective frequency band used for the analysis is 43 - 74  mhz .",
    "the selected events have a primary energy between 10@xmath2 and 10@xmath3  ev , a zenith angle less then 40@xmath4 and a core position at a maximum distance of 90  m from the center of the kascade array - ( 0  m  west - east , 0  m  south - north ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_map_selection ] .",
    "these cuts are made to achieve high quality in the kascade air shower reconstruction .",
    "a high signal - to - noise ratio and high coherence for the radio signal in the antennas is required as well by forcing the signal - to - noise ratio of the cc - beam , i.e. ( amplitude of the cross - correlation beam / rms of the cross - correlation beam  @xmath5 ) , since not always all the 30 antennas participate in each event ] to be larger than 9 , and the fraction of correlated power in the antennas ( cc - beam / power - beam ) larger than 80  % .",
    "further quality cuts demand a good fit for the lateral distribution function ( sec .",
    "[ sec_ldf ] ) .",
    "all cuts are chosen to achieve high standards in the kascade - grande data reconstruction and high quality radio measurements , yet simultaneously acquire good statistics .",
    "205 events of almost 900 kascade - grande pre - selected showers remain after applying all cuts .",
    "the coreas code is one of the latest developments of simulation codes reflecting an increasingly precise knowledge and an improved modelling of the radio emission from air showers @xcite . through the inclusion of a realistic treatment of the refractive index of the atmosphere ,",
    "coreas simulations take into account cherenkov - like time - compression of the radio emission occurring for observers near the cherenkov angle .",
    "this effect has been recognized to be the main reason for the previously measured flattening of the radio lateral distribution close to the shower axis @xcite .",
    "the flattening effects depend on the geometrical distance of the shower maximum to the observer , and thus on both the zenith angle of the air shower and on the type of the primary particle .",
    "a detailed comparison between coreas simulations and lopes measurements is presented in @xcite .    for the following analysis , corsika @xcite and coreas",
    "are used to simulate the particle cascade and the radio emission from the electromagnetic component of air showers , respectively .",
    "qgsjet  ii.03 @xcite and fluka @xcite are used as high energy and low energy interaction models , respectively .",
    "specific criteria are applied to generate the coreas simulations to facilitate the final application of the slope method directly on lopes data . on the one hand ,",
    "the specific individual events measured by lopes are simulated : the energy , the incoming direction and the core position of each lopes event , reconstructed from the measurements with the particle detector kascade(-grande ) @xcite , are used as input parameters for the simulations .",
    "the simulated electric field is filtered with an ideal rectangular bandpass filter ( 43 - 74  mhz ) .",
    "the geomagnetic field for the simulations is set to values valid for the lopes site ( 47 @xmath6 t magnetic field strength , 65@xmath4 inclination angle , negligible declination ) . with this procedure ,",
    "the geometrical acceptance and important characteristics of the lopes experiment are taken into account .",
    "each lopes event is simulated as both proton and iron primary . on the other hand ,",
    "the observer positions in the simulations appropriately represent the antenna positions in the lopes array : for each individual event , the correct positions of the individual lopes antennas with respect to the shower core are taken into account .",
    "for the selected events , the cores of the shower typically lie in between the antennas , thus the fit of the lateral distribution function ( ldf ) does not only involve observer positions in a specific azimuthal direction relative to the core . as a consequence ,",
    "the charge excess effect which typically contributes to the total radio emission at a level of @xmath7  % @xcite in aera , and can be expected to be about half as important in lopes due to the stronger local magnetic field , is included in the following analysis .",
    "we can thus judge the robustness of our method in light of the complex asymmetries present in the actual measured radio lateral distributions .",
    "no pre - selection of typical showers ( showers with a typical x@xmath0 value ) is applied to the coreas simulations .",
    "therefore , shower - to - shower fluctuations are included in the investigation for the data set as a whole .",
    "the lateral distribution function ( ldf ) describes the measured ( or simulated ) electric field as a function of the observer position with respect to the shower axis . due to the superposition of geomagnetic and charge - excess radiation in radio emission from extensive air showers ,",
    "the ldf can exhibit significant asymmetries @xcite .",
    "ideally , therefore a two - dimensional ldf taking into account the observer azimuth angle in addition to the axis distance should be fitted to the measured radio data . in the case of lopes , however , the limited number of antennas sampling the true ldf led us to apply a simpler approach . instead of an asymmetric two - dimensional ldf",
    ", we apply a one - dimensional ldf to our data , thereby effectively averaging out the asymmetries in the true ldf . depending on the coverage in the sampled antenna locations ,",
    "a per - event amplitude shift can be introduced by this procedure .",
    "this effect possibly leads to increased scatter in the fitted amplitudes , which is , however , implicitly accounted for in the following analysis .",
    "another effect of the one - dimensional averaging could be an overall bias in the calibration of radio - amplitudes to primary particle energies determined by kascade . to quantify these two effects , we compared simulations including the charge - excess asymmetry with special simulations in which the charge - excess contribution has been removed .",
    "the result of this dedicated study are : the use of a one - dimensional ldf increases the scatter observed in the amplitude - energy correlations by an amount that is negligible with respect to other uncertainties , in particular lopes experimental uncertainties . for the data set as a whole a systematic bias of 4.4% in the estimated average amplitudes arises , which we account for in the following energy correlation analysis by adopting an extra systematic uncertainty of 5% , well - below our global experimental calibration scale uncertainty of 35% .",
    "the uncertainty of the measured electric field amplitudes we fit with our one - dimensional ldf is taken as the root sum of squared uncertainties due to the individual antenna calibration ( 5  % ) and due to the noise @xcite .",
    "the distance of the antennas from the shower axis is calculated in the shower - plane coordinate system with a correlated uncertainty which depends on both the kascade precision ( @xmath8  4  m @xcite ) and the geometry reconstruction accuracy ( @xmath9  0.3@xmath4 ) .",
    "in contrast , the coreas electric field at each observer position is assumed to be exact , thus no uncertainty is associated with the pulse amplitude .",
    "the coreas simulations are able to reproduce the complexity of the measured radio ldf , including asymmetries and flattening due to cherenkov - like time compression effects . even at the distances probed by the lopes experiment ,",
    "this complexity is clearly visible @xcite . since only events with a core position relatively close to the antenna array",
    "are selected ( sec .",
    "[ sec_evselection ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_map_selection ] ) , the flattening of the radio lateral distribution close to the reconstructed core becomes an important aspect for our investigation . in previous lopes analyses ,",
    "we have used an exponential function to fit data and simulations of lopes events @xcite . here , we prefer to use a one - dimensional gaussian function @xmath10 with @xmath11 [ @xmath6v / m / mhz ] , @xmath12 [ m ] , and @xmath13 [ m ] as free parameters to fit the lopes ldf . while the average lopes event can be fitted by either a one - dimensional exponential or a gaussian with similar quality , there are two advantages in using the gaussian . for one ,",
    "there are some events for which the gaussian can fit the data well , while the exponential gives a considerably worse fit .",
    "second , and more importantly , we develop our analysis method on the basis of coreas simulations , and for simulated events the gaussian fits considerably better than an exponential . we illustrate this with a comparison of a gaussian and an exponential fit to data and simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig_lpldf_gfit ] .",
    "we stress that the analysis presented here can be ( and has also been ) performed on the basis of an exponential ldf , and the results agree within the systematic uncertainties quoted here .",
    "however , for the above reasons , we prefer to use a gaussian ldf .",
    "besides the depth of the shower maximum ( x@xmath0 ) , the air - shower inclination influences the slope of the radio ldf .",
    "this is related as well to a geometrical effect : near - vertical events constitute a radio source closer to the observer at ground level than inclined showers , and therefore are characterized by a steeper slope of the radio ldf .",
    "five zenith angle bins are considered separately to reduce the dependence on the inclination and to focus on the effects connected to the depth of shower maximum of the showers .",
    "these zenith angle bins are chosen such that they cover the same solid angle .",
    ", simulated once as proton ( blue ) , once as iron ( light - red ) primaries .",
    "the dotted line represents the distance d@xmath14 at which the rms - spread of the fitted normalized amplitudes is minimal.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we first investigate the slope method using the coreas simulations of the lopes events .",
    "the procedure aims to compare the ldf of several events with different primary energies and arrival directions , thus normalizations for the radio amplitudes are required . with the well - founded assumption that the leading contribution to the radio emission from air showers is of geomagnetic origin ( @xmath15  85  % ) @xcite , the east - west channel amplitudes for each given event are corrected for @xmath16 , the east - west component of the lorentz vector ( @xmath17 ) , with @xmath18 the arrival direction and @xmath19 the geomagnetic field vector .",
    "( due to detection threshold effects , there are no events in the lopes data set with a shower axis parallel to the magnetic field ; the smallest geomagnetic angle is 15@xmath20 , corresponding to a @xmath21 of 0.26 , whereas the mean @xmath21 is 0.7 . ) in addition , we normalize the electric field amplitudes by the monte carlo true energy of each event , which has been adopted as the energy reconstructed by kascade(-grande ) for the underlying lopes event .",
    "the normalized lateral distribution function fits for the events in the first zenith angle bin ( zenith@xmath919.4@xmath4 ) are presented here as an example ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ldfe ] ) .",
    "this figure already illustrates that the spread of the obtained radio ldf fits drastically varies as a function of the distance from the shower axis .",
    "the spread is quantified in fig .",
    "[ fig_rmsldfall ] , where the profile of the relative rms - spread for the ldf fits is shown for each of the zenith angle bins .",
    "the spread reaches from @xmath22  % at distances of 70 - 100  m from the shower axis up to more than 50  % at distances larger than 300  m. simulations @xcite previously predicted the existence of a peculiar distance ( d@xmath14 ) where the radio amplitudes do not carry information on x@xmath0 and the influence of shower - to - shower fluctuations is minimal . also here",
    ", we observe the minimum spread of the ldf fits at a peculiar distance d@xmath14 .",

    "we first `` calibrate '' the relation of this slope with the depth of shower maximum on the basis of coreas simulations .",
    "afterwards , we apply the found relation to lopes measurements .",
    "we define the ldf slope @xmath24 as the ratio of the radio amplitudes taken at the distance d@xmath14 and at the fixed distance of 200  m ( @xmath24=@xmath25/@xmath26 ) .",
    "the latter value is chosen for the specific investigation on the lopes events , since 200  m is a relatively large distance but is still in the range of the measurements .",
    "the x@xmath0 values for each event are taken directly from the monte carlo simulations , and are considered as the `` true '' values .",
    "the ratio of the radio amplitudes and the depth of the shower maximum are plotted against each other in fig .",

    "the function ( eq .  [ xm_eq ] ) appropriately describes the correlation for the events simulated with coreas , and it is adequate for all of the zenith bins .",
    "the @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 parameters , including the statistical uncertainties of the fit , are extracted separately for each zenith angle bin ( table [ xmax_sel2 ] ) , and the corresponding fit results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_xmaxfits ] .",
    "this function has not been optimized for minimal correlation between fit parameters , which can lead to comparably good fits with more than one set of parameters , visible as fluctuations in the derived parameter values in table [ xmax_sel2 ] .",
    "this is fine as long as the resulting fits describe the distribution of data points correctly , which they do .",
    "however , in the future it would be worth investigating better fit functions with minimally correlated fit parameters , ideally parameters that can be associated directly with physical parameters of the underlying air shower . to improve the determination of the three fitting parameters and to better constrain the fit over a wide range of x@xmath0 values , increased ( doubled ) statistics for the proton- and",
    "iron - simulated showers are used .",
    "we performed the fit procedure for all zenith angle bins both without and with associating an uncertainty propagated from the ldf fits to the individual data points , and the results vary only insignificantly . propagating the resulting fit uncertainties into an uncertainty for the reconstructed x@xmath0 values",
    "can not be achieved by gaussian error propagation due to the non - linear nature of the problem .",
    "one option to proceed would be to employ an involved procedure for the estimation of the uncertainty of the reconstructed x@xmath0 values , e.g.  by bootstrapping methods . as we want to keep our analysis practical and",
    "are anyway limited by the lack of an independent x@xmath0 determination to compare the reconstructed values with , however , we choose instead to use the resulting spread in the distribution around the fit as an estimate for the uncertainty of the reconstructed x@xmath0 values .    in other words ,",
    "we calculate the typical x@xmath0 precision of the slope method as the spread of the difference between the true monte carlo x@xmath0 values and the x@xmath0 values reconstructed using the slope method on coreas simulations . fig .",

    "for the coreas simulated events with doubled statistics , and considering the complete zenith angle range , the rms - spread is in the range of 45 - 65  g/@xmath1 .",
    "it is important to note that the results presented here apply to the specific situation of lopes , in particular the altitude of the lopes site , the specific observing frequency band used @xcite , the energy range probed , and the dimension of the antenna array .",
    "these parameters all affect the amplitude ratio and consequently play a role in the determination of the x@xmath0 calibration curves . indeed , for inclined showers",
    ", larger amplitude ratios may be obtained when the far - away distance used to calculate the ratio is taken well beyond the 200  m distance used for this analysis and imposed , here , by the dimension of the lopes array .",

[ xm_eq ] ) is now applied to reconstruct the x@xmath0 values from lopes measurements , using the coreas - derived @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 parameters listed in table [ xmax_sel2 ] for the appropriate zenith angle bin of each individual event .    in fig .",

    "the standard deviation value for the lopes distribution of @xmath895  g/@xmath1 can be considered itself as an upper - limit for the lopes precision on x@xmath0 , although it does not explicitly account for systematic uncertainties , e.g. , scale uncertainties due to modelling the atmosphere or due to hadronic interaction models used for the shower simulations .",

    "the solid lines represent the monte carlo expectations for qgsjetii-03 for pure iron - simulated ( red ) and pure proton - simulated showers .",
    "the uncertainty indicated in this figure on the lopes average x@xmath0 values is the statistical uncertainty , i.e.  standard deviation/@xmath37 .",
    "the intrinsic uncertainty of the slope method , as determined by the spread between the reconstructed and monte carlo true values , is indicated as a shaded band .",
    "no additional analysis on the systematics is carried out .    in summary ,",
    "the results of the lopes x@xmath0 determination are self - consistent and plausible .",
    "nevertheless , we point out that the lopes uncertainties are too large for any conclusion concerning the mass composition .",
    "in the following discussion , willful and imposed limitations which had influence on the slope method analysis of the lopes simulated and measured events are pointed out .    the upper limit on the observed energy precision ( @xmath8  20 - 25  % ) includes the convolution of both the lopes and kascade - grande ( particle detector ) uncertainties . the good compatibility with the kascade - grande statistical uncertainty ( approx .  20  % )",
    "indicates that the combined uncertainty of the energy is strongly influenced by kascade - grande and that the energy resolution of lopes is likely significantly better than 20 - 25  % .",
    "the total energy precision of the slope method suggested by the pure coreas simulations is approximately 13  % and could potentially be achieved by applying the method on low - noise radio data .",
    "it is worth stressing once again that radio emission is purely sensitive to the electromagnetic component of air showers .",
    "if combined with other detection techniques which are able to provide information on other components , in particular the muonic one , radio detection can help to disentangle the individual components , which in itself opens access to composition - sensitive information .",
    "moreover , the radio signals are not critically affected by uncertainties in the hadronic interaction models used to understand the data .    one restriction of the analysis presented here concerns the deliberate exclusion of the detector - simulation in the investigation .",
    "a more realistic comparison with the measurements may include both simulations of detector properties as well as simulated continuous and transient noise typical of the specific experimental site .",
    "also , we did not try to apply a more sophisticated normalization of the radio field strengths including a charge - excess component . since we fit a one - dimensional ldf with observers at various azimuth angles , the charge - excess asymmetry mostly averages out in the ldf fit .",
    "we confirmed with a dedicated simulation study that the additional spread introduced by this simplified treatment is negligible and that there is a bias in the reconstructed @xmath38-parameters of less than 5% , which is much smaller than the overall calibration scale uncertainty of 35% and for which we account with an additional systematic uncertainty of 5% . for experiments with better data quality than lopes ,",
    "however , methods should be investigated to try and correct individual measured amplitudes by the presumed charge - excess contribution or fit two - dimenaional ldf functions to improve the fit and thus possibly the energy determination .",
    "this aspect was not investigated since the precision we achieve in the combined analysis anyway seems to be limited by the reference energy provided by kascade - grande and not by our method .",
    "the qgsjet  ii.03 interaction model was employed to generate the coreas simulations of the lopes events .",
    "other interaction models are available and they differ both in their implementation and their predictions .",
    "we used the slope method to show how air shower parameters such as energy and x@xmath0 can be directly derived from the features of the radio ldf . regarding the energy reconstruction ,",
    "different interaction models predict different fractions of the energy going into the electromagnetic component and other components , respectively .",
    "this might lead to more significant shifts between the radio amplitudes observed for different primaries of the same energy than illustrated in this analysis .",
    "such shifts , however , are not a disadvantage of radio detection , since in fact radio emission with its sensitivity to the pure electromagnetic component of the air shower could be used to study such effects and test hadronic interaction models . regarding the shower evolution",
    ", different interaction models will make different predictions for the x@xmath0 values of air showers initiated by specific primaries with given energies .",
    "however , the obtained `` calibration '' relating a given value of x@xmath0 to a corresponding radio ldf slope should not be strongly affected by the choice of interaction model .",
    "this is because the slope method exploits an intrinsic property of the radio emission : the relation between the geometrical distance of the radio source and the slope of the radio lateral distribution arising from the forward - beaming of the emission .",
    "a slight influence on the calibration curve can be expected by variations of the atmosphere , which relate the geometrical distance to the depth of shower maximum in g/@xmath1 . within the precision achievable by lopes ,",
    "however , these effects can be neglected .",
    "the x@xmath0 resolution obtained in this analysis ( @xmath895  g/@xmath1 ) is an upper - limit attained with ( lopes ) radio data affected by strong environmental noise .",
    "much better results may be achieved by using higher quality radio measurements and a denser antenna array .",
    "such is the case for lofar @xcite , which has recently applied a method based on global fits of the two - dimensional radio ldf and obtained a sensitivity in x@xmath0 comparable with the fluorescence technique ( @xmath820  g/@xmath1 ) .",
    "the underlying principle is the same , namely the exploitation of the geometrical connection between the source distance and the radio ldf described above .    in the analysis presented here , we strove to exploit the potential of the lopes data while at the same time keeping the analysis practical . existing and upcoming more modern experiments such as aera @xcite , tunka - rex @xcite and lofar @xcite will have higher - quality data with lower background noise , a larger number of antennas per event and a larger range of lateral distances probed with each event .",
    "the methods presented here will have to be refined to achieve the maximum precision these instruments will be able to deliver in energy and x@xmath0 resolution . in particular , a lateral distribution function accounting for the asymmetries induced by the charge - excess should be used .",
    "the function used to fit the x@xmath0 values as a function of amplitude ratios should be re - investigated and correlations between fit parameters should be minimized .",
    "finally , a more sophisticated determination of the reconstruction uncertainties , taking into account the non - gaussian error propagation should be applied . in spite of these limitations",
    ", we have demonstrated that a determination of the energy and x@xmath0 from the radio lateral distribution is feasible with promising upper limits on the achievable precision .",
    "the purpose of this analysis was the reconstruction of the energy and depth of shower maximum of individual cosmic rays from radio measurements performed with the lopes experiment .",
    "we achieved this goal by exploiting characteristic features of the lateral distribution function of the radio emission , in particular its slope .",
    "we have developed and applied a coreas - calibrated method to the measurements of the lopes experiment .",
    "significant results emerged :    * a characteristic distance from the shower axis , i.e. d@xmath14 ( 70100  m ) , is predicted by coreas simulations of the lopes events to be the appropriate place for the primary energy investigation with radio data .",
    "its existence is also indicated in lopes measurements . *",
    "a simple linear correlation between the radio amplitude measured at the distance d@xmath14 and the kascade - grande reconstructed energy was found .",
    "a zenith - angle dependent deviation in the correlation parameters remains between coreas simulations and lopes data ; this discrepancy needs to be investigated in a dedicated analysis . *",
    "an upper - limit for the lopes precision on the total energy reconstruction was determined from the combined lopes ",
    "kascade - grande energy uncertainty ( @xmath820 - 25% depending on zenith angle ) .",
    "the intrinsic energy resolution of the radio measurements suggested by the simulations is approximately @xmath39 , and might even be improved by taking the askaryan effect explicitly into accout in the ldf fits .",
    "however , any further improvment is beyond the testing power of lopes . * the slope of the lopes lateral distribution function",
    "was exploited to reconstruct x@xmath0 from lopes data .",
    "the resulting distributions are plausible and comparable with expectations from cosmic ray nuclei . * by itself , and for the specific situation of lopes , the slope method predicted a precision of x@xmath0 around 50  g/@xmath1 , depending on the zenith angle of the event . from the analysis of the lopes measurements , an upper limit of @xmath895  g/@xmath1 on the precision was found .",
    "x@xmath0 is the principle indicator for cosmic ray composition , and we have demonstrated the possibility to reconstruct it with the slope method applied to lopes radio measurements .",
    "the importance of this result is underlined by the fact that radio detection does not suffer from low duty cycles as is the case for optical detection techniques .",
    "comparisons of the reconstructed x@xmath0 values between , at least , two different detection methods are essential but not possible in the framework of the lopes and kascade - grande experiments .",
    "this opportunity is offered by the new generation of antenna arrays , such as aera @xcite ( at the pierre auger observatory ) and tunka - rex @xcite , where the radio reconstruction can be cross checked with the fluorescence and cherenkov experimental results , respectively .",
