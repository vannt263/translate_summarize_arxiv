    "a result of this work is that there is a simple and illuminating formula for the rate .",
    "there is a quantity @xmath2 , given by the flux of the surrounding particles or excitations , and the @xmath3 matrix for the interaction of our system ( e.g. the chiral molecule ) with these surroundings :    @xmath4    the imaginary part gives the rate or loss of phase coherence per unit time @xmath5 :    @xmath6    ( the real part also has a significance , a level shift induced by the surroundings .",
    "this turns out to be a neat way to find the index of refraction formula for a particle in a medium @xcite . )    the labels ( l , r ) on the @xmath3 refer to which state of the molecule ( or other system )",
    "is doing the interacting with the surroundings . here with ( l , r ) we have taken the case of the simplest non - trivial system , the two - level system .",
    "these equations may be derived@xcite by thinking of the s - matrix as the operator which transforms the initial state of an incoming object into the final state . if the different states ( l , r ) of our system scatter the object differently , a `` lack of overlap '' or `` unitarity deficit '' as given by eq  [ [ lam ] ] arises .",
    "these intuitive arguments can also supported by more formal manipulations  @xcite .",
    "an important point that we see here , in eq  [ [ lam ] ] , is that the environment `` chooses a direction in hilbert space''@xcite .",
    "that is , there is some direction ( here l , r ) in the internal space of the system under study ( the molecule ) that is left unchanged  is not `` flipped'' by the interaction with the surroundings .",
    "such states however get a phase factor by the interaction , and this is the .",
    "if the interaction did not distinguish some direction , if we had @xmath7 then the formula tells us there would be no .",
    "this is intuitively correct in accord with one s ideas about `` measurement '' .",
    "if the probe does not distinguish any state there are no `` wavefunction collapses '' and no takes place .",
    "( this is not meant to imply sanctioning of `` wavefunction collapses '' in any way . )",
    "another simple limit for the formula occurs when only one state interacts , say no interaction for l , or @xmath8 .",
    "then one finds that the rate is 1/2 the scattering rate for the interacting component  @xcite .",
    "thus eqs  [ [ lam],[d ] ] have two interesting limits :    @xmath9    and @xmath10    the latter followed from an application of the optical theorem . with appropriate evaluation of the s - matrices , eqs  [ [ lam],[d ] ] can be applied to many types of problems , like quantum dots  @xcite or neutrinos  @xcite , or even gravity  @xcite .",
    "eq  [ [ no ] ] is quite interesting in that it says the system can interact but nevertheless retain its internal coherence .",
    "a lesson here is that one should nt think that every interaction or disturbance `` decoheres '' or `` reduces '' the system .",
    "the system can interact quite a bit as long as the interactions do nt distinguish the different internal states .",
    "the fact that the interaction responsible for the must `` choose a direction in hilbert space '' has some interesting implications .",
    "one of these has to do with the of a free particle in some background environment .",
    "eq  [ [ lam ] ] was for a two - state system , and the extension to a larger number of states , as long as it is a finite number , can be easily envisioned as following the logic@xcite used in finding eq  [ [ lam ] ] .",
    "however if we go to the continuum , that is if we have a infinite number of states , the problem becomes more subtle .",
    "the most common example of this is the free particle which , say in the limit of an infinitely large `` box '' , is described as system of continuous , dense , levels .",
    "a number of authors , in talking about this system , have automatically assumed , as indeed first seems plausible , that at long times the particle under the influence of some continually interacting environment becomes totally `` decohered '' ; in the sense that the density matrix of the particle @xmath11 approaches the situation of no off - diagonal elements , that @xmath12 approaches a @xmath13 function .",
    "although this may seem plausible , that under the repeated bombardment by the surroundings the particle becomes more and more `` decohered '' , it is in fact wrong    @xmath14    consider the simplest case , that of a thermal environment . on general grounds we expect the particle in a thermal environment to be described by the boltzmann factor , to be given by a density matrix operator @xmath15 , where t is the temperature and h the hamiltonian , say @xmath16 for a non - relativistic particle .",
    "now evaluate this operator in the position representation :    @xmath17    this is the stationary , long time value of @xmath12 .",
    "it applies for nearly any state we care to initially throw into the medium .",
    "evidently it shows no signs of changing and certainly no sign of turning into a @xmath18 function .",
    "of course at high temperature our expression will resemble a delta function .",
    "the practical importance of this will depend on the other length scales in the problem at hand .",
    "the point we wish to make , however , is of a conceptual nature , namely that repeated interactions with the environment do nt necessarily lead to more `` decoherence '' .",
    "indeed eq  [ [ boltz ] ] says if we were initially to put @xmath19 or some other `` highly incoherent '' density matrix into the medium , the density matrix of the particle would become _ more coherent _",
    "with time until it reached the value eq  [ [ boltz ] ] .",
    "apparently the medium can `` give coherence '' to a state that never had any to start with .",
    "`` creating coherence '' by an outside influence is not as mysterious as it may sound , there are familiar cases where we know this already .",
    "for example , using a high resolution detector can `` create a long wavepacket ''  @xcite or in particle physics neutral @xmath0 oscillations and the like may be enhanced or `` created '' by using some subset of our total event sample , such as a `` flavor tag '' .",
    "where did the seemingly plausible argument or feeling about the indefinitely increasing go wrong ?",
    "it s the question of the `` direction chosen in hilbert space '' .",
    "the feeling is right , but we must know where to apply it . as we can see from the boltzmann factor , thermodynamics likes to work in momentum ( actually energy ) space . the intuition would have been right there , in momentum space but this then means something non - trivial in position space .",
    "the lesson here is that the notion of `` by the environment '' must be understood to include a statement about the `` direction chosen in hilbert space '' by that environment  @xcite .",
    "the interest in these issues has had a revival with the advances made possible by the technologies of mesoscopic systems .",
    "in one such system , the `` quantum dot observed by the qpc '' , one has a complete model of the measurement process , including the `` observer '' , `` who '' in this case is a quantum point contact ( qpc )  @xcite . in a slight generalization of the original experiment  @xcite one",
    "can see how not only the density matrix of the object being observed is `` reduced '' by the observing process , but also see how the readout current  the `` observer '' responds . in particular",
    "one may see how effects looking very much like the `` collapse of the wavefunction '' , that is sequences of repeated or `` telegraphic '' signals indicating one or another of the two states of the quantum dot , arise .",
    "all this without putting in any `` collapses '' by hand  @xcite .",
    "we should stress that what we are not only talking about a reduction of fringe contrast due to `` observing '' or disturbing an interference experiment , as in  @xcite ; and also in interesting experiments in quantum optics where an environment is simulated  @xcite or different branches of the interferometer  @xcite interact differently and adjustably with the radiation in a cavity ( like our two s - matrices ) . by the `` collapses '' however",
    ", we are referring not so much to the interferometer itself as to the signal from some `` observing '' system , like the current in the qpc . with repeated probing of the _ same _ object ( say electron or atom ) , in the limit of strong `` observation '' this signal repeats itself -this is the `` collapse '' . for not too strong observation",
    "there is an intermediate character of the signal , and so on .",
    "all this may be understood by considering the amplitude for the interference arrangement and the readout procedure to give a certain result  @xcite .",
    "the properties of the readout signal naturally stand in some relation to the loss of coherence or `` fringe contrast '' of the interference effect under study .    following this line of thought we come to the idea that there should be some relation between the fluctuations of a readout signal and decoherence .",
    "indeed the decoherence rate , the imaginary part of eq  [ [ lam ] ] is a dissipative parameter in some sense ; it characterizes the rate of loss of coherence .",
    "now there is the famous `` dissipation- fluctuation theorem '' , which says that dissipative parameters are related to fluctuations in the system .",
    "is there some such relationship here ? indeed , one is able to derive a relation between the fluctuations of the readout current and the value of @xmath5@xcite .",
    "the interesting and perhaps practical lesson here is that the parameter can be observed in two ways .",
    "one is the direct way , just observe the damping out of the coherent oscillations of the system in question .",
    "experimentally , this involves starting the system in a definite , selected state .",
    "however , as just explained , there is a second way ; namely observe the fluctuations of the readout .",
    "this can be done even if the system is in the totally `` decohered '' @xmath20 state .",
    "another mesoscopic system , the squid and in particular the rf squid , has been long discussed@xcite as a candidate for showing that even macroscopic objects are subject to the rules of quantum mechanics . the rf squid , a josephson device where a supercurrent goes around a ring , can have two distinct states , right- or left- circulation of the current .",
    "these two conditions apparently differ greatly , since a macroscopic number of electrons change direction .",
    "it would be a powerful argument for the universality of the quantum rules if one could demonstrate the meaningfulness of quantum linear combinations of these two states .",
    "such linear combinations can in principle be produced since there is some amplitude for a tunneling between the two configurations .",
    "in fact this was recently manifested through the observation of the `` repulsion of levels '' to be anticipated if the configurations of opposite current do behave as quantum states@xcite .",
    "another approach , where we would directly `` see '' the meaningfulness of the relative quantum phase of the two configurations , is the method of `` adiabatic inversion ''  @xcite .",
    "this method also offers the possibility of a direct measurement of the time . in adiabatic inversion the `` spin '' representing a two - level system  @xcite ,  @xcite is made to `` follow '' a slowly moving `` magnetic field '' ( meant symbolically , as an analogy to spin precession physics ) , which is swept from `` up '' to `` down '' . in this way the system can be made to invert its direction in `` spin space '' , that is to reverse states and go from one direction of circulation of the current to the other .",
    "this inversion is an intrinsically quantum phenomenon .",
    "if it occurs it shows that the phases between the two configurations were physically meaningful and that they behave quantum mechanically .",
    "this may be dramatically manifested if we let destroy the phase relation between the two configurations .",
    "now the configurations act classically and the inversion is blocked .",
    "we thus predict that when the rate is low the inversion takes place , and when it is high it does not .",
    "figs 1 and 2 show the idea of this procedure .",
    ".3 cm    since in such an experiment we have the sweep speed at our disposal , we have a way of determining the time .",
    "it is simply the slowest sweep time for which the inversion is successful .",
    "we must only be sure that for the sweep speeds in question the the conditions remain adiabatic .",
    "setting up the adiabatic condition and taking some estimates for the time , it appears that the various requirements can be met  @xcite ,  @xcite when operating at low temperature .",
    "hence it may be realistically possible to move between the classical and quantum mechanical worlds  to turn quantum mechanics `` on and off '' in one experiment",
    ". this would be a beautiful experiment , the main open question being if the estimates of the rate are in fact realistic , since we are entering a realm which has not been explored before .",
    "a two - state system behaving quantum mechanically can serve as the physical embodiment of a quantum mechanical bit , the `` qbit '' . furthermore , the adiabatic inversion procedure just described amounts to a quantum realization of one of the basic elements of computer logic : the not .",
    "if one configuration is identified as 1 and the other as 0 , then the inversion turns a linear combination of 1 and 0 into a linear combination of 0 and 1 with reversed weights .    we can try to push this idea of `` adiabatic logic '' a step further .",
    "not was a one bit operation .",
    "the next most complicated logic operation is a two bit operation , which we may take to be `` controlled not '' or cnot . in cnot",
    "the two bits are called the control bit and the target bit , and the operation consists of performing or not performing a not on the target bit , according to the state of the control bit .    to realize cnot , an idea which suggests itself  @xcite as a generalization of adiabatic inversion is the following .",
    "we have a two bit operation and so two squids .",
    "these are devices with magnetic fields .",
    "now if one squid , the target bit , is undergoing a not operation , it can be influenced by the control bit , a second nearby squid , through its linking flux .",
    "we could imagine that this linking flux can be arranged so that it helps or hinders the not operation according to the state of the second squid .",
    "this would amount to a realization of `` controlled not '' , again by means of an adiabatic sweep .    to analyze this proposal",
    "we must set up the two - variable schroedinger equation describing the two devices and their interaction .",
    "the result is a hamiltonian with the usual kinetic energy terms and a potential energy term in the two variables , which in this case are the fluxes in the squids , @xmath21 :    @xmath22+\\beta_1f(\\phi_1)+\\beta_2f(\\phi_2 ) \\bigr\\ } \\ ; .\\ ] ]    the @xmath23 are external biases which in general will be time varying .",
    "the @xmath24 are dimensionless inductances and @xmath25 represents the coupling between the two devices .",
    "the @xmath26 are symmetric functions starting at one and decreasing with increasing @xmath27 so as to produce a double well potential when combined with the quadratic term ; in the squid @xmath28 .",
    "3 shows this `` potential landscape '' for some typical values of the parameters .",
    "given the hamiltonian , we must search for values of the control parameters @xmath23 , the `` external fields '' , which can be adiabatically varied in such a way as to produce cnot .",
    "preliminary analysis indicates favorable regimes of the rather complex parameter space where this can in fact be done  @xcite .",
    "finally we would like to recall that there are still some fundamental and beautiful experiments waiting to be done in these areas .",
    "\\a ) one is the demonstration of the large effects of parity violation for appropriately chosen and contained handed molecules  @xcite . because of what we now call this seemed very remote at the time .",
    "but now with the existence of single atom / molecule traps and related techniques , perhaps it s not so hopeless .",
    "\\b ) another , concerned with fundamentals of quantum mechanics , could be called the `` adjustable collapse of the wavefunction '' where the `` strength of observing '' can be varied , leading to effects like washing out of interferences , as already seen in @xcite and a number of further predictions where we vary the qualities of the `` observer '' @xcite , or slowing down of relaxation according to the rate of probing of the object  @xcite .",
    "many of the questions we have briefly touched upon had their origins in an unease with certain consequences of quantum mechanics , often as `` paradoxes '' and `` puzzles '' .",
    "it is amusing to see how , as we get used to them , the `` paradoxes '' fade and yield to a more concrete understanding , sometimes even with consequences for practical physics or engineering . if we avoid overselling and some tendency to an inflation of vocabulary , we can anticipate a bright and interesting future for `` applied fundamentals of quantum mechanics '' .      on the time dependence of optical activity , r.a .",
