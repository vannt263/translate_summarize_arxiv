    "there is now ample evidence from both observations and numerical simulations for the multi - dimensional nature of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the high - velocity `` jets '' of sulfur - rich material - which presumably originated deep in the stellar mantle - seen in the supernova remnant cassiopeia a @xcite , the double - peaked structure of the oxygen and magnesium nebular lines in observations of sn 2003jd @xcite , and the spectropolarimetric observations of stripped - envelope core - collapse supernovae @xcite can all be explained if the explosions were aspherical .",
    "asphericity in the hydrodynamical simulations of core collapse supernovae is seen to emerge even when the progenitor is spherically symmetric @xcite .",
    "if the asphericity is indeed generated deep with the star during the earliest epochs of the explosion then one would naturally expect the generation of turbulence in the fluid .",
    "the turbulence , which some have argued is crucial for achieving an explosion @xcite , would , in turn , alter the flavor evolution of neutrinos racing through the stellar mantle from the cooling proto - neutron star formed at the core .    finding the consequence of the turbulence upon the neutrinos is vital for interpreting the signal from the next supernova in the galaxy .",
    "this need has long been recognized and various authors have examined the effect of turbulence upon neutrinos @xcite . from these studies",
    "it has emerged that turbulence can affect the neutrinos in two different ways .",
    "the first , more direct effect of the turbulence is to ` stimulate ' transitions between the instantaneous neutrino eigenstates @xcite while the neutrino is propagating through the turbulent region . although this effect depends upon a number of factors , typically noticeable turbulence effects require the density fluctuations to be present in the region of the supernovae mantle where neutrinos experience the mikheyev , smirnov and wolfenstein ( msw ) resonances and their amplitude must be of order a few percent .",
    "that said , the description of the stimulated transition effect of turbulence is not in terms of msw resonances and msw resonances are not required for the effect to appear .",
    "the second , more subtle effect of turbulence occurs when the neutrino transition probabilities exhibit phase effects @xcite . in order to observe phase effects and this second , indirect , sensitivity to turbulence we require at least two semi - adiabatic msw resonances and/or density discontinuities in the profile .",
    "even then , it is sometimes possible to reduce the imprint of this second effect by carefully selecting the profile and neutrino energy . in more general circumstances we find both effects simultaneously though the second effect of turbulence becomes most obvious when the amplitude is small because the direct effect is usually negligible in this limit @xcite .    while the basic effects of turbulence upon the neutrinos have been determined , it is not apparent to what extent they might operate in a supernova due to the lack of suitable three - dimensional , high resolution , long duration hydrodynamical simulations . in their absence authors",
    "have been forced to model the turbulence in a supernova by adopting a turbulence - free profile and then inserting turbulence into it in the form of a random field with assumed properties .",
    "the problem with this approach is that the validity of these prescriptions for the turbulence in supernovae are unknown .",
    "that situation changed recently with the study by borriello _",
    "_ @xcite of the turbulence in a two - dimensional simulation from kifonidis _ et al . _ which approached the necessary resolution and duration",
    ". borriello _",
    "_ fitted the power spectrum for the turbulence along each radial sliceof the simulation with a broken inverse - power law defined by four parameters .",
    "two of these parameters correspond to spectral indices which they called @xmath1 and @xmath2 : @xmath3 is the index for the longer wavelengths and the other , @xmath2 , for the shorter .",
    "the other two parameters are the amplitude and the break wavenumber defined in terms of a multiple of the long wavelength cutoff scale . the short wavelength index was found to have a mean and @xmath4 error of around @xmath5 while the index for the longer wavelengths was found to have a mean and @xmath4 error of @xmath6 .",
    "the analysis by borriello _",
    "is a welcome addition to the literature but the well - known differences between the properties of turbulence in two and three spatial dimensions means it is not clear which results can be safely carried over to 3d .",
    "for example , in the inertial range of wavenumbers for 2d turbulence one may observe a kraichnan inverse enstrophy cascade which funnels turbulent power into the long wavelength modes , a kolmogorov energy cascade in the opposite direction , and even double cascades @xcite where turbulence is injected at some given scale and cascades to both longer _ and _ shorter wavelengths .",
    "the turbulence seen by borriello _",
    "et al . _ appears to be of this double cascade type because they find broken power laws similar to a nastrom - gage spectrum @xcite .",
    "if the presence of the ` break wavenumber ' and a short wavelength index @xmath2 is due to the 2d nature of the turbulence and if the amplitude they obtain is similarly contaminated by the inverse cascade effect , this leaves , perhaps , just the long wavelength index @xmath3 as being transferable to a 3d study .",
    "thus , the most conservative conclusion to draw from the study is that the long wavelength spectral index has a mean of @xmath7 and the fact it has a range appears to indicate the turbulence is also not always ` fully developed ' justifying the exploration of something other than a kolmogorov , @xmath0 , power spectrum in the prescriptions for turbulence in 3d which has heretofore been the default .",
    "changing the power spectrum will alter the evolution of individual neutrinos passing through the turbulence and the correlation between pairs of neutrinos sent along parallel rays @xcite .",
    "the analytic results of friedland & gruzinov @xcite and patton , kneller & mclaughlin @xcite can be used to predict the effect of changing the spectral index for the direct , stimulated transition , effect of turbulence .",
    "they indicate that a lowering of the index ( hardening ) of the power spectrum should increase the stimulated transition effect upon the neutrinos by i ) increasing the amplitude of the turbulence modes which lead to transitions between the neutrino states , ii ) permitting more combinations of modes to drive transitions without a severe simultaneous narrowing of the resonance , and iii ) lowering the amplitude of the modes which suppress those transitions .",
    "however the precise amount by which the direct turbulence effect alters the neutrino transition properties as the power spectrum changes has not been determined , and nothing exists in the literature for the indirect turbulence effect of distorted phase .",
    "it is the filling of these holes which is the goal of this paper .",
    "we begin by describing the calculations we have performed paying particular attention to the turbulence power spectrum we use and other details .",
    "the section following demonstrates the two effects of turbulence and the two descriptions which we shall use to make predictions and understand our results .",
    "our results for the change in the ensembles for single neutrinos at three different energies and a wide range of turbulence amplitudes as a function of the power spectral index are then presented and we finish with a summary and our conclusions where we attempt to construct a coherent description of turbulence effects in supernova neutrinos .",
    "in order to study the effect of the supernova turbulence upon the neutrinos we compute the set of probabilities that a neutrino initially in some state @xmath8 is later detected in some other state @xmath9 at a different location - the transition probabilities .",
    "these quantities are denoted as @xmath10 for neutrinos and @xmath11 for the antineutrinos .",
    "the transition probabilities can be computed from the elements of the evolution matrix @xmath12 which links the initial and final neutrino states , that is @xmath13 , and the evolution matrix is computed by solving the schrodinger equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the hamiltonian and @xmath16 the affine parameter along the neutrino trajectory .",
    "the transition probabilities we report in this paper are for the ` matter ' basis states .",
    "the matter basis states are related to the flavor basis states by the matter mixing matrix @xmath17 which is defined so that the flavor basis hamiltonian @xmath18 and its eigenvalue matrix @xmath19 are related via @xmath20 @xcite . in our case",
    "the hamiltonian possesses two contributions : the first , @xmath21 , is from the vacuum and the second , @xmath22 comes from the effect of the matter upon the neutrino .",
    "we do not include the contribution to @xmath15 from ` collective ' effects : see duan , fuller & qian @xcite for a review of this fascinating subject .",
    "the vacuum hamiltonian for a neutrino of a given energy @xmath23 is defined by the two independent mass squared differences @xmath24 of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it is diagonal in the ` mass ' basis which is related to the flavor basis by the maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo @xcite unitary ` mixing ' matrix @xmath27 .",
    "the mixing matrix can be written in terms of three vacuum mixing angles , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , a cp phase @xmath31 , and two majorana phases though the two majorana phases do not influence the evolution @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt numerical values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( a normal hierarchy ) , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 which are consistent with the values from the particle data group @xcite .",
    "the cp phase is set to zero .",
    "the msw potential @xmath22 is diagonal in the flavor basis because matter interacts with neutrinos based on their flavor .",
    "the matter affects the neutrinos via both neutral and charged current channels but the neutral current contribution to @xmath22 may be ignored because it leads to an unobservable global phase .",
    "in contrast , the absence of mu and tau leptons in the matter means the charged current potential affects the electron flavor neutrino and antineutrinos only .",
    "the charged current potential for the electron flavor neutrinos and antineutrinos is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fermi constant and @xmath39 the electron density .",
    "the plus sign applies to the electron neutrinos , the minus sign for the electron antineutrinos .",
    "this potential is the ` ee ' element of @xmath22 .",
    "the tiny radiative @xmath40 potential @xcite is ignored since it is a factor of @xmath41 smaller than the potential affecting the electron flavor in the standard model ( but may be two or three orders of magnitude bigger if supersymmetric contributions are included @xcite ) .",
    "it is through the electron density @xmath39 that the turbulence enters @xmath22 .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the ideal would be to use density profiles taken from high resolution , long duration , three - dimensional simulations of supernovae in order to study the effect of turbulence .",
    "these are not available so one is forced to adopt a profile from a one - dimensional simulation and add turbulence to it .",
    "we shall introduce the turbulence in such a way that the profile from the 1d simulation is also the mean electron density @xmath42 , the average here being over realizations of the turbulence .",

    "[ fig : profile ] ]    the profile we use for @xmath42 is the @xmath54 postbounce snapshot from the @xmath55 simulation by fischer _",
    "the msw potential for this profile is shown in figure ( [ fig : profile ] ) and was chosen so that neutrinos with the msw resonance of the three energies we shall use throughout this paper , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , intersect the profile in the region where we shall place the turbulence .",
    "as we shall discover , these energies are representative in the sense that each will be affected by the turbulence to differing degrees because the region where we place the turbulence will have a different relation to the msw densities of these three neutrino energies .",
    "since we are considering different neutrino energies it is not necessary for us to consider snapshots at other epochs from this simulation because , to first order , the profile epoch and the neutrino energy are degenerate : what occurs to lower energy neutrinos at early times will occur for higher energies at later times . for this profile",
    "we may regard the @xmath58 neutrinos as representing what we expect at the epoch when turbulence is just beginning to affect the neutrinos of a given energy , the @xmath57 as representing the effect when the h resonant channel is strongly affected , and the @xmath56 neutrinos as representing what we expect when the turbulence begins to affect both h and l resonant channels .",
    "fixing the neutrino energy and changing the snapshot time would be an alternative way to explore this dependence between the turbulence effects and msw densities . also , the actual shape of the underlying one - dimensional profile is not very important to the turbulence effects so changing the simulation will not lead to qualitatively different results - the reader is referred to lund & kneller @xcite where turbulence was put into this same @xmath43 simulation from fischer _ et al .",
    "_ at multiple post - bounce epochs and compared with results for turbulence inserted into two other two simulations , a @xmath59 and a @xmath60 , by the same authors .",
    "returning to figure ( [ fig : profile ] ) , the reader will observe there are three discontinuities within the profile : the reverse shock at @xmath44 , the contact discontinuity at @xmath45 and the forward shock at @xmath61 .",
    "these features were steepened by hand from the original simulation data : see lund & kneller @xcite for a discussion of why this steepening was necessary .",
    "the evolution of neutrinos and antineutrinos with energies @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 and the given set of mixing parameters through the base profile are shown in figure ( [ fig : pevolution ] ) .",
    "for the neutrinos the mixing between @xmath62 and @xmath63 dominates and note that the sudden discontinuities in the transition probability @xmath64 occur at the discontinuities in the profile and not at the msw resonances ( unless the two coincide ) . for @xmath56 neutrinos there is a noticeable change in both @xmath65 and @xmath66 at the forward shock ; for the @xmath57 the change in the same probabilities at the same location is much smaller and by @xmath58 the change in @xmath65 and @xmath66 are minuscule . in the antineutrinos",
    "we again see a noticeable jump in @xmath67 at the forward shock of similar size to the change of @xmath65 for neutrinos of the same energy while the jump in @xmath67 at higher energies is much smaller ; any jump in @xmath68 is very small at all antineutrino energies ( the mixing in this channel is suppressed if the mixing in @xmath69 is strong ) ; and similarly the jumps in @xmath70 are small for all energies . for future reference , the values of the transition probabilities @xmath71 and @xmath72 through this profile for @xmath56 neutrinos are @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively , for @xmath57 neutrinos they are @xmath75 and @xmath76 , for @xmath58 neutrinos they are @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the evolution of the neutrinos and antineutrinos through the underlying base profile will determine the extent to which turbulence is able to modify the emerging probabilities .",
    "in general we find that if @xmath10 is close to the limits of zero or unity then the effect of turbulence tends to be smaller , everything else being equal .",
    "thus we should expect big effects in @xmath64 even at small turbulence amplitudes while effects in @xmath65 , @xmath66 and the antineutrinos will require somewhat larger density fluctuations .",
    "it is in the region between the forward and reverse shocks that strong turbulence is seen in multi - dimensional simulations so that is where we shall modify the profile to insert the turbulence . as in lund & kneller @xcite ,",
    "we use two random field realizations : one for the zone between the forward shock and the contact discontinuity , and a second between the contact discontinuity and the reverse shock .",
    "realizations are generated by multiplying @xmath42 by a factor @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a gaussian random field with a power spectrum @xmath23 .",
    "quite generally we may write the random field @xmath80 within the region @xmath81 to @xmath82 as a fourier series of the form @xmath83 the purpose of the two @xmath84 functions is to damp the fluctuations close to @xmath81 and @xmath82 and the parameter @xmath85 is the damping scale which we set to @xmath86 .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 is the root - mean - square amplitude of the field and we shall use the same value of @xmath87 for the two realizations for simplicity .",
    "the set of co - efficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 are independent standard , zero - mean gaussian random variates ( which ensures the mean value of @xmath90 is zero ) , the wavenumbers for the fourier modes are @xmath91 and the quantities @xmath92 are ` volume ' co - efficients .",
    "the method for generating a realization of the turbulence is the same ` variant c ' of the randomization method described in kramer , kurbanmuradov , & sabelfeld @xcite and used in kneller & mauney @xcite .",
    "the space of wavenumbers is divided into @xmath93 regions and from each region we select a random wavenumber @xmath94 using the normalized power - spectrum , @xmath95 , as a probability distribution .",
    "the volume parameters @xmath92 are the integrals of the power spectrum over each region . in order to produce random fields that affect the neutrinos",
    "we must cover a sufficiently large dynamic range of scales . given the size of the turbulence regions shown in figure ( [ fig : profile ] ) and the neutrino oscillation lengthscale of @xmath96 at these densities ,",
    "the dynamic range is found to be of order 40 - 50 decibels which requires at a minimum that @xmath93 also be in the range 40 - 50 @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of the random field is taken to be an inverse power law of the form @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the spectral index and @xmath99 is the long wavelength , small wavenumber , cutoff .",
    "the parameter @xmath99 is sometimes called the ` driving scale ' since it is the longest , non - zero turbulence wavelength . in our case",
    "this wavelength is twice the size of the turbulence domains , that is , @xmath100 .",
    "the assumption that the power spectrum @xmath23 has no spatial dependence is the simplest choice we can make but it s an assumption that should be examined further .",
    "though there is evidence that the power spectrum of the angular kinetic energy during the accretion phase does show radial dependence @xcite , that does not automatically mean we should find radial dependence in the turbulence power spectrum during the cooling phase when the turbulence is far out in the stellar mantle .",
    "similarly we know of no evidence that the turbulence power spectrum in a three dimensional simulation of a supernova at the appropriate epoch over the range of lengthscales we require is anything other than a single inverse power law : the broken power law found by borriello et al @xcite is relic of the two dimensional nature of the simulation they analysed .    with the hamiltonian including",
    "turbulence constructed our plan is to generate multiple realizations of the turbulence and then solve equation ( [ eq : s ] ) for the evolution matrix for each realization .",
    "this approach will allow us to construct ensembles of results which we can then characterize with frequency distributions or with distribution moments .     as a function of distance @xmath101 for a @xmath57 neutrino .",
    "the dashed line is the evolution through the underlying profile and the solid line is the evolution with a single realization of turbulence with spectral index @xmath102 . in the top panel @xmath103 , in the middle @xmath104 and in the bottom @xmath105[fig : p23vsr:15mev : two effects ] ]",
    "before presenting the results from our numerical calculations , we first take time to demonstrate the two effects of turbulence . as we previously stated , the first effect is the modification of the neutrino transition probability evolution in the region of the turbulence due to direct stimulation between the states , and the second is the modification of the transition probabilities of the neutrino as it emerges from a turbulent region if the transition probabilities are subject to phase effects .",
    "the two effects are neatly shown in figure ( [ fig : p23vsr:15mev : two effects ] ) where we see the evolution of the transition probability @xmath64 as a function of distance through the profile shown in figure ( [ fig : profile ] ) for a @xmath48 neutrino . in the top panel",
    "where @xmath106 we see the first case : the evolution of the transition probability with turbulence differs from the evolution without turbulence as soon as the neutrino enters the turbulence region . in the middle panel",
    "where @xmath107 we see a small differences between the evolution with and without turbulence as soon as the neutrino enters the turbulence but the jumps at the discontinuities are significantly larger . in the bottom panel",
    "where @xmath108 there is no apparent difference between the evolution with and without turbulence _ until _ the contact discontinuity . beyond that point",
    "the two curves are different but exhibit no relative change until the neutrino passes through the forward shock where another large change occurs . in these bottom two panels",
    "the change in the evolution is mainly due to a change in the phase effects ; phase effects do occur in the top panel but are subordinate . but note well that that even though the turbulence amplitude differs by two orders of magnitude between the three calculations , the value of @xmath64 that emerges is very similar in each case .",
    "in addition to the visual distinction between the two effects , it is possible to understand these two effects in more analytic terms .",
    "these analytic descriptions will prove useful because they allow us to construct expectations for , and thus interpret , the results from ensembles of realizations of the turbulence which we shall present in section ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "let us first concentrate on the distortion of the phase effect .",
    "we shall use a two - flavor model and a profile with two discontinuities which will be found to both adequately describe our results and to understand the effect . in the matter basis in which we work , figure ( [ fig : p23vsr:15mev : two effects ] )",
    "indicates that when the turbulence amplitude is small the neutrino passes through a set of discontinuities at the entrance and exit of the turbulent regions but evolves adiabaticaly in the turbulence region between the discontinuities .",
    "we can construct an evolution matrix which describes this evolution and from it derive the transition probability .",
    "first , the matter basis evolution matrix describing the evolution across a discontinuity located at @xmath101 is @xmath109 where @xmath17 is the matter mixing matrix , @xmath110 is a point immediately before the discontinuity and @xmath111 a point immediately after .",
    "adiabatic evolution of the neutrino between discontinuities means the evolution matrix must be of the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 is the instantaneous eigenvalue for matter state @xmath115 .",
    "thus the evolution matrix describing the neutrino evolution through a profile with two discontinuities , located at @xmath116 and @xmath117 is @xmath118 where we have omitted the evolution up to @xmath119 and beyond @xmath120 assuming it to be adiabatic . if we denote by @xmath121 and @xmath122 the crossing probabilities through the discontinuities separately , we find the crossing probability for the neutrino after passing through the entire profile is @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "note well that @xmath121 and @xmath122 are constants and not changed when we insert turbulence into the profile and that @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "this dependence of @xmath127 upon the matter mixing matrix elements indicates the crossing probability @xmath127 is most sensitive to the turbulence via the distorted phase effect when the the msw resonance density is similar to one of the densities on either side of the discontinuity .",
    "the place where the turbulence enters equation ( [ eq : phaseeffect ] ) is via the phase difference @xmath128 .",
    "every realization of the turbulence will give a different value for the phase difference and if we generate many realizations then we generate a distribution of phase differences .",
    "thus we can model the effect of the turbulence by treating the phase difference @xmath128 as a random variate drawn from a distribution @xmath129 .",
    "the model we adopt for the distribution of @xmath128 is the von mises distribution which is of the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the mean value of @xmath128 and @xmath132 is the concentration .",
    "if we define @xmath133 and @xmath134 and note that @xmath135 then we derive the distribution for @xmath127 must be @xmath136\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the interval @xmath137 . in the limit where @xmath138 , the distribution of @xmath128 is rectangular and the probability distribution for @xmath127 becomes the arcsine distribution i.e.   @xmath139 which has a mean of @xmath140 and variance of @xmath141 .",
    "note that in this limit there is no explicit dependence of @xmath142 upon the spectral index @xmath98 nor @xmath87 because @xmath140 and @xmath143 are independent of the turbulence .    in the other limit where the concentration is large we can expand the phase @xmath128 around @xmath131 so that to lowest order ( assuming @xmath144 ) @xmath145 where @xmath146 .",
    "this equation shows @xmath127 and @xmath128 are linearly related in this limit and so the standard deviation of @xmath127 is proportional to the the standard deviation of @xmath128 : @xmath147 .",
    "the phase difference @xmath128 between two discontinuities is given by @xmath148 and for neutrinos far from a msw resonance - such as the @xmath58 neutrinos in the @xmath69 mixing channel - the difference between @xmath149 and @xmath150 is approximately the msw potential @xmath151 in the region where we place the turbulence .",
    "this means we can write an expression for the variance of @xmath128 which is @xmath152 the integral is dominated by the longer wavelengths , lowest wavenumbers of the random field @xmath90 - the integral over the turbulence modes with wavelengths smaller than the scale height of the potential will be very small .",
    "if we ignore all the fourier modes except the lowest then we predict @xmath153 and , since @xmath154 , we have @xmath155 . putting this together with the linear relationship between @xmath127 and @xmath128 we conclude @xmath156 this result indicates harder turbulence power spectra have less effect upon the transition probability than softer spectra .",
    "this makes sense because for phase distortion the neutrinos are more sensitive to the longest wavelength of the turbulence and those amplitudes _ increase _ with @xmath98 .",
    "obviously the distorted phase effect of turbulence requires a phase effect be present in the transition probability in the absence of turbulence . glancing at figure ( [ fig : pevolution ] )",
    "we see only @xmath64 has a strong phase effect with two or more semi - adiabatic transitions at the three energies we are using , plus @xmath65 and @xmath67 for the @xmath56 neutrinos : in all other mixing channels the jumps in @xmath10 at the discontinuities are too small .",
    "thus we expect to see the distorted phase effect of turbulence for all three energies we are using in the @xmath157 mixing channel , and maybe a small distorted phase effect in @xmath158 _ and _ @xmath159 at @xmath56 .      a detailed description of the direct stimulation of transitions between neutrino states by turbulence can be found in kneller , mclaughlin & patton @xcite and the two papers by patton , kneller & mclaughlin @xcite . in this description",
    "the effect of the turbulence can be understood as similar to the effect of a laser upon a polarized molecule .",
    "comparison between numerical and analytical solutions reveals the description to be very powerful because it is able to predict the effect of turbulence on a case - by - case basis .",
    "for every pair of neutrino matter states @xmath160 and @xmath115 there is an associated splitting @xmath161 between two eigenvalues of the hamiltonian . as equation ( [ eq : f1d ] ) indicates , turbulence can be described with a fourier series and one finds that transitions between the neutrino states will be occur if a set of integers @xmath162 can be found , one for each fourier mode , such that @xmath163 . when the condition is exact , known as a parametric resonance @xcite , the amplitude of the transition between states @xmath160 and @xmath115 is @xmath164 no matter the amplitudes of each fourier mode .",
    "where the amplitudes of the modes enter is through the distance @xmath16 - called the transition wavelength - over which a neutrino makes the transition from state @xmath160 to state @xmath115 or vice versa .",
    "this distance is inversely proportional to the coupling between the two states i.e.  @xmath165 , where @xmath166 are elements of the unperturbed matter mixing matrix , and also inversely proportional to a product of bessel functions @xmath167 where @xmath168 and the integer @xmath169 is the same integer previously identified .",
    "@xmath170 is the amplitude of the fourier mode @xmath171 . in order for a stimulated transition to occur one must compare @xmath16 with the density scale height @xmath172 of the underlying profile defined to be @xmath173 .",
    "only if @xmath174 is a transition expected , if @xmath175 then none will occur .",
    "finally , the only difference when one considers antineutrinos is that the splitting @xmath161 and coupling @xmath176 are computed using a hamiltonian where the msw potential switches sign",
    ".    at small @xmath87 one typically finds the integers are @xmath177 for all @xmath171 _ except _ for the mode whose wavenumber is closest to the eigenvalue splitting @xmath161 @xcite . in this limit",
    "the smallness of @xmath170 indicates @xmath178 for that mode will also be small so we may use @xmath179 for small @xmath180 .",
    "putting this all together we find the transition wavelength in the small amplitude limit goes as @xmath181 the transition wavelength @xmath16 is inversely proportional to that resonant mode s amplitude @xmath170 - which depends upon @xmath98 and @xmath87 - and the product of mixing matrix elements @xmath165 in the region of the turbulence . in order to make @xmath16 small and see stimulated transition we must either increase @xmath165 and/or @xmath170 .",
    "increasing @xmath165 means the turbulence must be in the vicinity of the msw density because the product takes on its maximal value at that location .",
    "this is the same requirement as in the distorted phase effect .",
    "since the expectation value of @xmath170 goes as @xmath182 we see increasing @xmath170 can be achieved by either increasing @xmath87 or decreasing @xmath98 .",
    "the evolution of the underlying profile means the splitting between the neutrino eigenvalues @xmath161 and the coupling @xmath165 between the matter states both evolve with @xmath183 .",
    "this means neutrinos experience a parametric resonance only at a point and at present it is only possible to predict where and with what approximate strength the transitions occur .",
    "phenomenologically one finds the distributions of the transition probabilities are exponentially distributed with greater widths as @xmath87 and @xmath165 increase @xcite .    in the limit of large turbulence amplitudes and",
    "optimally placed turbulence , stimulated transitions occur essentially continuously in the turbulence region - the parametric resonance condition is fulfilled many times through the profile - and in virtually all realizations .",
    "when this occurs one finds the evolution matrix for the evolution between the discontinuities becomes essentially random rendering the evolution across the discontinuities unimportant . in this strong stimulated transition limit",
    "an ensemble of evolution matrices approaches that of an ensemble of @xmath184-flavor circular unitary matrices @xcite where the distribution of every element of the matrices is identical .",
    "this limit is known as depolarization and from the expectation for the structure of the ensemble of evolution matrices we can derive the distributions of the transition probabilities . first , we note that the @xmath184 real components , @xmath185 , plus the @xmath184 imaginary components , @xmath186 , of the elements of a row or column in every evolution matrix form a 2@xmath184 euclidean space .",
    "the requirement of unitarity of the evolution matrix is equivalent to the definition that a vector made from these real and imaginary components lies upon the surface of a unit sphere in this space .",
    "since these 2@xmath184 quantities are identically distributed , the probability @xmath187 of a particular set of the elements from a row or column must be uniform over the surface of the sphere .",
    "for example , if we chose to look at a column @xmath115 then the probability that we are located at @xmath188 , must be proportional to the area element @xmath189 allowing us to write @xmath190 if we now change variables so that each of the @xmath184 independent pairs @xmath191 are expressed as @xmath192 then the @xmath10 s are found to be distributed as @xmath193 the set of transition probabilities @xmath194 are uniformly distributed on the surface of a standard @xmath195 simplex . equation ( [ eq : da ] ) can be integrated over @xmath195 of the @xmath10 s and normalized so that we derive the final result that element @xmath10 must be distributed according to @xmath196 the shape of the distribution is controlled by the number of flavors @xmath184 that are involved and nothing else . with",
    "the distribution for @xmath10 found it is a simple task to determine that the mean and variance are @xmath197 for the specific case of @xmath198 the distribution is uniform with mean @xmath199 and variance @xmath200 : for @xmath201 the distribution is triangular with mean @xmath202 and variance @xmath203 .",
    "note that the depolarized limits do not explicitly depend upon any property of the turbulence , they are functions only of the appropriate number of flavors involved .",
    "it is via @xmath184 that the turbulence amplitude and spectral index will enter because the appropriate value of @xmath184 will change as @xmath87 and @xmath98 are varied .",
    "since there are three flavors of neutrino it would seem we should use the @xmath201 case but in practice whether 3-flavor depolarization is actually reached depends upon the placement of the turbulence in the profile in relation to the h _ and _ l resonance densities for a given energy . if not located in the appropriate place in the profile for a given neutrino energy , two flavor depolarization may be more appropriate .",
    "as we stated , the distance over which a neutrino makes the transition from matter state @xmath115 to matter state @xmath160 is proportional to the product of instantaneous mixing matrix elements @xmath204 .",
    "this product has its maximal value at the resonance between states @xmath160 and @xmath115 .",
    "figure ( [ fig : profile ] ) shows that the h resonance density for the @xmath49 neutrinos is below the densities where we place the turbulence by a factor @xmath205 , the l resonance density is lower by a factor @xmath206 . for @xmath49",
    "neutrinos we should expect some difficultly stimulating transitions between matter states @xmath207 and @xmath62 but it should be somewhat easier for mixing between states @xmath62 and @xmath63 . for the lower energy of @xmath57",
    "the h resonance density is very similar to the density of the profile between the reverse shock and the contact discontinuity which would lead us to expect a strong stimulated transition effect in this channel for this energy .",
    "the l resonance for this same energy again lies below the density of the profile meaning the product of mixing matrix elements @xmath208 will be small again suppressing stimulated transitions between @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "finally , the h resonance density for the @xmath56 neutrinos is similar to the density of the profile between the contact discontinuity and the reverse shock _ and _ the difference between the l resonance density and the profile density between the reverse shock and the contact discontinuity is only of order a factor of a few .",
    "thus of the three energies we are considering , the @xmath56 neutrinos have the best prospect of exhibiting stimulated transitions between all three states and reaching 3 flavor depolarization , the @xmath48 and @xmath49 neutrinos should show evidence for stimulated transition only between two states .             for the case of a @xmath58 neutrino .",
    "the spectral index is set to @xmath211 and , from top to bottom , the turbulence amplitude is @xmath108 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "[ fp23:45mev.small amplitude ] ]    the stimulated transitions work between the discontinuities in the profile while the evolution across the discontinuities themselves is still given by @xmath214 . thus stimulated transitions and distorted phases do not work separately , they work in tandem .",
    "the essential difference between the two is for stimulated transitions one replaces the central evolution matrix in equation ( [ eq : sphaseeffect ] ) which describes adiabatic evolution between the discontinuities with a matrix that may or may not have non - zero off diagonal elements depending upon whether there were any stimulated transitions in the turbulence region .",
    "even if there are no stimulated transitions in the turbulence region , at a minimum the turbulence will distort the phase .",
    "for this reason we often find circumstances where the distributions for the transition probabilities in a given channel are not completely described by a distorted phase model nor solely described by stimulated transitions but rather exhibit contributions from both .",
    "these situations arise because stimulated transitions are often found to be ` all - or - nothing ' .",
    "thus the frequency distributions of the transition probabilities in these circumstances are seen to be mixtures of two distinct , more fundamental , distributions - see for example figure ( 12 ) in kneller & volpe @xcite - which can cause difficulty with interpretation of results .",
    "mixing between distributions will shift the means and variances of the total distribution from the expected values of the two , more fundamental , components .",
    "if the distribution type a , with mean transition probability @xmath215 and variance @xmath216 , contributes a fraction @xmath187 to the total distribution , and a different distribution , type b , with mean transition probability @xmath217 and variance @xmath218 contributes @xmath219 , then the mean transition probability of the total distribution is @xmath220 and similarly the variance is also @xmath221 .",
    "one should expect the fraction @xmath187 to depend upon the neutrino energy and snapshot time as well as the turbulence amplitude @xmath87 and the spectral index @xmath98 .",
    "knowing @xmath187 is useful if one wants to , say , simulate supernova neutrino signals using monte carlo methods .",
    "the neutrinos we receive at a given instant from the next supernova in our galaxy will all have traveled through similar turbulence as they traversed the mantle of the star which has the consequence that the transition probabilities of the neutrinos of a given energy will be very strongly correlated - the size of the proto - neutron in not sufficient to wash this correlation out unless the turbulence is very anisotropic @xcite .",
    "this means that the neutrino signal will not have sampled the ensemble of realizations of the turbulence , we receive neutrinos which have been affected by essentially just one realization .",
    "the probability this realization gives transition probabilities distributed according to distribution type a is the fraction @xmath187 ; the probability the transition probabilities are distributed according to distribution type b is @xmath219 .",
    "in figures ( [ fig : mean ] ) and ( [ fig : sigma ] ) we show the mean values and standard deviation of the distributions of the neutrino transition probabilities @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath64 as a function of the spectral index and the turbulence amplitude for the three representative energies we are using .",
    "even a cursory glance indicates there is a great deal of rich behavior as a function of the three parameters we have varied to generate the figures . before diving into the results in depth to try and understand why we see the trends we do ,",

    "finally we switch to the @xmath56 neutrinos . here",
    "neither the h resonance nor the l resonance are too far from the densities where we insert the turbulence so the product of instantaneous mixing matrix elements @xmath165 are not small in any mixing channel .",
    "this allows stimulated transitions to occur between all three states simultaneously .",
    "the simultaneous mixing in all three channels indicates we might find that at sufficiently large amplitudes and hard spectral indices we could reach three - flavor depolarization .",
    "when we look indeed this is found for @xmath278 and @xmath279 shown in figure ( [ fp12,13,23:5mev.large amplitude ] ) where we see the frequency distributions of the transition probabilities are triangular as predicted .",
    "thus figures ( [ fig : mean ] ) and ( [ fig : sigma ] ) reveal the three - flavor depolarized limit is reached for @xmath65 only for @xmath247 and @xmath225 whereas the same limit appears somewhat easier to reach for @xmath64 because even @xmath280 amplitude turbulence saturates at @xmath281 and @xmath282 for @xmath242 or at @xmath283 we are able to relax the spectral index to @xmath284 .",

    "note also the figures do not indicate there are combinations of @xmath87 and @xmath98 where we achieve two flavor depolarization instead of three because we do not see @xmath285 or @xmath286 as one would expect in that limit .",
    "as we move to smaller turbulence amplitudes what we observe in figures ( [ fig : mean ] ) and ( [ fig : sigma ] ) might seem at first to be contradictory .",
    "the mean transition probability in the ensembles is the same as the value in the turbulence free limit tempting one to conclude that turbulence has no effect , but the standard deviations do not support this conclusion because it is not until @xmath287 that the turbulence effect actually disappears .",
    "the contradictions can be resolved when one realizes what the figures are showing is that between @xmath288 the distributions of the transition probabilities are simply _ centered _ on the turbulence - free limits . as with the @xmath49 neutrinos , the acute sensitivity to @xmath87 is due to the distorted phase effect with the twist that now both @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( and @xmath67 ) are affected .",
    "the distributions of @xmath65 and @xmath64 when @xmath289 are mixtures of an exponential and the distorted phase distributions and the evolution of @xmath290 and @xmath251 are actually due to the evolution of the exponentially distributed subset , not the subset where the turbulence only distorts the phase .",
    "this can be seen in figure ( [ fig : fp12vsalpha ] ) where we show the distributions for @xmath65 for the @xmath47 neutrinos at three values of @xmath98 when @xmath245 .",
    "note the similarity of the low end of the distribution for @xmath273 and @xmath244 .",
    "even though we are considering just a normal hierarchy , large amplitude turbulence certainly does affect the antineutrinos . in figures ( [ fig : meanbar ] ) and ( [ fig : sigmabar ] ) we show the results for the means and standard deviations of the ensembles of antineutrino transition probabilities .",
    "let us again try to summarize what we observe in the figures .",
    "* the antineutrino channel which is most sensitive to the turbulence is @xmath67 and this sensitivity is similar to the sensitivity of @xmath65 seen in figures ( [ fig : mean ] ) and ( [ fig : sigma ] ) . @xmath70 and @xmath68 are quite different from @xmath66 and @xmath64 .",
    "* we also observe that at the largest value of @xmath87 shown , the evolution of @xmath291 and @xmath292 with the antineutrino energy appears to be counter that of @xmath293 , @xmath294 , @xmath295 and @xmath296 .",
    "we now try to understand these results .",
    "first , a description of the turbulence effects upon the antineutrinos for a normal hierarchy in terms of msw resonances would obviously not work well because there are no resonances in the antineutrino mixing channels .",
    "second , except for @xmath67 at @xmath47 , the distorted phase effect will not be prominent because the adiabaticity of the transitions for the antineutrinos across the discontinuities in the profile are large .",
    "it is this lack of distorted phase effects that explains the greatly reduced sensitivity of the neutrinos to the turbulence amplitude .",
    "the absence of distorted phase effects in the majority of the results shown in figures ( [ fig : meanbar ] ) and ( [ fig : sigmabar ] ) makes their interpretation much easier than the neutrino transition probabilities .",
    "the only explanation that applies is that stimulated transitions .",
    "if we look closely we see for the case of @xmath67 when @xmath47 and @xmath48 we see that @xmath67 appears to be as sensitive to the turbulence as the neutrinos in the @xmath65 channel .",
    "this can be explained by the stimulated transition model . in the turbulent region",
    "the eigenvalue splitting @xmath297 and @xmath298 are both approximately equal to the msw potential @xmath299 and so the coupling between the states , @xmath165 and @xmath176 are also approximately equal .",
    "this equivalence means it should be as easy to stimulate a transition between states @xmath300 and @xmath301 as it is between @xmath302 and @xmath303 so the response to the turbulence will be the same .",
    "but in all other cases the antineutrinos are not as sensitive to the turbulence as the neutrinos which , again , can be explained stimulated transition description .",
    "the difficulty of stimulating transitions between antineutrino states is twofold : first , in the normal hierarchy , the splitting between the eigenvalues are larger which means we require shorter wavelength fourier modes in order to fulfill the parametric resonance condition and , with an inverse power law power spectrum , the amplitudes of these modes are smaller .",
    "secondly the coupling between the states , @xmath176 , is also generally smaller in the antineutrinos",
    ". both smaller amplitudes for the resonance modes and smaller coupling lengthen the distance @xmath16 over which the transition occurs .",
    "since we need @xmath16 to be smaller than the density scale height @xmath172 in order to see a stimulated transition , it requires very large @xmath87 before stimulated transitions appear in the antineutrino mixing channels as figures ( [ fig : meanbar ] ) and ( [ fig : sigmabar ] ) indicate . hardening the spectrum has the simultaneous effect of raising the amplitude of the resonance modes and decreasing the amplitudes of modes which cause suppression so we expect a strong dependence upon @xmath98 up to the point where the combination of large amplitude and hardness of the turbulence power spectrum means the antineutrinos reach depolarization . beyond that point ,",
    "the dependence upon amplitudes and power spectral indices is lost . from figures ( [ fig : meanbar ] ) and ( [ fig : sigmabar ] ) it appears a two - flavor depolarization is approached in @xmath67 for @xmath47 and @xmath304 and in @xmath70 for @xmath49 and @xmath305 only when @xmath306 .    except in these cases of very large amplitudes and",
    "hard spectra , inspection reveals the distributions of the probabilities clearly posses two components .",
    "for example , the distributions for @xmath67 when @xmath49 and @xmath306 are mixtures of sharp , zero - peaked distribution and an exponential distribution .",
    "when we look closely we often find the fraction of the distribution affected by stimulated transitions decreases with @xmath98 but , simulataneously , the effect of the stimulated transitions grows with @xmath98 .",
    "this is seen in figure ( [ fig : p12bar:15mev ] ) where we plot the frequency distributions of @xmath67 at the energy of @xmath48 and @xmath245 .",
    "the two mixing distributions are clearly seen in the bottom panel where @xmath307 . at @xmath242",
    "the mixing distributions are a sharp , zero - peaked distribution and an exponential ; at @xmath307 this has changed to a sharp , zero - peaked distribution and a two - flavor depolarized distribution .",
    "these distributions can be compared with those of @xmath65 in figure ( [ fig : p12:15mev ] ) for the same energy .",
    "the mixing channel @xmath70 is also , generally , a mixture of exponential and narrow distribution which peaks at zero .",
    "the two cases shown which do not match this pattern are for the @xmath48 and @xmath49 antineutrinos at @xmath240 and @xmath308 where the distribution is very close to uniform .    finally , the one case where distorted phase effects occur are in @xmath67 when @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this should be expected because in figure ( [ fig : pevolution ] ) we see that the changes in @xmath65 and @xmath67 are occurring when the density is between the h and l resonances for the @xmath47 and @xmath48 neutrinos .",
    "plane where the different turbulence effects occur in the h resonant channel @xmath64 for different energies . in the top panel @xmath47 , in the center @xmath48 , and in the bottom panel @xmath49 and in",
    "each the acronyms stand for depolarization ( d ) , stimulated transitions ( st ) , saturated phase effects ( spe ) , weak phase effects ( wpe ) , and the region where only msw effects occur , i.e.  no turbulence , is labeled as msw.[fig : regions ] ]",
    "in this paper we have investigated the effect of modifying the turbulence power spectrum inserted into a supernova density profile upon the neutrinos and antineutrinos for three different representative neutrino energies .",
    "we have seen the turbulence alters the transitions probabilities of the neutrinos via two effects : the direct stimulation of transitions between the states via parametric resonances , and the more subtle effect of changing the phase between semi - adiabatic resonances and/or discontinuities if they are present .",
    "the two effects depend upon the turbulence power spectrum in different fashions and whether a dependence upon the spectral index is present or not for neutrinos of a given energy depends upon the progenitor structure , the postbounce epoch , the turbulence amplitude and the neutrino energy .",
    "the two most important factors that determine the extent to which turbulence affects the neutrinos is the location of the turbulence in relation to the neutrino s resonance densities and the turbulence amplitude .",
    "turbulence effects are largest when the turbulence is located in the profile in the vicinity of the neutrino resonances ( both l and h ) because both effects depend upon the mixing matrix having both large diagonal _ and _ off - diagonal entries in the region where the turbulence is located and the msw resonances are the locations where these entries are equal in magnitude . in this paper",
    "we have used a density profile at a fixed snapshot time and considered three different neutrino energies in order to demonstrate this dependence between the turbulence effects and msw densities . fixing the neutrino",
    "energy and changing the snapshot time would produce similar results . in figure ( [ fig : regions ] )",
    "we show the regions of @xmath87 and @xmath98 where we find the various turbulence effects in the mixing between @xmath62 and @xmath63 . to construct the figure we have extracted various contours of @xmath229 from figure ( [ fig : sigma ] ) . for each energy",
    "we find no effect from turbulence when @xmath309 so have set this as a lower limit in each case . for the @xmath49 neutrinos the boundary between the weak and saturated phase effects",
    "is taken to be where @xmath310 , the boundary between saturated phase effects and stimulated transitions as where @xmath311 . for the @xmath48 neutrinos the boundary between the weak and saturated phase effects",
    "is taken to be where @xmath243 , and this same value of @xmath229 forms the boundary between saturated phase effects and stimulated transitions .",
    "for the boundary between the depolarization region and the stimulated transitions we use @xmath312 . finally , for the @xmath47 neutrinos we do not find a boundary between saturated and weak phase effects , the boundary between saturated phase effects and stimulated transitions is where @xmath310 and depolarization is taken to occur when @xmath313 .",
    "we caution the reader that these boundaries are somewhat fuzzy in the sense that on the boundaries the distributions are often mixtures and furthermore these values of @xmath229 have no meaning in themselves .",
    "let us use this figure to summarize what we have found .    if we optimize the location of the turbulence by careful selection of the profile , we find the stimulated transition effects appear in every mixing channel - even antineutrinos - when the turbulence amplitude exceeds @xmath250 . as one expects for the epoch chosen ,",
    "the turbulence effects are strongest in the h resonant channel followed by the mixing in @xmath209-@xmath210 and @xmath300-@xmath301 .",
    "the sensitivity of the h resonant channel at this epoch is largely the same for all three energies .",
    "the extent to which @xmath209-@xmath210 and @xmath300-@xmath301 are affected at this epoch does depend upon the neutrino energy because of the difference of the relation between the turbulent densities and the l resonance for different energies .",
    "thus , at this epoch , we see lower energies affected by turbulence to a greater degree than higher energies due to the greater coupling between the states @xmath207 and @xmath62 . but even though stimulated transition effects may be present , the neutrinos do not always exhibit a dependence upon the turbulence power spectral index because stimulated transitions possess a strong limit of depolarization and a weak limit . in the strong limit",
    "no @xmath98 dependence is found because the distributions of the transition probabilities are depolarized , either two or three flavor ; in the weak limit the distributions are found to be exponential and are sensitive to @xmath98 . the boundary between the two regimes shown in figure ( [ fig : regions ] )",
    "depends upon @xmath98 and the turbulence amplitude @xmath87 with a greater proportion of depolarization at fixed @xmath87 when the power spectrum is hardened .",
    "stimulated transitions occur when the product of turbulence amplitude and diagonal / off - diagonal mixing matrix elements is large .",
    "when this product is not above threshold the distorted phase effect of turbulence can become apparent .",
    "the boundary between stimulated transitions and phase effects is the dot - dashed line in figure ( [ fig : regions ] ) .",
    "in fact , if we optimize the location of the turbulence then the sensitivity to @xmath87 via the distorted phase effect can be extreme with turbulence amplitudes as small as @xmath314 causing an effect . note",
    "this amplitude is comparable with the amplitude of the density fluctuations in the progenitor @xcite and furthermore the boundary between weak phase effects and the msw only region in figure ( [ fig : regions ] ) varies with the epoch : at earlier epochs the boundary lies at much higher values of @xmath87 because the turbulence is far from the h resonant region .",
    "like stimulated transitions , the distorted phase effect has a strong and weak limit : in the strong limit the phase difference between discontinuities is distributed uniformly leading to arcsine distributions for the transition probabilities .",
    "when this occurs the parameters describing the arcsine distribution are determined by the jumps in the transition probabilities at the discontinuities and not the turbulence between them . for this reason the neutrinos",
    "are not affected by changes in the power spectral index . in the weak limit of the distorted phase effect",
    "the sensitivity to the power spectrum re - emerges due to the dominance of the long wavelength modes .",
    "counter - intuitively , this sensitivity to the longest wavelengths means harder spectra have _ less _ of an effect than soft spectra for a given @xmath87 .",
    "this difference in the dependence upon @xmath98 explains the downward slope of the boundary between strong and weak distorted phase effects in figure ( [ fig : regions ] ) .    while the dependence of turbulence effects upon neutrino energy , turbulence amplitude , spectral index etc .",
    "can be complicated , it is possible to use our results to piece together the expected evolution of the turbulence effects that neutrinos of a given energy will experience as a function of time .",
    "for neutrinos of a given energy there will be no sensitivity to the turbulence during the early phase of the burst signal because the turbulence is at densities far from the msw resonances .",
    "this requirement that the turbulence be close to the resonance density is the reason there were no turbulence effects seen by reid , adams and seunarine @xcite when they put turbulence into the post - shock region in profiles appropriate for the accretion epoch .",
    "as the forward shock and turbulence move out into the star turbulence effects will start to appear .",
    "initially these are due to distorted phase effects in the h resonance channel and , remarkably , the greater the spectral index @xmath98 the greater the sensitivity to the turbulence of a given amplitude . as time progresses the distorted phase effects for a given neutrino energy will saturate to a limit where the sensitivity to @xmath98 and @xmath87 is lost .",
    "as time progresses further stimulated transition effects will begin to appear if the amplitude is greater than @xmath250",
    ". stimulated transitions appear first in the h resonance channel and again , initially , exhibit a sensitivity to @xmath98 but now we find that smaller values of @xmath98 lead to greater turbulence effects for a given @xmath87 . as time progresses further still , yet again that dependence upon @xmath98 and @xmath87 may disappear if the turbulence amplitude is sufficiently great to cause depolarization .",
    "if that occurs , turbulence effects will begin to appear in the mixing between other states most prominently between @xmath209-@xmath210 _ and _ in the antineutrinos in the @xmath300-@xmath301 channel .",
    "the mixing in @xmath209-@xmath210 and @xmath300-@xmath301 follows the same sequence as the mixing in the h resonant channel i.e.   it starts off as weak distorted phase effects sensitive to @xmath98 and @xmath87 that then saturates before stimulated transitions appear if @xmath87 is sufficiently large .",
    "if stimulated transitions do start to affect the @xmath209-@xmath210 and @xmath300-@xmath301 evolution while mixing in the h resonant channel is still occurring then it is possible in a normal hierarchy to transition to three flavor depolarization if @xmath98 is sufficiently small and @xmath87 sufficiently large . finally ,",
    "as the turbulent region sweeps further out into the star , the turbulence effects will decrease in the h resonance channel and concentrate in the mixing between @xmath209-@xmath210 and @xmath300-@xmath301 which will then themselves eventually fade as the turbulence reaches the very outer edges of the star . the extent",
    "to which the turbulence effects at these late times are visible will depend upon the exact shape of the progenitor profile because the rapidly fading neutrino luminosity will make the statistics of detection very poor .",
    "this expected sequence of turbulence events allows us to answer our original question of whether the neutrinos exhibit sensitivity to the turbulence power spectrum .",
    "we conclude it indeed appears , in principal , there is sensitivity to the power spectral index in the signal from a galactic supernova and further analyses along the lines of borriello _ et al . _",
