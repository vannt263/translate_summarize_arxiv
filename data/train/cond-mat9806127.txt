    "advances in algorithms and hardware have greatly increased the power and scope of monte carlo studies of critical phenomena .",
    "cluster algorithms , first introduced by swendsen and wang @xcite , largely overcome the problems of critical slowing and thereby permit the study of very large systems using a reasonable number of monte carlo steps .",
    "parallel machines provide platforms on which very large systems may be efficiently studied .",
    "several groups @xcite have implemented cluster algorithms on parallel machines to obtain high precision results for the three - dimensional ising model .",
    "the invaded cluster ( ic ) algorithm @xcite is a new type of cluster algorithm with features that make it very attractive for high precision studies of critical phenomena .",
    "first , it has less critical slowing than other cluster algorithms .",
    "indeed , here we provide strong evidence that for the three - dimensional ising model there is no critical slowing down .",
    "second , the ic algorithm does not use an estimate of the critical temperature as an input ; instead , the critical point is sampled without any fine - tuning of parameters and an estimate of the critical temperature is obtained as an _ output _ of the simulation . on the other hand , the ic algorithm samples the ic ensemble rather than the canonical ensemble . although the two ensembles are believed to be equivalent in the infinite volume limit , the finite - size scaling properties of the ic ensemble are not yet well - understood .",
    "here we present results that test a simple finite - size scaling hypothesis and determine the associated finite - size scaling exponent .    in this paper",
    "we describe an implementation of the invaded cluster algorithm for distributed memory spmd ( single program multiple data ) parallel machines . using this algorithm we studied two- and three - dimensional ising systems up to size 4096@xmath4 and 512@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "there are several motivation for this project .",
    "the first is to develop an efficient implementation of the ic method for parallel computation .",
    "this is a non - trivial problem because the ic method appears to be quite sequential .",
    "the second objective is to better understand the dynamics of the ic algorithm and the finite - size scaling properties of the ic ensemble .",
    "these properties are interesting in their own right and they must be understood before the algorithm can be used for high - precision studies . finally , we wish to obtain accurate results for the critical temperature and exponents for the three - dimensional ising model . with relatively modest effort",
    "we have been able to obtain accuracy comparable to recent studies in the measurement of @xmath6 and somewhat less accuracy for the critical temperature .",
    "we argue that the ic method is likely to be the most efficient method for obtaining very high precision estimates for the critical temperature and the magnetic exponent for the ising model and related spin systems .    in sec .",

    "in cluster monte carlo methods a spin system is sampled in both its spin representation and in an associated _ graphical representation_. the graphical representation is an interacting percolation model that is usually defined on the bonds of the lattice .",
    "the graphical representation by itself contains all of the information relevant for the study of the spin system .",
    "a single monte carlo ( mc ) step consists of two parts , a ` bond move ' and a ` spin move . ' during the bond move , the spins are frozen and the graphical configuration ( bond configuration ) is updated in accord with the current spin configuration . during the spin move , it is the opposite : the bonds are frozen and the spin configuration is updated . in a critical region , tremendous improvements in the efficiency of cluster methods over traditional local dynamics can arise if the graphical representation has a coinciding percolation threshold . in this case , clusters of spins on all scales are coherently updated .    since the ic and swendsen - wang ( sw ) algorithms are very similar let us begin with a brief description of the sw algorithm .",
    "consider the nearest neighbor ising magnet on the square or cubic lattice defined by the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the dimensionless coupling , and the sum is over all the bonds of the lattice . during the bond move , each ` satisfied ' bond ( @xmath10 is satisfied if @xmath11 ) is independently occupied with probability @xmath12 or left vacant with probability @xmath13 .",
    "unsatisfied bonds are never occupied .",
    "after a bond configuration has been created in this fashion , _ clusters _ are identified : a cluster is a set of ( like ) spins connected by occupied bonds ; an isolated spin is also counted as clusters .",
    "next , the spin configuration is erased and the bond move is completed .",
    "the spin move for the sw algorithm consists of assigning either spin  up or spin  down with probability 1/2 independently to every cluster .",
    "each spin in the cluster takes the spin value assigned to the cluster and then the bond configuration is erased and the spin move is completed .",
    "the sw algorithm samples the canonical ensemble at coupling @xmath9 where @xmath9 is related to @xmath12 via @xmath14    the spin move for the ic algorithm is the same as for the sw algorithm : each cluster is assigned either spin  up or spin  down with probability 1/2 .",
    "the ic bond move consists of occupying the satisfied bonds in random order until the cluster configuration first fulfills a stopping rule . during the bond move",
    ", bonds are occupied one at a time and after each bond is added , the cluster structure is checked to see if the stopping rule is satisfied .",
    "there are a number of useful stopping rules , some of which , evidently , cause the algorithm to sample the ising critical point . in this study",
    ", we will use ` topological ' rules which are appropriate for systems with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "there are several versions : the ` 1-span ' topological rule demands that some cluster is connected around the system in at least one of the periodic directions  as soon as this condition is fulfilled , the bond move is complete and no more bonds are added to the configuration . in general , the @xmath15-span rule ( @xmath16 ) requires that there is connectivity around the system in at least @xmath15 directions .",
    "although all of the @xmath15-span rules sample the ising critical point , the different rules have different finite - size scaling behavior .",
    "the critical coupling and the magnetic exponent may be obtained in the ic approach .",
    "we begin with @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the ratio of the number bonds occupied during the bond move to the number of satisfied bonds for a single monte carlo ( mc ) step .",
    "the average value of @xmath18 is an estimator of the critical temperature according to the relation @xmath19 where @xmath17 is the critical coupling and @xmath20 is the system size . to understand this relation , note that the only difference between the sw and ic algorithms is the way in which @xmath18 is determined in a bond move . for the sw algorithm , each satisfied bond",
    "is independently occupied with probability @xmath12 so that the ratio of occupied to satisfied bonds is a binomial random variable . for the ic algorithm ,",
    "the stopping rule determines the number of occupied bonds .",
    "however , for large systems , one can presume that the fluctuations in @xmath18 become small for both algorithms . as a consequence , the ic algorithm that outputs @xmath21 yields the same value for all local observables as the sw algorithm with @xmath22 so that the relation @xmath23 yields an estimate of the temperature of the ic ensemble .",
    "the bond percolation threshold on the set of satisfied bonds at the ising critical point is known to be @xmath24 .",
    "since the @xmath15-span rules forces the cluster configuration to the percolation threshold , we see that eq .",
    "( [ eq : fbeta ] ) holds . this argument ( which still lacks a rigorous proof ) is discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite    let us now turn to a discussion of the magnetic exponent .",
    "for a critical stopping rule , such as a topological rule , the cluster that fulfills the stopping condition is called the _ spanning cluster_. this spanning cluster can be thought of as a typical example of a large  scale cluster at criticality and thus its fractal dimension yields the magnetic exponent for the system .",
    "in particular , if @xmath25 is the number of sites in the spanning cluster , we determine the fractal dimension @xmath26 via @xmath27 the fractal dimension is related to other critical exponents via @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the magnetic exponent , @xmath30 the magnetization exponent , @xmath31 the correlation length exponent and @xmath32 the spatial dimension . at the present time",
    "we do not know how to extract the thermal exponent from the ic algorithm .",
    "the finite - size scaling properties of the ic ensemble are currently under investigation . here",
    "we state the fundamental assumption that will be used later in the analysis of the data .",
    "let @xmath33 be the ( cumulative ) distribution function for @xmath18 measured in a system of size @xmath20 .",
    "we suppose that there is an exponent , @xmath34 and function @xmath35 such that @xmath36\\ ] ] naive finite - size scaling arguments suggest that @xmath37 with @xmath31 the ising correlation length exponent , however it is quite apparent that this is not the case .",
    "measurements of @xmath34 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and below in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] yield a value @xmath38 in @xmath39 .",
    "presumably this @xmath34 is the inverse of the correlation length exponent for a related percolation ",
    "ising hybrid model but at present , no definitive conclusions have been obtained .",
    "the approach taken here to parallelize the ic algorithm is based upon the parallel sw algorithm described in ref .",
    "the basic idea for both algorithms is to divide the lattice into cells each of which is handled by a single processor . during the bond move the cluster configuration",
    "must be determined .",
    "every site of the lattice has an integer label that identifies its cluster membership .",
    "two sites are in the same cluster if they have the same label . at the beginning of the bond move",
    ", every site has a unique local label .",
    "the sw bond move proceeds in two stages . in the _ local _ stage ,",
    "each processor in parallel occupies a fraction @xmath12 of the satisfied bonds in its cell and identifies the local cluster structure using a conventional sequential method .",
    "the local clusters are the clusters that would exist if no bonds on the boundaries of the cell were occupied . during the _ relaxation _ stage ,",
    "global labels are created and global clusters are identified .",
    "global clusters which are formed out of local clusters by boundary connections between cells are assigned the lowest valued label from the the labels of the connected local clusters .",
    "this is accomplished iteratively by the exchange of labels between neighboring cells .",
    "a very similar relaxation stage is used for the ic algorithm except that more information must be exchanged between nodes to allow for checking the stopping condition .    since",
    "communication between processing nodes is much slower than processes handled by a single node it is desirable that individual nodes do as much work as possible between communication steps . on the other hand , the sequential ic algorithm checks for spanning after each new bond",
    "is occupied .",
    "clearly this would not be a good approach to directly parallelize .",
    "instead , the algorithm converges to the value of @xmath18 by a sequence of choices of @xmath12 .",
    "imagine that an independent uniform random number between 0 and 1 is assigned to each bond of the lattice .",
    "( in fact , this is not quite the approach that is actually used but , for purposes of explanation , suppose that this is the case . ) on the first step each processor provisionally occupies all satisfied bonds with random numbers less than @xmath40 .",
    "the resulting cluster configuration is identified and the stopping rule is checked .",
    "for the sake of argument , suppose that spanning is not detected .",
    "in this case , the provisionally occupied bonds are permanently occupied and a new value @xmath41 is chosen . the current cluster configuration is stored and additional bonds are provisionally occupied with random numbers from @xmath40 to @xmath42 . the cluster configuration is modified accordingly and the stopping condition is checked .",
    "if spanning is not detected , the new cluster configuration is stored and the provisionally occupied bonds given tenure .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is incremented in this way until on the @xmath43th step the stopping condition is fulfilled . at this point we know that spanning occurs between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we backtrack to the cluster configuration ( saved in memory ) associated with @xmath44 and try again , this time choosing @xmath46 .",
    "henceforth , the algorithm carries out a binary search , each time reducing the range of @xmath12 by half until the stopping condition is just fulfilled and @xmath18 is determined .    in the above discussion we supposed that random numbers are assigned to each bond and that on each step all satisfied bonds with random numbers less than @xmath12 are occupied",
    "this is not an efficient procedure because it requires examining every bond each time @xmath12 is changed .",
    "instead we do the following .",
    "each processor creates a random permutation of the @xmath47 bonds in its cell .",
    "this permutation determines the order in which bonds will be tested by the processor . on the first step , processor @xmath48",
    "tests its first @xmath49 bonds where @xmath49 is chosen from the binomial distribution , @xmath50 $ ] for @xmath47 trials with success probability @xmath40 .",
    "this is statistically equivalent to testing all bonds with random numbers less than @xmath40 as described in the previous paragraph .",
    "suppose that spanning is not found , then @xmath40 is incremented to @xmath42 .",
    "at this point processor @xmath48 has permanently occupied @xmath51 bonds .",
    "processor @xmath48 now tests the next @xmath52 bonds where now @xmath52 is chosen from @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "this process of occupying bonds continues as long as the stopping condition is not fulfilled and on the @xmath54th such step the number of occupied bonds is incremented according to @xmath55 .",
    "suppose that spanning is first detected on step @xmath43 and that @xmath56 bonds have been provisionally occupied by processor @xmath48 during this step .",
    "on the next step each processor tries to occupy a smaller number of bonds corresponding to splitting the difference between @xmath44 and @xmath45 . to do this , processor @xmath48 tests the next @xmath57 bonds starting with the @xmath58th bond where",
    "@xmath57 is chosen from @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "a little reflection shows that this procedure is statistically equivalent to the one described above for carrying out the binary search .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that on successive steps it is not necessary to check every bond in the cell .",
    "note that the local ordering of bonds is fully specified at the outset of the bond move but that the global ordering of the bonds is generated as needed and never fully specified .",
    "we tested the parallel ic algorithm for the two - dimensional ising model on a 32-node cm-5 machine .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows that the number of relaxation cycles @xmath60 per mc step as a function of system size @xmath20 . the roughly logarithmic increase in @xmath60 results from the binary search method used to find @xmath18 .",
    "we separately measured the time spent in local cluster growth @xmath61 and relaxation @xmath62 .",
    "the local time increases as the number of spins per node , thus , for a fixed number of processors , @xmath63 .",
    "the relaxation time is dominated by communication between nodes so @xmath62 is proportional to the boundary area of the local lattice and the number of relaxation cycles , @xmath64 .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows local and relaxation times as a function of system size . the relaxation time is greater for small systems but , when the number of spins per node exceeds several hundred thousand the local time dominates .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we compare the performance of the parallel ic algorithm with that of the parallel sw algorithm for the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "the total time per spin per mc step for both algorithms decreases as the system size increases and saturates for large systems . for large systems in both two and three dimensions ,",
    "the time for one mc step for the parallel ic algorithm is about a factor of @xmath65 larger than for the parallel sw algorithm .",
    "we obtained @xmath66s per spin per mc step for the parallel ic algorithm for the two - dimensional ising models with system size @xmath0 on the 32-node cm-5 machine and @xmath67s per spin per mc step for the three - dimensional ising model on the same machine and with the same number of spins ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the slower speed for three - dimensions results from the need for more communications between nodes since each node has six neighbors rather than four .",
    "for both two and three dimensions the time per spin per mc step decreases as the system size increases .",
    "the relaxation time is , however , still comparable to the local time for @xmath68 , so the parallel ic algorithm for the three - dimensional ising model can be expected to become more efficient as the system size increases holding the number of processors fixed .    to test the sensitivity of the algorithm to the random number generator , we performed simulations using two different random number generators .",
    "most of the data is collected using the 250-shift generator in which new random numbers are produced by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 are 32-bit integers and @xmath71 represents the bitwise exclusive or operation .",
    "we also tested a combined shift register generator , introduced in ref .",
    "the combined generator consists of two shift registers @xmath72 and @xmath73 with 32-bit integers @xmath74 .",
    "new random numbers of the generator are combined by @xmath75 .",
    "we observed no difference between results from the two generators .",
    "for example , the mean value of @xmath18 for system size @xmath76 was measured as @xmath77 for the first generator and @xmath78 for the second .",
    "we studied the three - dimensional ising model using the parallel ic algorithm for system sizes @xmath79 to @xmath1 . unless otherwise stated we used the 1-span rule . for each run",
    "we allowed 200 mc steps for equilibration before collecting data .",
    "independent runs consisted of @xmath80 mc steps for the smallest systems ( up to @xmath81 ) to @xmath82 mc steps for the largest system ( 512@xmath5 ) . for each size",
    ", a number of independent runs were made .",
    "we obtained statistics for @xmath18 and the size of the spanning cluster .",
    "error bars represent the standard error ( one standard deviation ) associated with these independent runs .",
    "the data for the 1-span rule is given in table i.    figure [ fig : fig4 ] is a double logarithmic plot of @xmath83 vs.  system size .",
    "a fit of the form @xmath84 , yields @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this result strongly supports the hypothesis that @xmath87 approaches zero as a power law .    the finite - size scaling hypothesis , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fss ] ) implies an asymptotically linear relation between @xmath21 and @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig8 ] shows plots of @xmath21 against @xmath87 for the three @xmath15-span rules . although these plots are consistent with asymptotic linear behavior , it is clear that there are large subleading corrections to scaling . for the 1-span rule",
    "these corrections are negative and for the 3-span rule they are positive .",
    "figure [ fig : fig5 ] shows more detail for the 1-span rule where , over the range of system sizes studied , @xmath21 varies only in the fifth significant digit .",
    "however , to obtain yet higher accuracy than @xmath88 requires either larger system sizes or a good fit to the subleading terms .",
    "fitting to the form @xmath89 we obtain @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the corresponding critical coupling , quoted with two standard deviation errors , is @xmath93 .",
    "the fit is shown as a dotted line in the figure .",
    "the primary difficulty in obtaining a high precision value of the critical coupling is the relatively large corrections to scaling , represented by the fact that the fitting parameter @xmath94 is a good deal larger than @xmath95 .",
    "our estimate of the critical coupling is consistent with recent values  @xcite ( e.g. @xmath96 @xcite ) but the error is much larger .",
    "figure [ fig : median ] shows the median value of @xmath18 for the 1-span rule versus @xmath87 .",
    "according to the finite - size scaling hypothesis this plot should also be linear and , indeed , approximately linear behavior is evidenced over the whole range of system sizes however it should be noted that the variation in the median is much larger than for the mean .",
    "furthermore , errors in the mean are less . thus appears that the mean is a better estimator of the critical coupling .",
    "we measured the mass ( the number of sites ) @xmath25 of the spanning clusters .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) we can find the fractal dimension of the spanning cluster and the magnetic exponent . the double logarithmic plot of @xmath25 and @xmath20 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] shows that the data is well described by a power law and an examination of different ranges of system size yields no clear trends in the power . a linear fit for @xmath97 yields @xmath98 consistent with a recent value @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "next we consider the dynamical properties of the algorithm .",
    "the normalized autocorrelation function of an observable @xmath100 is defined by , @xmath101 where @xmath102 is time in monte carlo steps .",
    "figure [ fig : fig9 ] shows the autocorrelation function for @xmath18 for a 128@xmath5 system .",
    "the striking feature of this curve is that it is negative on time step 1 indicating anti - correlations between successive mc steps . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite these anti - correlations are associated with the negative feedback mechanism that forces ic dynamics to the critical point . by the fourth step it is not possible to distinguish the autocorrelation function from zero .",
    "the integrated autocorrelation time @xmath103 is defined by ,    @xmath104    @xmath105    using the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we measured integrated autocorrelation times for the magnetization @xmath54 , energy @xmath106 and temperature estimator @xmath18 .",
    "the autocorrelation times are given in table ii and plotted against system size in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "due to these anti - correlations @xmath107 and @xmath108 _ decrease _ with system size ; @xmath109 remains nearly constant .",
    "thus ic dynamics for the three - dimensional ising model apparently does not suffer critical slowing .",
    "( although , as is the case for all cluster algorithms , the parallel time needed for a single mc step must increases logarithmically with the system size @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamic exponent @xmath110 is defined by @xmath111 .",
    "we obtained the dynamic exponents @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 for @xmath54 , @xmath106 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : fig10 ] shows @xmath115 as a function of @xmath116 .",
    "it appears that the infinite volume limit for @xmath115 lies between between @xmath117 and @xmath118 . since @xmath119",
    "there must be corresponding positive values summing to at least @xmath120 to @xmath121 for @xmath122",
    ". it would be interesting to have more information about the infinite volume limit of the @xmath18 autocorrelation function .",
    "the autocorrelation function is related to the standard error , @xmath123 in measuring @xmath124 according to , @xmath125 with @xmath126 and @xmath127 the number of monte carlo steps . in most monte carlo applications",
    "the second term is much smaller than the first however for the ic algorithm this may not be the case since @xmath128 .",
    "the autocorrelation function for @xmath18 is approximately @xmath129 for @xmath130 and small for @xmath131 so that the approximate error in measuring the critical coupling is @xmath132 suppose that the number of mc steps is large enough that @xmath133 as is the case here for the smaller system sizes . combining the scaling behavior of @xmath107 and of @xmath87 we have , for @xmath134 , @xmath135 on the other hand , if @xmath107 and @xmath136 are comparable as is the case here for the largest lattices then @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we used a parallel implementation of the invaded cluster algorithm to study two- and three - dimensional ising models .",
    "we have found that the parallel algorithm is quite efficient for large system sizes where most computational work is carried out constructing clusters within processing nodes and relatively little time is spent in communication .",
    "we have shown that the invaded cluster algorithm has no critical slowing down for the three - dimensional ising model as measured by integrated autocorrelation times for the magnetization , energy or estimated critical temperature .",
    "indeed , the integrated autocorrelation time for the latter two quantities approaches zero as the system size grows so that relatively few monte carlo steps are needed for high accuracy estimates of the finite - size critical energy or critical temperature .",
    "on the other hand , extrapolation to the infinite volume limit for quantities such as the critical temperature is complicated by the absence of a well - understood finite - size scaling theory for the invaded cluster ensemble .",
    "we have examined the hypothesis that the distribution of @xmath18 is controlled by a single scale factor and found that this apparently holds for large systems ( greater than @xmath139 ) but that there are significant corrections to the predicted asymptotic linear dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath87 .",
    "this is not unexpected since the width of the @xmath18 distribution is rather large compared to @xmath140 .",
    "thus relatively small corrections to scaling for the @xmath18 distribution can lead to relatively large deviations from the proposed linear behavior of @xmath21 vs.  @xmath87 .",
    "this means that to confidently reduce systematic errors in estimating the infinite volume critical temperature we would either have to go to much larger systems to make @xmath87 small or we would need a detailed understanding of the corrections to scaling in the ic ensemble .",
    "our current estimates of the critical temperature using the ic method are consistent with the best conventional estimates but have errors which are about an order of magnitude larger .",
    "in contrast to the critical temperature , corrections to scaling in measuring the critical dimension of the spanning cluster are very small and we are able to obtain an excellent estimate of the magnetic exponent . our result is @xmath141(@xmath3 ) .",
