    "in the last paragraph of the _ origin _ , darwin ( 1859 , p. 490 ) says that , in the beginning , life was breathed `` into a few forms , or into one . ''",

    "so which epistemological principle is right  that _ all _ adaptive similarities provide only meager evidence for common ancestry , or that _ some _ adaptive similarities provide weak evidence while others provide strong ? if the latter , how can the one sort of adaptive similarity be separated from the other ?",
    "darwin s prose suggests an answer to this last question : perhaps the shared framework of bones is strong evidence for common ancestry because it is used for different purposes in these different groups .",

    "argued that the universality of the genetic code is strong evidence for common ancestry .",
    "modern biology has retained his conclusion even though we now know that the genetic code is nt universal ; it is _ nearly _ universal , with almost all groups of organisms using one code and a few others using codes that are very similar , but not identical , to the one ( knight , freeland , and landweber 2001 ) .",
    "the prevalent genetic code provides strong evidence for common ancestry even though it has the same purpose in all the living things that have it .",
    "to sort out darwin s ideas concerning evidence for common ancestry , we need two concepts  one qualitative , the other quantitative . the former is provided by the law of likelihood ( hacking 1965 ) :    * ( qual ) * observation @xmath1 favors hypothesis @xmath2 over hypothesis @xmath3 if and only if @xmath4    we will use this epistemological principle when we describe a fairly general set of assumptions in section 3 that entails that    @xmath5    qual takes this inequality to mean that the similarity connecting @xmath6 and @xmath7 favors the hypothesis of common ancestry ( ca ) over the hypothesis of separate ancestry ( sa ) .",
    "however , qual does not provide the resources for describing how the type of evolutionary process affects the degree to which the similarity favors ca over sa .",
    "for this purpose we will use + * ( quant ) * the degree to which @xmath1 favors @xmath2 over @xmath3 is given by the likelihood ratio @xmath8 + given that taxa @xmath6 and @xmath7 share trait @xmath0 , we will compare how strongly this similarity favors ca over sa when @xmath9 is the evolutionary process that governed the evolution of @xmath0 with how strongly the similarity favors ca over sa when @xmath10 is the process at work .",
    "this will involve comparing two likelihood ratios :    @xmath11    we consider which pairs of processes are related by this inequality in sections 4 - 6 .",
    "inspired by reichenbach s ( 1956 ) discussion of his principle of the common cause , we here describe a sufficient condition for a dichotomous trait shared by taxa @xmath6 and @xmath7 to favor the hypothesis that @xmath6 and @xmath7 have a common ancestor over the hypothesis that they do not .",

    "[ reich ] under assumptions a1a5 , extended to allow @xmath30 states , @xmath41    although the argument for proposition  [ reich ] goes through , the fact that the evolving trait is nt dichotomous opens the door to possible violations of assumption 5 .",
    "an example is depicted in the accompanying table . in the branch leading to taxon @xmath6 , there is strong selection for @xmath42 if the common ancestor @xmath43 is in state @xmath44 , but strong stablizing selection prevents @xmath42 from evolving if @xmath43 is in state @xmath45 and also prevents @xmath45 from evolving if @xmath43 is in state @xmath42 . in the lineage leading to taxon @xmath7 ,",
    "the situation is just the reverse : there is strong selection for @xmath42 if the ancestor is in state @xmath45 , but stabilizing selection prevents @xmath44 from evolving into @xmath42 , and also prevents @xmath42 from evolving into @xmath44 .",
    "this difference in the processes governing trait evolution in the two branches gives rise to the two probabilistic inequalities described in the table ; together , they violate assumption 5 .",
    "suppose that ancestors ( in both the common ancestry and the separate ancestry models ) have @xmath44 , @xmath42 , and @xmath45 with probabilities 0.49 , 0.02 , and 0.49 , respectively .",
    "the result is that if taxa @xmath6 and @xmath7 are both in state @xmath42 , this similarity will favor separate ancestry over common ancestry .",
    "the likelihood of the common ancestry hypothesis is approximately 0.02 , whereas the likelihood of the separate ancestry hypothesis is about @xmath46 .",
    "[ fig1_sober ]    our analysis in this section concerns two taxa .",
    "if there are more than two , the taxa can differ in how closely related they are to each other under the common ancestry hypothesis .",
    "we address this complication in section 7 .",
    "our results so far lend support to darwin s intuition that similarity is evidence for common ancestry . the assumptions needed to derive this result are nt _ a priori _ but they are very widely satisfied .",
    "we now turn to the question of which processes strengthen the evidence that a similarity provides for common ancestry and which processes weaken that evidence .",
    "we begin with a simple argument presented by sober and steel ( 2014a ) .",
    "the likelihood ratio of ca to sa can be expanded as follows :    @xmath48    if we use assumption 1 above , that    @xmath49    and assume further that the evolutionary process is uniform ( meaning that simultaneous branches have the same probabilities of changing state ) , so that    @xmath50    the likelihood ratio becomes : @xmath51 suppose , finally , that if @xmath6 and @xmath7 have a common ancestor , then the amount of time between @xmath6 and @xmath7 and their most recent common ancestor is very small .",
    "this entails that the likelihood ratio is approximately @xmath47 .",
    "given that this likelihood ratio gets bigger as @xmath52 gets smaller , there is a simple argument for an implication of darwin s thesis that adaptive similarities provide little evidence for common ancestry .",
    "the argument does not describe the absolute amount of evidence that adaptive similarities provide , but it does say the following : if the value for @xmath52 when @xmath0 is adaptive is greater than the value for @xmath52 when @xmath0 is neutral or deleterious , then neutral and deleterious similarities provide stronger evidence for common ancestry than adaptive similarities do .",
    "we will see in what follows that there are counterexamples to the consequent of the conditional just stated ; there are adaptive similarities that provide stronger evidence for common ancestry than neutral similarities provide .",
    "even so , the @xmath47 argument is a good starting point .",
    "argument are presented in sober ( 2008 , pp . 297305 ; 2011 , p. 30 ) . ]",
    "the argument has two limitations .",
    "the first , that the argument is formulated for just two taxa , will be removed in section  [ beyond ] .",
    "the second limitation is the assumption that if @xmath6 and @xmath7 have a common ancestor , they have a very recent common ancestor .",
    "this limitation can be lifted by considering a markovian process of character state evolution . for computational convenience , in this paper we consider the simplest model that allows different traits to have different probabilities , namely the _ equal input model_. this model , for an @xmath30-state character @xmath0 , says that for all states @xmath53 different from @xmath54 , @xmath55 ( semple and steel 2003 ) . except where we consider directional selection",
    ", we will suppose the equal input model is stationary .",
    "any stationary equal input model involving any number of states entails the following succinct representation of the likelihood ratio ( sober and steel , 2014a ) :    @xmath56    here the most recent common ancestor of @xmath6 and @xmath7 postulated by the ca model is @xmath29 units of time in the past , @xmath52 is the stationary probability of trait @xmath0 , and @xmath57 is a scaled rate of substitution between states .",
    "notice that the likelihood ratio in ( [ sobeq ] ) is greater than unity when @xmath29 is any finite positive number ( though it asymptotically approaches unity as @xmath29 is made large ) and that the ratio is made large by making @xmath52 small .",
    "later , we will see that eqn .",
    "( [ sobeq ] ) also falls out as a corollary of proposition  [ thm1 ] .",
    "under ca , suppose that the root of the 2-taxon tree is in state @xmath0 with probability @xmath58 , and that @xmath59 is the stationary probability for state @xmath0 .",
    "thus the probability @xmath52 that a present day taxon is in state @xmath0 lies between @xmath58 and @xmath59 , so either @xmath60 ( neutrality ) or @xmath61 ( selection for trait @xmath0 ) or @xmath62 ( selection against trait @xmath0 ) when @xmath63 . in the equal input model ,",
    "the probability of being in state @xmath0 if the process was in state @xmath64 at @xmath29 units in the past is @xmath65 when @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 . therefore : @xmath69 + ( 1-q)[(1-e^{-rt}],\\ ] ] which simplifies to the relationship : @xmath70 for @xmath29 small , @xmath52 is close to @xmath58 ( with equality at @xmath71 ) and for @xmath29 large , @xmath52 is close to @xmath59 ( with equality in the limit as @xmath72 ) .",
    "it is convenient to think of @xmath59 and @xmath58 as given , with @xmath52 determined by these quantities ( and @xmath73 ) via eqn .",

    "that is : @xmath78    we now consider the ratio @xmath79 of two likelihood ratios .",
    "one of them is the likelihood ratio for directional selection ( @xmath74 ) when @xmath80 ; the other is the likelihood ratio for drift ( @xmath77 ) , given by eqn .",
    "( [ pp2 ] ) . in both cases the two taxa",
    "are observed to have trait @xmath0 .",
    "thus , @xmath81 notice that the numerator of @xmath79 involves a non - stationary process while the denominator characterizes a stationary process ( with the stationary probability of state @xmath0 being equal to @xmath58 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath82 since otherwise the probability of observing trait @xmath0 at the present , according to the equilibrium ( drift ) model , is @xmath83 ( under either ca or sa ) .",
    "this framework allows us to derive the following proposition , which describes how the difference between directional selection and drift affects the degree to which a similarity favors common over separate ancestry :    [ rhodir ]    * for all @xmath63 , @xmath84 if @xmath85 ( selection against the trait ) and @xmath86 if @xmath87 ( selection for the trait ) . *",
    "if @xmath88 or @xmath89 then @xmath90 for all @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , @xmath91 and @xmath92 both equal @xmath93 .",

    "an ancestor ( @xmath29 units in the past ) has probability @xmath58 of being in state @xmath0 . in two of the curves ,",
    "selection is compared with drift when there is selection against trait @xmath0 , which is observed in the two leaves ; in the third curve , selection is compared with drift when there is selection for the trait found in the leaves .",

    "figure  [ figy ] shows three graphs of @xmath79  one compares selection with drift when there is selection for trait @xmath0 while the other two make the comparison when there is selection against trait @xmath0 ( without loss of generality , we have taken @xmath94 ) .",
    "proposition  [ rhodir ] says that these behaviours are generic and provides a formal statement that accords with darwin s idea that adaptive characters provide less support for ca than non - adaptive characters do .",
    "in fact , our result replaces darwin s two types of similarity with three : in an equal input model of directional selection , deleterious similarities are better than neutral similarities , and neutral similarities are better than adaptive similarities in terms of how much they favor ca over sa .",

    "consider the following ratio of likelihood - ratio values @xmath95 under the equal input model on @xmath96 states and two taxa .",
    "the numerator represents the likelihood ratio of common ancestry to separate ancestry when there is stabilizing selection ( ss ) ; the denominator represents that ratio when there is drift ( d ) .",
    "suppose @xmath52 is the stationary probability of state @xmath0 , and that @xmath97 and @xmath98 denote the substitution rates under drift and stabilising selection , where @xmath99 . from ( [ sobeq ] )",
    "it follows directly that : @xmath100 in this setting stablizing selection inflates the likelihood ratio of ca over sa , and when the states have equal probability , the maximal inflation in the likelihood ratio grows according to a power law in the number of states :    [ rhostab ]    * for all @xmath63 , @xmath101 .",

    "notice also that when @xmath111 then @xmath113 in agreement with ( b)(i ) .",
    "figure  [ figx ] illustrates the behaviour of @xmath103 as a function of @xmath96 and the ratio @xmath114 .",
    "it is useful to consider how this analysis of stabilizing selection versus drift is related to the @xmath115 argument described earlier .",
    "consider equation ( [ condeq ] ) , which holds regardless of how much time the common ancestry hypothesis says there is from taxa @xmath6 and @xmath7 back to their most recent common ancestor . if drift and stabilizing selection assign the same value to @xmath52 , how can the likelihood ratio of ca to sa be greater when there is stabilizing selection than when there is drift ?",
    "the answer is that @xmath116 has a higher value when there is stabilizing selection than when there is drift .",
    "this is easily seen , since the models used for both processes are stationary and time - reversible .",
    "proposition  [ rhostab ] shows that darwin overgeneralized when he said that adaptive similarities provide almost no evidence for common ancestry .",
    "an adaptive similarity provides stronger evidence than a neutral similarity when the adaptive character evolves by stabilizing selection in an equal input model .",
    "it is arguable that the  framework of bones \" that darwin discussed and the near universality of the genetic code that we mentioned earlier each provide strong evidence for common ancestry because their evolution was governed by stabilizing selection .",
    "in proposition  [ reich ] , we described a very general sufficient condition for a trait shared by two taxa to favor common ancestry over separate ancestry . here",
    "we address a complication that arises when more than two taxa are considered .",
    "the complication is that if more than two taxa have a common ancestor , there are different tree topologies that might connect those taxa to each other .",
    "thus , the hypothesis of common ancestry is a disjunction in which each disjunct is a different tree topology .",
    "how is the likelihood of this disjunction to be compared with the likelihood of the separate ancestry hypothesis when @xmath30 leaf taxa all have the same trait value ?",
    "we address this question by identifying the tree topology that has the highest likelihood and the one that has the lowest likelihood ; this means that the likelihood of the common ancestry disjunction must fall somewhere in between .",
    "suppose @xmath30 taxa share state @xmath0 , and under ca have a most recent common ancestor @xmath29 time units in the past .",
    "assume an equal input model of character state change in equilibrium ( i.e. drift or stabilizing selection , but not directional selection ) in which state @xmath0 has stationary probability @xmath117 .",
    "we consider two extreme scenarios for the tree linking these @xmath30 taxa under ca :    * * star tree : * this tree has all @xmath30 leaves adjacent to the root vertex , with edges of temporal length @xmath29 . for this tree it is readily verified that : @xmath118 * * delayed tree : * consider a tree that has two edges both of length @xmath29 , connecting the root to two leaves .",
    "if each of the remaining @xmath119 leaves is attached to one or other of these leaves by edges of length zero , then we obtain a tree we call a ` delayed tree ' . for a delayed tree",
    "it is readily verified that : @xmath120    notice that when @xmath121 , simple algebra shows that the two expressions on the right for @xmath122 agree , and equal the expression in eqn .",
    "( [ sobeq ] ) , which is to be expected since for two leaves the star and delayed tree are identical , and this is the only tree shape possible .",
    "figure  [ fig1ca ] illustrates the star and delayed trees , on either side of a ` typical ' binary phylogenetic tree ( note that ( c ) shows only an approximation to a delayed tree , since edges of length zero are difficult to see ! ) .",
    "[ thm1 ] for any fixed parameters ( @xmath123 ) , where @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , the likelihood ratio @xmath122 is minimized when the underlying tree ( under ca ) is a star tree , and it is maximised by any delayed tree .",
    "this result has a number of immediate consequences :    1 .",
    "@xmath126 for all finite @xmath63 .",
    "that is , a shared trait always favors ca over sa under the equal input model .",
    "2 .   when @xmath34 this proposition ( and the formula ( [ starp ] ) for @xmath127 for the star tree ) improves on the lower bound from sober and steel ( 2014a , proposition 1 ) that stated the lower bound @xmath128 which grows exponentially with @xmath30 when @xmath129 . however , the star bound is better since it grows exponentially with @xmath30 regardless of the size of @xmath130 .",
    "the result for the star tree in proposition  [ thm1 ] might seem completely as expected .",
    "some caution is in order , however , since a related question led to the surprising finding that the star tree is the ` extreme case ' for certain types of equal input models , but not for others . more precisely , the star tree maximizes the mutual information between the states at the leaves and the root state for an equal input model on two equally probable states ( evans et al .",
    "however , the star tree can fail to maximize mutual information when the equal input model has five or more equally probable states , provided the number of leaves is sufficiently large , and the branch lengths lie in a certain range ( sly , 2011 ) .",
    "the idea that similarity is evidence for common ancestry has exceptions , but it holds in a very general circumstance , which we described by enumerating five assumptions .",
    "three of these are familiar from the literature on causal modeling : intermediate probabilities , screening - off , and ancestor independence ( spirtes , glymour , and sheines 2000 ; pearl 2009 ) .",
    "two further assumptions are more specific to the literature on phylogenetic inference : cross - model homogeneity and cross - branch homogeneity .",
    "we noted that the last of these is not an inevitable consequence of evolutionary theory .",
    "if it is violated , a similarity can favor separate ancestry over common ancestry . and",
    "even when the evolving trait obeys the five assumptions , tree topology complicates the likelihood comparison of common ancestry and separate ancestry ; we explained how an equal - input model permits the comparison to go forward when there are more than two leaf taxa .",
    "turning to the question of which similarities provide stronger evidence for common ancestry than which others , we began with a simple argument for the following thesis : the sharing of trait @xmath0 among two leaf taxa provides stronger evidence for common ancestry the less probable it is that a taxon has trait @xmath0 .",
    "this is the @xmath47 argument of section  [ 1psec ] .",
    "the main limitation of this argument is that it assumes that if two taxa have a common ancestor , their most recent common ancestor was in the very recent past .",
    "our analysis in sections [ dirsec ] and [ stasec ] dropped that assumption , but our results show that the @xmath47 argument was on the right track , at least in part . when the selection process is directional selection , deleterious similarities are better than neutral similarities , and neutral similarities are better than adaptive similarities .",
    "darwin s comment that an adaptive similarity is  almost valueless \" is correct if the adaptive similarity is due to directional selection .",
    "however , when stabilizing selection is considered instead of directional selection , the situation is more subtle .    under an equal - input model ,",
    "adaptive similarities that are the product of stabilizing selection are better than neutral similarities .",
    "this means that the @xmath47 argument is mistaken in this instance , since stabilizing selection and neutral evolution can assign the same probability to a taxon s having trait @xmath0 .",
    "our results concerning the impact of different evolutionary processes on the ratio of the likelihoods of common ancestry and separate ancestry are summarized in figure  [ fig_final ] .",
    "although the @xmath47 argument goes wrong in judging that stabilizing selection and drift are in the same boat when they assign the same probability to a taxon s having trait @xmath0 , reducing the value of @xmath52 still plays a role in comparing these two processes",
    ". the maximal extent to which stabilizing selection can favor ca over sa , compared with drift , depends on @xmath52 ; figure  [ figx ] makes this plain for the special case of equally probable states . in that case , @xmath131 ( where @xmath96 is the number of states ) and the maximum degree to which stablizing selection favors ca over sa , compared with drift , becomes large as @xmath52 becomes small  this maximal ratio is described by a @xmath132 relationship ( when the drift substitution rate is twice the stabilizing selection substitution rate ) but moves closer to a @xmath47 relationship as the ratio of these two substitution rates grows .    . ]",
    "notice also that in both figure  [ rhodir ] and figure  [ figx ] , the likelihood advantage of one process over another sets in when @xmath63 and disappears as @xmath29 approaches infinity .",
    "this is a pattern that should be expected in markov processes that allow transitions from any state to any other state by some sequence of steps ( sober and steel 2014b ) .",
    "although we used an equal - input model to represent stabilizing selection , the fact remains that stabilizing selection does not require an equal - input model .",
    "this raises the question of how the difference between stabilizing selection and neutral evolution would affect the likelihood comparison of common and separate ancestry were stabilizing selection reconceptualized .",
