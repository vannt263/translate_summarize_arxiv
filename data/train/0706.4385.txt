    "differential geometry has proven to be highly valuable in extracting the geometric meaning of continuum vector theories .",
    "of particular interest has been the dirac - khler formulation of fermionic field theory @xcite , which uses the antisymmetry inherent in the product between differential forms to describe the clifford algebra . in order to regularize calculations ,",
    "we are required to introduce a discrete differential geometry scheme and it would be ideal if this had the same properties as the continuum and the correct continuum limit .",
    "however , defining such a scheme has proven to be very challenging .",
    "the difficulties are usually exhibited by the hodge star , which maps a form to its complement in the space , and the wedge product between forms . in a discretization , we would like the latter to allow the product rule to be satisfied and we would like both to be local .",
    "several discrete schemes have been proposed that address these difficulties with varying success .",
    "becher and joos @xcite used a lattice to define operators with many desirable properties , but that were non - local . to resolve the non - locality , they introduced translation operators .",
    "kanamori and kawamoto @xcite also used a lattice and introduced a specific non - commutativity between the fields and discrete forms .",
    "this allowed the product rule to be fulfilled , but they found that it became necessary to introduce a second orientation of form in order for their action to remain hermitian . instead of a lattice , balachandran _ et al _",
    "@xcite used a quantized phase space to regularize their system , leading to a fuzzy coordinate space @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall build upon a proposal by adams @xcite in which he introduces two parallel lattices to maintain the locality of the hodge star and uses a finite element scheme to capture the properties of the wedge product .",
    "this proposal describes a local , discrete differential geometry for an arbitrary topological space and its formal aspects have been thoroughly studied by de beauc , samik sen , siddartha sen and czech @xcite .",
    "however , here we want to focus on its application to the dirac - khler formulation .    in lattice",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( lattice qcd ) calculations , it is common to see the staggered fermion formulation used to describe fermions @xcite .",
    "this formulation addresses the problem of fermion doubling @xcite by reducing the number of degenerate fermions to @xmath0 in @xmath1 dimensional space - time .",
    "it is frequently used with the quarter - root trick @xcite to provide a description of a single fermion on the lattice , although this approach has attracted some controversy @xcite .",
    "the continuous dirac - khler formulation is regarded as providing the continuum limit for the staggered fermion formulation and so a discrete dirac - khler formulation with continuum properties can potentially offer great insight into how to develop non - degenerate , doubler - free fermionic field theories for the lattice .    in this paper , we show how the two lattices of adams proposal can be used to describe chiral symmetry in the associated dirac - khler formulation .",
    "we also see how the idea of using more than one lattice can be extended to describe an exact flavour projection .",
    "we find that this necessitates the introduction of two new structures of lattice and a new operator .",
    "finally , we evaluate the path integral for this formulation , considering the effects of chiral and flavour projection .",
    "this builds on our previous work @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the _ complex _ , which is the space on which we define the discrete differential geometry .",
    "it comprises the points of the lattice , together with the links , faces , volumes and hyper - volumes between the points .",
    "each point , link , face , volume or hyper - volume is an example of a _ simplex _ and each simplex has an accompanying cochain .",
    "we denote a cochain by the vertices of its corresponding simplex .",
    "for example , we write the cochain for the simplex between vertices @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 from fig .",
    "[ twod ] as @xmath6 $ ] .",

    "will leave the degrees of freedom belonging to the upper components of the first column of @xmath159 on the original complex of set @xmath2 and the lower components of the first column of @xmath159 on the original complex of set @xmath3 .",

    "can now be used to isolate a non - degenerate , chiral dirac - khler fermion on each complex .",
    "the flavour and chiral projections have important consequences for the path integral . if we initially consider only flavour projection , the action must include contributions from all four complexes .",
    "@xmath175 where , on each complex , we have @xmath176 @xmath159 contributes different degrees of freedom to the fields on each complex whose cochains are related by @xmath118 and @xmath78 , so we can write the path integral as the product of four path integrals @xmath177[d\\tilde{\\phi}_i]e^{-s_i(\\tilde{\\bar{\\phi}}_i,\\tilde{\\phi}_i)}\\right)^{l_0 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath178 is an as yet undefined constant .",
    "because each complex lies in a separate space , we can evaluate each contribution separately and , on each complex , we have the standard result @xmath179[d\\tilde{\\phi}_i]\\left(e^{-<\\tilde{\\bar{\\phi}}_i ,    ( d-\\delta)\\tilde{\\phi}_i>}\\right)^{l_0 } = det\\left[(d-\\delta)\\right]^{l_0 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath36 is defined as a matrix operator .",
    "consequently , the full path integral takes the form @xmath180^{4l_0}\\ ] ] and for this to have the correct continuum limit , we require that @xmath181 .",
    "interestingly , this means that the form of the path integral on each complex , prior to flavour projection , is @xmath179[d\\tilde{\\phi}_i]\\left(e^{-<\\tilde{\\bar{\\phi}}_i ,    ( d-\\delta)\\tilde{\\phi}_i>}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4 } } , \\ ] ] which is exactly equivalent to that used in the quarter - root trick of lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "applying flavour projection to this system changes the relationship between @xmath38 and @xmath159 so that @xmath182 and @xmath183 each describe the degrees of freedom belonging to one column of @xmath184 and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "this applies to the measures of integration as well as the fields in the action .",
    "one consequence of this projection is that several fields on each complex come to share the same structure in terms of @xmath185 , @xmath56 and @xmath159 .",
    "for example , after flavour projection , referring to fig .",
    "[ twod ] , @xmath186)=\\psi(x)_1^{(1)}|_{x = a } , \\hspace{1 cm } \\tilde{\\phi}_o([abcd])=-\\int_{abcd}dx^1\\wedge dx^2 \\psi(x)_1^{(1 ) } \\ .\\ ] ] however , because these fields are integrated over different domains , they are independent and the path integral is evaluated in the same way to give @xmath187 .",
    "if we now extend the path integral so that the action permits chiral projection , we must include the contribution from both sets of complexes .",
    "the action becomes @xmath188 and , prior to flavour projection , we can evaluate the path integral separately on each complex to obtain @xmath189^{8l_0 } , \\ ] ] which requires us to set @xmath190 , in order to obtain the correct continuum limit . applying both chiral and flavour projection to this system , as in the previous section , changes the relationship between @xmath38 and @xmath159 so that the path integral comes to be a product of four , single flavour , right - handed path integrals and four , single flavour , left - handed path integrals .",
    "as in the previous case , fields sharing a similar structure of @xmath185 , @xmath56 and @xmath159 are independent because their domains of integration differ .",
    "however , because the components of @xmath99 on each complex can be unambiguously described as left or right handed , the chiral projection sends half the components to zero .",
    "consequently , the effective dimension of @xmath36 is halved on each complex .",
    "here we have shown that it is possible to describe exact chiral symmetry for dirac - khler fermions using the two complexes of the geometric discretization .",
    "we have extended this idea to describe exact flavour projection and we have shown that this necessitated the introduction of two new structures of complex as well as a new operator . to describe simultaneous chiral and flavour projection",
    ", we introduced a duplicate set of complexes and we were required to carefully define chiral projection so that it operates between sets and flavour projection so that it operates within sets .",
    "this allowed us to project a single flavour of chiral field onto each complex .",
    "we have observed that evaluating the path integral on each of the four complexes , prior to flavour projection and without the provision for simultaneous chiral projection , leads to a form equivalent to that used in the quarter - root trick of lattice qcd .",
