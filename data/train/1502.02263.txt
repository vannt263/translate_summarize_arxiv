    "it is nowadays well recognized that an important class of observables at particle colliders are transverse - momentum distributions of final state events . while a transverse - momentum ( @xmath4 ) distribution can be described within the standard collinear factorization approach for large @xmath4 , it is convenient and sometimes necessary to resort to an alternative factorization approach for small @xmath4 , typically @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the proton mass and @xmath7 the hard scale of the process under investigation .",
    "this alternative approach , called transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) factorization ( see e.g. ref .  ) , takes into account the transverse motion of partons w.r.t .",
    "the direction of the parent proton . in this picture",
    "the small final - state transverse momentum @xmath4 is a consequence of the parton transverse momenta .",
    "hence , the non - perturbative distribution functions entering a tmd factorization formula not only depend on the collinear momentum fractions @xmath8 , but also on the transverse momentum @xmath9 .",
    "+ the information on the transverse - momentum dependence of unpolarized and linearly polarized gluons in an unpolarized proton is encapsulated in the following tmd correlator @xmath10 , which describes the transition from a proton to a gluon , such that @xmath11}^{n[\\text{--}]}\\ , f^{n\\mu}(\\xi)\\ , { \\mathcal{u}}_{[\\xi,0]}^{n[\\text{-- } ] }            |p\\rangle \\big]_{\\xi \\cdot p^\\prime = 0}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\frac{1}{2x } \\bigg \\{g_{{\\scriptscriptstyle t}}^{\\mu\\nu } f_1^g      -\\bigg(\\frac{p_{{\\scriptscriptstyle t}}^\\mu p_{{\\scriptscriptstyle t}}^\\nu}{m_p^2}\\ ,      { + } \\,g_{{\\scriptscriptstyle t}}^{\\mu\\nu}\\frac{{\\bm{p}_{{\\scriptscriptstyle t}}}^2}{2m_p^2}\\bigg )      h_1^{\\perp\\,g } \\bigg \\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the gluon four - momentum @xmath12 is decomposed as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a lightlike dimensionless vector , conjugated to the momentum @xmath15 of the parent proton , with no transverse components and satisfying the relation @xmath16 ( one assumes an analogous decomposition for @xmath17 and one takes @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , @xmath21 is the gluon field strength . at leading twist ,",
    "@xmath10 is parametrized@xcite in terms of the two gluon tmd distributions discussed above , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in eq .",

    "it runs from @xmath23 to @xmath24 via minus infinity along the @xmath14 direction .",
    "a model - independent positivity bound for @xmath25 was derived in ref .   and reads @xmath26 since it is @xmath27-even , @xmath3 does not necessarily vanish in absence of initial and final state interactions .",
    "this does not prevent it to be nonuniversal if it receives contributions from such interactions .",
    "a number of suggestions to measure these unknown tmds , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , have been discussed in the literature . whereas @xmath3 can ,",
    "in principle , be extracted from the azimuthal dependence of the dijet production in @xmath28 collisions@xcite , tmd - factorization breaking effects may be significant in this case due to the existence of both initial and final state interactions@xcite . to avoid these",
    ", one may prefer to rely on heavy - quark or dijet _",
    "electro_-production@xcite which would however only be studied at a future eic facility .",
    "diphoton production@xcite should also not be sensitive to factorization - breaking effects .",
    "it however suffers from a huge @xmath29 background and from contaminations from quark - induced channels at rhic energies which may preclude a clean gluon tmd extraction .",
    "it has recently been proposed@xcite to look at @xmath30 quarkonium production in the region where their transverse momentum is smaller than their mass .",
    "a one - loop analysis has shown that @xmath31 production may be safer@xcite than that of @xmath32 where color - octet contributions might spoil factorization@xcite .",
    "low-@xmath33 @xmath30 quarkonium production may however be very challenging at the lhc ; a first study of @xmath34 production has just been carried out by the lhcb but for @xmath35 gev .",
    "prospects are certainly more promising with the proposed lhc fixed - target experiment after@lhc(see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "we claim here that polarized and unpolarized gluon tmds can be accessed right now at the lhc through the reaction@xcite @xmath36 where now @xmath37 is one of the @xmath38 charmonium or bottomonium ( e.g.  @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) produced almost back - to - back with a photon . in this case",
    ", the momentum imbalance of the pair in the final state , @xmath39 , is small , but not the individual transverse momenta of the two particles",
    ". these should be well detectable by the atlas or cms detectors for instance . as we discussed in ref .",
    ", both these final states are always produced by gluon fusion ( this is in fact also true at lower energies@xcite ) , as illustrated by the thin and thicker curves on fig .",
    "[ crosssec ] . in this particular configuration , the process @xmath40 is expected to be dominated by the color - singlet contributions@xcite ( see the solid blue and dashed orange curves on fig .",
    "[ crosssec ] ) , hence tmd factorization should be applicable since the final - state interactions are expected to be suppressed . in the case of @xmath41 , a precise assessement of a possibe color - singlet dominance depends a more precise knowledge of color octet nrqcd matrix elements , which is still lacking@xcite . to be on the safe side and to single out the color - singlet contribution , it could be useful to isolate the @xmath0 .",
    "it may also be useful to measure @xmath41 production ( see ref .   and references therein ) in general in order to check the possible contribution from double - parton scatterings ( dps ) .",

    "the curves for the @xmath42 annihilation are respectively rescaled by a factor 100 ( 50 ) in a ) ( b ) ) . ]",
    "it has however recently been emphasised in an analysis of higgs plus jet production at the lhc@xcite that it may not be necessary to restrict the analyses to final states made only of colorless particles for the tmd factorisation to be applicable , provided that one of the particles used to measure the momentum imbalance is colorless .",
    "if this is the case , color - octet contributions to quarkonium + photon would not break the tmd factorisation . by extension , the study of the momentum imbalance in @xmath0 plus jet could also be used to extract gluon tmds . at this point ,",
    "let us mention that back - to - back @xmath43 , which has been studied by atlas@xcite , could also be used to extract gluon tmds .",
    "the arguments in favor of this observable are that it would probe them at higher scales ( @xmath44 ) and provide us with information on their evolution ( see ref .  ) , that in disfavor is the very small expected yield@xcite . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath45 is likely contaminated by quark - induced contributions@xcite .",
    "in addition , both @xmath43 and @xmath45 are likely be contaminated by significant dps contributions@xcite ; a careful study of their suppression by the small - momentum - imbalance requirement would therefore be needed .",
    "the same proviso holds for quarkonium - pair production@xcite .",
    "in the tmd - factorization approach , the cross section for near back - to - back @xmath46 production is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the total energy squared in the hadronic centre - of - mass frame .",
    "we stress that the @xmath33 dependence of the cross section is completely factored out from the hard - scattering amplitude squared @xmath49 .",
