    "bell inequalities are conditions that must be satisfied by any local , realistic theory @xcite .",
    "the predictions of quantum mechanics , which is not a local , realistic theory , can violate these inequalities .",
    "therefore , experiments that test these inequalities are able to tell us whether we need quantum mechanics to describe the world , or whether something less radical , such as a local realistic theory will do .",
    "experiments to date , have all shown that a local , realistic description is inadequate .",
    "in addition , bell inequalities have found applications in quantum cryptography , where they can be used to detect the presence of eavesdroppers @xcite .",
    "bell inequalities come in many varieties .",
    "they can be characterized by the number of parties making measurements , @xmath0 , the number of measurement settings , @xmath3 , and the number of possible outcomes for each measurement , @xmath4 .",
    "the original versions , the chsh @xcite and ch @xcite inequalities were for the case @xmath5 .",
    "kaszlikowsi , et al .  showed that by increasing the number of outcomes , @xmath3 , one could more strongly violate local realism @xcite .",
    "bell inequalities for the case @xmath1 , @xmath6 , and general @xmath4 were developed by collins , et al .",
    "@xcite , and this was generalized to the case of general @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and general @xmath4 by son , et .",

    "though the subject initially received little attention , the literature on bell inequalities is now extensive , and we can not hope to summarize all of it here . we would like to point out a very nice discussion by nicolas gisin , which summarizes what was known and what was not as of 2007 @xcite .",
    "we would also like to mention approaches to bell inequalities based on nonlocal games @xcite , graph theory @xcite , and logical consistency conditions @xcite .",
    "it is useful to know the largest violation of a given bell inequality that quantum mechanics makes possible , and , in addition , which quantum state will produce this violation .",
    "the original work on this subject was done by b.  cirelson , who showed that while the bound for the correlations in the chsh inequality dictated by local realism is @xmath7 , the bound allowed by quantum mechanics is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "quantum bounds for other bell inequalities have been found .",
    "wehner found bounds for bell inequalities of the chsh type for @xmath1 , @xmath9 , and general @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "pal and vertesi combined numerical methods with analytic upper bounds to find quantum bounds for a large number of bell inequalities with @xmath1 , general @xmath3 , and @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite here we will be considering inequalities belonging to the case @xmath10 with the object of determining their maximum quantum violation .",
    "full correlation bell inequalities of this type were fully characterized by werner and wolf , and , in addition , they were able to show how to derive maximum quantum violations of these inequalities @xcite .",
    "the inequalities we study are not full correlation inequalities , and we will use a different method to find their maximum violation . the class of inequalities we shall study can be considered generalizations of the ch inequality .",
    "the technique we shall apply is that of jordan bases @xcite .",
    "jordan bases are orthonormal bases of two subspaces , one for each subspace , with very nice overlap properties between basis elements corresponding to different spaces .",
    "these bases can be constructed for any two subspaces and their properties allow us to place bounds on the eigenvalues of bell operators , which do not depend on the dimension of the overall hilbert space or of the subspaces .",
    "we begin by deriving the inequalities we wish to consider .",
    "let us do it first for two parties , and then generalize to the case of @xmath0 parties .",
    "suppose that alice can measure one of two observables , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and bob can measure @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "each of these variables has two measurement outcomes , @xmath15 .",
    "alice and bob are presumed to be sufficiently far apart that their measurements are independent , i.e.  bob s choice of measurement will not influence the result of alice s , and vice versa .",
    "a source produces two particles , and sends one to alice and one to bob , and then alice and bob each perform a measurement on their respective particle .",
    "local realism implies that the probabilities describing the measurement results satisfy @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is just the probability that if alice measures @xmath18 she gets @xmath4 , and if bob measures @xmath19 he gets @xmath20 .",
    "we shall prove a more general version of this inequality shortly .",
    "this inequality is just a version of the ch bell inequality .",
    "a three party version , where we add another participant , charlie , with observables @xmath21 and @xmath22 is @xmath23 this can be extended to @xmath0 parties in the obvious way .",
    "now let us prove the @xmath0-party version .",
    "in that case we label the observables as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , so each of the @xmath0 parties has two measurement choices , and each observable can take the values @xmath27 .",
    "the inequality can be expressed as @xmath28 now if our experiment can be described by a local realistic theory , then there is a joint distribution for all of the observables , @xmath29 , and all of the probabilities in the above inequality can be expressed in terms of this joint distribution .",
    "the joint distribution gives the probability of sequences of ones and minus ones of length @xmath30 . in order to show that this inequality is true , all we need to show is that every sequence of length @xmath30 that appears in the probability on the left - hand side also appears in one of the probabilities on the right - hand side .",
    "all of the sequences that appear on the left - hand side have their first @xmath0 elements equal to @xmath31 , so these are the only sequences we need to consider . if the sequence has all of its elements equal to @xmath31 , then it contributes to the first probability on the right - hand side .",
    "now suppose that some of its elements in its second half ( in the second set of @xmath0 elements ) are equal to @xmath32 , and suppose that one of the @xmath32 s corresponds to the observable @xmath33 .",
    "this sequence will contribute to the probability @xmath34 on the right - hand side .",
    "therefore , all sequences that contribute to the probability on the left - hand side do contribute to a probability on the right - hand side , so the inequality is proved .    as was stated in the introduction ,",
    "these inequalities are not full correlation inequalities of the type considered by werner and wolf @xcite .",
    "a full correlation inequality contains only expectation values of products of @xmath0 observables , one from each party , i.e.  @xmath35 , where @xmath36 can be either @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "our @xmath1 inequality , eq .",
    "( [ twoparty ] ) , can be expressed in this form , but those for @xmath39 or more parties can not .",
    "in order to illustrate our approach to finding the maximum quantum violation , we will start with the simplest case of two parties .",
    "this will reproduce known results , but it gives a simple example of how the method based on jordan bases works .",
    "we have four observables , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath40 , which are now operators on the hilbert space @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the hilbert space in which alice s quantum states lie , and @xmath43 is the hilbert space in which bob s states lie . our first problem in finding the maximum violation of eq .",
    "( [ twoparty ] ) , is that we do not know how we should choose the operators corresponding to alice s and bob s observables .",
    "for the moment let us specify them by their spectral projections .",
    "let @xmath44 , @xmath26 , be the projection operator onto the subspace of @xmath42 on which @xmath18 has the eigenvalue @xmath31 , and , similarly , @xmath45 is the projection operator onto the subspace of @xmath43 on which @xmath46 has the eigenvalue @xmath31 .",
    "the projection corresponding to the subspace on which @xmath18 has the eigenvalue @xmath32 is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the identity on @xmath42 , the projection onto the subspace of @xmath43 on which @xmath46 has eigenvalue @xmath32 is @xmath49 . defining the operator @xmath50 the condition in eq .",
    "( [ twoparty ] ) can be rephrased as @xmath51 .",
    "our task is to find the largest positive eigenvalue of @xmath52 , which will be the largest quantum violation of eq .",
    "( [ twoparty ] ) .",
    "now let @xmath53 and @xmath54 be the subspaces of @xmath42 onto which @xmath55 and @xmath56 project , respectively .",
    "these subspaces possess orthonormal bases , jordan bases , with the following property .",
    "let @xmath57 be an orthonormal basis for @xmath53 and @xmath58 be an orthonormal basis for @xmath54 .",
    "note that we do not know the dimension of either @xmath53 or @xmath54 , so we can not specify how many vectors are in each basis .",
    "these bases can be chosen so that @xmath59 where the @xmath60 are known as the jordan angles and lie between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , one can define subspaces @xmath63 and @xmath64 corresponding to the ranges of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , and jordan bases @xmath67 and @xmath68 satisfying @xmath69 where @xmath67 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath63 , and @xmath68 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath64 . note that the projection operators can be expressed as @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "we now want to find the largest positive eigenvalue of @xmath52 .",
    "we first note that any eigenstate with a positive eigenvalue must contain terms for which the first term in @xmath52 is nonzero , as it is the only positive term , that is the only term that can have a positive expectation value .",
    "therefore , the eigenstate must contain terms of the form @xmath72 , so we need to find out what happens if @xmath52 acts on states of this form .",
    "we shall actually be a bit more general and consider the behavior of the operator @xmath52 acting on states of the form @xmath73 , where @xmath71 .",
    "what we find is that only states with the same values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 are coupled , i.e.  @xmath52 acting one one of these states yields a linear combination of states with the same values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in particular ,",
    "if we have that @xmath76 then we have that we can represent @xmath77 as @xmath78 where we have set @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "what this means is that @xmath41 splits up into four - dimensional invariant subspaces under the action of @xmath52 , and if we want to find the eigenvalues of @xmath52 , we can examine each four - dimensional subspace individually .",
    "the characteristic equation of the above matrix is @xmath81 yielding a maximum eigenvalue of @xmath82^{1/2 } -1 \\right\\ } .\\ ] ] we can now maximize @xmath83 with respect to @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the maximum occurs when @xmath86 giving a maximum value for @xmath83 of @xmath87 .",
    "this is the maximum quantum violation of the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ twoparty ] ) .    we can also find observables and a quantum state that attain this violation .",
    "note that in the above calculation all of the subspaces , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , for @xmath90 are one dimensional , and the overlap between the vectors in the @xmath31 and @xmath7 subspaces is @xmath91 .",
    "we can , therefore , choose @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is just the @xmath97 pauli matrix acting on the two - dimensional space @xmath42 , @xmath98 is the @xmath97 matrix acting in the two - dimensional space @xmath43 , and similarly for @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we then have that @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "the state that produces the maximum violation , which is just the eigenstate of the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ two - party - matrix ] ) with @xmath86 , corresponding to @xmath83 , is , in the @xmath104 basis , @xmath105 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this state has interesting properties .",
    "first , it is a maximally entangled state .",
    "next , suppose alice and bob independently decide to measure their part of the state in either the @xmath106 or @xmath107 basis .",
    "they then announce which basis they used .",
    "we want to maximize the chance that , no matter which basis choice they make , that once the basis choices are announced , each party can predict the other s measurement result . for example , suppose both parties decide to measure the state in the @xmath106 basis , and suppose alice got @xmath31 , corresponding to the state @xmath108 for her result .",
    "then with a probability of @xmath109 , bob will also have gotten the result @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , if the both measured in the @xmath107 basis , and alice got @xmath31 corresponding to @xmath110 , then the probability that bob got @xmath32 , corresponding to @xmath111 , is @xmath112 .",
    "for all of the basis choices the correspondences are @xmath113 the first column gives the basis choices , with alice s choice first , and the next two columns give which of alice s and bob s measurement results correspond to each other .",
    "in all cases , if either alice or bob gets the measurement result shown above , then the probability that the other party obtains the corresponding state is @xmath112 . therefore , in this state , alice s and bob s measurement results are highly correlated independent of whether they measure in the @xmath106 or the @xmath107 basis .",
    "it is correlations of this type that allow a quantum strategy of the chsh nonlocal game to be better than any classical strategy @xcite .",
    "now let us look at the three party inequality , eq .",
    "( [ threeparty ] ) . before finding the maximum violation , which will ultimately require some numerical work",
    ", we present some simpler cases of quantum states that violate the inequality .",
    "one possibility is to find a state that makes the probability @xmath114 nonzero and all of the others zero . in order to do this",
    ", we have to specify a quantum mechanical system and the observables .",
    "we shall suppose that the system consists of three qubits , and that the observables labeled by @xmath31 correspond to @xmath115 and those labeled by @xmath7 correspond to @xmath116 .",
    "that is , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , etc .",
    "define the subspace @xmath117 to be the span of the vectors @xmath118 , where in these states , the first slot is the state of qubit @xmath119 , the second the state of qubit @xmath120 , and the third of qubit @xmath121 .",
    "what we want is a vector that is orthogonal to @xmath117 and has a nonzero overlap with the state @xmath122 .",
    "such a state is @xmath123 with this state , the left - hand side of the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ threeparty ] ) becomes @xmath124 , and the right - hand side is zero . as we shall see , this is by no means the largest violation we can obtain .",
    "this state has the following correlation properties .",
    "if all of the parties measure in the @xmath106 basis , or two of them measure in the @xmath107 basis and the remaining party measures in the @xmath106 basis , then the measurement results are uncorrelated .",
    "that is , one party does not gain any information from his measurement about what the results of the other two measurements were .",
    "the situation is different , however , if all of the parties measure in the @xmath107 basis or one measures in the @xmath107 basis and two measure in the @xmath106 basis . in order to see what happens",
    "when everyone measures in the @xmath107 basis , we can express the state as @xmath125 from this expression , we see that if one party gets @xmath126 for his measurement , he can be assured that the remaining parties got opposite results for theirs , that is one got @xmath126 and the other got @xmath127 .",
    "if one party gets @xmath127 , however , then he knows that the remaining parties got the same result for their measurements , either both got @xmath126 , or both got @xmath127 .",
    "now suppose that one party , say the first , measures in the @xmath107 basis while the other two measure in the @xmath106 basis .",
    "it is now convenient to express the state as @xmath128 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this we see the following , if the party measuring in the @xmath107 basis gets @xmath126 , then the other two parties will get the same measurement result , and if he gets @xmath127 , then the other two parties will get opposite results . now ,",
    "if one of the parties measuring in the @xmath106 basis gets @xmath61 , then the other two parties got either @xmath126 and @xmath61 or @xmath127 and @xmath31 , while if the @xmath106 result was @xmath31 , then the other two parties got either @xmath126 and @xmath31 or @xmath127 and @xmath61 .",
    "one can obtain a larger violation of the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ threeparty ] ) with the same quantum system , three qubits , and the same assignment of observables , but choosing a different quantum state . under these assumptions the state that produces",
    "the largest violation is the eigenstate of the operator @xmath129 with the largest eigenvalue . setting the characteristic polynomial of the operator equal to zero",
    ", we find that there are three eigenvalues of zero , two of @xmath130 , and the remaining three eigenvalues are roots of the cubic equation , @xmath131 . solving this",

    "we have the subspaces , @xmath137 , which are the ranges of the corresponding projections @xmath134 each with their jordan bases .",

    "we now consider the action of @xmath144 on vectors of the form @xmath145 , where @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 are fixed .",
    "we find that the subspace spanned by these eight vectors , which we shall call @xmath150 , is mapped into itself by @xmath144 .",
    "in fact , denoting @xmath151 and defining @xmath152 to be the five - dimensional subspace spanned by these vectors , we find that @xmath144 maps @xmath150 into @xmath152 .",
