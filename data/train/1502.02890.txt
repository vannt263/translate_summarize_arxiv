    "the perspective to realize atomtronic devices @xcite as well as the exploration of transport features that are known from electronic mesoscopic systems @xcite have strongly stimulated the research on the dynamical properties of ultracold atoms in open systems . while fermionic atoms provide direct analogies with the electronic case @xcite , the use of a bosonic atomic species brings along new aspects and challenges for the atomic transport problem @xcite , related , in particular , with the link between a mesoscopic bose - einstein condensate in a reservoir and the microscopic dynamics of an ensemble of few interacting atoms within a transistor - like device . a particularly promising configuration for the experimental study of these aspects is provided by the guided atom laser @xcite in which atoms are coherently outcoupled from a trapped bose - einstein condensate into an optical waveguide .",
    "a coherent atomic beam can thereby be created and injected onto engineered optical scattering geometries .",
    "this would allow one to study bosonic many - body scattering at well - defined incident energy .",
    "a theoretical modeling of such waveguide scattering processes within guided atom lasers faces the challenge of dealing with an open system in a many - body context , potentially involving a very large number of atoms in total .",
    "exact diagonalization methods therefore quickly encounter limitations when describing such processes .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii approximation , on the other hand , which has been used in a number of studies on guided atom laser processes @xcite , is granted to work in the mean - field limit of large atom densities and vanishing atom - atom interaction strengths @xcite .",
    "it is , however , known to break down in the presence of significantly strong interaction effects @xcite .    the truncated wigner ( tw ) method @xcite appears to be a reasonable compromise in this context . according to common understanding ,",
    "this method essentially consists in representing the time evolution of a bosonic many - body quantum state by classical fields evolving according to a gross - pitaevskii equation , whose initial values are chosen such that they properly sample the initial quantum state under consideration .",
    "they thereby provide a stochastic sampling of the approximated time evolution of the many - body wigner function defined in the phase space of the bosonic field .",
    "the tw method has been successfully applied in a number of contexts involving dynamical processes of ultracold bosonic atoms .",
    "this includes , most recently , scattering of atom laser beams within one - dimensional bose - hubbard systems @xcite . in this latter transport context",
    ", the tw method was shown to yield quantitative predictions for the average transmitted current that were shown to be in good agreement with complementary matrix - product state calculations in the regime of moderate on - site interaction strenghts @xcite .",
    "while it is possible to formulate the tw method in a functional manner @xcite , its practical implementation is most conveniently achieved by means of a discrete basis of the single - particle hilbert space .",
    "this is straightforward to accomplish for dynamical process that are effectively taking place within spatially confined regions . in that case ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions can , e.g. , be imposed at a sufficiently large distance from the quantum many - body wave packet to be studied , giving thereby rise to an effective discretization in momentum space .",
    "this is , however , not a viable option for studying quasi - stationary scattering processes which are generally characterized by an infinite spatial extension .",
    "we therefore propose to discretize the _ position _ space in order to implement the tw method in this context , as was effectively done in ref .",
    "@xcite a primary purpose of this paper is to introduce this discretization procedure in some detail and discuss its validity in the continuous limit , both from an analytical and from a numerical point of view .",
    "moreover , we present in this paper an unconventional derivation of the tw method in the framework of the semiclassical van vleck - gutzwiller theory @xcite .",
    "this allows us to identify the tw method with the diagonal semiclassical approximation in the bosonic field - theoretical context , and , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , to quantitatively account for interference effects beyond tw .",
    "we note that the tw method can also be derived through other approaches such as wigner - moyal expansions @xcite , quasiclasical corrections to the effective action @xcite , and the so - called semiclassical approximation in the context of the keldysh approach @xcite . in those approaches , however , quantum corrections are perturbatively incorporated on top of a classical background given by the propagation of phase space distributions along classical trajectories that are accounted for in an independent ( i.e. incoherent ) manner .",
    "interference effects involving different trajectories are essentially non - perturbative and require special resummation techniques that are justified only in the presence of small parameters , ( typically the strength of interactions or the size of quantum fluctuations ) .",
    "while the van vleck - gutzwiller theory yields exactly the same ( tw ) approximation to leading ( classical ) order as the other approaches mentioned above , its key asset resides in the fact that it can readily incorporate quantum interference in a non - perturbative manner and describe , e.g. , coherent backscattering in the fock space of many - body systems @xcite .",
    "this is our primary long - term motivation to advertise this approach in this article .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : dis ] we shall discuss in some detail the spatial discretization procedure of one - dimensional waveguide scattering configurations . section [ sec : semi ] is devoted to deriving the tw method in the framework of the van vleck - gutzwiller theory .",
    "we shall then argue in section [ sec : noise ] that the tw approach can be reformulated in terms of a stochastic gross - pitaevskii equation whose noisy components exhibit well - defined statistical characteristics in the continuous limit .",
    "these findings are confirmed by numerical results on transport through a symmetric double barrier potential , as we show in section [ sec : results ] : both the average total current of atoms and its incoherent part tend to finite values in the continuous limit .",
    "we consider a many - body scattering process of a coherent atomic matter - wave beam within a waveguide . this matter - wave beam is supposed to be created by a coherent outcoupling process from a trapped bose - einstein condensate , as is commonly done in guided atom lasers @xcite .",
    "if we assume that only the transverse ground mode of the waveguide is populated , we can describe this system by the many - body hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively represent the creation and annihilation operators of a bosonic particle at the longitudinal position @xmath3 within the waveguide .",
    "@xmath4 is the mass of the atoms , @xmath5 describes a scattering potential ( given , e.g. , by a sequence of barriers ) within the waveguide , and @xmath6 is the spatially dependent one - dimensional interaction strength of the atoms in the waveguide .",
    "it is approximately given by @xmath7 @xcite where @xmath8 is the transverse confinement frequency of the waveguide and @xmath9 is the ( generally very small ) s - wave scattering length of the atomic species under consideration .",
    "both @xmath8 and @xmath9 can depend on the position in the waveguide , the former through a spatial variation of the transverse confinement , and the latter through a spatially dependent feshbach tuning .",
    "the trap is modeled by a single one - particle state with energy @xmath10 whose associated creation an annihilation operators are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "trapped atoms are outcoupled to the waveguide through the spatially dependent ( real ) coupling strength @xmath13 , which , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite would model the effect of a radiofrequency field that flips the spin of the atoms .",
    "we shall in the following assume a macroscopically large initial population @xmath14 of the atoms in the trap in combination with a very small outcoupling strength @xmath15 , such that the trapped condensate is not appreciably affected by the outcoupling process on finite evolution times .",
    "the time evolution of the system can then be effectively described by the equation @xmath16 for the time - dependent field operator @xmath17 describing atoms in the waveguide .    in order to implement the tw method for this many - body scattering problem",
    ", we first need to introduce a discretization procedure of this spatially continuous quantum field equation .",
    "as pointed out above , such a discretization can not be defined in momentum or energy space ( e.g. through the introduction of periodic boundary conditions at @xmath18 for some large @xmath19 ) as this would not be compatible with the formation of a quasi - stationary scattering state .",
    "we therefore propose to discretize the _ position _ space , namely through the introduction of a high - energy cutoff in momentum space at @xmath20 for some effective spatial grid size @xmath21 .",
    "correspondingly , we also modify the hamiltonian of the free kinetic energy close to the high - energy cutoff , such that it reads @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this hamiltonian is still diagonalized in the eigenbasis of the normalized waves @xmath25 satisfying @xmath26 .",
    "their associated eigenvalues now read @xmath27 close to the cutoff while they are still approximately given by @xmath28 for @xmath29 .    in close analogy with the theory of",
    "spatially periodic systems , we now introduce an effective wannier basis through the spatially localized functions @xmath30 for integer @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , which can effectively be seen as fourier series coefficients of the waves @xmath33 .",
    "they therefore satisfy @xmath34 and thereby form an orthogonal basis set that spans the restricted hilbert space obtained after the introduction of the momentum cutoff . defining the corresponding creation and annihilation operators @xmath35 , @xmath36 such that we have @xmath37 , we can now reformulate the free kinetic hamiltonian such that it reads @xmath38 this expression is identical to the one that would be obtained from a finite - difference approximation of the kinetic energy in the waveguide .",
    "altogether , we thereby obtain in the limit @xmath21 the effective bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xmath39 \\label{eq : hl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduce the definitions @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , and where , for the sake of convenience , we redefine in eq .",
    "the zero of the energy scale such that it coincides with the energy of trapped atoms",
    ". the time evolution of the discrete field operator @xmath36 is then given by @xmath43",
    "having accomplished the discretization of the exact quantum description , a semiclassical approach can be used in the regime of large particle numbers @xmath44 , which does not resort to the numerical solution of the operator - valued equations  ( [ eq : eomdis ] ) .",
    "this approach has three levels of approximation .",
    "the first level is the purely classical limit consisting of the propagation of the ( discretized ) gross - pitaevskii equation that is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eomdis ] ) by the substitution @xmath45 and @xmath46 where the latter classical fields are canonically conjugated variables . in a second step",
    ", a finite initial phase - space distribution of the quantum many - body wigner function is accounted for .",
    "this phase - space distribution can contain non - classical correlations which is , however , not the case in our present problem .",
    "finally , a full - fledged semiclassical approximation is obtained by coherently adding amplitudes associated with classical trajectories , in order to address quantum interference effects @xcite .",
    "the second stage in this hierarchy of levels of approximation is the tw method .",
    "here we derive this method in an unconventional manner which is based on a semiclassical approximation of the feynman propagator of our effective bose - hubbard system in terms of a coherent sum over solutions of the mean - field equations .",
    "the notion of the term `` semiclassical '' in our approach is conceptually different from its meaning in the context of the moyal - wigner expansion used in quantum optics @xcite , the quantum corrections to the effective action of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the quasiclassical corrections within the keldysh approach @xcite . in those approaches ,",
    "the classical limit is identified in terms of the transport equations of _ probability _ distributions in phase space ( the so - called _ classical field _ in the keldysh language @xcite ) , while quantum corrections are systematically incorporated as perturbation series around this classical background .",
    "although interference effects , with their charateristic non - perturbative dependence on @xmath47 , can be obtained within those frameworks by special resummation techniques , these techniques are in principle not suitable to tackle classically chaotic situations where all relevant physical forces governing the dynamics of the system under consideration are of the same order and no small parameter can be identified .",
    "the semiclassical van vleck - gutzwiller approach , on the other hand , is particularly powerful precisely in this chaotic regime where it allows one to predict universal interference effects .",
    "its key feature is that it approximates the quantum time evolution of the system by a semiclassical superposition of _ amplitudes _ and therefore explicitly accounts for quantum mechanical interference through coherent double sums over classical paths . by working with amplitudes instead of probabilities",
    ", we can explicitely identify tw with the assumption that pairs of different classical solutions have uncorrelated actions .",
    "going beyond this so - called diagonal approximation and taking into account systematic off - diagonal contributions , the semiclassical approach has been used to predict interference effects beyond both tw and its quasiclassical corrections in good agreeement with numerical simulations @xcite .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we begin with the time evolution of an arbitrary many body state , @xmath48 , governed by the time evolution operator @xmath49 associated with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hl ] ) .",
    "our hilbert space @xmath50 is spanned by the fock states associated with the site basis , where the discretized field operators act in the usual manner , namely by raising or lowering the number of particles in a given site : @xmath51    the starting point of our approach is to use of a different basis for @xmath52 , which is the formal equivalent of the position representation used in the usual derivation of the feynman propagator in first - quantized systems .",
    "this new basis @xmath53 is given by the common eigenstates of the commuting set of hermitian operators @xmath54 which are known in quantum optics as quadratures .",
    "using the defining property @xmath55 , the orthonormality and completness relations @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the quadrature basis follow directly .",
    "having at hand a complete basis with continuous states , a path integral representation of the time evolution operator can be obtained in the usual way .",
    "contrary to the usual kinetic - plus - potential hamiltonian in the first - quantized case , the use of the eigenstates @xmath58 of the momentum quadratures @xmath59 is not only useful but essential to get the amplitude @xmath60 of the propagation from an initial to a final quadrature state @xmath61 { \\rm e}^{i r[{\\bold q}(s),{\\bold p}(s ) ] / \\hbar}\\ ] ] in the form of an integral over paths @xmath62 satisfying the boundary ( shooting ) conditions @xmath63 and @xmath64 . here",

    "we now continue with a stationary phase analysis of the path integral , following gutzwiller s pionering work in the 60 s and 70 s @xcite .",
    "this programme was accomplished in ref .",
    "it yields as final result the propagator @xmath72 as a sum over all solutions of the classical shooting problem ( up to an extra phase @xmath73 involving the maslov index @xmath74 , which is not important in the following ) .",
    "the time evolution of the expectation value @xmath75 of a properly ( weyl ) ordered operator @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 our goal is to obtain a semiclassical approximation for this expression . as first step , we substitute the semiclassical propagator ( [ eq : ksc ] ) in eq .  ( [ eq : expect ] ) . at this level of approximation",
    ", we only assume that a typical action in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) is significantly larger than @xmath47 . in that limit , for any smooth functions",
    "@xmath78 we have @xmath79 using @xmath80 , we obtain then @xmath81 this then yields a double sum over classical trajectories in eq .  .",
    "it is remarkably accurate even for moderate values of the classical actions and for arbitrary large times , and it sucessfully describes interference phenomena through the coherent sum over the oscillatory amplitudes that are associated with each trajectory .    in a further approximation ,",
    "one makes use of the fact that the double sum over paths contains a large number of terms that effectively cancel each other in the presence of an average over initial and final positions as in eq .  .",
    "only pairs of trajectories with similar actions yield nonvanishing contributions due to phase cancellations , which gives rise to incoherent sums of slowly oscillatory terms with non - zero average .",
    "this is the essence of the _ diagonal approximation _ , the standard tool to obtain leading , classical - like , contributions from coherent double sums representing semiclassical amplitudes .",
    "in the present context , the diagonal approximation is implemented by pairing @xmath82 and @xmath83 for which @xmath84 . in the semiclassical limit , all smooth terms in the propagator are then evaluated at @xmath85 , while the actions are expanded up to first order in @xmath86 according to @xmath87 .",

    "in summary , we investigated the feasibility of the tw approach for the description of quasi - stationary scattering processes with interacting bose - einstein condensates in one - dimensional waveguides .",
    "while a discretization of position space is most conveniently introduced in order to apply the method in practice , we showed that consistent results are to be obtained in the continuous limit of vanishing grid spacing .",

    "it certainly breaks down in the presence of very strong interactions where genuinely quantum many - body approaches based on the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) and the matrix - product state ( mps ) method @xcite as well as on the gutzwiller ansatz ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) are more appropriate to describe the dynamics of the system .",
    "we furthermore presented a semiclassical derivation of the tw approach in the framework of the van vleck - gutzwiller theory , which essentially relates this approach to the diagonal semiclassical approximation .",
    "this latter framework opens possibilities for a wider application of the tw method in the context of moderately interacting systems that exhibit chaotic classical dynamics .",
    "indeed , while the conventional implementation of the tw method is not expected to yield reliable predictions for long evolution times that exceed the ehrenfest time of such a chaotic system , _ average _ transport observables , which are obtained , e.g. , in the presence of disorder , are nevertheless expected to be correctly reproduced by this approach provided we can safely assume classical ergodicity ( and account for systematic quantum interference effects such as coherent backscattering in fock space @xcite ) .",
    "this new semiclassical perspective of the tw approach will also form a useful basis for the development of a truly semiclassical van vleck - gutzwiller ( or herman - kluk ) approach that is able to capture interference effects beyond the diagonal approximation @xcite .",
