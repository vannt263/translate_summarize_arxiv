    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols allow two parties , traditionally called alice and bob , to generate a secret key , which enables them to communicate secretly via onetime pad encryption .",
    "there are qkd protocols , that guarantee the security of the key against an eavesdropper , who is capable of implementing arbitrary quantum operations ( coherent attacks ) @xcite .    after the execution of a qkd protocol alice and bob should share an identical and random bit string , which is unknown to a potential eavesdropper eve .",
    "if one forgets for a moment about the secrecy of the bit string , the goal in a qkd protocol is that one of the communicating partners infers a bit value corresponding to a measurement outcome obtained or a state prepared by the other . in an optimal protocol one would request that this is possible in every run of the protocol .",
    "a similar problem has been proposed by vaidman , aharonov and albert in the context of the retrodiction of a measurement result of a spin @xmath0-particle , known as the mean king problem @xcite .",
    "alice in this setting has to guess the outcome of a measurement performed by bob without knowing the measurement bases used .",
    "there has been a first proposal to use this setup in a quantum cryptographic context in @xcite , but a security proof accounting for an arbitrary attack on both quantum channels was not given . in this paper",
    "we show , that there are solutions to the mean king problem , which guarantee the security of these measurement results against an eavesdropper in a stronger scenario , thus establishing the connection between retrodiction and security .",
    "in addition the proposed protocol generates a bit of raw key in every single run .",
    "the retrodiction problem can be stated as a quantum game played by two players .",
    "one player , alice , wins the game if she can guess a measurement outcome obtained by the other player , bob . beforehand",
    "both of them agree on a hilbert space @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 and a set of @xmath3 orthonormal bases of this hilbert space @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 denotes the i - th basis vector of the b - th basis .",
    "alice starts the game by preparing a maximally entangled state @xmath6 and sends the second system to bob .",
    "he performs a projective measurement in a randomly chosen basis @xmath7 , but keeps this choice and his measurement result @xmath8 secret .",
    "after bob has returned the resulting eigenstate of his measurement to alice , she holds the state ( conditional on bob obtaining @xmath8 ) @xmath9 after alice has performed a final measurement @xmath10 on this state , obtaining a classical result @xmath11 , all quantum information is discarded . in the last step bob reveals his choice of basis @xmath12 and depending on this value and her measurement result @xmath11 , alice has to guess bob s measurement outcome @xmath8 .",
    "we note that the precise form of the result @xmath11 is not important and we might think of it as a @xmath3-tupel @xmath13 indicating to alice that she should guess @xmath14 if the basis @xmath12 was chosen by bob .",
    "we refer to @xmath11 as a guessing function .",
    "as there are @xmath2 different possible measurement outcomes for each of the @xmath3 measurement bases , the set @xmath15 of possible guessing functions has @xmath16 different elements . a successful strategy for alice consists of a maximally entangled state @xmath17 and a measurement @xmath10 such that the probability for a wrong guess is zero , which means that @xmath18 , unless @xmath19 and that she can make a guess in every round , implying the normalization condition @xmath20 .",
    "the existence of such a strategy has been studied in the case of mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown , that for constructing a winning strategy weaker conditions are sufficient .",
    "a set of @xmath21 bases only has to be _ non - degenerate _ meaning that the span of the projectors @xmath22 is @xmath23 dimensional and has to _ admit a classical model_. here a set of @xmath21 bases is said to admit a classical model , if there exists a probability distribution of @xmath21 variables , each taking @xmath2 values , such that its marginals equal the probability distributions of the joint probabilities @xmath24 for all pairs of bases .    in our scenario with @xmath25 ,",
    "non - degeneracy implies also that the projectors span the space of all hermitian operators on @xmath1 .",
    "of course , @xmath3 mutual unbiased bases ( mubs ) are an example of a set of bases exhibiting this properties @xcite .",
    "we assume a setting for the mean king problem , in which the set of bases is non - degenerate and alice has a successful strategy , that is maximal in the sense of incorporated measurement projectors ( see bellow ) . in each run",
    ", there will be @xmath26 instances of the mean king problem , and we use a vector arrow to indicate @xmath26-tuples of choices outcomes , etc .",
    "it is irrelevant for our analysis , whether the steps are carried out sequentially for each instance , or for the full block of @xmath26 instances simultaneously .    1 .",
    "initially , an entangled state @xmath27 of @xmath26 pairs is generated and distributed to alice and bob .",
    "this process is vulnerable to attack , but they proceed as if @xmath28 consists of @xmath26 copies of the pure state used for the mean king problem .",
    "2 .   bob chooses at random @xmath26 measurement bases @xmath29 , performs the projective measurement with basis @xmath30 on the @xmath31 particle , obtaining the results @xmath32 , and sends back the corresponding eigenstate .",
    "altogether he returns @xmath33 , without disclosing @xmath34 or @xmath29 .",
    "3 .   alice performs her measurement @xmath35 on each of the returning particles and the corresponding one in her storage , obtaining as a result an @xmath26-tuple @xmath36 of guessing functions .",
    "after alice announces that she finished the last of her measurements bob publishes his choice of bases @xmath29 from which alice infers @xmath37 .",
    "since this is a mean king game between alice and bob , without eve s interaction this will produce an identical string @xmath38 of @xmath2-digits . in order to test for the presence of an eavesdropper , alice and bob will randomly select some particles @xmath21 and check for the agreement @xmath39 in these instances , and accept ,",
    "if they never find a deviation .",
    "the _ transmission error free scenario _ for the security analysis assumes that alice and bob do find agreement with probability 1 , i.e. , that a potential attacker does not risk the introduction of any errors at all , and also that there are no spontaneous transmission errors .",
    "of course , a full analysis would have to allow for errors , so the proof of security in this scenario is only a proof of principle .    in our setting , eve can interact at different stages .",
    "first she may provide the initial state , possibly keeping a system of her own entangled with the distributed pairs .",
    "then she may interact with the states that bob returns to alice in a coherent way and finally making a joint measurement on her system . since we analyse whole blocks simultaneously",
    ", we even allow choices violating time ordering .",
    "_ what we show in the next section is that if eve s actions do not interfere with the perfect key agreement , which alice and bob can test in principle , then her final conclusion will be uncorrelated with the key , i.e. , she will have learned nothing about it . _",
    "a key notion in the mean king problem is the idea of _ safe vectors _",
    "all vectors in the range of a measurement operator @xmath40 must be safe vectors , if alice does not want to risk a wrong guess .",
    "together with a convenient normalization , we call @xmath41 a safe vector for guessing function @xmath11 if @xmath42 with @xmath43 from eq .",
    "( [ phihat ] ) .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that for a non - degenerate choice of bases such a vector exists for every guessing function @xmath11 .",
    "if alice chooses a measurement @xmath10 that incorporates all of the projectors @xmath44 , @xmath45 we will call her strategy maximal .",
    "we will now show , that an operator , that possesses all the @xmath41 as eigenvectors has to be a multiple of the identity .",
    "let @xmath1 be a hilbert space of dimension @xmath2 and @xmath46 a set of @xmath3 non - degenerate onbs and let alice have a maximal successful strategy .",
    "if an operator @xmath47 fulfills @xmath48 for all safe vectors @xmath41 solving ( [ gl_bed_safe_vec ] ) , then @xmath49 is constant and @xmath50 .    at first from @xmath51",
    "we can conclude that @xmath52 holds . since the number of @xmath16 guessing functions is larger than the maximal dimension @xmath53 of @xmath54 and",
    "there is a safe vector @xmath41 for every guessing function @xcite , we can ask for a decomposition of a given safe vector @xmath41 in a set of linearly independent safe vectors @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , such that @xmath58 .",
    "one possibility is to choose the three safe vectors @xmath59 , whose guessing functions fulfill for two bases @xmath60 , @xmath61 the relations @xmath62 then the decomposition is given by @xmath63 , which can be seen by evaluating the defining equation [ gl_bed_safe_vec ] for all cases .",
    "if @xmath64 are eigenvectors of the operator e , it follows from the uniqueness of the decomposition in linearly independent vectors and @xmath65 that @xmath66 belong to the same eigenvalue .",
    "now pick two arbitrary safe vectors @xmath67 with @xmath68 , which by the assumptions belong to the eigenvalues @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath68 there exist @xmath71 bases @xmath30 with @xmath72 .",
    "now choose a sequence of guessing functions @xmath73 with @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 which accounts for @xmath79 .",
    "with the paragraph above it follows , that @xmath80 for all @xmath81 and therefore especially @xmath82 for all guessing functions @xmath11 since @xmath11 and @xmath83 were arbitrary .    using that @xmath84 holds",
    ", we can find for all @xmath85 a set of linearly independent @xmath86 such that @xmath87 with @xmath88 @xmath89 .",
    "this shows that every @xmath85 is an eigenvector of e and we can conclude that @xmath50 .",
    "the key to showing security for blocks of length @xmath26 is to consider these @xmath26 steps as part of a single instance of a mean king retrodiction game in a larger hilbert space with more bases . by tensoring",
    "we get @xmath90 measurement bases @xmath91 on bob s side in @xmath92 dimensions .",
    "the @xmath26 entangled states alice sends to bob can be considered as an entangled state on @xmath93 and apparently a successful strategy is the @xmath26 times execution of her maximal strategy for the single run @xmath10 obtaining the guessing functions @xmath94 .",
    "the resulting vectors of the form @xmath95 we will call _ safe product vectors _ since after rearranging of the tensor factors @xmath96 they satisfy the constraint .    of course the set of product measurement bases is no longer non - degenerate , but because @xmath97 holds , they still span the space of all hermitian operators on @xmath98 and the same is true for the set of all safe product vectors @xmath99 . from the single safe vectors",
    "@xmath41 , the safe product vectors @xmath100 inherit the decomposition property , by applying the property to one of the tensor factors .",
    "so every safe product vector @xmath100 can be decomposed in three linearly independent safe product vectors @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 with @xmath104 . from this point the argumentation for the operator",
    "@xmath105 follows along the same line as in the single execution case : firstly for every two different safe product vectors @xmath100 and @xmath106 we can find a sequence of guessing functions , that via equation ensure the eigenvalues to be equal . secondly ,",
    "since the span of all safe product vectors generates again @xmath54 , which is therefore an eigenspace of the operator @xmath105 to one single eigenvalue , @xmath105 is a multiple of the identity .",
    "we get    [ lem_eigenwert ] let @xmath99 be the set of all safe product vectors for the n - times execution of a retrodiction problem with @xmath3 non - degenerate measurement bases @xmath46 on a hilbert space @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 , for which alice has a maximal successful strategy . if @xmath107 fulfills @xmath108 for all @xmath100 then @xmath109 for all @xmath11 and @xmath50 holds .",
    "we want to analyze the security of the protocol in a transmission - error free scenario for a full coherent attack on both quantum channels .",
    "that means , that eve might eavesdrop on the communication by replacing the transmission line from alice to bob by an arbitrary quantum channel @xmath110 and that her operation @xmath111 on the feedback channel might be connected to the outcome of this transformation via an additional quantum channel .    as a further generalization",
    "we even give the control of the source of the maximally entangled state to eve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_attack ] ) . in this scenario",
    "we proof that if alice and bob observe perfect correlations of their data , or , more precisely , eve chooses an operation , that does not cause any errors , the resulting key is perfectly secure .",
    "lemma [ lem_eigenwert ] shows that the @xmath26-time execution of a retrodiction game can be viewed as a one time execution of retrodiction game on a larger hilbert space .",
    "because of this , we can proof the security of the @xmath26 times execution of the single qudit protocol by proving the security of a protocol where alice and bob use a @xmath92 dimensional maximally entangled state initially and the product bases and measurements defined in lemma [ lem_eigenwert ] .",
    "now suppose eve prepares the state @xmath112 .",
    "using @xmath113 the elements of the generalized pauli - group of a @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space @xcite , we can decompose this state in the maximally entangled basis on the first two tensor factors and write it as @xmath114 where the operators @xmath115 have the property to generate all basis states of the maximally entangled basis if they are applied in turns to the second tensor factor of @xmath116 @xcite . for the purpose of clarity",
    "these @xmath115 and the @xmath117 are absorbed into the @xmath118 . by measuring this state in the product bases @xmath29 and obtaining the result @xmath34 bob projects it onto the state",
    "@xmath119 here we used that @xmath120 holds for an operator @xmath121 and the maximally entangled state @xmath122 .",
    "eve might implement an arbitrary quantum channel @xmath111 acting on her subsystem and the eigenstate of the measurement bob is sending back to alice .",
    "we now analyze the result of this operation : @xmath123=\\\\ & \\sum_{\\beta,\\beta^\\prime , l } ( \\hat{u}_\\beta^t\\otimes v_l){\\ensuremath{\\vert{\\hat\\phi_{\\vec b}(\\vec i)}\\rangle}}{\\ensuremath{\\vert{e_\\beta}\\rangle}}{\\ensuremath{\\langle{\\hat\\phi_{\\vec b}(\\vec i)}\\vert}}{\\ensuremath{\\langle{e_{\\beta^\\prime}}\\vert } } ( \\hat{u}_{\\beta^\\prime}^t\\otimes v_l)^\\star\\otimes{\\ensuremath {     \\vert{e_l}\\mkern1.2mu\\rangle\\langle\\mkern1.2mu{e_l}\\vert } } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to avoid detection , eve has to restrict her attack to such quantum channels that do not disturb the measurement statistics observed by alice and bob . even after eve has interfered with the quantum systems alice should guess the right measurement outcome if no transmission errors are taken into account",
    "this means that the states received by alice still respond to the same safe vectors @xmath100 as before so the condition @xmath124))=\\prod_{l=1}^n \\delta_{x_l(b_l),i_l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] must be respected for all guessing functions @xmath36 , bases @xmath29 and measurement results @xmath34 . expanding the kraus operators @xmath125 in a standard basis @xmath126 inserting this expression in equation and tracing out eve s system we obtain the state controlled by alice before her final measurement : @xmath127 where we defined the operators @xmath128 as @xmath129 using",
    "we find that the probability to measure one of the safe product vectors @xmath100 for a given tuple of measurement results @xmath34 in a certain product bases @xmath29 is given by @xmath130 from the constraint @xmath131 we can conclude , that @xmath132 has to be valid for every @xmath81 , @xmath21 , @xmath29 , @xmath34 and @xmath36 .",
    "the safe product vectors @xmath100 are unique one dimensional projectors and @xmath133 can not have all the @xmath134 as eigenvectors if @xmath135 holds .",
    "this leads to the constraint , that in order to avoid detection , the operators @xmath128 corresponding to eve s attack have to fulfill the eigenvalue equations @xmath136 for all @xmath100 .",
    "with lemma [ lem_eigenwert ] we can conclude , that the operators are of the form @xmath137 independent of the measurement result @xmath36 that alice obtains .",
    "the state under eve s control after the transmissions is given by : @xmath138)\\\\ & = \\sum_{l , k , k^\\prime } \\operatorname{tr}_{ab } ( e_{l , k}{\\ensuremath {     \\vert{\\hat\\phi_{\\vec b}(\\vec i)}\\mkern1.2mu\\rangle\\langle\\mkern1.2mu{\\phi_{\\vec b}(\\vec i)}\\vert } } e_{l , k^\\prime}^\\star \\otimes{\\ensuremath {     \\vert{k}\\mkern1.2mu\\rangle\\langle\\mkern1.2mu{k^\\prime}\\vert}}\\otimes{\\ensuremath {     \\vert{e_l}\\mkern1.2mu\\rangle\\langle\\mkern1.2mu{e_l}\\vert}}\\\\ & = \\sum_{l , k , k^\\prime } \\gamma_{k , l}\\bar\\gamma_{k^\\prime , l } { \\ensuremath {     \\vert{k}\\mkern1.2mu\\rangle\\langle\\mkern1.2mu{k^\\prime}\\vert}}\\otimes{\\ensuremath {     \\vert{e_l}\\mkern1.2mu\\rangle\\langle\\mkern1.2mu{e_l}\\vert}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence @xmath139 is independent of bob s choice of bases @xmath29 , his measurement result @xmath34 and alice guessing function @xmath36 and eve can not infer any information about the exchanged key if she wants to stay undetected .",
