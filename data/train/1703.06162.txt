    "consider the ising model at low temperature on a cube large cube @xmath8 with minus boundary condition on the bottom face of the cube s boundary and plus on the other five faces .",
    "if the inverse temperature @xmath2 is sufficiently large an interface separating pluses and minuses appears at the vicinity of the bottom face .",
    "this interface wants to minimize its surface tension , and thus has an incentive to remain close to the bottom of the cube but by doing so it loses some degrees of freedom as it feels the constraint of the boundary . due to this energy / entropy competition ,",
    "the typical distance of the interface to the bottom face diverges when @xmath9 , a phenomenon known as entropic repulsion ( proved in @xcite ) .",
    "we can take to problem one step further and add some positive external magnetic fields @xmath10 acting only on the layer on the cube which is adjacent to the bottom face .",
    "heuristically , it is quite clear that a very large magnetic fields forces the interface to stick to the bottom face .",
    "it is a more delicate issue , however , to decide whether this occurs for a magnetic field with an arbitrary small intensity , of if we have a non - trivial transition in @xmath10 between a phase where entropic repulsion persists and a localized one .",
    "this question , as well as the qualitative description of such a phase transition , has given raise to a rich literature , and we refer to the recent survey by ioffe and velenik @xcite for a comprehensive bibliography on the subject .    while the analogous problem in dimension @xmath11 can be solved explicitly ( there is a closed expression for the critical value of the magnetic field @xcite and the behavior in the two phases seems to be well understood ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.1.2 ) ) the understanding of the problem in dimension @xmath12 ( and also in higher dimension ) is far from complete ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.1.3 ) .",
    "one reason for being so is that when @xmath13 , the behavior of interfaces between bulk phases ( far from the boundary ) is rigorously understood only at very low temperature . in that regime .",
    "it is known that ising interfaces are rigid , in the sense that they are microscopically flat apart from local perturbations @xcite .",
    "the existence of the wetting transition in this regime was established in @xcite together with an explicit bound for the value of the magnetic field where the wetting transition should occur ( from now on we denote by @xmath7 the critical value of @xmath10 at which this transition occurs ) .",
    "however , the predicted complete low temperature picture goes beyond the existence of a wetting transition : when the magnetic fields varies , the system should undergo a ( countably ) infinite sequence of phase transitions corresponding to changes of the height for the interface .",
    "the corresponding critical points should accumulate towards the left of @xmath14 ( see e.g. @xcite for evidences of this phenomenon ) . making this",
    "rigorous is a very challenging task and for this reason some attention has been brought to a simplified version of the problem called solid - on - solid ( sos ) .",
    "the sos model is obtained by neglecting interaction with microscopic clusters and assuming that the interface is a graph of a function ( see below for a formal definition ) .",
    "while these simplification should not alter the qualitative behavior of the interface , it makes the model much more tractable : rigorous results have been proved concerning the existence of a roughening transition @xcite ( this transition is also conjectured to occur for the three dimensional ising model ) , and a very detailed picture of the entropic repulsion phenomenon at low temperature has been given @xcite .",
    "the problem of wetting for sos has been considered in the literature with a particular focus on the case of dimension @xmath15 ( the case corresponding to the three dimensional ising model ) .",
    "the existence of a transition was proved in proved by chalker @xcite with bounds on @xmath7 valid at all temperature which implies in particular that entropic repulsion persists with the presence of a small magnetic fields .    in @xcite , a perturbational approach based on cluster expansion techniques",
    "provides some evidence for the infinite sequence layering transition .",
    "more precisely , it is proved that for every @xmath16 , at sufficiently low temperature ( which depends on @xmath16 ) , there exists an interval of values of @xmath10 for which the field localizes at height @xmath16 .",
    "uniqueness of the infinite volume gibbs measure as well as analyticity of the free energy in the corresponding regions are also proved . however , as the requirement on the temperature involves @xmath16 , this result does not imply the occurrence of an infinite sequence of phase transition , nor does it allow to identify the critical wetting line @xmath7 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we prove new results that helps describing the wetting transition at low temperature :    * we identify the critical wetting line , proving that @xmath6 it corresponds to the lower bound derived by chalker ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 4a ) ) .",
    "* we prove that close to the critical point , the free energy is asymptotically equivalent to a function which is affine on intervals delimited by a geometric progression which accumulates on the right of @xmath7 .",
    "point ( b ) is very much related to the conjectured existence of sequence of layering transition that should accumulate on the right of @xmath14 ( discussed e.g.  in @xcite ) .",
    "let us briefly explain this connection : our asymptotic for the free energy is obtained by trying to find an optimal strategy to benefit from the pinning without paying too much entropic cost .",
    "the strategies we consider are of the following type : the interface stabilize at an height @xmath16 above the bottom face , and visit the interaction zone mostly with some rare spikes pointing downward .",
    "we obtain a sharp asymptotic by taking the supremum over over all such strategies ( that is over the localization height @xmath16 ) as evidenced by equation .",
    "each affine part in the asymptotic equivalent displayed in corresponds to a given value of @xmath16 , the angular points corresponding thus to a transition between two localization strategies .",
    "we believe , in agreement with existing conjectures in the literature @xcite that these angular point do not appear only on the asymptotic equivalent but also appear on the free energy curve .",
    "thus they should correspond to first order transitions , meaning , discontinuities for the asymptotic contact fraction .",
    "while we are mostly interested in the two dimensional case , the proof presented in the paper can be adapted for arbitrary dimension .",
    "hence , we introduce the problem in the more general framework .",
