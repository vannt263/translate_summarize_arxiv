    "the coriolis coupling in rotating nuclei often leads to significant consequences .",
    "the back - bending phenomenon is a typical example in which a nucleon pair ( cooper pair ) is broken by the coriolis force . in order to understand the effect of coriolis coupling , it is important to measure both the energy spectra and the inter - band electromagnetic transition rates .",
    "theoretically , the cranking model provides a powerful tool to describe numbers of phenomena in rotating nuclei , such as the angular momentum alignment , the pairing phase transition , the superdeformation , etc .",
    "however , the cranking model has a apparent disadvantage of the semiclassical treatment of nuclear rotation , and does not produce an angular momentum eigenstate .",
    "thus , for calculation of the inter - band transition rates , one may need the angular momentum projection which would be a heavy computational burden .",
    "we have developed a new simple method to take account of quantum angular momentum algebra in the cranking approach @xcite .",
    "the method allows us to calculate matrix elements of the intrinsic moments in the unified model and to see , from the microscopic point of view , how the coriolis coupling affects the transition rates .",
    "the formula for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 transitions is recapitulated in section  [ sec : formula ] .",
    "the electromagnetic transitions between vibrational bands and the ground - state band are a good testing ground of the application , since the experimental data are available up to high spin .",
    "this will be discussed in section  [ sec : vib_bands ] .",
    "the decay of high-@xmath0 isomers by the coriolis mixing mechanism would be another interesting example to see the higher - order coriolis coupling effect , which will be discussed in section  [ sec : high - k ] .",
    "we show only the final formula for the transition amplitudes .",
    "@xcite for details .    since we will discuss only even - even nuclei in this paper , we assume that the ground - state band has the @xmath4 and @xmath5 for transitions from the excited bands ( @xmath6 ) to the ground - state band ( @xmath7 ) . within the lowest - order coriolis coupling and the next order corrections , the @xmath8-pole ( @xmath9 ) transition amplitudes are written in a form @xmath10 \\ ,",
    "\\right ) \\ , \\label{gir}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the forbiddenness @xmath11 for the @xmath0-allowed transitions and @xmath12 for the @xmath0-forbidden transitions .",
    "the form of this formula is identical to the generalized intensity relation in the unified model @xcite , in which however there is no systematic method to calculate the intrinsic parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we have shown that there is a correspondence between the @xmath15-expansion in the unified model and the @xmath16-expansion in the cranking model , and have given a general method to calculate these parameters @xcite .",
    "the properties of vibrational motion in rotating nuclei may be investigated by means of a microscopic formalism of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) based on the cranked mean field ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the method mentioned in the previous section is easily implemented to the cranked rpa formalism .",
    "then , one can calculate the inter - band transition amplitudes in a straightforward manner .",
    "the calculation has been performed for quadrupole and octupole vibrations to investigate @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath18 transitions @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ mikhailov ] , we show @xmath3 and @xmath2 transitions for for @xmath17 vibration in @xmath19er and the @xmath4 octupole vibration in @xmath20th . for the @xmath3 amplitudes of the @xmath17 band , the agreement with the experiments is almost perfect .",
    "the @xmath13 parameter for the @xmath2 amplitude is difficult to reproduce ( the absolute value is renormalized in fig .  [ mikhailov ] ) , while the coriolis coupling parameter @xmath14 shows a reasonable agreement .",
    "=      if the nucleus has an axially symmetric shape , the @xmath0 quantum number is supposed to be a good quantum number .",
    "however , one can expect that this symmetry is broken in a strict sense by the shape fluctuations and the coriolis mixing .",
    "the shape fluctuation with respect to the @xmath17-degrees of freedom has been studied by the @xmath17-tunneling model @xcite .",
    "we discuss the coriolis mixing mechanism for the @xmath21 two - quasiparticle ( 2qp ) isomers in hf isotopes .",
    "the configuration of the isomer is assumed to be the lowest @xmath21 2qp state in each nucleus which is actually @xmath225/2\\otimes[404]7/2 $ ] .",
    "the calculation involves the fourth ( fifth ) order of coriolis coupling for @xmath3 ( @xmath1 ) decays , and the hindrance factors are estimated microscopically ( filled symbols in fig .  [ hindrance ] ) .",
    "the isotope dependence is qualitatively well reproduced , however , the calculation predicts the hindrance factors too small .",
    "although the result is sensitive to the details of quasiparticle spectra ( see difference between circles and triangles in the figure ) , the decay rates are overestimated for most cases , especially for the @xmath1 transitions .    in order to investigate the effect of residual correlations , we introduce the spin - spin interaction , @xmath23 , which may be responsible for the gallagher - moszkowski splitting .",
    "the interaction is diagonalized within a space of 2qp states ( @xmath24mev ) , with @xmath25 kev being adopted in this calculation .",
    "the results are shown by open symbols in fig .",
    "[ hindrance ] .",
    "the hindrance factors are increased by 1@xmath262 orders of magnitude for @xmath3 transitions and by 2@xmath263 orders for @xmath1 .",
    "the results still depend on the details of quasiparticle spectra , however , the dependence becomes weaker than the calculation without the residual correlation .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a general method to calculate the intrinsic parameters in the intensity relations by using the microscopic cranking approach .",
    "the applications to the vibrational transitions and to decay of high-@xmath0 isomers are discussed .",
    "the calculated decay property of 2qp high-@xmath0 isomers seems to be improved by the inclusion of the residual correlations .",
