    "autoregressive moving average ( arma ) models have featured prominently in the analysis of time series .",
    "the versions initially stressed in the theoretical literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) are stationary and invertible . following  @xcite , unit root nonstationarity",
    "has frequently been incorporated , while `` overdifferenced '' noninvertible processes have also featured .",
    "stationary arma processes automatically have short memory with `` memory parameter , '' denoted @xmath1 , taking the value zero , implying a huge behavioral gap relative to unit root versions , where @xmath2 .",
    "this has been bridged by `` fractionally - differenced , '' or long memory , models , a  leading class being the fractional autoregressive integrated arma ( farima ) . a  farima @xmath3 process @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the observable series ; @xmath7 is the lag operator ; @xmath8;@xmath9 with @xmath10 for @xmath11 and by convention @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is the indicator function ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are real polynomials of degrees @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which share no common zeros , and all of their zeros are outside the unit circle in the complex plane ; and the @xmath18 are serially uncorrelated and homoscedastic with zero mean .",
    "the reason ( [ a ] ) features the truncated process @xmath19 rather than simply @xmath20 is to simultaneously cover @xmath1 falling in both the stationary region @xmath21 and the nonstationary region ( , where otherwise the process would `` blow up '' ) . in the former case",
    ", the truncation implies that @xmath22 is only `` asymptotically stationary . '' in recent years , fractional modeling has found many applications in the sciences and social sciences ; for example , with respect to environmental and financial data .    early work on asymptotic statistical theory for fractional models assumed @xmath23 [ and replaced @xmath24 by @xmath20 in ( [ a ] ) ] .",
    "assuming @xmath25 , @xcite and @xcite showed consistency and asymptotic normality of whittle estimates ( of @xmath1 and other parameters , such as the coefficients of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , thereby achieving analogous results to those of @xcite for stationary arma processes [ i.e. , ( [ aaaa ] ) with @xmath28 and other short memory models .",
    "more recently , @xcite considered empirical maximum likelihood inference covering this setting .",
    "note that @xcite and @xcite , and much other work , not only excluded @xmath29 but also the short - memory case @xmath30 , as well as negatively dependent processes where @xmath31 . to some degree",
    ", other @xmath1 can be covered , for example , for @xmath32 one can first - difference the data , apply the methods and theory of @xcite and @xcite , and then add 1 to the memory parameter estimate , but this still requires prior knowledge that @xmath1 lies in an interval of length no more than @xmath33 .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite argued that the same desirable properties should hold without so restricting @xmath1 , in case of a conditional - sum - of - squares estimate , and this would be consistent with the classical asymptotic properties established by @xcite for score tests for a unit root and other hypotheses against fractional alternatives , by comparison with the nonstandard behavior of unit root tests against stationary autoregressive alternatives .",
    "however , the proof of asymptotic normality in @xcite appears to assume that the estimate lies in a  small neighborhood of @xmath1 , without first proving consistency ( see also @xcite ) . due to a lack of uniform convergence , consistency of this implicitly - defined estimate",
    "is especially difficult to establish when the set of admissible values of @xmath34 is large . in particular , this is the case when @xmath1 is known only to lie in an interval of length greater than @xmath33 .",
    "in the present paper , we establish consistency and asymptotic normality when the interval is arbitrarily large , including ( simultaneously ) stationary , nonstationary , invertible and noninvertible values of @xmath35 .",
    "thus , prior knowledge of which of these phenomena obtains is unnecessary , and this seems especially practically desirable given , for example , that estimates near the @xmath36 or @xmath2 boundaries frequently occur in practice , while empirical interest in autoregressive models with two unit roots suggests allowance for values in the region of @xmath37 also , and ( following @xcite ) antipersistence and the possibility of overdifferencing imply the possibility that @xmath31 .    we in fact consider a more general model than ( [ a ] ) , ( [ aaaa ] ) , retaining ( [ a ] ) but generalizing ( [ aaaa ] ) to@xmath38 where @xmath18 is a zero - mean unobservable white noise sequence",
    ", @xmath39 is an unknown @xmath40 vector , @xmath41 , where for all @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 is continuous in @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "more detailed conditions will be imposed below .",
    "the role of @xmath48 in ( [ b ] ) , like @xmath26 and @xmath27 in  ( [ aaaa ] ) , is to permit parametric short memory autocorrelation .",
    "we allow for the simplest case farima@xmath49 by taking @xmath39 to be empty . another model covered by  ( [ b ] )",
    "is the exponential - spectrum one of bloomfield ( which in conjunction with fractional differencing leads to a relatively neat covariance matrix formula  @xcite ) .",
    "semiparametric models ( where @xmath20 has nonparametric autocovariance structure ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) afford still greater flexibility than  ( [ b ] ) , but also require larger samples in order for comparable precision to be achieved . in more moderate - sized samples , investment in a parametric model can prove worthwhile , even the simple farima(@xmath50 , @xmath1 , @xmath51 ) employed in the monte carlo simulations reported in the supplementary material  @xcite , while model choice procedures can be employed to choose @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the farima(@xmath52 ) , as illustrated in the empirical examples included in the supplementary material @xcite .",
    "we wish to estimate @xmath53 from observations @xmath54 , @xmath55 . for any admissible @xmath56 , define @xmath57 noting that ( [ a ] ) implies @xmath58 , @xmath59 . for a given",

    "the estimate @xmath72 is sometimes termed `` conditional sum of squares '' ( though `` truncated sum of squares '' might be more suitable ) . it has the anticipated advantage of having the same limit distribution as the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath61 under gaussianity , in which case it is asymptotically efficient ( though here we do not assume gaussianity ) .",
    "it was employed by @xcite in estimation of nonfractional arma models ( when @xmath1 is a given integer ) , by @xcite in stationary farima models , where @xmath73 , and by @xcite in nonstationary farima models , allowing @xmath74 .",
    "the following section sets down detailed regularity conditions , a formal statement of asymptotic properties and the main proof details",
    ". section [ sec3 ] provides asymptotically normal estimates in a multivariate extension of  ( [ a ] ) ,  ( [ b ] ) .",
    "joint modeling of related processes is important both for reasons of parsimony and interpretation , and multivariate fractional processes are currently relatively untreated , even in the stationary case .",
    "further possible extensions are discussed in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "useful lemmas are stated in section [ sec5 ] . due to space restrictions",
    ", the proofs of these lemmas , along with an analysis of finite - sample performance of the procedure and an empirical application , are included in the supplementary material @xcite .",

    "further , by ( ii ) the derivative of  @xmath86 has fourier coefficients @xmath87 as @xmath88 , for all @xmath42 , from page 46 of @xcite , so that , by compactness of @xmath69 and continuity of @xmath89 in @xmath42 for all @xmath90 , @xmath91 also , writing @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 for all  @xmath42 , and ( ii ) , ( iii ) and ( iv ) imply that @xmath94 finally , ( ii ) also implies that@xmath95 assumption a1 is easily satisfied by standard parameterizations of stationary and invertible arma processes ( [ aaaa ] ) in which autoregressive and moving average orders are not both over - specified .",
    "more generally , a1 is similar to conditions employed in asymptotic theory for the estimate @xmath96 and other forms of whittle estimate that restrict to stationarity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and not only is it readily verifiable because @xmath48 is a known parametric function , but in practice @xmath48 satisfying a1 are invariably employed by practitioners .    1 .",

    "assumption a2 avoids requiring independence or identity of distribution of @xmath103 , but rules out conditional heteroskedasticity .",
    "it has become fairly standard in the time series asymptotics literature since @xcite .",
    "let ( [ a ] ) , ( [ b ] ) and hold .",
    "then as @xmath104 @xmath105    we give the proof for the most general case where @xmath106 , but our proof trivially covers the @xmath107 situation , for which some of the steps described below are superfluous .",
    "the proof begins standardly . for @xmath108 , define @xmath109 , @xmath110 . for small enough @xmath111,@xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "the remainder of the proof reflects the fact that @xmath114 , and thus @xmath115 , converges in probability to a well - behaved function when @xmath116 , and diverges when @xmath117 , while the need to establish uniform convergence , especially in a neighborhood of @xmath118 , requires additional special treatment .",
