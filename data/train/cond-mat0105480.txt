    "the physics of magnetic superconductors is interesting due to competition of magnetic order and singlet superconductivity in bulk materials .",
    "the problem of their coexistence was first set up theoretically in the pioneering work by v. l. ginzburg @xcite in 1956 , while the experimental progress in the field begun after the discovery of ternary rare earth ( re ) compounds ( re)rh@xmath6b@xmath6 and ( re)mo@xmath7x@xmath1 ( x = s , se ) @xcite with a regular distribution of localized re magnetic moments .",
    "it turned out that in many of these systems superconductivity ( with the critical temperature @xmath8 ) coexists rather easily with antiferromagnetic ( af ) order ( with the critical nel temperature @xmath9 ) , where usually the situation with @xmath10 is realized @xcite . due to their antagonistic characters",
    "singlet superconductivity and ferromagnetic order can not coexist in bulk samples with realistic physical parameters .",
    "however , under certain conditions the ferromagnetic order is transformed , in the presence of superconductivity , into a spiral or domain - like structure - depending on the type and strength of magnetic anisotropy in the system @xcite . as the result of this competition ,",
    "these two orderings coexist in a limited temperature interval @xmath11 ( the reentrant behavior ) in errh@xmath6b@xmath6 and homo@xmath7s@xmath1 , or even down to @xmath12 in homo@xmath7se@xmath13 where @xmath14  is the critical temperature for the existence of the inhomogeneous magnetic order .",
    "the coexistence region in errh@xmath6b@xmath6 is narrow where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , while for homo@xmath7s@xmath1 it is even narrower with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath17 - see refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite . in most of the new quaternary rare - earth compounds (",
    "re)ni@xmath0b@xmath0c the antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity coexist up to @xmath12 @xcite , while in honi@xmath0b@xmath0c an additional oscillatory magnetic structure is realized in a limited temperature interval .",
    "this oscillatory magnetic structure competes strongly with superconductivity giving rise  to reentrant behavior in this compound @xcite .",
    "recently the pobell 's group in bayreuth @xcite made a remarkable discovery of the coexistence of superconductivity and nuclear magnetic order in auin@xmath0 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this exciting phenomenon was explained in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is argued that superconductivity can coexist either with spiral or domain - like nuclear magnetic ordering only , depending on the strength of magnetic anisotropy in this cubic system .",
    "important contribution to the physics of magnetic superconductors has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where for the first time was proposed the coexistence of weak - ferromagnetism and superconductivity . in such a case",
    "the spontaneous vortex state due to weak - ferromagnetism is also possible .",
    "we point out that in the above cited magnetic superconductors the exchange interaction ( between localized magnetic moments and conduction electrons ) influences superconductivity much stronger than the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the latter is due to the localized magnetic moments which create dipolar magnetic field , thus affecting the orbital motion of superconducting electrons .",
    "recently , a new class of magnetic superconductors based on layered perovskite ruthenocuprate compound rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 comprising cuo@xmath0 bilayers and ruo monolayers has been synthesized @xcite .",
    "this compound belongs also to the class of high-@xmath22 superconductors ( hts ) .",
    "a subsequent study of transport and magnetic properties has revealed that it exhibits some kind of ferromagnetic order at the critical temperature @xmath23 .",
    "the polarized neutron scattering measurements @xcite show that the magnetic structure ( which appears at @xmath9 ) is predominantly antiferromagnetic with a ru magnetic moment @xmath24 along the c - axis at low temperature .",
    "the same measurements put an upper limit @xmath25 to any net ferromagnetic zero - field ru moment . concerning the last point the important results came from magnetization measurements first reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , which show a hysteresis loop and remanent magnetization .",
    "the latter hints to existence of a ferromagnetic component in the system .",
    "recent magnetization measurements on rusr@xmath0eucu@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite give evidence for a small ferromagnetic component , which lies probably parallel to the ruo plane , with the magnetic moment ( per ru ) @xmath26 at @xmath27 consistent with the neutron scattering data @xcite . note that the smaller value of magnetic moment ( @xmath28 ) in this compound tells us that in the gd - compound some admixture of the large gd moment might take place .",
    "this conclusion is also confirmed by the zero - field muon spin rotation ( zf-@xmath29sr ) measurements @xcite which provide important evidence that the magnetic order is homogeneous on a microscopic scale and accounts for most of the sample volume . at lower temperatures the superconductivity sets in at @xmath30 without affecting the af order @xcite , @xcite notably .",
    "this fact means that superconductivity - which is realized predominantly in the cuo@xmath0 planes , and magnetic order - which is present only in the ruo planes , interact rather weakly , i.e. these two orders are separated spatially .",
    "recently , it was reported @xcite that in ru@xmath31sr@xmath0gdcu@xmath32o@xmath33 the highest superconducting critical temperature reaches @xmath34 for @xmath35 , while there is no sign of the weak - ferromagnetic ( wf ) component in the ruo planes .",
    "it seems that rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 has very interesting magnetic properties , which might result in the absence of meissner phase in some samples @xcite , @xcite , while in some others it is realized @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( this problem will be briefly discussed in section iv . )    in this paper we propose a model of layered magnetic superconductor with weak - ferromagnetism , which might be relevant for the rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath36 compound - the swf model .",
    "this model , studied in section ii , assumes the existence of s / f multilayers with small hopping parameter @xmath37 between s ( superconducting ) and f ( ferromagnetic ) planes along the @xmath38-axis , i.e. @xmath39 . as a result the small @xmath37 gives rise to an effective josephson coupling current @xmath40 between superconducting planes .",
    "it turns out that @xmath41 is suppressed by the exchange field - present in the f - plane only , which causes drastic changes of magnetic properties .",
    "the gibbs free - energy @xmath42 of such a magnetic superconductor with both af and wf orderings in external magnetic field @xmath43 is formulated in section iii .",
    "based on it the lower critical field @xmath5 is also studied there . the estimation of theoretical parameters of the swf model from the experimental results in rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 is done in section iv , where the obtained results are discussed too .",
    "as was mentioned above we consider the magnetic superconductor rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 as a prototype for s / f atomic multilayers by assuming good conduction in cuo@xmath0 planes - with the quasiparticle spectrum @xmath44 , and a small hopping parameter @xmath45 between the s- and f - planes ( i.e. , along the @xmath38-axis ) .",
    "the second assumption is related to the existence of wf order ( with the magnetization @xmath46 lying in the ruo planes ) which gives rise to an effective exchange field parameter @xmath47 .",
    "the latter affects spins of conduction electrons with the dispersion @xmath48 moving in the normal conducting ruo planes .",
    "( the @xmath49-plane is sometimes labeled by the @xmath50-plane . )",
    "the parameter @xmath4 can be related to an effective spontaneous spin @xmath51 ( magnetization normalized to saturation magnetization ) in the @xmath49-plane , i.e. @xmath52 - see also section iv .",
    "the electronic part of the swf model is similar to the model in the ref .",
    "@xcite and in what follows the same notation is used . according to this model",
    "the elementary cell of the superlattice consists of one superconducting and one ferromagnetic layer which are both metallic .",
    "for simplicity it is supposed here that both layers have similar quasiparticle energy spectra , i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "it is also assumed , that the superconductivity is realized in s - planes ( cuo@xmath0 planes ) with pairing coupling @xmath54 ( having in mind application to the hts compound rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 the clean limit , @xmath55 , is supposed ) .",
