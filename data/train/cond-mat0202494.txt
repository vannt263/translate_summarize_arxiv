    "ac electrokinetic pheonomena , such as dielectrophoresis and electrorotation ( er ) have been investigated to yield the selective manipulation and characterization of biological cells . under the action of external fields , colloidal particles or biological cells in suspensions",
    "exhibit rich fluid - dynamic behavior as well as dielectric response .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate their frequency - dependent responses to ac fields , which leads to valuable information on the structural ( maxwell - wagner ) polarization effects @xcite .",
    "the polarization is characterized by a variety of characteristic frequency - dependent changes known as dielectric dispersion .    in the last two decades",
    ", various experimental tools have been developed to analyze the polarization of biological cells - dielectric spectroscopy @xcite , dielectrophoresis @xcite and er @xcite techniques . among these techniques ,",
    "conventional dielectrophoresis and er are usually applied to analyze the frequency dependence of translations and rotations of cells in a rotating electric field , respectively @xcite . moreover , one is able to monitor the cell movements with the aid of automated video analysis @xcite as well as light scattering methods @xcite . in er , a dipole moment",
    "is induced in response to the rotating field .",
    "then any dispersion process is able to cause a phase shift between the induced dipole moment and the external field vector , resulting in a desired torque which causes the cells to rotate .    in the dilute limit ,",
    "the er of individual cell can be predicted by ignoring the mutual interaction between cells .",
    "however , the cells may be aggregated under the influence of the external field . in this case the brownian motion can be neglected , and thus the system becomes non - dilute even though it is initially dilute .",
    "then the role of mutual interaction will become dominant . as an initial model , we studied the er of two approaching spherical particles in the presence of a rotating electric field in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "we showed that when the two particles approach and finally touch , the mutual polarization interaction between the particles leads to a change in the dipole moment of individual particles and hence the er spectrum , as compared to that of isolated particles .",
    "the mutual polarization effects were captured via the multiple image method @xcite . from the results , we found that the mutual polarization effects can lower the characteristic frequency at which the maximum er angular velocity occurs .    when the volume fraction of the suspension becomes large",
    ", the mutual interactions between the suspended particles can also modify the spin friction , which is a key to determine the angular velocity of er . for er of two particles in a rotating electric field",
    ", we have successfully applied the spectral representation to calculate the dispersion frequency .",
    "however , the determination of the spin friction was lacking .    for two particles ,",
    "the basic tool is the reflection method @xcite , being analogous to the multiple image method in electrostatics , but being valid for two particles only . for more than two particles ,",
    "we need a first - principles method , e.g. , the green s function ( oseen tensor ) formulation . for a dilute suspension , however , one may adopt the effective medium theories @xcite to capture the effective viscosity of a suspension . thus , in this case , the er spectrum can be modified further .    regarding the spectral representation approach @xcite",
    ", it is a rigorous mathematical formalism of the effective dielectric constant of a two - phase composite material .",
    "it offers the advantage of the separation of material parameters ( namely the dielectric constant and conductivity ) from the particle structure information , thus simplifying the study . in the present work",
    ", we will derive the analytic expressions for the characteristic frequencies by using the spectral representation approach .",
    "we consider homogeneous , spherical particles exposed to a rotating electric field of frequency @xmath0 , in which particles of complex dielectric constant @xmath1 are dispersed in a suspension of @xmath2 , with @xmath3 . here ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the dielectric constant and conductivity , respectively .    for the effective dielectric constant @xmath6 of the whole system",
    ", we have : = p _ 1 - _ 2 _ 1 + 2 _ 2 , [ mga ] where @xmath7 is the volume fraction of partices .",
    "note that the @xmath8 limit throughout the paper is just the isolated spherical result @xcite . in this case , the dipole factor of the particle is given by b = _ 1 - _ e _ 1 + 2 _ e. [ b ] in order to obtain the analytic expression for the characteristic frequency , we resort to the spectral representation approach . by introducing a material parameter @xmath9 eq.([b ] ) admits the form :    b=+ , [ repb ] where @xmath10    after some simple manipulations , eq.([repb ] ) becomes @xcite b=+ + + , [ repb2 ] where the dispersion magnitudes @xmath11 and characteristic frequencies @xmath12 being given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the dielectric and conductivity contrasts , respectively .",
    "note that we predict two characteristic frequencies @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    regarding the dynamic viscosity , the noninteracting spin friction expression for an isolated spherical particle must be modified . for many particles interacting in a suspension",
    ", we must consider the suspension hydrodynamics .",
    "the spin friction is calculated by considering the hydrodynamics of a rotating particle in a homogeneous suspension with an effective viscosity @xmath18 . the effective viscosity for a suspension may be obtained from an analogous maxwell - garnett approximation ( mga ) @xcite : = p _ 1 - _ 2 _ 1 + 32 _ 2 , [ eta1 ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively the viscocity of particle and host , and we may take @xmath21 for hard spheres . the dilute limit expression for the effective viscocity is : _",
    "e=_2+(52p)_2 + ( 52p^2)_2 + .",
    "[ mgad ] this equation is a suitable method to determine the effective viscosity at low concentration as it predicts no percolation threshold .",
    "the effective medium approximation ( ema ) is also a useful method to evaluate the effective viscosity of a suspension , which admits the form @xcite :    p + ( 1-p)=0 .",
    "[ eta2 ] we should remark that a percolation threshold @xmath22 is predicted by eq.([eta2 ] ) . from this equation ,",
    "the dilute limit expression is _",
    "e=_2+(52p)_2 + ( 52p)^2_2 + .",
    "[ emad ] to one s interest , eq.([mgad ] ) and eq.([emad ] ) attain the same expansion up to first order in @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , we should also remark that both eq.([eta1 ] ) and eq.([eta2 ] ) are valid only at low reynolds number .",
    "it is known that the rotational angular velocity of a particle is related to the dipole factor as follows ( f)=- im[b ] where @xmath23 is the strength of the applied electric field , and @xmath24 $ ] means taking the imaginary part of @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "during the numerical calculation , set @xmath26 , @xmath27 . note",
    "@xmath28 denotes the dielectric constant of free space .",
    "fig.1(a ) is plotted versus frequency @xmath0 for three different @xmath29 at @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "given @xmath29 , there is always one peak for angular velocity as frequency increases .",
    "the frequency located by the peak is just the characteristic frequency .",
    "we should remark here that two peaks we predict above are located so close that only one peak behavior is shown . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "a pair of particles is investigated by considering the mutual depolarization effect , and we found that one peak is dominant while the other has a lower value and is located in a quite different position .",
    "this shows that the particle aggregation effect may enhance the second peak value , and be relocated close to the dominant one . regarding the related quantitative explanation ,",
    "please refer to fig.3 arising from the spectral representation approach .",
    "as @xmath34 increases , both the characteristic frequency and the angular - velocity peak value decreases .",
    "fig.1(b ) is plotted versus frequency @xmath0 for three different @xmath35 at @xmath30 , @xmath32 , @xmath36 and @xmath33 .",
    "it is evident that increasing @xmath37 yields decreasing characteristic frequency , but increasing angular - velocity peak value .",
    "fig.1(c ) is plotted versus frequency @xmath0 for three different @xmath38 at @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath36 .",
    "it is evident that both the characteristic frequency and the angular - velocity peak value increase for increasing @xmath38 .",
    "fig.1(d ) is plotted versus frequency @xmath0 for three different @xmath39 at @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath36 and @xmath33 . for an increasing @xmath39 , the characteristic frequency increases whereas the angular - velocity peak value decreases concomitantly .    in fig.2 ,",
    "the effect of volume fraction on the effective viscosity is investigated .",
    "clearly , at a larger volume fraction , a larger effective viscosity is predicted both for mga as well as ema .",
    "it is evident that , for a given @xmath7 , ema predicts a larger effective viscosity than mga .    in fig.3",
    ", we investigate the dependence of the spectral parameters , namely the residues ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , the poles ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , as well as the dispersion parameters ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) on the volume fraction @xmath7 ( for mga only ) .    in fig.3(a ) and 3(b ) , as the volume fraction @xmath7 increases , both @xmath40 and @xmath41 increase .",
    "increasing volume fraction @xmath7 leads to decreasing @xmath42 , but increasing @xmath43 .",
    "note that the residues satisfy the relation @xmath46 .",
    "in the two figures , the distinction between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , or @xmath42 and @xmath43 is quite small at low volume fraction ( e.g. , @xmath32 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ) .    in fig.3(c ) , as the volume fraction increases , @xmath44 first increases , and then decreases , while @xmath49 decreases monotonically .",
    "note @xmath50 becomes very close to @xmath44 at low concentration region .    in fig.3(d ) , as the volume fraction increases , @xmath16 decreases , while @xmath17 increases concomitantly .",
    "moreover , it is evident that both characteristic frequencies collapse at low concentration region .    from fig.3",
    ", it is readily concluded that at low volume fraction , the angular - velocity peaks related to two characteristic frequencies are so close that they can almost be seen as overlapped .",
    "this is just the reason why only one rotation peak occurs in our figures .",
    "we believe that such distinction between the two peaks will become recognizable for a high - concentration case .",
    "fig.4 is plotted for three different volume fraction @xmath7 at @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath36 and @xmath33 . in this figure",
    ", we investigate the effect of particle volume fraction on the angular velocity . increasing",
    "volume fraction is able to reduce the characteristic frequency as well as the angular - velocity peak value .",
    "here a few comments on our results are in order .",
    "we considered homogeneous , spherical particles exposed to a rotating electric field .",
    "as the strength of the rotating electric field increases , the particles in a suspension may be aggregated into sheet - like structures . within these structures ,",
    "the concentration of particles is high . in this case",
    ", the local - field effect arising from the many - particle system must be taken into account . in this regard",
    ", we believe the effective medium theories including both the maxwell - garnett approximation ( also known as the clausis - mossotti approximation ) and the effective medium approximation ( also known as the bruggeman approximation ) are good candidate theories . the maxwell - garnett approximation is well - known to be non - symmetrical and may thus be suitable for low concentration . for a higher concentration of particles , we had better use the effective medium approximation ( ema ) .",
    "both methods are valid at low concentrations whereas ema predicts a percolation threshold @xcite .",
    "we believe our theory will be valid for the case of low reynolds numbers . in our present study , both the radii and the angular velocities of the particles are small .",
    "thus , we may safely use the effective medium theories for the viscosity , which are valid when the particles are at rest .",
    "we realize the appearance of a circular medium flow because all the particles rotate in the same direction .",
    "the macroscopic spin rate may drive the suspending liquid , leading to a decrease of the apparent viscosity of the suspension @xcite .",
    "finally , we can apply our formalism to single or multi shell objects , like biological cells @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the electrorotation spectrum of many interacting particles including their electric and hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "the results showed that the electrorotation spectrum can be modified due to the local field effects arising from the many - particle system .",
    "the hydrodynamic interactions between the suspended particles can also modify the spin friction , which is a key to determine the angular velocity of electrorotation . by invoking the spectral representation approach ,",
    "we derived the analytic expressions for the characteristic frequency at which the maximum angular velocity of electrorotation occurs . we reported a detailed investigation of the dependence of the characteristic frequency and the dispersion strength on various material parameters .",
