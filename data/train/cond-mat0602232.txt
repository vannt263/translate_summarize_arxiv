    "thermally activated escape over a potential barrier is ubiquitous in physics , chemistry and biology ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "this phenomenon is important for both quantum @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and classical @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite systems .",
    "it can proceed in strong friction ( overdamped ) , weak friction ( underdamped ) and needless to say intermediate regimes ( see refs . above ) .",
    "the case of thermally activated escape unperturbed by additional external influences pioneered by kramers is exhaustively investigated and by now is a well understood phenomenon .",
    "however in most physical realizations the thermally activated escape is modulated by some external driving . in this case",
    "the stationary limit that may be a rather good approximation in the absence of external driving is already inapplicable . in the presence of the latter",
    "the system becomes intrinsically non - equilibrium and the problem in known to be notoriously difficult for analytical treatment @xcite .",
    "the particular case of periodically driven escape @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is relevant among others for chemical physics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( where a chemical reaction can be influenced by , e.g. , laser electric field ) and enzymology @xcite ( where an enzymatic reaction can be influenced by an oscillating electric field produced by the dynamics of protein structure @xcite ) . according to @xcite the periodic driving force `` ' '",
    "heats up `` the system by changing its effective temperature thus giving rise to lowering of the activation energy of escape which can be much bigger than the real temperature even for comparatively weak fields '' .",
    "revealing the physical aspects of enzyme action may well become one of the most important grounds for application of the periodically modulated thermally activated escape theory . in support of this point of view",
    "it is worthy to note that understanding the role of driving at activated escape in biological systems is considered by the authors of @xcite as `` a fundamentally important and most challenging open scientific problem '' .",
    "the reasons for the above statement are as follows .",
    "the problem of enzyme catalysis is the main unsolved interdisciplinary enigma of molecular biophysics , biochemistry and needless to say enzymology . up to now",
    "there is no definite and commonly accepted understanding of `` how does an enzyme work ? ''",
    "( see , e.g. , heat controversy at a recent conference in the subject issue of phil .",
    "b ( 2006 ) 361 ) .",
    "the idea that dynamical effects may play a crucial role at enzyme action is very popular at present and the concept of the so - called rate promoting vibration is a central one in modern enzymology .",
    "however the practitioners engaged in chemical enzymology traditionally discuss the phenomenon of enzyme catalysis in terms and notions of the transition state theory ( as can be seen from the materials of the above mentioned conference ) .",
    "the latter is essentially equilibrium one that is embedded into its cornestone postulate and is poorly suited for taking into account dynamical effects in a reaction rate .",
    "the main tool to study such effects is the kramers theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "regretfully at present this theory is much less known and necessitated for applications in enzymology than its transition state theory counterpart .",
    "the thermally activated escape problem at periodic driving in the overdamped classical regime was conceptually solved in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "two mutually complementary theories @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite provide deep insights on the behavior of many physical values of interest .",
    "they are based on a physical idea of the optimal path and are able to provide an imaginable picture of the process .",
    "the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite provide description of the escape rate enhancement at weak modulation ( the so - called log - linear regime ) where the change of the activation energy is linear in the modulation amplitude .",
    "most important of all , the escape rate enhancement exhibits the replacement of the log - linear regime by more moderate growth with the increase of modulation amplitude to noise intensity ratio .",
    "such behavior for the intermediate regime of moderately strong and moderately fast driving is well described by the @xcite , @xcite theory that is corroborated by high - precision numerical results .",
    "the scaling bahavior of the prefactor near the bifurcation point is investigated in details @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular the so called adiabatic regime is most thorougly investigated @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this regime is defined by the authors of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as the limit of slow modulation @xmath2 where `` the driving frequency is small compared to the relaxation rate in the absence of fluctuations and the system remains in quasi - equilibrium '' and by the authors of the @xcite , @xcite , @xcite theory as the one that `` goes up to driving frequencies of the order of the inverse instanton time which is related to the curvatures of the potential '' . in the adiabatic regime the scaling behavior of the prefactor for the cubic potential",
    "is given by a simple analytical formula @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however the existing literature leaves room for parallel activity for the following reasons . to attract attention of chemists and biochemists to the modulated thermally activated escape theory within the kramers approach it is necessary to present its final results in as simple and understandable form as is done , e.g. , in the transition state theory . on the contrary the results of both @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite theories are presented via involved notions and values characterizing the optimal action corresponding to the minimizing path .",
    "correct making use of these results requires profound comprehension of their physical content and mastering in depth the methods involved in their deriving . as a matter of fact people engaged in applications ( whom the author of the present manuscript belongs to ) as a rule",
    "are concerned with much more modest objective : how at a given combination from the parameter space ( noise intensity @xmath3 , modulation amplitude @xmath4 , modulation frequency @xmath5 and characteristics of the static potential @xmath6 ) to evaluate the escape rate enhancement in the presence of driving at least for a simple analytically smooth ( i.e. , not piecewise ) metastable or bistable potential ?",
    "that is why it is desirable to have the period - average escape rate in a closed analytical form and explicitly expressed only via the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and characteristics of the static potential @xmath6 including no other physical values . in other words a theory convinient for",
    "applications should restrict the physical content of the resulting formula only by the notions used at initial setting the problem . besides both @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite theories invoke to rather sophisticated methods such as , e.g. , path integrals technique .",
    "the initial mathematical formulation of the problem is a partial differential equation and it seems interesting to see what results can be obtained among others by means of usual mathematics .",
    "these reasons motivate the appearance of the present manuscript .",
    "our aim is to derive by means of elementary methods a closed analytical form of the formula for the escape rate enhancement in the low frequency limit for arbitrary values of the modulation ampitude to noise intensity ratio @xmath1 except a narrow region near the bifurcation point .",
    "our approach is not based on a physical idea a priory inserted into the theory but rather is a direct purely mathematical treatment of the problem .",
    "we define the low frequency limit as the one where there is no essential dependence on frequency so that the formal limit @xmath0 in the appropriate equations can be taken . at the same time we observe the requirement @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the stationary kramers rate ) that is necessary for the efficient averaging over the period to be possible .",
    "the latter means that all interesting phenomena related to the so called stochastic resonance ( taking place at @xmath9 ) are beyond the scope of the present theory .",
    "as the value @xmath10 $ ] is usually vanishingly small there certainly should be a range ( perhaps @xmath11 ) where the contradictory requirements @xmath7 and @xmath0 can be reconciled . as this range turns out to be more restricted than that of slow modulation @xmath2 we use the term low frequency limit instead of adiabatic regime to avoid confusion .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "the problem is formulated and its solution is argued to be sought by perturbation technique for the action in powers of the modulation amplitude .",
    "sec.3 and sec.4 are devoted to the first and second order contributions into action respectively . in sec.5 the results are combined in a closed form for the escape rate enhancement in the low frequency limit . in sec.6",
    "the formula is used to obtain plots . in sec . 7 a simple analytical formula for the limiting case of moderately strong modulation @xmath12",
    "is obtained . in sec.8",
    "the results are discussed and the conclusions are summarized . in the appendix",
    "some technical details are presented .",
    "in this preliminary sec . we pose the problem and remind some facts on the kramers theory to introduce designations and notions used further . in the kramers model a chemical reaction is considered as the escape of a brownian particle from the well of a potential @xmath6 along the reaction coordinate @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the point of the bottom of the well and @xmath15 being the point of its top .",
    "the problem of interest is to take into account the presence of periodic driving with modulation amplitude @xmath4 and frequency @xmath5 . for the driving we adopt without any serious loss of generality the commonly used form @xmath16 the results obtained for this simplest case can be directly generalized to any arbitrary periodic driving because the latter can be expanded into a fourier series . in the overdamped limit ( strong friction case ) the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for the probability distribution function @xmath17 is @xmath18p'(x , t)+dp^{\\prime\\prime}(x , t)\\ ] ] where the dot denotes a derivative in time",

    "its merit is that it has closed and quite simple analytical form to be used by practitioners in chemistry and biochemistry for quick by hand estimates .",
    "the exponent in this formula explicitly and vividly demonstrates how the linear term @xmath238 dominating at weak modulation ( comparatively small @xmath1 ) and responsible for the log - linear regime is replaced by that substracted by the term @xmath239 at further increase of @xmath1 providing the reardation of the exponential growth of the escape rate enhancement .",
