    "recently , the h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite collaborations at hera announced an anomaly at high-@xmath0 in the @xmath5 neutral current ( nc ) channel . using a combined accumulated luminosity of @xmath6 in @xmath5 mode at @xmath7 , the two experiments have observed 24 events with @xmath8 against a standard model ( sm ) expectation of @xmath9 , and 6 events with @xmath10 against an expectation of only @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the high-@xmath0 events are clustered at bjorken-@xmath2 values near 0.4 to 0.5 .",
    "a number of authors have presented proposals for new physics which might explain the nc anomaly , including : new contact interactions  @xcite , @xmath12-channel leptoquark production  @xcite , and r - parity violating supersymmetry  @xcite , and related proposals  @xcite .",
    "there exist a variety of criticisms for each of the proposed ideas , from their highly speculative nature , to very concrete flavor problems which they all share  @xcite .",
    "as such , another somewhat less speculative idea has been proposed  @xcite  in which the anomaly in the hera data is simply further evidence of our inability to calculate , and often even reliably fit , the parton probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) resulting from the non - perturbative dynamics inside the proton .",
    "that is , kuhlmann ,  @xcite , have suggested a way by which the behavior of the pdfs at large-@xmath2 can be modified to explain part , or all , of the hera nc data without disrupting the fits of the old low-@xmath0 , low - to - moderate-@xmath2 data .",
    "it is actually a simple exercise to show that increasing the parton densities at @xmath13 and @xmath14 to 0.5 can in fact fit the nc data .",
    "it is a far more complicated question whether these changes are consistent with all other world data .",
    "we will not consider here the validity of the claim that such a fit can be done which is consistent with the low-@xmath0 data .",
    "instead we will show that there can be dramatic consequences for the hera data itself in the charged current mode at high-@xmath0 .",
    "we will find that the hera data already rules out a number of theoretically acceptable scenarios for modifying the pdfs to agree with the nc data .",
    "hera is capable of running in two modes : @xmath3 and @xmath1 . in the former mode h1 and zeus",
    "have accumulated @xmath15 of data but have observed no statistically significant deviations from the sm .",
    "further , the experiments differentiate between final state @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where the neutrino is identified through its missing @xmath18 .",
    "h1 has also announced its findings in the @xmath19 charged current ( cc ) channel .",
    "they find 3 events at @xmath20 with an expectation of @xmath21 , but no events with @xmath10 .",
    "zeus has not announced its cc data as of this date .",
    "although compared to the nc data , the present cc data is much sparser , one can still conclude from it that there can be no deviations from the sm by more than a factor of 2 or 3 in that channel .",
    "whether there is in fact any deviation at all is still too uncertain to say .",
    "( explanations of the possible cc excess involving non - sm physics have been considered by  @xcite . ) however , given the sizes of the effects which we are going to find , more data in @xmath1 , and especially @xmath3 , mode will provide very strong constraints on the viability of this suggestion .",
    "the class of proposals considered by kuhlmann ,  @xcite , for explaining the hera anomaly can be thought of as variations on the so - called `` intrinsic charm '' scenario@xcite in which it is posited that there is some non - perturbative , valence contribution to the charm quark distributions at @xmath22 .",
    "( current fits assume that there is no valence charm component in the proton and generate non - zero contributions at higher @xmath0 only through perturbative renormalization group flow , , gluon splitting . in this scenario",
    "one can think of the valence structure of the proton being @xmath23 versus the usual @xmath24 . )    though the underlying dynamics ( and motivation ) may be subtle , the proposal itself is straightforward : increase by hand the parton densities inside the proton at @xmath25 and large @xmath0 to the point that the nc cross - section of the standard model matches that observed at hera .",
    "such an effect can arise naturally from non - perturbative dynamics at low @xmath0 if the dynamics produce a narrow `` bump '' in the pdfs at low @xmath0 and very large @xmath26 .",
    "this bump would migrate down to lower @xmath2 as one flows ( through the renormalization group ) up to higher @xmath0 .",
    "such a structure is difficult to rule out ; the data at low @xmath0 and very high @xmath2 is limited and extractions of the structure functions are problematic due to non - perturbative and higher - twist effects which can be important at large @xmath2",
    ". fits available now typically use only data with @xmath27 .",
    "the proposal in @xcite  emphasized enhancements to the @xmath28-quark density rather than that of the @xmath29-quark , but the difference is irrelevant from the point of view of this paper because electroweak physics does not distinguish among the generations .",
    "enhancement of any or all of the parton densities could in principle explain the hera data .",
    "this proposal has strong advantages _ and _ disadvantages . in its favor",
    ", it requires no new physics beyond the standard model and thus automatically solves the flavor problem associated with many of the new physics interpretations  @xcite . to its detriment , it invokes non - perturbative qcd effects which are not calculable and can not be predicted _ ab initio _ , and its consistency with the moderate @xmath0 data taken at both hera and the tevatron has not been fully studied .",
    "putting aside any questions of how well such a proposal can really do at explaining the hera nc data while remaining consistent with all other world data , one can ask : what are the consequences of such a suggestion for the nc process in @xmath30 mode , and for cc processes in either mode ?    the nc result is simple : in this scenario , the nc cross - sections in both @xmath3 and @xmath1 modes scale by approximately the same amount .",
    "the @xmath31 couplings introduce a small helicity dependence that keeps the two modes from being exactly the same .",
    "however , the differences between the two are less than 10% because the photon contribution typically dominates the total cross - section .",
    "thus this proposal predicts that once hera has accumulated enough data in @xmath3 mode , they will observe a nc anomaly there as well , and it should be roughly the same size as that observed in @xmath1 .    in discussing the cc predictions ,",
    "a number of complications arise , most stemming from the fact that the @xmath2 and @xmath0 dependences of the nc and cc cross - sections are somewhat different .",
    "nonetheless , we will present fairly precise heuristic arguments about the sizes of cc effects , which we will then check in a full numerical calculation .",
    "one key simplification is this : in the sm , even at high-@xmath0 , the nc scattering is largely dominated by virtual photon exchange in the @xmath32-channel .",
    "this need not have been so , since at @xmath33 there is no additional kinematic suppression of the @xmath31 contributions ; however , the @xmath31 coupling to quarks is generally smaller than that of the photon . for the arguments that follow",
    ", we will ignore the @xmath31 contributions and reintroduce them only when going to the full calculation in the next section .    for photon exchange alone ,",
    "the nc cross - section at high-@xmath0 behaves as : u(x)+|u(x ) + \\{d(x)+|d(x)}+where @xmath34 is the @xmath28-quark parton probability distribution function ( pdf ) inside a proton , @xmath35 is the @xmath28-antiquark pdf , _ etc .",
    "_ , and the ellipses represent heavier ( @xmath12 , @xmath29 , @xmath36 , @xmath32 ) quarks . the factor of @xmath37 is the relative charge - squared of @xmath28- and @xmath38-type quarks",
    ".    there are four orthogonal classes of changes to the pdf s that can be considered , each corresponding to enhancing the densities of either @xmath28 , @xmath39 , @xmath38 or @xmath40 individually . that we do not have to consider changes to the charm and strange densities is clear , since the physics in question can not distinguish @xmath28 from @xmath29 , or @xmath38 from @xmath12 .",
    "( this is not a general statement for all experiments at all @xmath0 .",
    "for example , it does not hold even at hera if h1 and/or zeus could tag prompt charm production . )",
    "each of these four cases leads to a distinctive cc signature .",
    "we will parameterize the effect of an `` intrinsic quark '' component on the pdfs by : q(x)=q_0(x)+q_int(x)q_0(x)_q(x ) where @xmath41 is the total parton distribution , @xmath42 is the usual fit distribution ( we will use the cteq3 set whenever we have to make an explicit choice  @xcite , similar results would follow from the mrs sets  @xcite ) , @xmath43 is the intrinsic component and @xmath44 parameterizes the effects of the enhanced component .",
    "( the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath41 and @xmath45 is implicit and of little relevance to what follows since we will only consider scattering within a small range of @xmath0 values ; therefore the renormalization group running with @xmath0 can be ignored . ) for simplicity , suppose that @xmath46 is exactly 1 everywhere except in a small range of @xmath2 centered on @xmath47 for which it is much greater and roughly constant ( , it is roughly a top hat distribution ) : _ q(x)=1+_q(x - x_0+)(x_0 + -x ) [ epsq ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the usual step function , and @xmath50 is the half - width of the top hat . though the numerical arguments do not rely on making this assumption , it does make the pedagogy simpler .    to begin , suppose that the correct fit to the hera nc data is achieved by changing only @xmath34 such that @xmath51 , @xmath50 and @xmath52 have certain fit values",
    ". this will be the canonical scenario to which we compare all others .",
    "for example , suppose that instead of changing the @xmath34 pdfs , we would like to do a fit for which only @xmath53 is changed . then to produce the same nc cross - section that @xmath52 provided in the @xmath28-case , @xmath54 must shift by a larger amount , though at the same @xmath47 .",
    "that the shift must be larger is clear , because @xmath38-quark effects on the nc cross - section are suppressed both by electric charge ( the 1/4 ) and by the smaller @xmath38-quark content in the proton , @xmath55 . in terms of an equation , setting the shift due to the @xmath56 in the one case equal to the new shift by @xmath57 : _",
    "u(x_0)u_0(x_0)+d_0(x_0)=u_0(x_0)+_d(x_0 ) d_0(x_0 ) , giving @xmath58 , with all functions evaluated at @xmath47 . to get the same effect by enhancing @xmath35 alone requires @xmath59 at @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , changing @xmath60 alone is identical to the case of @xmath53 , but with @xmath61 in the expression above .",
    "what effects do these changes have on the charged current ? in terms of the pdfs , the cc cross - sections scale as : d(x)(1-y)^2+|u(x ) + , u(x ) +    scattering in @xmath62 $ ] mode , and @xmath63 has its usual definition in deep inelastic scattering . in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the @xmath66 scattering angle",
    "; its presence in the expressions above follows trivially from angular momentum conservation in the @xmath67 scattering process .",
    "note also that for the usual pdfs at large @xmath2 , to a very good approximation @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    for the moment , in order to examine the effects of enhancing the pdfs on the cc differential cross - section , we will restrict ourselves to the region around @xmath47 of half - width @xmath50 .",
    "we will denote the differential cross - section in this small region @xmath70 as a shorthand .",
    "in the first case discussed above , in which only @xmath71 is changed in response to the nc data , the cc signal in @xmath72 mode is unchanged , while @xmath73 increases by @xmath52 .",
    "thus the same relative change in the nc data will also occur in the @xmath3 cc data , at least in the neighborhood of @xmath47 .",
    "however , because the kinematic dependence on @xmath2 ( at high-@xmath0 ) is roughly the same in @xmath74 as in @xmath75 , the relative scaling of the nc to cc in the @xmath51-region will hold for all @xmath2 .",
    "( the preceding statement is exact in the limit @xmath76 and when the @xmath31 contribution to nc can be ignored .",
    "since these two conditions are not simultaneously satisfied in general , there will be important corrections to the results of these heuristic arguments . nonetheless , the results derived here do not differ greatly from the exact results , as we will see . ) thus , to have a concrete example , if @xmath52 is chosen to double the high @xmath0 nc cross - section , it will also ( approximately ) double the high-@xmath0 cc cross - section in @xmath30 mode , while having no effect in @xmath72 mode .",
    "the effect on the cc is more marked in the case of using @xmath53 to explain the nc anomaly . as we said above , to have the same effect on the nc data as @xmath56",
    ", the @xmath57 must be roughly @xmath77 $ ] times bigger than the corresponding @xmath56 would have been . and",
    "since to a good approximation d^+_cc(x_0)_d(x_0)4 _",
    "u(x_0 ) , it will scale by the same amount .",
    "consider again our example , where we demanded that @xmath52 double the high-@xmath0 nc data .",
    "for @xmath78 one finds @xmath79 . then to fit the same nc data",
    ", @xmath54 must be @xmath80 times larger than @xmath52 . moving this enhancement to the cc one finds that @xmath81 increases by a factor of @xmath82 , while @xmath83 is unchanged . again",
    "the explicit kinematic dependences on @xmath2 are ( approximately ) the same in the cc and nc , so the overall @xmath84 will increase by roughly a factor of 32 in the high-@xmath0 region .",
    "the same arguments go through for @xmath39 and @xmath40 . for @xmath39 ,",
    "@xmath81 scales by a factor d^+_cc(x_0)1 + , while @xmath83 is unchanged .",
    "for explaining the hera anomaly we would be interested in @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and thus @xmath87 . then in our recurring example wherein the nc signal is doubled , @xmath81 scales by a factor of @xmath88 , leading to an overall scaling of @xmath84 again by 32 .    in the final case , with enhanced @xmath60 , @xmath73 scales by a factor d^-_cc(x_0)1 + 4(_u-1)(1-y)^2 while @xmath84 is unchanged .",
    "in our recurring example , with @xmath89 , we find @xmath73 scales by approximately @xmath56 , so that the full @xmath83 at high-@xmath0 is expected to be double the usual sm prediction .",
    "the various scalings of the cc mode are summarized in table  [ tungtable ] .",
    ".for each parton is shown the relative sizes of contributions needed to explain the hera nc data , as well as the predictions for the enhancement of the cc signal , @xmath70 .",
    "all quantities are implicitly functions of @xmath2 and are to be evaluated at @xmath47 .",
    "these results are derived in the heuristic scenario discussed in the text .",
    "note that for @xmath90 the scaling factors are independent of @xmath56 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ fittable ]    the most important h1 cuts have been included in the calculation : @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "our pedagogical derivation of the enhancements has been shown to work reasonably well , though not exactly .",
    "the two pdfs which affect the @xmath1 mode both induce very large corrections in the cc if they are invoked to explain the nc data .",
    "however the two pdfs which affect the @xmath3 mode induce small , but observable , corrections .",
    "given high statistics , hera should be able to probe even the hardest case , that of changing @xmath60 to explain the nc data . with the current data",
    ", it already appears that altering @xmath53 or @xmath35 can not be invoked to explain the nc anomaly .",
    "the possibility exists of probing more complicated combinations of modifications because the cross - sections at hera are linear in the pdfs .",
    "therefore in a scenario in which several of the pdfs are modified so that the total modification is a sum of individual parton modifications , weighted by some @xmath93 , then the resulting cc signals are also linear combinations of those shown , again weighted by the @xmath93 .",
    "for example , if enhancements to the @xmath28 and @xmath38 are such that each one contributes half of the nc excess , then the cc signal will be an average of the individual signals for @xmath28 and @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , the intrinsic charm scenario , for which @xmath94 is responsible for explaining the hera data , the @xmath81 is scaled by @xmath95 and @xmath73 is scaled by @xmath96 where @xmath97 . this linear behavior provides a powerful , and simple , way to disentangle the form of the modifications given the size of the excesses over sm in the two cc modes . unfortunately , with only 2 data points for 4 unknowns , one can not deduce the full answer using cc data alone .",
    "however , it is already enough to rule out the intrinsic charm scenario as an explanation of the nc data , given the numbers in table  [ fittable ] .",
    "modifying the pdfs to explain the hera @xmath1 nc data implies an immediate modification ( by about the same relative size ) of the @xmath3 nc data , and also implies striking patterns of modification in the cc data .",
    "such modifications should be easy to observe given the current size of the nc anomaly .",
    "further , they already rule out the intrinsic charm scenario ( with equal modifications to @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) , or any other attempt to use modifications of @xmath38-type or @xmath39-type distribution functions to account for the anomaly in the hera nc data .",
    "our results for the cc channel are summarized in table  [ fittable ] and figure  [ figure ] .",
    "if an excess in the cc signal is detected at hera in the @xmath1 data of the size currently suggested by h1 , then one must go to a scenario in which more than one pdf are modified , but such that one dominates the contribution to the @xmath1 nc excess .",
    "this will lead to an interesting signal at hera in the @xmath3 cc mode .",
    "in particular , once significant luminosity has been collected in @xmath3 mode at hera , one should also be able to probe solutions to the nc anomaly which involve only changing the distributions of @xmath28- and @xmath40-type quarks .",
