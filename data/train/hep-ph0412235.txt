    "the strong interest in the processes of elastic neutral vector meson electroproduction on a nucleon , @xmath2 where @xmath3 , or heavy quarkonium @xmath4 , is related with the possibility to constrain the gluon density in a nucleon @xcite .",
    "the large negative virtuality of the photon , @xmath5 , or ( in a case of quarkonium photoproduction ) the heavy quark mass , @xmath6 , provides a hard scale for the process which justifies the application of qcd factorization methods that allow to separate the contributions to the amplitude coming from different scales .",
    "the amplitude of light vector meson electroproduction is given by a convolution of the nonperturbative meson distribution amplitude ( da ) and the generalized parton densities ( gpds ) with the perturbatively calculable hard - scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the direct application of factorization theorem @xcite to the production of a heavy meson is restricted to the region of very large virtualities , @xmath7 , where the mass of the heavy quark may be completely neglected .",
    "in contrast , in photoproduction or electroproduction at moderate virtualities the heavy quark mass provides a hard scale and the nonrelativistic nature of heavy meson is important . in this case , according to nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) which provides a systematic nonrelativistic expansion , a factorization formalism must be constructed in terms of matrix elements of nrqcd operators .",
    "they are characterized by their different scaling behavior with respect to @xmath8 , the typical velocity of the heavy quark . in the leading approximation",
    "only the matrix element @xmath9 contributes , which describes in nrqcd the leptonic meson decay rate @xcite @xmath10=\\frac{2e_q^2\\pi\\alpha^2}{3 } \\frac{\\langle o_1\\rangle_v } { m^2 } \\left ( 1-\\frac{8\\alpha_s}{3\\pi}\\right)^2 \\ , .",

    "we present our recent results for the hard scattering amplitudes at next - to - leading order both for heavy quarkonium photoproduction @xcite and for light vector meson electroproduction @xcite processes .",
    "the account of the radiative correction to the hard scattering amplitudes allows to reduce the theoretical uncertainty of the factorization approach , the dependence on the factorization , @xmath16 , and renormalization , @xmath17 , scales , which is especially important at high energies , since in this case ( i.e. in the small @xmath18 region ) the dependence of the parton distributions on the factorization scale is very strong .",
    "in the leading order of the relativistic expansion the meson mass can be taken as twice the heavy quark pole mass , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the proton mass .",
    "the photon polarization is described by the vector @xmath23 , @xmath24 . the invariant c.m .",
    "energy is @xmath25 .",
    "we define @xmath26    at @xmath27 the factorization formula reads @xmath28 \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ & & f^{q , s } ( x,\\xi , t)=\\sum_{q = u , d , s }   f^q ( x,\\xi , t ) \\ , . \\label{fact1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the sum of the gluon , @xmath29 , and the quark , @xmath30 , gpds contributions .",
    "gpds are defined as a functions which parametrized the matrix elements of the renormalized light - cone quark and gluon operators .",
    "the polarization vector of quarkonium is @xmath31 , variable @xmath32 parametrizes the non vanishing longitudinal momentum transfer in the process .",
    "the hard scattering amplitude @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) represents essentially the on - shell parton amplitude for the scattering of a pair of gluons ( quarks ) which are collinear to the proton momentum and have the fractions @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "calculated in the dimensional regularization method these one - loop amplitudes contain poles , the infrared collinear and the ultraviolet singularities .",
    "the full renormalization procedure includes mass counterterm diagrams , the renormalization of the heavy quark field and the renormalization of the strong coupling .",
    "the factorization of collinear singularities is achieved by the replacement of the bare gpds by the renormalized ones .",
    "this procedure leads to the finite results for @xmath33 and @xmath34 at nlo @xmath37 \\ , , \\nonumber \\label{ttg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath38 .",
    "the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( see @xcite ) contain terms @xmath41 .",
    "the dependence of nlo hard scattering amplitudes on @xmath16 compensates partially the effect of the evolution of gpds with factorization scale ( the dependence of @xmath42 and gpds on @xmath16 in ( [ fact1 ] ) is not shown for shortness ) .",
    "that leads to the substantial reduction of the scale ambiguity of the theoretical predictions in nlo in comparison with leading order ( lo ) , see fig .  1    [ 5 ]",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the complete set of analytical results and for some numerical predictions for the light vector meson electroproduction at nlo .",
    "the new features in comparison to quarkonium production are the contribution of the quark gpd at lo and the appearance of a light meson da in the factorization formulae ( instead of nrqcd matrix element ) .    similarly to the quarkonium production case",
    "we observe that in hera kinematic range the nlo corrections are large and mostly of the opposite signs than the corresponding born terms , consequently the final values of the amplitude are the result of a strong cancelation between the lo and nlo parts .",
    "leading contribution to the nlo correction comes from the integration region @xmath43 , simplifying the gluon hard - scattering amplitude in this limit we obtain the estimate @xmath44 @xmath45 \\ , , \\nonumber & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath46 is a meson coupling constant known from @xmath47 decay , @xmath48 , factor @xmath49 depends on the meson flavor content @xcite , @xmath50 .",
    "given the behavior of the gluon gpd at small @xmath18 , @xmath51 , we see that nlo correction is parametrically large , @xmath52 , and negative unless one chooses the value of the factorization scale sufficiently lower than the kinematic scale . for the asymptotic form of meson da , @xmath53 , the last term in ( [ appr ] )",
    "changes the sign at @xmath54 , for the da with a more broad shape this happens at even lower values of @xmath16 .       as a function of @xmath55 for two nlo gpds : mrst2001 ( m ) and cteq6 m ( c ) . the factorization scale @xmath56 . for the solid lines @xmath57 , for the dashed lines @xmath58 .",
    "the data points are taken from @xcite . ]    our leading twist results , see fig .  2 ,",
    "obtained with nlo hard - scattering amplitudes and nlo gpds @xcite ( which were adjusted to describe hera deeply virtual compton scattering data ) are in qualitative agreement with the measured at hera @xmath59 meson electroproduction cross section . without account of nlo terms the predictions would be substantially above the data .",
