    "the rich phase structure of matter at high baryon density has attracted much interest over decades theoretically and phenomenologically . at sufficiently high density and low temperature , wherever quarks feel an attractive force as is suggested from the one gluon exchange between quarks that are antisymmetric in color , the fermi surface of quark matter is unstable against forming a cooper pair whose condensation leads to color superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "it is well established that the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase is a ground state of three - flavor quark matter in the asymptotically high density region where the strange quark mass @xmath0 is negligible as compared with the quark chemical potential @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "if it is realized in a bulk system like the cores of compact stellar objects , quark matter must be neutral in electric and color charges  @xcite .",
    "as long as @xmath16 is negligibly small , three - flavor quark matter , which is composed of the equal number of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 quarks , satisfies electric and color neutrality on its own regardless of whether it is in the normal or cfl phase .",
    "when @xmath0 comes to have a substantial effect suppressing @xmath14 quarks , there arise various possibilities in forming cooper pairs and in achieving neutrality , that brings intricate subtleties into the phase structure especially in the intermediate density region where @xmath0 can compete @xmath15 .    when the system is normal quark matter , a finite electron density is required to neutralize the system electrically because the number of @xmath14 quarks is reduced by @xmath17 . in cfl",
    "quark matter , on the other hand , neutrality can be fulfilled even without electrons rigidly at zero temperature  @xcite and approximately at low temperatures below an insulator - metal crossover  @xcite .",
    "this is because the bcs ansatz for cooper pairing between cross - species of quarks enforces equality in the numbers of red , green , blue , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 quarks and thus neutrality . at zero temperature , another candidate ,",
    "that is , the two - flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase , is known to cost a larger free energy than the cfl phase under the neutrality conditions , or , it could exist for strong coupling between quarks in some density windows  @xcite .",
    "electronless and neutral cfl quark matter lasts as long as the fermi energy mismatch when two quarks were not paired , which is given by @xmath18 as explained later , is less than the energy gap @xmath19 .",
    "there should appear a new state of matter once the energy gain by releasing the pressure between cross - species of quarks surpasses the gap energy , which occurs when @xmath20 .",
    "then , some of quark energy dispersion relations pass across zero and their pairing is disrupted in the corresponding momentum ( blocking ) region that is from one zero to another zero of the quark excitation energy .",
    "the new state is called the gapless cfl ( gcfl ) phase  @xcite and , if any other phase transitions such as the chiral phase transition and the transition to a crystalline color superconductor  @xcite lie at lower densities than the gapless onset , the gcfl phase must show up next as the density goes down from the cfl side .",
    "the gapless or breached pairing superconductivity was first discussed in a non - relativistic model and was recognized as an unstable state  @xcite and its analogue in three - flavor quark matter was considered in ref .",
    "it was discovered later on that stable gapless superconductivity could be possible under the constraint of particle number fixing in a non - relativistic model  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for more discussions on stability ) and of electric and color neutrality in the gapless regime of the 2sc ( g2sc ) phase  @xcite .",
    "besides gapless superconductivity , there is another competing possibility , i.e.  the mixed phase , to realize neutrality  @xcite , and if the mixed phase has a lower free energy , the gapless phase would not come to realization . according to ref .",
    "@xcite it can be the case in fact for the g2sc phase which should be taken over energetically by the mixed phase where normal and color superconducting phases coexist , and consequently the g2sc phase may be less of a reality .",
    "it must deserve further investigation , however , especially with the screening effects in the mixed phase taken into account to declare the existence or non - existence of the ( g)2sc phase . in the case of the gcfl phase ,",
    "on the other hand , the free energy comparison indicates that the gcfl phase should be stable energetically apart from a minor exception of the cfl-2sc mixed phase possibility , which will be presumably ruled out , however , once the surface tension and the coulomb energy corrections are included  @xcite .",
    "hence , so far , the gcfl phase remains as a likely candidate for the ground state at moderate density and is considered to be relevant to neutron star physics  @xcite .    however , chromomagnetic instability first found in the g2sc phase  @xcite and later confirmed also in the gcfl phase  @xcite implies that the gapless phase is not stable against perturbation of transverse ( chromomagnetic ) gluon fields and the true ground state must need something further .",
    "it is negative meissner masses squared , i.e. , imaginary meissner masses , that the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite have actually revealed in the gapless phases .",
    "since the meissner mass is the screening mass for transverse gluons , the instability signifies spontaneous generation of the expectation value of gauge fields . keeping in mind a simple relation in superconductors between the gauge fields and currents in the london gauge",
    ", we can regard chromomagnetic instability as color current generation .",
    "( an interpretation of instability as spontaneous _",
    "current generation has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) to put it another way , it is possible to interpret it as instability towards a state characterized by diquark condensates with color - dependent oscillation in coordinate space  @xcite , because gauge fields in the quark propagator generally reside in the form of the covariant derivative .",
    "this state of quark matter is a sort of crystalline color superconductors under the single _ colored _ plain wave ansatz .",
    "it should be worth emphasizing that the difference is only in intuitive pictures , and in effect , these above interpretations are equivalent , which is mathematically described by the gauge transformation .",
    "still , anyway , it is controversial what the true ground state should be that supersedes the homogeneous gcfl phase .     on the phase diagram ( see fig .  1 in ref",

    "we shall write @xmath26 for instance to mean whichever of @xmath2 or @xmath3 equivalently from now on .",
    "as for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and the electromagnetic field @xmath10 , on the other hand , mixing between them arises and thus we have to refer to eigenvalues of the @xmath27 mass squared matrix to investigate instability .",

    "in the vicinity of the phase boundary line on which one of three gaps vanishes , i.e. , @xmath31 , there comes out a rather complicated structure which is not robust but strongly depends on a choice of the coupling strength .",
    "we will not present results for other coupling cases as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , for our purpose here is not to disclose the phase structure but to argue characteristic features of chromomagnetic instability and to settle where it becomes relevant on the phase diagram .",
    "we observe that instability grows for @xmath26 as soon as the gcfl state occurs at zero temperature .",
    "the instability penetrates from the cfl region where all @xmath12-@xmath13 , @xmath13-@xmath14 , and @xmath14-@xmath12 quarks make cooper pairs into the usc region where @xmath12-@xmath13 and @xmath14-@xmath12 quarks remain to pair , but never enters the 2sc region where only the @xmath12-@xmath13 quark pairing gap is nonvanishing .",
    "actually in the 2sc phase , @xmath26 become irrelevant to the higgs - anderson mechanism , and therefore the meissner mass for @xmath26 must be zero there .",

    "there is no discrimination between @xmath32 and @xmath22 and the difference is manifested only when quark matter lies in the cfl or usc phase .",
    "our mapping is consistent with all of the known results both in the 2sc phase  @xcite and in the cfl phase  @xcite ; no instability takes place near the gcfl onset for @xmath32 nor @xmath22 , while the large @xmath33 regions exhibit instability which turns out to be related to the g2sc instability . at small temperatures and large @xmath33 the meissner masses squared for @xmath32 and @xmath22",
    "are negative until the system reaches the phase boundary from which the system enters the phase of unpaired quark matter ( uqm ) .",

    "there are two distinct regions where instability remains .",
    "the instability near the gcfl onset eventually disappears as the temperature grows , while the instability at larger @xmath33 goes further into the 2sc phase .",
    "in fact in the 2sc phase , @xmath8 decouples from others and its meissner mass is reduced to zero , and one of the two eigenmodes composed of @xmath9 and @xmath10 exhibits chromomagnetic instability as is consistent with the findings in the g2sc phase  @xcite . for even stronger coupling when the 2sc ( not necessarily g2sc ) phase is possible at zero temperature ( see fig .",
    "17 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we have numerically checked that instability at larger @xmath33 starts exactly at the g2sc onset .",
    "the exact correspondence between the gapless and instability onsets is apparent only at zero temperature since the finite - temperature effects allow for thermal quark excitations which are not clearly distinguishable from quarks in the blocking region .",
    "an interesting manifestation of this is the unstable region in the usc phase in which there are no gapless quarks below @xmath34 ( see the dotted curve in the usc region shown in fig .  1 in ref .",

    "it is instructive to compile all these slices and map respective unstable regions onto the phase diagram .",
    "figure  [ fig : gaps ] is one example to locate the phase boundary and the unstable region and to see them on a common basis . in this way we clarified the unstable regions on the phase diagram as we have already discussed at the beginning of this paper .",
    "in summary , in dense neutral three - flavor quark matter , we figured out the computational procedure to derive the debye and meissner screening masses from curvatures of the thermodynamic potential with respect to gluon source fields .",
    "we investigated chromomagnetic instability by changing the temperature @xmath1 and the fermi momentum mismatch @xmath33 and explored the unstable regions for respective gluons and photon on the phase diagram involving the ( g)cfl , usc , and ( g)2sc phases .",
    "we can say that the instability lines we added on the renewed phase diagram tell us , at least , at what @xmath15 or @xmath0 the homogeneous ( g)cfl , usc , and ( g)2sc phases remain to be stable at a certain @xmath1 . from the present work , however , we can not extract any clue about what is going on inside the unstable regions .",
    "one possible solution would be a crystalline - like phase as is suggested in the two - flavor case  @xcite .",
    "if this is true also in three - flavor quark matter , it is most likely that the instability lines are to be regarded as the boundaries that separate the homogeneous and crystalline superconducting phases . in this sense ,",

    "[ fig : phase12 ] , [ fig : phase4567 ] , and [ fig : phase380 ] have a definite physical meaning even after a true ground state inside the unstable regions will be identified .",
    "strictly speaking , once chromomagnetic instability occurs in any gluon channel , it would affect the other gluon channels .",
    "consequently instability lines with respect to one gluon going inside the unstable region with respect to another gluon might be substantially different from what we have seen in this work .",
    "they are actually the most outer boundaries only that separate the homogeneous and crystalline phases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_all ] .",
    "our approach here is essentially along the same line as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and so this work leaves the same open questions enumerated in ref .",
    "@xcite ; how gauge field fluctuations affect the critical point and the order of respective phase transitions  @xcite , what the nature of @xmath277-condensation in the gcfl phase is and how it affects instability  @xcite , what difference the t  hooft ( instanton ) interaction makes that induces an interaction like @xmath278 , where the chiral phase transition is located and how our ( @xmath33-@xmath1 ) phase diagram is mapped onto the ( @xmath15-@xmath1 ) plane with @xmath0 solved dynamically .",
    "in addition to these above mentioned issues , we should make an improvement how to take account of @xmath0 fully .",
    "the derivation of our formula ( [ eq : potential_meissner ] ) needs the energy projection operator for massless quarks and works out as long as the @xmath0 effects can be well - approximated by a chemical potential shift . from this reason",
    ", we could not augment the phase diagrams for stronger couplings ( figs .",
    "16 and 17 in ref .",
    "@xcite for example ) with the instability lines .",
    "the improvement could be implemented by the full angle - integration in @xmath245 to acquire @xmath242 .    from the theoretical point of view , logarithmic divergences that have been simply neglected in the present work must be taken seriously .",
    "in particular , logarithmic terms depending on @xmath0 seem to remain even in the normal phase  @xcite , while in our work the meissner masses turn out to be zero properly in the normal phase , suggesting some cancellation mechanism between @xmath0 dependent divergences .",
    "this must be further investigated in a field - theoretical way .",
    "another problem of theoretical interest is how much singularities are inhibited by non - perturbative resummation .",
    "however small the coupling constant @xmath122 is , the polarization is divergently large at the one - loop level , and generally , that demands a sort of resummation , for instance , by means of the ladder approximation . the instability might not be cured itself by resummation , but the singularities near the gcfl onset would be possibly smoothened .",
    "phenomenologically , since not only the gcfl but also the g2sc phase is within our scope especially once we will be able to approach the stronger coupling case , it is inevitable to examine the competition between the mixed and crystalline phases around the g2sc region .",
    "the entanglement between these phase possibilities should play an important role to complement the phase diagram for the large @xmath0 or moderate density region  @xcite .",
