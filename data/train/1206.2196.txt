    "state preparation for many - particle systems is gaining increasing attention recently .",
    "states with desired quantum entanglement properties find important applications in quantum information processing , cryptography , and computation @xcite .",
    "indeed efforts in this direction can be found in areas as diverse as quantum dots @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , and cold atoms @xcite , to name a few .",
    "it has also been recognized recently that similar ideas can be used to create exotic many - body states in cold atoms .",
    "many of these states are of particular interest in the condensed matter context .",
    "examples of such proposals include the haldane state for a spin-1 lattice @xcite , resonant valence bond states @xcite , antiferromagnetic states @xcite , d - wave `` superconductivity '' @xcite , luttinger liquids @xcite , and even states that correspond to highest energy ( instead of ground ) state for a given hamiltonian @xcite . in this paper , we would like to discuss our proposal to generate a total hyperfine spin - zero singlet pair , starting from two particles that each has hyperfine spin-1 or 2 .",
    "our primary motivation is that the ground states of certain one ( spatial ) dimensional lattice of bosons with one atom per site and with suitable interaction between the bosons are expected to be in the dimerized state @xcite . in this state ,",
    "the lattice translational symmetry is spontaneously broken so that the spin - correlation between neighboring sites alternate between strong and weak .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that this dimerized state is smoothly connected to the ground state of a new hamiltonian where alternate bonds are weakened @xcite . in the limit where the alternate bonds are weakened completely to zero , we have a collection of isolated singlet pairs .",
    "the system remains gapped throughout this process . reversing the argument , once singlet pairs can be prepared , in principle one",
    "can then obtain the many - body dimerized state of the original hamiltonian by gradually turning on the coupling between the pairs .",
    "a similar argument can also be applied generally to valence bond states . thus preparing",
    "the singlets would be a useful first step in generating these unconventional magnetic states .",
    "irrespective of whether we can ultimately obtain the dimerized states experimentally using this method , we believe that our proposals of generating singlet pairs of hyperfine spin-1 and spin-2 particles are of interest in their own right . while most literature on quantum information and cryptography deals with particles with only two internal states ( e.g. spin - up versus down for spin-@xmath2 particles or horizontal versus vertical polarization for photons ) , it is known that higher dimensional quantum systems ( _ i.e. _ systems with more than two internal states ) offer many advantages such as higher tolerance in noise in quantum key distribution @xcite or tests of bell inequalities @xcite . a spin - singlet state of two spin-1 ( 2 ) particles is ( one of ) the most entangled two - particle state in a dimension 3 ( 5 ) quantum system . it is therefore of high interest to know how to generate them , and here we offer a scheme starting from completely unentangled initial states@xcite .",
    "we shall discuss two schemes .",
    "the first is simply to vary an external magnetic field adiabatically .",
    "this scheme is simple , but would work only in very special cases .",
    "the second , the central work of this paper , is a dynamical scheme .",
    "the main idea is to exploit the spin changing dynamics of two interacting particles in the presence of a ( generally time - dependent ) quadratic zeeman field .",
    "this dynamics has been studied experimentally by widera et al @xcite . however , their focus was to extract the spin dependent interaction parameters ( the spin dependent s - wave scattering lengths ) . we shall show that , for proper choice of parameters , one can prepare pure spin - singlet pairs using this spin changing dynamics .",
    "we introduce our proposal for hyperfine spin-1 particles in section [ sec : one ] . the case for hyperfine spin-2 particles",
    "is discussed in section [ sec : two ] . in these two sections ,",
    "we emphasize the basic ideas and simplify our analysis by putting the magnetic field to be zero during some time intervals .",
    "the generalization to the cases where the magnetic fields are always finite are discussed in section [ sec : three ] .",
    "the conclusions are in section [ sec : four ] . in appendix",
    "a we provide some details of our estimate on the fidelity of our scheme . for simplicity , we shall occasionally use `` spins '' for hyperfine spins when there is no danger of confusion .",
    "we assume that one can initially prepare two particles in a potential well ( or a double well , the detailed shape of the potential does not matter ) , each with hyperfine state @xmath3 . in this ( next )",
    "section @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this initial state has also been obtained by widera et al @xcite .",
    "we shall assume that these particles reside and stay in the lowest motional ground state throughout the dynamics , thus their spins are the only degrees of freedom .",
    "a quantum mechanical state can therefore be indicated only by the quantum numbers @xmath6 s of the two particles . for simplicity we shall suppress the @xmath7 labels .",
    "thus @xmath8 would indicate that both particles have @xmath9 , whereas @xmath10 indicates that there is one particle each in the @xmath11 state .",
    "since we are dealing with bosons , only symmetric states need to be kept .",
    "the subscripts @xmath12 remind us that we are using the @xmath6 basis .",
    "since we are interested in obtaining a total spin singlet , we would also like to keep track of the total hyperfine spin @xmath13 of the two particles .",
    "it is therefore also convenient to use the basis @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the projection of @xmath13 .",
    "we only need to consider even @xmath13 s .",
    "the subscripts @xmath13 would be used to remind us when we are using this basis .",
    "the conservation of total @xmath12 implies that we only need to consider the two states @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we consider the time evolution of these particles under the presence of a ( in general time - dependent ) quadratic zeeman field .",
    "the linear zeeman field needs not be considered due to the conservation of total @xmath12 and hence @xmath18 within our proposed schemes .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of simply two terms : the quadratic zeeman energy and the interaction energy .",
    "the first contribution is a single particle term .",
    "it represents a @xmath6 dependent energy quadratic in magnetic field @xmath19 ( for not too large @xmath19 s ) and can be written in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 with @xmath22 a coefficient depending on the atom under consideration .",
    "the interaction energy is diagonal in the total hyperfine spin basis @xmath23 and @xmath17 .",
    "we shall denote these interaction energies by @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "we first discuss the adiabatic scheme .",
    "the singlet state can be generated by adiabatically varying the external field @xmath19 hence @xmath26 if both the initial and final states are either the highest or the lowest energy states when @xmath26 varies .",
    "suppose @xmath26 is positive .",
    "then the initial state @xmath27 is the lowest energy state for large @xmath26 . if @xmath28 , then the singlet state is also the ground state at @xmath29 .",
    "hence , if the initial @xmath27 state was produced at sufficiently large @xmath26 , then decreasing the magnetic field to zero would automatically generate the singlet @xmath30 state .",
    "such a scheme would not work of @xmath31 @xcite , or their difference is too small for adiabaticity to be satisfied for @xmath26 to be varied in time .",
    "below we turn to our dynamical scheme which works for both @xmath32 .",
    "let us first set up the hamiltonian . in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 basis ,",
    "the interaction part of the energy is simply a diagonal matrix , h_i = ( e_0 & 0 + 0 & e_2 ) .",
    "since we are targeting the state @xmath35 as the final state , we shall work in this basis .",
    "it is simple to rewrite @xmath36 in this @xmath37 basis since , from the clebsch - gordan coefficients , we know that | 0 0 _ f & = & ( | 1 , -1_m +     we find h_q = ( 2 & + & 1 ) .",
    "hence the total hamiltonian is h = ( e_0 & 0 + 0 & e_2 ) + ( 2 & + & 1 ) .",
    "[ h1 ] in this basis , our initial state @xmath38 is simply @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the transpose .",
    "let us consider the evolution of the state vector @xmath41 in time @xmath42 .",
    "its value can be easily found since we have simply a two - level system .",
    "@xmath43 can be rewritten as @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the pauli matrices and @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the scalar term only gives an overall phase and will be dropped below .",
    "the state vector at time @xmath42 is then given by ( u(t ) + v(t ) ) = ( cos t - i t ) ( u(0 ) + v(0 ) ) , where |h_eff | = ^1/2 .",
    "[ def - omega ] here @xmath48 is the rabi frequency .",
    "the condition that we have a singlet at time @xmath49 is @xmath50 . given that @xmath51 and @xmath52 we need    ( t^ * ) + ( cos t^ * + t^ * ) = 0 , [ int ] and hence    t^ * = 0 [ condt ] and h_eff , x + h_eff , z = 0 .",

    "the s - wave scattering lengths satisfy @xmath57 , hence @xmath28 .",
    "hence it is possible to obtain a pure singlet at time @xmath58 when we choose the magnetic field to be @xmath59 .",
    "the shortest possible time is @xmath60 . if the spatial wavefunction is @xmath61 , then @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is defined by this expression as in @xcite , and @xmath64 is the mass of the atoms .",

    "given that @xmath69 hz / g@xmath70 and if we choose @xmath71 hz , then the required magnetic field and the time to obtain a singlet are calculated to be @xmath72 g and @xmath73 ms , respectively .",

    ", this scheme can be generalized to cases where @xmath22 and @xmath53 are of the opposite sign , such as @xmath74rb .",
