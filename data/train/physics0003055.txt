    "<S> dielectronic recombination(dr ) of lithium - like ti@xmath0(@xmath1 ) ions via @xmath2 core excitations has been measured at the heidelberg heavy ion storage ring tsr . </S>",
    "<S> we find that not only external electric fields ( @xmath3  v / cm ) but also crossed magnetic fields ( 30  mt@xmath4 80  mt ) influence the dr via high-@xmath5 @xmath6-rydberg resonances . </S>",
    "<S> this result confirms our previous finding for isoelectronic cl@xmath7 ions [ bartsch t _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ , , 3779 ( 1999 ) ] that experimentally established the sensitivity of dr to @xmath8 fields . in the present investigation </S>",
    "<S> the larger @xmath9 fine structure splitting of ti@xmath0 allowed us to study separately the influence of external fields via the two series of rydberg dr resonances attached to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 excitations of the li - like core , extracting initial slopes and saturation fields of the enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for @xmath12  v / cm the field induced enhancement is about 1.8 times stronger for the @xmath13 series than for the @xmath14 series .    </S>",
    "<S> dielectronic recombination ( dr ) is a fundamental electron - ion collision process well known to be important in astrophysical and fusion plasmas ( dubau and volont 1980 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it proceeds in two steps @xmath15^ { * * } \\to a^{(q-1)+}+ h\\nu \\label{eq : dr}\\ ] ] where in the first step the initially free electron is captured into a bound state @xmath16 of the ion with simultaneous excitation of a core electron . </S>",
    "<S> this dielectronic capture ( dc , time inverse of autoionization ) can only occur if the energy @xmath17 of the incident free electron in the electron - ion center - of - mass ( c.m . ) </S>",
    "<S> frame matches the resonance condition @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the total energies of all bound electrons in the initial and in the doubly excited state , respectively . employing the principle of detailed balance </S>",
    "<S> the dc cross section can be calculated from the autoionization rate @xmath21 for a transition from the doubly excited state @xmath22 to the initial state @xmath23 : @xmath24 with @xmath25@xmath26ev@xmath27s , statistical weights @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 $ ] denoting the total width of the doubly excited state @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the summation indices @xmath31 and @xmath32 run over all states which from @xmath22 can be either reached by autoionization or by radiative transitions with rates @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .    in the second step of reaction the new charge state is stabilized by photon emission from the intermediate doubly excited state , thereby transferring the ion into a final state @xmath35 below the first ionization limit . </S>",
    "<S> this radiative stabilization competes with autoionization which would transfer the ion back into its initial charge state with the net effect being resonant electron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , in order to obtain the cross section for dr one has to multiply the dc cross section from equation by the branching ratio @xmath36/\\gamma_d$ ] for radiative stabilization . integrating the resulting expression over the c.  m.  energy and assuming @xmath37 yields the dr resonance strength due to the intermediate state @xmath22 in the isolated resonance approximation ( shore 1969 ) , i.e.@xmath38    in case of @xmath39 dr of li - like ions , i.e.  for @xmath40 core excitations , the dominant decay channels of the doubly excited intermediate state ( for very high @xmath5 ) can be identified as @xmath41 radiative and @xmath42 autoionizing transitions with rates denoted as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since the radiative transition only involves the excited core electron , its rate @xmath43 to a good approximation is independent of the quantum numbers @xmath5 and @xmath45 of the excited rydberg electron . </S>",
    "<S> neglecting all other transitions such as @xmath46 or @xmath47 , equation simplifies to @xmath48 using the rydberg resonance energy @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ; in the r.h.s  approximation @xmath52 denotes the lesser of @xmath43 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> autoionizing rates decrease as @xmath53 and even more rapidly with @xmath45 , such that at a given @xmath5 the relation @xmath54 holds only for @xmath55-rydberg states with angular momentum @xmath45 below a limit @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath57 sublevels dominantly contribute to dr for a given core state @xmath58 and consequently for the @xmath5-manifold @xmath6 of doubly excited states the resonance strength is given as @xmath59 ^ 2 s_0 \\frac{\\pi } { e_n } a_{\\rm r}.\\label{eq : sigman}\\ ] ] within this ` counting of states ' picture the effect of external electric fields on dr is readily explained . in external electric fields </S>",
    "<S> stark mixing of high-@xmath45 with low-@xmath45 levels occurs . </S>",
    "<S> this yields autoionization rates which are lower for low-@xmath45 and higher for high-@xmath45 states as compared to the field free situation . </S>",
    "<S> the net effect is an increase of @xmath56 , i.e.an increase of the number of states participating in dr . </S>",
    "<S> since high-@xmath5 rydberg states are more easily perturbed by external electric fields than low-@xmath5 states the electric field induced enhancement of dr is stronger for higher-@xmath5 @xmath6 dr resonances .    </S>",
    "<S> this effect of external _ electric _ fields on dr was recognized early by burgess and summers ( 1969 ) and jacobs ( 1976 ) . </S>",
    "<S> electric field enhancement of dr was subsequently found in numerous theoretical calculations ( hahn 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first clear experimental verification of this effect has been given by mller ( 1986 ) who investigated dr in the presence of external fields ( drf ) of singly charged mg@xmath60 ions under controlled conditions . </S>",
    "<S> further drf experiments with multiply charged c@xmath61 ions ( young 1994 , savin 1996 ) and si@xmath62 ions ( bartsch 1997 ) also revealed drastic dr rate enhancements by electric fields . especially the si@xmath62 experiment which employed merged electron and ion beams at a heavy ion storage ring equipped with an electron cooler produced results with unprecedented accuracy , enabling a detailed comparison with theory . whereas the overall agreement between experiment and theory as for the magnitude of the effect was fair , discrepancies remained in the functional dependence of the rate enhancement on the electric field strength ( bartsch 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this finding stimulated theoretical investigations of the role of the additional magnetic field which in storage ring dr experiments is always present , since it guides and confines the electron beam within the electron cooler . in a model calculation robicheaux and pindzola ( 1997 ) found that in a configuration of crossed @xmath63 and @xmath64 fields indeed the magnetic field through the mixing of @xmath65 levels influences the rate enhancement generated by the electric field through the mixing of @xmath45 levels . </S>",
    "<S> more detailed calculations ( griffin 1998a , robicheaux 1998 ) confirmed these results . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that in theoretical calculations by huber and bottcher ( 1980 ) no influence of a pure magnetic field ( @xmath66 ) on dr was found up to at least @xmath67  t.    inspired by these predictions we previously performed storage ring drf experiments using li - like cl@xmath7 ions and crossed @xmath63 and @xmath64 fields ( bartsch 1999 ) where we clearly discovered a distinct effect of the _ magnetic _ field strength on the magnitude of the @xmath63-field enhanced dr rate . shortly after that klimenko and coworkers ( 1999 ) experimentally verified that for the @xmath65-mixing to occur the crossed @xmath63 and @xmath64 arrangement is essential . for the case of parallel @xmath64 and @xmath63 fields , where @xmath65 remains a good quantum number , they did not observe any influence of the magnetic field on the measured recombination signal .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present investigation with li - like ti@xmath0 is to confirm the novel @xmath8 field effect on dr for a heavier li - like ion . </S>",
    "<S> because of the strong scaling of the fine - structure splitting with the nuclear charge the ti@xmath68(@xmath69 ) and ti@xmath68(@xmath70 ) rydberg series of dr resonances are well separated in energy . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding series limits occur at 40.12  ev and 47.81  ev , respectively ( hinnov 1989 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this energy difference is large enough that , in contrast to the cl@xmath7 experiment , here our experimental resolution permits to study the effect of external fields on both ti@xmath68(@xmath71 ) rydberg series individually .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiments were carried out at the heavy ion storage ring tsr of the max - planck - institut fr kernphysik in heidelberg . </S>",
    "<S> here we only give a brief account of the experimental procedure for drf measurements . </S>",
    "<S> details will be given in a forthcoming publication by schippers ( 2000 , and references therein ) on drf measurements with lithium - like ni@xmath72 ions .    </S>",
    "<S> beams of @xmath73ti@xmath0 ions with intensities up to almost 80  @xmath74a were stored in the ring at energies of 4.6  mev / u . </S>",
    "<S> the ion beams were cooled by interaction with a velocity - matched cold beam of electrons which was confined by a magnetic field @xmath64 ; the direction of @xmath64 defines that of the electron beam . </S>",
    "<S> the electron beam diameter was 30  mm , while that of the cooled ion beam was of the order of 2  mm . </S>",
    "<S> first , as in the standard tuning procedure of the electron cooler , the electron beam was steered so that , along the straight interaction region of 1.5  m length , the ion beam travelled on the electron beam center line and the guiding field @xmath64 pointed exactly along the ion beam ; this minimized the electric field in the frame of the ions originating from space charge and motional ( @xmath75 ) fields . a reasonably ` electric - field free ' measurement of the dr rate coefficient ( with an estimated residual field of at most @xmath76v / cm ) could then be obtained at high energy resolution by switching the energy of the electrons in the cooler to different values . </S>",
    "<S> the energy range thus covered in the center - of - mass frame includes all ti@xmath0(@xmath77 ) @xmath39 dr resonances due to the @xmath78 core excitations . </S>",
    "<S> recombined ti@xmath68 ions were magnetically separated from the parent ti@xmath0 beam and detected with an efficiency @xmath79% downbeam from the cooler behind the first bending magnet .    controlled motional electric fields in the frame of the ions </S>",
    "<S> were then applied by superimposing in the interaction region a defined transverse ( horizontal ) magnetic field @xmath80 in addition to the unchanged longitudinal field @xmath81 along the ion beam direction ( @xmath82 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this field was generated by the electron - beam steering coils along the complete straight section of the electron cooler and created a motional electric field @xmath83 in the frame of the ions at a beam velocity @xmath84 ; the total magnetic field strength @xmath85 , however , remained almost unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> progressively different electric fields were produced by varying the transverse magnetic field strength @xmath86 . at a given transverse field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath86 the electron beam ( following the magnetic field lines ) and the ion beam are misaligned by the small angle @xmath87 so that the distance of the ion beam from the center of the electron beam varies along the interaction region . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to unwanted effects due to the electron space charge : ( i ) a variation of the ( temperature average ) relative velocity between electrons and ions along the interaction path , resulting in a degraded energy resolution ; ( ii ) creation of an additional electric field @xmath88 which , in contrast to the imposed field @xmath89 , varies along the interaction region . </S>",
    "<S> low electron densities were chosen in order to keep these effects small . with electron currents of 20  ma , </S>",
    "<S> measurements were performed at an electron density of @xmath90@xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the cooler was operated at longitudinal field strengths @xmath81= 30 , 41.8 , 60.0 and 80.1  mt . </S>",
    "<S> transverse fields of @xmath92mt ( measured with an uncertainty of @xmath93% ) were applied , corresponding to controlled motional electric fields @xmath94 up to 280  v / cm ; in all measurements the misalignment angle was kept below @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath96 of the unwanted electric space charge field and the applied motional field is expected to vary linearly along the interaction region with @xmath97 remaining always below 0.07 for all measurements with different experimental parameters .    before each energy scan with an imposed electric field @xmath89 , </S>",
    "<S> ions were injected into the ring , accumulated and then cooled for 1s . </S>",
    "<S> after that , the cathode potential of the cooler was offset from cooling by about 1  kv ( corresponding to 55  ev in the center - of - mass frame ) and then , the steering coils were set to produce a defined transverse magnetic field @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> next , the center - of - mass energy was ramped down from about 55  ev to 1  ev within 4s thus completing a first mini - cycle . after new ion injection and cooling ( at @xmath98 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the next magnetic steering field @xmath86 ( i.e. , next @xmath89 ) was automatically set and a new energy scan started . </S>",
    "<S> the mini - cycles , covering one complete energy scan each , were repeated for a set of pre - chosen magnetic steering fields . a grand cycle through typically 11 values of @xmath83 thus took about 2 minutes and such cycles were repeated until a satisfying level of statistical uncertainty ( below 3% per channel ) had been reached .    </S>",
    "<S> sets of recombination rate measurements were made for different longitudinal fields @xmath81 . using measured beam currents </S>",
    "<S> the spectra were calibrated , reaching an uncertainty of @xmath99 for absolute and @xmath100 for relative rate coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the center - of - mass energies were determined ( with uncertainties below @xmath101% ) from the average relative velocities of electrons and ions , accounting for the angle between the electron and the ion beam due to the applied transverse field @xmath86 .    </S>",
    "<S> a typical set of measurements is presented in figure  [ ti19spectra ] and shows the two series of rydberg resonances converging to the @xmath14 and @xmath13 core excitation limits . </S>",
    "<S> a significant enhancement of the rate coefficient with increasing electric field @xmath89 is observed for high rydberg states @xmath102 , while for the lower - lying resonances the rate coefficient remains constant .    </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of the dr via high rydberg states is quantified by extracting rate coefficients integrated over different energy regions of the measured spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the integrals @xmath103 and @xmath104 extend over the energy ranges 33.440.57  ev and 40.5750  ev , respectively , and represent the high - rydberg contributions of the @xmath105 and @xmath106 series of rydberg resonances with @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> for normalization purposes we also monitor the integral @xmath108 ( integration range 424  ev ) comprising dr contributions from lower @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the maximum quantum number of rydberg resonances contributing to the measured recombination rate is limited by field ionization in the charge analyzing dipole magnet . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account also radiative decay of high rydberg states on the way from the cooler to the dipole magnet , we estimate the maximum quantum number to be @xmath109 .    the high - rydberg contributions @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) monotonically increase with @xmath94 , while the lower-@xmath5 contribution @xmath112 remains constant . in order to provide a quantity for the following discussion that is independent of the normalization of the individual spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we consider ratios @xmath113 of the high-@xmath5 to the low-@xmath5 contribution in a single dr spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the electric - field enhancement factor @xmath114 then directly measures the influence of the external electric field on the dr rates via high rydberg states . </S>",
    "<S> the constants @xmath115 have been chosen such that fits to the data points ( see below ) yield @xmath116 .    </S>",
    "<S> the field enhancement factors @xmath117 and @xmath118 found for different @xmath81 are shown in figure  [ ti19rj ] as a function of @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement factors turn out to be independent of the sign of @xmath89 , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> the formula @xmath119\\right\\ } \\label{eq : fit}\\ ] ] which we have fitted to the measured enhancement factors , provides a useful parameterization of our data . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters which have been varied during the fits ( at fixed values of @xmath81 ) are the saturation field @xmath120 and the initial slope @xmath121 ; tangents to @xmath122 at @xmath123 , representing the initial slopes are also displayed in figure [ ti19rj ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the @xmath124 data points are slightly above the fitted lines . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that zero applied field @xmath123 still implies a residual electric field @xmath125v / cm so that the measured dependence of @xmath126 near @xmath123 is washed out to some extent . at higher electrical field strengths the measured data points drop below the ( dashed ) straight lines ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ ti19rj ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is an indication that the electric field effect is subject to saturation which occurs at higher electric field strength where the mixing of @xmath45-levels is complete . </S>",
    "<S> presently , higher electric fields are not accessible in our dr experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the fit parameter @xmath120 indicates how fast the saturation regime will be reached .    </S>",
    "<S> the values for the parameters @xmath121 and @xmath120 , which along with their uncertainties have been obtained from the fits , are displayed in figures [ ti19sj]a and [ ti19sj]b , respectively , as a function of the magnetic field @xmath81 . both @xmath127 and @xmath128 </S>",
    "<S> exhibit a strong dependence on the strength of the magnetic guiding field . </S>",
    "<S> the slopes @xmath127 decrease with increasing magnetic field both for the @xmath14 and @xmath13 series of rydberg resonances . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms our recent finding for cl@xmath7 ions ( bartsch 1999 ) where the existence of a sensitivity of dr to external _ </S>",
    "<S> magnetic _ fields in an @xmath8 field configuration was experimentally demonstrated for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath128 increase with increasing magnetic field strength , i.e.  at higher @xmath81 the saturation regime will be reached at higher electric fields @xmath129 .    while the parameters @xmath128 are not markedly different for the @xmath14 and @xmath13 series , the slopes @xmath130 are steeper than the slopes @xmath131 ( open and closed circles in figure [ ti19sj]a , respectively ) , i.e.  the relative increase of the dr line strength is stronger for the @xmath13 series of rydberg resonances than for the @xmath14 series . for a comparison to recent theoretical predictions ( griffin 1998a , 1998b ) </S>",
    "<S> we consider the ratio @xmath132 of absolute @xmath89 induced dr rate enhancements for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 series of rydberg resonances , which is practically independent of the integration ranges used for the determination of @xmath133 and @xmath134 as long as they cover nearly all dr resonances affected by the external fields . as a function of @xmath89 the ratio @xmath135 rises up to @xmath136  v / cm and then essentially stays constant at higher electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> values @xmath137 averaged over the interval 80  v/@xmath138  280  v / cm are plotted in figure [ ti19sj]c which shows that @xmath139 independent of @xmath81 .    in view of the fact that for a given @xmath5 the manifold of @xmath106 resonances contains twice as many sublevels that can be mixed by external fields as the manifold of @xmath105 resonances ( @xmath140 vs.  @xmath141 , cf .  </S>",
    "<S> equation ) one expects a value of 2 for the ratio @xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> we here observe a ratio somewhat lower than 2 similar to the value @xmath142 found in our experiments with lithium - like ni@xmath72 ions ( schippers 2000 ) . in calculations for lithium - like si@xmath62 ions ( griffin 1998a ) and c@xmath61 ions ( griffin 1998b ) ratios even less than 1 </S>",
    "<S> have been found . </S>",
    "<S> this has been attributed to the electrostatic quadrupole - quadrupole interaction between the @xmath143 and the @xmath55 rydberg electron in the intermediate doubly excited state , which more effectively lifts the degeneracy between the @xmath106 than between the @xmath105 levels . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results suggest that this effect might be weaker than theoretically predicted .    </S>",
    "<S> our data emphasize the relevance of the effect of small magnetic fields on dr via high rydberg levels in conjunction with the well - known electric - field enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> this result bears important implications upon the charge state balance of ions in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas where both , electric and magnetic fields are ubiquitous .    </S>",
