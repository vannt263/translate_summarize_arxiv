    "is thus fundamental both for sound synthesis by physical modeling @xcite and to improve the understanding of musical instruments design @xcite .",
    "one must account for the nonlinear wave propagation of both outgoing and incoming pressure waves , and not only the outgoing pressure wave as it can be done to simplify the problem @xcite .",
