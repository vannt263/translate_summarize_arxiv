    "as the largest gravitationally collapsed objects in the universe , clusters of galaxies provide a unique opportunity to study the evolution of large - scale structure .",
    "the distribution and abundance of clusters is sensitive to both the geometry of the universe and the growth of density perturbations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "currently , cluster - based constraints on cosmology are limited by systematic uncertainties in relating observables to cluster masses .",
    "most of the cluster mass is in the form of dark matter and therefore is not directly observable . instead",
    ", cluster masses are inferred through scaling relations with observable signals such as x - ray luminosity , galaxy velocity distribution , weak - lensing shear and sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) brightness .    under the model of self - similarity , where cluster evolution is dominated by gravitational processes , cluster mass scales with observable signals through simple power law relations @xcite .",
    "in this model , the intracluster medium ( icm ) is in hydrostatic equilibrium , for which the scaling to cluster mass can be predicted for a given observable .",
    "however , self - similarity does not take into account the role of non - thermal mechanisms such as turbulent gas motions in estimating cluster mass .",
    "this simple model also neglects the effects of physical processes internal to the cluster such as feedback from active galactic nuclei and star formation .",
    "numerical simulations predict that while the power law exponent of sze scaling relations will be consistent with self - similarity , the normalization does depend on the internal cluster astrophysics @xcite .",
    "an empirical measurement of the scaling relations therefore informs models of cluster astrophysics , progressing towards the needed calibration for cosmology .",
    "currently , cluster surveys are operating in the optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the millimeter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) wavelength regimes .",
    "however , optical and x - ray measurements of clusters suffer from cosmological dimming , and only the brightest and most massive clusters are detected at high redshifts ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "in contrast , the millimeter - wavelength thermal sze @xcite , where cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons inverse - compton scatter off hot intracluster electrons , is redshift - independent .",
    "sze surveys with sufficient resolution to resolve clusters , such as those performed with the south pole telescope @xcite and the atacama cosmology telescope @xcite detect clusters with a mass selection nearly independent of redshift .",
    "precision cosmology requires that mass - observable scaling relations be characterized with a high level of accuracy , including both the measurement uncertainty and the intrinsic scatter from cluster - to - cluster differences .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that sze observations are relatively insensitive to the details of cluster astrophysics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in low intrinsic scatter scaling relations and a tighter constraint on cluster mass .",
    "previous measurements of sze scaling relations include interferometric observations from the ovro / bima @xcite and sza @xcite arrays as well as imaging studies with the south pole telescope @xcite , bolocam @xcite , atacama cosmology telescope @xcite , and the planck mission @xcite . in general , those studies find that observational sze scaling relations agree with expectations based on self - similarity and that simulations including additional non - adiabatic physics are preferred .    while cluster samples selected from large surveys ( both sze and x - ray ) have well - known selection functions , studies such as the one presented in this paper that target known clusters often select them in an _ ad hoc _ manner .",
    "the influence of this sample selection on sze scaling relations is unknown .    in this paper , we study how the sze signal scales with x - ray observables related to cluster mass using observations from the apex - sz imaging bolometer array .",
    "we measure sze scaling relations using x - ray observables ( @xmath8 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) as proxies for the total cluster mass .",
    "apex - sz observed a small set of 11 clusters selected from the reflex x - ray survey ( referred to as the reflex - dxl sample @xcite ) as well as an additional 31 clusters selected in an _ ad hoc _ manner . within this full sample",
    "are clusters drawn from the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter z08 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m10 ) samples .",
    "we measure power law scaling relations for each of these three subsamples ( reflex - dxl , z08 , m10 ) and compare the results to the expectations of the self - similar model as well as numerical simulations that incorporate different physical processes in the icm .",
    "we compare the results between the three cluster samples as well as to the full apex - sz sample to investigate the effects of sample selection and uniform analysis on the measured power law and intrinsic scatter of the sze scaling relations . in this paper , we assume the _ _",

    "the sze occurs when photons from the cmb inverse compton scatter off hot electrons in the intracluster medium to higher energies @xcite .",
    "this process distorts the cmb blackbody spectrum with an amplitude proportional to the gas pressure integrated along the line - of - sight . in units of temperature",
    "the change is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the electron density and temperature of the icm , @xmath19 is the temperature of the cmb , @xmath20 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath22 is the electron rest mass energy . the integrated pressure is often parametrized in terms of the comptonization , @xmath23 . the frequency dependence @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a correction for relativistic electrons ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . for frequencies below 217 ghz ,",
    "the sze manifests itself as a decrement in the cmb spectrum , while at frequencies above 217 ghz the sze results in an increment .",
    "equation [ eqn : szeffect ] demonstrates two important characteristics of the sze .",
    "first , the sze is redshift independent since its surface brightness is expressed as a fractional change in the cmb temperature .",
    "second , the dependence on integrated pressure directly measures the thermal energy of the icm .",
    "the comptonization integrated over the solid angle of the cluster on the sky , @xmath28 measures the total thermal energy of a cluster , and is therefore expected to be a robust proxy for total mass . in this work , we integrate a parametric model of @xmath0 to a radius of @xmath29 , the radius at which the mean matter density of the cluster is 500 times the critical density of the universe , @xmath30 .",
    "assuming that clusters are in hydrostatic equilibrium , the integrated comptonization scales as a function of the icm properties according to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the expansion rate of the universe normalized to its present value , @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the gas mass fraction , and @xmath35 is the angular diameter distance of the cluster @xcite .",
    "a third proxy for cluster mass can be constructed from the combination of temperature and gas mass , @xmath36 @xcite . @xmath0",
    "scales with @xmath8 as @xmath37 and is expected to have lower intrinsic scatter than @xmath38 or @xmath39 due to the anti - correlation of systematic deviations between @xmath40 and @xmath1 .",
    "apex - sz @xcite was a transition - edge - sensor ( tes ) bolometer array located on the 12-meter atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) telescope in northern chile @xcite .",
    "the focal plane comprised a total of 280 bolometers distributed on six wafers which were cooled with closed - cycle refrigerators to an average operating temperature of @xmath41300 mk and read out using frequency domain multiplexing @xcite .",
    "the apex - sz experiment imaged sze decrements at 150 ghz with arcmin resolution over a 23 arcmin field of view ( fov ) .",
    "additional details of the apex - sz instrument are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "apex - sz completed two commissioning and seven observing runs from 2005 to 2010 . during this time",
    ", apex - sz observed the 42 clusters presented here for a total of approximately 760 hours .",
    "apex - sz executed a circular drift scan pattern that concentrated the integration time in a region around the known cluster coordinates while limiting overhead time due to telescope turn - arounds .",
    "the telescope repeated the circular scan while centered on a constant azimuth and elevation , allowing the target to drift through the fov . after completing between 11 and 20 circles ( 47 seconds per circle ) ,",
    "the telescope slewed to track the target and then repeated the circular pattern .",
    "the radius of each circle ( @xmath42@xmath43 arcmin ) was chosen from the expected radial extent of each cluster to ensure that the detectors observed the sky background during each scan .",
    "these scans resulted in a sky coverage area of approximately @xmath44 .",
    "clusters were targeted based on the availability of published x - ray measurements . in general , massive clusters ( @xmath45 kev ) were selected and the sample included both dynamically relaxed and disturbed clusters . additionally , apex - sz targeted clusters from the reflex - dxl x - ray sample @xcite , which is discussed in further detail in [ sec : sampleintro ] .",

    "however , when a bolometer is biased near the upper edge of the superconducting transition , the responsivity changes as a result of varying optical power from three sources : the elevation dependence of atmospheric airmass , the overall atmospheric opacity , and the power from an astronomical source .",
    "the last effect is sub - dominant , but it can not be neglected for the case of a bright calibrator . for most detectors in the apex - sz array , suppression of responsivity is approximately a linear function of incident optical power .",
    "however , some channels exhibit more extreme changes .",
    "we measure the responsivity of each bolometer using the elevation(@xmath228 ) dependent signal @xmath229 introduced by the circular scan pattern .",
    "this is repeated for every two minutes of data , normalizing by the changing zenith emissivity to measure @xmath230 .",
    "channels that exhibit strong nonlinear response are discarded from use in further analysis . for the remaining channels , we model the response as a linear function and use it to correct the absolute flux calibration , discarding data that deviate more than @xmath231 from the best - fit model .",
    "data with extremely large overall correction factors ( greater than 50 per cent ) are discarded .",
    "we also correct for two second order effects .",
    "first , as a bright calibration source is scanned , variable responsivity will slightly distort the measured beam shape .",
    "second , the fractional solid angle of the sidelobes relative to the main beam will be affected .",
    "based on the rms scatter around the best - fit gain models , we estimate the uncertainty in the responsivity corrections to be @xmath2265 per cent . combining this uncertainty with the calibration uncertainty from the previous section , we find that the total uncertainty in the apex - sz temperature calibration is @xmath22610 per cent .",
    "the apex - sz data set was measured in widely varying atmospheric conditions , a significant challenge when trying to measure the relatively faint sze signal . in general",
    ", the atmospheric signal is highly correlated between bolometers as spatial fluctuations in the atmosphere are much larger than the apex - sz fov .",
    "additionally , the bolometers exhibit a correlated signal due to heating of the detector array from telescope vibrations .",
    "we employ several different filtering techniques to clean the data , similar to @xcite . in order to optimize the final maps ,",
    "filtering is tailored to the specific needs of each target with the goal of sufficiently removing contamination and minimizing noise while preserving cluster signal .",
    "the first step to condition apex - sz timestreams is to parse the data into separate circles made on the sky according to the scan pattern .",
    "the circles are grouped together based on a common central azimuth and elevation and data not in a circle set are discarded .",
    "initial channel and data cuts are performed on the indexed data based on several criteria .",
    "channels that are optically unresponsive ( optical efficiency less than 6 per cent ) are rejected .",
    "apex - sz timestreams occasionally exhibit large spikes or glitches in one or many bolometers due to either cosmic rays or electrical interference .",
    "glitches are located and removed from the timestreams using both the timestream derivative and a simple s / n threshold cut .",
    "when a glitch is simultaneously detected in several channels ( more than 7 per cent ) , that particular section of data is discarded for all channels . as a final step , channels with excess noise between 12 and 18",
    "hz are discarded .    after the initial data cuts we deconvolve an optical time constant for each channel from the timestreams .",
    "the median measured optical time constant for apex - sz bolometers is @xmath4112 ms , however , it is as high as @xmath4160 ms for some channels . to prevent the amplification of high frequency noise during deconvolution , an additional low - pass filter ( @xmath232 $ ] ) is applied .",
    "we define @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the median scan velocity of the telescope and @xmath235 is the full width at half - maximum of the apex - sz beam .",
    "the final step in processing the timestream data is to remove the dominant atmospheric and thermal signals .",
    "the majority of the timestream cleaning is performed through a combination of two methods : high - pass time - domain filters and the subtraction of spatial polynomial functions across the array , taking advantage of the correlation between bolometers .",
    "an initial high - pass filter removes the static offset for each channel as well as low - frequency noise in the timestreams .",
    "removing the timestream signal due to stage heating is especially important because the subsequent spatial template removal steps use relative gain coefficients that are based solely on the atmospheric response .",
    "the high - pass filtering is implemented in two forms : an n - order polynomial removal and a butterworth frequency domain filter .",
    "the polynomial filter , described in detail in @xcite , simultaneously removes a scan synchronous cosecant signal .",
    "after the first high - pass filter , we remove a 2-dimensional spatial polynomial function across the array @xcite at each sample in the timestream . during this process , referred to as _ spatial template removal _ , we fit the polynomial either across the entire array , or individually for each of the six detector wafers to improve removal of correlated signals on scales smaller than the @xmath236 field - of - view .",
    "often , this filter is applied multiple times , discarding channels with excess variance in between .",
    "a final polynomial removal is performed to remove any remaining contamination .",
    "figure [ fig : tspowspect ] shows the power spectrum of an apex - sz timestream at three different steps in the reduction process .      once the timestreams are filtered , we create sky maps by binning the timestream data into @xmath237 arcsec pixels .",
    "sky coordinates for each bolometer are determined from the absolute telescope boresight pointing and individual bolometer positional offsets . as in @xcite , bolometers and scans are combined with a minimum variance weighting for each cluster .",
    "the resulting set of 42 sky maps is shown in figure [ fig : skymaps ] .",
    "each map has been convolved with a one arcmin fwhm gaussian for visual presentation .",
    "however , all subsequent analysis is performed on the unsmoothed version .    in conjunction with the sky map ,",
    "we quantify the effects of the apex - sz instrumental beam and analysis filtering on the sky signal . a simulated cluster map , created using the profile discussed in section [ sec : szmmodel ] , is convolved with the composite beam profile of the array and mapped into timestreams using the telescope pointing information .",
    "each data cut and filtering process performed on the real cluster data is repeated on these timestreams .",
    "the filtered simulation is mapped and coadded using the same minimum variance weights as the cluster map .",
    "an individualized transfer function map , @xmath238 , is created for each cluster by normalizing the fourier transform of the filtered map to that of the original simulation .",
    "we create difference noise maps for each cluster to characterize the map noise . in this process",
    ", random halves of the individual scan maps are multiplied by -1 before coadding .",
    "this removes any astrophysical signal that is consistent between all maps , including primary cmb anisotropy . to account for the noise due to the cmb , we convolve a realization of the cmb created from the planck + wp best - fit power spectrum @xcite with a cmb transfer function ( created in the same way as the cluster transfer function ) and add it to the difference noise map .",
    "in addition to the cmb , a contribution from a background of point sources is expected .",
    "we find that the power from poisson distributed point sources @xcite , including an extra 50 per cent variance due to lensing @xcite , is negligible in comparison to the instrument noise .        in order to calculate the integrated cluster signal ,",
    "we need to extrapolate the measured cluster signal to spatial scales that have been filtered out due to timestream processing and the angular resolution of the instrument .",

    "@xcite find that 500 varies by @xmath487 per cent under a variety of model assumptions , including the @xcite profile .",
    "the limited angular extent and strong timestream filtering of the apex - sz data prevent us from exploring different model parametrizations .",
    "however , we list the pte for the @xcite model fit to each cluster in table [ tbl : mcmc ] .",
    "if we exclude clusters which have a poor fit to the chosen @xcite model ( @xmath488 per cent of the sample with pte @xmath489 per cent or pte @xmath490 per cent ) , the power law regression parameters do not change significantly .        at the apex - sz",
    "observing frequency , emission from point sources can mask the sze signal from a cluster .",
    "we estimate the effect of radio sources by extrapolating the flux densities of sources in the nrao vla sky survey ( 1.4 ghz , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , vla first ( 1.4 ghz , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and parkes - mit - nrao ( 4.85 ghz , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) surveys to 150 ghz . assuming a power law spectral energy distribution , @xmath491 , with @xmath492 ,",
    "there are six clusters with known bright sources with @xmath493k within two arcmin of the x - ray centroid .",
    "of these six , two ( rxcj2014.8 - 2430 and macsj1931.8 - 2635 ) are not detected by apex - sz .",
    "simulations from @xcite suggest that only 1 per cent of clusters with masses similar to those observed in this paper will have radio sources at 150 ghz that contaminate the integrated cluster signal by 20 per cent or more .",
    "for the apex - sz clusters , this implies that a single cluster would suffer from radio contamination and that our estimate of six contaminated clusters is extremely conservative .",
    "we have also observed a subset of the apex - sz clusters with the carma array , searching for point source contamination .",
    "nine clusters were observed at 100 ghz and three at 230 ghz with an average map rms of approximately 0.9 and 4.4 mjy@xmath494 , respectively .",
    "we detect a 7.4 mjy source at 100 ghz in the map of rxcj1504.1 - 0248 .",
    "of the three non - detection clusters observed with carma ( xmmuj2235.3 - 2557 , xmmxcsj2215.9 - 1738 , xmmuj1230.3 + 1339 ) no point sources are detected .",
    "we test for the effects of these bright point sources by excluding the associated clusters from the appropriate subsamples ( five clusters for the m10 sample , and one each for the reflex - dxl and z08 samples ) .",
    "there is no significant difference in the measured scaling relations parameters when removing these potentially contaminated clusters .",
    "the final systematic we investigate is a gas mass fraction that changes as a function of total mass .",
    "there is evidence in both observations @xcite and simulations @xcite that the gas mass fraction changes due to the thermodynamics and feedback processes in the intracluster medium .",
    "as seen in equation [ eqn : scale ] , both the and relation depend on the gas mass fraction .",
    "all of the results presented in table [ tbl : linefit ] assume a constant gas mass fraction embedded in the normalization term .",
    "we test the effect of a non - universal gas mass fraction by first estimating cluster mass using a scaling relation with @xmath2 from @xcite .",
    "we adopt the functional form for gas mass fraction given by the same authors , @xmath495 , where @xmath496 is the total cluster mass @xmath497 in units of @xmath498 .",
    "we then look for the effect of changing @xmath34 on the power law exponent parameter in the measured scaling relations .",
    "when accounting for the non - universal @xmath34 we find a power law exponent of @xmath499 , @xmath500 , and @xmath501 for the reflex - dxl , z08 , and m10 samples , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the results where we assume a constant @xmath34 , and are consistent with self - similarity . in addition , the intrinsic scatter increases from @xmath502 to @xmath503 for the reflex - dxl and m10 samples .",
    "however , the stated uncertainty in the @xmath34 relation is @xmath504 per cent @xcite and our use of @xmath2 combined with the scatter already present in the relation most likely explains the increase .    in summary",
    ", we examine the role of millimeter - wavelength point sources and a non - universal gas mass fraction as astrophysical systematics in the apex - sz scaling relations .",
    "we find no evidence for bias or additional intrinsic scatter due to point sources .",
    "accounting for a non - universal gas mass fraction results in a slight change to the measured power law and increases the intrinsic scatter .",
    "we present sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) observations of galaxy clusters measured with the apex - sz experiment and use them to investigate the scaling of the sze with cluster mass .",
    "we model the thermal pressure of the intracluster medium using the @xcite universal pressure profile and use the results to calculate the spherical integrated comptonization 500 for each cluster .",
    "we compare these measurements of 500 to x - ray estimates of cluster mass taken from the literature . using these two sets of observables",
    ", we measure the , , and scaling relations , finding the best - fit power law and intrinsic scatter for each .",
    "these scaling relations are measured for three subsamples of the 42 apex - sz clusters that have uniform x - ray analysis : the reflex - dxl sample , 15 clusters from z08 , and 19 clusters from m10 .",
    "we find when all 42 clusters with varying x - ray analyses are included , significant systematics are introduced into the power law regression parameters and the intrinsic scatter increases .",
    "for all three subsamples , we find that the best - fit power laws for the , , and relations have exponents consistent with those predicted by the self - similar model .",
    "we compare the measured normalizations for each scaling relation to numerical simulations to probe the underlying astrophysics of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "the measured normalization of the relation for two of the subsamples implies a higher @xmath505 than seen in previous studies .",
    "however , there is a large variation in the normalization between the three samples , despite the uniformly analyzed x - ray data .",
    "therefore , we associate a large systematic uncertainty with the high @xmath505 and do not draw further conclusions from it . we compare the normalization for the and relations to the numerical simulations of @xcite and find a weak preference for models that included radiative cooling and feedback in the icm as well as standard gas dynamics .    finally , we find that the levels of intrinsic scatter for the and relations are consistent with previous measurements .",
    "the uncertainties in the intrinsic scatter are large due to the small number of clusters in the three subsamples .",
    "a larger sample is key to improving this measurement of intrinsic scatter in 500 and its application as an estimator for total cluster mass in cluster - based cosmological constraints .",
    "a uniform x - ray analysis for the full sample of apex - sz clusters is ongoing .",
    "this analysis will resolve the main systematic limitation of the full cluster sample and will allow us to use its large number of clusters to improve on the constraints presented here for the three subsamples .",
    "additionally , a follow - up program of optical observations has been concluded to estimate the total cluster mass independently using weak - lensing measurements .",
    "future papers will use the additional x - ray and weak - lensing information to improve further our understanding of how 500 scales with total cluster mass and facilitate its use in exploring the physics of the icm as well as in constraining cosmological parameters using galaxy clusters .",
