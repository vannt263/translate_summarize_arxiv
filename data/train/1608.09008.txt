    "intermittent pulsars offer a unique opportunity to study the relationship between the spin - down and the emission of radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "these pulsars show normal pulsar emission properties for a period of time ( on phase ) and then switch off and back on again , with cycle times measured in days or even years . while many pulsars exhibit such switching behaviour on timescales of seconds to fractions of a day ( the phenomenon generally known as `` pulse nulling '' )",
    ", the long cycle times present the possibility of determining the rotational slow - down rates in both the on and off states .",
    "only three such objects are known , but they offer a rare opportunity to study the effect of particle flows in pulsar magnetospheres on the spin - down rates , and hence braking torques , of these neutron stars @xcite .",
    "a similar but somewhat - less - dramatic phenomenon is `` mode changing '' , in which switching occurs between two ( or occasionally more ) modes in which the pulse profiles or flux densities are different @xcite , and sometimes in x - rays as well as radio @xcite .",
    "again , the timescales vary from pulsar to pulsar from seconds to years , and furthermore the longest cycle - time objects revealed that the two modes have different slow - down rates @xcite , albeit with much smaller differences . the close similarity of the nulling / intermittent and mode - changing phenomena has led authors to suspect that they are closely related ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dramatic changes in the emission and spin properties have important implications for the present and long - term evolution of these systems and perhaps on the pulsar population as a whole .",
    "there have therefore been a number of mechanisms proposed for both those objects where the radio emission completely switches off and the mode changing sources .",
    "there is a range of models which consider that the plasma supply to the magnetosphere affects the global charge distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or that the plasma is moving at different velocities @xcite .",
    "other proposed mechanisms consider influences closer to the neutron star surface such as changes in the properties of the particle acceleration region @xcite or twists in the magnetic field structure @xcite .",
    "the quasi - periodic nature of the intermittency in some systems has led to the proposal that it may be related to free precession ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or that there may be some sort of forcing mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "others have suggested that it is a chaotic @xcite or markov @xcite process .    because the sporadic nature of intermittent pulsars makes it very difficult to discover them in one - pass surveys , they are also representatives of a much larger underlying population @xcite .",
    "we note that such objects are similar to rotating radio transients ( rrats ) which are often difficult to detect and which also represent a much larger underlying population .",
    "the existance of such hidden populations opens up the possibility that the birthrate of neutron stars may prove to exceed the rate of supernova collapse events and demand the presence of other formation processes .",
    "it is clearly important to increase the number of known intermittent pulsars .    in this paper",
    ", we present the discovery and subsequent study of two extreme long - term intermittent pulsars , psr  j1910 + 0517 and psr  j1929 + 1357 which were found as part of the the ongoing pulsar arecibo l - band feed array ( palfa ) project .",
    "this is a deep pulsar survey of low galactic latitudes being undertaken at the 305-m william e.  gordon telescope at the arecibo observatory .",
    "the survey is described and its parameters are discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    following discovery of the pulsars at arecibo , the 76-m lovell telescope at the jodrell bank observatory , united kingdom , has been used within the palfa collaboration both to confirm the existence of , and to conduct follow - up timing observations of , more than half of the 169 pulsars detected hitherto in the palfa survey .",
    "having confirmed the existence of the two pulsars , because of their potential importance , we have made extensive further observation of these sources with the lovell telescope , in order to study further their emission and timing properties , and we report on these studies in this paper . in  [ sec : obs ] we briefly describe the discovery and follow - up observations and in  [ sec : intermittent ] we discuss in turn the two pulsars which display the extreme long - term intermittency .",
    "we discuss our conclusions in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "since the palfa survey is described thoroughly elsewhere ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) , we give only a brief summary here of the survey observations as described by @xcite .",
    "the survey area covers the two regions close to the galactic plane ( @xmath1 ) which are observable using the arecibo telescope .",
    "these are at galactic longitudes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the survey utilises the seven simultaneous independent dual - polarisation beams provided by the alfa cryogenic receiver .",
    "data were collected for 268s for each telescope pointing from 322-mhz passbands centered on 1375mhz . for the discovery of these two pulsars , the palfa observations used the mock spectrometers to produce 960 frequency channels across the passband of each polarisation channel .",
    "the frequency channels are sampled with 16-bit precision every 65.5  @xmath4s and stored on disk for off - line processing .",
    "the `` quicklook '' pipeline was used to discover both pulsars .",
    "this process analyses the data shortly after it is collected for dispersed periodic signals @xcite .    the confirmation and all subsequent observations of the two pulsars were all carried out with the 76-m lovell telescope at jodrell bank observatory , using a dual - polarization cryogenic receiver which had a cold - sky noise system equivalent flux density of 25 jy .",
    "a digital filterbank was used to receive data in a passband from 1350 mhz to 1700 mhz with 0.5-mhz - bandwidth channels . for each polarisation , the powers from the two channels",
    "were then folded and dedispersed at the nominal period and dispersion measure of the pulsar .",
    "the observations at jodrell bank reported here were mostly made between 2011 november and 2016 january ( mjd  55900 - 57400 ) .",
    "shortly after their discovery , follow - up observations of psrs j1910 + 0517 and j1929 + 1357 indicated that both objects had a bi - modal emission nature and were frequently undetected , suggesting that they suffered extreme long - term intermittency .",
    "the large values of dm for these two pulsars ( 300 and 151 @xmath5pc respectively ) and the bimodal nature of their flux densities indicate that the intermittency is not due to interstellar scintillation .",
    "these pulsars were therefore subjected to intensive monitoring programs using the lovell telescope to investigate these properties .",
    "the results of these observations are discussed below .",
    "psr  j1910 + 0517 was first detected at arecibo in an observation made on 2011 nov 10 ( mjd 55875 ) and was confirmed at jodrell bank later that month , on 2011 on nov 29 ( mjd 55894 ) .",
    "a total of 179 observations were subsequently made of this pulsar up to 2016 jan 13 ( mjd 57400 ) .",
    "the observations had duration of between 20 and 30 minutes and were cleaned of significant radio - frequency interference .",
    "the pulsar was clearly detected 57 times , and undetected on the other 122 occasions .",
    "the distribution of the observed mean pulsed flux density in these observations is summarised in figure [ fig : hists]a , and shows the marked bi - modal nature , with one portion of observations centred on zero , in which pulsed radio emission is undetectable ( the off phase ) . the second , separate and wider distribution is centred on a mean of 0.51  mjy , with standard deviation of 0.13  mjy ( the on phase ) .",
    "however , a careful inspection of the 3-minute subintegrations of each observation reveals that the pulsar clearly switched emission states during 6 of the 179 observations . during the total observation time of 67.1 hr ,",
    "the pulsar was on for 20.1 hours and the duty cycle , the fraction of time spent in the on state , is @xmath6 .",
    "the integrated profiles of all the on observations and all the off observations were formed after alignment using the ephemeris given in table  [ table : intermittent ] and are presented in figure  [ fig : profs]a and [ fig : profs]c .",
    "the half - power width of the pulse of @xmath7=13.0  ms is unremarkable .",
    "inspection of the off emission - mode profile suggests the possibility of some low - level emission at the longitude of the on pulse . this amounts to a fraction of 0.02(1 ) of the on pulse emission : this may be due to either misidentification of some on state subintegrations as being off due to signal - to - noise limitations or to the off emission state not being a pure `` null '' state but one with a small amount of emission .",
    "examples of other pulsars with low - level emission modes are psrs  b0826@xmath834 @xcite and j1853 + 0505 @xcite .",
    "the distributions of the observations and the detections over the  4-yr period are summarised in figures  [ fig:1910_stats]a - c .",
    "it is notable that the number of detections of the pulsar closely tracks the total number of observations made of the source .",
    "this is more directly seen in figure  [ fig:1910_stats]d in which the cumulative number of detections is plotted against the cumulative number of observations .",
    "the local slope in such a diagram represents the duty cycle @xmath9 , the fraction of the time spent in its radio - active phase .",
    "the straight line corresponds to a mean value of @xmath10=0.30(4 ) .",
    "the absence of any systematic deviation of the data from this line suggests that this value is unchanging over the 4-year period .    as indicated above , most of the observations are either on or off for the whole of their 20 - 30-min duration , indicating that the typical timescale between switches of state is substantially greater than this , and it would require a large investment of telescope time to track the switches directly .",
    "however , we can estimate the timescale statistically from the 6 changes of state seen during the 67.1 hours total duration of the 179 observations .",
    "since there are two changes of state for each on / off cycle , the average cycle time is @xmath11=22(9 ) hours .",
    "the average on , or active , time is therefore @xmath12=7(3 ) hours and the average time spent off is @xmath13=15(6 ) hours .",
    "times of arrival ( toas ) were obtained for all the on toas by cross - correlation of the profiles with a standard template and processed using standard analysis techniques with the psrtime and tempo software packages .",
    "a coherent timing fit has been made of a standard slowdown timing model to the toas .",
    "this model included the position , the rotation frequency and its first derivative .",
    "the timing residuals , the difference between the toas and the fitted model , are shown in figure [ fig : resids]a , in which there is clearly significant timing noise .",
    "a satisfactory description of the toas requires a fit for the frequency and its first four derivatives .",
    "the parameters of this fit are summarized in table  [ table : intermittent ] , together with the statistics discussed above .",
    "psr  j1929 + 1357 was first detected at arecibo in an observation made on 2012 sep 20 ( mjd 56190 ) .",
    "the first attempt at confirmation was made at jodrell bank at ut 03:50 on 2013 feb 8 ( mjd 56331 ) , but there was no evidence for any pulsations .",
    "however , the pulsar was clearly seen in a second observation at ut 14:04 on the same day , with a signal - to - noise ratio of 53 in 17 minutes .    however , during the next nine months , up to 2013 nov 05 ( mjd 56601 ) , a total of 656 observations of either 6-min or 12-min duration were made of this pulsar , in which it was detected just 5 times , with signal - to - noise ratios of between 15 and 30 , being undetected on the other 651 occasions . during this period of time , the mean duty cycle was thus @xmath14 , so that the 5 detections required around 100 hours of telescope time .",
    "apart from confirmation of the existence of this pulsar and the determination that the duty cycle was very small , no other astrophysical information was gained during this time .",
    "this was mainly because the sparseness of the detections prevented the establishment of a coherent timing solution .",
    "the use of further telescope time could not be justified and observations were discontinued .    after a break of nearly 15 months ,",
    "observations of the pulsar were restarted at jodrell bank in 2015 january in order to check that there was no change in this behaviour .",
    "indeed , spread over the next six months , a further 90 observations , amounting to 12 hours of telescope time , yielded two more detections , representing a barely significant increase in the duty cycle . however , in august and september of that year , a further 40 observations yielded 7 detections , indicating a significant uplift in the detection rate .",
    "the cadence of observation was increased and by 2016 mid - january ( mjd 57407 ) , a further 47 detections were made from just 317 observations , making a total of 61 detections from 1084 observations .",
    "the distribution of the observed mean pulsed flux density in all these observations is summarised in figure [ fig : hists]b , and shows clearly the bi - modal nature , with one portion of observations centred on 0.002(5 )  mjy and having a standard deviation of 0.15  mjy about the mean .",
    "the second , separate and wider , distribution is centred on a mean of 2.2  mjy , with standard deviation of 0.6  mjy , and represents about 6% of the observations .",
    "this flux density is more than 10 times the median flux density of the 64 long - period pulsars discovered so far in the palfa survey @xcite , making it one of the brightest palfa pulsars .",
    "the integrated profiles of all the on observations and all the off observations were formed and are presented in figure  [ fig : profs]b and [ fig : profs]d .",
    "the half - power width of the pulse of @xmath7=11.5  ms is unremarkable .",
    "the distribution of the observations and the detections over the  3-yr period are summarised in figures  [ fig:1929_stats]a - c .",
    "unlike the case of psr  j1910 + 0517 described above , the rate of detection of this pulsar does not track the rate of observations of the source .",
    "this is more directly seen in figure [ fig:1929_stats]d in which the local value of the slope represents the duty cycle @xmath10 , the fraction of the time spent in its radio - active phase .",
    "the diagonal straight line corresponds to a mean value of @xmath9=0.055(7 ) .",
    "however , the data are well - described by two separate approximately linear sections with a break around mjd  57235 . in 2013 , and for the first 6 months of observation in 2015 ( mjd  56331 - 57235 ) , the mean duty cycle is @xmath10=0.009(4 ) , while , following this ( mjd  57235 - 47408 ) , the mean duty cycle has increased by over an order of magnitude to @xmath10=0.16(2 ) .",
    "most of the observations are either on or off for their whole 6 - 12-min duration , indicating that the typical timescale between switches of state is substantially greater than this , requiring a large investment of telescope time to track the switches directly . however , as with psr  j1910 + 0517 , we can estimate the timescale statistically from the 16 changes of state seen during the 157.3 hours total duration of the 1084 observations . since , on average , there are two changes of state for each cycle , the average cycle time is @xmath15=20(5 ) hours .",
    "the average on , or active , time is @xmath16=1.1(3 ) hours .",
    "repeating these calculations separately for the two sections spanning the break at mjd  57235 , we get @xmath15=220(110 ) and 6.3(1.6 ) hours and @xmath17=2(1 ) and 1.0(3 ) hours respectively .",
    "the increased detection rate towards the end of 2015 has allowed a coherent timing fit to all the toas obtained for psr  j1929 + 1357 since the start of 2013 .",
    "there is clearly significant timing noise and , as can be seen in figure [ fig : resids]b , the data for this pulsar do not fit a simple spin - down model and a satisfactory ephemeris requires a fit for frequency and its first three derivatives .    during recent years , several pulsars",
    "have been shown to display changes in emission properties which are related to their spin - down rate .",
    "the changes in emission seem always to be related to sudden , switched changes between two discrete states . for several pulsars ,",
    "the changes in emission are seen as pulse shape changes @xcite , but for three pulsars , b1931 + 24 @xcite , j1832 + 0029 @xcite and j1841@xmath80500 @xcite , they are seen to switch between emission as normal pulsars ( on ) and emission at levels below the sensitivity of current instrumentation ( off ) . in these three cases ,",
    "the times spent in the two states are measured in weeks or years , long enough for the changes in spin - down rate to be determined during the on phases and hence also deduced for the off phases : if the frequency slow - down rates for the two phases are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then the long - term slow - down rate is expected to be given by : @xmath20 measurement of the long - term value of @xmath21 as well as @xmath18 and @xmath10 thus also allows the determination of @xmath19 : @xmath22    these measurements have been carried out for the three long - term intermittent pulsars mentioned above and are presented in table  [ table : all_intermittent ] .",
    "the values of @xmath18 are always significantly greater in magnitude than @xmath23 , so that their ratio is always more than unity . for one of the pulsars , b1931 + 24 @xcite , and now for j1910 + 0517 (  [ sec : j1910 + 0517 ] ) , the duty cycle @xmath10 is stable over several years .",
    "in the case of psr  j1929 + 1357 , we have a new situation , in which the on - times are much too short for the direct measurement of the spin - down rate in each on phase .",
    "however , for the first time , we have been able to determine a statistical long - term variation in the duty cycle @xmath10 , the fraction of time spent in the on phase , and to measure a corresponding change in slow - down rate .",
    "we note that such an evolution in the statistical properties of the switching of emission mode is similar to that demonstrated in psrs  b1822@xmath809 and b1828@xmath811 @xcite . in those cases , the switching is between states with two different emission profiles and slow - down rates .",
    "the linear fits for the duty cycle given in figure [ fig:1929_stats]d are an approximation to the true form of the variation and we have performed a series of straight - line fits over somewhat shorter time intervals to obtain local values of the duty cycle @xmath10 . over the same timespan of each of these fits , the value of the first rotational frequency derivative @xmath21 is obtained from the fitted ephemeris and the results are presented in figure [ fig:1929_duty_f1 ] .",
    "there is a clear increase in the magnitude of the spin - down rate as the duty cycle of the intermittency increases .",
    "a least - squares fit of equation [ eq : slowdown ] to the data gives values of @xmath24 s@xmath25 and @xmath26 s@xmath25 , so that @xmath27 .",
    "this dependency of the slow - down rate upon the emission state is attributed to variations in the magnetospheric properties of the pulsar , such as changes in plasma currents , which modify both the emission from the magnetosphere and also the rotational torque and hence the rate of loss of angular momentum @xcite . in this pulsar , particles are responsible for increasing the spin - down rate by about 80% , comparable with the values obtained for the other 3 long - term intermittent pulsars presented in table  [ table : all_intermittent ] .",
    "the discovery and statistical study of the long - term intermittent pulsars reported here reveal a large underlying population of such ephemeral objects .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , in single - pass surveys such as the palfa survey , only a fraction @xmath10 of these pulsars will be detected during the survey observations . however , even for those few which are detected , it is difficult to assess the probability that such candidates will be confirmed as pulsars , because confirmation strategies differ between surveys , but usually limit the number of reobservations @xmath28 to a handful because of the pressures on telescope time . as a result , in an extreme case like psr  j1929 + 1357 , the probability of confirming a discovery is @xmath29 , so that the probability of making a confirmed discovery is @xmath30 . in 2013 , with @xmath31 and a reasonable value of @xmath32 , the probability of a making a confirmed discovery of the pulsar was @xmath33 .",
    "we note that , ideally , reobservations should also be made on a specifically designed set of timescales in order to capture pulsars with the wide range of switching timescales that we now see to be possible in this class of object .    in the case of psr  j1929 + 1357 , it was fortunate that the pulsar was on during the 2nd attempted reobservation : in the next 93 observations it was off .",
    "had the first 5 reobservations been unsuccessful , it is possible that even such a strong pulsar would still remain unconfirmed .",
    "similar pulsars , but with one tenth of the flux density must surely exist , and would be clearly detected in the survey observations , particularly with the high sensitivity of the arecibo telescope used for the palfa survey , but the case for extended reobservation efforts would be even less compelling : the unconfirmed detection would be attributed to radio - frequency interference , or a detection of a normal pulsar in a distant sidelobe",
    ".    for these reasons , there may be as many as several thousand more strong pulsars like psr  j1929 + 1357 in the sky , which happen to be off when surveyed , or if on , are off during the confirmation observations .",
    "similar , but less severe , selection effects preventing the discovery of objects like the other long - term intermittent pulsars also contribute to what must be a population of neutron stars which is a significant size compared to normal pulsars . as we noted earlier",
    ", rrats also suffer similar selection effects in one - pass surveys .",
    "it is likely that utmost @xcite and upcoming new projects like chime @xcite and meertrap ( stappers et al .",
    ", in prep ) on meerkat will be useful for finding more such objects as they will make many searches of the same piece of sky on various timescales for single pulse and periodic sources .",
    "the discovery of two new long - term intermittent pulsars , psrs  j1910 + 0517 and j1929 + 1357 , significantly expands the known population of such objects whose properties are summarised in table  [ table : all_intermittent ] .",
    "although their number is still small ( only five such pulsars ) , we are now in a position to make a few general remarks regarding their properties .",
    "they seem to have a rather narrow range of spin periods , from about 0.3 to 0.9 s. furthermore , there seems to be a positive correlation between the spin period and its derivative , as we can see from their on positions in the @xmath34-@xmath35 diagram ( figure  [ fig : ppdot ] ) .",
    "this correlation is similar to that observed for the shorter - term nulling pulsars , although for the same @xmath35 the latter have @xmath36 times larger spin periods .    in both cases , lines of constant",
    "@xmath37 give a rough approximation of the correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with @xmath38 representing a good fit for the intermittent pulsars and @xmath39 being for the short - term nulling pulsars ( although the latter has a few significant outliers ) .",
    "no other quantity ( age , b - field ) appears to give such a good approximation to the corrrelation between @xmath34 and @xmath35 for these objects . however , with such small number statistics , at least for the long - term intermittent pulsars , any conclusions regarding this correlation must be regarded as tentative .",
    "these relations offer new input for the variety of theoretical models to explain their behaviour , however , more discoveries of intermittent pulsars are necessary for confirming ( or refuting ) this conclusion",
    ".    conventional understanding of this diagram is that pulsars are formed in the upper left and move down and across to the right . because of the logarithmic form of the diagram , if pulsars maintain their brightness throughout their lives , their density in this diagram should increase by a factor of 10 every semi - decade of period .",
    "clearly this is not happening and the density peaks at around 0.5 sec and then falls rapidly .",
    "the flux density , and hence luminosity of pulsars must fall to take them below the sensitivity of our surveys .",
    "this decrease may be continuous , as the rotation rate decreases and the electrodynamic particle acceleration processes in the pulsar magnetosphere reduce , or it is possible that it occurs in a stuttering manner as the pulsar starts nulling , and an increases in nulling fraction eventually brings it permanently to the off state .",
    "the presence of these nulling / intermittent pulsars in this unexpectedly sparse region of the diagram suggests that the latter may be occurring as the rate of loss of kinetic energy @xmath37 reduces .",
    "what is not clear is why the long - term intermittent pulsars lie at higher values of @xmath37 than the shorter - term nulling pulsars .",

    "<S> psrs j1910 + 0517 and j1929 + 1357 show long - term extreme bi - modal intermittency , switching between active ( on ) and inactive ( off ) emission states and indicating the presence of a large , hitherto unrecognised , underlying population of such objects . for psr  j1929 </S>",

    "<S> this is the first time that a significant evolution in the activity of an intermittent pulsar has been seen and we show that the spin - down rate of the pulsar is proportional to the activity . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - down rate of psr  j1929 + 1357 is increased by a factor of 1.8 when it is in active mode , similar to the increase seen in the other three known long - term intermittent pulsars .    </S>",
