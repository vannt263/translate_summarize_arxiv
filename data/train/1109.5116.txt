    "also , when the known radio magnetars are observed to be `` on '' , their luminosities are variable by a factor of a few ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , a magnetar may not be detected at radio frequencies because its radio beam does not intersect the earth .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to estimate the fraction of the celestial sphere illuminated by any given pulsar without knowing the geometry involved .",
    "the x - ray pulse profiles of magnetars are typically broad @xcite , thus their x - ray beaming fractions are likely quite large .",
    "therefore , it is unreasonable to make assumptions concerning the geometries of known magnetars based on their x - ray detections .",
    "instead , naively assuming that the radio beaming properties of magnetars are similar to those of rotation - powered radio pulsars , we use empirical results for the beaming fraction of radio pulsars to attempt to constrain that of magnetars @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate the fraction of pulsars , @xmath71 , beamed towards the earth as a function of spin period , @xmath72 , to be    @xmath73 ^ 2 + 0.03.\\ ] ]    given that there are three known radio - loud magnetars out of a total of 13 sources observed ( this work ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it is possible to estimate the probability that at least one of the undetected sources is beamed towards the earth .",
    "using a representative period of 7  s , equation [ eq : beamingfrac ] can be used to compute the probability that 4 or more magnetars are beamed towards the earth ( that is , at least one of the undetected magnetars is beamed towards us ) .",
    "we find @xmath74 .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that if we had detected one of our targets , equation [ eq : beamingfrac ] would be inconsistent with the magnetar data at the 3.2 @xmath49 level .",
    "thus the non - detections reported here are consistent with being due to unfortunate beaming , assuming gaussian statistics and that equation [ eq : beamingfrac ] applies .    however , if we assume equation [ eq : beamingfrac ] applies , and again consider representative period of 7 s , we find the probability of three or more magnetars being beamed towards us is @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , which is suggestive that radio - magnetars have wider beams than rotation - powered pulsars with similar periods .",
    "in fact , by recasting equation [ eq : beamingfrac ] in terms of the pulsar beam s half - opening angle , @xmath77 , we find that @xmath78 is required for three out of 13 sources to be beamed towards us to be consistent with random orientations at the 3@xmath49 level .",
    "this value of @xmath77 is @xmath79 times larger than what is used by @xcite , @xmath80 , for @xmath72 = 7  s , and is much more accommodating of the large duty cycles of the radio profiles of 1e  1547.0@xmath75408 and psr  j1622@xmath74950 ( 14% and @xmath7011% , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggested difference in @xmath77 for magnetically powered and rotationally powered pulsars further reinforces the likely different origin of the radio emission in these objects .",
    "using the gbt s pulsar spigot , five magnetars and two magnetar candidates were observed at 1950 mhz over the course of @xmath70 1 year .",
    "the data were searched for pulsed periodic emission , as well as bright single pulses .",
    "none of the targets observed were detected .",
    "the non - detections were used to place stringent constraints on the presence of any radio emission at the observing epochs .",
    "none of the seven targets observed showed periodic emission with luminosity larger than 1.6 mjy kpc@xmath1 , or single pulse emission with luminosity larger than 7.6 jy kpc@xmath1 at 1950 mhz in any of the data sets .",
    "it is difficult to use the upper limits derived from this work to constrain the physical properties of the sources , since previous results suggest radio emission from magnetars is highly variable .",
    "it is possible that observations were merely scheduled , by chance , at times when the magnetars radio emission was too faint to be detected . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible that the non - detections are nothing more than unfortunate beaming geometries .",
    "however , this work and previous work have combined to detect three out of 13 magnetars observed at radio frequencies .",
    "this suggests that the radio beaming fraction of magnetars is larger than that of rotation - powered pulsars with similar periods , in agreement with lines of reasoning .    finally ,",
    "if any of the sources studied here becomes visible at radio frequencies in the future , our results will be invaluable for providing a baseline with which detections can be compared .",
    "this may help us understand what magnetospheric conditions are required to produce radio emission , and the details of plasmas and currents in magnetar magnetospheres .",
    "what is learned from magnetars could also likely help elucidate the radio emission mechanism for pulsars in general .",
    "for this reason , the known magnetars should continue to be observed at radio frequencies .",
