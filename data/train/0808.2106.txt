    "<S> diffraction measurements performed via transmission electron microscopy and high resolution x - ray scattering reveal two distinct charge density wave transitions in gd@xmath0te@xmath1 at @xmath2 = 410(3 ) and @xmath3 = 532(3 ) k , associated with the _ on_-axis incommensurate lattice modulation and _ off_-axis commensurate lattice modulation respectively . </S>",
