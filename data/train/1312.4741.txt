    "it has been found that the charged hadron multiplicities at central rapidity are significantly smaller than saturation based calculations and are compatible to those obtained on a study of multiplicities in the fragmentation region with running coupling corrections @xcite .",
    "finally , fluctuations have been investigated in @xmath1 collisions at lep and future @xmath2 colliders @xcite and it has been found that although observing the presence of the fluctuation effects can be a hard task , they should not be disregarded in the description of some observables in future colliders .",
    "although fluctuations have been discarded by toy models which reproduce some of the main features of high energy evolution and scattering in qcd @xcite , in particular when running coupling corrections are included , it still lacks a similar treatment in real qcd .",

    "in the mean field approximation , this infinite set of coupled equations reduces to a single one , the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite , a closed equation for the one - dipole scattering amplitude @xmath51 , which , at fixed coupling , is given by @xmath52,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 . in the translation invariance approximation ,",
    "the amplitude is independent of the impact parameter @xmath48 and depends only on the dipole size @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 . for small values of @xmath56 , the bk solution @xmath57 is small  the color transparency regime  and the linear solution is enough to describe the dipole evolution . for large @xmath56 ,",
    "the amplitude approaches the unitarity bound , or black disk limit @xmath58 .",
    "the transition between these two regimes takes place at @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is an increasing function of rapidity @xmath49 and is called the _ saturation scale _ ,",

    "the bk equation admits travelling wave solutions @xcite : at asymptotic rapidities , the scattering amplitude depends only on the ratio @xmath62 instead of depending separately on @xmath56 and @xmath49 .",
    "this scaling property is called geometric scaling and has been observed in the measurements of the proton structure function at hera @xcite .",
    "the amplitude is a wavefront which interpolates between 0 and 1 and travels towards smaller values of @xmath63 with speed @xmath64  the saturation exponent  keeping its shape , and the saturation scale @xmath60 gives the front position .    besides the theoretical explanation of geometric scaling in terms of travelling wave solutions of bk equation",
    ", the correspondence between qcd evolution at high energy and reaction - diffusion processes has also brought to light the fact that the balitsky - jimwlk hierarchy misses important effects , those due to gluon ( dipole ) number fluctuations , which are related to discreteness in the evolution @xcite . at least at fixed coupling @xcite , fluctuations influence dramatically the qcd evolution at high energies and , when they are included , a new hierarchy of evolution equations arise , the _ pomeron loop _",
    "equations @xcite .",
    "these are rather complicated to solve , so some approximations are needed to get some knowledge about the dipole scattering amplitudes .",
    "after such approximations @xcite , the new hierarchy has been found to can be generated from a langevin equation for the single - event amplitude , which formally is the bk equation with a noise term , which lies in the same universality class of the stochastic fkpp equation ( sfkpp ) : each realization of the noise means a single realization of the target in the evolution and leads to an amplitude for a single event .",
    "different realizations of the target lead to a dispersion of the solutions , and then in the saturation momentum @xmath65 from one event to another .",
    "the saturation scale is now a random variable whose average value is given by @xmath66}\\ ] ] and the dispersion in the position of the individual fronts is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the _ diffusion coefficient _ , a number expected to be of order one , which determines the rapidity @xmath69 above which gluon number fluctuations become important .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath70 is , to a good approximation , a gaussian @xcite @xmath71.\\ ] ] the travelling - wave behavior is kept by the evolved single event amplitude , that is , geometric scaling is preserved for each realization of the noise ( correspondingly , each realization of the target configuration at rapidity @xmath49 ) . however , the speed @xmath72 of the wave is smaller than that predicted by bk equation .",
    "the physical ( average over all the configurations of the target ) amplitude is obtained through ( @xmath73 ) @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the event - by - event scattering amplitude .",
    "now , at sufficiently high energies , unlike the individual fronts , the amplitudes will generally not show geometric scaling , but will show additional dependencies upon @xmath49 , through the front dispersion @xmath76 . as a consequence ,",
    "geometric scaling is washed out and replaced by the so - called _ diffusive scaling _",
    "@xcite @xmath77 that is , at asymptotic rapidities , the average amplitude will depend on the diffusive scaling variable @xmath78 .",
    "the search for evidences of the gluon number fluctuation effects has motivated the analysis performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which have looked for any signal of the diffusive scaling in the kinematical region probed by hera .",
    "the results of these studies indicate no evidence of fluctuation effects .",
    "however , recent theoretical developments @xcite indicate that , at least at fixed coupling ( and at the level of single pomeron loop ) , fluctuations should be taken into account at the energies probed by the future electron - hadron colliders .",
    "this motivates us to extend the previous studies to the kinematical range which could be probed in these colliders @xcite and estimate , for the first time , the magnitude of the fluctuation effects for the small-@xmath4 behavior of the nuclear structure functions . in what follows we estimate the observables considering as input in the calculations models for the physical scattering amplitude @xmath79 and compare our predictions with those obtained using the event - by - event scattering amplitude @xmath80 , i.e. disregarding the fluctuaction effects",
    "let us begin our analysis discussing @xmath0 collisions , which could be studied in the future lhec collider .",

    "we assume the translational invariance approximation , which regards hadron homogeneity in the transverse plane , which implies that the dipole - proton cross section and the forward dipole scattering amplitude are related by a constant @xmath85 , which results from the @xmath48 integration and sets the normalization . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors found that the description of the dis data is improved once gluon number fluctuations are included and that the values of the saturation exponent and the diffusion coefficient turn out reasonable and agree with values obtained from numerical simulations of toy models which take into account fluctuations .",

    "<S> our results indicate that the study of these observables in the future colliders can be useful to constrain the presence of gluon number fluctuations . </S>"
