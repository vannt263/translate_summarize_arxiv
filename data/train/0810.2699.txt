    "empirical models based on the heisenberg spin hamiltonian are routinely utilized to describe the behavior of a variety of magnetic systems . in most cases ,",
    "these simple models are found to fit the experimental data very well , provided that the parameters in the model hamiltonian are chosen properly .",
    "the set of parameters can include both , external parameters ( temperature , applied magnetic field , etc . ) , and internal parameters ( magnetic exchange couplings , magnetic anisotropy , etc . ) .",
    "internal parameters for a particular system can be obtained either by fitting experimental data or from first - principles electronic structure calculations by mapping total electronic energies to the energies of the heisenberg spin hamiltonian.@xcite in particular , magnetic exchange couplings , @xmath0 , can be obtained considering the isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the ( localized ) spin operators associated to each magnetic center .",
    "perhaps the one of the most interesting manifestation of magnetism at the molecular scale can be found in complexes containing transition metal atoms .",
    "many applications have been suggested exploiting these molecular - size magnets , such as quantum computation units and high - density data storage.@xcite due to the relatively large size of most complexes of interest , density functional theory ( dft)@xcite offers the most efficient alternative for modeling the electronic structure of these systems from first - principles.@xcite    several approaches had been proposed to extract @xmath0 couplings from dft energies . according to the spin - projected ( sp ) approach,@xcite the energies of a two - center complex @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "can be related to the @xmath0 coupling as @xmath6 while in the non - projected ( np ) approach@xcite , the energies of a two - center complex @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be related to the @xmath0 coupling as @xmath9 where @xmath10 . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sp ] ) and ( [ eq : np ] ) , @xmath11 is the energy of the high - spin state and @xmath12 is the energy of the low - spin ( broken - symmetry ) state .",
    "( [ eq : sp ] ) and ( [ eq : np ] ) can be straightforwardly generalized to a set of equations for complexes with multiple magnetic centers.@xcite while the sp and np methods are fairly popular , other methods have been proposed in the literature such as nishino s approach@xcite , the constrained - dft approach of rudra et al.,@xcite , the slater s transition state method of dai and whangbo.@xcite and the local spin method of clark and davidson.@xcite all these approaches rely on the evaluation of the energy difference between two ( for the simplest case of a bimetallic complex ) or more states .",
    "the evaluation of this energy difference is commonly done by carrying out several self - consistent field calculations , one for each different magnetic configuration . however , in many cases , converging to the right target state could be cumbersome , specially for systems containing multiple centers with many magnetic configurations . therefore , developing an approach that can be used in a `` black - box '' manner is crucial to systematically explore a large set of complexes or complexes containing many magnetic centers .",
    "in this work , we present an approach for the evaluation of magnetic exchange couplings based on noncollinear spin density functional calculations that allows , in analogy to response properties , to express the magnetic exchange couplings as a derivative of the total electronic energy of one single state with respect to an external parameter , opening the possibility of `` black - boxifying '' the extraction of magnetic exchange couplings from density functional theory calculations .",
    "let us consider the effective interaction energy between two magnetic centers @xmath4 and @xmath5 given by the isotropic classical heisenberg model ( obtained by taking the expectation value of eq .",
    "( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) ) , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the ( perfectly localized ) magnetic moment vectors , @xmath16 is the exchange coupling constant , and @xmath17 is the angle between @xmath14 and @xmath15 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : heis - cosine ] ) , one can trivially obtain @xmath16 from the second derivative of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath17 at the equilibrium points , @xmath19 these simple relations provide a direct path to the evaluation of magnetic exchange couplings @xmath16 from density functional calculations if @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heis - deriv ] ) is replaced by the total kohn - sham ( ks)@xcite energy of the system , @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , assuming that the electronic system depends on @xmath17 as an ideal heisenberg model ( the validity of this assumption will be discussed in the next section ) , one can express the exchange coupling constant @xmath16 in terms of an energy derivative as @xmath21 or @xmath22 where the angle @xmath17 in the dft framework is defined as the angle between the local magnetization vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "another related method based on the green s function formalism for crystals has been proposed by liechtenstein et al.@xcite      to evaluate the dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath17 , we first introduce two - component spinors as kohn - sham orbitals , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are spatial orbitals expanded in a linear combination of atomic orbitals , @xmath26 the two - component spinors introduce the freedom in the spin - dependence of the ks system that allows for local rotations of the spin density characterized by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , i.e. noncollinear spin densities.@xcite the local magnetization vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the spin - density vector and @xmath31 is a scalar weight function that determines each local magnetic site .",
    "it is important to recall that the magnetic centers @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent a group of one or more atoms . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin ] ) , @xmath32 is the @xmath33 pauli matrices vector .",
    "it is important to note that since the constraint conditions are linear in the spin density vectors , the additional terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ks ] ) depend implicitly on the orbitals only through @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which simplifies the implementation .        neglecting spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "@xmath51 , @xmath47 , and @xmath0 are diagonal in the @xmath52 spin space , and thus the only term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ks ] ) that couples @xmath53 and @xmath54 is @xmath48 . in a previous work ,",
    "we have generalized @xmath48 for noncollinear magnetizations,@xcite assuming that the xc energy depends on the local variables in the same manner as in the standard collinear ( spin - unrestricted ) case , and imposing the condition for the xc energy to be invariant under rigid rotations of the spin density . in that work ,",
    "we have derived @xmath48 for general energy functionals containing a variety of ingredients beyond the local - spin density approximation ( lsda ) and the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) , such as meta - ggas and hybrid density functionals .",
    "this same generalization is adopted throughout this work .",
    "other implementations based on plane - waves@xcite and gaussian - type orbitals can be found in the literature for a variety of applications.@xcite    the constraint vectors can be chosen without loss of generality to lay in the @xmath55 plane . hence , as spin - orbit interaction is not included in the hamiltonian , the two - component spinors are purely real . as a consequence , in this scheme",
    "the orbital magnetization of the solutions is always zero .    the value of @xmath34 at the stationary solutions for a fixed @xmath17 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stat1])([eq : stat3 ] ) can be directly associated to the energy of the ks system in the presence of the constraints , @xmath56 .",
    "the only arbitrariness in the formulation is the choice of the weight function @xmath31 and the fragments @xmath4 and @xmath5 . since in practice",
    "it is necessary to evaluate the matrix elements of @xmath31 in the atomic orbitals basis set @xmath57 , it is convenient to define @xmath14 and @xmath15 using population analysis , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the spin - density matrix vector whose cartesian components are @xmath60 and @xmath61 written in terms of the @xmath52 density matrix @xmath62 for this work , we employ lwdin population analysis.@xcite from the expression for the atomic spin - population given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - pop ] ) , @xmath63 can be obtained as @xmath64 thus , using the lwdin partitioning , it is straightforward to show that the matrix elements of @xmath31 can be calculated from the atomic orbitals overlap matrix @xmath65 as @xmath66 it is worth commenting that atomic spin - densities are less sensitive to the choice of the population method than atomic densities.@xcite since only the direction of the atomic spin - density is relevant in our method for the calculation of magnetic exchange couplings , we expect even less sensitivity with the coice of the population method .",
    "the set of spinors that simultaneously satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : ks ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stat1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stat2 ] ) needs to be determined self - consistently since @xmath0 and @xmath48 depend on the spinors . to obtain the ks hamiltonian , we add the additional constraint terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ks ] ) to the standard ks hamiltonian , initially using a guess for the lagrange multipliers @xmath67 and @xmath50",
    ". then we determine the optimal @xmath67 and @xmath50 such that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stat1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stat2 ] ) are satisfied , using the density matrix obtained from diagonalizing the ks hamiltonian of the constraint system to evaluate @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this is carried out using the steepest descent method to find the minimum of @xmath34 as a function of @xmath67 and @xmath50 .",
    "once the optimal values of the lagrange multipliers are determined , and provided that self - consistency is not achieved , we proceed to the next self - consistent iteration using the density matrix from the previous iteration .",
    "the process stops once the criteria for changes in the density matrix and total energy are met .",
    "several consistency checks were performed to verify the robustness of our code .",
    "we have implemented this scheme in the gaussian development version program.@xcite    using this methodology , @xmath56 was calculated for small values of @xmath17 around @xmath68 and @xmath69 and magnetic exchange couplings were obtained from the quadratic coefficient of a polynomial fit .",
    "it is important at this point to mention that there are cases where existing approximate density functional methods have difficulties in representing the ls state ( @xmath69).@xcite the kohn - sham determinant in these cases correspond to a `` broken - symmetry '' solution that mixes two or more eigenfunctions of the @xmath70 operator .",
    "however , for the hs state ( @xmath68 ) , it is customary accepted that approximate density functionals provide a reliable representation .",
    "thus , even though for comparison purposes in the next section we show our results using both the hs and ls states as reference , for the practical extraction of magnetic exchange couplings in the dft framework , this method is expected to work more reliably using only the hs as the reference state .",
    "we first tested our methodology in the h  he  h linear model system with a distance h  he of 1.625 , considering the outer h atoms as magnetic centers @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath71 ) . in table",
    "[ table : hheh ] we show our results for the magnetic exchange couplings calculated from @xmath72 using the @xmath68 ( @xmath73 ) state and the @xmath69 ( @xmath74 ) state , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "all calculations were carried out with the 6 - 311 g * * gaussian basis set.@xcite for comparison , in table  [ table : hheh ] we include results for the lsda ( dirac exchange plus the parametrization of wosko , wilk , and nusair@xcite for correlation ) , the blyp realization of the gga ( becke s 1988 functional@xcite for exchange and the correlation functional of lee , yang , and parr@xcite ) , and for the b3lyp@xcite hybrid functional . for all functionals ,",
    "exchange couplings calculated from the energy derivatives , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , are in very close agreement to the exchange coupling calculated from the energy difference , @xmath77 .",
    "the difference can be attributed to both , the intrinsic accuracy of the numerical differentiation method and to the fact that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are expected to be identical to @xmath77 only in the case where dft describes the electronic system as an ideal heisenberg model .",
    "the small discrepancy between @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be understood in terms of the localized nature of the magnetization on the h atoms in this model system and provides a measure of how well the electronic system mimics the behavior of an ideal heisenberg model .    in table",
    "[ table : hheh ] we report @xmath77 as calculated from the sp formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sp ] ) , since it offers a direct comparison between @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the ideal case of a perfect heisenberg system , @xmath78 is related to @xmath75 and @xmath76 according to @xmath79 therefore , @xmath80 provides a measure of @xmath81 that can be evaluated without explicitly converging the self - consistent procedure to the ls state .    .",
    "magnetic exchange couplings ( in mev ) calculated from energy derivatives and from energy differences for the h  he  h system .",
    "[ table : hheh ] [ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]     a careful comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : full - lsda ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : full - b3lyp ] evidences a larger deviation from the ideal cosine function for lsda than for b3lyp .",
    "the largest differences from the cosine function are approximately 0.6  mev and 0.04  mev for lsda and b3lyp , respectively , and occurs for @xmath82 in both cases .",
    "this is not surprising since lsda yields electron ( total and spin ) densities more delocalized than b3lyp ( the lwdin atomic magnetic moments at the v atoms for the ls state are 1.00  @xmath83 and 1.10  @xmath83 for lsda and b3lyp , respectively ) and therefore , one can expect that the b3lyp energy follows the heisenberg behavior more closely than its lsda counterpart .",
    "localization of the spin - density also reduces the calculated magnetic exchange couplings , as shown by martin@xcite , ruiz@xcite , and demonstrated by rudra et at . by explicitly constraining the local magnetization of the ls state.@xcite as shown in table  [ table : j - v2 ] ,",
    "the difference between @xmath84 and @xmath76 is 4.7  mev for lsda , while it is only 0.2  mev for b3lyp .",
    "thus , in contrast to the perfectly localized case , a more delocalized magnetization yields to larger deviations from the ideal heisenberg behavior and hence greater differences between @xmath84 and @xmath76 and at the same time to larger exchange couplings .",
