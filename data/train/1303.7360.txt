    "since the @xmath3 was discovered in 1964  @xcite , there has been considerable interest in its decay both theoretically and experimentally because of its special role in low energy scale quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) theory .",
    "its main decay modes , including hadronic and radiative decays , have been well measured  @xcite , but the study of @xmath8 anomalous decays is still an open field .",
    "recently , using the radiative decay @xmath9 via @xmath10 as the source of @xmath8 mesons , cleo  @xcite reported the first observation of the conversion decay @xmath11 , which has been discussed for many years based on the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model and chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "theoretically this decay is expected to proceed via a virtual photon intermediate state , @xmath12 , and provides a more stringent test of the theories since it involves off - shell photons . in accordance with theoretical predictions ,",
