    "this probability becomes negligible for semiclassical barriers when @xmath1 and a classical under - barrier action @xmath2 is big . in two - dimensions the most convenient way to calculate the exponent @xmath3 is by the use of a classical trajectory @xmath4 , @xmath5 in imaginary time @xmath6 [ @xcite ] .",
    "the trajectory goes in a classically forbidden area ( under the barrier ) and connects two classically allowed regions .",
    "the classical action , constructed by means of this trajectory , is called euclidean action and determines wkb - type exponent @xmath3 . the method of classical trajectories is relatively simple since it allows to determine the tunneling probability in the main ( no pre - exponent ) approximation @xmath7 just only solving newton s equation of motion .",

    "the cyclotron frequency is @xmath9 and tunneling occurs in the @xmath10-direction .",
    "if the tunnel barrier is not a constant , containing weak impurity centers , @xmath11 becomes spatially dependent resulting in a variable gauge potential of a sawtooth shape ( parabolic segments ) instead of pure parabolic one .",
    "this potential is `` pinned '' by impurities , separated by the characteristic distance @xmath12 , and repeats their positions [ @xcite ] . in the regime of a strong magnetic field , when the energy @xmath13 exceeds a height of the tunnel barrier , an electron tunnels incoherently through each peak of the gauge potential . for this incoherent motion",
    "the total probability of tunneling is a product of partial ones .",
    "this process can be elegantly described in terms of classical trajectories in imaginary time [ @xcite ] . in this formalism",
    "the coordinate @xmath4 remains real but @xmath14 becomes imaginary . for the strong magnetic field",
    "a kinetic energy is not important and one can consider a massless limit .",
    "when the magnetic field is not strong , kinetic energy enters the game and a scenario of tunneling can be dramatically different .",
    "below we consider a static two - dimensional tunnel potential which , in the barrier region , is only @xmath15-dependent , tunneling occurs in the @xmath10-direction , and the static magnetic field is directed along the @xmath16-axis . as in refs .",
    "[ @xcite ] , we use a method of classical trajectories to find a tunneling probability .    as shown in the paper , when the magnetic field is close to a certain value @xmath17 the probability of tunneling @xmath0 through a long barrier",

    "this process can be called long distance tunneling .",
    "it strongly contrasts to wkb - like tunneling which is associated solely with an exponential decay inside a barrier .    in general , a phenomenon , when @xmath18 at some value of a parameter , is referred to as euclidean resonance .",

    "it occurs at @xmath19 and it is a reason of the above mentioned long distance tunneling .    a schematic interpretation of long distance tunneling is associated with formation of a variable gauge potential , as for a barrier with impurities [ @xcite ] . in our case",
    "there are no impurities and the variable gauge potential is formed due to an intrinsic mechanism .",
    "it is periodic in the direction of tunneling .",

    "tunneling processes through subsequent periodic barriers are strongly coherent and there is no exponential decay of a moving wave packet [ @xcite ] .",
    "one can say that the magnetic field sets a long distance under - barrier coherence .",
    "the goal of this paper is not to investigate long distance tunneling in details but rather to establish the phenomenon .",

    "a phenomenon when in a tunneling probability @xmath0 the quantity @xmath3 tends to zero at some value of a parameter is referred to as euclidean resonance .",
    "a phenomenon of euclidean resonance is associated with formation of an extended quantum coherence under a barrier which substantially differs from a wkb - like decaying wave function .",
    "this phenomenon was studied initially for tunneling through nonstationary barriers .",
    "as follows from the paper , it can also occur inside a static potential barrier in a static magnetic field . in this case",
    "@xmath3 tends to zero at the certain magnetic field @xmath17 . at a vicinity of @xmath17",
    "the tunneling probability rapidly grows up and can reach a value which is not exponentially small .",
    "this allows tunneling over the distance which is bigger by the factor @xmath190 compared to a conventional wkb - like one .",
    "euclidean resonance is a reason of long distance tunneling .    in this paper classical trajectories",
    "are used to study tunneling through a potential barrier in a magnetic field .",
    "this wide distributed method is relatively simple and allows to calculate a tunneling probability with the exponential accuracy ( no pre - exponential factor ) .",
    "the method of trajectories works as soon as a classical action exceeds planck s constant .",
    "hence , one can approach the resonance value @xmath17 of the magnetic field until @xmath7 is small .",
    "the method also enables ( by an analytical continuation into complex plane ) to select forms of those potential barriers which result in long distance tunneling .",
    "this reminds a calculation of an integral of a strongly oscillating function when a deformation of an integration contour toward complex plane leads to a simple evaluation of the integral . in other words",
    ", a delicate quantum interference can be effectively formulated in terms of complex trajectories .",
    "complex trajectories for tunneling in a strong magnetic field ( @xmath135 ) were explored in refs .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "the method of trajectories used allows to calculate the tunneling probability solely at certain discrete values of the magnetic field .",
    "a goal of this paper is not to perform a comprehensive investigation of long distance tunneling but just to establish this phenomenon .",
    "for this reason , we consider a mostly convenient potential barrier related to quantum wires .",
    "one of the next steps in the field is a numerical calculation of the quantum problem .",
    "a numerical calculations would provide a whole magnetic field dependence of the tunneling probability and a structure of the wave function in two dimensions .",
    "a numerical calculation constitutes a separate problem .",
    "an interpretation of long distance tunneling is based on formation of a periodic variable gauge potential under the barrier . a particle moves in this periodic potential like in a conventional periodic structure with a narrow energy band when subsequent tunneling processes through potential barriers are very coherent .",
    "this contrasts with tunneling through a barrier with impurities [ @xcite ] where tunneling processes across subsequent barriers ( formed by a variable gauge potential which is `` pinned '' by impurities ) are not coherent .",
    "tunneling between quantum wires with physical parameters chosen above can occur if they are separated even by 3000@xmath191 . from the stand point of conventional wkb tunneling",
    "such a big separation distance relates to an almost classical potential barrier with a tunneling probability of @xmath170 .",
    "the limit 3000@xmath191 is set by dissipation . for a bigger inter - wire distance",
    "the dissipation affects the coherence but does not destroy it completely . the case of a bigger inter - wire distance",
    "requires a special consideration .    besides particular applications ( for example , tunneling between quantum wires ) ,",
    "a phenomenon of long distance tunneling may be of a more general interest since it strongly contrasts to the known scenario of quantum tunneling .",
    "being based on a phenomenon of euclidean resonance , long distance tunneling can be caused by a various types of external perturbations .",
    "it can be an applied magnetic field , nonstationary electric field , and a coulomb field of charged particles in nuclear processes .",
    "as preliminary calculations show , a certain static perturbation of a barrier also can result in euclidean resonance and , therefore , in long distance tunneling .",
    "it seems to be interesting to study a possibility of a long distance coherence in various quantum systems ( big size molecules , wide separated artificial quantum wells , etc . ) .",
    "the nature allows , in principle , a long distance motion under an almost classical static potential barrier which strongly contrasts to wkb - like tunneling .",
    "an example of this motion , similar to tunneling between quantum wires in a magnetic field , is considered in the paper . at moderate dissipation",
    ", a particle can tunnel through a long potential barrier as through a conventional narrow band periodic structure .",
    "the magnetic field sets a long distance coherence under a barrier .",
    "this phenomenon relates to euclidean resonance ."
