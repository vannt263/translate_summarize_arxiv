    "quantum physicists has always known that a non - dissipating physical system can always be given by a hermitian hamiltonian which has all the ingredients of reality of eigenvalues ( as they represent energy ) and norm preserving time evolutions ( as no particle or energy exchange is happening ) . in 1998",
    "bender et .",
    "al , @xcite studied eigenvalues of non - hermitian hamiltonian , numerically .",
    "they found to their surprise that these hamiltonians had a spectrum of real eigenvalues in a certain parameter range .",
    "moreover , these hamiltonians were pt ( parity , time reversal)-symmetric .",
    "however , the state space of such a system was not complete orthogonal ( hence , it could nt form a hilbert space ) , as it is needed to represent a non dissipative quantum physical system ( which was until now always represented by hermitian hamiltonians ) .",
    "several attempts were made by people to solve this difficulty,@xcite .",
    "it was however shown by , mostafazadeh,@xcite that rather than focussing on pt - symmetry one should focus on the non - hermitian property of these hamiltonians , and he provided a general framework which showed that all non - hermitian hamiltonians in the real eigenvalue regime will show an exact behavior like systems represented by hermitian hamiltonians , by changing the metric of state space of these hamiltonians . however , in the complex eigenvalue regime it can be seen that the system does not have norm preserving time evolutions even after changing metric and has complex eigenvalues , which is interpreted as onset of dissipation in this paper and , @xcite and many others . now , the use of non - hermitian mathematical framework has been considered by , @xcite where they have used it in classical optics by taking two waveguides , one of it loosing and other gaining , but overall the system is non - dissipating . they have specifically taken up the idea of symmetry breaking of non - hermitian systems , and used it in optical waveguide theory .",
    "we in this paper follow that the formalism of pseudo - hermiticity can be used to describe non - dissipating regime of a system whose dissipating nature depends on certain parameters , @xcite and it has been verified in the experiment that by going above certain threshold given by this theory ( which , @xcite called optical gain / loss coefficient ) , a non - hermitian system starts dissipating .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows , section 1,2,3,4,5 gives necessary and sufficient proofs for establishing the iso - spectrality between a pseudo - hermitian system and a hermitian hamiltonian system and addresses important subtleties creating confusion regarding this theory .",
    "section 6 establishes the theory of measurement in these systems and section 7,8 describes non - composite pseduo - hermitian systems in density operator language .",
    "section 8,9,10,11 describe composite systems involving pseudo - hermitian systems and establish important quantum measures and clarifications to .@xcite    we will first of all clarify certain ideas related to this field and direct to appendix for particular examples of the framework .",
    "there are certain ideas which need to be clarified using  geometry of projection of state space of a 2@xmath212 non - hermitian quantum system with real eigenvalues , which we have provided in appendix .",
    "also , hence forward we will designate non - dissipating systems in real eigenvalue regime as pseudo - hermitian .",
    "here we give minimal amount of proofs needed to establish this theory consistently .",
    "we start by asking what is the relationship between eigenvalues of non - hermitian matrix and its hermitian conjugate .",
    "consider an operator @xmath14 and @xmath5 s.t ( such that ) @xmath22 and they obey an eigenvalue problem , then the eigenvalues of @xmath14 and @xmath5 , denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively are related as @xmath23 ( where * denotes complex conjugation ) .      we know from given information that , @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath18 and @xmath20 are eigenvectors of h and @xmath5 respectively i.e @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath27 and @xmath29are vector spaces with inner product @xmath30.now , taking conjugate transpose of ( 1)and then multiplying ( 1 ) by @xmath31 from right we have @xmath32 using ( 2 ) we see that @xmath33 hence we can see that canceling @xmath34 that @xmath35 hence we can see that when eigenvalues are real they are equal @xmath36 + we know that matrices with same eigenvalues are similar @xcite , i.e. they are related by similarity transformation",
    ". we now check what will be the similar transformation between these non - hermitian matrices in real eigenvalue regime .      in the real eigenvalue regime of h ,",
    "h and @xmath5 are related by @xmath0h@xmath37=@xmath5 ; s.t .",
    "@xmath38 where n is the dimension of h , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "note : @xmath27 and @xmath29 are just state space of @xmath14 and @xmath5 and they are not yet rendered into hilbert space .",
    "we know @xmath41=@xmath42 now conjugate transposing we get @xmath43 as proved earlier in real eigenvalue regime , @xmath44 we have @xmath45 multiplying @xmath46 from left we have @xmath47 also multiplying @xmath41=@xmath42 by @xmath48 from right we have equating with ( 7 ) that @xmath49 summing over i=1 to n gives @xmath50 where @xmath38 let us check the properties of the matrix @xmath0 . note : we have not yet proved that @xmath3 i.e state space of h forms a hilbert space ( complete orthogonal vector space ) .",
    "we have not yet proved @xmath0 is invertible , such that we can always use the relation @xmath51=@xmath5 for finite dimensions .      if we have @xmath52 and eigenvalues of @xmath14 are necessarily real , then ( @xmath18,@xmath20 ) will be orthogonal to each other under @xmath53 as inner product and where , @xmath39 and @xmath40      we know that @xmath0h@xmath37=@xmath5 in real eigenvalue regime @xmath54 @xmath55 previous theorem gives @xmath56 hence , by ( 10 ) we see that @xmath57 therefore , @xmath58 has to be @xmath59 so that , @xmath60 we can see that if we use the operator @xmath0 which we previously saw was the operator relating h and h@xmath61 by similarity transform , that @xmath62 @xmath63    hence @xmath0 renders the state space of h , @xmath27 to be now a complete orthonormal vector space , i.e a hilbert space with sesquilinear form @xmath64 as the inner product .",
    "let us now on denote it by @xmath3 .",
    "it can also be verified by example that gram - schmidt orthogonalisation will not work for non - hermitian systems if it uses identity as metric .",
    "we can easily see that @xmath0=@xmath65 : @xmath66 as ( ab)@xmath61=b@xmath61a@xmath61 , where a and b are matrices .",
    "hence , we have @xmath67      @xmath0 is always invertible see , @xcite . as @xmath0 has a full rank because , @xmath68 and all @xmath69 are linearly independent of each other as they are eigenvectors of h@xmath61 .",
    "hence , the relation @xmath70 will always exist for finite dimensions .",
    "some emphasis has to be given to square roots of matrices , because they will be useful to elaborate isospectrality .",
    "a matrix has square root iff it is diagonalizable , and a hermitian matrix is a always diagonalizable , hence square root of a hermitian matrix always exists s.t .",
    "a@xmath61a = b , where a is square root of b. a matrix has many roots .",
    "a point to be noted is not all square roots of a hermitian matrix be hermitian ( not properly emphasized even in , @xcite ) , example : @xmath71 we can see that @xmath72 a@xmath73a@xmath61 but b = b@xmath61 where a , b@xmath74 .",
    "also , it can be easily checked that as @xmath0 is always invertible it s root is also always invertible .",
    "this property has implications as we will see in section 5 .",
    "we already saw that @xmath0h@xmath37=@xmath5 ; we define this property as pseudo - hermiticity , for hermitian h we see that @xmath0=@xmath75 , identity matrix . analogous to unitary matrix u@xmath61=u@xmath76 similarly a matrix p we define pseudo - unitarity as @xmath77 s.t . @xmath78 note : unitary transformations preserve norm for hermitian systems , then pseudo - unitary transformations preserve norm for pseudo - hermitian systems .",
    "we saw that @xmath0 is hermitian and hence it s root always exists .",
    "@xmath54 we can always write @xmath79 suppose , we define an operator h by a similarity transform on pseudo - hermitian operator h then , @xmath1h@xmath80=h      prove that h is hermitian .",
    "we know @xmath1h@xmath80=h , then , h@xmath81=(@xmath80)@xmath61h@xmath61@xmath82 , but h@xmath61=@xmath0h@xmath83 so @xmath84 @xmath85 as , @xmath1 always exists and hence h always will exist such that h is hermitian , h and h are isospectral partners because similarity transformation always preserves the eigenvalue of the operator .",
    "moreover , we will see that the observables in pseudo - hermitian theory are different in form than that of hermitian theory , but their values always exactly match that of isospectral hermitian partner .",
    "hence , there will be no way to distinguish such systems in real eigenvalue regime .",
    "+ moreover , we saw that for finite dimensions @xmath1 will always exist without exception as @xmath0 will always exist , and thus there will always exist a @xmath86 for corresponding @xmath14 .      in conventional theory an observable is defined as an operator which provides real expectation values , moreover adjointness of the operator is also important , usually in textbooks , hermiticity and self - adjointness are synonymous with each other but it is not true .",
    "an , operator @xmath87 is called adjoint of @xmath6 if , @xmath88 moreover , @xmath6 is called self - adjoint if @xmath89 .",
    "so , as we see in hermitian theory , h = h@xmath90 and hence a is also self - adjoint in hermitian theory . in pseudo - hermitian theory as @xmath0h@xmath83=h@xmath90 , h is called pseudo - hermitian , it is also called as pseudo - self - adjoint @xmath91 . in a similar fashion , all other observables in pseudo - hermitian theory are pseudo - self - adjoint i.e. @xmath92 this , can be seen in the example of 2@xmath212 matrix given in appendix , that pauli matrices do not remain usual pauli matrices in the pseudo - hermitian theory , otherwise we would get complex expectation values of spin .",
    "now , we will see that the states of pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian have same expectation values of observables as given by states of it s hermitian iso - spectral partners .",
    "similar to h it can be seen that all observables are related to their hermitian iso - spectral observables by transformation , @xmath93 where @xmath7 is an observable for a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian system while @xmath6 is an observable for a hermitian hamiltonian system , and @xmath94 . as , we saw earlier , @xmath1h@xmath80=h , where h = h@xmath90 and @xmath95=@xmath0 , @xmath0 being the metric of hilbert space of h. so , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 hence , we can see that their expectation values match and there is no way to distinguish a hermitian system from a system with non - hermitian hamiltonian in the real eigenvalue regime .",
    "however , as stated in appendix the structure of the state space might seem different from that of it s isospectral hermitian partner , but it is not ( see appendix and section 8 of , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite mentions that composite systems might provide a way to distinguish these systems , in this paper we show that even in these kind of systems we can find an isospectral hermitian hamiltonian , also we provide an information theoretic framework and show that von - neumann entropy of h and it s partner h provide same value provided the form of von - neumann entropy in pseudo - hermitian theory is changed in form just like the form of observables are changed .",
    "we also , show that entanglement entropy of composite systems of hermitian@xmath100pseudo - hermitian and pseudo - hermitian@xmath100pseudo - hermitian will not change if they are transformed to their isospectral partners under similarity transform .",
    "for this in later sections we will have to properly develop pseudo - hermiticity in density operator language and try to leave no room for error .",
    "the method given in , @xcite to effectively describe a dissipative system involves , complex hamiltonian @xmath101 where , @xmath102 denotes the hamiltonian for the system and @xmath103 is hermitian part ( hence always has real eigenvalues ) and @xmath104 is the part through which we can control dissipation and is dependent on parameter @xmath105 .",
    "now , for the bath the hamiltonian is given as , @xmath106 s.t .",
    "@xmath107 where h is hermitian and has real eigenvalues ( hence overall it is not dissipating ) .",
    "it can be seen that if only the system hamiltonian is considered , then it is given as ( 18 ) , and in the real eigenvalue regime as stated in previous two sections , the system acts like a hermitian system .",
    "note that it is not equivalent to making @xmath108 but even if @xmath109 the system acts as if it is not dissipating .",
    "it can be seen using the example @xmath110 matrix given in appendix .",
    "also , it has been experimentally verified in .@xcite",
    "in hermitian theory we have two major types of measurements i.e. pvm and povms.@xcite pvms : these are measurements where the observation does not destroy the observed state , repeated measurements provide same results .",
    "these are idealised measurements and are extremely rare to create .",
    "mathematically , in hermitian theory , these measurements are given by projection operators which have following two important properties , @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath111 and @xmath112also @xmath113 now , @xmath114 where , @xmath115 are basis of h ; s.t .",
    "h = h@xmath61 .",
    "if we define @xmath116 then @xmath117 all the above properties can be verified for @xmath118 .",
    "any state @xmath119 where @xmath120 are the probability amplitudes for eigenvectors @xmath115 of observable @xmath6 and they have complex values .",
    "the probability of obtaining particular ith state is .",
    "@xmath121    after . the measurement @xmath15 changes to @xmath122 , if a measurement in such a type of scheme is performed again we get @xmath123 and it is same as @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "these types of measurements are called pvm or projection operator valued measurements. @xmath124      as the inner products are changed the outer products also need to be changed for consistency . hence , the projection operator for pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian is given as @xmath125 s.t .",
    "@xmath126 @xmath127 are probability amplitudes , and the probability of obtaining ith state , upon measurement , when a system is in state @xmath128 is @xmath129 usually in hermitian theory we write @xmath130 but this statement is more subtle than this .",
    "the point is that for complex matrices we reserve the definition @xmath131 for @xmath132 and in hermitian theory we have @xmath133 hence @xmath134 as a fact of idempotency .",
    "however if we follow the same definition of @xmath135 in pseudo - hermitian theory it creates ambiguities .",
    "but it can be seen that in pseudo - hermitian theory even if @xmath136 @xmath137 and hence it can be seen that operating projection operator @xmath11 twice does not affect the previous measurement result .",
    "note that @xmath11 is a pseudo - hermitian operator .",
    "we will see what happens when repeated measurements affect the state after measurement .",
    "povm ( positive operator valued measure ) are more general type of measurements than pvms .",
    "unlike , pvm repeated measurements do not provide same measurement values , ex : a photon falling on a photographic plate will have been altered drastically to be measured again .",
    "mathematically , these are represented by more general positive semidefinite operators , which have following properties , @xmath138 always , m is just the index for denoting mth state .",
    "post - measurement state is given by @xmath139 upto normalisation .",
    "but repeated measurement will not give same value .",
    "for , pseudo - hermitian theory , @xmath140 are selected such that they do not from @xmath141 .",
    "first , we develop a density operator formalism for pseudo - hermitian theory .",
    "this is done because this formalism provides more flexibility to talk about mixed states .",
    "later we consider , composite systems and quantify certain properties of these quantum systems , like entanglement . under this formalism",
    "we see that , there is no way that new phenomenon can emerge from composite systems of pseudo - hermitian@xmath100hermitian systems(denoted h@xmath100h ) and pseudo - hermitian@xmath100pseudo - hermitian ( denoted h@xmath142 @xmath100h@xmath143 ) systems .",
    "also , it is shown that the form of entanglement entropy(e ( ) ) as well as of von neumann entropy ( v ( ) ) has to be changed and under this new form it can be shown ( for both cases stated above ) that the values e ( ) of an entangled state in h and of an isospectral entangled state in h will be same , hence the entanglement entropy does not reduce as stated in , @xcite due to isospectrality . also , it is easy to prove that rate of entanglement of both of these types of systems will be same .",
    "let us usually denote hermitian systems by h and it s eigenvectors as @xmath144 which form an orthogonal basis for @xmath2 hilbert space for h. @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath146 is the density operator for pure states of h. see , @xcite . where , @xmath147 , where z denotes state of the system and second index denotes the basis vector of the system being considered , also @xmath148 , are probability amplitudes . following",
    "relations always hold for such systems , @xmath149 and tr@xmath150 , and tr@xmath151 , because @xmath152 .",
    "also , expectation values of any observable @xmath6 is given by @xmath153=tr@xmath154 all these properties can be checked taking a state as @xmath155 . for pseudo - hermitian system h , with eigenvectors @xmath156 and having a hilbert space @xmath3 with metric @xmath0 , s.t .",
    "@xmath68 where @xmath157 , n being dimension of h.    analogously for pure states of pseudo - hermitian systems , we define @xmath158 sticking to this definition , we can see that @xmath159 , where m denotes the state of system .",
    "note , @xmath160 .",
    "but it can be checked that @xmath161 i.e. it is pseudo - hermitian . tr@xmath162=@xmath163=1 this happens because @xmath164=1 . also ,",
    "@xmath165,but @xmath166 the expectation value of an observable @xmath7 is given as @xmath167 now , using the iso - spectrality property we can see that , @xmath168 where @xmath1 is the similarity transformation operator between pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian h to it s iso - spectral hermitian hamiltonian h. @xmath169 and it can also be checked that , using cyclic property of trace , @xmath170 @xmath171 h and h are indistinguishable .",
    "there are two cases which arise for statistical mixtures , ( pseudo - hermitian and pseudo - hermitian ) and ( pseudo - hermitian and hermitian ) mixtures .",
    "firstly , revising hermitian systems theory , state of mixtures can not be written as @xmath172 .",
    "they are formed due to incomplete information .",
    "example : a screen which is impinged upon by 70% of vertically polarised light from one source and 30% from other being horizontally polarised .",
    "they can only be written in density operator form .",
    "@xmath173 , where p@xmath174 denote probability of finding a certain state forming the mixture and @xmath175 , l is the number of systems forming the mixture.(ex:@xmath176 ) .",
    "75% are impinged upon from system 1 as @xmath177 and other 30% from system 2 as @xmath178 .",
    "tr@xmath179 and tr@xmath180 .",
    "density operator in such conditions is given as @xmath181 where , @xmath182 are the metric for corresponding systems of which mixture is made of , @xmath175 where p denote the percentage of the individual systems which make the mixture , l is the number of individual systems making up the mixture and @xmath183 be individual density operators .",
    "analogous to hermitian case , @xmath184 . due to the iso - spectrality",
    "it can be seen that individual systems @xmath185and we can write , @xmath186 and we get the expectation values , by substituting previous results @xmath187      out of total l mixtures consider a mixture of e pseudo - hermitian systems and l - e hermitian systems .",
    "then , the density operator is defined as , @xmath188 where @xmath189 and @xmath190 and @xmath182 are metric for corresponding hilbert spaces of pseudo - hermitian systems . here , as in previous case we define @xmath183 and @xmath191 , also as usual notation h correspond to non - hermitian and h correspond to hermitian , also @xmath192 it can also be easily checked that , tr@xmath193=1 .",
    "also as we saw in previous section , @xmath194 and and the relation @xmath195 , where these new @xmath196 belong to hermitian isospectral system of h@xmath174s .",
    "now , we get using all these results that , @xmath197 @xmath198    @xmath199    it can be seen in all the scenarios of a non - composite system , the open system in real eigenvalue regime acts like a hermitian system(non - dissipating system ) .",
    "as we changed the form of observables in a hermitian setting from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , by relation @xmath200 .",
    "an example is properly elaborated in the appendix that the representation of pauli matrices need to be changed to properly get real expectation values of spin .",
    "it is a simple fact that due to isospectrality the values of entropy of h and h will be same because the von - neumann entropy is defined as @xmath201 , where @xmath202 are the eigenvalues of @xmath9 and @xmath8 both .",
    "this happens due to similarity equivalence between them , and similarity transformations preserve eigenvalues .",
    "this is contrast to ideas taken up by , @xcite where they have ignored that the two equivalent formulae for von - neumann entropy do not follow in the same way as in pseudo - hermitian theory .",
    "this can be proved in density matrix form using the iso - spectrality condition . in hermitian",
    "setting , another way of quantifying von - neumann entropy is given as @xmath203 where logarithm is to the base 2 .",
    "for , pseudo - hermitian hamiltonians however the proper form of von - neumann entropy should be given as below , so that there is consistency in definition of von - neumann entropy @xmath204 then it can be easily seen that due to the transformation .",
    "@xmath205 , that @xmath206",
    "let us first revise composite systems in hermitian theory .",
    "usually if two systems are to be represented simultaneously , then these systems are to be represented using tensor product @xmath100 of the matrices representing them .",
    "let us consider for simplicity of case of bipartite ( i.e 2 systems ) composite system , which can be generalized to many more systems ( multipartite ) by generalization .",
    "as we are for revision considering bipartite hermitian composite system , we denote the hamiltonians of these systems as , @xmath207 and @xmath208 , which form a composite system @xmath86 denoted by , @xmath209 .",
    "we will denote the dimensions of these systems by e and f. any state residing in the hilbert space of such a system is given by , @xmath210 where @xmath211 and @xmath212 and @xmath213 and @xmath214 are probability amplitudes as in @xmath215 .",
    "we will particularly focus on what happens to inner product metric for such systems , it is not always explicitly emphasized that metric of inner product of a bipartite systems is @xmath216 .",
    "these metrics are such that @xmath217 and @xmath218 .    @xmath219 is called seperable if it can be decomposed as ,    @xmath220 .",
    "if it can not be decomposed as earlier then it is called entangled.    a few important results while using tensor products are as such ,    @xmath221    a , b , c , d can be any column , row , square matrices .",
    "therefore , @xmath222 @xmath217and @xmath218 and using the properties stated above .      for simplicity , we will consider henceforward , that we are considering systems in pure states .",

    "s is the dimension of the square density matrix where e@xmath21f = s , where e is dimension of @xmath207 and f is dimension of @xmath208 .",

    "we learned that theory of pseudo - hermiticity can be consistently applied to dissipative quantum systems , @xcite .",

    "we saw that the von - neumann entropy and entanglement entropy of these non - hermitian systems ( in real eigenvalue regime)are same a their hermitian counterparts .",
    "hence , it does not have effect on the rate of entanglement creation as shown in @xcite , nor can composite systems of these systems be used to distinguish the non - hermitian and their hermitian iso - spectral partners .",
    "here we will give examples of the results obtained earlier .",
    "firstly we give the example of a @xmath329 non - hermitian matrix in the real eigenvalue regime , and show how it is related to an isospectral - hermitian hamiltonian , both algebraically and geometrically .",
    "next we will see by analogy the geometry of a composite pseudo - hermitian system .",
    "the following appendix is based on , @xcite .",
    "we can see in both cases eigenvectors are orthogonal to each other . as we know",
    "the state space of a hermitian @xmath329 system can be projected onto a bloch sphere , always .",
    "we can see that geometrically the act of unitary transformation just rotates the bloch sphere .",
    "it can be seen as follows , by calculating the bloch vector , it shows that for the eigenvector of hamiltonian in eq(41 ) @xmath334 and for eq(42 ) it is @xmath335 which shows that their bloch vectors are only rotated by @xmath105 angle .",
    "it can also be seen that the geodesic distance between both eigenvectors of eq(41 ) and of eq(42 ) have distance @xmath1 and hence they are orthogonal to each other . the geodesic distance between @xmath336 and @xmath337",
    "is given as @xmath338 .",
    "moreover , the eigenvalues and expectation values of the observables of these systems will be real as is already known . however , the hamiltonian      is not unitarily equivalent to eq(41 ) or eq(42 ) hamiltonian . instead , if a matrix is untarily equivalent to one matrix then it is unitarily equivalent to all other matrices which are unitarily equivalent to the first matrix .",
    "this , hamiltonian is non - hermitian with eigenvalues @xmath340 the eigenvectors for @xmath341 and @xmath342 in the real eigenvalue regime ( i.e. when      @xmath344 where , @xmath345 and eigenvalues become @xmath346 .",
    "it can be easily seen that the eigenvectors are not orthonormal to each other and if we find the eigenvectors of @xmath5 in the real eigenvalue regime then they turn out to be .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath348 and @xmath349 , we can create an operator @xmath350 s.t we get all the eigenvectors of eq(43 ) be orthogonal to each other i.e. @xmath351 and @xmath352 where , now representation of @xmath0 =      and square root of @xmath0 which is found by diagonalizing @xmath0 and then taking square roots of the diagonal elements of @xmath0 and then again transforming the root diagonal form to root non - diagonal form .",
    "we , get @xmath354 where @xmath355 and @xmath356 it can be easily be seen that @xmath1 is not unitary ( @xmath357 ) . @xmath358",
    "it can now be checked that h can be transformed to an isospectral hermitian hamiltonian by a similarity transform using @xmath1 s.t .",
    "@xmath273 and @xmath274",
    ". for , this case the hamiltonian turns out to be @xmath359 with eigenvectors , @xmath360    it can be easily seen that it s eigenvalue is same as h , the eigenvectors @xmath16 being , @xmath361 s.t . @xmath362 and @xmath363 .",
    "hence the geodesic distance between @xmath364 and @xmath365 is @xmath1 as their values are same as the orthogonal eigenvectors of h and it is well known that the geodesic distance between orthogonal vectors under metric @xmath75 is @xmath1 , where @xmath1 here is angle in radians .",
    "this can also be checked by using the formula for geodesic distance between two states in the projective space of the state space of a pseudo - hermitian system , given by , @xmath366 check , @xcite .",
    "note now if we try to find the bloch vectors of corresponding eigenvectors of eq(43 ) using usual pauli matrices then @xmath367 gives value @xmath368 which is a complex value .",
    "hence , the expectation value of spin will be complex , so the observables need to be changed .",
    "we will see that indeed we just changed the representation of the observables however they will give same expectation values for corresponding isospectral states . as",
    ", we already saw the observable given by hamiltonian is changed as @xmath273 the pauli matrices will also change as @xmath369 s.t . now it can be easily seen that @xmath370 and hence the projective space of h is same as that of h , which is hermitian .",
    "we can check that only the arrangement of the state space has changed between the pseudo - hermitian and iso - spectral hermtian system .",
    "all the expectation values will match between the systems .",
    "all of the above properties can be visualized as given by fig.1 .",
    "we will have for a separable state of such a composite system that the complex projective space of it can be decomposed into two individual bloch spheres representing the two states making up this seperable state .",
