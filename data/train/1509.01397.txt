    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are rapidly spinning neutron stars ( nss ) formed in a binary system where a slowly rotating ns is spun up through mass accretion from an evolving companion star .",
    "the recycling process is usually observed in the low mass x - ray binary systems , which are commonly considered as the msp progenitors @xcite .",
    "indeed , when the mass accretion rate decreases and the ns is sufficiently recycled , the rotation - powered emission is switched on and the system is observable as a msp in the radio band .",
    "these processes usually lead to a deep transformation of the companion star which can transit through a highly perturbed evolutionary phase ( possibly like msp - a in ngc 6397 ; * ? ? ?",

    "according to the canonical scenario , the majority of binary msps have low - mass he wd companions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent pulsar ( psr ) searches have considerably increased the number of non - canonical systems , especially the so - called  black widows \" and  redbacks \" : ultra - compact binary systems ( @xmath3 day ) where the presence of radio eclipses suggests the presence of ionized material ablated from a bloated companion star because of the energy injected by the psr @xcite .",
    "redback companion stars usually have masses of @xmath4 , while black widow companions are much less massive ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "such a small value could be due to vaporization from the strong msp radiation and relativistic wind .",
    "the physical mechanisms bringing to one or the other system are still debated .",
    "simulations by @xcite show that redbacks and black widows are the outcome of different evolutionary paths , where the psr irradiation efficiency is the discriminant factor . at odds with these results ,",
    "the simulations by @xcite show that the evolution of redbacks is bifurcated , with some of them evolving into black widows , and the others producing canonical he wd systems .",
    "possibly , the progressive evaporation of the black widow companions could lead to the total disruption of the star and then to the formation of isolated msps .",

    "then we performed a source detection analysis , setting a @xmath12 detection limit , where @xmath2 is the standard deviation of the measured background .",
    "once a list of stars was obtained , we performed a psf - fitting in each image using the allstar routine . in the resulting catalog we included only objects present at least in half the images for each filter",

    ", we used , first of all , the wide field catalog presented in @xcite . its astrometric solution has been improved by cross - correlationpaolo / main / catapack.html , and has been successfully used in a large number of papers by our group in the past 10 years . ] with the ucac4 astrometric standard catalog ( @xcite ; @xmath14 stars have been found in common between the two datasets ) .",
    "the latter is based on the international celestial reference system , thus allowing a more appropriate comparison with the msp positions derived from timing using solar system ephemerides ( which are referenced to the same system ) .",

    "stars located within the @xmath24 uncertainty from the pulsar position have been considered as possibile counterparts .",
    "four companions ( to 47tucq , 47tucs , 47tuct and 47tucy ) have been identified on the basis of their positional coincidence ( all of them are located at a distance @xmath25 from the nominal radio position ) and of their position in the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "two faint stars have been detected also within the @xmath24 uncertainty circle from 47tuci and 47tuch .",
    "however , their distances ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively ) from the pulsar radio positions are significantly larger than in all the other cases , thus casting doubts about these objects being the true optical counterparts ( see more discussion in section  [ comh ] ) .",

    "note in fact that the probability of a chance coincidence with another he wd is extremely low ( @xmath29 ) astrometric uncertainty .",
    "we derived the he wd density by direct counting of the all objects located among the cooling tracks ( see section  [ prop ] and figure  [ cmdwd ] ) and dividing this number by the size of the wfc3 field of view .",
    "please note that even including all the stars of the catalog with sharpness @xmath30 , the chance probability remains @xmath31 .",
    "] , since these objects can only be the product of the late stage of the evolution of exotic objects like , for example , msps and cataclysmic variables .",
    "the candidate companion to 47tuci is instead a main sequence - like object , and its properties will be briefly discussed in section [ comh ] . as concerns the previously known companions , com-47tucu is also located along the he wd sequence , while the redback com-47tucw is located in an anomalous region between the main sequence and the wd cooling sequence ( see section  [ w ] ) .    with the exception of the com-47tucw ,",
    "no significant variability related to the orbital period has been detected . for 47tucu , 47tucy and 47tucw ( see section  [ w ] ) the observations sample a significant fraction of the orbital period . instead , for the other systems ( with orbital periods longer than 1 day ) the coverage is too poor to allow any appropriate variability analysis .",
    "however , a strong magnitude modulation , as the one observed for non degenerate companions ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is not expected and usually not observed for degenerate objects , since the flux enhancement due to re - heating of the companion star by the psr emitted energy is negligible .",
    "in order to constrain the main properties of the he wd companions , we have compared the position of each candidate in the cmd with a set of he wd cooling tracks computed by @xcite .",
    "these models span a mass range from @xmath0 to @xmath32 , spaced at about @xmath33 for masses between @xmath0 to @xmath34 and up to @xmath35 for larger masses .",
    "we transformed the theoretical luminosities and temperatures into the absolute f300x and f390w magnitudes , by applying the bolometric corrections kindly provided by p. bergeron ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "then , the model absolute magnitudes have been transformed into the apparent ones by using the distance modulus @xmath36 @xcite for all the companion stars ) ] . and the color excess @xmath37 @xcite and extinction coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ cmdwd ] shows the zoomed portion of the cmd in the wd region with a sample of cooling tracks for different masses overplotted .",
    "as can be seen , the range in mass of the models is large enough to properly sample the portion of the cmd where all the companions are located .",
    "therefore we used this set of models to derive the combinations of parameters ( mass , cooling age and temperature ) that simultaneously satisfy the observed photometric magnitudes in both the filters , also taking into account the uncertainties on the companion magnitudes , distance modulus and reddening .",
    "the best values have been evaluated with a simple @xmath11 statistic . in doing this ,",
    "linear interpolations ( for different masses but equal ages ) among the tracks have been performed in order to have a tighter mass sampling .",
    "we assumed that each companion is located at the distance of 47 tucanae and it is affected by the same extinction .",
    "figure [ bo1 ] shows , for each system , the combination of cooling age ( left panel ) , temperature ( central panel ) and psr mass ( right panel ) appropriate for the derived value of the companion mass . in particular , in each plot",
    "the right panel shows the results obtained for different values of the inclination angle and interesting constrains on each system can be drawn .",
    "for instance , by setting the inclination angle to @xmath40 , the maximum psr mass allowed from the inferred companion mass can be evaluated .",
    "conversely , by assuming the minimum psr mass equal to @xmath41 ( the lowest mass ever measured for a ns ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a conservative lower limit to the inclination angle can be derived .",
    "all these results are also summarized in table  [ tab3 ] where the quoted uncertainties are the range of possibile values allowed by the comparison with the theoretical tracks .",
    "note that we are not analyzing here the cases of 47tuch and 47tuci , which we will discuss in section  [ comh ] .",
    "as can be seen , all the companions have masses between @xmath42 and  @xmath43 .",
    "the derived ranges of ages are in agreement with the lower limits to the psr characteristic ages reported in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the only exception is com-47tucu , which is discussed below . in principle",
    "the mass of com-47tucq could be smaller than our best - fit value ( @xmath44 ) , since not theoretical tracks for masses below this value are available .",
    "however , already a @xmath45 companion would imply an extremely low value of the psr mass ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this puzzling result could be partially explained with the difficulty of accurately determine the color of the optical counterpart , because of the presence of a very close bright object ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "our results rule out a massive ns in the case of 47tucq and 47tuct , while the possibility of a @xmath47 ns remains opened in the cases of 47tucs , 47tucu and 47tucy .",
    "however , figure  [ bo1 ] shows that the psr mass can be significantly reduced by assuming an intermediate - low inclination angle of the orbital plane . in any case",
    "these systems are worthy of future , especially spectroscopical , investigations .",
    "we also compared our results with the theoretical predictions on the behavior of the orbital period as a function of the companion mass discussed in @xcite .",
    "such a model has been already empirically verified by @xcite and @xcite . as shown in figure  [ mp ] , where we also added the two he wd companions identified in ngc 6752 and m4 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our results are in reasonable agreement with the model .",
    "the analytical prediction seems to slightly overestimate the companion mass or to underestimate the system orbital period . however , this model is valid for binary systems with @xmath48 , thus only marginally representative of our sample , where most of the companions appear to be less massive than @xmath49 .",
    "more updated models ( from @xcite ; gray points in figure  [ mp ] ) are in better agreement , although they are the results of simulations of donor stars with metallicity @xmath50 , larger than that of 47 tucanae    ( i.e. @xmath51 , * ? ? ?",
    ".    the brightness of com-47tucu allowed us to put tighter constraints to the system parameters with respect to the other objects .",
    "both its mass and temperature are in excellent agreement with those reported in @xcite , while our derived age ( @xmath52 gyr ) turns out to be 0.3 gyr larger than their estimate",
    ". such a discrepancy could be due to the different theoretical models used .",
    "however , as already noticed by @xcite , the cooling age is significantly lower than the characteristic age of 2.5 gyrs .",
    "this discrepancy should not alarm , since the psr characteristic ages are based on many assumptions and large deviations from the companion cooling ages are commonly observed ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the wd age together with the intrinsic spin period derivative ( @xmath53 ; freire et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and the actual spin period ( @xmath54 ms ) , we evaluated a msp birth spin period ( the so - called equilibrium spin period ) of @xmath55 ms .",
    "this value , combined with the surface magnetic field ( @xmath56 g ) and assuming a ns with a radius of 10 km and a canonical mass of @xmath57 , can be used to infer the typical accretion rate that reaccelerated the ns during the low mass x - ray binary phase . by using equation ( 8) of @xcite , we find that the system past accretion history likely proceeded at a sub - eddington rate @xmath58 , as expected from the typical evolution of close binary systems with light donor stars @xcite .",
    "although the mass accretion rate strongly depends on the ns radius , the general result does not change assuming different radii or even different ns masses .",
    "as can be seen from figures [ cmd ] , [ cmdwd ] and [ mp ] , the possible companion to 47tuch appears to have properties quite different from those observed for the other companions , first of all its much larger distance from the msp nominal position ( @xmath27 ) , which corresponds to almost twice our astrometric uncertainty .",
    "moreover , following the procedure adopted in the previous section , we derived for this object a mass of @xmath59 .",
    "this value , combined with the binary system total mass of @xmath60 @xcite , would imply a psr mass of @xmath61 , a value slightly lower than expected for a recycled psr , although still acceptable within the uncertainties .",
    "its position in the cmd is compatible also with the co wd cooling sequence , which would increase the probability of a chance coincidence to @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , at odds with the others objects , this candidate counterpart occupies an anomalous region in the orbital period companion mass plane shown in figure  [ mp ] .",
    "although this anomaly could be real ( since 47tuch has a large eccentricity , probably due to some kind of dynamical interaction ) , all these pieces of evidence suggest that the observed object is probably an isolated wd and the true companion star is still under the detection threshold ( see section  [ nondec ] ) .",
    "a possible candidate companion to msp 47tuci has been also detected ( see figure  [ fig1 ] for the finding chart ) .",
    "this is a binary system with a short orbital period ( @xmath63 days ) and a very small eccentricity . from the psr mass function",
    ", the companion is expected to be a very low mass star ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the absence of radio eclipses , probably due to a low inclination angle , prevents its characterization as a black widow system . at @xmath26 from the psr position , we identified a star located at the faint - end of the cluster main sequence ( see figure  [ cmd ] and table  [ tab2 ] ) . if we assume that the companion is a bloated star seen in a binary system with a low inclination angle , such a cmd position could be reasonable",
    "however , the lack of any significant variability related to the orbital period prevents us from firmly associating this candidate to the msp .",
    "in fact , the orbital period coverage of the f390w images is too poor , while the signal to noise ratio of the f300x data allows us to only infer that , in case of photometric variability , the maximum variation amplitude must be smaller than @xmath65 mag .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is more likely that the real companion star is still under the detection threshold .",
    "indeed , the probability of a chance coincidence with a main sequence star is non negligible ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "we finally note that another object lies within the astrometric uncertainty circle , but its association with the msp can be excluded , since it is a common co wd , with properties incompatible with the msp timing ephemeris .",
    "no interesting counterparts have been identified for all the other known binary msps .",
    "these non - detections are likely due to companion stars still under the detection threshold ( as in the case , e.g. , of 47tuce and the black widow 47tucj ) , or to the severe crowding conditions of the area surrounding the msp positions ( as in the case of the black widows 47tuco and 47tucr ) .",
    "no search could be performed for 47tucx since its position is outside the field of view .",
    "considering that the companion to 47tucj should be a non - degenerate object , its non - detection in uv passbands can not be used to get useful information on its properties . instead",
    ", the counterpart to 47tuce is expected to be he wd , which remains undetected down to our limiting magnitudes ( @xmath67 in the f300x filter and @xmath68 in the f390w filter ) .",
    "hence , taking into account that the cooling age of a @xmath69 wd at these detection thresholds is larger than the cluster age ( @xmath70 gyr ; @xcite ) , it is unlikely that this star has a mass similar to that estimated for the other companions .",
    "it is more probable that it is more massive than @xmath71 ( corresponding to a faster cooling ) and its cooling age is larger than 1 gyr .",
    "the same should apply also to the case of 47tuch if its true companion is still under our detection limits ( as suggested above ) .",
    "interestingly , according to the theoretical relation of @xcite and the orbital periods of 47tuce and 47tuch ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 days , respectively ) , the companions to both these mpss are indeed expected to have masses @xmath74 .",
    "47tucw is the only redback identified , so far , in 47 tucanae .",
    "it is a binary msp with a spin period of 2.35 ms , an orbital period of @xmath75 hr @xcite and a companion mass of @xmath42 .",
    "the first optical identification of this system was presented in @xcite , who suggested that the companion is a perturbed and non degenerate star with a light curve structure indicating a strong heating by the psr flux . in figure  [ curva ]",
    "we show , for both the filters , the light curves we obtained by folding our photometric measurements with the most updated radio timing ephemeris ( freire et al .",
    ", in preparation )",
    ". the zero orbital phase has been set at the psr ascending node time .",
    "as can be seen , in agreement with previous works @xcite , the light curves present a single maximum - minimum structure , likely due to the heating by the psr flux .",
    "unfortunately , the star has been measured above the detection threshold only near its maximum luminosity .",
    "nonetheless , modeling the sinusoidal light curve , we found that , in both the filters , the companion spans @xmath76 magnitudes between the maximum and the derived minimum , in agreement with previous observations .",
    "the best fit - model is shown as a solid curve in figure  [ curva ] .",
    "interestingly , the light curve structure is more similar to the ones observed for black widow than for redback companions , which usually , but not always , show a double minimum - maximum structure due to tidal deformation ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cmd position of the companion during the maximum and at a mean phase ( as derived by the adopted model ) is shown in figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "the system is located between the main sequence and the wd cooling sequence , where no normal stars are expected and thus suggesting a perturbed and strongly heated companion star .",
    "again , at odds with other redback systems , this lies in a region more similar to that occupied by the two black widow companions identified so far in gcs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cadelano et al . , 2015 ) .",
    "the x - ray counterpart to 47tucw shows a variability which is likely due to an intra - binary shock between the psr wind and the matter lost by the companion @xcite .",
    "interestingly , as discussed by @xcite , the minimum of the x - ray light curve is displaced with respect to the optical one .",
    "such a behavior has been also noticed for the black widow m71a @xcite , thus further strengthening the connection of this msp with black widow systems .",
    "all this allow us to speculate that a scenario where 47tucw will evolve into a canonical msp with a he wd companion ( as in the case of msp - a in ngc 6397 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is somewhat unlikely , opening the possibility to an evolution toward the black widow stages .",
    "indeed such an evolutionary path has been already suggested by the simulations of @xcite .",
    "the identification of new redback companions will shed light on this possibility .",
    "by using ultra - deep , high resolution uv wfc3/hst observations of 47 tucanae , we identified the companions to four binary msps ( 47tucq , 47tucs , 47tuct and 47tucy ) and confirmed the two already known objects ( com-47tucu and com-47tucw ) .",
    "the optical counterparts have coordinates compatible , within the errors , with the psr nominal positions . in the cmd ,",
    "all the objects are located in the he wd cooling sequence , as expected from the msp canonical evolutionary scenario .",
    "the only exception is the companion to the redback system 47tucw , which is located in an anomalous region between the main sequence and the wd cooling sequence , suggesting that it is a low - mass ms star highly perturbed and heated by the psr flux .",
    "we compared the observed cmd positions of the detected he wd companions with a set of cooling tracks and derived the companion main properties ( as masses , cooling ages , temperatures ) and also some constraints on the psr masses .",
    "all the companion stars have masses between @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and all the derived cooling ages are smaller than the cluster stellar population age .",
    "the orbital periods vs companion masses are in fair agreement with the evolutionary models of @xcite and @xcite . by combining the cooling age with the psr spin down rate we found that the accretion history of 47tucu likely proceeded at a sub - eddington rate .    by taking into account our astrometric uncertainty ( @xmath26 )",
    ", we also detected a star having a position marginally compatible with that of 47tuch .",
    "however , its photometric properties would imply a psr mass lighter than expected for a recycled ns .",
    "moreover , its position in the plane of orbital period vs. companion mass is in clear disagreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "while this could be due to its high eccentricity , the object could be just a chance coincidence and further investigations are needed before confirming its association to 47tuch .",
    "a possibile counterpart to 47tuci has been also identified in a star located in a low luminosity region of the cluster main sequence .",
    "however its distance from the msp position ( @xmath26 ) and the absence of any optical variability related to the orbital period do not allow us to asses a clear connection with the binary system .",
    "finally we discussed how the properties of com-47tucw are more similar to those usually observed for black widows than for redbacks , thus opening the possibility that this msp could be the prototype of a redback evolving into a black widow system .",
