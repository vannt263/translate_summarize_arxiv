    "interactions among nucleons are governed by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in the low - energy regime relevant to nuclear structure ,",
    "qcd is non - perturbative , and , therefore , hard to solve .",
    "thus , theory has been forced to resort to models for the interaction , which have limited physical basis .",
    "new theoretical developments , however , allow us connect qcd with low - energy nuclear physics . the chiral effective field theory ( @xmath3eft )",
    "@xcite provides a promising bridge .",
    "beginning with the pionic or the nucleon - pion system  @xcite one works consistently with systems of increasing nucleon number  @xcite .",
    "one makes use of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry to systematically expand the strong interaction in terms of a generic small momentum and takes the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry into account by expanding in the pion mass .",
    "thereby , the nn interaction , the nnn interaction and also @xmath4n scattering are related to each other . at the same time",
    ", the pion mass dependence of the interaction is known , which will enable a connection to lattice qcd calculations in the future  @xcite .",
    "nuclear interactions are non - perturbative , because diagrams with purely nucleonic intermediate states are enhanced @xcite .",
    "therefore , the chiral perturbation expansion is performed for the potential ( note , however , the discussion in refs .  @xcite that points out some potential inconsitencies of this approach ) . solving the schrdinger equation for this potential",
    "then automatically sums diagrams with purely nucleonic intermediate states to all orders .",
    "the @xmath3eft predicts , along with the nn interaction at the leading order , an nnn interaction at the 3rd order ( next - to - next - to - leading order or n@xmath0lo )  @xcite , and even an nnnn interaction at the 4th order ( n@xmath1lo )  @xcite .",
    "the details of qcd dynamics are contained in parameters , low - energy constants ( lecs ) , not fixed by the symmetry .",
    "these parameters can be constrained by experiment . at present , high - quality nn potentials have been determined at order n@xmath1lo  @xcite .",
    "a crucial feature of @xmath3eft is the consistency between the nn , nnn and nnnn parts . as a consequence , at n@xmath0lo and n@xmath1lo , except for two lecs , assigned to two nnn diagrams ,",
    "the potential is fully constrained by the parameters defining the nn interaction .",
    "it is of great interest and also a challenge to apply the chiral interactions in nuclear structure and nuclear reaction calculations . in a recent work  @xcite ,",
    "the presently available nn potential at n@xmath1lo  @xcite and the nnn interaction at n@xmath0lo  @xcite have been applied to the calculation of various properties of @xmath5- and @xmath6-shell nuclei , using the _ ab initio _ no - core shell model ( ncsm )  @xcite , up to now the only approach able to handle the nonlocal @xmath3eft nn potentials for systems beyond @xmath7 . in that study ,",
    "a preferred choice of the two nnn lecs , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , was found and the fundamental importance of the @xmath3eft nnn interaction was demonstrated for reproducing the structure of mid-@xmath6-shell nuclei . in a subsequent study ,",
    "the same hamiltonian was used to calculate microscopically the photo - absorption cross section of @xmath2he @xcite .    the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite differs in two aspects from the first ncsm application of the @xmath3eft nn+nnn interactions in ref .",
    "@xcite , which presents a detailed investigation of @xmath10li .",
    "first , a regulator depending on the momentum transfer in the nnn terms was introduced which results in a local @xmath3eft nnn interaction .",
    "second , the @xmath2he binding energy was not used exclusively as the second constraint on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 lecs .",
    "a local nnn interaction is advantages for some few- and many - body approaches because it is simpler to use . at the same time",
    ", it is known that details of the nnn interaction are important for nuclear structure applications .",
    "for example , the urbana ix  @xcite and the tucson - melbourne  @xcite nnn interactions perform differently in mid-@xmath6-shell nuclei  @xcite although their differences appear to be minor . in the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc )",
    "calculations with the av18 nn potential  @xcite , the best results for @xmath6-shell nuclei up to @xmath11 are found using the illinois nnn interaction that augments the urbana ix by a two - pion term from the tucson - melbourne nnn interaction and by three - pion terms that in the @xmath3eft appear beyond the n@xmath1lo  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the illinois nnn interaction , the @xmath3eft nnn interaction features the above mentioned consistency with the accompanying nn interaction .",
    "still , interestingly , we found that the nonlocal @xmath3eft nnn interaction used in ref .",
    "@xcite and the local @xmath3eft nnn interaction employed in ref .",
    "@xcite differ to some extent in their description of mid-@xmath6-shell nuclei with the latter giving results in a better agreement with experiment .",

    "it is the purpose of this paper to elaborate on the details of the local @xmath3eft nnn interaction used in refs .",
    "@xcite and present its matrix elements in the three - nucleon basis .",
    "technical details of dealing with nnn interactions were investigated in many papers  @xcite .",
    "a new feature in the present work is the use of @xmath3eft contact interactions and a focus on the application within the _ ab initio _ ncsm . in particular , we demonstrate the binding - energy convergence of the three - nucleon and four - nucleon systems with the @xmath3eft nn+nnn interactions using the _ ab initio _ ncsm . in sect .",
