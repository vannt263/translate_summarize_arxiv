    "as well known , the evidence for atmospheric @xmath0 disappearance observed in the super - kamiokande ( sk ) experiment @xcite can be explained by two - family oscillations with large mixing in the @xmath2 channel @xcite .",
    "when this solution , known as twofold maximal mixing , is assumed , the relevant flavor oscillation probabilities @xmath4 read : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the neutrino pathlength and energy , respectively , and the experimentally inferred value of the neutrino squared mass difference is @xcite @xmath8 within a factor of about two .",
    "oscillations in the @xmath2 channel are not affected by matter effects , and are consistent with the negative results of the chooz @xmath1 disappearance experiment @xcite , which requires @xmath9 for @xmath10 ev@xmath11 .",
    "conversely , two - family oscillations in the @xmath3 channel are heavily affected by matter effects , do not provide a good fit to sk data @xcite , and are independently excluded by chooz @xcite .",
    "going beyond pure @xmath2 oscillations , one should consider the possibility that the flavor eigenstates @xmath12 are linear combinations of three states @xmath13 with definite masses @xmath14 through a unitary matrix @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the mixing angles in the standard parametrization , and a possible cp violating phase has been neglected .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 should then be taken equal to one of the following squared mass differences : @xmath19 assuming that @xmath20 .",
    "different choices for @xmath18 have different implications for three - flavor scenarios .",
    "in particular , if @xmath18 is taken within chooz bounds ( i.e. , @xmath21 ev@xmath11 ) , then large @xmath0 disappearance in sk can be generated only by dominant @xmath2 oscillations , while @xmath3 transitions must be small ( or absent ) .",
    "this is the scenario favored by the quantitative analyses @xcite .    on the other hand , for @xmath22 ev@xmath11 the chooz bounds are not operative and , in principle , sizable @xmath3 oscillations can occur .",
    "even though it seems difficult to reconcile sk data with large @xmath1 mixing and relatively small @xmath18 @xcite , nevertheless , this possibility has been recently claimed in some phenomenological models , including : a ) `` threefold maximal mixing '' of solar and atmospheric neutrinos @xcite ; b ) three - flavor fits to solar , atmospheric , and accelerator evidence for neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "such models with large @xmath1 mixing are representative of the two possible identifications for @xmath18 , which is taken equal to @xmath23 in model ( a ) and to @xmath24 in model ( b ) .    since both models",
    "( a ) and ( b ) have received considerable and continued attention in the neutrino physics literature , it seems useful to assess clearly their phenomenological status through a quantitative study of the super - kamiokande observations . in this work , we perform such an analysis and show that model ( a ) is disfavored ( although not yet excluded ) , while model ( b ) is definitely ruled out .",
    "we also try to trace the origin of different claims by other authors .",
    "threefold maximal mixing is defined by a democratic mixing matrix : @xmath25 @xmath26 , so that all oscillation channels are open .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are assumed to drive atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations , respectively , so that @xmath20 can be assumed .",
    "the phenomenological implications of such model have been intensively studied by harrison , perkins , and scott ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    as far as atmospheric neutrinos are concerned",
    ", one can take @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( one mass scale dominance @xcite ) .",
    "since the mixing matrix elements ( squared ) are fixed to the common value 1/3 , the only parameter probed by sk data is @xmath23 . in the following ,",
    "we discuss how matter effects and fits to the sk and chooz data constrain the value of @xmath23 for threefold maximal mixing , and distinguish this scenario from twofold maximal mixing .",
    "the three - flavor oscillation probabilities for the case of @xmath29 and generic mixing can be found , e.g. , in appendix  c of ref .",
    "the specific case of threefold maximal mixing , obtained by taking @xmath30 and @xmath31 , leads to the well - known results for vacuum oscillations : @xmath32 where @xmath33 .    in the threefold maximal mixing scenario ( as well as in any model with large @xmath1 mixing ) atmospheric neutrino oscillations below the horizon",
    "are heavily affected by earth matter effects @xcite , as emphasized , e.g. , in @xcite , and recently realized also in @xcite .",
    "since the majority of upgoing leptons in sk are produced by neutrinos traversing only the earth mantle , the bulk of matter effects can be understood by assuming a constant electron density ( @xmath34 mol/@xmath35 ) along the neutrino trajectory . in this case , the flavor oscillation probabilities @xmath36 depend on the ( constant ) matter - induced squared mass term @xmath37 : @xmath38\\ , \\ ] ] and can be computed analytically .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath39 can be found in @xcite .",
    "two limit cases are particularly illuminating for understanding matter effects in threefold maximal mixing : low energy events ( @xmath40 ) and high energy events ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the regime @xmath40 corresponds ( for @xmath42 ev@xmath11 ) to @xmath43 gev , and is thus relevant for the so - called sub - gev ( sg ) atmospheric neutrino events . in this limit",
    "it turns out that @xcite @xmath44 where the term @xmath45 , for threefold maximal mixing , is given by : @xmath46 in the above equations , @xmath47 is the neutrino zenith angle ( @xmath48 ) , and the accidental equality @xmath49 for @xmath50 mol/@xmath35 has been used .",
    "it thus appears that , in the sub - gev sample , no significant matter effects can be expected for electron events , while the muon event rate should be further suppressed via the energy - independent term @xmath51 .",
    "this term is generated by the effective splitting in matter of the two vacuum - degenerate eigenstates @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the regime @xmath41 corresponds ( for @xmath42 ev@xmath11 ) to @xmath53 gev , and is thus relevant for the so - called upward through - going muon events ( up@xmath54 ) . in this limit",
    "it turns out that @xmath55 namely , threefold maximal mixing in matter becomes equivalent to twofold maximal mixing in vacuum @xcite , but with an effective squared mass difference decreased by a factor 2/3 : @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the above approximations are useful for a qualitative understanding of oscillations in matter , but can not be applied in the regime of intermediate energies [ @xmath57 gev ) ] , typical of the so - called multi - gev ( mg ) events .",
    "therefore , for numerical calculations we prefer to solve exactly , at any energy , the neutrino propagation equations along the earth density profile .",
    "details of our computation technique can be found in our previous works @xcite ; see , in particular , @xcite for sk observables .",
    "representative results of matter effects for threefold maximal mixing are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "figure  1 shows the sk distributions of sub - gev electrons and muons ( sg@xmath58 and sg@xmath54 ) , of multi - gev electrons and muons ( mg@xmath58 and mg@xmath54 ) and of upward - going muons ( up@xmath54 ) , as a function of the lepton zenith angle @xmath59 , for @xmath60 ev@xmath11 . in each bin ,",
    "the lepton rates are normalized to their expectations in the absence of oscillations .",
    "the sk data ( dots with error bars ) refer to 45 kty @xcite .",
    "the solid histograms ( blue in color ) represent the predictions of threefold maximal mixing including matter effects ; the dashed histograms ( red in color ) are obtained by assuming pure vacuum oscillations .",
    "as expected from the previous discussion , matter effects are negligible for the sg@xmath58 distribution , while they generate an additional suppression for the sg@xmath54 distribution .",
    "the up@xmath54 distribution is less `` tilted '' in the presence of matter oscillations , as a result of the smaller effective squared mass at high energy : @xmath61 . at `` intermediate energies '' ( mg events ) , both the @xmath58 and @xmath54 distributions are affected by oscillations in matter .",
    "it can be seen that matter effects help the fit to sg and mg data , but slightly worsen the fit to up@xmath54 data , as compared to pure vacuum oscillations .",
    "it has recently been claimed that , including matter effects , threefold maximal mixing with @xmath42 represents a good fit to all the sk data @xcite .",
    "although matter effects certainly help to fit the data in such model , the statements in @xcite seem too optimistic as compared with our detailed analysis of either 33 kty @xcite or 45 kty @xcite sk data , which disfavors scenarios with large values of @xmath62 , including threefold maximal mixing ( @xmath63 ) . in this section ,",
    "we clarify and further corroborate our previous results , and argue about the differences with the more optimistic claims in @xcite .",
    "figure  2 shows the sk distributions for threefold maximal mixing ( @xmath60 ev@xmath11 , matter effects included ) , as compared with the case of twofold maximal mixing @xmath2 ( at @xmath64 and @xmath65 ev@xmath11 ) .",
    "the differences among @xmath66 and @xmath67 distributions are relatively small for sg@xmath58 , sg@xmath54 , and mg@xmath58 events , while they are more significant for mg@xmath54 and up@xmath54 events .",
    "let us thus focus on the latter two samples .",
    "for mg@xmath54 , threefold maximal mixing overestimates the bin rate around the horizon @xmath68)$ ] , as compared to twofold maximal mixing .",
    "this effect has two components : ( i ) the relatively low value of @xmath23 implied by chooz for @xmath67 maximal mixing ( @xmath69 ev@xmath11 ) , with respect to the best - fit value for @xmath66 maximal mixing @xmath70 ev@xmath11 ; and ( ii ) the further `` matter '' suppression of @xmath23 by a factor 2/3 for the highest - energy part of the mg@xmath54 sample ( partially contained events ) .",
    "both components tend to increase the typical oscillation wavelength for @xmath67 maximal mixing ( as compared to the @xmath66 case ) , so that longer pathlengths are required to get effective muon suppression .",
    "data from sk rapidly drop at the horizon , and show no evidence ( within errors ) for a wavelength significantly longer than for the pure @xmath66 best - fit case at @xmath71 ev@xmath11 ; see fig .  3 in @xcite .",
    "] concerning up@xmath54 s one faces similar problems .",
    "threefold maximal mixing is unable to fit the slope suggested by the data pattern , both because @xmath23 is necessarily low , and because of the further effective 2/3 suppression of @xmath23 in matter . for up@xmath54 events ,",
    "threefold maximal mixing with @xmath60 ev@xmath11 is phenomenologically equivalent to twofold maximal mixing with @xmath72 ev@xmath11a value which is definitely below the 99% c.l .",
    "range allowed by up@xmath54 data alone ( see fig .  9 in @xcite ) .",
    "summarizing , fig .",
    "2 shows that @xmath66 and @xmath67 maximal mixing are discriminated mainly by mg@xmath54 and up@xmath54 data ; the low value of @xmath23 allowed by chooz for @xmath67 maximal mixing ( @xmath69 ev@xmath11 ) prevents a good fit to the mg@xmath54 rate around the horizon and to the slope of up@xmath54 s , in contrast to the very good fit provided with @xmath66 maximal mixing at @xmath42 ev@xmath11 .",
    "figure  3 shows @xmath73-fits to all the sk data ( sg+mg+up ) for twofold and threefold maximal mixing , as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "details of our statistical analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "the dot - dashed line ( black in color ) refers to the twofold maximal mixing , characterized by @xmath74 and @xmath75 ev@xmath11 at best fit .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath23 is in very good agreement with the sk official analysis ( compare with fig .  10 in @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed line ( red in color ) refers to threefold maximal mixing ( sk data only ) , which in principle could provide a good fit for @xmath76 ev@xmath11 , if such value were not excluded by chooz . adding the chooz constraint ( solid line , blue in color ) , the best fit is pushed to lower @xmath23 values and the value of @xmath77 increases up to @xmath78 .",
    "although this is not high enough to be ruled out , it is definitely worse than in the two - flavor case since , as observed in fig .  2",
    ", @xmath67 maximal mixing fails to fit the up@xmath54 and horizontal mg@xmath54 data",
    ". the situation would be even worse if matter effects were hypothetically switched off ( dotted line , green in color ) .",
    "the quantitative results of fig .  3 indicate that the two - flavor and three - flavor scenarios with maximal mixing differ by @xmath79 ; therefore , if @xmath67 mixing is left unconstrained , the minimum will fall close to the @xmath66 case with zero @xmath1 mixing , while @xmath67 cases with large @xmath1 mixing will be disfavored .",
    "this is indeed the pattern found in the @xmath67 parameter space analysis of @xcite .",
    "however , it should also be said that the @xmath67 maximal mixing fit to the sk data is not terribly bad , so it is wiser to wait for higher statistic in the mg@xmath54 and up@xmath54 samples , or for more stringent reactor bounds on @xmath23 , before ( dis)proving it definitely .",
    "we conclude by examining possible reasons for the more optimistic results found in @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite did not include up@xmath54 data , which contribute to worsen the fit for threefold maximal mixing . the work @xcite , moreover , considered only the up - down asymmetry for sg and mg data , thus excluding also the important information given by nearly horizontal mg@xmath54 .",
    "the comparison with @xcite is more delicate since , in principle , a data set similar to ours is analyzed .",
    "however , the lack of details and of explicit comparison with sk calculations in @xcite prevents us to trace the source of the differences . nevertheless , a comparison of our fig .  3 with the corresponding results in @xcite",
    "( see their fig .",
    "7 ) gives us some hints .",
    "it is quite evident that , for the two - flavor oscillation case , the preferred range for @xmath23 in @xcite is biased towards low values , as compared with our range in fig .  3 and with the sk official analysis ( fig .  10 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is surprising , since the authors of @xcite include also the old kamiokande data , which should rather pull the fit towards slightly higher @xmath23 values .",
    "a bias towards low @xmath23 s artificially increases the chance that threefold maximal mixing can survive below chooz bounds .    in conclusion ,",
    "we find that threefold maximal mixing is significantly disfavored with respect to twofold maximal mixing @xmath80 .",
    "the most discriminating data samples are mg@xmath54 and up@xmath54",
    ". however , further reactor data , and atmospheric neutrino data in the intermediate and high energy range , are needed in order to ( dis)prove the model with higher confidence .",
    "the super - kamiokande collaboration itself has now all the tools to investigate quantitatively generic three - flavor scenarios including matter effects @xcite , so as to settle definitely some differences existing among present independent phenomenological analyses .",
    "the sources of evidence for neutrino oscillations coming from solar and atmospheric neutrinos , as well as from the liquid scintillator neutrino detector experiment ( lsnd ) @xcite suggest three widely different neutrino mass square differences .",
    "therefore , they can not be reconciled in a single three - flavor scenario , unless some data are `` sacrificed '' @xcite .",
    "one possibility @xcite , indicated as `` case 3c '' in table  vi of ref .",
    "@xcite , has been recently revived in several works @xcite which claim that it can provide a good fit to the sk atmospheric neutrino data , and also explain most of the solar neutrino deficit and the lsnd data . in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss such scenario , and show quantitatively that it is ruled out by the sk atmospheric @xmath81 data .",
    "the starting hypothesis is that @xmath82 , so that : ( i ) concerning solar neutrinos , both @xmath24 and @xmath23 drive energy - averaged oscillations , which can explain the bulk of the solar neutrino deficit but not possible distortions in the energy spectrum ; ( ii ) for atmospheric neutrinos , @xmath24 drives the energy - dependent oscillations while @xmath23 gives an energy - averaged contribution ; and ( iii ) for lsnd , @xmath24 can be taken effectively equal to zero , and oscillations are driven by @xmath83 . in order to get the desired @xmath84 ,",
    "the heavy state @xmath85 is taken close to @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , so that @xmath52 are basically linear combinations of @xmath88 . by choosing nearly maximal mixing between @xmath89 and @xmath90 ,",
    "one then hopes to solve both the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the solar neutrino deficit through dominant @xmath91 oscillations driven by @xmath92 .",
    "the chooz results then constrain @xmath24 to range below @xmath93 ev@xmath11 .",
    "the mixing matrix for such scenario is rather strongly constrained by the requirement to fit solar , atmospheric , and lsnd data .",
    "indeed , the phenomenological matrices found in different works @xcite are similar to each other , with small differences which are not important for our discussion . for definiteness , we report the matrix @xmath15 found in the paper @xcite by thun and mckee : @xmath94 in the same work @xcite , the best - fit value of @xmath23 is 0.4 ev@xmath11 . such choice for the mass - mixing parameters will be dubbed `` the thun - mckee scenario . ''",
    "figure  4 shows the expected zenith distributions of lepton events in sk for the thun - mckee scenario at @xmath95 ev@xmath11 , with and without matter effects .",
    "matter effects play an important role in suppressing oscillations : when the @xmath88 mixing is ( nearly ) maximal in vacuum , it can only be smaller in matter . a similar pattern , in fact ,",
    "is found for pure two - flavor @xmath3 oscillations ( see fig .",
    "9 of @xcite ) .",
    "it can be seen in fig .  4 that the thun - mckee scenario is ruled out by the sk data for several reasons : ( i ) the sg@xmath58 and mg@xmath58 upgoing event rates are overestimated ; ( ii ) the sg@xmath54 and mg@xmath54 up - down asymmetries are largely underestimated ; ( iii ) the predicted up@xmath54 rate is too low ; and ( iv ) matter effects play an important role in worsening the fit",
    ". ratio of contained events .",
    "] the situation is not improved by lowering the value of @xmath23 , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "we find that the thun - mckee scenario , in any case , gives @xmath96 , and is thus definitely ruled out by the sk data _ alone_. in addition , the thun - mckee scenario does not provide a good fit to the current reactor and accelerator oscillation data , including lsnd , as already observed in @xcite . in fact , the quantitative three - flavor analysis of laboratory data performed in @xcite selects only two possible solutions at @xmath97 c.l . , namely , @xmath98 or @xmath99 , while @xmath100 is highly disfavored .    in conclusion , we find that the thun - mckee scenario is not a viable explanation of the solar+atmospheric+lsnd data .",
    "the sk data are sufficient to rule it out definitely .",
    "the much more optimistic claims in @xcite are not substantiated by quantitative calculations of electron and muon event rates in sk .",
    "we have made a detailed comparison of the sk atmospheric @xmath81 data with the predictions of two popular models characterized by large @xmath3 transitions : ( a ) threefold maximal mixing @xcite ; b ) three - flavor fits to solar , atmospheric , and lsnd data @xcite .",
    "we have found that model ( a ) @xcite is disfavored ( although not yet excluded ) , while model ( b ) @xcite is definitely ruled out .",
