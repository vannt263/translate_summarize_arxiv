    "as a promising mechanism of quark confinement , dual superconductivity picture of qcd vacuum has been intensively investigated up to today since the early proposal in 1970s @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of this picture is the existence of _ monopole condensation _ which causes the dual meissner effect . as a result",
    ", the color electric flux between quark and antiquark is squeezed to form the string",
    ". then the non - zero string tension plays the role of the proportional constant of the linear potential realizing quark confinement . for this picture to be true ,",
    "the monopole condensed vacuum is expected to give more stable vacuum than the perturbative one .    on the other hand ,",
    "savvidy @xcite has argued based on the general theory of the renormalization group that the _ spontaneous generation of color magnetic field _ should occur in yang - mills theory .",
    "however , nielsen and olesen @xcite have shown immediately that the explicitly calculated effective potential for the magnetic field in the background gauge has a pure imaginary part in addition to the real part which agrees with the prediction of the renormalization group equation .",
    "in other words , the savvidy vacuum with magnetic condensation is unstable due to the existence of the _ tachyon mode _ corresponding to the lowest landau level realized by the applied external color magnetic field .",
    "it should be remarked that the off - diagonal gluons were treated as if they were massless in these calculations .",
    "now we recall that the infrared ( ir ) abelian dominance @xcite and magnetic monopole dominance in the maximal abelian ( ma ) gauge were confirmed in 1990s by numerical simulations @xcite where the ma gauge is the same as the background gauge adopted in @xcite .",
    "the infrared abelian dominance @xcite follows from _ non - zero mass of off - diagonal gluons _ , see @xcite for numerical simulations and @xcite for analytical studies .",
    "the off - diagonal gluon mass should be understood as the dynamical mass or the spontaneously generated mass , since the original yang - mills lagrangian does not include the mass term .",
    "if sufficiently large dynamical mass is generated for off - diagonal gluons to compensate for the tachyon mode due to spontaneously generated magnetic field , therefore , the instability might disappear to recover the stability of the savvidy vacuum .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to clarify the physical origin of the dynamical mass for the off - diagonal gluons and thereby to obtain thorough understanding for the infrared abelian dominance and monopole dominance . in this connection , we discuss how the above two pictures ( dual superconductivity and magnetic condensation ) are compatible with each other in the gauge - independent manner .",
    "this issue is also related to how to treat the ir divergence originating from the massless gluons and the tachyon mode corresponding to the lowest landau level . in other words ,",
    "we examine whether a self - consistent picture can be drawn among magnetic condensation , massive off - diagonal gluons , abelian dominance , monopole dominance and stability of savvidy vacuum ( or disappearance of tachyon mode ) .    in this paper",

    "therefore , the off - diagonal gluon condensation yields the faddeev - skyrme model with knot solitons , based on intricate arguments .",
    "we do not need the procedure for taking the static limit . ]",
    "@xmath219 ^ 2    . \\ ] ] however , the systematic derivation of the off - diagonal gluon condensation is still lacking .",
    "the claim @xmath220 is also very suggestive for the existence of the faddeev - skyrme model .",
    "we have applied the cho - faddeev - niemi decomposition to the su(2 ) yang - mills theory and performed the brst quantization .",
    "first , we have pointed out that the magnetic condensation , @xmath84 , can provide the mass for the off - diagonal gluons .",
    "therefore the existence of the magnetic condensation enables us to explain the infrared abelian dominance which has been confirmed by numerical simulations in the last decade as a key concept for understanding the dual superconductivity .",
    "second , the magnetic condensation in question can occur if the other magnetic condensation takes place , i.e. , @xmath221 , based on a simple mathematical identity .",
    "third , we have explicitly calculated the effective potential of the color magnetic field @xmath222 in one - loop level .",
    "the resulting effective potential has a non - zero absolute minimum supporting the magnetic condensation @xmath84 .",
    "we have applied the change of variables to visualize the potential just as the higgs potential of the scalar field , apart from the savvidy instability .",
    "note that the magnetic condensation is not exactly equivalent to the monopole condensation .",
    "yet , two condensations are intimately connected to each other .",
    "in fact , a scenario for the off - diagonal gluons to acquire their mass for realizing the monopole condensation has already been demonstrated in @xcite where the physical origin of the off - diagonal gluon mass was not specified .",
    "therefore , _ monopole condensation as the origin of dual superconductivity follows from the magnetic condensation _",
    "@xmath84 , if we regard the resulting massiveness of the off - diagonal gluons .",
    "as the magnetic condensation is sufficient to provide the mass for off - diagonal gluons , the magnetic condensation and monopole condensation can give a self - consistent picture for supporting the dual superconductivity .",
    "however , the existence of the pure imaginary part in the effective potential @xmath119 was a signal of the savvidy instability which was discovered by nielsen and olesen @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the mass generation for off - diagonal gluons due to magnetic condensation modifies the calculation of the effective potential and eliminates the pure imaginary part corresponding to the tachyon mode .",
    "thus , the mass generation for off - diagonal gluons due to magnetic condensation recover the stability of the savvidy vacuum . to go beyond the one - loop calculation presented in this paper",
    ", we can introduce the antisymmetric auxiliary tensor field @xmath223 as in @xcite and include its condensation as an independent degrees of freedom to search for the true vacuum .",
    "this is also necessary to discuss the confining string @xcite .",
    "extension of the magnetic condensation to su(3 ) is also indispensable to discuss the realistic world .",
