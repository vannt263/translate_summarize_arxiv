    "linked cluster expansions ( lces ) have a long tradition in statistical physics . originally applied to classical fluids , later to magnetic systems ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and references therein ) , they were generalized to applications in particle physics in the eighties @xcite . there",
    "they have been used to study the continuum limit of a lattice @xmath10 field theory in 4 dimensions at zero temperature . in @xcite",
    "they were further generalized to field theories at finite temperature , simultaneously the highest order in the expansion parameter was increased to 18 . usually the analytic expansions are obtained as graphical expansions . because of the progress in computer facilities and the development of efficient algorithms for generating the graphs , it is nowadays possible to handle of the order of billions of graphs .",
    "the whole range from high temperatures down to the critical region becomes available , and thermodynamic quantities like critical indices and critical temperatures are determined with high precision ( the precision is comparable or even better than in corresponding high quality monte carlo results ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an extension of lces to a finite volume in combination with a high order in the expansion parameter turned out to be a particularly powerful tool for investigating the phase structure of systems with first and second order transitions by means of a finite size scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "linked cluster expansions are series expansions of the free energy and connected correlation functions about an ultralocal , decoupled theory in terms of a hopping parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding graphical representation is a sum in terms of connected graphs .",
    "the value of @xmath11 parametrizes the strength of interactions between fields at different lattice sites .",
    "usually they are chosen as nearest neighbours .",
    "in contrast to the ultralocal terms of a generic interaction we will sometimes refer to hopping terms as non - ultralocal .    in this paper we develop dynamical linked cluster expansions ( dlces ) . these are linked cluster expansions with hopping parameter terms that are endowed with their own dynamics .",
    "such systems are realized in spin glasses with ( fast ) spins and ( slow ) interactions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they also occur in variational estimates for su(n)-gauge - higgs systems , cf .",
    "@xcite . like lces",
    "they are expected to converge for a large class of interactions .",
    "formally dlces amount to a generalization of an expansion scheme from 2-point to point - link - point - interactions .",
    "these are interactions between fields associated with two points and with one pair of points called link .",
    "the points and links are not necessarily embedded on a lattice , and the links need not be restricted to nearest neighbours .",
    "we have developed a new theory in which a generalized notion of connectivity plays a central role .",
    "standard notions of equivalence classes of graphs like 1-line irreducible and 1-vertex irreducible graphs have been generalized , and new notions like 1-multiple - line irreducible graphs were defined in order to give a systematic classification .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 we specify the models that admit a dlce .",
    "we introduce and explain the idea behind the abstract notions of theory .",
    "detailed definitions of , related notions and the computation of weights are given in sect .",
    "4 treats the issue of renormalization in the sense of suitable resummations of graphs .",
    "applications to spin glasses are presented in sect .",
    "there it is of particular interest that dlces allow for the possibility of avoiding the replica trick . in the quenched limit",
    "we derive that dlces must be restricted to a subclass of the corresponding graphical expansion , so - called quenched dlces ( qdlces ) .",
    "we also list some examples for models whose phase structure is accessible to qdlces . to these belongs in particular the bond diluted ising model .",
    "6 contains the summary and conclusions .",

    "it looks much like the series representation of the @xmath102-replica system , which is given by [ sg.w1series ] w_1-repl = _ l0 ( 2k)^l _ _ 0,0(l ) w ( ) according to the discussion of section 2 .",
    "we recall that @xmath203 is the set of dlce vacuum graphs with @xmath122 bare lines that are connected in the generalized dlce sense . comparing ( [ sg.wseries ] ) and ( [ sg.w1series ] ) , the transition from @xmath168 to @xmath1 replicas is achieved by keeping only the subset @xmath213 of that are connected in the original ( lce ) sense .",
    "we emphasize that the restriction of dlces to qdlces is not an ad hoc ( or intuitively motivated ) assumption but a derived consequence of the fact that the logarithm is taken before the integration @xmath160 .",
    "this procedure accounts for _ all _ graphs that contribute to a given order in @xmath11 .",
    "thus we do have to truncate the series unless the series can be completely summed up , as it happens in exceptional cases .",
    "we expect that the series ( [ sg.wseries ] ) are convergent for a large class of interactions @xmath214 and @xmath36 if the coupling constant @xmath11 is sufficiently small . for special interactions",
    "most of the yield vanishing contributions so that we can further restrict the sum to a subset of @xmath215 .",
    "an example is given by the mean field type of interaction of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , cf .",
    "sect .  5.2 .      in the following we list some examples for systems of which we can study the phase structure by means of qdlces .",
    "their actions are special cases of ( [ neur.hop])-([neur.site ] ) with @xmath168 ( as explained above ) and the following choice of variables .",
    "* infinite range models .",
    "choose @xmath216 as before , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , v(x , y ) & = & k ( 1-_x , y ) , + _ 1 & & _ 1 + s^1(j ) & = & n j^2 .",
    "now the sum over the sites in ( [ neur.hop ] ) runs over arbitrary pairs @xmath149 , @xmath219 , and we obtain the infinite range sherrington - kirkpatrick model . for infinte range and in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath220 ) , the phase structure can be solved by replica mean field theory , cf .  e.g.  @xcite . for qdlces",
    "the infinite range and @xmath220 limits imply that only tree graphs of 2-lines contribute to the series of the free energy density , such as & & + & & +   + & & + ( 15.0,15.0 ) +   + & & + & & the reason for that is that each 2-line gets a factor of @xmath221 from the @xmath222-part of the action , but each vertex gets a factor @xmath223 from the embedding onto a lattice @xmath12 .",
    "the contribution of every tree graph to the free energy is proportional to @xmath150 .",
    "if a chain of 2-lines connecting the vertices gets closed , forming a loop , there is one @xmath223 less in the total embedding factor .",
    "thus the contribution is suppressed by @xmath224 for every loop and vanishes in the thermodynamic limit . because of the simple tree structure there is a chance for summing up the series .",
    "this is currently under investigation . *",
    "finite range connectivity .",
    "the sum @xmath225 of the spins is now restricted to next - neighbours or , more generally , to a finite number of pairs . rather than specifying @xmath226 of ( [ neur.link ] ) ,",
    "it is sufficient for dlces and qdlces to choose @xmath227 . let exp(-s_1(j ) ) = ( 1-p ) ( j ) + p ( j-1 ) with @xmath228 $ ] .",
    "the variables @xmath229 can then be interpreted as occupation numbers of the bonds .",
    "furthermore , if we choose @xmath230 we obtain a * * bond - diluted ising model .",
    "+ choosing @xmath231 we obtain a * * bond - diluted @xmath232-state potts model .",
    "+ if @xmath233 , we obtain a * * bond - diluted heisenberg model .",
    "qdlces provide a systematic analytic expansion for disordered systems with bond dilution in a quenched limit . coming from the high temperature ( small @xmath147 ) region one can study the phase structure as a function of the degree of dilution . work in this direction",
    "is in progress .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a new expansion scheme for 3-point interactions or , more precisely , for point - link - point interactions .",
    "this scheme generalizes linked cluster expansions for 2-point interactions by including hopping parameter terms endowed with their own dynamics . in chapters 3 - 4 we have developed a theory with an additional new type of multiple - line connectivity .",
    "we have introduced appropriate equivalence classes of graphs and discussed the issue of renormalization .",
    "these notions are required for an algorithmic generation of graphs . because of the fast proliferation of graphs already at low orders in the expansion , a computer aided implementation becomes unavoidable , if one is interested in higher orders of the expansion than we have computed so far .    in sect .",
    "5 we have shown how to avoid the replica trick for calculating the free energy of disordered systems in the quenched limit .",
    "dlces are a systematic expansion method to study the phase structure of disordered systems .",
    "it is systematic in the sense that we do not restrict the expansion to certain subclasses of graphs that can be summed up , but we identify and keep _ all _ graphs that contribute to a given order in the expansion parameter .",
    "dlces provide an analytic tool for studying systems in situations in which it has been impossible so far .",
