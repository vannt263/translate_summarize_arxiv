    "ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at future collider energies of bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) are expected to reveal novel qcd dynamics not accessible at present fixed target energies .",
    "when the transverse momentum transfer involved in each nucleon - nucleon collision is small , @xmath0 , effective models based on meson - exchange and resonance formation are sufficient to describe multiple interaction between hadrons .",
    "those interactions lead to collective behavior in low energy heavy ion collisions as first observed in bevalac experiments@xcite and recently at ags energies@xcite .",
    "when @xmath1 becomes large enough to resolve individual partons inside a nucleon , the dynamics is best described on the parton level via perturbative qcd .",
    "though hard parton interactions occur at cern - sps energies ( @xmath2 agev ) , they play a negligible role in the global features of heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , at collider energies ( @xmath3 agev ) the importance of hard or semihard parton scatterings is clearly seen in high - energy @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions @xcite .",
    "they are therefore also expected to be dominant in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies @xcite .    since hard parton scatterings occur very early ( @xmath6 fm / c ) and their rates are calculable via perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , we proposed in @xcite that high @xmath1 parton jets could serve as a unique probe of the quark - gluon plasma formed due to copious mini - jet production over longer time scales ( @xmath7 fm / c ) .",
    "the systematics of jet quenching provides information on the stopping power , @xmath8 , of high energy partons in dense matter@xcite .",
    "the stopping power is in turn controlled by the color screening scale , @xmath9 , in the medium .",
    "thus , jets provide information on that interesting dynamical scale in deconfined matter . at very high energy densities ,",
    "that scale is expected to be large compared to confinement scale@xcite . at temperatures , @xmath10 ,",
    "for example , we expect @xmath11 . in that case , most partonic interactions have high momentum transfers and perturbative qcd methods may apply to the calculation of multiple collision amplitudes .    in ref.@xcite",
    "a systematic study of qcd multiple collision theory was initiated with the aim of deriving the non - abelian analog of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect .",
    "that effect , first derived in the case of qed@xcite long ago , involves the destructive interference between bremsstrahlung radiation amplitudes .",
    "it suppresses radiation relative to the bethe - heitler formula in kinematic regions where the radiation formation time is long compared to the mean free path . in qcd a similar effect is also expected because it mainly follows from general relativistic uncertainty principle arguments .",
    "however , we showed in @xcite that specific non - abelian effects influence the detailed interference pattern in the case of qcd .",
    "the lpm effect in qcd is especially important for estimating the energy loss , @xmath8 , of an energetic parton traversing a dense qcd medium .",
    "we note that there exists considerable controversy in the literature on the magnitude and energy dependence of the energy loss in qcd @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend our derivation in @xcite to clarify further this effect and improve our previous estimates of @xmath8 .    in the next section ,",
    "we consider in detail the problem of induced gluon radiation from a spin 1/2 quark suffering two elastic scatterings .",
    "this provides an insight into the applicability of the effective potential model used in ref .",

    "we show why radiation from the target partons is negligible although such amplitudes are absolutely necessary to ensure gauge invariance . on the other hand",
    ", gauge invariance constrains all gluon propagators to be regulated by the same screening mass in the potential model . in section 3",
    ", the qcd radiation interference pattern is shown to be expressible as a function of an effective formation time that depends on the color representation of the jet parton . in section 4 ,",
    "that formation time is used to calculate the average radiative energy loss @xmath8 and derive a simple formula that interpolates between the factorization and bethe - heitler limits as a function of a dimensionless ratio depending on the incident parton energy @xmath12 , the screening scale and the mean free path . finally , section 5 contains a summary and closing remarks .",

    "consider the scattering of a high energy jet parton in a color neutral quark - gluon plasma .",

    "the total energy loss for a propagating quark is @xmath204 gev / fm . only about 25% of this amount comes from elastic energy loss .",

    "the dependence of this effective formation time on the color representation of the jet parton gave rise to the different color factors , proportional to @xmath201 , for the radiative energy loss of a quark and gluon .",
    "in contrast both are proportional to @xmath124 in the case of a single scattering .",
    "secondly , the gluon spectrum including radiation from both the jet line and the internal gluon line and regulated consistently with the requirement of gauge invariance was used",
    ". however , eq . ( [ eq : dedz1 ] ) is still an idealization to the physically realizable situation in nuclear collisions because a number of strong assumptions were made in its derivation .",
    "the strongest is the extrapolation of pqcd in a regime @xmath206 and the assumption that the interaction range is small compared to the color relaxation mean free path .",
    "we have therefore left with an explicit dependence on @xmath9 in @xmath8 since strong nonperturbative variations of @xmath207 occur in the vicinity of @xmath208 . the basic result that @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath44 is however very general and consistent with the uncertainty bounds in@xcite .",
    "therefore , in a separate paper @xcite , we will investigate the phenomenological consequences of interesting temperature dependence of @xmath207 suggested by lattice calculations .",
