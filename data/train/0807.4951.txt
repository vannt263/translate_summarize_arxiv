    "recently , superconductivity has been discovered in a number of compounds lacking inversion symmetry , such as cept@xmath1si ( ref . ) , uir ( ref . ) , cerhsi@xmath1 ( ref . ) , ceirsi@xmath1 ( ref . ) , li@xmath2(pd@xmath3pt@xmath4)b ( ref . ) , and many others .",
    "much of the theoretical work in the field has focussed on searching for the features which are specific to noncentrosymmetric systems .",
    "these include the magnetoelectric effect,@xcite a large residual spin susceptibility and reduced paramagnetic limiting , @xcite and various novel nonuniform superconducting states.@xcite    in this paper we study the effects of the absence of inversion symmetry on the upper critical field , @xmath0 , at arbitrary temperature .",
    "we assume the pairing to be of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) type , and include only the orbital pair breaking .",
    "the main qualitative difference from the centrosymmetric case is that the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling of electrons with the crystal lattice changes the nature of single - electron states , lifting spin degeneracy of the energy bands .",
    "then even scalar impurities can mix the singlet and triplet channels in the cooper pair propagator , thus making the theory considerably more complicated .",
    "the derivation of the @xmath5 equations for arbitrary noncentrosymmetric crystal symmetry is presented in sec . [",

    "this isotropic model clearly shows the deviations from the usual , i.e. centrosymmetric bcs , case , for which the upper critical field was calculated in the classic papers by helfand , werthamer , and hohenberg in 1960s ( refs . ) .",

    "the magnetic phase diagram of noncentrosymmetric superconductors has been discussed previously in several works .",

    "two - dimensional case , in which only the paramagnetic pair breaking is present , was considered in ref . .",
    "recently , @xmath5 at all temperatures was calculated in ref . , neglecting the impurity - induced triplet channel in the pair propagator in the limit when the so band splitting is small compared with the fermi energy . in this paper , we relax this last condition and include both the singlet and triplet channels .    throughout the paper",
