    "most fibers use core and cladding materials with nearly the same refractive indices .",
    "such fibers are referred to as weakly guiding fibers .",
    "the description of weakly guiding fibers is greatly simplified due to the use of the linearly polarized ( lp ) modes , which are approximate solutions of maxwell s equations and are superpositions of two corresponding nearly degenerate eigenmodes .",
    "recently , thin waveguides have become attractive for a wide range of potential practical applications .",
    "it has been pointed out that the intense evanescent field in the vicinity of a tapered fiber can be used as an atomic mirror @xcite .",

    "the evanescent waves from zero - mode metal - clad subwavelength - diameter waveguides have been used for optical observations of single - molecule dynamics @xcite .",
    "several types of dielectric submicrometer- and nanometer - diameter wire waveguides have been fabricated , and their guiding properties have been investigated @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed to use the optical force of an evanescent wave around a thin fiber for atom trapping and guiding @xcite .",
    "thin fiber structures can be used as building blocks in the future micro- and nano - photonic devices .",
    "unlike the case of optical fibers with diameter larger than the wavelength , many properties of subwavelength - diameter fibers have not been adequately investigated .",
    "in such a thin fiber , the original silica core is vanishing .",
    "therefore , the original silica clad acts like a core while the surrounding vacuum ( or air ) acts like a clad . due to the high refractive - index contrast between the silica core and the vacuum clad ,",
    "the description of subwavelength - diameter fibers in terms of weakly guided lp modes is questionable .",
    "it has been demonstrated that such fibers have interesting properties such as high power density at the fiber surface and cylindrical asymmetry in the field distribution @xcite , large penetration length of the evanescent wave @xcite , enhancement of the power fraction of the field outside the fiber @xcite , and large waveguide dispersion @xcite .",
    "however , the intensity distributions and polarization orientations of the fields in subwavelength - diameter fibers have not been studied .    in this paper",
    "we study the field intensity distributions and polarization orientations in the fundamental mode he@xmath0 of a vacuum - clad _ subwavelength - diameter _ optical fiber using the _ exact _ solutions of maxwell s equations .",
    "we show that the thin thickness of the fiber and the high contrast between the refractive indices of the silica core and the vacuum clad substantially modify the intensity distributions and the polarization orientations of the field and its components .",
    "the study of such properties is necessary not only for academic interest but also for practical applications such as trapping of atoms by the optical force of an evanescent wave around a thin fiber @xcite .",
    "before we proceed , we note that , in related problems , the decay of an atom in the presence of a fiber was considered for the first time by katsenelenbaum in 1949 @xcite .",
    "excitation of fiber modes with a dipole source and influence of a fiber on the decay rate of a single atom were investigated in @xcite . in the present paper",

    "as seen , the field intensity distributions inside ( @xmath152 ) and outside ( @xmath153 ) the fiber have very different behaviors . due to the boundary condition and the high contrast between the refractive indices of the silica core and the vacuum clad",

    "[ fig11](a ) and [ fig11](b ) show that , inside the fiber , @xmath57 and @xmath107 are almost equal to each other and practically do not vary with @xmath44 .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath44-dependent terms in the expressions for @xmath154 and @xmath155 in eqs .",

    "[ fig11](a ) and [ fig11](b ) shows that the azimuthal dependences of @xmath57 and @xmath107 outside the fiber reduce with increasing @xmath97 .",
    "the terms @xmath161 in eqs .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) lead to @xmath162 and , hence , to @xmath163 .",
    "due to the substantial difference between @xmath164 and @xmath165 in the outer vicinity of the fiber surface , the polarization of the transverse component @xmath111 of the field in this region is truly elliptical .",
    "we recall that the axes of the elliptical circulation orbit are aligned along the unit vectors @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "we also recall that the lengths of the axes of the ellipse are equal to @xmath133 and @xmath134 . hence",
    ", the ellipticity of the orbit is proportional to the factor @xmath166 .",
    "this factor reduces with increasing @xmath97 .",
    "thus both the orientation and the ellipticity of the orbit of polarization circulation vary in space .",
    "this behavior is different from the case of conventional light beams with elliptical or circular polarization .",
    "furthermore , we note that the ellipticity of the orbit of polarization circulation does not depend on @xmath44 .",
    "this indicates that the orbit rotates circularly in space .",
    "figures [ fig10](c ) and [ fig11](c ) show that the longitudinal - component intensity @xmath108 is perfectly cylindrically symmetric , as expected , in the whole cross - section plane .",
    "although @xmath108 is small compared to @xmath57 and @xmath107 , it is not negligible in the vicinity of the fiber surface .",

    "we have shown that the thin thickness of the fiber and the high contrast between the refractive indices of the silica core and the vacuum clad substantially modify the intensity distributions and the polarization properties of the field and its components , especially in the vicinity of the fiber surface .",
    "we have examined the case of a fundamental mode with quasi - linear polarization .",
    "we have shown that a substantial azimuthal dependence of the total intensity is observed in the vicinity of the fiber surface .",
    "the transverse component of the field is linearly polarized in time at each fixed local point .",
    "however , the total electric field vector rotates elliptically with time , in a plane parallel to the fiber axis . inside the fiber ,",
    "the transverse component is not only linearly polarized in time but also almost linearly polarized in space .",
    "outside the fiber , the orientation angle of the transverse component of the field varies in space .",
    "we have also studied the case of a fundamental mode with rotating ( circulating ) polarization .",
    "we have shown that the total intensity is azimuthally independent , that is , is cylindrically symmetric .",
    "we have found that the total intensity of the electric field outside the fiber decays faster than that of the approximate mode lp@xmath1 .",
    "the difference between the exact and approximate modes is relatively small in the case of rotating polarization .",
    "consequently , the underlying physics of the optical potential of the evanescent wave around a vacuum - clad subwavelength - diameter fiber is basically the same as that of the approximate mode lp@xmath1 .",
    "however , the magnitude of the difference is not negligible in the vicinity of the fiber surface . therefore , the use of the exact solutions of maxwell s equations is required in a systematic quantitative treatment for a thin fiber .",
    "we have shown that , inside the fiber , the total transverse component of the field is almost circularly polarized . in the outer vicinity of the fiber surface , the polarization of the transverse component of the field is elliptical . in this region ,",
    "the orientation of the orbit of polarization circulation rotates in space while the ellipticity of the orbit reduces with increasing radial distance .",
    "this is different from the case of conventional light beams with elliptical or circular polarization .",
    "our results are helpful for studying and developing new miniaturized high - performance photonic devices .",
    "one of the promising applications of the field around the subwavelength - diameter fiber is trapping and guiding of neutral atoms by the optical force of the evanescent field .",
