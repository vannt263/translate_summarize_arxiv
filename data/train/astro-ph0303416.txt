    "the universe is full of large gaseous baryonic structures such as galaxies and clusters .",
    "these structures are observed to take on a variety of shapes ranging from disks to spherical configurations .",
    "the radial profiles of these structures have been observed to be rather non - trivial , e.g. changing from one power - law profile near the centre to another power - law profile at large radii . even though these baryonic configurations have been observed and studied for many years",
    ", there is surprisingly little theoretical guidance to understand the origin of such complexity .",
    "astronomers have for years been using phenomenological profiles , ones with differing inner and outer shape , however , no simple theoretical explanation for this structure exists . in recent years numerical analyses have improved enormously , and we can now simulate much of the structures we observe . never the less , it is important to have a simple understanding of the underlying physics , which can be obtained most easily through analytical studies of the basic equations .    in this letter",
    "we attempt an analytical treatment of the basic equations , asking which density profiles are expected of purely gaseous baryonic structures , and which profiles lead to stable baryonic structures within dark matter halos .",
    "we address these questions by considering a fluid approach whereby we analyse asymptotic stable solutions of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "this approach is new in astrophysics and surprisingly simple .",
    "our main results are , that the density profile of gaseous baryonic structures is fairly complex , namely that the radial density profile may have different slopes in the inner and outer regions .",
    "this is an issue which has been much discussed for dark matter profiles , but which has not been understood previously for baryonic structures .",
    "we find that spheres and disks are the only possible solutions . from an observational point of view",
    "it seems obvious that these are possible solutions , and while the creation of disks is understood theoretically , the fact that no other solutions are stable is non - trivial . as a byproduct of our analysis",
    "we show how one can infer the dm density profile purely by observing the baryonic density profile .",
    "we also analyse how a central massive black hole influences the solutions .",
    "the behaviour of any collisional gas or fluid is fully determined by the navier - stokes ( n - s ) equations , which are 3 hydrodynamical equations for the velocity vector , and a continuity equation . in the following",
    "we will make several assumptions , which certainly limits the applicability of our results , however , the solutions we find should be valid for the description of general properties of structures such as gaseous baryonic galaxies and haloes .",
    "the main assumption is that there are sufficient collisions while the structure forms .",
    "thus if a gaseous baryonic structure has formed and subsequently all the baryons condense into stars , then the star density profile should still approximately follow the original density profile .",
    "baryons often have sufficient collisions to equilibrate , e.g. in a typical intra - cluster gas the equilibration timescale is about @xmath4 yrs , with mean free path of tens of kpc compared to radii of few mpc .",
    "we do not expect that our findings should apply to dark matter structures , since dark matter presumably does not have sufficient collisions to ensure the validity of the n - s equations .",
    "in spherical coordinates the n - s equations describe the velocity vector @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the radial coordinate , @xmath7 is the angle in the @xmath8-plane , and @xmath9 is the angle from the @xmath10-axis .",
    "the form of the equations is well known , see e.g.  @xcite , and contains time - derivatives , pressure terms , viscosity terms and a gravitational term .",
    "our first 2 assumption are , that the gas has reached a stable configuration ( no time - derivative ) , and that it has picked out an orientation in space , in such a way that all the gas is moving only in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "thus we have @xmath11 ( no contraction or expansion ) , and @xmath12 . here",
    "one must keep in mind , that by considering the n - s equations we are taking a fluid approach , which implies that we are following a fluid element , and this basically corresponds to averaging over all the particles moving through the fluid element . for the @xmath7-velocity we consider the general form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants to be determined , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are unknown constants , with the physical interpretation that @xmath17 is a characteristic radius , and @xmath16 is the velocity of the fluid element at that radius .",
    "the @xmath18-equation becomes very simple with the assumed form of the velocities @xmath19 \\ , , \\label{eq : vis}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the scalar laplacian , and @xmath21 is the kinematic viscosity . for",
    "now all that matters is the existence of a non - zero viscosity , so the absolute magnitude ( and even radial dependence ) is not important for the results  @xcite , where the dimension @xmath22 is the size of the turbulent eddies , and @xmath23 is the velocity dispersion . ] .",
    "when we use the form for @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) , then equation  ( [ eq : vis ] ) has 4 solutions @xmath24    the solution with @xmath25 is exactly what one should expect for spherical symmetry , and we will refer to these solutions as the _ spherical solutions_. the solutions with",
    "@xmath26 indicate unstable solutions everywhere except in the flat cylinder where @xmath27 , and we will refer to these as _",
    "solutions_. we thus see that both spherical and disk solutions exist , and that they have different rotational structure ( different @xmath14 ) .",
    "now , looking at eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) , it is clear , that the solutions with negative @xmath14 are divergent for @xmath28 , and we will therefore refer to those solutions as _",
    "solutions _ , and similarly , the solutions with positive @xmath14 are inconsistent for large radii , and we will refer to those as _",
    "inner solutions_.    there are several obvious extensions of the method described here .",
    "one could in particular allow for a general @xmath7-dependence in @xmath18 , a non - zero radial velocity , or an exponential radial dependence of velocities and density profile   dependence in @xmath18 as @xmath29 , with @xmath30 the number of spiral arms , gives @xmath31 for all @xmath30 .",
    "allowing for a non - zero radial velocity , @xmath32 , gives @xmath33 . ] .",
    "already from this one sees that a spherical solution , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : plus ] ) , must have different radial structure for the inner and outer solutions ( because the only solutions are @xmath34 ) , and hence one may expect to find different density profiles in the central and outer regions .",
    "we point out that such phenomenon of simultaneous existence of two flow patterns is rather common in hydrodynamics , the simplest may be the hydraulic jump which is observed as a several centimetre large circular ring in any kitchen sink , when the flowing water goes from a @xmath35 profile to a constant , see @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that a non - zero viscosity appears to be a necessary condition for the existence of these specific solutions , even though a fundamental understanding of how the microscopic physics ( viscosity ) can determine the macroscopic properties ( the general flow pattern ) is still generally missing in hydrodynamics .      from the @xmath7-equation",
    ", we identified the general flow pattern , and we noticed the possibility that one may have different velocity - flows in the inner and outer region .",
    "we will now use the @xmath36-equation to try to extract the asymptotic radial density profiles .",
    "also the @xmath6-equation is very simple @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the radially dependent density , @xmath39 is the pressure , @xmath40 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath41 is the mass within the radius @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the pressure and density are related through @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the unknown pressure and density at @xmath17 .",
    "we assume the gas is monatomic with @xmath45 .",
    "let us consider densities of the form @xmath46 such that the parameter @xmath47 determines the density profile .",
    "it is worth emphasising that it is exactly this @xmath47 which we are trying to find .",
    "let us study the radial dependence of the 3 terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr ] ) . using @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) the first ( kinetic ) term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr ] ) goes like @xmath48 .",
    "the pressure gradient term goes like @xmath49 , where we have used @xmath50 .",
    "the last ( gravitational ) term including @xmath41 , depends on the given system we are considering .",
    "if the mass is dominated by a point gravitational source ( e.g. a central black hole ) , then it goes like @xmath51 .",
    "if the mass is dominated by the matter density , then it goes like @xmath52 , with @xmath53 the volume element . for spherical solutions",
    "this gravitational term thus goes like @xmath54 with @xmath47 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) , and for disk solutions it goes like @xmath55 .",
    "this gravitational term has the correct form for spherical distributions ( and point sources ) , but is only an approximation for the pure disk case . technically speaking the mass is logarithmic divergent for spherical structures with @xmath56 , however , the formula @xmath57 holds for any @xmath47 arbitrarily close to @xmath58 , and furthermore in a real situation there would be an outer cut - off . to be explicit",
    ", we are looking for solutions to an equation of the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 for spherical , disk and bh matter dominance respectively .",
    "when we use the word solve in the following , we are really just using the standard method of divergence cancellation , in the sense that the most divergent terms must cancel with each other .",
    "the optimal case is naturally that all divergences disappear , a case which we will refer to as _",
    "good_. from our simple analysis the transition radius , @xmath17 , which separates the inner from outer region , is not uniquely determined .",
    "we only find approximate disk relations like @xmath61 . a full study including the coefficient is significantly more involved , and we will leave that for a later analysis   term is negligible this eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr ] ) is exactly the hydrostatic equilibrium , which is often written as @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , in the same notation one finds that the velocity dispersion , @xmath63 , has a radial dependence , @xmath64 . ] .",
    "we want to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr ] ) for the profile parameter @xmath47 , however , there are 4 situations to consider ( the 4 different @xmath14 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : plus],[eq : minus ] ) ) , and for each case we can choose which is the dominating mass contribution , either from a sphere , from a disk or from a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "the discussion in sections 2.3 and 2.4 is somewhat technical , and the reader is encouraged to look at figs .  1 and 2 , which summarize the main findings of these sections .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath65 case , which can be both an inner and outer solution .",
    "for the inner solution we find two density profiles , @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 solution is more natural , because the first two divergent terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr ] ) ( or similarly eq .  ( [ eq : simpel ] ) ) can cancel , and the last term is non - divergent for @xmath28 , whereas for the @xmath68 solution , the two most divergent terms cancel , but the remaining term is still slightly divergent towards the centre . with this kind of argument",
    "one can divide all the solutions into _ good _ , and _",
    "reasonable _ solutions , and we will emphasise which are _ good _ solutions . if the mass is dominated by a bh , then the solution is @xmath69 .",
    "if the disk is dominated by a spherical distribution ( either from a large fraction of the baryons , or from an unknown dark matter component ) with profile @xmath70 , then the solution is @xmath71 . in conclusion",
    "we see , that the only good solution for the inner disk is @xmath67 . in principle the @xmath65 case",
    "can also be an outer solution . in that case",
    "the solution is @xmath72 . if the mass is dominated by a bh , then @xmath73 ( good ) , and if dominated by a spherical distribution then @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath75 ( which is an outer solution ) gives @xmath56 ( good ) .",
    "if a bh dominates then @xmath76 , and if another spherical component dominates ( with profile @xmath70 ) then @xmath77 , where the case @xmath56 is the only good solution .",
    "we summarize the good disk solutions in figure 1 .    to conclude the disk solutions , when the mass is dominated by the matter itself ,",
    "then there is only 1 good configuration ( we emphasise that by good we mean optimal removal of divergences ) , which has the inner slope of @xmath67 and outer slope of @xmath56 . following the similarity with the hydraulic jump in the kitchen sink , we will refer to such configuration as a galactic hydraulic drop .",
    "for the sphere it turns out that almost all the solutions are good , in the sense that all the divergences cancel in a simple manner .",
    "the @xmath78 is the inner solution , for which we find @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath80 is obviously strange , and probably non - physical ( a positive @xmath47 would lead to a wrong sign in front of the pressure gradient term ) . with bh dominance one",
    "has @xmath81 , and if dominated by a disk ( which could either be from a fraction of the same gas , or from another particle type ) with profile @xmath82 one finds @xmath83 . if dominated by another spherical distribution ( which probably should arise from another particle type ) with profile @xmath84 , then we find @xmath85 .    the outer solution , @xmath86 gives @xmath87 .",
    "if a bh dominates then @xmath81 , and again if a disk ( or sphere ) dominates then @xmath83 ( or @xmath88 .",
    "we summarize the good spherical solutions in figure 2 .",
    "we note that if the mass is disk dominated with disk - profile @xmath89 , then the sphere happens to also get the profile @xmath90 .",
    "thus one can envisage a significant fraction of the matter collapsing to a disk , which very well could take the profile @xmath91 ( as shown in section  [ sec : disk ] ) , and this would force the remaining matter , which is in a spherical configuration , to take the density profile @xmath90",
    ". we also point out that if the mass is dominated by a dark matter sphere , then the baryon profile becomes @xmath76 for a dark matter profile @xmath92 as suggested by dark matter n - body simulations .",
    "if instead the dominating dm profile is @xmath93 , this would seemingly imply a positive baryonic slope , which is difficult to interpret .",
    "we feel that this limited applicability warns , that a more general calculation may provide a different connection between the dm and gaseous baryonic profiles",
    "an interesting possibility now appears , namely that one can use our results to infer the dark matter profiles from observations of the baryonic profile .",
    "this method can be used quite generally to infer the dm distribution , and is therefore complementary to other methods such as lensing observations .",
    "let us say we have observed a baryonic sphere with profile @xmath94 , and we know that the mass is dark matter dominated . under the assumption that the dm is spherical we have @xmath95 .",
    "thus , if we observe e.g. @xmath96 , then we know , that the dm has profile @xmath97 . determining the baryonic density profile",
    "directly , i.e. independent of dynamics , can be accomplished in several ways :    \\1 ) x - rays : observations of the luminosity , @xmath98 , in various bands and in different radial bins gives the radial electron density of the plasma . here",
    "the main concern is the validity of hydrostatic equilibrium and disentangling any cooling flow in the centre of the cluster .",
    "relaxed clusters with no evidence of cooling flows do exist , for example a2029 ( see figure  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the gas in this cluster shows an inner profile @xmath99 and an outer @xmath100 ( note our differing definition of @xmath47 here ) .",
    "the outer value is certainly dm dominated and our analysis implies that @xmath101 is very close to @xmath58 , which is expected from cdm simulations @xcite .",
    "we do not attempt to deduce the inner dm slope here , because one can not be certain that the mass is dm dominated at such small radii where the baryonic slope should reach its asymptotic value .",
    "again we refer to the warning in the end of section  [ sec : sphere ] .",
    "\\2 ) the sunyaev - zeldovich effect is in principle a direct measure of the plasma column density .",
    "the angular resolution required for our analysis currently limits the use of this technique , however , future multi - frequency observations will determine independently both the temperature and number density profile of distant clusters purely through the s - z effect  @xcite .",
    "the sz - effect can thus be used to measure the electron density profile to large radii ( sz effect is proportional to @xmath102 , whereas x - ray is proportional to @xmath103 ) and at large redshift ( sz is redshift independent ) .",
    "\\3 ) surface brightness : both from stellar light and radio observations of hi and molecular gas , one can in principle determine the baryon profile . an example is for m33 by @xcite .    the distribution near black holes has been considered earlier . first by  @xcite where energy consideration lead to the distribution @xmath104 , which was refined in  @xcite who found @xmath105 .",
    "later numerical simulations have shown @xcite that the profile near the black hole should be @xmath3 , which is just what we find . for accreting black holes this profile may be different @xcite .",
    "we make a first attempt to derive analytically the asymptotic density profiles of baryonic structure in cosmology , which include galaxies , gaseous haloes and intra - clusters gas .",
    "we find that both disks and spherical solutions exist , and that generally the inner and outer density profile may be different .",
    "thus we supply theoretical support for the use of phenomenological profiles like @xmath106 for the disks we identify central cores with @xmath107 from @xmath108 .",
    "for the outer region we find @xmath91 . for spherical structures we identify both inner and outer profiles , which include @xmath109 .",
    "our resulting profiles only apply to gaseous baryonic structures , but we point out a simple method whereby observations of the baryonic structure in principle allows one to deduce the dark matter density profile .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank tomas bohr , james binney , sasha dolgov , lucio mayer , ben moore and the people in zurich for useful discussions , victor debattista and marcella carollo for observational guidance , and in particular ruth durrer for a valuable discussion .",
