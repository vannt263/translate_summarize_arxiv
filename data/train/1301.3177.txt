    "while many diverse studies have attempted to piece together a coherent picture of galaxy evolution over the redshift range that covers the last half of the age of the universe , the majority of the data sets are limited to a few clusters , do not reach high enough signal - to - noise ( s / n ) for the spectroscopy to allow individual galaxies to be studied , and/or cover only the more massive galaxies in the clusters .",

    "the formation redshift for the galaxies in ms0451.60305 would have to be even higher , see figure [ fig - zp_redshift]f , for the galaxies to be able to passively evolve into their low redshift counterparts .",
    "if the offset and slope differences of the m / l - mass relation are purely due to age differences , and therefore differences in formation redshift as a function of mass , we also expect to see offsets and ( to lesser extent ) slope differences in the relations between the metal line indices and the velocity dispersion . as the metal lines are predicted to be weaker with younger ages , we expect the intermediate redshift samples to show offsets to weaker metal lines .",
    "figure [ fig - zp_redshift ] show the zero points together with the model predictions from passive evolution models .",
    "the measured offsets do not allow a straightforward interpretation within the passive evolution model or a conversion of the offsets to a formation redshift .",
    "in general the offsets are smaller than predicted from the passive evolution model from thomas et al .",
    "in particular , all the intermediate redshift clusters have significantly stronger cn3883 than expected from the passive evolution model .",
    "cn3883 for the @xmath30 clusters represent 4 sigma deviations from the model with @xmath266 .",
    "if we were to adopt the age dependence of cn3883 from the model spectra by maraston & strmbck ( 2011 ) , the difference would be even larger due to the stronger age dependence predicted for cn3883 , see section [ sec - models ] .",
    "part of the difference between the formation redshifts as found from the fp and from the high order balmer lines @xmath248 may be due to different sensitivity in the two methods to progenitor bias .",
    "we found that the mean ages for the low redshift samples are lower than expected from the passive evolution model ( fig .",
    "[ fig - lage_mh_alpha ] ) and that some of the galaxies have ages too low for them to be the progenitors of the intermediate redshift sample galaxies .",
    "for example , roughly 40 per cent of the low redshift sample have ages of less than @xmath267 gyr , which is the look back time corresponding to @xmath211 .",
    "we have performed a simple test for the effect of the progenitor bias , by excluding these galaxies from the estimates of the mean ages based on the blue indices .",
    "this results result in a mean age for the low redshift sample of @xmath268 gyr , and bring the data in agreement with the passive evolution model ( fig .  [ fig - lage_mh_alpha ] ) . however , excluding these galaxies from the determination of the zero points for the scaling relations for m / l and @xmath248 versus velocity dispersion lead to insignificant changes , only .",
    "it also does not bring the zero point differences between the low redshift sample and the intermediate redshift samples for these scaling relations into agreement with each other .",
    "8.5 cm    as a different way of illustrating the disagreement between the fp and the strength of @xmath248 we use the ssp models ( maraston 2005 ) to predict the stellar m / l ratios , given the ages and metallicities derived from the line indices . as the possible dependency of the m / l ratios on the abundance ratios @xmath14 $ ] has not been modeled , we will assume that it is insignificant . on figure [ fig - mlstar ]",
    "we show the resulting m / l ratio versus velocity dispersion . in this view",
    "there is no change in the slope with redshift .",
    "we fit the samples with a set of parallel lines as shown on the figure .",
    "the zero point differences agree with the high the formation redshift found from @xmath248 versus velocity dispersion .",
    "formally we find @xmath269 .",
    "taken at face value , figure [ fig - mlstar ] compared with the fp ( figure [ fig - mlonly ] ) indicate that the stellar m / l ratios change significantly less than the dynamical m / l ratios since @xmath270 .",
    "we note that toft et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found a similar difference in the change of m / l ratios for massive galaxies between @xmath271 and the present .",
    "these authors speculated that the effect may be due to a change in the dark matter content . in our view , it is premature to conclude that a change in dark matter content can lead to the effect we find for the low mass galaxies in these intermediate redshift clusters .",
    "however , we plan to return to this issue using our full galaxy sample in the gcp . even if the difference in the formation redshift derived from the fp and from @xmath248 versus velocity dispersion may be consolidated by invoking a change in dark matter content , passive evolution implies that the metallicity [ m / h ] and the abundance ratio @xmath14 $ ] do not vary from cluster to cluster",
    ". however , both the distributions of the estimates of [ m / h ] and @xmath14 $ ] for the individual galaxies ( figure [ fig - lage_mh_alpha_dist ] ) and the mean values derived from the mean indices ( figure [ fig - lage_mh_alpha ] ) show that the mean [ m / h ] for ms0451.60305 is 0.2 dex below the other clusters , while the mean @xmath14 $ ] for rxj0152.71357 is 0.3 dex above the other clusters .",
    "both of these results contradict the model of passive evolution .    in summary ,",
    "it is not possible within the current ssp models using one imf slope ( salpeter ) for all the galaxies to find a passive evolution model that agrees with the data within the measurement uncertainties . while the slope changes with redshift of the m / l  mass and m / l  velocity dispersion relations indicate a difference in formation redshift for low and high mass galaxies , this is not consistent with the @xmath248 data for the intermediate redshift clusters .",
    "it is also inconsistent with the strong metal lines in general found for all the intermediate redshift clusters .",
    "further , the formation redshift implied by the m / l ratios is significantly lower than found from the higher order balmer lines .",
    "this result does not change even if we remove all galaxies in the low redshift sample with ages too young to have progenitors included in the intermediate redshift samples .",
    "future investigations may show if these two results can be consolidated by the presence of a change in the dark matter content , primarily for the low mass galaxies , between @xmath270 and the present .",
    "we have investigated what effect differences in the imf as a function of galaxy mass would have on the observed evolution . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the galaxies evolve passively , but that the imf slope depends on the galaxy mass or the velocity dispersion .",
    "this idea is based on recent results indicating that at low redshift higher mass galaxies may have steeper imfs than the low mass galaxies ( van dokkum & conroy 2010 , 2011 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012ab ; cappellari et al .",
    "however , an apparently contradicting result was found by van dokkum ( 2008 ) for the evolution of the imf , showing that a bottom - light imf for high mass galaxies can explain the redshift evolution of both the fp zero point and the ( u - v ) colors .    to investigate the effect of differences in the imf between low and high mass galaxies we used the models from vazdekis et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . using a kroupa ( 2001 ) `` universal '' imf instead of",
    "a salpeter imf leads to the same age dependence on the m / l ratio , while there naturally is a zero point difference in the resulting m / l ratios for the two imfs due to the presence of more low mass stars in models using a salpeter imf than those using a kroupa imf .",
    "however , the evolution in the m / l ratio over the length of time probed by our data is not significantly different for the two choices of imf .",
    "we then tested the difference between using a salpeter imf with @xmath272 as is used in the default models and a steeper and therefore dwarf rich imf with a slope of @xmath273 .",
    "the result is shown on figure [ fig - zp_redshift ] as the expected evolution of the m / l ratio . with the dwarf rich imf ( @xmath273 ) the m /",
    "l ratio evolves much slower for a given formation redshift .",
    "if we hypothesize that the imf slope is @xmath272 for the low mass galaxies and increases slowly to @xmath273 for the high mass galaxies , then it would reproduce the change in slope for the m / l  mass relation ( and the fp ) with redshift and lead to a formation redshift of @xmath274 for all the galaxies .",
    "the high order balmer lines are not significantly affected by the slope of the imf ( vazdekis et al .",
    "2010 ) . while we in principle can find a solution with a mass dependent slope of the imf that will mostly remove the age differences between low and high mass galaxies ,",
    "the result is that their luminosity weighted mean ages are all fairly young , about 2 gyr for the @xmath30 galaxies and about 4 gyr for the @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the model predictions for strengths of the higher order balmer line for such young ages are in disagreement with our data , and would also predict a much larger change in the strength of these lines with redshift than seen from the data , see figure [ fig - zp_redshift]f . thus",
    ", a simple model where the imf slope depends on the galaxy masses ( or velocity dispersions ) does not seem to be viable solution to a consistent model for the observed evolution of the zero points of the m / l  mass relation and the @xmath248velocity dispersion relation , under the assumption of otherwise passive evolution .",
    "this does not rule out that there could be imf variations as a function of galaxy masses in addition to more complex models for the galaxy evolution .",
    "we now turn to the possible differences in metallicities and abundance ratios .",
    "the results in sections [ sec - indices ] and [ sec - evolution ] indicate that the cluster ms0451.60305 has [ m / h ] approximately 0.2 dex lower than the other clusters , while rxj0152.71357 has @xmath14 $ ] approximately 0.3 dex higher than the other clusters .",
    "the results indicate that passive evolution is too simple a model to explain the data",
    ".    it may be possible to envision that the galaxies in these clusters can evolve into their low redshift counterparts in the time available .",
    "for ms0451.60305 this could happen through additional star formation to increase [ m / h ] , as long as such new star formation does not lead to ages younger than expected at redshift zero . for rxj0152.71357 a significant change in @xmath14 $ ] may only be possible through merging of the early - type galaxies with lower @xmath14 $ ] galaxies that are not part of the present sample .",
    "thus , these galaxies have to be either spiral galaxies , galaxies with significant emission , or galaxies fainter than the sample limit . in the first two cases ,",
    "the galaxies are expected to contain younger stellar populations than the early - type galaxies in our samples , and the merger products will therefore have younger ages than if the early - type galaxies evolved passively .",
    "any merger scenario also has to maintain the relation between sizes and masses , as we detect no evolution in this relation , cf .",
    "[ sec - sizemass ] .    additional star formation and/or mergers in some clusters and not in others then lead to different paths of evolution for the early - type galaxies in intermediate redshift clusters in order to reach the properties of the low redshift counterparts and one has to ask what the underlying reason for this may be .    of the clusters in the present sample rxj0152.71357",
    "has the clearest evidence for substructure , see sections [ sec - clusters ] and [ sec - clusterz ] .",
    "the difference in evolutionary path may be related to the interactions of the galaxies with the intracluster gas as the two substructures interact .",

    "in particular , they find that their stacked spectrum of galaxies from low density environment has weaker fe4383 than the rest of the galaxies .",
    "the cluster ms0451.60305 is significantly more massive than the other clusters .",

    "we confirm the change in the slope of the fp and m / l - mass relation as a function of redshift with the slope being steeper at higher redshift than at @xmath281 .",

    "significant changes in the imf slope with mass can not easily be reconciled with the changes with redshift in the m / l - velocity dispersion ( or mass ) relation and the relations between the balmer lines and the velocity dispersion .",
    "a steeper imf for higher mass galaxies leads to lower formation redshift for the high mass galaxies , which does not agree with the relatively weak balmer lines observed .",

    "therefore , in order for the intermediate redshift samples to evolve into galaxies similar to those in the low redshift sample in the time available , they would have to experience low level star formation ( ms0451.60305 ) or merging ( rxj0152.71357 ) to change [ m / h ] and @xmath14 $ ] of a large fraction of the galaxies .",
    "based on these results it is not clear if the galaxies in the studied intermediate redshift clusters share a common evolutionary path that will allow them to evolve from what is observed at intermediate redshift to the properties of their low redshift counterparts in the time available .",

    "this method of determining the offset between the magnitudes is more robust than a direct comparison as it eliminates the effect of the correlated errors .",

    "the cde in the dispersion direction will lead to a slightly degraded spectral resolution at long wavelengths . however , the measurements of the spectral resolution as a function of wavelength show that the variation is insignificant for the spectral parameters measured in this work .",

    "first the quartz - halogen flat field is bias subtracted and normalized slit - by - slit ( the normal procedure is to normalize row by row ) .",

    "just red - wards of this wavelength the typical signal from galaxy @xmath321 mag galaxy in our sample is only @xmath241 2% of the signal in the strong sky lines .",

    "[ eq - redfix ] can be used to correct all gmos - n spectroscopic data taken with the e2v detector array for the cde .",

    "( 2005 ) , in which case no correction for the cde is needed .    for nod - and - shuffle data ,",
    "the flat fields are derived by first bias correcting and normalizing the flat fields row - by - row . because the flat fields are taken without nod - and - shuffle they are then `` doubled '' by shifting the flat field by the shuffle distance , and combining the un - shifted and shifted flat field such that the resulting flat field contains the resulting flat field correction at both shuffle positions .",
    "the cde correction is only applied to the `` outer '' sections of a pair of spectra , since as shown on figure [ fig - redfix]a the effect cancels out on the `` inner '' sections .",
    "17.5 cm      after the dark subtraction and flat fielding ( processing with the task gsreduce ) the frames are sky subtracted using the task gnsskysub .",

    "in particular , the average difference between the rxj1226.9 + 3332 data and the ms0451.60305 data is about 3 percent , which is equivalent to 20 micron difference in slit width at the focal plane of gmos - n . this difference may be caused by a small difference in the focus setting for the laser cutter .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of stellar populations and evolutionary history of galaxies in three similarly rich galaxy clusters ms0451.6 - 0305 ( @xmath0 ) , rxj0152.71357 ( @xmath1 ) , and rxj1226.9 + 3332 ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on high signal - to - noise ground - based optical spectroscopy and hubble space telescope imaging for a total of 17 - 34 members in each cluster . using the dynamical masses together with the effective radii and the velocity dispersions </S>",
    "<S> we find no indication of evolution of sizes or velocity dispersions with redshift at a given galaxy mass . </S>",
    "<S> we establish the fundamental plane ( fp ) and scaling relations between absorption line indices and velocity dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the fp is steeper at @xmath3 compared to the low redshift fp , indicating that under the assumption of passive evolution the formation redshift , @xmath4 , depends on the galaxy velocity dispersion ( or alternatively mass ) . at a velocity dispersion of @xmath5 ( mass = @xmath6 ) </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath7 , while at @xmath8 ( mass = @xmath9 ) the formation redshift is @xmath10 , for a salpeter initial mass function . </S>",
    "<S> the three clusters follow similar scaling relations between absorption line indices and velocity dispersions as those found for low redshift galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the zero point offsets for the balmer lines depend on cluster redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> however , the offsets indicate a slower evolution , and therefore higher formation redshift , than the zero point differences found from the fp , if interpreting the data using a passive evolution model . specifically , the strength of the higher order balmer lines h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 implies @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling relations for the metal indices in general show small and in some cases insignificant zero point offsets , favoring high formation redshifts for a passive evolution model . based on the absorption line indices and recent stellar population models from thomas et al.we </S>",
    "<S> find that ms0451.6 - 0305 has a mean metallicity [ m / h ] approximately 0.2 dex below that of the other clusters and our low redshift sample . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm our previous result that rxj0152.7 - 1357 has a mean abundance ratio @xmath14 $ ] approximately 0.3 dex higher than that of the other clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the differences in [ m / h ] and @xmath14 $ ] between the high - redshift clusters and the low redshift sample are inconsistent with a passive evolution scenario for early - type cluster galaxies over the redshift interval studied . </S>",
    "<S> low - level star formation may be able to bring the metallicity of ms0451.6 - 0305 in agreement with the low redshift sample , while we speculate whether galaxy mergers can lead to sufficiently large changes in the abundance ratios for the rxj0152.7 - 1357 galaxies to allow them to reach the low redshift sample values in the time available . </S>"
