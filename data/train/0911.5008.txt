    "from lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) calculations , there exists a phase transition from ordinary hadronic matter to a new state of matter , the so - called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , at finite temperature .",
    "the @xmath4 suppression has long been considered as a probe of the new state produced in high energy heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the primordially produced charmonia via hard nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions are subject to subsequent nuclear absorption in the initial stage and anomalous suppression in the hot and dense medium .",
    "the normal and anomalous suppression are indeed observed in heavy ion collisions at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps )  @xcite and investigated in many theoretical models  @xcite .",
    "different from the @xmath0 production at sps , there are a remarkable number of charm quarks in the qgp phase produced in higher energy nuclear collisions at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and the regeneration , namely the recombination of those uncorrelated charm quarks offers another source for @xmath0 production  @xcite .",
    "obviously , the regeneration will enhance the @xmath0 yield and alter its momentum spectrum .",
    "from recently observed @xmath0 production at rhic  @xcite , the nuclear modification factor @xmath1 as a function of the number of participant nucleons @xmath5 at rhic is almost the same as at sps , see fig.[fig1 ] . the same suppression at sps and rhic looks difficult to be understood in models with only initial production mechanism , because the temperature at rhic is higher and then the anomalous suppression is predicted to be stronger at rhic , in comparison with sps .",
    "the puzzle of the same suppression was theoretically studied by many models . with the idea of sequential suppression  @xcite ,",
    "if the temperatures at rhic and sps are both in between the @xmath0 dissociation temperature and @xmath6 and @xmath7 dissociation temperature , the value @xmath8 will not change from sps to rhic energy . considering three gluon fusion as the main @xmath0 production mechanism  @xcite , the cold nuclear matter effect which is",
    "medium independent can explain the same suppression too . in the frame of regeneration",
    ", the competition between the initial production and regeneration can explain well the same suppression  @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution contains more dynamic information on the charmonium production and suppression mechanism .",
    "the regenerated @xmath0s are mainly distributed in low @xmath9 and central rapidity region  @xcite , but the high @xmath9 region is closely related to the cronin effect  @xcite and leakage effect  @xcite for the initially produced @xmath0s . while the @xmath0 yield which is a global quantity is not sensitive to the detailed dynamics , the transverse momentum distribution at rhic is very different from sps , see fig.[fig2 ] , and may be used to differentiate from the production and suppression mechanisms at different energies . in this paper , we investigate the @xmath0 transverse momentum moments and the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath10 from sps to lhc energy .",
    "we start with a transport equation  @xcite for the distribution function @xmath11 in central rapidity region and transverse phase space @xmath12 at time @xmath13 and fixed impact parameter @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for @xmath0 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath17 is the transverse velocity , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the loss and gain terms representing the anomalous suppression and regeneration in the hot medium . considering the gluon dissociation process @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the momentum integration of the dissociation cross section  @xcite multiplied by thermal gluon distribution , and @xmath22 can be obtained from detailed balance between the suppression and regeneration .",
    "the distribution @xmath23 at initial time @xmath24 is determined by the geometrical superposition of nn collisions , including the cronin effect  @xcite and nuclear absorption  @xcite .",
    "the local temperature , baryon chemical potential and collective flow appeared in the thermal gluon and charm quark distribution functions are determined by the ideal hydrodynamic equations  @xcite .    in comparison with the qgp phase ,",
    "the particle density in the hadronic phase which appears in the later period of the system evolution is much lower . to simplify the numerical calculation",
    ", we neglect the hadron contribution to the @xmath0 production . solving the coupled transport equation for the charmonium motion and the hydrodynamic equations for the qgp evolution",
    ", one can obtain the @xmath0 distribution function at the hadronization time and then get the final state @xmath0 yield and transverse momentum distribution .",
    "we now calculate the nuclear modification factor @xmath10 and averaged transverse momentum square @xmath2 as functions of the number of participant nucleons @xmath5 for @xmath0s produced in pb+pb collisions at sps and lhc energy and au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "all the calculations are in mid rapidity .",
    "the corresponding parameters for the initial charmonium and charm quark distributions in nn collisions and for the hot medium can be found in ref.@xcite . at rhic ,",
    "both the suppression and regeneration in the medium are stronger than at sps , the competition between the suppression and regeneration leads to almost the same @xmath10 at rhic and sps , especially for semi - central and central collisions with @xmath25 , see fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "however , the case is very different at lhc .",
    "the initially produced @xmath0s are almost all eaten up by the very hot , long lived and large fireball , and the regeneration becomes dominant in a wide region of @xmath5 . only for peripheral collisions with @xmath26 ,",
    "the initial production is important . due to the increasing suppression and regeneration with centrality ,",
    "the @xmath10 decreases with @xmath5 in the initial production dominant region and increases with @xmath5 in the regeneration dominant region , see fig.[fig1 ] .     as a function of @xmath5 for pb+pb collisions at sps and lhc and au+au collisions at rhic at mid rapidity .",
    "the sps and rhic data are from @xcite and @xcite , and the lines are our theoretical calculations .",
    ", height=264 ]    now we come to the @xmath9 distribution .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the averaged transverse momentum square normalized by the corresponding value in nn collisions , @xmath27 , as a function of centrality ( left panel ) and the @xmath10 as a function of @xmath9 ( right panel ) .",
    "while the @xmath1 is almost the same at sps and rhic , the transverse momentum distribution is really sensitive to the production mechanism . the dominant initial production , cronin effect and leakage effect at sps lead to an increasing @xmath28 with @xmath5 and an increasing @xmath3 with @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to sps , the regeneration is the dominant production mechanism at lhc which results in decreasing @xmath27 and @xmath3 . since we assumed charm quark thermalization in the medium , @xmath27 becomes saturated when the contribution from the initial production disappears .",
    "considering the fact that the regenerated @xmath0s carry low momentum , the @xmath3 is larger than 1 at low @xmath9 but vanishes at high @xmath9 .",
    "the case at rhic is in between sps and lhc where both the initial production and regeneration are important and the competition between them controls the @xmath0 production .",
    "it is the contribution from the regeneration that separates clearly the @xmath0 transverse momentum distribution at rhic from that at sps .    in summary",
    ", we studied the contribution from the primordial production in the initial stage and the regeneration in the medium to the @xmath0 production .",
    "we found that with increasing fraction of the regeneration from sps to lhc , the transverse momentum distribution behaves very differently and can be used to differentiate from the @xmath0 production mechanism in high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "as a function of @xmath5 ( left panel ) and @xmath10 at @xmath29 as a function of @xmath9 ( right panel ) for pb+pb collisions at sps and lhc and au+au collisions at rhic at mid rapidity .",
