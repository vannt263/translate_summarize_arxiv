    "there has been tremendous interest in the electron transport properties of semiconductor superlattices ( sls ) since the pioneering work of esaki and tsu@xcite .",
    "bragg scattering of carriers from the brillouin zone boundaries of a crystal produces bloch oscillations , or , equivalently , localized ( wannier - stark ) states within each unit cell period if the system is sufficiently clean .",
    "this regime is characterized by negative differential conductance ( ndc ) at sufficiently high fields , and occurs if the bloch frequency @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the electric field and @xmath3 the unit cell period ) is larger than the effective scattering rate @xmath4 . the large unit cell of the superlattice can allow electrons in a sl to perform these bloch oscillations before being scattered@xcite .    if the electric potential drop across @xmath5 unit cells corresponds to an optical phonon energy , bryksin and firsov@xcite predicted another high - field effect : so - called electron - phonon resonances , where an lo phonon mediates a transition between localized wannier - stark states whose energy separation equals the phonon energy .",
    "these resonances manifest as peaks in the current - voltage relationship and produce a nonmonotonic current - voltage dependence .",
    "experimental @xmath0 characteristics of cubic zns films have been identified with such resonances@xcite . growing interest in the transport properties of semiconductor superlattices , e.g. gaas / alas and inas / gasb , has resulted in several recent theoretical studies of these electron - phonon resonances in sls@xcite . unfortunately , to our knowledge , electron - phonon resonances have not been observed experimentally in sl transport within the ndc regime .",
    "several choices are available to calculate sl transport in the high and low field regimes .",
    "wacker and jauho@xcite established the relationship in some cases between different transport calculation methods , including miniband conduction@xcite , wannier - stark hopping@xcite , sequential tunnelling @xcite , and the non - equilibrium green s function ( ngf ) formalism@xcite and their respective ranges of validity , and reached the conclusion that the ngf contains the other three as limiting cases .",
    "for example , the semiclassical boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) , which can be solved to any desired degree of numerical accuracy by monte carlo simulations@xcite , can not accurately describe transport under high - field ( @xmath6 ) conditions@xcite .",
    "use of the generalized kadanoff - baym(gkb ) ansatz@xcite is limited in validity to slowly varying fields and time dependence .",
    "rott , linder and dhler@xcite employed the wannier - stark hopping transport technique to study the temperature dependence of electron - phonon resonances . their method is only applicable to the high - field regime .",
    "emin and hart@xcite obtained a @xmath7function electron - phonon resonance in the limit of a very wide energy band @xmath8 .",
    "bryksin and kleinert focused on narrow band(@xmath9 ) transport in a one - dimensional ngf model with@xcite and without@xcite the gkb ansatz .",
    "the approximations made in ref .  [ ] included relying on the periodic nature of the green s functions in a large homogeneous field and discarding the fourier components of the dyson equations beyond lowest order .",
    "the impurities were modeled with @xmath10-function potentials ( and hence only depended on the product of the impurity density and the scattering potential@xcite ) , and the sl bandwidths considered were much smaller than optical phonon energies , in order to obtain analytic expressions for the field - dependent dos and the transport .",
    "in our treatment here we use the kadanoff - baym - keldysh ngf technique@xcite to calculate the non - linear quantum transport .",
    "we solve for the field - dependent green s functions equations numerically , non - perturbatively including the elastic impurity scattering by directly inverting the ngf dyson equations .",
    "these green s functions , and the resulting density of states ( dos ) , depend on the impurity size , strength , and density separately .",
    "we then calculate the effect of inelastic ( phonon ) scattering as a perturbation .",
    "specifically we leave the retarded green s function obtained for elastic scattering unchanged , but alter the less - than green s function .",
    "a related model , where impurity scattering was treated exactly within the resonant level model , and phonon scattering was treated perturbatively , has been introduced before@xcite . in ref .",
    "[ ] the analysis focused on comparison of the model results with those obtained from the gkb ansatz . in our treatment",
    "we consider more general impurity types , and use the solvability of the model to explore the influence of impurity nature on the electron - phonon resonances .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 curves illuminate the nature of the electron - phonon resonances in a regime where elastic scattering dominates .",
    "because we treat more of the problem numerically we are able to consider all significant fourier components of the dyson equation , general sl bandwidths and impurity potential size and strength . in this way we can explore the properties of these electron - phonon resonances for a wider range of parameters with confidence .",
    "our approach therefore possesses several advantages over earlier ones : ( i ) it employs a more realistic form for impurity potentials that leads to better approximations for the dos ; ( ii ) other common approximations are relaxed , including restrictions on the growth axis miniband width ; ( iii ) it is applicable to both high and low field transport ; and ( iv ) it does not use the generalized kadanoff - baym ansatz@xcite to solve the dyson equation .    the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .  [ theory - method ] , we show the detailed theoretical and numerical methods used to calculate the retarded and lesser green s functions , from which are extected the dos and carrier distribution functions . in sec .",

    "we have numerically calculated the drifty velocity for fields near the electron - phonon resonance value @xmath81 , which typically ranges from @xmath82 v / m to @xmath83 v / m . because we treat phonon scattering as a perturbation , the calculated drift velocity is directly proportional to the electron - phonon coupling coefficient @xmath84 .",

    "these values correspond to @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , in 3-dimensions .",
    "we see that large impurity densities will produce weaker electron - phonon resonance peaks .",
    "when the impurity density is @xmath92 , there is only one peak in the velocity - field curve for the broad bandwidth sl ( fig .",
    "[ dep - imp - conc](b ) ) .",
    "indeed , the position of the peak is not at a resonance , so it s not an electron - phonon resonance at all . instead , it s the maximum of the entire velocity - field curve , which is the starting point of ndc . in fig .",

    "but the dos for a higher impurity concentration ( @xmath43=1/(116 ) , thick line ) tends to be very similar to the zero - field result ( which is shown as the dashed line ) . properly approaching the zero - field dos and the appearance of the maximum of current in the velocity - field curves",
    "indicate our method is valid for low - field situations .",
    "this contrasts with the wannier - stark hopping method that is often used in high - field transport , which will diverge under low - field conditions@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ imp - stre - conc ] , we compare the effects of the impurity strength @xmath94 and impurity density @xmath43 on the electron - phonon resonances .",
    "we find that the impurity strength can diminish the drift velocity considerably , but does not affect the height of the electron - phonon resonances as much as the concentration of impurities does . in fig .",
    "[ imp - size ] , we change the impurity size but keep @xmath95 fixed to observe changes in the electron - phonon resonances .",
    "when the impurity size increases , the resonance becomes weaker .",
    "[ imp - stre - conc ] and [ imp - size ] are calculated results for relatively perfect materials .",
    "we also model more imperfect materials by employing an impurity density of @xmath96 ( corresponding to @xmath97 in three dimensions ) , and use a rather small value for the impurity strength @xmath94 .",
    "the impurity size produces different effects on the electron - phonon resonance peaks for different bandwidths . in fig .",
    "[ dirty - imp - size](a ) , for the narrow bandwidth sl , impurities of larger size ( with @xmath95 constant ) flatten the electron - phonon resonance peaks .",
    "this contrasts with fig .",
    "[ dirty - imp - size](b ) , for the broad bandwidth sl , where larger impurities _ enhance _ the electron - phonon resonances stronger .",
    "this phenomena can be explained by comparing with the one - dimensional square potential barrier scattering problem .",
    "the reflection coefficient of a scattering electron is not a monotonic function of the barrier size ( still keeping @xmath95 constant)@xcite .",
    "instead , there is a maximum value for the reflection probability .",
    "we take @xmath98 as the average energy of incoming electrons and calculate the impurity size that maximizes the reflection coefficient . for the narrow bandwidth sl , @xmath99 , whereas for the broad bandwidth sl , @xmath100 .",
    "hence impurity scattering generates different trends for narrow and broad bandwidth sls in the region @xmath101 .",
    "there is another feature distinguishing relatively clean and dirty superlattices . in the clean case",
    "the electron - phonon resonance in the narrow bandwidth sl is stronger than in broad bandwidth one .",
    "but in the dirty case , the electron - phonon resonance in the narrow bandwidth sl is weaker than in the broad bandwidth one , e.g. when the impurity size is @xmath102 .",
    "the reason for this is as follows : when @xmath95 is large , all the collisions between electrons and impurities are essentially total reflection . in this case ,",
    "impurity scattering in a broad bandwidth sl is stronger than in a narrow bandwidth one because the spatial extent of the wannier - stark wave function @xmath103 is proportional to the bandwidth @xmath15 .",
    "thus electrons in a broad bandwidth sl experience more collisions in a wannier - stark oscillation period .",
    "but when @xmath95 is small , the collisions have both substantial transmission and reflection .",
    "the incoming electrons in a broad bandwidth sl have more energy and a larger transmission coefficient than in a narrow bandwidth sl .",
    "this makes impurity scattering in broad bandwidth sls weaker than in narrow bandwidth ones , which is the opposite of the clean case .",
    "we have also reproduced the earlier work of bryksin and kleinert@xcite and find a relation between bryksin s parameter for impurity scattering and ours : @xmath104 . however , this relation has a limited range of applicability because the dos of a wannier - stark level generally does not have the half - elliptical shape employed by bryksin , @xmath105 fig .",

    "however , eq . ( [ wacker - retarded - gf ] )",
