    "as a liquid is cooled down , its molecules will seek energetically favorable arrangements at the microscopic scale . it is reasonable to presume that among these local structural arrangements that are found to be particularly stable in the liquids will be the ones repeated periodically in the crystals .",
    "it is difficult to see how a liquid could freeze if this was not so .",
    "let us imagine that the crystal is assembled so as to maximise the density of just a single local structure .",
    "it would follow that a minimal condition on any hamiltonian used to model both the liquid and crystal phases is that it must stabilize this particular favoured local structure . the simplest such model would be the one that _ only _ stabilized this one local structure .",
    "this is a simpler picture than is usually invoked for liquid structure .",
    "there is , for example , an extended tradition  @xcite of focussing on non - crystalline favoured local structures in order to explain the kinetic stability of the supercooled liquid with respect to freezing . while eminently reasonable , the idea that a competing structure is _ necessary _ to explain liquid metastability does imply that a single stable local structure could not provide this stability , irrespective of its geometry .",
    "providing a test of this implication is a task for which our minimal liquid model is ideally suited . in this paper",
    "we shall explore the consequences of the minimal model on the liquid and solid states .",
    "our primary interest is to understand how the geometry of the favoured local structure ( fls ) determines the nature of the freezing transition .",
    "we shall show that the fls exerts its influence in different ways in the crystal and liquid phases : determining the lattice energy of the former and the entropy cost per fls in the liquid .    to address the relationship between the liquid structure and freezing ,",
    "we shall use a 2d lattice model , the favoured local structure ( fls ) model , which allows us to directly select the geometry of a favoured local structure from among the possible geometries  @xcite .",
    "previously , we have identified the crystal ground states for each possible choice of fls  @xcite and demonstrated that the decrease in liquid entropy with decreasing energy is smaller for liquids based on a low symmetry fls as compared with those based on high symmetry local structures  @xcite . in this paper , we present an account of the freezing transitions described by the fls model . in doing",
    "so we shall demonstrate how the entropy - energy representation of the phase transitions allows us to clearly see the dual role of the local structure in both establishing the energy of the crystal state and the entropy cost of local ordering in the liquid state .",
    "the question of the relationship between the local stable structure of a liquid and the ordering transitions of that liquid has , until recently , been limited to considerations of specific ( high symmetry ) geometries . to model the consequences of a local _ icosahedral _ coordination",
    ", dzugutov  @xcite introduced a spherical particle whose short range attraction was augmented with a next - to - nearest neighbour repulsion , adjusted so as to destabilize close packed crystals structures and enhance icosahedral coordination geometries . the dzugutov liquid was found to crystallize into a metastable dodecagonal quasicrystal  @xcite with the equilibrium crystal phases being body - centered cubic ( bcc ) at low pressures and face - centered cubic at high pressures  @xcite .",
    "probably the most extensively studied example of a liquid with a selected geometry is silicon  @xcite and its structural analogues  @xcite .",
    "a widely used potential for silicon , developed by stillinger and weber  @xcite , imposes a bond angle energy for triplets of particles to select for the tetrahedral angle . by reducing the strength of this bond angle potential",
    ", the local tetrahedral constraint can be continuously relaxed and equilibrium solid phase changes from the diamond structure to bcc  @xcite . at the value of the bond strength corresponding to the crossover between the two crystal phases",
    ", there is a significant freezing point depression and an associated improvement in the glass forming ability .    both the dzugutov and stillinger - weber potentials originated in modelling of actual atomic interactions .",
    "the recent interest in colloidal self assembly has been driven by an increasing capacity to experimentally manipulate the particle interactions themselves  @xcite .",
    "this new perspective has raised some new questions , closer in spirit to the subject of this paper . what is the simplest set of interactions required to stabilize a given target local structure ?",
    "general aspects of this question have been addressed in the tile assembly model of winfree and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "a more specific example has been studied by hormoz and brenner  @xcite who have looked at enhancing the frequency of a high symmetry arrangement of 8 hard spheres by adjusting the nearest neighbour interactions . restricting themselves to isotropic interactions",
    ", tindemans and mulder  @xcite explored the possibility of designing a unique crystal groundstate by minimal extensions of the range and selectivity of the interparticle potential .",
    "the kinetics of assembly must also depend on the geometry of the target structure .",
    "et al _  @xcite have considered this problem in the context of self assembly of the platonic polyhedra . among the most extensively studied models of anisotropic colloid interactions",
    "are spheres decorated by sticky patches .",
    "a number of studies of this model have addressed the question of how does the symmetry of the local interactions influence the phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the present study , while also addressing the issues concerning the relationship between favoured local structures and the thermodynamics of the phases that result , differs from these previous studies in that it demonstrates how the problem of the relationship between interactions and structure can be set aside , to permit a more transparent and complete exploration of the consequences of a given favoured local structure ( however its stability is engineered ) on the structure and stability of the associated condensed phases - disordered as well as ordered .",
    "we consider a 2d triangular lattice of ising spins ( each site has a single degree of freedom named _ spin value _ , which can take two values called _ up _ or _ down _ ) .",
    "these elementary variables are taken as a minimal model for local conformational degrees of freedom of a generic liquid .",
    "readers should note that this model is identical to one in which two different species a and b are distributed on the lattice .",
    "the local environment of a given site is defined as the spin state of its 6 nearest neighbours . in the set of @xmath0 possible environments ,",
    "there are 8 local structures that can not be inter - converted by rotations or spin inversion .",
    "these structures are sketched in the insets on figure  [ fig : evst ] .",
    "the labeling convention we adopted to design each local structure goes as follow : the first digit is the number of down spin ( dark sites on the pictures ) , and the second one is the length of the longest sequence of up spins in the structure ( when there is only @xmath1 or @xmath2 down site , this second digit is unnecessary , and associated structures will be named simply @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath5 structure has no plane symmetry and is therefore chiral . here",
    "we will consider only the case when the enantiomers are not distinguished .",
    "the chiral case @xmath6 , where we favour only one enantiomer , involves a number of interesting subtleties that will be addressed in a separate paper  @xcite .    among these 8 distinct local structures , we select one that will be designated as the favoured local structure ( fls ) .",
    "each site whose local environment is the fls ( to a rotation ) is assigned an energy of @xmath7 ; all the others have an energy of @xmath1 .",
    "note that this energy is independent of the spin on the given site , depending only on the spin arrangement of the 6 neighbouring sites .",
    "we evaluate the equilibrium properties for each fsl model using monte - carlo sampling .",
    "we consider a system in the canonical ensemble , at temperature @xmath8 ( in this work we will take @xmath9 ) . for high temperatures we have used the standard metropolis algorithm and , at low temperatures , the equivalent rejection - free method due to bortz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in which sites are organized in terms of the energy change associated with the spin flip . we have chosen this mc algorithm because , by using random spin flips , it retains enough of a connection to the actual dynamics ( glauber spin dynamics , in this case ) so as to provide some indication of the existence and nature of metastability .",
    "the price we pay for this extra information is an uncertainty in the transition temperature equal to the hysteresis in the transition temperature when comparing the heating and cooling runs . as a result of the absence of any significant supercooling of the liquid",
    ", we find the the uncertainty in the transition temperature is sufficiently small to satisfactorily resolve the trends discussed in this paper .",

    "we have previously  @xcite identified the ground states ( all crystalline ) for each choice of fls . to assist the discussion of the various freezing transitions , we present the crystal phases for the different fls s in figure  [ fig : crystal ] along with the energy per site @xmath17 and the number @xmath11 of distinct realizations of a fls on the lattice .",
    "note that three fls s have two distinct crystals with the same energy .",
    "( color online ) the average energy per site as a function of temperature for each fls .",
    "the measurements were made in an hysteresis cycle of temperature  cooling , in blue ( dark gray ) then heating , in green ( light gray ) .",
    "these curves were obtained with a @xmath18 lattice and a `` cooling rate '' of @xmath19 steps of the rejection - free algorithm per site and per unit of temperature . ]",
    "the temperature dependence of the average energies on heating and cooling are plotted in figure  [ fig : evst ] for each fls .",
    "we note that the choice of fls can result in either first order transitions ( @xmath4 , @xmath15 and @xmath20 ) , continuous transitions ( @xmath3 , @xmath21 and @xmath16 ) , or , in the case of @xmath22 and @xmath14 , multiple transitions ( see figure  [ fig : mult_trans ] for a magnified view in this case ) . in the cases where two degenerate polymorphs exist",
    "we find that only one of the two is observed to form in the case of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the observed crystal is labeled @xmath23 in figure  [ fig : crystal ] . in the case of @xmath16 ,",
    "the polymorphs are spin - inversion symmetric and either can form spontaneously from the liquid .",
    "in addition to the variety of freezing transitions , the equilibrium liquid states exhibit a considerable variation in their heat capacities @xmath24 and the maximum concentration of fls that the liquid can accumulate before freezing . in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we demonstrated that the influence of the choice of fls on the liquid structure could be attributed to the difference in the entropy cost per fls .",
    "contributions to this entropy cost per fls were found to come from both the symmetry of the favoured local structure itself ( the higher the symmetry , the greater the entropy cost ) and from the entropy of aggregates of fls s .    not only does the decrease in symmetry of the fls allow the liquid to accumulate more local order before freezing , but it also tends to result in large unit cells in the crystal  @xcite .",
    "this coincidence of effects means that large unit cells in the crystal phase will often be associated with a liquid that can accumulate a significant amount of local structure ( i.e. pre - order ) before freezing and help explain why we see little difference in the rate of crystallization of the different systems , even though the unit cell varies across a factor of 20 . to appreciate the extent of this pre - ordering , consider the case of the @xmath22 fls which freezes into our most complicated crystal structure",
    "( see figure  [ fig : crystal ] ) .",
    "this freezing involves multiple transitions ( as we shall describe below ) but if we select @xmath25 , a temperature that lies just above the first of the ordering transitions , we find that the local ordering has already reached roughly @xmath26 of the final crystal order . in figure  [ fig:32 ]",
    "we show an example configuration in the @xmath22 liquid at @xmath25 in which the entangled fragments of the crystalline order are evident .",
    "two phases are in coexistence when their free energies are equal . under the fixed size and temperature conditions of our simulations ,",
    "the appropriate free energy is the canonical or helmholtz free energy @xmath27 and the freezing point @xmath28 is identified through the resulting relation between the average energy @xmath29 and the entropy @xmath30 ,    @xmath31    for freezing transitions , a useful representation of the coexistence condition is a common tangent construction on the entropy - energy plane .",
    "this construction follows directly from eq .",

    "the entropy per spin is @xmath43 ( the factor @xmath44 reflecting the @xmath44 possible states of any individual site ) and the energy is the average concentration of fls s in a random state of the system , i.e. @xmath45    where @xmath11 is the degeneracy of the fls and is provided in figure  [ fig : crystal ] .",

    "[ eq : s_int ] and the respective references states for the liquid and solid , we have calculated the liquid and solid entropies by numerical integration of the simulation data ( in order to represent correctly the high temperature liquid , we used a regular sampling in the variable @xmath36 in this limit ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : svse ] we plot the entropy @xmath30 against the energy @xmath29 for the different choices of fls .",
    "as described above , the coexistence temperature @xmath28 is equal to the inverse of the slope of the common tangent between the solid and liquid entropy curves for those fls s that exhibit a 1st order freezing transition .",
    "these common tangents are indicated in each case by a straight dashed line .",
    "we have constructed this common tangent with the help of fitted curves for the entropy ( power law at low temperature , polynomial for the liquid part ) , which serve only to get rid of the noise for the numerical construction of the tangent .",

    "the second assumption is to assume that the crystal entropy at coexistence is zero .",
    "this assumption is justified by the observation on figure  [ fig : svse ] that the entropy range for the crystal is indeed very small as compared to the liquid s . a more accurate treatment of the crystal entropy is provided by a single excitation model discussed in the appendix . with these two assumptions ,",
    "the common tangent construction is expressed by the relation    @xmath56    solving for @xmath51 , the value of the liquid energy at coexistence , we have    @xmath57    where @xmath58 . the theoretical estimate of the transition temperature @xmath59 , given by the inverse slope of the common tangent , is    @xmath60    as is evident from eqs .",
    "[ e ] and [ tf ] , the freezing transition is determined ( within this approximate treatment ) by just two parameters : the crystal lattice energy , @xmath61 , and the liquid entropy factor @xmath55 .",
    "( the high temperature properties @xmath46 and @xmath47 being independent of fls or approximately so , respectively . )",
    "the factor @xmath55 contains the entropy cost of structure in the liquid : a large value of @xmath55 , generally associated with a high symmetry fls , corresponds to a local structure that incurs a large entropy cost . in fig .",

    "the notable exception to this success is the fls @xmath4 where the theory considerably overestimates transition temperature .",
    "the @xmath4 liquid actually exhibits a substantial decrease in energy prior to freezing , which is not correctly taken into account by the factor @xmath55 , as previously noticed  @xcite , which explains this deviation .",

    "the presence of multiple transitions for the @xmath14 and @xmath22 fls s is clearly seen when we examine the @xmath29 curves with an expanded temperature scale about the transition region , as shown in figure  [ fig : mult_trans ] . in both cases , the freezing transition is made up of three distinct transitions .",

    "the positions of the individual transitions are indicated . ]    in the case of the @xmath14 fls , the multiple transition scenario appears to arise from the existence of the two degenerate polymorphs ( see figure  [ fig : crystal ] ) .",
    "if we identify the three transition temperature as @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as indicated on figure  [ fig : mult_trans ] , it appears that the transition on cooling through @xmath64 corresponds to the formation of a polycrystalline mixture of the two polymorphs .",
    "further cooling sees the formation at @xmath65 of the single phase of the preferred crystal phase .",
    "the nature of the continuous transition at @xmath63 remains a puzzle .",
    "turning to the transitions in the @xmath22 system , the picture is quite different . instead of different crystal forms ,",
    "the sequence of transitions correspond to a step - by - step symmetry breaking .",
    "transition 1 marks the appearance of an orientation , at which the symmetry of the liquid is reduced from `` isotropic '' to a liquid with 3-fold rotational symmetry .",
    "on cooling , transition 2 is characterised by the loss of this rotational symmetry as a unique orientation is selected .",
    "finally , transition 3 breaks the reflection symmetry and the translational invariance in one direction , to give the low @xmath8 crystalline state .",
    "transitions 2 and 3 seem to be first order , though the small energy gap at transition 3 permits oscillation between phases in our finite size systems .",
    "this sequence of symmetry breakings is reminiscent of the liquid - nematic - smectic sequence of transitions observed in some molecular liquids .",
    "in the case of a single fls , the choice of the stable structure determines the freezing transition temperature by determining the energy of the crystal lattice and the entropy cost of the fls in the liquid .",
    "how might this picture change when we shift our focus to model liquids in which variations of the particle interactions are used to alter the local favoured structure ?",
    "previous work on modifications of the inter - particle potential for tetrahedral particles provides some insight into how subtle this problem can be . in the study by molinero _",
    "@xcite on the modified silicon potential , increasing the strength of the 3-body bending force constant results in an increase in the temperature at which the liquid freezes into the diamond structure . since the bending force constant has little effect on the solid , the influence of the potential acts through the liquid .",
    "an analysis of the enthalpy data  @xcite for the modified silicon liquid indicates that the major effect of the increase in the bending constant is to increase the liquid enthalpy , an effect absent from the fls model . in a model of spheres with a tetrahedral arrangement of sticky patches ,",
    "the angular width @xmath66 ( in radians ) of the individual patch represents another parameter for controlling the flexibility of the local structure .",
    "doye et al  @xcitehave found that this model fails to crystallize at all , arguing that , for patch sizes down to 0.2 radians , there are multiple near degenerate structures - dodecahedral clusters , cubic diamond and hexagonal diamond - with the result being some sort of structural traffic jam. in neither example cited here has the modification of the inter - particle potential corresponded to a change in the local geometry .",
    "in this paper we have examined the variety of freezing transitions exhibited by a model liquid characterised by a favoured local structure .",
    "we found examples of ordering transitions that were first order , continuous and multi - stepped .",
    "all liquids were found to order with little or , in the case of the continuous transitions , no evidence of a tendency to supercool , in spite of the involvement of some complex crystal phases .",
    "the variation of the transition temperature with choice of favoured local structure was found to be reasonably captured by a simple expression involving the groundstate energy @xmath67 and the factor @xmath55 related to the entropy cost per fls in the liquid .",
    "a couple of observations follow directly from the results reported here .",
    "i ) as all choices of fls , with the exception of @xmath3 , are frustrated ( i.e. not all sites can lie simultaneously in the fls : @xmath68 ) , it is clear that frustration provides no inherent impediment to freezing and is generally insufficient to stabilize the supercooled liquid . the competition between _ two _ fls s : one that can produce a low energy crystal while the other fls ,",
    "although more stable , can only order in a higher energy structure , looks like the simplest means of generating a glass forming liquid .",
    "ii ) the intuitive notion that large unit cell crystals are more difficult to crystallize finds little support here .",
    "we note that the very feature ( _ i.e _ low symmetry of the fls ) that results in large unit cells also ensures that the liquid , prior to freezing , can accumulate a substantial amount of the favoured local structure . as we have seen , these two effects tend to counter one another in setting the value of the transition temperature .",
    "the fls model provides a useful tool for building up our intuition on how local structure influences the properties of condensed matter .",
    "a report on the extension to 3d is currently in preparation  @xcite . by building the model around the idea of local stable structures , rather than having to discover them as a consequence of particle interactions , we believe that the fls approach offers a clearer language with which to ask questions about structure in condensed phases - both the influence of local structure and the nature of global ordering .        10 f. c. frank , _ proc .",

    "this model correctly identifies leading - order behaviour at low temperature . ]      in this section , we present an adapted version of the classical high - temperature expansions of spin models adapted to the fls model .",
    "it gives the exact values of the coefficients of the taylor expansion of the thermodynamic functions around @xmath77 .",
    "these coefficients are connected correlation functions at infinite temperature , which may be computed exactly .",
    "this reasoning is an extension of our work in  @xcite , where we presented the route to compute the first non - trivial coefficient .      to make the link with other spin models , we first introduce the hamiltonian ( energy of a configuration ) : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the lattice , @xmath80 the spin configuration , and the local energy variables are : @xmath81    each site of the lattice has @xmath82 neighbours ( @xmath82 is the coordinence of the lattice ) .",
    "we assume invariance under translations , which impose to use periodic boundary conditions if the system is of finite size .",
    "for the triangular lattice studied here @xmath83 . note that the fls model could be adapted to other regular lattices ; a review of this model on the 3d fcc lattice is in preparation .",
    "the partition function of the system is defined as : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the inverse temperature .",
    "all thermodynamic quantities derive from @xmath12 and its derivatives ; for example : @xmath86 are respectively the free energy , the average energy and the entropy of the system .",
    "working on the partition function @xmath91 , a few usual tricks allow us to rewrite : @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "note that @xmath94 at high temperature .",
    "these simplifications use the fact that @xmath95 takes only two values , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "now we can expand this product exactly : @xmath96 the meaning of this expansion is the following : @xmath55 is the subset of right - side factors selected in the expansion of the product , and @xmath97 is the cardinal of @xmath55 .",
    "if we now sum over configurations @xmath80 : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the total number of sites .",
    "we can rearrange this sum according to @xmath97 : @xmath100        for the explicit computation , free energy representation is more convenient since connected correlation functions vanish as soon as a site is `` far '' ( not overlapping ) from the others .",
    "thus every term in the expansion is extensive in the size of the system . in order to compute explicitly the connected correlation function at order @xmath104",
    ", we need to enumerate all possible ways to put an fls in each of the @xmath104 sites @xmath105 .",
    "it will be zero if they can be separated in two non - overlapping set of structures , thus we need only to enumerate a finite number of positions @xmath106 .",
    "the quantity @xmath107 can be interpreted simply as the probability that all sites @xmath105 lie simultaneously in the fls , in a random spin configuration .",
    "the first terms read : @xmath108 the truncature to the order @xmath109 would give the gaussian approximation to the density of states , as in  @xcite . now the interest of this new , more formal approach , is to be able to increase the precision and involve higher - order correlation functions .",
    "all that is left is to compute explicitly these connected correlation functions , which need only to test a finite ( but possibly big ) number of configurations .",
    "this is the only model - specific part of this derivation . using enumerating routines",
    ", we could quite easily get the @xmath110 term for fcc and triangular lattices .",
    "finally , to obtain an expansion of the free energy in powers of @xmath111 instead of @xmath112 , we can substitute the expansion of @xmath112 in terms of @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath113"
