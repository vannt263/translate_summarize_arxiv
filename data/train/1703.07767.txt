    "<S> [ fig2](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the drive is switched on the first pair is unaffected , as states @xmath21and @xmath20are not coupled to each other by the periodic drive . </S>",
    "<S> however , the degeneracy between states @xmath21and @xmath77is lifted as soon the driving amplitude becomes non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> the gap between the two resulting states to leading order in @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the first order bessel - function ( see appendix [ ap : analytic ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the drive is thus never perturbative at the level crossing : an avoided crossing forms in the quasi - energy levels , and the system can not remain in an eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , by setting @xmath6 away from the resonance condition , the static and driven states can be connected adiabatically provided that the drive is ramped up sufficiently slowly . </S>",
    "<S> these two regimes are indeed observed experimentally , and shown in fig . [ fig2](c ) .    in general , </S>",
    "<S> simply ramping up the modulation may not be the fastest protocol for reaching a desired final state with maximal fidelity . given the appearance of an avoided crossing , it is preferable to start driving the system off - resonantly . </S>",
    "<S> here , we either start above ( @xmath100 khz ) or below ( @xmath101 khz ) the resonance and ramp in @xmath84  ms into the corresponding driven state , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3a](b , c ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , in a second step , the interactions are linearly ramped to the desired value of @xmath6 in @xmath84 ms and the state can be transferred adiabatically along the avoided crossing ( see fig . [ fig3a](a ) ) , before @xmath69and @xmath95are measured ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3a](b , c ) ) . for a given final interaction strength @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> two distinct floquet states can be accessed depending on the choice of the initial on - site interaction @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when @xmath100 khz the atomic state is initially @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> as the interactions are decreased while staying in the driven system , the state is first transferred to a doubly - occupied state , and back to @xmath21when @xmath102 ( see the curves with filled data points in fig . [ fig3b](a ) and appendix [ ap : numerical ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , @xmath95decreases at first with @xmath6 , but is restored to its initial level as @xmath103 khz ( see fig . [ fig3b](b ) ) . in the other floquet state obtained with @xmath101 khz , the opposite behavior is observed : high double - occupancies for large @xmath104 are connected through a state with a high singlet fraction @xmath95 . in the appendix </S>",
    "<S> [ ap : numerical ] we show a comparison of the experimental results of @xmath69and @xmath95with the numerical calculations of these observables in the floquet states . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore observed that despite the final parameters being identical , the state of the system is determined by the path taken to reach these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our procedure of ramping the interaction strength can be generalized by ramping the frequency of the drive , which would therefore be an equivalent route in other physical systems .    to quantify the fidelity of this preparation protocol </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the return fractions @xmath70and @xmath105for each initial interaction strength , by reverting first the interaction ramp , and then the drive ramp . </S>",
    "<S> the change in the return fraction increases smoothly as the interactions are varied , and differ by @xmath106 at most from the initial corresponding quantity . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the observed increase of population of the unwanted states is gradual , rather than linked to a closing gap in the effective hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the peak associated to the resonance observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] has vanished using this protocol . </S>",
    "<S> an extension of this scheme could be used to prepare specific excited states of the static double wells by removing the periodic drive at a specific @xmath6 after crossing the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> for example , by starting at @xmath107 khz , then ramping the interactions to @xmath103 khz , and subsequently ramping down the periodic drive ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3b](a ) , right ) , a singlet @xmath21can be prepared at attractive interactions .    , while it cancels at @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> the double occupancy is maximal in the former , while the singlet is favored in the latter , which both occur twice per period . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the micromotion in our observables has a frequency of @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) this is confirmed experimentally by stopping the evolution of the atomic state at different phases @xmath110 within a full floquet period and subsequently measuring ps . , @xmath9and @xmath5to observe the micromotion at @xmath111 khz and @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the different floquet states accessed as in fig . [ fig3b ] can be distinguished by the phase of their micromotion measured with @xmath113 and final @xmath111 khz . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) measured micromotion amplitude at frequency @xmath109 and @xmath114 for the two floquet states vs interaction @xmath6 at modulation strength @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> error bars in ( b , c ) denote the standard deviation of 3 measurements , error bars in ( d ) are the standard deviation of the amplitude given by a bootstrap method . ]    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have averaged our observables over one driving cycle . </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to analyzing their fast dynamics on sub - cycle timescales which is not captured by the picture of an effective hamiltonian . in our measurement procedure </S>",
    "<S> , the tunneling is quenched below @xmath29 hz in @xmath53 @xmath54s , faster than the oscillation period @xmath115 @xmath54s , allowing us to probe the fast dynamics of the system . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we sample different points of the modulation cycle by varying the phase of the periodic drive @xmath116 , and always performing the measurement at the same absolute time @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> we have experimentally verified that the measurement does not depend on the launching phase of the modulation @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) , we show the evolution of the instantaneous @xmath5 , ps . and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 , when varying @xmath116 between @xmath118 and @xmath119 , for @xmath86 khz and shaking at frequency @xmath67 khz . </S>",
    "<S> all observables oscillate at twice the driving frequency , with the oscillations in @xmath5and ps . </S>",
    "<S> being opposite in phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected , as during the full drive cycle illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) , the energy imbalance between the wells is maximal twice ( @xmath120 ) , and cancels twice ( @xmath121 ) , corresponding respectively to the maxima in @xmath5and ps . . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath122 should be unaffected by the periodic drive , a much weaker oscillation is observed in @xmath9 , which can be caused by a residual magnetic field gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of micromotion shows that care must be taken when measuring the effective static hamiltonian , as the observed time - dependence can not be ignored for this lower frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> we now measure the micromotion for the two floquet states accessed previously using @xmath100 khz or @xmath101 khz ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3b ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these states are not only differentiated by the averages @xmath95and @xmath69 , but also by the relative phase of their micromotion , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the micromotion for both floquet states as a function of the interaction strength and observe a signal for all @xmath6(see fig . [ fig4](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the amplitude of the micromotion differs between the two states the overall signal does not depend much on @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the interaction strength is reduced , an oscillation appears at the driving frequency @xmath114 , and even becomes dominant for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this frequency component can be explained by a remaining finite site - offset @xmath22 or a residual amplitude modulation of the lattice depth ( see @xcite for more details ) .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated the full control of a periodically driven few - level system . by allowing changes in the underlying static hamiltonian as well as in the driving term </S>",
    "<S> , it was possible to transfer the initial static state to a targeted floquet state adiabatically even when the driving frequency was resonant to a transition between energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the local observables developed for static systems could be used directly , by freezing the evolution of the driven state before measuring it . finally , the micromotion on the time scale of the periodic drive was directly visible , confirming the need for a characterization beyond an effective static hamiltonian .    </S>",
    "<S> the versatility of cold atoms experiments offers the possibility to perform similar measurements in a fully connected lattice , and realize a many - body driven system in a future experiment . </S>",
    "<S> such a non - integrable system generically heats up to an infinite temperature , though long - lived quasi - steady states may exist @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of interactions to periodically driven systems also allows to create novel exotic phases of matter . </S>",
    "<S> for example , floquet engineering has been used to create topological states @xcite , which may lead to new phases of matter in the presence of strong interactions @xcite . additionally , the near - resonant modulation shown in this work has been theoretically demonstrated to significantly alter the properties of many - body phases @xcite , and could be applied to enhance anti - ferromagnetic interactions in the hubbard model , or even probe regimes of magnetic order not accessible within this model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> determining the relevant time - scales of the dynamical processes will contribute to the understanding of the scope and limitations of ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the observation of micromotion also paves the way to realizing novel states of matter , which are exclusive to periodically driven systems such as exotic topological states @xcite and time crystals @xcite .    </S>",
