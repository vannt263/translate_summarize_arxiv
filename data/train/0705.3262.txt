    "chemical reactions alter the composition of dense interstellar gas and theoretical models of this evolution offer the prospect of determining the relative ages of dense cores and molecular clouds ( e.g. , stahler 1984 ; leung , herbst & huebner 1984 ) . the accuracy of these derived ages will increase with that of the initial conditions of the model calculations , i.e. knowledge of the chemical state of the gas at some arbitrary time in the past . in regions of active star formation",
    "the prompt ( @xmath21yr ) removal of icy grain mantles of known composition , either by thermal evaporation or sputtering in shocks , almost simultaneously alters the chemical composition of protostellar cores and leads to a prolonged phase ( @xmath1 years ) of ` hot core ' chemical evolution . the destruction of abundant ` parent ' molecules and the formation of ` daughter ' species in principle allows the time since mantle removal to be measured from the presently observed gas phase composition ( charnley , tielens & millar 1992 ; charnley 1997 ; hatchell et al . 1998 ) .    despite the fact that they are probably formed from more diffuse material , of fairly simple chemical composition , estimating relative ` chemical ages ' for molecular clouds and for dense ( starless ) cores within those clouds is more problematic .",
    "models of quiescent dark clouds have largely been based on so - called ` pseudo - time - dependent ' models ( e.g. , leung et al .",
    "1984 ) . in this case",
    ", the physical conditions remain fixed at dense cloud values throughout the calculation whereas the initial conditions for the heavy elements are those expected from the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the chemical evolution in these purely gas phase models can be roughly divided between the abundances present at ` early - times ' , prior to a major fraction of the gas phase carbon being incorporated into co ( @xmath3 years ) , and ` late - times ' , approximately when the chemistry has reached a steady - state ( @xmath4 years ) .",
    "time - dependent models of dark clouds have shown that the carbon - chain molecules are best explained by ` early - time ' chemistry whereas several other molecular abundances , such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are closer to the predicted steady - state values .",
    "this has led to the idea that observed spatial compositional gradients ( e.g.  involving the carbon - chains and ammonia ) are due to a differing chemical ages in individual clouds ( e.g.  hirahara et al .",
    "1992 ; taylor , morata & williams 1998 ) .",
    "much effort has been made by theoretical astrochemists to reconcile the apparent chemical youth of molecular clouds with other evidence which suggests that these objects are long - lived entities ( e.g. , nejad , williams & charnley 1990 ) .",
    "for example , in the ` classical ' picture of molecular cloud evolution and low - mass star formation ( shu , adams & lizano 1987 ) , the ambipolar diffusion time - scale of a plasma with fractional ionization @xmath7 @xmath8 ( mckee et al .",
    "1993 ) governs the loss of magnetic support which is a prerequisite for gravitational collapse ( shu et al .",
    "1987 ) . in this picture ,",
    "molecular clouds are inferred to have lifetimes of @xmath9  myr ( mouschovias , tassis & kunz 2006 ) .",
    "however , recent studies suggest that molecular cloud formation , dissipation and star formation , are all rapid dynamical processes ( elmegreen 2000 ; hartmann , ballasteros - paredes & bergin 2001 ; mac low & klessen 2004 ) . in this revised picture , clouds form through the dissipation of supersonic turbulence and the important dynamical time - scale is the gravitational free - fall time at number density @xmath10 @xmath11 although the debate over the mode of star formation is not yet settled ( e.g. , mouschovias et al .",
    "2006 ; ballesteros - paredes & hartmann 2006 ) , if dense clouds and stars form within a few free - fall times , with the cloud life - time being @xmath12 13 myr ( hartmann et al .",
    "2001 ) , determining the chemical ages of molecular clouds may , after all , only require consideration of the abundances during the ` early time ' phase .    to test and refine the idea that chemical models could be used to measure the ( relative ) ages of molecular clouds requires two additional criteria .",
    "first , we would like to model the chemical evolution in a molecular cloud for which there is independent evidence that it formed recently .",
    "the southern coalsack is a well - studied region which fulfills this criterion .",
    "the coalsack is a group of molecular globules ( or clumps ) where the low average gas densities and the lack of discernible star formation activity ( nyman , bronfman & thaddeus 1989 ; kato et al .",
    "1999 ) , the presence of a diffuse inter - clump medium , as evidenced by ch@xmath13 observations ( centurin , cssola & vladilo 1995 ) , and the apparent dynamical youth of the major globule ( lada et al .",
    "2004 ) , all suggest that it is a region where simplistic chemical models may actually be applicable .",
    "second , we would like to use another time - scale to constrain the chemical evolution .",
    "the time - scale over which icy grain mantles are laid down in molecular clouds provides a natural constraint that is independent of the precise chemical state of the gas ( charnley , whittet & williams 1990 ) .",
    "this time - scale , , is determined by the rate at which oxygen atoms collide with and stick to dust grains , and depends on the gas density , the atomic oxygen abundance , and the total effective grain surface area ( see @xmath14[sec : tm ] ) .",
    "ice mantles have been detected towards several globules in the southern coalsack by smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and this allows us to estimate the mantle formation time - scale for each . in this paper , we use the mantle formation time - scale as the basic clock by which to measure the chemical chronology of dense globules in the , and thereby predict their relative chemical compositions .",
    "the southern coalsack is a conspicuous dark molecular cloud complex in the southern sky . unlike similar regions in the northern milky way , such as taurus , ophiuchius and perseus ,",
    "a striking feature of the  is the , apparently complete , absence of star formation ( nyman et al .",
    "1989 ; kato et al . 1999 ; bourke , hyland & robinson 1995 ; racca , gmez & kenyon 2002 ) .",
    "optical and millimetre - wave observations of molecules towards the background field star hd 110432 , which sample a line - of - sight through the inter - clump medium , show that the  is pervaded by translucent ( @xmath15 mag . ) , diffuse ( @xmath16 ) material ( codina et al .",
    "1984 ; van dishoeck & black 1989 ; gredel , van dishoeck & black 1994 ; centurin et al .  1995 ; rachford et al .  2001 ) .",
    "the low co abundance ( codina et al .  1984 ) , and the presence of only simple molecules , are consistent with the chemistry expected in translucent clouds .",
    "tapia ( 1973 ) identified three dark globules ( hereafter globules 1,2 & 3 ) which showed higher than average extinction .",
    "apart from isotopomers of co , the  has thus far only been mapped in oh , h@xmath0co , and h  i ( brooks , sinclair & manefield 1976 ; mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "nyman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) mapped the  in co lines and showed that tapia s globules were also peaks in co emission .",
    "observations of @xmath17co and c@xmath18o have identified several other distinct cores ( vilas - boas , myers & fuller 1994 ; kato et al .",
    "these studies indicate that dense condensations in the coalsack have densities in the range @xmath19 with gas and dust temperatures of around 10  k ( jones , hyland & bailey 1984 ) .",
    "an infrared extinction study of globule 2 ( lada et al .",
    "2004 ) indicates that it is in a state of dynamical equilibrium , and suggest that it formed only recently .",
    "thus , the southern coalsack is a region where dense cloud cores have recently condensed out of a more diffuse , low - extinction , interclump medium .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) performed 3spectroscopy towards eight field stars , located behind the southern coalsack , to search for ice absorption towards several of the dense globules .",
    "six of these sources lay behind or near globule 2 and one behind each of the other two .",
    "smith et al .",
    "detected water ice in each of tapia s globules with an additional four tentative detections in globule 2 .",
    "the largest ice column densities were found toward stars with the largest visual extinctions , as found in many other interstellar clouds ( e.g. , whittett et al .",
    "1988 ) . in general",
    ", the fact that the water features are only apparent above a certain level of @xmath20 is not direct proof that the ice must be present in the densest regions , although it is suggestive that this is the case . in the coalsack",
    ", however , the fact that smith et al.s field stars lay behind the globules , and we know from the co line maps that these are regions of higher density , leads us to conclude that the observed h@xmath0o ice is frozen out in the cold , dense globules , and not in the inter - clump medium . in what follows",
    ", we use data from smith et al .  for their sources designated ss1 - 2 , ss2 - 2 and ss3 - 1 to derive a mantle formation time - scale in each of tapia s globules 1 , 2 & 3 .",
    "we now show how observations of the ice column density can be used to estimate the ice mantle formation time - scales .",
    "accretion and hydrogenation of oxygen atoms will lead to a spherical ( silicate ) grain core of radius @xmath21 being covered by a water ice mantle , and the mean particle radius growing as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the instantaneous mean mantle thickness . a spherical grain of instantaneous radius @xmath24 increases in size by accretion of mass through oxygen atoms sticking to the surface at a rate ( wickramasinghe 1967 ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gas temperature , @xmath27 is the sticking efficiency , @xmath28 is the mass of an oxygen atom , @xmath29 is the bulk density of water ice , and @xmath30 is the number density of o atoms in the gas . for simplicity ,",
    "we have ignored the increase in mass due to the accretion of two hydrogen atoms per oxygen . because both the molecular accretion rate and the number of molecules required to build up one monolayer of coverage are proportional to the surface area of the grain , the radial growth of grains is independent of grain size .",
    "hence , at any particular time all grains will be covered by the same thickness of ice .",
    "an ice mantle will contain on average @xmath31 water molecules @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the hydrogen nucleon mass .",
    "a pathlength @xmath34 through a molecular cloud with uniform dust and gas number densities , @xmath35 and @xmath10 , has an ice column density of @xmath36 if the hydrogen column density , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , is related to the visual extinction through @xmath39 ( bohlin , savage & drake 1978 ) then the time to accumulate this much ice , the mantle formation time - scale , , satisfies @xmath40 here we have assumed that the dust obeys an mrn size distribution ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 ) such that @xmath41 in a range bounded by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and where @xmath44 for silicate dust ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "the ice mantle thickness at this time , @xmath45 , is just @xmath46 , and so we can evaulate the integral in ( [ eqn : intm ] ) to obtain a cubic equation in @xmath47 . as @xmath48/@xmath20 is determined observationally ,",
    "the cubic can be solved to obtain @xmath47 for any source .",
    "we must now calculate the time , , required to accrete this thickness of ice .",
    "accretion on to grains removes oxygen atoms from the gas at a rate @xmath49 where the total available grain surface area per nucleon at time @xmath2 , @xmath50 , is @xmath51 the factor of 4 in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : dndt ] ) is due to the fact that @xmath52 represents the total grain surface area ( @xmath53 ) , whereas the cross - section for accretion onto each grain is equal to @xmath54 .",
    "subject to some approximations , an analytical solution for  can be obtained .",
    "firstly , accretion on to grains is the dominant loss route for o atoms in dark clouds , so we neglect the effects of other chemical processes on @xmath30 .",
    "we also assume that the underlying power - law for @xmath35 is not modified by coagulation . for time - scales",
    "sufficiently short that @xmath55 is approximately unchanged ( i.e.  only thin mantles have formed ) , the total surface area of the bare grains integrated over the mrn size distribution , @xmath56 , is equal to @xmath57 @xmath58/h . for constant @xmath59 , the solution of eqn .",

    "experimental measurements of amorphous water ice deposited at low temperatures indicate densities in the range 0.61  g  @xmath68 , depending on the details of the ice deposition ( e.g.  jenniskens & blake 1994 ; stevenson et al .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath69  g  @xmath68",
    ". values of @xmath48 , @xmath20 , and @xmath10 for each of the three globules are taken from the observations of kato et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and smith et al .",
    "the only remaining parameter required to calculate  is the initial oxygen atom abundance in the gas , which depends on the elemental abundances in the coalsack , and on the original chemical conditions in each globule ( i.e.  how much oxygen was locked up in co and other molecules ) . for the chemical models described in the following section ,",
    "o atom abundances of @xmath70 and @xmath71 are assumed , depending on whether the chemistry in each globule was initially appropriate for translucent ( t ) or diffuse ( d ) material .",
    "table  1 lists the physical conditions observed in each globule , and the corresponding values of @xmath47 and  derived for each object . in all cases the derived mantle thicknesses are significantly less than the maximum possible value , @xmath72 , showing that only a small fraction of the total oxygen is frozen out as water , and that each globule must be much significantly younger than the accretion time - scale .",
    "the  values derived are consistent with these globules having formed recently ( cf .",
    "@xmath73 years ; lada et al .",
    "the principal uncertainties in our derived values of come from uncertainties in the values of @xmath59 and the initial gas - phase oxygen atom abundance .",
    "for example , if we truncate the grain size distribution at @xmath74    instead of 50   , this reduces the effective grain surface area by a factor of almost two - thirds , and thus increases the derived values of  by 50 per cent .",
    "similarly , because the initial values for @xmath75 differ by a factor of two between models d and t , the derived ages differ by a similar factor .",
    "hence , determining the absolute age of each core requires knowledge of the initial chemical conditions and the grain size distribution .",
    "however , it is likely that each globule coalesced from material with similar properties , and so the _ relative _ ages will be much more accurate .",

    "+ column densities are calculated by multiplying the abundance calculated by our chemical model at time  by the h@xmath0 column densities determined from the visual extinction measurements of smith et al .",
    "+ d and t refer to models with the initial conditions appropriate for diffuse or translucent material respectively ( see table  ) .",
    "comparing figures [ fig : g1 ] and [ fig : g2 ] it is apparent that although the chemical evolution of both globules is similar in many respects , the difference in density results in a slightly different chemistry in each source . if the globules formed rapidly from diffuse cloud material , it takes a long time for the conversion of the initially atomic material into predominantly molecular form , but in the denser globule 2 the co / c ratio becomes @xmath77 after @xmath78  yr , whereas in the lower density globule 1 the transition takes almost 1  myr .",
    "the transformation of atomic nitrogen into n@xmath0 takes even longer in each source .",
    "the large abundances of c@xmath79 and n@xmath79 act to suppress the abundances of species such as cn , no , and so , which in turn tend to reduce the abundances of many other species below their ` typical ' dark cloud values . in both globules",
    "hcn , nh@xmath80 , hc@xmath80n , and ch@xmath80cn remain at low abundances for @xmath81  myr , although their abundances become somewhat larger in globule 2 at later times .",
    "based on our values of , globule 1 is older than globule 2 , and so the difference in abundances between the two regions will not be as pronounced as if both were the same age , but we predict that in globule 2 the abundances of h@xmath0co , hcn , hc@xmath80n , and cs , should be @xmath823 times larger than in globule 1 .    the alternative scenario , in which co and n@xmath0 formed prior to the cores reaching the critical extinction for water ice formation to occur , results in larger abundances of several molecules , especially sulphur - bearing species .",
    "for example , so , so@xmath0 , and h@xmath0s are much more abundant in panels ( b ) of figures [ fig : g1 ] and [ fig : g2 ] . again , chemical differences between the two sources arise primarily due to their different ages , and we expect that carbon chain species such as c@xmath80h and c@xmath83h should be 23 times more abundant in the younger globule 2 , whereas nh@xmath80 , so and so@xmath0 should be more abundant in globule 1 .    in terms of discriminating between the two model scenarios ,",
    "there are large differences in the abundances of several species .",
    "if the globules formed directly from diffuse material , the abundances of carbon - chain molecules such as c@xmath83h will be larger than if the gas was initially molecular .",
    "on the other hand , the reduced c@xmath79 abundance in the latter case leads to larger abundances of many other molecules such as h@xmath0co , nh@xmath80 , hcn , hnc , and especially so and so@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , observations of these species in the coalsack can in principle be used to determine which model is correct . in order to allow comparison with observations ,",
    "table  [ tab : results ] lists the column densities for selected species in each of the three globules at the appropriate time , , calculated for each model .",
    "we have also investigated the effects of altering various parameters of our models . as discussed above",
    ", we used the elemental abundances of savage & sembach ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , if we consider the only direct measurement taken toward the coalsack , jensen , rachford & snow ( 2005 ) reported a low elemental o / h ratio of only @xmath84 toward hd 110432 , a factor of four less than used in our model ( although the error bars on this measurement are also consistent with a ` normal ' o / h ratio . )",
    "we therefore ran our model with the abundances of all elements depleted by a factor of four . in the case of initially translucent conditions ( model t )",
    "the effects are relatively minor , but for model d we find that the reduced elemental abundances act to speed up the transition from the diffuse - cloud - type chemistry to the dark - cloud - type chemistry , resulting in enhanced abundances of species such as h@xmath0co , nh@xmath80 , hcn , so , and so@xmath0 .",
    "however , a key aspect of this change is that it also increases the values of  by a factor of four , since the o atom freeze - out rate is reduced . for the observed ice thicknesses in globule 1",
    "this implies that that this source must have an age comparable to or greater than the accretion time - scale , which is equal to 1.2  myr .",
    "this conflicts with other evidence that the  is a relatively young region ( see @xmath14  2 ) , and so we consider it likely that the elemental abundances ( or at least the oxygen abundance ) in the coalsack are close to standard interstellar values .",
    "we also investigated the effects of a non - zero metal abundance , by running each model with an initial abundance of si@xmath13 equal to @xmath85 .",
    "we find that the effects on the chemistry of globule 1 are minor , but in the denser globule 2 the effects are more important .",
    "figure  [ fig : metals ] compares the abundances of those species most affected by the metal abundance in models d and t for globule 2 .",
    "we see that the effects are largest in model d at late times ; at the early times implied by the observed water ice column densities the presence or absence of metals has little influence on the predicted abundances .",
    "one exception is hc@xmath80n , where the early - time abundance is depressed in model t when si@xmath13 is included .",
    "most models of interstellar dark cloud chemistry assume initial conditions appropriate for diffuse clouds , i.e.  they assume that the cloud formation timescale is much less than the chemical timescale . for typical dark cloud densities of @xmath86  @xmath68 ,",
    "the exact choice of the initial conditions is not so important , as the chemistry rapidly evolves from the diffuse cloud conditions into ` standard ' dense cloud chemistry .",
    "our results show that , for lower density gas such as the globules in the coalsack , the transformation time may be much longer , of order myr . in this case , the time spent in the translucent phase is a key parameter of the model , and the dense globules retain a chemical ` memory ' of the prior conditions .",
    "hence , in principal , molecular observations of the dark globules can be used to constrain the dynamics of their origins .",
    "rachford et al .  (",
    "2001 ) observed co and h@xmath0 toward the field star hd 110432 , and derived a co / h@xmath0 column density ratio of @xmath87 , suggesting that the molecular fraction in the inter - clump medium is low .",
    "however , at such low h@xmath0 column densities the overall co / h@xmath0 ratio may be low due to co dissociation in the outer layers where @xmath88 , and is still consisitent with almost all c in co in the central regions ( e.g.  van dishoeck & black 1989 ) .",
    "it is difficult to use such observations to tightly constrain the c / co ratio in the interclump medium .",
    "although there have been several studies of dust and extinction in the coalsack , there is a dearth of molecular line observations of this region . as far as we know , the only molecules observed in the coalsack are co ( huggins et al .",
    "1977 ; codina et al .",
    "1984 ; kato et al .  1999 ) , oh , and h@xmath0co ( brooks et al .  1976 ) . the latter observed the 6  cm formaldehyde @xmath89@xmath90 line in absorption , and derived a h@xmath0co / h@xmath0 abundance of @xmath12 10@xmath91 , at least an order of magnitude smaller than the abundances we derive for the globules in table 3",
    ". however , the 6  cm line absorption feature appears to arise preferentially from the lower density regions surrounding the dense core rather than from the dense core itself ( snell 1981 ) .",
    "this would appear to be confirmed by the fact that brooks et al .",
    "report the emission from the h@xmath0co is extended over a size of 12 arcminutes ( similar to that of the oh emission ) , and also by the fact that our chemical model predicts a h@xmath0co abundance of @xmath92 in low - density , translucent material . a second effect to consider",
    "is that extinction maps reveal the densest regions of the globules are likely of order 13 arcminutes in size ( bok 1977 ; jones et al .",
    "1980 ; lada et al .  2004 ) , smaller than the 4 arcminute beamsize of brooks et al .",
    "hence , h@xmath0co features arising from the centers of the globules will suffer from beam dilution .",
    "we conclude that the 6  cm observations of brooks et al .  most likely trace the interclump medium .",

    "2002 ) . in reality , such prestellar globules have spatial density gradients , and the observed ice column density depends on the particular line - of - sight path integral through the cloud .",
    "recent studies of the infrared extinction of field stars which lay behind these globules have allowed detailed maps to be made of the visual extinction through several globules ( alves , lada & lada 2001 ; kandori et al .",

    "the dust density profile is usually well matched by a bonnor - ebert sphere ( alves et al .",
    "2001 ; racca et al .",

    "the ice formation time - scale derived for any sightline will always lag that of the dynamical time - scale over which the mass distribution was assembled .",
    "hence , if 3 micron observations towards fields stars behind such globules can be made to allow their _ radial ice profile _ to be constructed , this could eventually be employed as a good measure of the dynamical time .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper allows us to calculate the water ice column density as a function of both time and offset , @xmath97 , from the core center in coalsack globule 2 , where @xmath98 is from a bonnor - ebert sphere ( racca et al .",
    "2002 ) . as an example",

    "oxygen atom accretion and reaction to form h@xmath0o ice is a ` one - way ' process ( at least until a protostar has formed ) , is essentially unaffected by gas - phase chemistry , and begins only when the dense core forms .",
    "hence , ice column densities can be employed as an independent measure of physical age .",
    "a combination of ice absorption and molecular emission observations can thus lead to quantitative measures of globule age , and allow correlations between physical and chemical evolution to be explored .",
    "we have determined the ` ice mantle age ' , , of three dense globules in the southern coalsack , based on the time needed to deposit the h@xmath0o ice abundances observed by smith et al .",

    "these predictions can be easily tested by future molecular line observations of the coalsack .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows :    * in each globule only a small fraction of the total available gas - phase oxygen is frozen out as water , indicating that each must be significantly younger than the accretion time - scale .",

    "the chemical evolution is very sensitive to the initial conditions when the visual extinction becomes large enough for water ice to accrete . in particular , whether carbon and nitrogen are atomic or locked up in co and n@xmath0 has a profound influence on the chemistry : if @xmath101 at @xmath102 , the abundances of many species are less than if the material is initially in molecular form .",
