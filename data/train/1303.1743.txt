    "numerous applications of the rnyi entropy in information theoretic learning , statistics ( e.g. , classification , distribution identification problems , statistical inference ) , computer science ( e.g. , average case analysis for random databases , pattern recognition , image matching ) , and econometrics are discussed , e.g. , in principe ( 2010 ) , kapur ( 1989 ) , kapur and kesavan ( 1992 ) , pardo ( 2006 ) , escolano et al .
