    "the x - ray transient xte j1550564 was discovered on 1998 september 7 @xcite with the _ all sky monitor _ ( asm ) on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) .",
    "soon after optical @xcite and radio @xcite counterparts were identified .",
    "observations with the rxte _ proportional counter array _ ( pca ) were performed on an almost daily basis between 1998 september 7 and 1999 may 20 .",
    "the 1998/1999 outburst of xte j1550564 consisted of two parts , separated by a minimum that occurred around 1998 december 3 ( mjd 51150 ; see figure [ asm_fig ] ) .",
    "the first part of the outburst ( until mjd 51150 ) has been the subject of work by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* timing behavior during the rise ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spectral behavior ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* timing behavior ) . during the initial 10 day",
    "rise a quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) was found , together with a second harmonic @xcite .",
    "it had a frequency between 82 mhz and 4 hz , that smoothly increased with the x - ray flux . during the strong flare ( reaching 6.8 crab ) that occurred around mjd 51075 @xcite ,",
    "a qpo was found with a frequency of 185 hz @xcite .",
    "high frequency oscillations were also found on three other occasions , with frequencies between 161 and 238 hz .",
    "low frequency qpos ( 313 hz ) were also observed , during the strong flare and the decay of the first part of the outburst .",
    "correlations between spectral parameters and the low frequency qpos ( for the entire outburst ) have been presented by @xcite .",
    "traditionally the behavior of black hole x - ray transients has been described in terms of transitions between four canonical black hole states ( for overviews of black hole spectra and power spectra we refer to @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the classification of an observation into one of these four states is based on luminosity , spectral and timing properties , and on the order in which they occur .",
    "the spectra of black hole x - ray binaries are often described in terms of a disk black body component , believed to be coming from an accretion disk , and a power law tail at high energies , which is thought to arise in a comptonizing region ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the power spectra can be described by a ( broken ) power law , with sometimes one or more quasi - periodic oscillation peaks superimposed .",
    "the parameter usually thought to determine the state of the black hole is the mass accretion rate .",
    "the definitions of the different states are rather loose and have shown some variation between authors ; we therefore only give a general overview of the four canonical states in order of inferred increasing mass accretion rate :    * low state ( ls ) : the 220 kev x - ray spectrum can be described by a single power law , with a photon index ( @xmath1 ) of @xmath21.5 plus sometimes a weak disk black body component ( @xmath31 kev ; less than a few percent of the total luminosity ) .",
    "the power spectrum shows strong band - limited noise with a typical strength of 2050% rms and a break frequency ( @xmath4 ) below 1 hz .",
    "* intermediate state ( is ) : in the x - ray spectrum both the power law ( @xmath52.5 ) and disk black body components ( @xmath61 kev ) are present",
    ". the noise in the power spectrum is weaker ( typically 520% rms ) and the break frequency is higher ( @xmath7110 hz ) than in the ls .",
    "qpos between 1 and 10 hz are sometimes observed .",
    "* high state ( hs ) : the x - ray spectrum is dominated by the disk black body component ( @xmath81 kev ) , and the power law component ( @xmath9 ) is weak or absent .",
    "the noise in the power spectrum is power law like and very weak , with a strength of less than 23 % rms .",
    "* very high state ( vhs ) : like in the is the x - ray spectrum is a combination of a disk black body ( @xmath812 kev ) and a power law ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the power spectrum shows noise , that can either be hs - like ( power law ) or ls - like ( band limited ; 1 - 15% rms , @xmath7110 hz ) .",
    "qpos are often seen in the vhs with frequencies between 1 and 10 hz .",
    "note that there is little difference between the power spectral and x - ray spectral properties of the vhs and is , although conventionally the total flux in the vhs is described as much higher than that in the is @xcite .",
    "the reason that the is was introduced as a separate state @xcite basically is that it occurred in gs 112468 at epochs when the source appeared to be evolving gradually from hs to ls and had a flux that was only 10% of that during the peak of the vhs @xcite .",
    "it could not , therefore , in the one - dimensional classification outlined above , be identified with the vhs which by definition occurs at the upper end of the inferred mass accretion range , above the hs .",
    "all three states , ls , is , and vhs are characterized by the presence of strong band limited noise and a hard power law component , and are in that sense much more similar to each other than to the hs , which is characterized by these features being very weak or absent .    according to",
    "@xcite xte j1550564 went through the vhs , hs , and is during the first part of the outburst .",
    "in this paper we present a study of the correlated spectral and timing behavior of xte j1550564 during the second part of its outburst",
    ". we will discuss the results for xte j1550564 using some of the canonical terminology , in order to compare our results with those of other transients .",
    "however , we will also discuss the discrepancies of the canonical one - dimensional model with the results obtained for xte j1550564 ; these discrepancies concern in particular the way in which the various states relate to each other .",
    "we find the source moved through all the four black hole states , in a way that is highly suggestive of a new two dimensional interpretation of the black hole states .    in section [ obs_sec ]",
    "we explain our analysis methods .",
    "our results are presented in sections [ lc - cd_sec ] , [ power_sec ] , and [ radio_sec ] .",
    "these sections are intended for the specialized reader , the level of detail is rather high . a separate summary of the most important results is therefore given at the beginning of the discussion ( section [ discuss_sec ] ) .",
    "we end by summarizing our main conclusions in section [ conlude_sec ] .",
    "for our analysis we used all public target of opportunity rxte / pca @xcite data for xte j1550564 taken between 1998 november 22 23:38 utc ( mjd 51139)and 1999 may 20 19:37 utc ( mjd 51318 ) .",
    "this adds up to 171 single observations , corresponding to a total observing time of @xmath2400 ks .",
    "when we refer to a single observation , we mean a part of the data with its own unique rxte observation i d ; all observations will be referred to by their modified julian date ( mjd ) at the start of the observation . in all light curves and color - color diagrams each point represents one single observation .",
    ".data modes of the rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) .",
    "the first column gives the dates during which the different modes were active ( mjds in brackets ) .",
    "the standard 1 and 2 modes ( top two lines ) were always active.[modes_tab ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the first type b observation occurred on mjd 51245 .",
    "the source had moved further up branch ii ( hc@xmath20.016 ) , compared to the previous ( type a ) observations .",
    "figure [ obs-53_fig ] shows the power spectrum of this observation in four energy bands .",
    "a very sharp qpo was present around 6 hz , with harmonics around 12 and 18 hz , and a sub - harmonic around 3 hz .",
    "there were also indications for a peak around 24 hz , but our fits showed it was not significant . fitting",
    "the power spectrum with a power law and lorentzians ( six in total ) gave a poor result ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "we tried using a power law and gaussian functions ( again six ) instead , which improved the quality of the fit ( @xmath13 , @xmath12 , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the two extra peaks , at @xmath20.2 hz and at @xmath21.25 times the frequency of the 6 hz qpo , were added to the fit function to account for a low frequency component , and for the shoulder of the 6 hz qpo , respectively .",
    "the fit results ( 260 kev ) for the four qpos and the shoulder component are given in table [ obs_53_tab ] .",
    "the qpos are not perfectly related harmonically , most likely because the fit function did not describe the data well enough .",
    "the 0.011 hz noise was fitted with a single power law , with @xmath14 and an rms amplitude of 5.6@xmath15% .",
    "the photon energy spectra of the various power spectral components are shown in figure [ obs-53_energy_fig ] .",
    "except for the 3 hz qpo , and the noise component , all qpos showed a considerable increase in strength with photon energy .",
    "the 0.011 hz noise only showed a weak increase , and the 3 hz qpo behaved similar to the 6 hz qpo in the type a - i power spectra , in that it seemed to become weaker above 10 kev .",
    "selections were made on color , time and count rate .",
    "it was found that the harmonic at 18 hz was more significant at low hard colors .",
    "other type b power spectra were found between mjd 51247 and mjd 51253 , with qpos that were similar to those on mjd 51245 .",
    "their 6 hz qpos had frequencies between 5.3 hz and 6.1 hz , rms amplitudes between 3.3% and 3.4% , and q - values between 6.2 and 7.3 .",
    "the 3 hz qpos had rms amplitudes between 1% and 2.3% and showed a weak trend of an increase with hard color .",
    "the mjd 51245 observation remained the only one in which the harmonic around 18 hz was significantly detected .",
    "figure [ qpo - hc_fig ] shows the frequencies of the type b qpos ( squares ) as a function of the hard color .",
    "although , based on the q - value ( @xmath28 ) of the 6 hz qpo and the harmonic content , the power spectrum of the mjd 51250 observation was classified as type b by @xcite , they also found that the time lag behavior of this observation was quite different from that of the other type b observations .",
    "based on this time lag behavior the observation was classified as type c by @xcite , making it one of only two ( see below for the second ) type c observations during the second part of the outburst .",
    "more deviations from the type b power spectra were found ; in addition to the power law noise ( 1.6@xmath160.2 % ) a strong noise component was present at 0.11 hz ( see figure [ qpo - types_fig]d ; also @xcite ) .",
    "this noise component , which we fitted using a zero - centered lorentzian with a width of @xmath23 hz , was present in all the energy bands , with rms amplitudes of 13.1@xmath160.3% ( 260 kev ) , 3.3@xmath161.2% ( 26.5 kev ) , 18.6@xmath160.5% ( 6.513.1 kev ) , and 28.0@xmath160.8% ( 13.160 kev ) .",
    "four low frequency qpos were found in the 2 - 60 kev band at ( rms amplitudes in brackets ) 1.7@xmath160.6 hz ( 2.74@xmath17% ) , 3.35@xmath160.03 hz ( 5.8@xmath162.0% ) , 6.68@xmath160.15 hz ( 6.7@xmath160.2% ) , and 13.68@xmath160.15 hz ( 3.2@xmath15% ) .",
    "when comparing these numbers with those of the type b observations , it shows that the rms amplitudes of the 3 hz and 6 hz qpos are , respectively , a factor @xmath22.56 and @xmath22 higher than in the type b observations .",
    "the qpo frequencies are shown as stars in figure [ qpo - hc_fig ] . in the asm and pca light",
    "curves the mjd 51250 observation is clearly visible as a dip ( see figures [ asm_fig ] and [ lc_fig ] ) , with a count rate of only @xmath25150 counts s@xmath18 , compared to @xmath28200 counts s@xmath18 on mjd 51249 and @xmath27025 counts s@xmath18 on mjd 51253 .",
    "this dip is strongest at low energies , causing a hardening of the spectrum a ( see figure [ lc_fig ] ) .",
    "figure [ transition_fig ] shows the 260 kev light curve and the color curves of the mjd 51254 observation .",
    "clearly visible is the jump in count rate that occurred around 1100 s after the start of the observation .",
    "the soft color seemed to be unaffected by this change , and though the hard color showed a small change ( @xmath210% ) it was more gradual than the change in count rate .",
    "it should be noted that the observed transition is not related to the temporary gain change that was applied to the pca later during this observation ( around t=3100 s ; not shown here ) .",
    "figure [ obs-58_fig ] shows the power spectra from before ( 01000 s ) and after ( 15003000 s ) the jump in the 260 and 13.160 kev bands .",
    "the 260 kev power spectrum before the jump showed a broad noise component around a few hz , that was fitted with a power law with an exponential cutoff .",
    "it had a strength ( 1100 hz ) of 6.7@xmath160.1% rms , a power law index ( @xmath19 ) of @xmath200.7@xmath160.1 , and a cutoff frequency of 3.9@xmath160.3 hz . in the 13.160 kev band",
    "the strength of this component was 12.5@xmath21% rms .",
    "in that same band we found a qpo at 9.8@xmath160.1 hz , with an rms amplitude of 8.6@xmath22% and a fwhm of 3.2@xmath160.5 hz . the post - jump 260 kev power spectrum showed a similar noise component as before the jump , though somewhat weaker ( 4.7@xmath160.1% rms ) , with two qpos superimposed on it , at 3.17@xmath160.02 hz and 6.14@xmath160.03 hz . these qpos had rms amplitudes and fwhm of 2.3@xmath160.1% and 0.71@xmath160.06 hz ( 3.17 hz qpo ) , and 3.08@xmath160.08% and 1.23@xmath160.06 hz ( 6.14 hz qpo ) , respectively . in the post jump",
    "26.5 kev power spectrum an additional qpo at 1.77@xmath160.04 hz was found ( 3.7@xmath23 ) when the high count rate part was selected . both before and after the transition power law noise was present : respectively , 3.4@xmath160.2% rms with @xmath24 ( before ) and 3.8@xmath160.1% rms with @xmath25 ( after ) .",
    "the fast transition in the power spectrum can be seen in figure [ dyn - trans_fig ] , which shows the dynamical power spectrum in the 13.160 kev band . the time scale for the change in the power spectrum is similar to that of the transition in the 260 kev light curve .",
    "it was not possible to track the qpo across the transition since it became weaker during the transition .",
    "@xcite and @xcite classified the power spectrum after the jump as type b. indeed , the strengths of the 3 and 6 hz qpos were consistent with those in the other type b observations .",
    "on the other hand , the q - value of the 6 hz qpo was only 5 , and the 5% rms noise component under the qpos was not seen in other type b observations . the type of the power spectrum before the jump is not clear either .",
    "the hardness of that part of the observation suggests type b or c , but the q - value of the 9.8 hz qpo was only @xmath23 .",
    "the strength of that qpo was lower than that of the type b and c 6 hz qpos in the same energy band ( @xmath211% rms ) , but higher than that of the type b and c 12 hz qpos ( 56% rms ) .",
    "since the power spectrum showed a strong noise component , and the 260 kev count rate was lower than that of the type b part it was most likely of type c. the qpo frequencies of both parts are shown in figure [ qpo - hc_fig ] ( the part before [ hc=0.205 ] as type c , the part after [ hc=0.195 ] as type b ) .",
    "the exceptional cases of low frequency qpos presented in this section clearly demonstrate that the a , b ( and c ) classification . which works well for the majority of the observations , is not able to unambiguously describe all of them.the characteristics on which this classification is based ( q - value , harmonic content , time lags ) show strong correlations , but deviations from the usual correlations do occur .",
    "during several observations in the vhs ( branch ii ) , qpos were found with frequencies between 100 and 300 hz .",
    "an example can be seen in figure [ high - freq_fig ] , which shows the 284 hz qpo found in the power spectrum of mjd 51241 .",
    "the frequencies of the high frequency qpos ( @xmath26 ) are given in table [ types_tab ] , and the locations in the cd of the observations in which they were found are indicated in figure [ cd - khz_fig ] . note that we only report qpos whose single - trial significance exceeds 3@xmath23 .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ cd - khz_fig ] that @xmath26 is related to the location in the cd .",
    "it decreased from 284 hz to 102 hz as the source moved up branch ii , and increased again to 280 when it moved down this branch .",
    "figure [ qpo - hc_fig ] more clearly shows that @xmath26 decreased as the hard color increased . in the high energy bands , the qpos tended to be stronger when they had a frequency around 280 hz , as can be seen from table [ types_tab ] .",
    "the q - values of the qpos were not related to those of the low frequency qpos , and had values between 5.6 and 13 .",
    "we measured time lags for the @xmath2282 hz qpo in the combined fourier spectra of the observations on mjds 51241 , 51242 , and 51255 .",
    "lags were measured between three energy bands , in the frequency range 272292 hz .",
    "all lags were consistent with being zero : 0.00@xmath160.11 ms ( 26.5 kev and 6.513.1 kev ) , @xmath200.08@xmath160.13 ms ( 26.5 kev and 13.160 kev ) , and @xmath200.08@xmath160.04 ms ( 6.513.1 kev and 13.160 kev ) , where a positive number means that the photons in the second band lag those in the first one . a time lag analysis of the low frequency qpos in the vhs ( branch ii ) can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "figure [ low - high - qpo_fig ] shows the frequency of several low frequency qpos ( @xmath27 ) plotted against @xmath26 , for those observations where they were detected simultaneously .",
    "we also included the values for the high frequency qpo that was observed on branch iii ( represented by the diamond ; see section [ decay_sec ] ) .",
    "the 123 hz qpo on mjd 51254 was only found in the data taken after the count rate jump ( section [ type - spec_sec ] ) .",
    "this data included a @xmath2600 s interval ( with different pca gain settings ) that was not used for the analysis of the low frequency qpos in figure [ qpo - hc_fig ] .",
    "the low frequency qpos plotted at @xmath28 hz in figure [ low - high - qpo_fig ] therefore have a slightly different frequency than those of the same observation in figure [ qpo - hc_fig ] . four lines could be fitted to the data points , with the first , third and fourth line having slopes that were , respectively , 0.50@xmath160.02 , 2.17@xmath160.10 , and 4.3@xmath160.5 times the slope of the second line .",
    "this is consistent with the four lines representing the fundamental and second , fourth and eighth harmonics .",
    "note that the four lines do not pass through the origin and cross each other around @xmath29 hz and @xmath30 hz . the only two points that were not fitted by these four lines were the sixth harmonic in the mjd 51245 observation ( @xmath26=178 hz ) and the sixteenth harmonic in mjd 51250 observation ( @xmath26=102 hz ) .",
    "these components were only observed once , and therefore no fits could be made .",
    "the four lines can be used to connect the low frequency qpos in figure [ qpo - hc_fig ] .",
    "for example , using the second line in figure [ low - high - qpo_fig ] , it can be seen that the type a - i 1012 hz qpos are related to the type a - ii 89 hz qpos , the type b @xmath26 hz qpos , the 3.1 hz ( type b ? ) qpo on mjd 51254 , and the 1.7 hz type c qpo on mjd 51250 .",
    "the qpos that lie on the second line in figure [ low - high - qpo_fig ] , and those that based on similarities in the power spectrum and hard color are expected to , have been represented by the filled symbols in figure [ qpo - hc_fig ] .",
    "the filled symbols show that the frequency of the low frequency qpos decreases with hard color , like that of the high frequency qpo .",
    "on mjd 51260 ( indicated by begin in figure [ cd_fig]b ) the power spectrum showed no qpos ; it could be fitted with a single power law , with a strength of 0.76@xmath160.05% rms and an index of 1.1@xmath160.01 .",
    "this weak noise , the absence of qpos , and the relatively soft colors suggest that the source had returned to the hs .",
    "the power spectrum of the next observation ( mjd 51261 ) showed a noise component with a similar strength ( 0.56@xmath160.07% rms ) , but also a qpo at 17.0@xmath31 hz , with a fwhm of 2.5@xmath32 and a rms amplitude of 1.02@xmath33% . based on the hardness at which this qpo is found , its frequency , and its fwhm",
    ", it may be related to the 15.6/17.9 hz qpo that was found in the flare / interflare observations during mjd 5117051237 ( see section [ rise ] ) . in the next few observations ( mjd 5126351267 ) no qpo around 17 hz was found , and the power spectra could be fitted with single power laws , with strengths between 0.4% and 1.2% rms , typical for hs .",
    "on mjd 51269 the source had started to move up branch iii .",
    "two qpos were found in the power spectrum of that observation : at 4.54@xmath160.15 hz ( 1.7@xmath160.2% rms , fwhm=1.5@xmath34 hz ) and 9.6@xmath160.6 hz ( 2.0@xmath35% rms , fwhm=4.5@xmath36 hz ) . the noise at low frequencies was fitted with a single power law , with a strength of 1.32@xmath160.07% rms and an index of 0.8@xmath160.1 . based on their q - values ,",
    "the qpos are either of type a - i or a - ii ; the strength of the qpos ( and their frequency ) suggests type a - ii , whereas the detection of an harmonic suggest type a - i ( see section [ type - a_sec ] ) .",

    "their power spectra were very similar .",
    "the mjd 51270 power spectrum showed a qpo at 8.9@xmath160.1 hz ( 1.8@xmath37% rms , fwhm=2.1@xmath31 hz ) and a broad peak around 2 hz that was fitted with a gaussian at 1.8@xmath160.1 hz ( 3.2@xmath160.2% rms , fwhm=2.9@xmath160.4 hz ) plus an exponentially cutoff power law ( 4.4@xmath160.3% rms , @xmath381.6@xmath160.6 , @xmath391 hz ) .",

    "the strength of the 0.011 hz noise , which was fitted with a power law , was @xmath21.5% rms , but it should be noted that some of the power in the 0.011 hz range was absorbed by the gaussian and the exponentially cutoff power law .",
    "the two @xmath29 hz qpos had relatively high q - values ( 4.2 and 6.5 ) , which suggests that they were of type b ; this seems to be confirmed by the shape of the power spectra at higher energies ; figure [ obs_72_fig ] shows the 6.560 kev power spectrum of mjd 51271 , which could be fitted with a power law and qpos at 3.1@xmath160.1 hz , 5.7@xmath160.2 hz , 9.0@xmath160.1 hz , and 12.5@xmath161.0 hz .",

    "the combined mjd 5129951306 ( bottom part of branch v , sc@xmath420.6 ) power spectrum was fitted with a power law with an rms amplitude of 8.9@xmath161.0% and an index of 0.7@xmath160.1 .",

    "in this section we present a discussion of our results .",
    "we start by briefly summarizing the results . after that the source states and power spectra are discussed .      in the period of 1998 november 22 to 1999",
    "may 20 xte j1550564 showed a wide variety of behavior . to organize the different phenomena and relate them to each other , it is useful to compare the rapid time variability and the energy spectra .",
    "an initial division of the observations can be made based on the strength of the broad band ( 1/128128 hz ) power , which is shown in figure [ noise_curve_fig]b .",
    "it can be seen that the source alternated between states with low power ( a few percent rms ) and states with high power ( more than a few percent ) . when comparing this figure with figure [ lc_fig ] it is obvious that observations with high power were mainly found when the spectrum was hard .",
    "these spectrally hard states appeared as branches ( i  v ) in the color - color ( fig .",
    "[ cd_fig ] ) and hardness - intensity ( fig .",
    "[ hid_fig ] ) diagrams . from the hardness - intensity diagram",
    "it is apparent that the hard branches occurred at five distinct count rate levels , and that they were separated by periods that were spectrally soft(er ) ; in the color - color diagram the hard branches lay more or less parallel to the power law curve .",
    "the power spectra on the five hard branches often showed qpos , and in some cases also strong peaked and/or band limited noise ( fig .",
    "[ qpo - types_fig ] ) .",
    "these properties classify the observations on the branches as vhs , is , or ls .",
    "the power spectra that were not on the hard branches showed noise with strength of a few percent rms and , when combined , a weak qpo around 17 hz ( fig .",
    "[ fl - int_pow_fig ] ) .",
    "these observations can be classified as hs ; in the color - color diagram they lay close to the disk blackbody curve .",
    "when the source moved up a hard branch the low frequency noise changed from a weak power law to strong band - limited . on branch",
    "ii this change was accompanied by the qpos changing from the broad type a , to the narrow types b and c ( fig .",
    "[ qpo - hc_fig ] ) . on branches",
    "ii and iii we also found high frequency qpos in the 102284 hz range .",
    "their frequencies were anti - correlated with the hardness of the energy spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ qpo - hc_fig ] ) , and correlated with the frequency of the type a , b , and c low frequency qpos ( fig .",
    "[ low - high - qpo_fig ] ) .      in recent years",
    "the picture of black hole behavior that emerged from observations was consistent with a one - dimensional scheme , in which four canonical source states were linked by one parameter , usually taken to be the mass accretion rate ( see , e.g. @xcite and @xcite for recent elaborations on this view ) . in the context of two - component spectral models ,",
    "often interpreted in terms of emission from an accretion disk and a hot comptonizing medium , this implies that both components contribute to the energy spectrum and power spectrum in amounts that depend strictly on this parameter ; if both components were to vary independently , the description of the phenomenology would have to be at least two - dimensional .",
    "xte j1550564 seems to provide evidence for such two - dimensional behavior .",
    "although the source was observed in all four canonical states , their occurrence was more complex than expected on the basis of a simple relation with the mass accretion rate .",
    "we start by discussing the relation between the source states and the position of the source in the cd and hid ( see figures [ cd_fig ] and [ hid_fig ] ) .",
    "the motion of the source through the cd was along branches .",
    "one branch ( hereafter the soft branch ) lay parallel to the dbb curve in the cd , and quite close to it ( fig [ cd_fig]a ) .",
    "whenever xte j1550564 was on or close to this branch ( e.g. flares 1 - 5 ) , it could be classified as being in the hs : it showed soft energy spectra , and the ( power law - like ) low frequency noise had a strength of only a few percent rms . all the other branches ( hereafter hard branches ) lay approximately parallel to the power law curve in the cd . in time , these hard branches were traced out one after the other , and all but the last two were clearly separated from each other by intervals that showed hs behavior . when the source was on a hard branch it was in the vhs , is or ls : the energy spectrum was hard , and the power spectrum showed qpos and/or strong noise .",
    "the hard branches were similar to each other in that the shape of the noise changed from power law like to band limited as the source moved up such a branch ( i.e. when it became harder ) .",
    "when the source was on a hard branch still relatively close to the soft branch it would , based on the energy and power spectrum , usually be classified as being in the canonical hs - only further up the hard branches full - fledged vhs , is and ls behaviour emerged .",
    "canonical ls ( variability ) behavior was only found at the top of branch v , the branch that reached the hardest colors .",
    "although the observations on hard branches i , iii , and iv were classified as is , and those on hard branch ii as vhs , they had in fact very similar properties , the only difference being the count rate at which they were observed .",
    "this was already found for the is and vhs in other sources , e.g. , gs 112468 and gx 339 - 4 @xcite .",
    "we therefore regard the vhs as an instance of the is , but just the one that happens to be the brightest .",
    "the behavior on the hard branches that were traced out before our observations , during the first part of the outburst , was similar to that during our observations @xcite . during the first part of the outburst ls behavior ( strong band limited noise with a break around 0.1 hz )",
    "was observed only when the hardness was similar to that at the top of branch v ( at the start of the outburst , when the count rate was @xmath2100 times as high as on branch v ) .",
    "moreover , the source evolved from ls to the hs via a vhs ( or is as we shall henceforth call it ) , clearly showing the same ordering of states ( as a function hardness ) as during our observations .",
    "the above shows that as the hardness increased the source evolved from the hs via the is , to the ls ; the hard branches therefore corresponded to hs@xmath0is@xmath0ls transitions , or at least attempts to , since not every branch reached the ls and the source did not always return completely to the hs .",
    "similar conclusions were also drawn by @xcite , on the basis of a comparative study of 10 black hole candidates .",
    "they found that the vhs and is were spectrally intermediate to the hs and ls , and also that as the hardness increases the noise switches from hs - like to ls - like .",
    "they also concluded that transitions between the hs and ls could take place at luminosities / count rates both above and below that of the hs . in our observations transitions between hs and",
    "is were found at around 8000 , 1200 , 600 , and 200 counts s@xmath18 ( see fig . [ hid_fig ] ) ; transitions between is and ls were found at around 40 ( fig .",
    "[ hid_fig ] ) and 4000 counts s@xmath18 ( during the first part of the outburst ) .",
    "moreover we observed hs behavior at all count rate between 200 and 10000 count s@xmath18 .",
    "all this argues against a one - dimensional description of the state transitions as a function of the mass accretion rate .",
    "the observations of xte j1550564 contradict the old picture of black hole states , in which hard states are only found at the highest and lowest count rates .",
    "xte j1550564 clearly shows that hard states can be observed at any count rate level .",
    "however , some remarks should be made .",
    "all the hard states ( i  v ) were observed during the decay of the source ( i during the decay of the first part of the outburst , ii ",
    "v during the decay of the second part ) .",
    "also , the intervals between branches ii  iv , although they could be classified as hs , had significantly harder spectra than the hs observations during the rise , which were extremely soft .",
    "this suggests that the conditions for the presence of the hard spectral component are more favorable during the decay or phases of low count rate .",
    "this is supported by the fact that all small flares ( 15 ) were observed at count rates higher than that of the hard branches .",
    "the fact that these flares did not develop into real transitions suggests that the conditions for transitions and development of the hard spectral component are less favorable at the highest count rates .",
    "also , it can be argued that the only ls that was observed during our observations was found at the lowest count rates at the end of the outburst , as expected in the canonical picture of black hole states . on the other hand ,",
    "a ls was also found during the first part of the outburst when the count rate was at least a factor 100 higher than during the ls at the end of the outburst , clearly showing that ls is not only found at the lowest count rates .",
    "based on the cd , hid , and power spectral fits one gets the impression that the behavior of xte j1550564 is two - dimensional , i.e. at least two ( observable ) parameters are needed two describe the appearance of the source and to account for the occurrence of the different states .",
    "phenomenologically , the two parameters describing this two - dimensional behavior are the count rate and the spectral hardness .",
    "a schematic representation of the behavior of xte j1550564 in terms of these parameters is shown in figure [ diagram_fig ] .",
    "it shows that the states are arranged in a comb - like topology , with the soft ( hs ) branch being the spine , and the hs@xmath0is@xmath0ls transitions being represented by the teeth .",
    "note that the parameter on the vertical axis is the logarithm of the count rate , and that we decided to show the hard branches as horizontal lines ; for reasons of clarity we did not depict the exact movement of the source through the diagram .",
    "we also included the location of the flares , which occurred at count rates higher than that of the brightest hard branch .",
    "the most important aspect of xte j1550564 is probably the fact that two observable parameters ( count rate and hardness ) varied too a large extent independently from each other .",
    "this suggests that at least two physical parameters underlie this behavior , since this complex behavior is hard to explain within a framework where the appearance of the source is determined by a only single physical parameter ( e.g. only mass accretion rate ) .",
    "physically the two underlying parameters might for example be the mass accretion rate through the disk ( roughly increasing with count rate , at least in the hs ) and the size of a comptonizing medium ( increasing with spectral hardness ) . in that case the state of the source is determined by the ( relative ) size of the comptonizing medium , with it being small or absent in the hs and growing in size towards the ls .",
    "the fact that we see increases in the spectral hardness at many count rate levels suggests that the size of this medium , and therefore also the state of the source , is to a large degree not determined by the accretion rate through the disk .",
    "we note that the inner disc radius as derived from variability properties ( i.e. qpo frequencies , see section [ disc_low_sec ] ) correlates well with hardness , suggesting that the comptonizing medium grows as the inner disk edge moves out .",
    "the two physical parameters do not necessarily vary completely independently from each other .",
    "for instance , changes in one parameter may be triggered by changes in the other , and certain values of one parameter may restrict the value of the other parameter ( e.g. in between the hard branches xte j1550564 seemed to become slightly harder towards lower count rates ( fig .",
    "[ hid_fig ] ) ) .",
    "while previous authors , inspired by the description of black hole spectra in terms of two components , have also discussed black hole phenomenology in terms of two - dimensional diagrams @xcite , the overall picture has in our view been considerably clarified by the clues provided by xte j1550564 described in this paper .",
    "the basic phenomenology seems to be one where the hard and soft component can vary to a large extent independently from each other .",
    "the hs is the name we have given in the past to all cases where the hard component is weak compared to the soft component , and the is / vhs and ls are unified into cases where the hard component is , respectively , comparable to or dominating the soft component .",
    "the difference between the vhs and is is reduced to a difference in the luminosity of the soft component at which they occur , and the difference between is / vhs and ls is caused by differences in the relative contributions of the soft and hard components .",
    "this two - dimensional interpretation might very well be applicable to all black hole candidates showing the canonical states .",
    "the often observed order of states ( vhs@xmath52hs@xmath52is@xmath52ls ) is still consistent with the diagram drawn figure [ diagram_fig ] .",
    "the fact that black hole state behavior often seems one - dimensional can be explained by considering how the behavior of xte j1550564 would have appeared if the data were of lower quality , the source sampling was more infrequent , its distance was larger , and if it had different characteristic time scales for variations in the soft and hard component .",
    "much of its subtle behavior would have been missed or may have been misinterpreted .",
    "it is mainly thanks to the combination of source brightness , the quality of the rxte / pca data , and the excellent source sampling that we clearly see the two - dimensional nature of its behavior . since the observations of xte j1550564 strongly suggest that mass accretion rate through the disk and state are decoupled , it would be possible to see transients that remain in the same state during a whole outburst",
    "moreover , one could also see state transitions in sources with a more or less constant mass accretion rate .",
    "suggestions of such behavior have been seen in , respectively , gs 2023 + 338 @xcite and cyg x-1 ( @xcite , however see @xcite ) .",
    "the radio brightness of xte j1550564 during the mjd 51248 atca observations indicates that an outflow event was going on or had recently occurred .",
    "the spectral index suggests that the radio source was optically thin , and observed during the decay of such an outflow event .",
    "this event might be associated with the state change on mjd 51237/51239 ( the onset of branch ii ) .",
    "although xte j1550564 was observed in radio only once ( on branch ii ) , observations of other black hole candidates @xcite suggest that radio emission is associated with spectrally hard states .",
    "the hard branches may therefore correspond to changes in the accretion flow geometry , where an inflow ( hs ) is gradually accompanied by ( or changing into ) an outflow ( ls ) .",
    "jet - like outflow models have already been proposed for the vhs in gx 3394 by @xcite .",
    "although not always observable in individual observations , qpos were found on all branches , except for the last one .",
    "several types were found : 118 hz qpos on the hard branches ( type a , b , and c ) , 1518 hz ( plus an harmonic ) on the soft / hs branch and in the flares , and 100285 hz qpos on the two brightest hard branches .",
    "high frequency qpos in black hole candidates are a relatively new phenomenon .",
    "previous to xte j1550564 , they were found in grs 1915 + 105 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hz ) and in gro j1655 - 40 (",
    "@xcite found high frequency qpos in xte j1550564 in the 161238 hz range , during the first part of the outburst . with the observations of the second part of the outburst this range",
    "has been expanded to 100285 hz .",
    "it is obvious that the frequency of the high frequency qpos in xte j1550564 can not be explained by models that predict an approximately constant frequency , e.g. orbital motion at the innermost stable orbit @xcite , lense - thirring precession at the innermost stable orbit @xcite , or trapped - mode disk oscillations @xcite .",
    "the high frequency qpo was found on two branches ; between 100 and 285 hz on branch ii , and at 251 hz on branch iii .",
    "the count rates at which it was observed , were much lower on branch iii ( @xmath21350 counts s@xmath18 ) than on branch ii ( @xmath24700 - 8300 counts s@xmath18 ) , which shows that the qpo frequency does not strongly depend on the count rate .",
    "a similar effect is also seen for the high frequency qpos in some neutron star x - ray binaries @xcite , where the frequency varies along parallel branches in a frequency  count rate diagram .",
    "a certain frequency can therefore be observed at different count rate levels , and a range of frequencies can be found within a relatively small range of count rates .",
    "this suggests that if the qpo frequency is related to a certain ( variable ) radius , this radius varies almost independently from the count rate ( and probably mass accretion rate ; @xcite ) .",
    "similar two - dimensional behavior as discussed in section [ states_sec ] may therefore also be present in some of the neutron star sources .",
    "an obvious question to ask is , whether the high frequency qpos in black hole candidates have the same origin as the kilohertz qpos that are observed in the neutron star sources ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "of course , since the qpos in the neutron star sources are often observed in pairs , only one ( if any ) of those two qpos can have the same origin as the qpos in black hole sources , which until now have always appeared as single peaks .",
    "it is , however , not clear which of the two qpos that would be ; both the lower and upper khz qpo have q - values and the rms energy spectra that are consistent with those of the qpo in xte j1550564 .",
    "the frequency ranges in which the high frequency qpos are observed are 102284 hz for the qpo in xte j1550 - 564 , and 2001070 hz for the lower khz qpo , and 3251330 for the upper khz qpo in the neutron stars .",
    "here we combined the khz qpo data for all neutron star sources in @xcite . although the lower and upper khz qpos cover a frequency range of a factor of 5.4 and 4.1 , respectively , the values for individual neutron star sources are more like that found for xte j1550564 ( @xmath22.8 ) .",
    "although the high frequency qpo in xte j1550564 has parameters that are consistent with those of both the lower and upper khz qpo ( within a simple orbital frequency model ) , a major difference between xte j1550564 and the neutron star sources is the fact that the latter often show two high frequency qpos .",
    "however , this could be explained if one of the two khz qpos in the neutron star sources is due to a mechanism that requires the presence of a solid surface .",
    "on all the hard branches , except branch v , qpos were found with frequencies between 1 and 18 hz . due to the low count rates",
    "the quality of the power spectra on branch v was poor , and the presence of qpos could therefore not be ruled out .",
    "the frequencies of the qpos were not constant , as can be seen from figure [ qpo - hc_fig ] ( showing the qpos found on branch ii ) , but it is not immediately clear from that figure how the frequency of the low frequency qpos ( @xmath27 ) depended on the hard color ( which is a good measure of the distance along the branch ) . although the figure is suggestive of a positive correlation , especially for hc@xmath420.015 , the behavior of the low frequency qpos during the rise of the first part of the outburst of xte j1550564 ( anti - correlation with hardness ; @xcite ) and the correlation found between the low and high frequency qpos ( see below , and figure [ low - high - qpo_fig ] ) lead us to believe that hard color and frequency were anti - correlated , and that the frequencies of both the high and low frequency qpos decreased as the source moved up branch ii .",
    "this contradicts the switch from a correlation into anti - correlation when the hard color passes a certain value , that was reported by @xcite for other black hole candidates .",
    "we want to stress again that the fact that several harmonics were present and that not always the same harmonic was the strongest one , can easily lead to confusion . on the other hard branches",
    "not enough qpos were observed to confirm the anti - correlation with hardness .",
    "it was usually the qpo that happened to be located between 5 and 8 hz that was the strongest in the 260 kev power spectra of branch ii , even though it could be identified with different harmonic components ( as can be seen from figures [ qpo - hc_fig ] and [ low - high - qpo_fig ] ) .",
    "perhaps variations within that frequency range are less prone to damping than outside , or a resonance occurs .",
    "the shoulder component that was present at a frequency of 1.25 times that of the 58 hz type b qpos , has been found before in qpos in other black hole candidates like gs 112468 and gx 3394 @xcite , but recently also in the 20 - 50 hz qpos in the neutron star system gx 340 + 0 @xcite .",
    "figures [ qpo - hc_fig ] and [ low - high - qpo_fig ] seem to indicate that the low frequency qpos evolve from type a via type b into type c , and vice versa . on branch",
    "ii the type a qpos were located at the bottom of the branch , and the those of type b and c further along it .",
    "this was also seen on branch iii for type a and b ( figs .",
    "[ decay - pds_fig ] and [ obs_72_fig ] ) , and to certain extent also on branch i , where indications for type b qpos were found at a similar hardness as where they were found on branch ii ( fig .",
    "[ obs1_fit_fig ] ) .",
    "no direct transitions between type a and b were seen , so it is not known whether such transitions are smooth or abrupt . in the mjd 51254 observation a jump in the count rate was accompanied by a change in the power spectrum that may have been a transition from type c to b. this suggests that the transitions between the different types are quite sudden .",
    "apart from the difference in spectral hardness at which type a and b occurred , it is clear that there are at least two other fundamental differences between the two types .",
    "first there is the difference in the q - value , which is higher in type b. this might also explain why more harmonics are detected in the type b power spectra , since narrower features are easier to identify .",
    "second , there is the difference in time lag spectra @xcite , which can not be reconciled even when one compares the time lags of similar harmonics ( i.e. , the type a - i 12 hz qpo and the type b 6 hz qpo , which in our view are supposed to be the same harmonic , still have the opposite signs for their time lags ) .",
    "as mentioned already in section [ vhs ] the type a qpos were divided in two types , a - i and a - ii .",
    "figure [ qpo - hc_fig ] shows that type a - ii qpos ( triangles ) were found both at higher and lower hardness than type a - i ( circles ) .",
    "the a - ii subtype should therefore be regarded as a collective rather than a real type .",
    "the two filled triangles ( hc@xmath20.012 ) can be identified with second harmonics and are for that reason different from the a - i observations , where the fundamental was the dominant harmonic .",
    "the nature of the two observations represented by the open triangles in figure [ qpo - hc_fig ] remains uncertain ; their frequency is lower than expected on the basis of their hardness and in one case an addiational broad bump was observed in the power spectrum .",
    "we found that the frequencies of the high frequency qpos and low frequency qpos that were detected simultaneously are well correlated ( fig .",
    "[ low - high - qpo_fig ] ) ; it is mainly on the basis of this that we conclude that the different types ( a , b , and c ) of low frequency qpos have the same origin .",
    "similar correlations have also been found for the low and high frequency qpos in a number of neutron star source ( e.g. @xcite ) and in neutron star and black hole sources for qpos and broad noise components @xcite .",
    "the main correlation that was found for the neutron star and black hole sources extended over a frequency range of 0.11200 hz , and was consistent with the relation @xmath53 , that was found in the neutron star z sources @xcite .",
    "a second correlation was present in figure 2 of @xcite that was fitted with @xmath54 by @xcite for data of 4u 172834 .",
    "both relations are plotted in figure [ low - high - qpo_fig ] ( dashed and dotted lines , respectively ) , and are apparently not consistent with the data of xte j1550564 .",
    "the fact that the data in figure [ low - high - qpo_fig ] are well fitted with four linear relations that do not pass through the origin excludes models in which @xmath27 and @xmath26 are related by a simple power law expression .",
    "the four linear fits to the data in figure [ low - high - qpo_fig ] cross each other at @xmath550 hz and @xmath56 75 hz .",
    "it is not clear what the nature of this @xmath275 hz frequency in a black hole system could be .",
    "low frequency qpos were also found on the soft branch ( 15.6 hz ) and in the high state flares ( 17.9 hz ) .",
    "they were much weaker than the low frequency qpos found on the hard branches and had a rather high q - value ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "their frequency was apparently correlated with hard color ( assuming that we observed the same harmonical component ) , unlike that of the hard branch qpos .",
    "the above suggests that the 15.6 hz and 17.9 hz qpos may have a different origin than the type a , b and c qpos , and it may also explain why the only 18 hz qpo ( mjd 51239 ) reported by @xcite did not follow the relation between qpo properties and the spectral parameters seen on the hard branches . on the other hand , there some clues that do suggest a relation with the type a , b , and c qpos : when their values would be plotted in figure [ qpo - hc_fig ] they would lie close to the extrapolation of a line through the filled symbols .",
    "moreover , the 15.6 hz and the 17.9 hz qpo both fall on the empirical relation found by @xcite for the low frequency qpo and break frequency found in many types of x - ray binaries , including black holes .",
    "hence , it is not clear whether these qpo really have a different origin than the a , b , and c type qpos , or that they only have appear to be different because the hard spectral component is so much weaker .",
    "the properties of the 1618 hz qpo are in fact remarkably similar to those of the 1423 hz qpo in gro j1655564 , studied by @xcite ; the similarity extends to the frequency at which they are found , their amplitude , and their relation with the disk spectral parameters . note the apparent switch from a correlation of qpo frequency with hardness ( 15.6 hz and 17.9 hz qpos ) to an anticorrelation ( a , b and c types ) is probably not related the one reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see above ) .",
    "they did not find qpos in such spectrally soft states , and the frequencies of the 15.6/17.9 hz qpos are still well above that of most a , b , and c type qpos .",
    "the range over which the fundamental of the low frequency qpos is observed in xte j1550564 is 0.1 hz to 6 hz ( which includes the qpos reported by @xcite , but not the 1618 hz qpos discussed in the previous paragraph ) . using the expression for the lowest line in figure [ low - high - qpo_fig ] , @xmath57 , and assuming that the high frequency qpo is due to orbital motion at inner disc radius ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 , one can estimate the corresponding changes in the inner disc radius . for the low frequency qpo changing from 0.1 to 6 hz",
    "we find a decrease in @xmath58 by a factor 2.6 , which is comparable to what was found by @xcite for other black hole systems .",
    "however , their relation between @xmath58 and @xmath27 was based on the empirical relation between @xmath27 and @xmath26 found for neutron star sources by @xcite . using the relation of @xcite",
    "we find a decrease in @xmath58 by factor @xmath24.2 .",
    "both numbers suggest that the inner radius changes are rather small when a black hole changes from a hard ( where the 0.1 hz qpo was observed ) to a much softer state ( where the 6 hz qpo was observed ) .",
    "it should be noted that these changes may in fact be somewhat larger if the 15.6/17.9 hz qpo turns out to be related to the a , b , and c type qpos , and/or if the lowest peak in the @xcite power spectra is not the fundamental , but a higher harmonic .",
    "there are two types of low frequency qpos in the neutron star z sources @xcite that may be compared with the low frequency qpos in xte j1550564 ( and other black hole candidates ) : these are the horizontal branch qpos ( hbo ) and the normal branch qpos ( nbo ) ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "similar qpos have also been found in a number of neutron star atoll sources .",
    "of the two qpo types in z sources it is the hbo that bears most resemblance to the qpos in xte j1550564 . unlike nbos",
    ", hbos have a strong harmonic content ; e.g. , in gx 340 + 0 the hbos could be fitted with three harmonically related peaks ( 1st , 2nd and 4th ) plus a shoulder component for the second harmonic @xcite , similar to the type b qpos in xte j1550564 .",
    "hbos are found in the 1560 hz range , and their frequency changes smoothly ; nbos are found in the 620 hz range , but their frequency changes are strongly related to sudden spectral / state changes . although the 620 hz range of the nbos is closer to the values we found for the low frequency qpos in xte j1550564 , it should be noted that if one scales the frequency of those low frequency qpos with a factor @xmath25 ( which is maximum @xmath60 in the neutron star sources divided by the maximum @xmath26 in xte j1550564 ) , one gets values that are similar to those found for the hbo .",
    "another indication that the qpos in xte j1550564 are related to the hbos ( at least to the hbos in the z source gx 17 + 2 @xcite ) is the fact that they are both observed when a hard power law tail is present in the energy spectrum , and that both show an anti - correlation between their frequency and the strength of this high energy component .",
    "finally we note that the hbo in z sources is accompanied by a low frequency noise component that becomes stronger when the hbo frequency decreases , which is similar to what is observed in xte j1550564 , where a strong noise component develops when the qpo frequency drops ( see also figures in @xcite and @xcite ) .    when comparing the properties of the 0.010.1 hz noise in the high state flares with those in between the flares , we find that in the flares the noise was stronger , but had a softer fractional rms spectrum , whereas the overall x - ray spectrum of the source was harder .",
    "though this might at first appear remarkable , it is in perfect agreement with the assumption that the extra noise is associated with the hard power law component . a hard spectral component , with associated noise that remains a constant fraction of it , in combination with a soft spectral component that remains unchanged , will lead to a softer fractional spectral dependence of the noise when the hard component increases .",
    "the transition observed on mjd 51254 showed many similarities to the `` dips '' and `` flip - flops '' observed in gx 3394 and gs 112468 @xcite , although the time scale of the transition we observed ( @xmath2100 s ) is quite long compared to the transitions in these dips and flip - flops .",
    "both showed a qpo in their upper count rate level ( but not in their lower level ) , and a somewhat stronger noise in their lower count rate level .",
    "like in gx 3394 and gs 112468 the transition occurred in a region in the cd where power law noise changes to band limited noise . also , the count rate differences ( @xmath210% ) were accompanied by relatively subtle spectral differences , showing that on these short time scales spectral hardness and power spectral properties do not correlate as well as they do on longer time scales .",
    "the transition probably originated in the accretion disc component ; the frequency of the qpos before and after the transition were different and indicate that the inner disk radius had decreased a few percent .",
    "this change did apparently not affect the spectrum of the disk component , since the soft color remained constant .",
    "the hard color on the other hand did change , but certainly not as dramatically as the count rate .",
    "a slow decrease in the hard color started around the time of the transition maybe reflecting some kind of cooling of the hard spectral component .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized as followed :    * xte j1550564 was found to change between spectrally hard and soft states on time scales of days to weeks .",
    "these transition took place at a more or less constant 260 kev count rate level , and were found at count rate levels that differed by up to a factor 1000 .",
    "* as the spectral hardness increased , both the spectral and variability properties changed from hs via is to ls .",
    "we regard the vhs as an instance of the is . * at least two physical parameters seem to be necessary to account for the behavior of xte j1550564 .",
    "these parameters vary to a large extent independently from each other .",
    "one of these parameters is probably the mass accretion rate ( through the disk ) .",
    "the other parameter seems to determine the state of the source and may for instance be the ( relative ) size of a comptonizing region . * the inner disc radius , as inferred from variability porperties , increases by a factor of 34 as the source moves from the hs to the ls . * the properties of the qpos ( frequency , coherence and harmonic content ) as well as the shape and strength of the broad band noise ( weak power law or strong band limited ) are well correlated with spectral hardness . * the frequencies of the low and high frequency qpos correlated well with each other , but in a way that is inconsistent with empirical relations found for the low and high frequency qpos in neutron star systems .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of data of the black hole candidate and x - ray transient xte j1550564 , taken with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ between 1998 </S>",
    "<S> november 22 and 1999 may 20 . during this period the source went through several different states , which could be divided into soft and hard states based on the relative strength of the high energy spectral component . </S>",
    "<S> these states showed up as distinct branches in the color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams , connecting to form a structure with a comb - like topology , the branch corresponding to the soft state forming the spine and the branches corresponding to the various hard states forming the teeth of the comb .    </S>",
    "<S> the power spectral properties of the source were strongly correlated with its position on the branches . </S>",
    "<S> the broad band noise became stronger , and changed from power law like to band limited , as the spectrum became harder . </S>",
    "<S> three types of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) were found : 118 hz and 102284 hz qpos on the hard branches , and 1618 hz qpos on and near the soft branch . </S>",
    "<S> the 118 hz qpos on the hard branches could be divided in three sub - types . </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies of the high and low frequency qpos on the hard branches were correlated with each other , and anti - correlated with spectral hardness . </S>",
    "<S> the changes in qpo frequency suggest that the inner disc radius only increases by a factor of 34 as the source changes from a soft to a hard state .    </S>",
    "<S> our results on xte j1550564 strongly favor a two - dimensional description of black hole behavior , where the regions near the spine of the comb in the color - color diagram can be identified with the high state , and the teeth with transitions from the high state , via the intermediate state ( which includes the very high state ) to the low state , and back . </S>",
    "<S> the two physical parameters underlying this two - dimensional behavior vary to a large extent independently and could for example be the accretion rate through the disk and the size of the comptonizing region causing the hard tail . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the various teeth is then associated with the mass accretion rate through the disk , suggesting that high state @xmath0 low state transitions can occur at any disk mass accretion rate and that these transitions are primarily caused by another , independent parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how this picture could tie in with the canonical , one - dimensional behavior of black hole candidates that has usually been observed . </S>"
