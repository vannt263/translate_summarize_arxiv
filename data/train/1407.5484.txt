    "during mitosis , the cell equally divides into two daughter cells , each getting a copy of the original genetic material .",
    "successful division requires that the two identical sister chromatids of mitotic chromosomes attach to the plus - ends of spindle microtubules ( mts ) via their kinetochores @xcite .",
    "this process is critical because incorrect attachments lead to mitotic errors giving rise to genetic instabilities , also involved in cancer @xcite . to ensure accurate chromosome segregation , correct mt - kinetochore attachments should remain stable while faulty attachments should be destabilized and corrected @xcite .",
    "mts are composed by a number of protofilaments ( pfs ) , typically thirteen , and polymerize by the addition of tubulin dimers in their gtp - bound state .",
    "growing mts switch to a shrinkage phase when all or most gtp - bound tubulin is hydrolysed , a process known as catastrophe , while the switch back to a growing state is known as resuce .",
    "these two processes constitute the _ dynamic instability _ of mts.@xcite .",
    "gtp - hydrolysis also induces a change in conformation of mt protofilaments from a straight to a curved state @xcite which eventually leads to depolymerization , since curved pfs tend to peel from the mt while straight filaments are stable .",
    "indeed electron micrographs of microtubules show that individual pfs can be seen curving outwards from the ends @xcite .",
    "mechanical measurements of the rigidity of mts show that their young s modulus is two orders of magnitude smaller than the shear modulus @xcite .",
    "this implies that tubulin dimers interact strongly along the pf and weakly along the transverse direction .",
    "all these structural , mechanical and kinetic aspects have been included in theoretical and computational models that describe with great accuracy the main features of the stability and dynamic instability of mts @xcite .",
    "mt - kinetochore attachments vary in different organisms , but all seem to share a common feature @xcite : fibrils extending from the kinetochore either link directly to curling mt - pfs , as in most higher eukaryotes @xcite , or fibrils linking to a ring , known as the @xmath01 complex @xcite , form around the attached mt , as in budding yeast @xcite .",
    "once the attachment has been formed , mt depolymerization @xcite provides a force that is strong enough to carry kinetochore - attached loads @xcite , even in the absence of motor proteins .",
    "the precise nature of the attachment between kinetochore fibrils and mts has been the object of intense experimental investigation suggesting that binding occurs through the ndc80 complex which interacts with tubulin by weak electrostatic forces @xcite .",
    "other experiments show that the ndc80 complex acts like a curvature sensor and binds preferentially to straight mt pfs , typical of polymerizing mts @xcite . on the other hand , electron micrographs",

    "@xcite have shown that yeast kinetochores form _ catch - bonds _ with mts .",
    "_ catch - bonds _ become stronger under a pulling force @xcite , thus providing a possible stabilizing mechanism needed for chromosome segregation .",
    "akiyoshi et al . also show that the kinethocore forms _ catch - bonds _ only with depolymerizing mts , whereas it forms standard force - weakening bonds with polymerizing mts @xcite .",
    "the authors encompass this information into a simple two - states kinetic model that is able to fit well the experimentally measured detachment times @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism by which a _ catch - bond _ forms remains , however , still unclear .",
    "it is easy to understand that electrostatic interactions alone , even if protein complexes act cooperatively @xcite , would not give rise to a _ catch - bond _ : pulling charges apart leads to a weakening of the bond and should therefore increase the detachment rate .",
    "thus electrostatic interactions reasonably account for the experimentally observed increase of detachment rate for polymerizing mts under tension , but can not explain at the same time the decreasing detachment rate observed for depolymerizing mts .",
    "models of mt - kinetochore interactions are abundant ranging from the classical sleeve model @xcite to curling models @xcite and syntheses of both @xcite as well as incorporation of motor proteins @xcite , but none of them provide insight into the observed _ catch - bond _ behavior . in this paper , we resolve this puzzle by combining existing experimental evidence into a model of mt - kinetochore attachment that can explain the formation of _ catch - bonds_. we consider the interaction of a microtubule with a set of kinetochore fibrils with tips that can directly bind to straight mt - protofilaments and to neighbor fibril tips as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite for the ndc80 complex .",
    "similarly , the fibrils can be effectively cross linked by other protein complexes as e.g. the @xmath1 complex in budding yeast or the mis12 complex in ptk@xmath2 cells @xcite .",
    "hence , when a polymerizing mt approaches the kinetochore , fibrils attach to its surface due their direct interactions . this attachment is a standard force - weakening bond as expected , but the mutual interactions or cross - linking between fibrils naturally leads to the formation of fibril loops . when mts depolymerize , the direct fibril - mt binding force is strongly suppressed @xcite , but the tips of curling pfs can easily entangle in the fibril loops .",
    "this attachment is now a _",
    "catch - bond _ , since it becomes stronger under tension .",
    "the mechanism we propose is very general and could also involve other kinetochore proteins , such as cenp - e @xcite , cenp - t @xcite , cenp - f @xcite or the ska complex @xcite , rather than just ndc80 , which is too short to account for the fibrils alone .",
    "finally , the entangled organization of the observed in vertebrate kinetochores @xcite , provides another striking example where a velcro - like attachment , such as the one we propose , could naturally take place .",
    "we illustrate the formation of a conformational attachment by three dimensional simulations of a single depolymerizing mt interacting with a set of kinetochore fibrils .",
    "once we are confident that a conformational attachment is formed , we can reduce the computational complexity of the problem by focusing on a two - dimensional representation of the interaction between a pf and a fibril loop .",
    "numerical results of the two dimensional model reproduce with good accuracy the _ catch - bond _ behavior reported experimentally in ref .",
    "we also study the stability of the mt attachment and find that it crucially depends on the local conformation of the mt . by changing the intrinsic curvature of the mt - pf ,",

    "@xcite , low pulling forces increasingly stabilize the pf - fibril attachment .",
    "furthermore , our model predicts that for larger forces the attachment should again be destabilized . to compare the model with experiments , we plot in fig .",

    "hence , at low forces simulations and experiments fit neatly together .",
    "it is , however , unlikely that bond strengthening persists up to larger forces , where elastic deformation of the pf should take place .",
    "indeed , simulations for large forces show that the lifetime of the kinetochore - microtubule attachment  the inverse of @xmath120  displays a peak at @xmath124 10 pn , and decreases very quickly after that , as shown in fig .",

    "the main point of cell division is the segregation of replicated chromosomes into two daughter cells .",
    "this is chiefly executed by the mitotic spindle , consisting of mts , organized into two astral structures whose centres derive from centrosomes and associated proteins .",
    "faithful segregation of the chromosomes requires proper bi - orientation and thus dynamic kinetochore - mt attachments , i.e. it must allow erroneous attachments  kinetochores attached to a mt emanating from the wrong pole  to be corrected . in other words ,",
    "kinetochore - mt attachments can be unstable or stable , short - lived or long - lived .    for a given value of the diffusion amplitude @xmath91 we can vary @xmath47 and plot the detachment times with respect to constant pulling force , we see that the peak height as well as the offset @xmath141 decrease with @xmath47 , and at a critical value the detachment time at zero force @xmath142 is higher than the peak .",
    "decreasing @xmath47 further makes the peak disappear completely and we end up with a detachment curve that is purely exponentially decreasing with applied force . as an example , we plot in fig .",
    "s1a the detachment times for @xmath143 nm @xmath100s@xmath110 for set of values of @xmath47 .",
    "as @xmath47 decreases , the catch bond peak is reduced and is shifted to smaller forces . at a critical value - for @xmath143 nm @xmath100s@xmath110 it is @xmath144 - the peak detachment time is at the same height as the zero - force detachment time @xmath145 .",
    "then , the peak completely disappears for @xmath146 and the detachment curve is a simple exponential decay .",
    "these observations allow us to construct a very simple  phase diagram \" where the transition line corresponds to the condition for which the catch bond disappears . in the stable region",
    "the attachment time increases with small applied forces , while it decreases in the the unstable region .",
    "an example for @xmath112pnnm@xmath39 and @xmath143 is shown in fig s1b . a stable region for @xmath147 ( right dash ) and an unstable region for @xmath148 , which splits into a  weak \" part ( left dash ) where @xmath149 and a truly unstable part ( cross dash ) with no peak at all .",
    "the same procedure can be repeated for different values of @xmath91 , allowing us to construct a phase diagram for the stability of the attachment which we report in fig .",
    "our model for mt - kinetochore attachments captures and explains in easy - to - understand terms several key features of experimentally observed phenomena .",
    "most prominently , we could reproduce the detachment times of mts from kinetochores that are pulled with constant force @xcite . using the model",
    "we simulate the emergence of the _ catch - bond _  the stabilization by tension  of the kinetochore interface with a depolymerizing protofilament , emphasizing the role of the geometrical conformation of the kinetochore - microtubule interface .",
    "we identified different mechanisms of kinetochore - microtubule detachment for straight and curled protofilament tips .    1 .",
    "kinetochore fibrils are attached to straight protofilaments and detach due to thermal activation .",
    "this detachment is facilitated by an applied force , resulting in exponential weakening of the attachment .",
    "neighbor fibrils that have attached to each other form loops into which curling protofilaments hook .",
    "when no external force is applied the loop can escape by thermal fluctuations , i.e. brownian motion .",
    "when the loop and pf - tip are pulled apart , the thermal fluctuations acquire a bias to move preferentially towards the tip of the pf , making an escape from a ram s horn conformation more unlikely , thereby stabilizing the attachment .",
    "however , if the pulling force is too strong , then the ram s horn becomes uncurled or the loop breaks , so that the attachment is destabilized again .",
    "the third point makes an experimental prediction  at higher forces the detachment rate from depolymerizing pfs increases again  that could be easily be confirmed experimentally .",
    "accordingly , one should extend the experiments plotted in figure 4c of ref .",
    "@xcite to measure the detachment rate from depolymerizing mts at higher forces .",
    "the two - state model of akiyoshi et .",
    "implicitly assume that the detachment rate should continue to decrease with applied force , while our model predicts that it should eventually go up .",
    "another prediction that follows from our results is the stabilization of kinetochore - mt attachments via the intrinsic curvature of the mt protofilaments .",
    "the simulations show that the higher the pf curvature the longer the lifetime of the attachment . if the intrinsic curvature is small enough then the stabilization , together with the _ catch - bond _ disappears and the attachment becomes weaker with applied force . in our model",
    "the duration of kinetochore - mt attachments depends heavily on the flexural rigidity and intrinsic curvature of the pfs .",
    "in particular , our model suggests that a variation of the intrinsic curvature @xmath47 can cause a switch between stable / unstable attachments of depolymerizing pfs from kinetochores .",
    "this seems reasonable since there is a broad distribution of bending angles found in experiments @xcite .",
    "although the intrinsic curvature of a pf in isolation would be solely determined by the angle and stiffness between gtp / gdp - tubulin blocks , it is not unreasonable to assume that other factors influence the mechanical properties of protofilaments and so regulates the stability of the kinetochore - mt interface .",
    "our model , therefore , naturally suggests an additional path to vary the type of the attachment from stable to unstable and vice - versa .",
    "this mechanical process can of course be seen as complementary to any other accompanying process , like for example the stability regulation by ndc80 @xcite and aurora b @xcite or the switch of the mt state from growing to shrinking @xcite .",
    "in particular , the breakdown of the catch - bond could also occur according to two additional pathways : ( i ) the dissociation of fibril loops and ( ii ) the fracture of mt - pfs .",
    "a possible hypothesis is that aurora b is responsible for the dissociation of fibril loops as it phosphorylates the terminal ends of the ndc80 complex @xcite . to our best knowledge",
    "the influence of chemical or biological agents on the elastic properties of mts and pfs and their tips has not been studied and it will be exciting to see whether future experiments prove our predictions .      earlier models for the kinetochore - microtubule interface make use of the curling of pfs to show how force can be produced by the geometry of the protofilament @xcite .",
    "these studies focus mainly on the load - bearing capabilities of the pfs and do not go into detail on the mechanism of the coupling to the kinetochore . while our work is building on these insights , we include some very recent experimental results into our model allowing us to explore the kinetochore interface in more detail , and make some specific predictions based on them .",
    "in contrast to the biased - diffusion based hill sleeve @xcite or the motor - protein based @xcite models , our model does not investigate the biochemical aspects of the kinetochore - mt interface , but focus instead on its mechanics .",
    "the biochemical properties of the interface that are needed , i.e. the fibril - tip attachment strength to neighbor fibril tips and the mt surface , are not readily available and have to be fit .",
    "we furthermore investigate slightly different phenomena than solely chromosome transport and breathing for which these models were designed for .",
    "our model sheds light instead on the genesis of the kinetochore - mt interface together with the role of the geometrical conformation of the pf tips .",
    "an approach that is similar in spirit to ours was recently published in ref .",
    "there the authors also model the collective action of kinetochore fibrils on the mts , but the methodology employed is quite different . while in that paper the authors explore the kinetochore - mt interface in a mean - field approximation using rate equations , we simulate directly the movement of each fibril and its interactions with the mt separately and then look at the emergent behavior . tellingly , in both studies the cooperation of kinetochore fibrils is found to be essential to strengthen and stabilize the interface . another difference , of course , is that we explicitly make use of the geometrical details of the protofilament curl and base on it predictions on the emergence of the kinetochore - microtubule interface",
    ".    our results fit neatly between different facets of the study of the kinetochore - microtubule interface and condense established experimental results into a new kind of model .",
    "using molecular and stochastic dynamics simulations , we are able to elucidate and predict some very new aspects of the attachment of kinetochore fibrils to microtubule protofilaments .      in this paper",
    "we introduce a computational model of the kinetochore - microtubule interface based on the synthesis of different experimental observations showing that fibrils extend from the kinetochore and capture mt tips @xcite , kinetochore proteins form entangled networks @xcite , the essential kinetochore protein complex ndc80 interacts in different ways with curved and straight protofilaments @xcite and ndc80 complexes bind to each other @xcite .",
    "hence , we assume that individual kinetochore fibrils are composed by different essential protein - complexes and can be treated as building blocks for the kinetochore - mt interface .",
    "we then employ a three - dimensional mt model treating the tubulin hetero - dimers as wedge shaped blocks that can have two configuration corresponding to gtp and gdp - bound tubulin .",
    "the tubulin blocks organize into protofilaments with intrinsic curvature ( gdp - tubulin ) or without ( gtp - tubulin ) .",
    "the kinetochore fibrils are modelled as bead - spring polymers that can attach to the top - side of straight protofilaments .",
    "the fibril tips also attach to each other forming effective loops into which curling protofilament - tips can hook . the model provides a clear illustration on how the conformation of mt - pfs influence the stability of their attachments with the kinetochore that is quite general and robust . beside its application to the experiments reported in ref .",

    "kinetochore molecules are assumed to form uniform units represented as fibrils , here shown in red .",
    "the tips of the fibrils , dark red , can sense and attach to the outer surface of an incident microtubule ( blue ) if the mt straight , while fibril - tips do not attach directly to mt - tips that curl . the kinetochore fibril - tips also attach to each other when brought into close contact , a circumstance that is especially likely when the fibrils attach to the mt as neighbours .",
    "when fibril tips attach to each other , loops are formed into which curling protofilaments of a depolymerising mt can hook and thus exert force on the kinetochore .",
    "this movie shows a single protofilament interacting with a bunch of kinetochore fibrils from two different angles .",
    "the incident straight protofilament captures some kinetochore fibril - tips .",
    "when hydrolysed and curling , the protofilament - tip hooks into the loops formed by the fibrils and exerts a force - the loop is visibly pulled out of the mass of the other fibrils , while the fibril bases , as well as the protofilament base , are held static and are not allowed to move .",
    "depolymerisation of the protofilament increases the force exerted on the kinetochore - the fibril loop stretches further - until the interface fractures .",
    "this movie shows the interface of a straight pf with  for simplicity  only one attached kinetochore fibril . after initial thermalization",
    ", the fibril base is moved with constant velocity , resulting in the unwrapping of the fibril during which the pulling force is not transmitted onto the kinetochore - protofilament interface . after",
    "the unwrapping is complete , the fibril is pulled off the pf , after enough force built up to overcome the potential attaching the fibril tip to the pf .",
    "we use the same setup as in movie s3 , with the difference that the bases of the kinetochore fibrils are not held fixed , but each base is attached to every other by linear springs , to emulate the kinetochore body . at first no external force acts on the fibrils and the curling of the protofilament transports the fibril bundle a short distance until external forces are switched .",
    "then the kinetochore fibril bases are pulled with constant velocity which results in the uncurling of the depolymerizing protofilament and eventual detachment .",
    "we use a similar setup as in movie s4 , with the following differences : we reduce the number of fibrils to two and the binding energy between the fibril tips by 50% .",
    "when the kinetochore fibril bases are pulled with constant velocity , the mt starts to uncurl slightly , but then the force on the fibril tips becomes too high and they detach from each other ."
