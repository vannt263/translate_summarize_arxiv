    "most of the recent investigations of inelastic light scattering by free carriers ( electronic raman scattering ) on high-@xmath0 superconductors are focused on the low energy electronic spectra ( up to the gap energy ) obtained for different polarizations of the incident and scattered light .",
    "these experiments are carried out in order to study the angular dependence of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "indeed , theoretical calculations initiated by deveraux et al.@xcitepredicted specific power laws of the electronic raman intensity at low energy depending on the superconducting gap symmetry and the light polarization . more precisely , for a @xmath21 gap ( or a @xmath24 gap since raman scattering is not phase sensitive ) , the @xmath17 and @xmath3 symmetries involved ( deduced respectively from  parallel and crossed polarizations along cu - o direction ) should display a linear frequency dependence whereas the @xmath4 symmetry ( obtained from crossed polarisations at @xmath25 degrees from the cu - o direction ) should exhibit a cubic frequency dependence below the gap energy .    in order to carry out with reasonable confidence such an investigation a number of experimental difficulties",
    "must be overcome .",
    "the main reason for the occurence of these difficulties stems out of the intrinsic weakness of the electronic raman intensity which tends to be easily hindered by other contributions to the spectra .",
    "these originate from i ) phonons scattering , ii ) parasitic phases  ( luminescence or raman ) and iii ) the effect of disorder .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present clean and reliable electronic raman measurements on high@xmath26 superconductors .",
    "this implies to find the appropriate high@xmath26 superconductor which allow us to eliminate the extra scattering contribution mentioned just above .",
    "we briefly discuss below each of these various contributions together with their possible cure .",
    "the first major experimental difficulty is that in most compounds e.g. @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath33 , an intense phonon structure is observed together with the weaker continuum of the electronic excitations.@xcite in order to study the pure electronic raman response function the phonon peaks have to be subtracted from the spectra .",
    "vibrational structures are experimentally defined from the n state spectra and removed from the s state one . without considering other contribution , this procedure can not take into account the phonon temperature dependence ( changes on the lineshape and intensity ) .",
    "the intrinsic weakness of the electronic raman scattering , resulting in a moderate signal to noise ratio , makes this procedure awkward . despite these difficulties ,",
    "qualitative agreement has been found with the @xmath21model @xcite although the exponent for the power law of the @xmath4 channel is often exceedingly dependent on the phonon subtraction protocole .",
    "raw data ( before subtraction of phonons ) frequently exhibit an ambiguous exponent of the power law of the @xmath4 channel .",
    "an attempt to avoid this problem @xcite consisted to work on @xmath34 superconductor , staying out of resonance of the phononic scattering by the use of the red excitation line .",
    "qualitative agreement with the @xmath21model for the stoichiometric compound was obtained from raw data ( without subtraction of phonon ) in @xmath4 channel .    in our previous work ,",
    "in contrast with the above mentioned compounds , we observed that the  @xmath1 compounds exhibit much lower intensity phonon lines ( about one order of magnitude ) for polarization lying into the @xmath35 planes.@xcite .",
    "the decrease of the raman activity of the @xmath4 phonon can be understood by symmetry considerations with respect to the @xmath35 layer .",
    "indeed it has been shown @xcite that the @xmath4 raman phonon activity increases with the crystal electric field induced by the cationic planes above and below the @xmath35 plane . in the @xmath23",
    "mecrcurate the charge equivalence of the two cations ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 )  minimizes the local electric field and thus reduces the raman phonon activity .",
    "conversely in the @xmath38 compound where two differently charged cations ( @xmath39 , @xmath36 ) are present above and below the @xmath35 plane , the raman phonon activity is enhanced .",
    "this favourable situation allowed us to carry out analysis of the raman electronic spectra in the normal and superconducting states without dealing with the delicate handling of  phonon subtraction  .",
    "another advantage to work with mercurates is that these compounds belong to the highest @xmath0 cuprate family which provides a larger spectral range below the superconducting gap frequency where the low - energy electronic spectrum can be analyzed .",
    "the second major difficulty is due to the presence of parasitic phases on the surface of crystal mercurates .",
    "we have measured severals @xmath23 single crystals from various batches corresponding to different oxygen doping .",
    "significant intrinsic variation of the shape of the low energy spectrum ( and thus changes of the power law ) have been observed .",
    "these changes occur not only from batch to batch but , surprisingly , may also depend on the impact point of the laser beam onto the surface of the same crystal . @xcite as will be shown below , electronic microscopy analyses revealed traces of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 which appear on as grown single crystal surfaces after exposure to air ( for a few days ) .",
    "we discovered by a specific study on each of these phases ( in bulk form ) that their electronic background is able to modify significantly the spectra even for minute quantities .",
    "the third difficulty originates from oxygen doping .",
    "all studies carried out on under - doped , optimally doped and over - doped high-@xmath0 superconductors revealed that the low energy electronic spectra is very sensitive to the oxygen doping.@xcite .",
    "in contrast with the stoichiometric @xmath34 compound , optimal doping of the @xmath23 compound is reached for over - stoichiometry of oxygen .",
    "however , excess of oxygen introduces disorder into the @xmath2plane .",
    "the effect of this disorder ( as we will see ) is qualitatively to alter the electronic raman spectrum at low energy , namely introducing a linear - like frequency dependence visible in the @xmath4 channel .",
    "in particular , our previous work@xcite on electronic raman spectra on nearly stoichiometric @xmath23 crystals displayed a frequency dependence of the @xmath4channel in clear contradiction with the @xmath43  symmetry .",
    "as a consequence , in order to avoid the phonon problem , to eliminate traces of parasitic phases and reduce the oxygen disorder coming from @xmath44 over - stoichiometry , we have chosen to study strongly under - doped ( ud ) @xmath45 crystals ( nearly stoichiometric ) , cleaning the surface just before raman measurements .    using these experimental conditions",
    ", we report pure electronic raman spectra in the n and s states of the strongly ud @xmath23 single crystals .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows : in the s state , the @xmath3 electronic spectrum exhibits a linear frequency dependence at low energy up to @xmath19 @xmath46 whereas the @xmath4 one shows a cubic frequency dependence up to @xmath47 @xmath20@xcite .",
    "the raman spectra of the @xmath23 in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels show for the first time a well defined maxima at @xmath13 @xmath48 and @xmath15 @xmath48 respectively .",
    "mixed @xmath5 and @xmath49 symmetries exhibit a strong maximum close to @xmath18 @xmath50 .",
    "below @xmath51 @xmath20 the electronic spectra of the strongly ud @xmath23 for all the channels ( and up to the gap energy for the @xmath4 ) exhibit the electronic scattering expected for a pure @xmath21  gap .",
    "the quality of the experimental data offers a compelling evidence for the @xmath52wave model .",
    "however to reconcile the @xmath4 and @xmath3 peak positions , the @xmath3 raman vertices have to be expanded to the next higher order of fermi surface harmonics @xcite .",
    "the strong maximum in mixed @xmath53 and @xmath6 channels can not be simply explained by coulomb screening .",
    "these two last points raise new questions about significance ( within the @xmath21 framework ) of the electronic maxima detected on the raman spectra and the effective coulomb screening of the @xmath17 channel .",
    "the crystallographic structure of @xmath23 is tetragonal and belongs to the @xmath54 space group @xcite which allows us a direct comparison with theoretical calculations based on tetragonal symmetries . @xmath55",
    "single crystals were grown by a single step synthesis as previously described @xcite resulting in strongly under - doped system with only few stacking defects .",
    "oxygen doping ( when needed ) was achieved by a separate oxygen annealing yielding slightly underdoped system .",
    "they are parallelepipeds with typical 0.7 x 0.7 @xmath56 square cross section and thickness 0.3 mm .",
    "the [ 100 ] crystallographic direction lies at @xmath25 degrees of the edge of the square and the [ 001 ] direction is normal to the surface .",
    "this geometry helps us to align the crystallographic directions with respect to the light polarization @xcite .",
    "dc magnetization measurements on strongly and slightly ud @xmath23 crystals under field cooling ( fc ) and zero field cooling ( zfc ) are displayed in fig.1 .",
    "a sharp transition occurs at @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 , ( @xmath60 @xmath61 for the stongly udmercurate whereas the slightly ud @xmath23 exhibits a larger transitionwidth ( @xmath62 @xmath61 with onset of diamagnetism around @xmath63 @xmath64 and a main transition close to @xmath65 @xmath59 .",
    "this most likely manifests a variation of the oxygen content inside the slightly ud crystals .",
    "we estimate the oxygen doping from the @xmath66 diagram recently established @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath67 for @xmath68 @xmath59 whereas @xmath69 @xmath59 corresponds to @xmath70@xcite . up to now",
    ", the smallest value of @xmath71 experimentally obtained is close to @xmath72.@xcite optimal doping is reached for _  _ @xmath73 .",
    "since over stoichiometry ( @xmath74 ) refers to an excess of oxygen atoms randomly arranged within the @xmath75 planes , optimal doping implies oxygen disorder in the @xmath2 plane . in order to reduce the oxygen disorder inside the @xmath23 structure",
    "it is therefore more appropriate to study ud @xmath23 crystals .",
    "moreover the ud @xmath45 system is closer to a four - fold symmetry than an optimally doped one and is thus more appropriate to symmetry considerations .",
    "resistivity values at @xmath76 is typically @xmath77 @xcite showing the presence of very little ( if any ) impurities or defects .",
    "a  particular attention has been paid on the surface quality as already mentioned above .",
    "the mirror surface of the freshly as - grown single crystal observed with optical microscope reveal @xmath72 @xmath78defect - free domains .",
    "however , after a few days of exposure to atmosphere new phases appear due to local decomposition .",
    "these new phases undetectable by x - ray diffraction measurements , cluster together ( @xmath79 @xmath80 ) and are identified as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath81 by a local electron probe analysis . in order to eliminate these phases we have polished the ud @xmath23 single crystal surface just before raman measurements.@xmath82the single crystal is fixed by beeswax and polished by hand using diamonds paste of @xmath83  and the adequate polishing felt disc . the crystal is then cleaned with aceton for spectroscopy ( containing less than @xmath84 of @xmath85 ) .",
    "we thus regenerate the original high quality defect - free surface of the crystal without local decomposition .",
    "sometimes one or two inclusions of @xmath81 @xmath86 are observed in the bulk and disapear upon further polishing .",
    "scanning tunneling measurements on the polished surface reveals that the polishing streaks are less than @xmath87 deep .",
    "an important optical test is that polished crystal surface under crossed polarization remains dark .",
    "this shows that the mechanical polishing does not alter the polarization of the incident light .",
    "raman measurements were performed with a double monochromator ( u-1000 jobin - yvon ) using a single channel detection ( emi 9863b photomultiplier ) and the @xmath88 laser 514.52 nm line .",
    "the spectral resolution was set at @xmath89 @xmath90 the crystals immediately after polishing were mounted ( in the vacuum ) on the cold finger of a liquid helium flow cryostat .",
    "the temperature was controlled by a clts resistance located on the backside of the cold finger .",
    "the incident laser spot is less than 100 @xmath80 in diameter and the intensity onto the crystal surface was kept below @xmath91 @xmath92 in order to avoid heating of the crystal .",
    "the incidence angle was @xmath93 degrees .",
    "the polarization is denoted in the usual way : x [ 100 ] ( a axis ) , y [ 010 ] , x[110 ] , y[1@xmath940 ] . in order to compare our experimental data with the theoretical calculations,@xcite",
    "the pure @xmath3 ( xy ) and @xmath4 ( xy ) symmetries are needed .",
    "this requires that the incident electric field have to lie within the xy plane .",
    "the incoming light being not normal to the surface , the crystal mount has to be rotated by @xmath25 degrees  between the @xmath12 and @xmath3 spectra .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath5 symmetries are obtained from the ( xx ) and ( xx ) polarizations respectively . in order to probe the same area for all symmetries ,",
    "the impact of the laser beam onto the crystal surface was precisely located before turning the crystal .",
    "only large homogenous surfaces have been selected .",
    "the least diffusive spot was selected in order to  minimize the amount of spurious elastic scattering .",
    "each raman spectrum has been obtained after a sum of 40 scans .",
    "each scan has spanned between @xmath91 and @xmath95 @xmath20 with an increment of @xmath89 @xmath20 and an integration time of @xmath96 @xmath97 .",
    "in view of the presence of the extra phases , we have performed systematic investigations of the hitherto non reported raman spectra of the parasitic phases related to mercury compounds , i.e : @xmath41 , @xmath40 , @xmath98 , @xmath42 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "measurements were carried out in the bulk form ( powder ) in the full range of interest ( up to @xmath95 @xmath46 ) and in the same experimental conditions as the one of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 spectra in the superconducting state ( excitation line : 514.52 nm , light under crossed polarization , t@xmath101",
    "@xmath59 ) . the results will be presented separetly@xcite but can be summarized as follows :  all these phases exhibit a nearly flat background together with caracteristic phonon peaks @xcite except the @xmath41 phase which shows a linear frequency dependent background extending up to @xmath95 @xmath20 .",
    "this last phase can significantly alter the analysis of raman spectra as will be shown .",
    "imaginary part of the raman response function in the s state and the n state of the strongly ud @xmath23 compound for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath53 and @xmath6 channels are displayed  in fig.2 .",
    "the imaginary part of the susceptibilities in the superconducting and the normal states are obtained from raman measurements at @xmath102 @xmath59 and @xmath103 @xmath59 respectively .",
    "we present in fig.2 the most representative spectra of a serial of three sets of measurements perfomed on a strongly ud @xmath23 crystal . in the following order ,",
    "we have subtracted the dark current of the photomultiplier @xcite , the rayleigh scattering when present , @xcite corrected the spectra for the response of the spectrometer and the detectorand divided the spectra by the bose - einstein factor @xmath104^{-1}$ ] . for the @xmath4 and @xmath3 channels obtained from crossed polarizations the response",
    "was scaled up by a factor 1.2 with respect to the @xmath17 mixed channels in order to take into account the absorption of the half wavelength plate inserted between the analyzer and the entrance slit of the spectrometer .",
    "the insertion of the half wavelength plate allows us to restore the same polarization inside the spectrometer for all the channels and thus benefit from the best configuration with respect to the grating factor efficiency .    in the s state , we clearly observe a linear frequency dependence at low energy ( exponent @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath105 from fig.2 ) with a well defined electronic maximum near @xmath106 @xmath20 for the @xmath3 channel whereas the @xmath4 channel exibit no measurable electronic scattering below @xmath107 @xmath46 in the limit of the photomultiplier detection and a non linear frequency dependence ( exponent @xmath10 @xmath8 @xmath72 from fig.2 ) until we reach a maximum around @xmath108 @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we observe in fig.2 , for both @xmath4 and @xmath3 channels , that the intensity of the electronic continuum above @xmath108 @xmath20 in the n state is two times smaller than for the s state .",
    "temperature dependence of the optical absorption @xmath109 ( @xmath110 @xmath111 between @xmath112 @xmath59and @xmath113 @xmath59 can not explain such a large difference since the infra - red reflectance spectra is temperature independent above @xmath95 @xmath20@xcite .    in the @xmath17",
    "mixed symmetries , the electronic continuum shows a linear increase with respect to @xmath114 with a maximun centered around @xmath115 @xmath46 .",
    "the slope of the electronic scattering is twice larger in the @xmath53 spectrum than in the @xmath6 one .",
    "this can be attributed to the @xmath3  linear contribution which increases the slope at low energy and broadens the low energy side of the @xmath5 maximum . as a consequence",
    "the @xmath6 peak is narrower than the @xmath116 one .",
    "a special remark can be made concerning the variation of the intensity of the phonon peaks at @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xmath20 in the s state in comparison with the n state .",
    "the intensities of these two phonon peaks are reduced by a factor of 3 when temperature raises from @xmath102 @xmath59 to @xmath119 @xmath59 and decrease again by a factor of 1.2 between @xmath119 @xmath59 and @xmath120 @xmath121 the strong increase of the phonon intensity is clearly a superconductivity related effect since the phonon exhibit two regimes of intensity variations above and below @xmath0 .",
    "the raman phonon activities become similar to those obtained when electric fields are perpendicular to the xy plane i.e. in zz polarization .",
    "the intensity enhancement of the phonons in the superconducting state has also been observed in other cuprates and a modified raman scattering mechanism induced by a redistribution of the excitated states in the superconducting state has been proposed.@xcite",
    "in our previous work on slightly ud @xmath23 mercurates , contrary to the present work on strongly ud @xmath23 , we reported a linear frequency dependence at low energy for the @xmath4 spectrum ( as well as for the @xmath122 ) and one extra shoulder near @xmath108 @xmath20  for  the @xmath17 spectrum beside the @xmath115 @xmath20 peak .",
    "@xcite  these observations , in contradiction with the @xmath21 model , have been interpreted as the signature of an order parameter of lower symmetry . in view of the specific study on the parasitic phases mentioned above , we can now assign the presence of this shoulder to the presence of the @xmath40 phase .",
    "this is also supported by the observation on the @xmath17 spectrum of the intense @xmath123 @xmath20phonon peak which is another signature of the @xmath40 phase . in the same way",
    ", we suspect that the multicomponents features observed by zhou et al .",
    "@xcite on the raman spectra of @xmath23 single crystals originate from vibrational modes of @xmath42 and @xmath40 traces present on the crystal surface .",
    "indeed the @xmath124 @xmath20 and @xmath123 @xmath125 peaks are characterisitc of @xmath42 and @xmath40 spectra and correspond to the oxygen motions of the @xmath42 and @xmath40 phases . concerning",
    "the linear background previously reported @xcite two explanations can be proposed a priori : i ) scattering related to parasitic phases on the crystal surface , ii )  scattering induced by oxygen doping . among different phases we quoted above ,",
    "only the @xmath41 phase which provides frequency linear background and is able to compete even with minute quantities , with the superconducting  signal @xcite .",
    "quantitative estimate @xcite show that less than @xmath126 of @xmath41 is sufficient to produce scattering of the order of magnitude of the electronic raman coming from the s state .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to thoroughtly eliminate these phases before any optical investigation .",
    "however an additionnal @xmath41 background which extends beyond to @xmath95 @xmath20 makes it difficult to interpret the decrease of the continuum above @xmath108 @xmath20observed on slightly ud mercurates .",
    "moreover we observed that the temperature dependence of the electronic raman changed at @xmath0 transition@xcite.for these reasons we mainly attribute the linear frequency dependence at low energy in @xmath4 channel to the intrinsic effect of oxygen over - stoichiometry rather than only to the extrinsic @xmath41 phase .",
    "many raman experiments have been performed on high@xmath26 superconductors as a function of oxygen doping which reveal changes in the low energy electronic continuum .",
    "@xcite optimaly doped ( stoichiometric ) @xmath34 compounds exhibit a cubic like dependence at low energy whereas the overdoped ( over - stoichiometric ) @xmath127 compounds show a linear dependence at low energy.@xcite impurity scattering was proposed to explain such a behaviour@xcite . in our previous data of slightly ud @xmath23",
    "crystal the linear background extends up to @xmath128 @xmath20 which means a scattering impurity rate @xmath129 of the order of the gap @xmath130 itself .",
    "such a high scattering rate should strongly reduce the critical temperature .",
    "this is in contradiction with @xmath69 @xmath59 and resisitivity value ( @xmath131 .",
    "we propose that the linear background is the ( direct or indirect ) effect of localized states generated by oxygen disorder in the @xmath2plane .",
    "as mentioned in section ii , the oxygen disorder is expected to be more important in nearly optimally doped or slightly ud system than the strongly ud one .",
    "this is supported by infra - red reflectance measurements @xcite .",
    "indeed a strong scattering rate at low energy ( @xmath132 @xmath59 ) is observed in nearly optimally doped system as well as an intense peak ( near @xmath133 @xmath134 on the real part of the optical conductivity .",
    "this peak is often seen in high-@xmath0 superconductors in presence of oxygen disorder@xcite .",
    "conversely , in strongly ud system there is no residual scattering at low frequency ( @xmath132 @xmath59 ) and the @xmath133 @xmath20peak is narrower and weaker .",
    "we compare our experimental data with the @xmath21 model . in the limit where the superconducting correlation length is much smaller than the optical penetration depth",
    ", the imaginary part of the response function for @xmath135  including the screening due to coulomb interaction is  given by : @xcite @xmath136 \\text { \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( 1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath137 is defined by : @xmath138 here @xmath139 and @xmath140 are general raman vertices already described @xcite .",
    "@xmath141 is the density of states for both spin orientations at the fermi level , and the brackets indicate an average over the fermi surface .",
    "@xmath142 stands for the superconducting , @xmath143-dependent gap .",
    "eq.(2 ) vanishes in the limit of large frequency where we should recover the electronic scattering of the normal state .",
    "therefore the normal state scattering contribution is not taken into account in the raman response function derived in this work .     in the @xmath21 model ,",
    "as computed by devereaux et al.@xcite , we approximate the fermi surface as being a cylinder and take : @xmath144 @xmath145 for the gap and for the vertices:@xmath146    @xmath147 @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath150  ( 3 )    in @xmath4 and @xmath3 symmetries , @xmath151 vanishes which implies that the last term in eq.(1 ) drops out . in other words , the @xmath4 and @xmath3 symmetry are not screened .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath17 symmetry , and screening has to be properly taken into account .",
    "nevertheless one sees easily from this equation that any * k*-independent contribution to the raman vertex drops out of the result .    in a pure @xmath21 model ,",
    "the @xmath4 channel is  not sensitive to the nodes because the raman vertex @xmath152 is zero by symmetry for @xmath153 in contrast , the @xmath154 and @xmath155 regions do contribute , giving weight to the gap @xmath130 in these directions . as a consequence the @xmath4 spectrum displays a weak scattering at low energy and @xmath82the calculated spectrum shows a @xmath156 frequency dependence with a maximum at @xmath157 .",
    "conversely , in the @xmath3 channel , the raman vertex @xmath152 is zero by symmetry for @xmath154 or @xmath155 or and non zero elsewhere , hence provides weight in the @xmath153 directions where the nodes are present .",
    "the @xmath3 spectrum exhibits a linear low frequency dependence and a smeared gap .",
    "finally the @xmath17 channel is sensitive to both nodes and gap because the raman vertex @xmath152 does nt vanish @xmath82 in the @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 regions .",
    "the @xmath17 channel have to show a linear low @xmath114 behaviour .",
    "this remains available when we take into account the screening .     to provide a more realistic account of experimental results with respect to the theory we have included life - time effects",
    "we have chosen to include electronic damping by convoluting the bare  spectra with a lorentzian function .",
    "depending on the electronic correlation model , the reduced half width of the lorentzian can be taken as a constant ( @xmath158 , proportional to @xmath114 @xmath159  or proportional to @xmath160 ( @xmath161)@xmath162 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 experimental spectrum exhibits a nearly cubic frequency dependence up to @xmath163 @xmath20 .",
    "such a behaviour imposes , whatever the type of damping , to use small values for the @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 parameters . for @xmath164 @xmath167",
    "we obtain satisfactory fits for the @xmath4 spectrum , conversely if we increase by a factor 2 the reduced parameters , fits are in disagrement with experiments .",
    "as already explained @xcite we have chosen to display fits for @xmath168 @xmath169 the calculated curves of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 spectra for three values of the @xmath165 parameter are shown in fig .",
    "3 . the half width at half maximum of the @xmath4 peak is seen to double as the @xmath165 parameter is increased by a factor @xmath170 .",
    "this dependence reduces the choice of the @xmath165 parameter to values close to @xmath171 in order to be in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "this value of  the damping parameter @xmath165 should be compared with the value of @xmath172 previously obtained on more oxygen disordered @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the fact that in this latter case @xmath0 is increased may appear paradoxical .",
    "we are forced to conclude , in that case , that the effect of doping overwhelms  the effect of scattering by disorder .",
    "a similar conclusion can be reached from infrared - measurements @xcite .",
    "the theoretical spectra in @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath17 screened channels for @xmath173 are displayed in fig .",
    "fits have been calculated from the strongly ud @xmath23 data .",
    "the 2@xmath130 gap has been defined from the @xmath4 spectrum since the @xmath4 vertex probes directly the @xmath174 amplitude .",
    "we have chosen to adjust the lower part of the calculated curves to the experimental data .",
    "below @xmath51 @xmath20 we find a very good agreement between theoretical and experimental data for all the three channels and up to the gap for the @xmath4 channel . however the fits are not satisfactory at higher energy ( above @xmath51 @xmath20 ) for the @xmath175 and @xmath17 channels .",
    "firstly the @xmath3 maximum of the calculated spectrum ( @xmath163 @xmath20 ) is clearly far away from the @xmath3 experimental one ( @xmath106 @xmath20 ) as it is seen in fig .",
    "4 . as a consequence",
    "the calculated frequency ratio between the @xmath4 and @xmath3 peaks positions ( 1.2 ) do not correspond to the experimental one ( 1.6 ) obtained from the @xmath23 spectra .",
    "secondly the calculated curve of the @xmath17 screened spectrum is a broad peak centered around @xmath163 @xmath20 whereas we get experimentally a sharper ( width at half maximum : @xmath107 @xmath20 ) and more intense peak near @xmath115 @xmath20 .    concerning the first point ( @xmath3 spectrum ) we propose to expand the @xmath122 vertex to higher order as was already done for the @xmath17 vertex .",
    "the justification of this procedure is based on the fact that the fermi surface is anisotropic .",
    "the @xmath3 vertex is expected to be more sensitive to additionnal harmonic terms than the @xmath4 vertex because the @xmath3 vertex probes a region where the gap changes drastically ( nodes of the gap ) .",
    "it is then possible to reconcile experiments to the @xmath21 model by expanding the @xmath3 vertex to the next order of the fermi surface harmonics.@xcite indeed including higher order fermi surface harmonics in the raman vertices change the relative positions of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 peaks .",
    "cardona et al.@xcite showed that the @xmath4 peak shifts down when varying the @xmath176 parameter related to the contribution of the second fermi surface harmonics : @xmath177 . by taking @xmath178 @xmath179we",
    "find that the @xmath122  peak softens as @xmath180 increases ( see fig .",
    "as expected this softening is even larger when we consider the @xmath3 vertex than for the @xmath12 vertex .",
    "the calculated curve of the @xmath3 spectrum obtained for @xmath181 is displayed on fig.4 .",
    "we find an agreement between our calculated and experimental curves up to @xmath163 @xmath20 .",
    "these results are consistent with the @xmath21 model under considering the deviation away from the cylindricity of the fermi surface when calculating the vertices .",
    "the deviation of the raman vertex is assumed larger than the one of the wave - vector on the fermi surface .",
    "best fits could be further improved by taking the electronic scattering of the normal state but this is not done here .    concerning the second point ( @xmath17 spectrum )",
    "the coulomb screening present in the raman scattering process is might be not as efficient as it has been considered .",
    "strong mass fluctuations induced by inter - layer coupling or several sheets of @xmath35 planes as proposed elsewhere,@xcite could decrease the @xmath17 scattering efficiency . on the other hand expansion to higher order of the @xmath17 vertex have to be explored .",
    "in conclusion we have specially investigated strongly under - doped @xmath55 single crystals in order to reduce the oxygen disorder in the @xmath183 taking care to eliminate parasitic phases on the crystal surface . in these improved experimental conditions we are able to report with good accuracy the pure electronic raman scattering ( without subtraction of phonons ) in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 channels .",
    "the @xmath184 model fits quite well with the low energy part ( below @xmath19  @xmath20 ) of the spectra for the @xmath3 and @xmath17 symmetries and up to the gap energy for the @xmath185 one .",
    "however , in order to reconciliate with the @xmath186 model , the upper part of the @xmath4 and @xmath3spectra ( above @xmath19 @xmath20 ) , we have to expand the @xmath3 vertex to the next order of fermi surface harmonics .",
    "the sharp and intense electronic maximum in mixed @xmath17 symmetries is not easy to interpret in the framework of the @xmath184 model .",
    "this last point raises new questions on the @xmath17 screening efficiency .",
    "experimentally , this work on near stoichiometric @xmath23 compounds as compared to previous work on less stoichiometric compounds highlights the importance of oxygen disorder on the low energy excitations as revealed by the frequency dependence , cubic or linear of the electronic raman spectra .",
    "this surprisingly strong effect already reported in a number of high@xmath26 cuprates is understood in only a qualitative way and bears directly on the dynamic of the low lying electronic states in the superconducting state .",
