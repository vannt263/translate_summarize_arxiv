    "the size of the source created in @xmath1 and @xmath0 collisions , as measured with momentum correlations , increases with the particle multiplicity ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the correlation of the extracted size with the rapidity density of the collisions , from the hbt analysis , was sometimes described as evidence for the existence of a `` source '' with a given size .",
    "some alternative explanations have been given invoking long lived resonances and multiple parton interactions @xcite .",
    "in the present work we are investigating whether the observed behavior may be understood in terms of more trivial explanations related to the details of the hadronization of the partons leading to jets .",
    "we know namely , that the point of hadronization of a jet and the point of the initial parton  parton hard scattering do not coincide .",
    "the distance between them is the so called hadronization length ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "numerical estimates for the time scale of hadronization vary significantly @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , but owing to the lorentz boost to the laboratory frame , they are proportional to the energy , @xmath3 ( @xcite ) . hence , there is a dependence of @xmath2 on the energy due to the lorentz boost . on the other hand",
    "the energy spectrum of the emitted jets depends on the charged particle multiplicity of the events as shown in fig.[cap : meanetvsnch ] .",
    "hence if we assume that the hadronization occurs at different distances from the initial hard scatterings , depending on the energy of the jet , we can expect that this effect may simulate an extended hadronic source without invoking the presence of a thermalized source of hadrons .",
    "we have followed this line of thought in the present work .",
    "the simulation comprises three steps :    1 .   the simulation of the particle momenta using a standard pythia event generator .",
    "identification of jets and `` underlying event '' .",
    "2 .   creation of a spatial distribution of particle origins according to our perception of the hadronization process .",
    "3 .   implementation of the bose - einstein effect and creation of the correlation functions .      with pythia 6.24 @xcite we simulate pp collisions with @xmath4  tev .",
    "the pycell subroutine , that is part of the generator , is used to identify jets .",
    "we applied the following parameters :    * pseudo - rapidity range ( @xmath5 ) : from -2 to 2 * number of pseudo - rapidity bins : 1200 * number of bins in azimuthal angle : 1200 * threshold transverse energy of particles considered : 0 * minimum transverse energy of particles that are used as jet seeds : @xmath6 gev * minimum jet transverse energy : @xmath7 gev * maximum jet radius @xmath8 : 1    all particles that do not belong to any jet are treated as an `` underlying event '' .",
    "jet axis @xmath9 - the direction along which the jet develops - is defined as @xmath10 the sums run over all particles that make up a jet .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are transverse momentum , azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity of the ith particle , respectively .      the events simulated with pythia are then treated according to our model .",
    "namely , the particles identified above as `` underlying events '' are given a spatial origin centered around the initial hard scattering point , while particles within a jet are given spatial coordinates of origin according to one of the models described below .",
    "[ [ tube ] ] tube + + + +    it is assumed that the hadronization length ( @xmath14 , the distance from the hard scattering ) depends linearly on the initial parton energy that we approximate by @xmath15 ( jet total transverse momentum ) .",
    "thus , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a multiplicative factor that represents our lack of theoretical insight into the process of hadronization . for every parton",
    "the loci of hadronization along the jet axis ( @xmath18 ) is randomized from gaussian distributions with a mean equal to @xmath14 and a @xmath19 , preventing negative values . in the transverse direction ( with respect to the jet axis )",
    "the hadronization points are randomized so that the distance to the jet axis follows a gaussian distribution with a variance equal to @xmath20 and mean value of zero .",

    "[ [ section ] ]    for both kinds of geometries the hadronization time is equal to @xmath18 .",
    "the positions of the `` underlying event '' particles are randomized from a single gaussian distribution with variance @xmath29 .",
    "their emission time is always equal to 0 .      since the generator does not provide for bose - einstein correlations they have to be introduced . in our simulation",
    "we introduce them using the weighting algorithm due to lednick @xcite .",
    "it is applied during the construction of the correlation functions .",
    "each particle pair @xmath30 is weighted with a probability @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of pairs in a given bin , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the 4-vectors of the hadronization points and momentum in the pair rest frame , respectively .",

    "the application of the model described above , in agreement with the intuition , shows that the correlation function indeed changes its shape with increasing multiplicity . using the experimental data we have attempted to adjust the parameters of the model .",
    "we have fixed @xmath54 fm what corresponds to the typical hadronic size .",
    "we found that @xmath55 fm reproduces the experimental results at the lowest multiplicities ( e735 has measured @xmath56 fm at @xmath57 ) . in the frame of our model",
    "it implies a non - negligible contribution of hard processes in total particle production even at low multiplicities .",
    "this observation is in an agreement with other observations at tevatron @xcite .",
    "however , we were not able to reach compatibility with the experimental values of @xmath58 at high multiplicities .",
    "the increase of the @xmath17 parameter causes a decrease of the intercept parameter , while the shape of the correlation function stays approximately unchanged .",
    "in fact , the width of the peak , thus @xmath59 as given by a gaussian fit even decreases with increasing @xmath17 .    using the _ out - side - long _ ( osl ) parametrization",
    "we have observed that for this model @xmath60 grows with @xmath17 , while @xmath61 stays approximately unchanged .",
    "this finding matches the intuitive representation .",
    "therefore the applied geometry with a constant @xmath20 limits the growth of @xmath58 .",
    "we deduce that @xmath61 must also increase with the jet energy .",
    "this led us to the `` dynamic width '' jet geometry .    , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . ]    using that model , we have found that we are able to reproduce the experimental results with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , see fig.[result]a and [ 16m3 ] .",
    "this is not a unique pair of parameters that gives a good agreement with e735 result . within some range we can decrease @xmath17 and find such a value of @xmath66 such that we still reproduce the experimental result ( fig.[result]b ) .",
    "we believe that the precision on the determination of f values could be improved if results of a 3d hbt analysis were available .",
    "namely , the dependence of @xmath60 and @xmath61 on event multiplicity is required .",
    "we have found that @xmath61 increases together with @xmath66 , and @xmath60 together with @xmath17 ( see table.[tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "it means that we can estimate the size of the jet fragmentation volume using the three dimensional correlation analysis .",
    ".dependence of @xmath67 radii on @xmath68 and @xmath68 for the @xmath69 .",
    "the fits were made imposing a double gaussian ( eq . [ eq : dblgaus ] ) on 1d projections , taking two other components @xmath70 mev . in the rows where @xmath71 is not specified fits did not converge and a single gaussian is used instead . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "using a simple approach which introduces a dependence of the distance of the mean hadronization points of a parton on its energy we have been able to reproduce very satisfactorily both the dependence of the radii , and the trend of the correlation strength lambda with the rapidity density in pp collisions .",
    "the present results indicate that there is a possibility of an alternative interpretation of the results to those presented in @xcite and @xcite where the obtained radii are interpreted as evidence for the observation of deconfined matter in pp collisions ,    on the other hand the model a posteriori justifies the hadronization scenario envisaged because the free parameter @xmath72 has been found close to unity for the range of multiplicities analyzed .",
    "we believe that the lhc with its wider range of multiplicities in pp collisions offers interesting possibilities to test our model .",
    "we have therefore presented here the expected variation of the radii in function of charged particle multiplicities at the lhc .",
    "similarly , the effect of the parton hadronization should be taken into account in the analysis of hbt radii in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the very useful discussions with u. wiedemann and j. pluta ."
