    "the relation between quantum spectra , on the one hand , and the dynamics of the corresponding classical systems , on the other , is a problem of fundamental importance in physics , which has attracted attention ever since the early days of quantum mechanics .",
    "a key to understanding this relation in chaotic systems was gutzwiller s discovery ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that the semiclassical density of states in these systems can be written as a sum over all ( isolated ) periodic orbits of the classical system .",
    "however , practical applications of gutzwiller s trace formula , like other periodic orbit sums , are greatly impeded by the fact that the sums usually diverge in the domain where the physical eigenvalues are located , mainly as a consequence of the rapid proliferation of periodic orbits with growing period .",
    "various techniques were developed over the years to overcome the convergence problem of the periodic orbit sums @xcite , but most of them depend on special properties of the systems , such as ergodicity or the existence of complete symbolic dynamics .    as an alternative",
    ", the technique of harmonic inversion of semiclassical trace formulae has been introduced as a very general method for extracting eigenvalues from periodic orbit sums for both chaotic and regular systems @xcite .",
    "harmonic inversion circumvents the convergence problems , and allows one to obtain the semiclassical eigenvalues from a relatively small number of periodic orbits .",
    "moreover , the method does not require any special properties of the systems , and therefore is applicable also to the particularly challenging case of systems with strong pruning , i.e. , systems with a highly incomplete symbolic coding of the periodic orbits . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the power of the harmonic inversion technique in the semiclassical quantization of the closed three - disk billiard system , for which all other semiclassical quantization methods to date have failed in determining more than the few lowest eigenvalues , chiefly because of the extremely rapid proliferation of periodic orbits with increasing action and the strong pruning typical of this system . from a technical point of view",
    "our study will show that harmonic inversion is numerically stable even when handling huge ( on the order of several million ) periodic orbit sets .",
    "the three - disk billiard system consists of three equally spaced hard disks of unit radius .",
    "the existence or nonexistence of periodic orbits and the behavior of the periodic orbit parameters in the three - disk system sensitively depend on the distance @xmath0 between the centers of the disks .",
    "large disk separations , especially @xmath1 , have served as a test case for periodic orbit quantization of chaotic systems in many investigations in recent years . in particular , the system has been employed as prototype example for the usefulness of periodic orbit quantization by cycle expansion techniques @xcite . for large disk separations , the assumptions of the cycle expansion , namely that the contributions from long orbits are shadowed by those of short orbits , are almost exactly fulfilled .",
    "this is no longer true for small disk separations .",
    "as the disks approach each other , the convergence of the cycle expansion becomes slower and slower , until it finally breaks down .",
    "periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion does not depend on specific properties , such as shadowing of orbits etc .",
    ", and therefore is expected to work well also for small disk separations .",
    "in fact , the harmonic inversion technique has successfully been applied to the `` standard '' literature disk separation @xmath1 as well as to the small distance @xmath2 , where the convergence of the cycle expansion is already slow @xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the limiting case of mutually touching disks , @xmath3 , where the system turns into a bound system , and the requirements of the cycle expansion and other semiclassical methods are no longer fulfilled at all .    for the closed three - disk system ,",
    "the lowest exact quantum eigenvalues were first calculated by tanner et al .",
    "@xcite and by scherer @xcite .",
    "a remarkable step towards the semiclassical quantization of the closed three - disk system was achieved by combining the conventional cycle expansion with a functional equation @xcite .",
    "based on periodic orbit corrections to the mean density of states , approximations to the very lowest eigenvalues could be obtained from a small set of periodic orbits up to cycle length @xmath4 , where the symbolic dynamics is still complete ( including formally a zero length orbit ) . for the very lowest eigenvalues ,",
    "the results were found to be in good agreement with the exact quantum values . however , the method failed for higher eigenvalues , where only the mean density of states could be reproduced . since the problems with the method arose from the strong pruning of orbits in this system , they are of a fundamental nature , and",
    "could not be overcome by including more orbits .",
    "no other semiclassical method has been successful in obtaining higher eigenvalues in the closed three - disk billiard system yet . in this paper",
    ", we will demonstrate that harmonic inversion passes even this acid test of semiclassical quantization .    in sec .",

    "[ hi ] to the harmonic inversion technique for the extraction of the semiclassical eigenvalues .",

    "furthermore , the pruning of orbits and the distribution of the orbit parameters are investigated , and the resulting strategies for the numerical search for periodic orbits are discussed .",
    "the periodic orbits of the three - disk system can be labeled by a ternary symbolic code , which is complete for sufficiently large disk separations .",
    "the classical dynamics of the three - disk system has been studied , among others , by gaspard and rice @xcite . if the disks are labeled by the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , each periodic orbit is characterized by a sequence of these numbers , indicating the disks the particle collides with during one period of the orbit . for sufficiently separated disks",
    ", there is a one - to - one correspondence between the symbolic code and the periodic orbits of the system : for every sequence there exists one unique periodic orbit ( with the restriction that consecutive repetitions of the same symbol are forbidden and circular shifts of a sequence describe the same orbit ) . as was first pointed out by hansen @xcite , at disk separation @xmath5",
    "`` pruning '' sets in , i.e. , part of the periodic orbits become unphysical as they begin to run through one of the disks , and thus the symbolic code is no longer complete .",
    "the number of pruned orbits rapidly becomes larger and larger if the disks continue to approach each other . in the limiting case of touching disks , @xmath3 ,",
    "the system exhibits strong pruning .",
    "examples of pruned orbits will be discussed in section [ numsearch ] .    in our calculations , we make use of the symmetry reduction introduced by cvitanovi and eckhardt in ref .",

    "the quantum states are grouped in the three irreducible subspaces @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , where the states of the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) subspace are symmetric ( antisymmetric ) under reflection at the symmetry lines , respectively , and the states of the @xmath11 subspace are invariant under rotations by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    following refs .",

    "the symmetry reduced periodic orbits are labeled by a binary code , where the symbol ` 0 ' represents backscattering ( or change between clockwise and anti - clockwise scattering ) and the symbol ` 1 ' stands for scattering to the third disk in the original full domain picture . for example , the shortest full domain orbit 12 maps onto the 0 orbit , and the 123 orbit maps onto the 1 orbit .",
    "the quantum resonances of the three different subspaces @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be obtained separately from the periodic orbits in the fundamental domain by introducing appropriate weight factors for the orbits in gutzwiller s trace formula , as was shown by cvitanovi and eckhardt @xcite .",

    "only the primitive periodic orbits have to be determined .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath24 repetition of the primitive orbit ( here characterized by the index 0 ) are then given by @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "for extracting the quantum resonances of the system from eq .",
    "( [ gw3disk ] ) by harmonic inversion , all periodic orbits up to a maximum scaled action have to be included .",
    "the parameters of the periodic orbits  scaled action and stability eigenvalues  have to be determined numerically .",
    "we calculate the primitive periodic orbits using the symbolic code as input . for simplicity ,",
    "the calculations are carried out in the full domain , and the results are then translated back into the symmetry reduced system .",
    "the disks are `` connected '' according to the code , starting with arbitrary reflection points on the disks as initial condition .",
    "the reflection points are then varied in such a way that the total length ( i.e. , the action ) of the orbit reaches a minimum .",
    "all orbit parameters can then be calculated from the reflection points .",
    "the scaled action is given by the length of the ( symmetry reduced ) orbit , and the stability eigenvalue @xmath28 can be determined by an algorithm proposed by bogomolny @xcite .",
    "in addition to action and stability , one can also determine averages of different classical quantities ( distance from the center of the system , angular momentum , etc . ) , which are needed for the cross - correlation technique ( see section [ hi ] ) .    for disk separations smaller than the pruning limit @xmath5",
    ", it has to be checked whether or not the orbits are physical , i.e. , whether or not they stay completely outside the disks . in our numerical calculations , we found two different classes of pruned orbits .",
    "an example of the first class is given in figure [ fig2 ] : as the disks approach each other , a section of the orbit connecting two of the disks gets inside the third disk .",
    "the pruned orbit still corresponds to a unique minimum of the total length when the reflection points on the disks are varied for given symbolic code .",
    "this is not the case for the second class , an example of which is shown in figure [ fig3 ] : in this case , as the disks come closer , the reflection angle at one specific reflection point approaches @xmath29 . as the value @xmath29",
    "is reached , the minimum of the action with respect to this specific reflection point splits into two equal minima and one local maximum .",
    "accordingly , the orbit splits into three unphysical orbits with the same symbolic code .    in one case , the orbit is now reflected on the inside of the disk ( see fig .  [",
    "fig3]c ) , which corresponds to a reflection angle larger than @xmath29 ( i.e. , the orbit has penetrated into the disk in the vicinity of the reflection point ) .",
    "this orbit does not correspond to a minimum of the total length but to a saddle point . in the other two cases , figs .",
    "[ fig3]d and [ fig3]e , the reflection point moves along the disk in such a way that the reflection law is no longer fulfilled but the orbit just passes the `` reflection point '' in a straight line and penetrates into the disk .",
    "these two cases correspond to two equally deep minima of the total length .",
    "the two orbits have the same shape but only differ as to which penetration point is considered as `` reflection point '' , indicated by the squares in figs .",
    "[ fig3]d and [ fig3]e .",
    "in fact , the shape of the orbit is equal to that of a pruned orbit with a ( symmetry reduced ) symbol length that is shorter by 1 and which belongs to the first class of pruned orbits as defined above .",
    "( in this orbit the reflection point in question is simply missing , i.e. , none of the penetration points is considered as reflection point . )    besides the existence or nonexistence of periodic orbits , the distance between the disks also strongly influences the distribution of the periodic orbit parameters .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig4 ] , which compares the orbit parameters of the shortest primitive periodic orbits found for the open three - disk system with disk separation @xmath1 and for the case of touching disks , @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath1 , the action and stability of the orbits are mainly determined by the symbol length , the orbit parameters are nicely bunched in easily distinguishable intervals , and the number of orbits up to a given action is relatively small . however , the picture changes completely when the disks approach each other : as all orbits become shorter , the total number of orbits up to a given action increases rapidly .",
    "the parameters of the orbits are no longer simply determined by the symbol length , and their overall behavior becomes much more complicated , as is evident from figure [ fig4 ] .    for @xmath3 , the orbits can be grouped in `` channels '' with the same `` tail '' ( end figures ) but growing number of leading  0 s in the code .",
    "( a sequence of @xmath30 leading  0 s in the code will be denoted by @xmath31 in the following ) .",
    "these orbits have the same basic shape but run deeper and deeper into the corner formed by two touching disks , bouncing back and forth between the two disks ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .    in each channel",
    ", the action of the orbits grows very slowly with increasing symbol length , while the expanding stability eigenvalue increases relatively fast ( in fact exponentially ) with every additional collision . since adding a leading ` 0 ' to the symbolic code",
    "does not change the action considerably , there is a huge number of orbits with very long symbol lengths but relatively small , and comparable , actions .",
    "in fact , most channels break off because of pruning . e.g. , the @xmath32 series , labeled ( a ) in fig .  [ fig4]b , breaks off after six orbits , and the @xmath33 series , marked ( b ) , already breaks off after three orbits .",
    "our analysis strongly suggests that there exist only two infinite channels : the @xmath34 and the @xmath35 series , dubbed ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ( these channels are only shown up to 20 leading  0 s in the code ) .",
    "the shapes and actions of these orbits converge very slowly towards the shape and action of the limiting orbit which starts exactly in the touching point of two disks and is directly reflected back by the opposite disk ( cf .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . although all other channels break off because of pruning , the number of orbits in a channel up to a given action often becomes very large ( or , in the two cases mentioned , even infinite ) .",
    "note that the 0 orbit , bouncing back and forth between two disks , does not exist in the closed three - disk system .",
    "while for large disk separations finding all orbits up to a given action simply corresponds to calculating all orbits up to a certain maximum symbol length , the complicated distribution of periodic orbit parameters in the closed three - disk system renders the search for the relevant periodic orbits up to a given action a nontrivial task . due to the extremely rapid proliferation of periodic orbits with increasing length @xmath14 , we were not able to determine all orbits up to a given length @xmath36 , but we had to introduce restrictions for the orbits to be included . as the amplitude in the gutzwiller formula depends on the inverse of the stability parameter ,",
    "a reasonable cut - off criterion is the size of the stability of the orbit . on the other hand , since in each channel the absolute value of the expanding stability eigenvalue grows exponentially fast , the main contributions of each channel to the periodic orbit sum come from the orbits with small symbol lengths .",
    "furthermore , the maslov indices of adjacent orbits in each channel differ by two , and therefore the periodic orbit amplitudes alternate in sign , which leads to approximate cancellations of terms in the semiclassical trace formula . as a second criterion",
    ", we therefore restricted the number of consecutive symbols ` 0 ' in the symbolic code , thus selecting the most relevant orbits of each channel .",
    "the orbits were calculated channel by channel , starting from the shortest orbit in the channel and adding more and more leading zeros to the code .",
    "the calculation of the channel was broken off if one of the following conditions was fulfilled :    * the action exceeds the maximum action @xmath36 .",
    "* the absolute value of the stability eigenvalue exceeds the given value @xmath37 . * the maximum number of consecutive symbols ` 0 ' is reached . *",
    "the orbits become pruned .    for the set of periodic orbits shown in figure [ fig4]b , we searched for orbits with physical length @xmath38 . the maximum for the absolute value of the stability eigenvalue",
    "was chosen to be @xmath39 .",
    "the maximum number of successive zeros in the code was restricted to 20 for orbits with length @xmath40 and to 12 for orbits with @xmath41 .",
    "the fundamental problem , and challenge , now is to extract semiclassical eigenvalues in a numerically stable way from the huge periodic orbit set presented in fig .",

    ", we again use the set of periodic orbits presented in fig .  [ fig4 ] together with the averages of different classical quantities over the orbits .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the results from the harmonic inversion of a @xmath119 signal of length @xmath120 ( solid lines ) , which was constructed using the operators @xmath121 ( unity ) , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , where @xmath23 and @xmath124 denote the distance from the center of the system and the absolute value of the angular momentum , respectively .",
    "the eigenvalues are again presented in terms of the energy @xmath111 . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed lines indicate the positions of the exact quantum eigenvalues .",
    "the converged eigenvalues for the wave number @xmath42 have been singled out from the whole set of frequencies obtained by the condition that they should have an imaginary part close to zero and an amplitude close to the theoretical value @xmath115 .",
    "the amplitudes and the imaginary parts of all frequencies obtained are shown in figure [ fig10 ] by circles . in particular , the filled circles denote the frequencies included in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig10]a , the positions of the exact quantum eigenvalues are given by the solid vertical lines .    with the cross - correlated signal , one can now clearly identify eigenvalues up to @xmath125 .",
    "in addition , the convergence of the lowest eigenvalues is improved as compared to the results from the single signal obtained in section [ d=2_hi ] , as can be seen from the amplitudes .",
    "it is not possible to determine to what extent the accuracy of the semiclassical eigenvalues has improved since the results can only be compared with the exact quantum eigenvalues and the size of the semiclassical error is unknown .",
    "again , we have performed the same calculation for various sets of parameters in the harmonic inversion scheme .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows the results from a @xmath119 and from a @xmath126 signal as functions of the signal length .",
    "the @xmath119 signal was constructed from the operators @xmath121 ( unity ) , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and the @xmath126 signal contained the operators @xmath121 , @xmath127 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 . in both diagrams , only the frequencies with an imaginary part @xmath116 and an amplitude @xmath118 were included .",
    "the filled circles mark values with @xmath128 .",
    "the positions of the exact quantum eigenvalues are again marked by the solid vertical lines .",
    "as with the one - dimensional signal analyzed in the previous section , it can be observed that the results for the lowest eigenvalues are very stable with respect to the variation of the signal length as long as the signal is not too short .",
    "however , the very lowest frequencies show a tendency to split into two or more , which was a frequent observation in our calculations when the signal length and the matrix dimensions were chosen too large . the results for the higher eigenvalues depend more sensitively on the signal length as the density of states approaches the limiting resolution that can be achieved with the signal . in this region",
    ", the @xmath126 signal shows a better resolution than the @xmath119 signal .",
    "with the @xmath119 signal and the two largest values of the signal length considered , the lowest eigenvalue was not obtained .",
    "the reason for this probably lies in inaccuracies at the end of the signal , as the signal length approaches the value @xmath129 : in the decimated signal diagonalization scheme , which we used for the harmonic inversion of the signal , the @xmath57 functions in the original signal ( [ c_ab_sc ] ) are replaced with sinc functions @xcite [ @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , every periodic orbit contributes to the signal not only exactly at its scaled action @xmath131 , but also in a range @xmath132 around this point .",
    "if the signal length is close to @xmath129 , also orbits with actions slightly larger than this limit may give non - negligible contributions to the very end of the signal .",
    "since we did only include orbits with @xmath133 , these contributions are missing in our signal .",
    "some eigenvalues between @xmath134 and @xmath135 seem to be particularly hard to obtain from the set of orbits used .",
    "possibly , these eigenvalues are related to the orbits running very deep into the corners between the disks , which were not included in the signal .",
    "we conjecture that the missing orbits as well as the short signal length are again responsible for the deviations especially of the results for higher eigenvalues from the exact quantum values .",
    "we have successfully applied the technique of harmonic inversion to the semiclassical quantization of a system with an extremely rapid proliferation of periodic orbits and strong pruning . with the harmonic inversion of cross - correlated periodic orbit sums",
    "we were able to calculate accurate semiclassical energy eigenvalues of the closed three - disk system up to the region @xmath125 ( a total of 29 levels ) .",
    "this is the first time that such high - lying eigenvalues have been correctly calculated by periodic orbit theory in this system .",
    "our results demonstrate that the harmonic inversion of cross - correlated periodic orbit sums is indeed a powerful method of periodic orbit quantization and allows the stable handling even of huge periodic orbit sets .",
    "in contrast to other methods , which depend on the existence of a complete symbolic code , the harmonic inversion technique is not affected by the strong pruning of orbits . in the closed three - disk system ,",
    "the only restriction for the practical application of the harmonic inversion method lies in the extremely large number of periodic orbits , which is a special feature of this system .",
    "it should also be noted that the semiclassical eigenvalues were obtained without resorting to the mean density of states , which , including all necessary correction terms , is nontrivial to calculate even in the case of the closed three - disk system @xcite .",
    "the present results may stimulate future work on other challenging systems without special structural information on the quantum or classical level .",
    "one example with strong pruning of the symbolic dynamics is the three - dimensional generalization of the closed three - disk billiard , i.e. , a system consisting of four touching spheres at the corners of a regular tetrahedron .",
    "by contrast to the closed three - disk system this is an open system where no functional equation can be applied .",
    "experiments on chaotic light - scattering from the four spheres have recently attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "we thank a.  wirzba for communicating to us quantum mechanical data for the closed three - disk system .",
