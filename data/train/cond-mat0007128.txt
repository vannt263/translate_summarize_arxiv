    "mesoscopic effects in metallic structures are quantum interference phenomena based on electron phase coherence.@xcite this coherence persists over a length @xmath1 which increases with decreasing temperature and usually reaches about @xmath2 in clean metals below @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , much interest was recently devoted to the proximity effect occurring in hybrid mesoscopic structures made of a superconductor ( s ) in clean contact with a normal metal ( n).@xcite so far , transport measurements have been the primary means of investigation of such mesoscopic structures . a promising alternative approach is the use of a very - low temperature scanning probe .",
    "for instance , a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) enables one to access the local density of states with atomic spatial resolution . with regards to the proximity effect",
    ", the local modification of the density of states has been measured at moderately low temperature ( @xmath4 ) by several groups in various kinds of samples.@xcite    here , we present the design and operation of a very - low temperature stm operating at @xmath0 in a dilution refrigerator and featuring a large ( @xmath5 ) scan range . operating at such very low temperatures allows one to gain access to a wide range of phenomena and reduces the thermal smearing of the measured density of states .",
    "the combination of very - low temperature techniques with the constraints of scanning probe microscopy is indeed a demanding task .",
    "this explains the relatively small number of such studies . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only spectroscopic measurement at a temperature below @xmath6 was reported in @xmath7.@xcite a very - low temperature atomic force microscope was operated at @xmath8 in a @xmath9 magnetic field.@xcite images of adsorbed @xmath10 atoms were obtained at @xmath11.@xcite various stms operating at @xmath12 have also been recently reported.@xcite    = 8 cm",
    "we use a home - made upside - down dilution refrigerator called `` sionludi '' with the cold plate placed upwards.@xcite figure [ sionludi ] shows a schematic of the whole setup .",
    "the cryostat is isolated from the building vibrations by spring isolators with a @xmath13 resonant frequency .",
    "the connection to the pumps of the dilution circuit is made of flexible pipes and tubes passing through heavy concrete blocks .",
    "the base temperature with the measurement wiring installed is about @xmath0 in a cylindrical volume of diameter @xmath14 and height @xmath14 .",
    "the main advantages of our cryostat are its natural rigidity , the handy horizontal access and a very rapid cooling / heating cycling .",
    "the whole cryostat is enclosed in a single vacuum which is sealed with a room - temperature o - ring .",
    "there is no @xmath15 bath and therefore no @xmath15 boiling vibrations .",
    "the @xmath16 stage is cooled by a @xmath17 flow from a pressurized helium vessel . during cooling down to @xmath16 , a large flow of @xmath18 mixture thermalizes the dilution stage .",
    "depending on the @xmath19 flow , the cooling down to @xmath16 lasts about 6 hours .",
    "the @xmath18 mixture is injected in the cryostat at a pressure between @xmath20 and @xmath21 . after reaching @xmath16 ,",
    "a fast cooling down to @xmath22 of the dilution stage is ensured by a joule - thomson expansion of the mixture through a dedicated circuit . in the dilution regime",
    ", the limit temperature is reached within 4 hours with the stm installed .",
    "the cooling power is about @xmath23 at @xmath6 .",
    "the stm is enclosed in a hermetic calorimeter screwed on the mixing chamber .",
    "this calorimeter is sealed with an in seal inside a glove box .",
    "the controlled @xmath24 dry atmosphere enables us to minimize surface contamination . before cooling ,",
    "the calorimeter is rinsed several times with pure @xmath10 gas while heating the sample for outgassing .",
    "the calorimeter is then closed with the help of a stainless steel valve with a @xmath10 pressure of about @xmath25 . at low temperature ( @xmath26 ) ,",
    "active carbon grains pump the residual @xmath10 atmosphere .",
    "the stm head is very rigid , @xmath27 in weight and suspended with six springs .",
    "the resonant frequency of this isolation stage has been adjusted to @xmath28 in order to avoid any resonance with the cryostat isolation stage .",
    "the tip is placed near both the inertial center of the suspended head and the symmetry center of the spring s fixation points .",
    "this reduces the displacement of the tip with respect to the base .",
    "residual oscillations of the head are damped by sliding friction .",
    "the head is made of two concentric @xmath29 long piezo - electric pzt-5a tubes .",
    "the piezo tubes are glued with stycast to ti parts .",
    "differential expansion stress during thermal cycles are then minimized since ti and stycast thermal expansion coefficients are close to that of pzt.@xcite the inner tube holds the tip : it is a xy scanner with a @xmath30 scan range at low temperature for a @xmath31 voltage sweep .",
    "its inner electrode is used for the withdrawal of the tip during lateral displacements or coarse approach steps .",
    "the outer piezoelectric tube serves to regulate the sample - tip distance regulation and ensures the inertial displacement .",
    "it holds the two sapphire rods on which the sample inertial carrier slides .",
    "= 3.5 cm = 3.5 cm      our vertical inertial motor is directly inspired from the work of c. renner et al ..",
    "@xcite the carrier is made of two brass parts clamped on the sapphire rods by a compressed spring .",
    "the sliding friction force is about @xmath32 while the carrier weight is @xmath33 .",
    "each part has three well - defined contact points on the rods .",
    "the pulse waveform is a double parabola , so that the acceleration is constant except at the crossover point ( see fig .",
    "2 inset ) .",
    "the duration of one pulse is about @xmath34 .",
    "a single pulse makes the carrier move @xmath35 to @xmath36 at ambient temperature and @xmath37 to @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "both upwards and downwards displacement are possible .",
    "we found that the step length remain reliable as long as the sapphire tubes remain free of adsorbed water . during cooling ,",
    "the carrier is therefore kept at a temperature about @xmath40 larger than the cryostat temperature .",
    "this is ensured by a strain gauge used as a heater and a pt thermometer , both glued on the carrier .",
    "this procedure ensures a low cryosorption on the sapphire rods and on the sample surface .",
    "the heating is stopped at a cryostat temperature of @xmath41 .",
    "an automatic coarse approach is performed during cooling from @xmath42 to @xmath43 . as the sample is placed about 1 mm above the tip at ambient temperature , about 4000 steps are necessary to reach the tunnel contact .",
    "one step consists in withdrawing the tip with the inner tube , sending a pulse on the outer tube and slowly approaching the tip within 5 seconds .",
    "when a tunnel current is detected , the approach is stopped and the tip is withdrawn to a rest position . usually no thermal drift is observed below @xmath44 .",
    "the experimental challenge here is to ensure both an efficient thermalization and a good mechanical decoupling to vibrations for the microscope .",
    "thermalization below @xmath3 is ensured through copper braids connecting the base , the suspended head and the ti parts glued on top of the two tubes .",
    "the sample carrier and the tip are also thermalized through their attached cu measurement wires . a carbon resistor glued on the sample carrier",
    "is used for the measurement of the sample temperature below @xmath3 .",
    "we have characterized the amount of heating due to both coarse approach and scanning .",
    "starting from the stm base temperature ( @xmath45 ) , the sample temperature after a single coarse approach step reaches instantly about @xmath46 .",
    "it afterwards drops down to @xmath45 in a few minutes .",
    "a continuous displacement with about ten steps by second heats the sample up to about @xmath3 and the mixing chamber to @xmath47 .",
    "this corresponds to an injected power of about @xmath48 and a dissipated energy of about @xmath49 per step .",
    "image scanning also heats the system but can be minimized significantly at low scanning speed .",
    "for example , large field imaging ( @xmath50 ) on a large corrugation of the order of @xmath51 may heat the sample to about @xmath46 when the scanning speed is about @xmath52 .      our electronics are home - made .",
    "each incoming wires is filtered by radio - frequency filters at the cryostat entrance .",
    "switchable very low frequency filters with a @xmath53 cut - off are placed at the high - voltage amplifiers outputs .",
    "they are switched on during spectroscopies in order to increase stability of the tip - sample distance .",
    "the tip bias undergoes a @xmath54 reduction at @xmath0 so that the effect of extrinsic noise is reduced .",
    "the tunnel current preamplifier features a @xmath55 bandwidth .",
    "it works at room temperature but the @xmath56 feedback resistance of the input op - amp is thermalized at @xmath57 .",
    "this reduces the contribution of its thermal noise to the total current noise .",
    "the measured total noise is @xmath58 below @xmath59 including the current noise from the op - amp of about @xmath60 . above @xmath59 ,",
    "the noise increases linearly with the frequency because the op - amp voltage noise biases the capacitance of the coaxial wire .",
    "mesoscopic samples prepared by standard lithography often exhibit large corrugation of several hundreds of @xmath61 .",
    "with such a large relief , we need sharp tips with a large aspect ratio .",
    "we use electrochemically - etched pt / ir tips because of their stiffness and low natural oxidation .",
    "tips are prepared with the technique described by lindahl et al.,@xcite with the difference that we avoid bending the tip but instead immerse it in the liquid with a large angle . with this method ,",
    "we obtain routinely a tip radius of about @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ images ] shows two images taken at the temperature of @xmath45 .",
    "let us point out that the ratio of the image sizes is larger than 1000 .",
    "we achieved atomic resolution on hopg graphite at both room temperature and very low temperature ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "on mesoscopic samples , imaging on the scale of a few microns is performed very slowly in order to avoid tip crash and heating of the sample .",
    "a typical @xmath63 pixel image of @xmath64 is acquired in about half an hour .",
    "these images show that we are able to keep a clean sample surface , i.e. , without noticeable contamination , during cooling . heating the sample during cooling",
    "was found to be necessary in order to obtain such a surface quality .        in order to measure a local density of states ,",
    "we acquire i - v characteristics of a fixed sample - tip tunnel junction .",
    "the tip feedback is first set to a large response time constant , the high - voltage low - pass filters are switched on and the feedback loop is opened .",
    "the bias voltage is then swept while the tunnel current is measured .",
    "this sweep lasts up to @xmath65 without modification of the junction .",
    "we usually average over 10 to 40 i - v curves in order to reduce the noise .",
    "the experimental i - v characteristic is then numerically differentiated in order to obtain the differential conductance @xmath66 .",
    "the differential conductance coincides with the local density of states in the zero - temperature limit .    as a test experiment , we measured the density of states at the surface of plain superconducting layers .",
    "figure [ spectrostm ] shows the experimental i - v characteristic and the deduced differential conductance @xmath67 at the surface of an al layer .",
    "these data are representative of the quality of our spectroscopy measurements , although in this case the tip is presumably dug into the surface al oxide . from our measurements , we can estimate a maximum vibration amplitude of about @xmath68 .",
    "the differential conductance @xmath67 clearly shows a superconducting gap .",
    "it is zero in the vicinity of the fermi level ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we described this data using a bcs density of states convoluted by a thermal distribution function , without broadening by a finite quasiparticle lifetime.@xcite the value of the al gap @xmath70 derived from the fit is in agreement with the expected value .",
    "the effective temperature derived from the fit is @xmath71 . as the sample temperature was in every case about @xmath45 ,",
    "the origin of this effective temperature increase is unclear at present .",
    "nevertheless , our data show that we can identify the measured differential conductance with the local density of states if the desired resolution remains larger than @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ bulles ] shows a preliminary experiment performed on a normal metal - superconductor junction .",
    "we fabricated the sample by successive in - situ evaporation of nb and au in a uhv chamber .",
    "nb was evaporated first through a si mask put in contact with the si substrate .",
    "the mask was a @xmath73 thick si membrane patterned by e - beam lithography .",
    "the mask was then mechanically removed and a uniform au layer was deposited , without breaking vacuum .",
    "this ensures a high transparency of the nb - au interface .",
    "the nb islands are about @xmath74 wide and their center to center distance is @xmath75 .",
    "only a few nb islands are accessible within the stm scan range .",
    "as shown in the stm image , the nb islands are rather rounded .",
    "this is due to the thickness of the mask and the imperfection of the contact between the mask and the substrate .",
    "we measured the differential conductance at various locations while moving the tip away from the center of a nb island . in order to reduce the hysteresis of the scanner below @xmath76",
    ", we had to use a scanning speed below @xmath77 . in fig .",
    "[ bulles ] , we clearly see the spatial dependence of the density of states . the spectrum with the largest gap was taken near the center of the nb island : it can be well described by a bcs density of states .",
    "the magnitude of the energy gap is reduced compared to the nb value because of the influence of the au layer .",
    "away from the nb island , the density of states has a triangular shape .",
    "it is the signature of the proximity effect .",
    "the characteristic decay length of the proximity effect appears to be about @xmath78 . a detailed description of our results by the quasiclassical theory @xcite is under way .",
    "this work greatly beneficiated from the help of a. benoit , h. rodenas and k. hasselbach in the design , fabrication and optimization of the `` sionludi '' cryostat .",
