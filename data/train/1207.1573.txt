    "diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) are absorption features ubiquitously detected in the spectra of reddened stars .",
    "they are observed from the near uv , optical , to the near infrared , and arise from the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "dibs were first discovered by heger ( 1922 ) . to date over 400 dibs have been detected ( sarre 2006 ; hobbs et al .",

    "the most prominent dibs in the optical , e.g. , @xmath0@xmath04429 , 5780 , 5797 , are well studied .",
    "they are known empirically to trace the neutral hydrogen phase of the ism , with intensities that correlate well with the line - of - sight color excess @xmath1 , the neutral hydrogen column density and the na  i column density ( e.g. , herbig 1993 ; friedman et al . 2011 ) .",
    "correlations between different dibs deduced from samples of spectra towards various sight - lines have been used to infer the origin(s ) of the bands  sets of well - correlated dibs probably arise from the same or similar carriers ( krelowsky & walker 1987 ; josafatsson & snow 1987 ; westerlund & krelowsky 1989 ; cami et al .",

    "although dibs have been widely detected and studied , none of them have been spectroscopically identified and their carriers ( widely believed to be grains or molecules ) remain elusive ( herbig 1995 ; sarre 2006 ) .",

    "we use a template subtraction method to detect dibs in the sdss spectra .",
    "this method requires a sample of ( reddened ) target stars and an ( unreddened / low - reddening ) control sample of stars of similar spectral type .",
    "target stars are defined as stars whose spectra are expected to display dib features .",
    "control stars are those whose spectra posses extremely weak or no dib features , so that the spectra can be used to construct spectral templates containing no dibs . in this section ,",
    "selections of target and control stars from the sdss spectroscopic survey as well as the technique of template subtraction are introduced .",
    "both samples of target and control stars are selected from the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ; abazajian et al .",
    "sdss dr7 contains spectra of more than 300,000 stars .",
    "about 240,000 of them are from the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ; yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) , focused on the galactic science .",
    "we select target stars as those with line - of - sight extinctions @xmath1",
    "@xmath8 0.3 and of spectra of signal - to - noise ratios s / n @xmath8 40 .",
    "we restrict targets to objects with valid determinations of effective temperature , surface gravity log  @xmath9  and metallicity [ fe / h ]   as given by the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp , lee et al .",
    "2008a , b ; allende prieto et al . 2008 ; lee et al .",
    "2011 ; smolinski et al . 2011 ) .",
    "typical uncertainties of those parameters are 180 k , 0.25 dex and 0.23 dex for , log  @xmath9  and [ fe / h ] , respectively , dominated by systematic errors ( schlesinger et al . 2010 ; smolinski et al . 2011 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "in the current work we are mainly interested in the relative ranking of stars in the , log  @xmath9  and [ fe / h ]   parameter spaces , such that systematic uncertainties are not important . for robust template subtraction",
    ", we further require the errors of , log  @xmath9  and [ fe / h ]  to be smaller than 100 k , 0.2 dex and 0.1 dex , respectively .",

    "( 1998 ) . in total , 2,164 target stars are selected .",
    "their spatial and stellar parameter distributions are displayed in fig.1 .",
    "the targets come from spectroscopic plates that spread over a large sky area ( @xmath10 ,  @xmath11 ) , and involve stars of a wide range of spectral type , luminosity class and metallicity . given the requirements on s / n ratio and line - of - sight extinction , most targets are from bright segue plates towards low galactic latitudes",
    ". essentially , all the target stars are brighter than 17 in @xmath9 band .",
    "the requirements suggest that the majority of the target stars are from the galactic disk , with the remaining small fraction from the halo .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that most targets have [ fe / h ]  higher than @xmath120.7 , as shown in the bottom left panel of fig.1 .     and latitude @xmath13 .",

    "the cuts on errors of , log  @xmath9  and [ fe / h ]  are the same as target stars . in total ,",
    "62,266 stars are selected .",
    "given the large number of control stars , only those with the highest s / n ratios are used as templates , as described below .",
    "the idea of template subtraction method is straightforward . for each star in the target sample , stars of similar spectral types ,",
    "luminosity classes and metallicities are selected from the control sample .",
    "quantitatively , we require the differences in , log  @xmath9  and [ fe / h ]  between a control and a target star to be smaller than 100 k , 0.5 dex and 0.2 dex , respectively . secondly , after correcting for differences in radial velocities of control stars relative to the target star , spectra of the first one hundred control stars of highest s / n ratios are co - added to construct a template spectrum of very high s / n ratio . in cases where the number of control stars is less than one hundred , all control stars satisfying the above criteria are used . for the two dib features of interest here , @xmath05780 and @xmath06283 , a segment of the template spectrum of a width of 200 centered around the feature of concern is scaled to the target spectrum , subtracted and then rectified using the continuum level determined from the _ scaled _ template spectrum .",
    "this certificated residual spectrum is devoid of stellar absorption features and enhances dib features in cases of a good template matching . to account for the different amount of extinction and other types of mismatch of the template and target spectra ,",
    "the scaling factors of the segment of the template spectrum to target spectrum are fitted with a linear polynomial of constant slope after masking the dib feature .",
    "note that the strength of a dib feature is very sensitive to the scaling factor at the wavelength of the feature , which is accurately estimated in the above fitting in cases of a good template matching .",
    "given the relatively narrow wavelength span under consideration here , a continuum of constant slope is also used in fitting the continuum level of the _ scaled _ template spectrum .",
    "this continuum level is assumed to be equally applicable to the target spectrum .",
    "it is much easier to accurately determine the continuum level of the _ scaled _ template spectrum than that of the target , given the former generally has a very high s / n ratio that makes it easy to mask and exclude regions of stellar absorption features in the spectrum .",
    "finally , we search for the dib absorption feature around the expected wavelength in the rectified residual spectrum and measure its equivalent width using a line fitting method .    the dib  @xmath05780 contains two blended components , a narrow and a much broader one .",
    "the narrow and broad components have widths of 2.07 and 15.5 centered at 5780.59 and 5779.48 , respectively ( jenniskens & dsert 1994 ) .",
    "slightly different values , a width of 2.11 centered at 5780.48 for the narrow component , were given by hobbs et al .",
    "owing in part to the difficulty in reliably defining the continuum level for the broad component , in the current work only the strengths of the narrow component will be considered , the dib  @xmath05780 refers only to its narrow component .",
    "given that the typical doppler spread measured from interstellar atomic lines toward reddened stars ( @xmath1  @xmath16 0.8 ) is about 7.5 km s@xmath17 ( welty & hobbs 2001 ) and the low spectral resolution of sdss data , doppler broadening is likely to be negligible .",
    "as a consequence , using a gaussian profile of a fixed fwhm 3.85 to fit and measure the strengths of the dib  @xmath05780 is a good approximation .",
    "here 3.85 is the expected fwhm of the dib  @xmath05780 after taking into account its intrinsic width and the sdss instrumental broadening .",
    "the dib  @xmath06283 also shows a relatively deep , narrow feature superimposed on a much shallower , broader component .",
    "examinations of the dib  @xmath06283 observed with high resolving powers show that it exhibits a profile closely resembling a lorentzian one , with its broad wings possibly contaminated by several weak overlapping dib features ( jenniskens & dsert 1993 ; drosback 2006 ) .",
    "hobbs et al . ( 2008 ) estimated a fwhm of 4.77 and a central wavelength of 6283.83 for the dib  @xmath06283 from the echelle spectra of the double - lined spectroscopic binary hd204820 .",
    "drosback ( 2006 ) obtained a fwhm of @xmath18 from a larger sample . in this work ,",
    "a fixed - width voigt profile resulting from a convolution of a lorentz profile of a fwhm 4.0 and a gaussian profile of a fwhm 3.49 ( the instrumental width of sdss spectra ) , is used to fit and measure the strengths of dib  @xmath06283 . note that the dib  @xmath06283 feature",
    "is badly affected by telluric absorption features .",
    "however , all released sdss spectra have been corrected for telluric absorptions by dividing spectra of hot standard stars , so the measurements of dib  @xmath06283 in this work should not be much affected by telluric absorptions .",
    "sample spectra and the resultant fits are illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "note in this figure the spectra are plotted in vacuum wavelengths . the standard formula given by morton ( 1991 )",

    "the dibs  @xmath0@xmath05780 , 6283 are detected in spectra of almost all target stars of a wide variety of types , from hot a to cool k types , dwarfs and giants , metal - rich and -poor stars .",

    "examples of the fitting are over - plotted in fig.2 . in most cases ,",
    "the target and template spectra match well and the fitting performs reasonably . in a few cases where there are not enough control stars to construct a matching template of high fidelity , the dib features are weak , the spectra are of low s / n ratios or there are some defects in the spectra , the fitting procedure may deliver poor or even unreliable results .",
    "nevertheless , we can still confirm the presence of the dib features in most of those spectra by visual inspection .",
    "@xmath3(5780 ) and @xmath3(6283 ) are very sensitive to the continuum levels , particularly for @xmath3(6283 ) because of its broad width . to estimate the uncertainties caused by continuum determinations , we have re - fitted the dibs  @xmath0@xmath05780 , 6283 with their continuum levels fixed to zero .",

    "measured with varying continuum levels are also strong correlated with ( within an uncertainty of 0.09 ) , but 18 per cent systematically larger than those measured with fixed ones .",

    "http://www.lamost.org/website/en/ ) , is an innovative quasi - meridian reflecting schmidt telescope that is capable of recording spectra of up to 4,000 objects simultaneously in a field of view of 5@xmath30 in diameter .",
    "following a two - year commissioning initiated in september , 2009 and a one - year pilot survey initiated in october , 2011 , the lamost formal galactic and extragalactic surveys are expected to commence in fall of 2012 ( zhao et al .",
    "2012 ) .    given the similar spectral resolving powers of sdss and lamost , dibs should be also detectable in the lamost spectra .",
    "given that the data reduction pipelines of lamost are still under development and reliable stellar parameter estimates are not available yet , the template subtraction method currently does not work for the lamost data .",
    "however , taking advantage of the smooth stellar continua of hot early - type stars , dibs are also easily identified in the lamost low - resolution spectra . as an example , at least nine dib features ( @xmath0@xmath04429 , 5780 , 5797 , 6203 , 6283 , 6532 , 6613 , 6993 , 8621 ) have been detected in the spectra of a lamost target ( fig.5 ) .",
    "note the prominence of dibs  @xmath0@xmath05780 , 6283 .",
    "the target was observed on december 21 , 2009 with the half - slit ( 1.65 arcsec ) mode ( r @xmath2  2,000 ) during the commissioning phase of lamost .",
    "three exposures , each of 900s , were obtained .",
    "the data were reduced using the lamost 2d pipeline ( luo , zhang & zhao 2004 ) following the standard procedure , including bias subtraction , cosmic - ray removal , 1d spectral extraction , flat - fielding and wavelength calibration .",
    "sky subtraction was not performed .",
    "this did not affect the identification of dib features given the weakness of sky continuum level compared to that of the target .",
    "flux calibration was also not necessary .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the target is an emission line star first discovered by kohoutek &  wehmeyer ( 1999 ) .",
    "its broad and prominent h@xmath31 emission line is clearly seen in the bottom left panel of fig.5 .",
    "using a template subtraction method , we have successfully identified the dibs  @xmath0@xmath05780 , 6283 in the sdss low - resolution spectra of a sample of about 2,000 stars and measured their equivalent widths and velocities .",
    "the sample is by far the largest of stars with dibs detected and measured .",
    "the sample stars are distributed over a large sky area and cover a wide range of stellar parameters of effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity , confirming that the carriers of dibs are ubiquitous in the diffuse ism .",
    "we use the sample to investigate the relations between the equivalent widths of the dibs  @xmath0@xmath05780 , 6283 and sight - line extinctions , and find results consistent with previous works .",
    "the data however show large scatters .",
    "some of the scatters are due to the measurement uncertainties , especially for spectra of limited s / n ratios .",
    "a significant fraction of the scatters are probably intrinsic  the data of friedman et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also show significant scattering .",
    "identifying potential environmental factors that may lead to the complexities of observed properties of dibs is pivotal to reveal the nature of dibs .",
    "to achieve such a goal , accurate measurements of dibs towards a large number of sight - lines probing a variety of environments with low - cost spectra of low and intermediate resolution as illustrated in the current work should be an effective approach .",
    "apart from the limited s / n ratios of spectra , other sources of uncertainties in measuring the dibs  @xmath0@xmath05780 , 6283 in this work mainly include a mismatch between a target and template spectrum , continuum determinations and profile fitting of the dib features with a single gaussian / voigt .",
    "a mismatch of a target and template spectrum may occur if the target is of a rare spectral type , the stellar parameters of the target star are in significant error or there are some defects ( e.g. , residual telluric absorption features ) in its spectrum .",
    "such cases can in principle be flagged out and excluded from the sample in the future .",
    "a mismatch can also happen if the distribution of stellar parameters of the control sample is biased .",
    "such cases can be avoided by more careful selections of control stars . to reduce the uncertainties of continuum levels , sophisticated ways to define stellar continuum are needed . to reduce the uncertainties introduced by a single gaussian / voigt profile fitting",
    ", one can explore deblending the dib  @xmath05780 with two gaussians and fitting the dib  @xmath06283 with measured profiles .",
    "it might be possible to carry out the fitting with the central wavelengths of individual components of the dibs tied together , reducing the number of degrees of freedom of the fitting function .",
    "for spectra of high s / n ratios , it might be feasible to define indexes of dibs and measure them by direct integration .",
    "it is worth mentioning that hot stars have few strong absorption lines blending with dibs . in such cases ,",
    "template spectra are not even needed to identify dibs .",
    "as illustrated by the example presented in the previous section , in addition to the strong dibs  @xmath0@xmath05780 , 6283 , seven other dibs can be easily identified in low - resolution spectra of such a hot star .",
    "the strengths of the dib features can also be measured by direct integration given sufficient high s / n ratios .",
    "given that the light of a star - burst galaxy is dominated by contribution from luminous hot stars , searching for the strong dibs ( e.g. , dibs  @xmath0@xmath05780 , 6283 ) in their sdss spectra might be feasible .",
    "searching and measuring dibs in low - resolution spectra , now widely available for a huge number of objects , have obviously the potential to tackle a number of problems of the ism .",
    "for example , they can be used to probe the distribution and properties of the dibs , estimate the extinction towards individual stars , trace the amount of ism absorption and search for extremely metal - poor stars .",
    "the data will help unveil the nature of dibs .",
    "large scale spectroscopic surveys , such as the on - going rave and sdss , and the up - coming lamost galactic spectral surveys will yield detections of dibs ( e.g. , @xmath0@xmath04429 , 5780 , 5797 , 6203 , 6283 , 6613 , 6993 , 8621 ) in hundreds of thousands stars of a variety of spectral types , located in different parts and environments of the milky way .",
    "the huge database will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the demographical distribution and nature of dibs as well as using dibs to probe the distribution and properties of the ism and the dust extinction .",
    "given the large sample , targets exhibiting particularly interesting features can be selected and followed with high - resolution spectroscopic observations .",
    "strengths of dibs measured with low - resolution spectroscopy can be used to estimate extinction towards a large number of individual stars targeted in large scale spectroscopic surveys .",
    "extinction is one of the most fundamental stellar parameters and affects the determinations of others ( i.e. effective temperature , metallicity and distance ) . as mentioned above , extinction values given by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have several limitations , especially for the low galactic latitude regions . from the relations between the strengths of dibs and the line - of - sight color excess , strengths of dibs measured with low - resolution spectroscopy",
    "provide an independent way to estimate extinction of individual stars .",
    "this is especially useful for the up - coming lamost digital sky survey of the galactic anti - center ( dss - gac ; liu et al .",
    "2012 , in prep ) .",
    "the dss - gac project aims to obtain spectra for a statistically complete sample of over three million stars down to 18.5 limiting magnitude in r- band , distributed in a contiguous area of 3438 square degree ( @xmath32 ) and sampling a significant volume of the galactic thin / thick disks , halo and their interfaces .",
    "the project will target approximately 1,000 stars per square degree outside the galactic plane ( @xmath33 @xmath34 3.5@xmath35 ) and twice that within the galactic plane .",
    "although extinction towards galactic anti - center is much lower than towards the center , there are regions of high extinction where the extinction map of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is inapplicable .",
    "on the other hand , information of extinction is required to select spectral standard stars and perform flux calibration .",
    "information of extinction is also required to interpret the target selection algorithms of the survey and derive basic stellar parameters and the selection function of the survey .",
    "the possibility of estimating the extinction to individual star via the observed dib strengths , unaffected by flux calibration , should be very helpful to the dss - gac project . in the meantime ,",
    "the dss - gac project will deliver a huge database to study dibs .",
    "the database will generate a three - dimensional extinction map towards the galactic anti - center , with distances of individual stars estimated from either a spectro - photometric analysis or directly from the parallax measurements to be delivered by the forth - coming gaia mission ( perryman et al .",
    "finally , given the tight correlations between dib strengths ( especially the dib  @xmath05780 ; friedman et al .",
    "2011 ) and the neutral hydrogen column density , the database can be further used to derive the three - dimensional distribution of the neutral hydrogen , probe the properties , structure and kinematics of the ism , and constrain the peculiar motion of the sun with respect to the local standard of rest .",
    "it is possible that detections of dibs with low - resolution spectroscopy may provide a way to correct for contamination of the ism ca  ii absorption when searching for extremely metal - poor stars with low - resolution spectroscopic surveys",
    ". discovery of extremely metal - poor stars is of great importance in understanding the nature and the initial mass function of the first stars , the processes of element production during the early evolution phase of the milky way and the metallicity distribution function of the galactic halo ( beers & christlieb , 2005 ) .",
    "low - resolution spectroscopic surveys have been playing an important role in searching for very metal - poor stars ( beers & carollo 2008 ; beers et al 2009 ; fulbright et al .",
    "2010 ) . under low spectral resolution ,",
    "the stellar ca  ii absorption lines blend with absorption arising from intervening ism , leading to overestimated stellar metallicities .",
    "this problem becomes more severe as stars get more metal - poor .",
    "strengths of certain dibs might provide a way to correct for the ism ca  ii absorption . using high - resolution spectra of a sample of 35 stars ,",
    "galazutdinov et al . (",
    "2004 ) show that the strengths of some dibs correlate well with the interstellar k  i lines but to a much lower degree with the ca  ii lines . from a sample of several hundred low - resolution spectra of o - type stars , penades ordaz et al .",
    "( 2011 ) find a moderately low correlation coefficient between the ca  ii  k line absorption and the extinction with a peculiar spatial distribution that they ascribe to a relationship between absorption saturation and velocity profile of the ca  ii  k line . nevertheless , this is a problem worth further investigations .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the template subtraction technique used in the current work can be adapted to tackle other problems , such as searching for peculiar stars of unusual characteristics in a large spectroscopic database where templates of `` normal '' stars can be easily constructed .",
    "examples of such peculiar objects include binaries , emission line stars and stars of peculiar chemical composition .    * acknowledgments * we would like to thank the referee , dr .",
