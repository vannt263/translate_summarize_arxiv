    "the double - beta ( @xmath8 ) decay is an extremely rare nuclear transition in those even - even nuclides where ordinary beta decay is either forbidden by conservation of energy or highly suppressed by a large spin change . while the two - neutrino mode of the decay ( @xmath9 ) , being allowed in the standard model of particles ( sm ) , was observed experimentally after long - time efforts ( see , e.g. , reviews @xcite ) , the neutrinoless double - beta ( @xmath10 ) decay violates lepton number conservation @xcite and is therefore forbidden in the framework of the sm .",
    "the process is considered as a unique way to investigate properties of neutrino and test many other hypothetical effects beyond the sm implying lepton number non conservation .",
    "the study of @xmath10 decay can establish the majorana nature of neutrino , help determine the scale of the neutrino mass , the neutrino - mass hierarchy and the majorana cp - violating phases , check possible contribution of hypothetical right - handed currents admixture to weak interaction , the existence of nambu - goldstone bosons ( majorons ) , and many other new - physics effects @xcite .    despite almost seventy years of experimental activity ,",
    "the @xmath10 decay has not been observed yet .",
    "the most sensitive experiments give half - life limits on the level of @xmath11 y ( see reviews @xcite , and the recent kamland - zen results  @xcite ) , which correspond to effective majorana neutrino mass limits on the level of @xmath12 ev . the next - generation experiments should explore the inverted region of the neutrino mass ( @xmath13 ev ) and develop a technology to go towards the normal - hierarchy mass scale ( @xmath14 ev ) . the experimental sensitivity requested to explore the inverted - hierarchy region ( for the nuclei with the highest decay probability ) is on the level of @xmath15  y. the sensitivity requirements are even much stronger taking into account certain problems of nuclear - matrix - element calculation accuracy and a possible quenching of the axial vector coupling constant ( @xmath16 )  @xcite .    in light of the foregoing",
    ", cryogenic scintillating bolometers look very promising detectors for the next generation @xmath10 experiments thanks to their high energy resolution ( a few kev ) , @xmath17  % detection efficiency , and excellent particle identification ability @xcite .",
    "the isotope @xmath0mo is one of the most promising @xmath8 nuclei taking into account the high energy of the decay ( @xmath18 kev @xcite ) , the comparatively high natural isotopic abundance ( @xmath19 @xcite ) , and the possibility of isotopical separation by centrifugation in a large amount .",
    "the recent calculations of nuclear matrix elements for the @xmath10 decay of @xmath0mo give comparatively `` short '' half - life in the range of @xmath20  y @xcite ( for an effective majorana neutrino mass equal to 0.05 ev , assuming the standard value of the axial vector coupling constant @xmath21 , and using the recent calculations of the phase - space factor from ref .",

    "the availability of molybdenum - containing scintillators to be operated as cryogenic scintillating bolometers is an important practical advantage of @xmath0mo .",
    "recently , lithium molybdate ( li@xmath1moo@xmath2 ) crystal scintillators were successfully tested as scintillating bolometers @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a technique to grow large - volume , high - quality li@xmath1moo@xmath2 crystal scintillators with low radioactive contamination  embedding also enriched @xmath0mo  was developed in the framework of the lumineu  @xcite and isotta  @xcite projects with outstanding results  @xcite .",
    "this makes this material very promising for @xmath10 experiments with @xmath0mo .",
    "however , random coinciding events , especially of the @xmath9 decay of @xmath0mo , can produce background due to the poor time resolution of cryogenic detectors @xcite .",
    "this effect can be a major source of background in the region of interest on the level of @xmath22 counts/(kev@xmath5kg@xmath5y ) @xcite , depending on the detector volume and performance , and on the data - analysis approach . as it was demonstrated in @xcite",
    "the rejection efficiency substantially depends on the time properties and signal - to - noise ratio of the detector .",
    "here we analyze the advantages of a cryogenic light detector operated with neganov - luke amplification @xcite to reject pile - up signals in a li@xmath1moo@xmath2-based scintillating bolometer .",
    "in scintillating bolometers for @xmath10 search , employed in the lumineu @xcite and lucifer @xcite projects , the light emitted by the scintillating crystal is detected and measured by an auxiliary bolometer , consisting of a pure ge wafer , working as light collector and energy absorber .",
    "the wafer is coupled to a neutron transmutation doped ( ntd ) ge thermistor , serving as a temperature sensor .",
    "details on these light detectors can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    ", we will consider ge wafers with a diameter of 44 mm and a thickness of 0.17 mm , as those used by the lucifer and lumineu collaborations in their pilot experiments .",
    "in general , the performances of these light detectors present a significant spread , due to a difficult reproduction of the thermal couplings among detector elements , but they are always largely sufficient to separate @xmath23 and @xmath24 particles in the region of interest for @xmath10 decay of @xmath0mo ( around 3034 kev ) , exploiting their different light yields  @xcite .",
    "an average - performance detector based on the ntd ge technology in the lumineu or lucifer context , in optimized noise conditions , has typically a baseline width of the order of @xmath25  ev rms , even if occasionally much better values  around @xmath26  ev rms  are observed @xcite .",
    "we will take conservatively the former value for the discussion that will follow .",
    "the light collected in a li@xmath1moo@xmath2 scintillating bolometer corresponds to an energy deposition in the light detector of about 1  kev when 1  mev total energy is released by electrons in the scintillator . in previous tests with this compound ,",
    "lower values were observed ( of the order of 0.4 kev / mev @xcite or 0.7 kev / mev @xcite ) , but recently it was possible to obtain systematically light yields close to @xmath27  kev / mev thanks to an improved crystal quality  @xcite .",
    "the signal in the light detector induced by a @xmath10 event corresponds therefore to about 3  kev energy .",
    "consequently , a typical signal - to - noise ratio ( defined as the ratio of the signal amplitude to the standard deviation of the noise baseline ) of light detectors operated with li@xmath1moo@xmath2 crystal scintillators is @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in the light channel can be enhanced by a large factor by exploiting the neganov - luke effect @xcite , keeping essentially the same light - detector structure and materials and especially the same temperature sensor .",
    "the latter point is of great importance in view of a large scale experiment like that proposed by the cupid group of interest  @xcite , since the ntd ge readout is very simple and involves only well - established room - temperature electronics with easy channel multiplication @xcite .",
    "the neganov - luke effect consists in a heat - mediated voltage - assisted measurement of the charge developed in a semiconductor detector by impinging radiation .",
    "it enables the detection of very small amount of charges , down to a few electron - hole pairs , with much better sensitivities with respect to the conventional readout based on charge - sensitive amplifiers . to this aim ,",
    "the semiconductor bolometric absorber is provided with electrodes on its surface , which are used to apply an electric field in the absorber volume .",
    "the work done by the fields on the drifting charges can be detected in form of heat by ntd ge thermistors . in the case of our 44-mm - diameter ge disk ,",
    "the electrodes are a set of concentric al rings deposited on one surface by evaporation with a shadow mask .",
    "the rings are electrically connected by means of ultrasonic wedge bonding with an alternate pattern .",
    "this allows applying a given voltage drop between any couple of adjacent rings and producing an electric field parallel to the surface . a photograph of the device is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : photo - light - detector ] .",
    "the use of a ring structure , instead of a peripheral and central electrode only , enables to increase the charge - collecting electric field for a given applied voltage and to decrease the path length of the charges towards the electrodes , implying a lower trapping probability .",
    "several neganov - luke light detectors , with different inter - electrode pitches and adding in some samples a sio antireflective coating with a thickness of 70 nm @xcite , were fabricated , tested and characterized .",
    "one of these devices has been used succesfully to detect the tiny cherenkov light emitted by a teo@xmath1 crystal @xcite , in the framework of a r&d activity for an improvement of the @xmath10 detectors used in the cuore experiment @xcite and designed to be used in its proposed evolution cupid @xcite . in general",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to apply safely @xmath29  v to the electrode structure discussed above and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : photo - light - detector ] , without the development of leakage currents .",
    "often , it is possible to reach @xmath25  v. the signal amplification achievable on led pulses in the infrared range is spectacular , of the order of @xmath28 . the baseline noise remains almost constant under signal neganov - luke amplification , with a slight increase observed sometimes in the high - voltage range ( @xmath30  v ) .    of course , it is important to understand and control the noise sources which contribute to the baseline fluctuations . these are mainly due to parasitic effects , like vibrations ( which induce temperature fluctuations of ge wafer ) , microphonic noise ( generated by the readout - wire mechanical oscillations ) , and , to a minor extent , intrinsic noise of the thermistor ( johnson and 1/f noise ) and of the preamplifier .",
    "our rejection method could take advantage of a mitigation of these contributions , which however are not amplified by the neganov - luke effect , as discussed above .",
    "a more dangerous noise source that we have observed is related to the aforementioned leakage currents developed at high voltages .",
    "the associated fluctuations can contribute significantly to the noise and the neganov - luke effect amplifies them along with the signal .",
    "this sets an intrinsic upper limit to the achievable gain in terms of signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the best results obtained up to now is an improvement of the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath31 with respect to the performance in absence of neganov - luke effect , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : improvement - snr ] .",
    "we are confident however that this figure can be largely improved , as these results are very preliminary and an extensive optimization work is still to be done in terms of electrode configuration , deposition procedure and noise control .",
    "we will assume in the following that a gain of @xmath32 can be obtained , close to what already achieved and rather conservative with respect to the potential of this technology .",
    "we would like to stress that the improvement in terms of signal - to - noise ratio obtained by the neganov - luke effect can not increase the light - detector energy resolution beyond the limit set by the photon statistics . at the @xmath0mo @xmath10 characteristic energy , about 1450 scintillation photons",
    "are collected by the light detector , as @xmath27  kev is the total energy contained in the corresponding scintillation pulse .",
    "( the light emission from li@xmath1moo@xmath2 has an intensity maximum at @xmath33  nm  @xcite , which corresponds to a photon energy of 2.07 ev . ) a poissonian standard deviation of @xmath34  40 photons is therefore expected , corresponding to an intrinsic limit on the energy resolution of @xmath35  ev .",
    "this however plays no role in our following discussion about pile - up rejection , which requires as much as possible noise - free pulses and is not affected by an energy - resolution loss due to the granularity of the energy carriers .",

    "in order to discriminate random coincident events in scintillating bolometers , it is possible to exploit pulse - shape analysis either in the heat or in the light channel signals .",
    "the formers are slower but feature a much better signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "even if light signals can provide a significant discrimination with the state - of - the - art light detectors  @xcite , heat signals are superior in terms of rejection efficiency  @xcite as their larger signal - to - noise ratio ( typically of the order of @xmath36 ) prevails .",
    "the rationale of using neganov - luke light detectors is to exploit the ten - time faster light signals in terms of rise - time with a signal - to - noise ratio that approaches that of the heat channel .",
    "we have investigated the rejection efficiency that can be obtained with this light - detector technology , and consequently the final background rate in the region of interest due to random coincidences of two - neutrino @xmath8 decay , assuming a single module consisting of a cylindrical li@xmath1@xmath0moo@xmath2 crystal with a diameter of 44  mm and a height of 60  mm , coupled to a neganov - luke light detector like the one described in the previous section ( an array of single modules with these features will be tested in the framework of the cupid r&d program ) .",
    "assuming 100% enrichment , such a crystal contains @xmath37 @xmath0mo nuclei .",
    "the consequent random - coincidence background rate @xmath38 amounts to  @xcite :    @xmath39   \\approx 3.37 \\times 10^{-4 } \\cdot \\left [ t_r/\\rm{1 \\ , ms } \\right ] ,   \\label{eq : bkg}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the pulse - pair resolving time .",
    "the assumption underlying this formula is that two signals separated by an interval shorter than @xmath40 will be analysed as a single pulse with an amplitude given by the sum of the two individual ones , while they will be recognized as double if the time separation is longer than @xmath40 .",
    "ten thousands of noise baseline samples and a scintillation reference pulse were used to generate sets of single and randomly coincident pulses .",
    "the noise samples were acquired by a real neganov - luke light - detector baseline with a sampling frequency of 20  ksps . in order to build the scintillation reference pulse",
    ", we took 40 individual scintillation pulses ( sampled with 1  ksps ) from an ordinary light detector based on a ge disk instrumented with an ntd ge thermistor , in a setup similar to that described in ref .",
    "we stress that this device is identical to those equipped with al rings to exploit the neganov - luke effect .",
    "the light detector was coupled to a 240  g li@xmath1moo@xmath2 scintillating bolometer .",
    "the scintillation pulses used to build the reference pulse corresponded to @xmath41 and @xmath24 events with energies in the 1.5 - 2.6 mev range in the li@xmath1moo@xmath2 scintillator .",
    "the reference pulse was obtained by fitting the average pulse built on these 40 individual light signals and therefore it represents faithfully the shape of a scintillation signal .",
    "the phenomenological fitting function is a sum of three exponentials with 3 free amplitudes and 3 free time constants .",
    "it is not based on a detector - response model , but it represents very accurately the pulse shape .",
    "the rise - time of the reference pulse ( defined as the time to change the pulse amplitude on the front edge from 10% to 90% of its maximum ) is @xmath42  ms , while the decay time ( the time to change the pulse amplitude on the pulse decay from 90% to 30% of its maximum ) is @xmath43 ms .    to generate randomly coinciding light signals corresponding to overlapping heat signals ( assuming 1 kev / mev light - to - heat ratio as discussed above ) in the region of the @xmath0mo @xmath44 value",

    "the choice of the factor 3.3 is arbitrary .",
    "it garantees that pulses separated by a longer interval are recognized as double with 100% efficiency , as discussed below .",
    "as far as this condition is respected , the final results on the rejection efficiency do not depend on the value of this factor .",

    "the mean - time method was applied to discriminate randomly coincident events .",

    "a high signal - to - noise ratio is a crucial characteristic for a cryogenic light detector in order to achieve a high discrimination efficiency of pile - up events , mostly because this increases the accuracy of the pulse - origin determination , on which the efficiency depends substantially .    in a heat - energy window of 5 kev , in agreement with the energy resolution of the bolometric technique , we expect therefore a background contribution from random coincidences of two - neutrino @xmath8 events inferior to 1  counts/(ton@xmath5y ) .",
