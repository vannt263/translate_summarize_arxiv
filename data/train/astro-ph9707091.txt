    "feast and catchpole ( 1997 = fc97 hereafter ) have recently published the first results on parallaxes to galactic cepheids based on measurements from the hipparcos satellite .",
    "they list data for the 26 highest signal - to - noise cepheid parallaxes ; and after an extensive series of reductions ( see their table 2 ) they conclude that the best fit pl relation for the visual bandpass is @xmath5 , with a standard error on the hipparcos zero point of @xmath6  mag , adopting the slope from prior work on lmc cepheids .",
    "the authors go on to apply this v - band solution to determining the distance modulus of the lmc corrected for @xmath7  mag . adding a metallicity correction of + 0.042  mag and adopting @xmath8 from caldwell & laney ( 1991 ) gives @xmath9  mag . in this _",
    "letter _ we go beyond the v - band pl relation and explore the implications of the hipparcos data for the multiwavelength calibrations of the cepheid pl relation from the blue ( b - band ) out into the near infrared ( 2.2@xmath10 m k - band ) .",
    "in figure  1 we compare differentially four calibrations ( heavy dotted lines ) of the v - band cepheid pl relation with the fc97 hipparcos - based relation ( solid horizontal lines ) . the first two comparisons ( in the upper two panels )",
    "are with the relations given by madore & freedman ( 1991 ; hereafter mf91 ) , derived from self - consistent sets of lmc cepheid data whose stars either had complete @xmath11 observations ( mf91.1 containing 32 cepheids ) or complete @xmath12 observations ( mf91.2 containing 25 stars ) these first two solutions indicate the sensitivity of slopes and zero points to sample selection , which are considerable , but within the quoted statistical uncertainties : @xmath40.11 and @xmath40.20 , respectively for the slopes , and @xmath40.05 and @xmath40.09  mag , for the zero points .",
    "so as to make the subsequent comparisons consistent , the original sandage & tammann ( 1968 ) calibration ( st68.1 in the lower left panel ) has been placed on the modern hyades / pleiades galactic cluster distance scale by applying a single offset of + 0.13  mag derived from the average difference between the absolute magnitudes of the cepheids used in the 1968 calibration updated to feast and walker ( 1987 ) , their table 2 .",
    "this distance scale corresponds to a hyades modulus of 3.27 ( see pel 1985 ) and uses the pleiades main sequence , at a modulus of 5.57 ( van leeuwen , 1983 ) to effectively correct for the over - metallicity of the hyades with respect to the older galactic clusters in which the cepheid calibrators are found .",
    "0.06  mag for the pleiades cluster , based on hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes . following the venice meeting in june 1997",
    "the value had changed only slightly to 5.33 @xmath40.06  mag ( c. turon , private communication ) if adopted , this pleiades modulus would make the galactic - cluster - based calibrations approximately 0.3  mag fainter than the fc97 solution plotted in figure  1 . at this point in time the galactic cluster",
    "zero point appears to be in a state of flux , and we will not comment on it further , except to note that the hipparcos calibration will undoubtedly converge on a more accurate zero point than we have access to at this precise moment . ] finally , the fw87 calibration itself is plotted in the lower left panel . in all panels",
    "the dashed horizontal lines represent the fiducial hipparcos calibration flanked by thin parallel lines at @xmath6  mag .",
    "the error bars of all of the plotted previously published relations overlap with errors quoted for the hipparcos solution ( a formal uncertainty was not given by st68 , so we have arbitrarily assigned them an error of @xmath13  mag ) .",
    "however , the offsets are not randomly distributed , with each of the solutions appearing to be systematically fainter in @xmath14 with respect to the hipparcos calibration by about 0.1  mag .",
    "we discuss the significance and possible implications of this difference in the following sections .",
    "in madore & freedman ( 1991 ) we published fiducial pl relations in seven bandpasses : @xmath12 .",
    "these were all based on selecting self - consistent sets of previously published lmc cepheid data , scaled to an lmc true distance modulus of 18.50  mag and applying a single line - of - sight reddening correction using @xmath15  mag .",
    "thirty - two stars were available for a calibration of @xmath11 pl relations ; 25 stars were used for an alternative set of @xmath12 calibrations . in the following we compare those multiwavelength pl relations with the hipparcos sample of galactic cepheids , individually corrected for foreground reddening and scaled to their geometric parallax distances .",
    "we have collected from the literature multiwavelength ( @xmath0 ) mean magnitudes for as many of the hipparcos - calibrating cepheids as have been published ( notably for the infrared wisniewski & johnson 1968 , welch _ et al .",
    "_ 1984 , laney & stobie 1992 and reference therein ) .",
    "these form rather disjoint subsets . after eliminating the suspected overtone pulsators listed by fc97 , the total available sample with parallaxes drops from 26 to 20 . of these",
    "only 7 have mean magnitudes published at all six wavelengths , while 10 and 13 cepheids , respectively have either @xmath16 or @xmath17 magnitudes in common .",
    "we have analyzed these four groups of stars independently , but self - consistently , in the following way .    using the hipparcos parallaxes and galactic reddenings adopted by fc97 from fernie , kamper & seager ( 1993 ) scaled to the various wavelengths using the extinction law of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 )",
    ", we derived absolute magnitudes for each of the cepheids in each of the observed wavelengths .",
    "( we note that these corrections for interstellar extinction are not inconsiderable , ranging up to 2  mag in @xmath18 for several stars ) .",
    "the resulting pl relations are shown in the six panels of figure  2 .",
    "error bars are one - sigma uncertainties from the quoted parallaxes .",
    "note the highly correlated nature of the individual data points about the fiducial lines . and too , we remind the reader that the computation of distances and their related errors from observed parallaxes is non - trivial ( brown _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , as distances are not linearly related to parallaxes , and parallax errors can subtly bias samples .",
    "a full treatment of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper , but we note that selection biases at least are minimized for stars having the smallest reported errors . as discussed by brown _",
    "et al . _ , given the true parallax distribution the expected biases follow naturally ; however , corrections to the _ observed _ parallaxes require assumptions about the true distribution , and detailed modeling .",
    "fortunately for this application the cepheid sample is not parallax - selected ; the objects being chosen in advance based on their optical variability , periods and apparent magnitudes .",
    "the differences between these individual ( trigonometric ) absolute magnitudes and the predicted @xmath0 magnitudes derived from the mean pl relations of mf91 ( solid lines in figure  2 ) are each plotted in figure  3 against the corresponding b - band residual .",
    "the @xmath19 intrinsic color residuals are plotted against the b - band residuals in the upper right panel .",
    "the individual residuals at a given wavelength contain random contributions from the parallax uncertainties , reddening errors , and finally the intrinsic ( temperature - induced ) magnitude residuals which reflect the finite width of the cepheid instability strip .",
    "the observed residuals are however extremely large ( nearly 5  mag peak - to - peak ) and are almost certainly dominated by the ( achromatic ) errors in the parallaxes , given the strict unit - slope correlation of the mag - mag residuals , and the total lack of any correlation between the magnitude - color residuals ( figure  3 ) .",
    "wavelength - dependent offsets between the six mean solutions independently will reflect ( 1 ) errors in the adopted true distance to the lmc ( which set all of the zero points in the mf91 multiwavelength pl relation calibrations ) , ( 2 ) reddening errors in the adopted extinction to the lmc sample of calibrating cepheids , and finally ( 3 ) intrinsic differences between the lmc and galactic cepheids , for example , due to metallicity .",
    "our first solution considers the largest data set ( in terms of parallaxes ) but the one that is most restricted in terms of wavelength coverage : it consists of 19 cepheids observed in @xmath18 and @xmath14 . weighted by the square of the signal - to - noise ratio in the hipparcos parallax , the residuals were summed and averaged at each of the two wavelengths giving mean offsets between the lmc calibration and the galactic cepheids .",
    "the variance in each mean offset was then calculated from the average of the squares of these same residuals again inversely weighted by the variance in the individually quoted parallaxes .",
    "the differences are @xmath20  mag and @xmath21  mag , in the sense that the lmc cepheid calibration appears to be too faint with respect to the galactic calibration .",
    "( further restricting the sample to only those 12 stars with @xmath22 changes @xmath23 to @xmath24  mag and @xmath25 to @xmath26mag . )",
    "if the ( statistically marginal , but apparently systematic ) differences in the @xmath18 and @xmath14 solutions were to be ascribed to reddening alone , then the galactic data and the lmc calibration can be reconciled by invoking an increase of @xmath27  mag in the adopted mean reddening to the lmc cepheid sample .",
    "this is consistent with a similar suggestion regarding the lmc cepheid calibration made recently by bohm - vitense ( 1997 ) based on different data .",
    "this reddening solution has the consequence that it would also require the distance modulus of the lmc to be revised _",
    "downwards _ by 0.06  mag to 18.44  mag ; the uncertainty on this offset being at least as large as the uncertainty in the individual moduli ( @xmath28  mag ) , depending on the degree of correlation in those cumulative uncertainties .",
    "this particular path , of a reddening solution , can not be considered definitive .",
    "other possibilities are : ( 1 ) the lmc true modulus should be increased by @xmath29  mag , without any change to the foreground reddening , or ( 2 ) that there are differential metallicity corrections amounting to @xmath30 and @xmath31  mag that need to be applied at the @xmath18 and @xmath14 wavelengths , respectively .",
    "of course any suitably contrived linear combination of the above three effects could also be invoked .",
    "more constraints on the problem are obviously needed .",
    "an alternative possibility is that some of the wavelength - dependent effects seen in the comparison of galactic ( high metallicity ) data with the lmc ( lower metallicity ) data could be due to chemical composition differences between the two samples .",
    "taken at face value the dependence of the apparent @xmath14 modulus on metallicity would be very large , @xmath32   = 0.16/0.15    =   1.1   ( \\pm 1.9)$ ]  mag / dex , assuming that the full offset in @xmath14 noted in the above comparison is due to metallicity , and adopting a metallicity underabundance of 1.4@xmath33 between the lmc and the solar neighborhood ( see , for example , fw87 ) .",
    "however , we note that this effect is basically indistinguishable from reddening in its form ( as evidenced by our first set of solutions ) , and that the offset ( whatever its origin ) when treated as reddening leads to a true distance modulus for the lmc that is unchanged , from previous assumptions , at 18.50  mag . given this apparent degeneracy between reddening and metallicity , and the current large uncertainties in the parallaxes , assessing the dependence on metallicity from these data alone will remain problematic .    to obtain added leverage on the solution , moving to",
    "the infrared has numerous well known advantages , as first articulated in mcgonegal , mclaren , mcalary & madore ( 1982 ) : reddening effects are known to decrease with wavelength , in a well defined and calibrated manner ; and simultaneously , metallicity effects are also expected to decrease in amplitude with increased wavelength .",
    "our second solution is based on 13 cepheids each having @xmath34 data in common .",
    "this four - color solution gives a derived reddening _ increase _ for the lmc cepheid sample of @xmath35  mag , with no formal offset in the derived @xmath36  mag true modulus for the lmc .",
    "our next approximation employs 10 cepheids each now having @xmath16 mean magnitudes . here",
    "the formal solution for the true modulus for the lmc is @xmath37  mag , with a corresponding increase in the mean reddening of @xmath38  mag .",
    "finally , we have analyzed a sample of 7 galactic cepheids , each having @xmath0 photometry , to obtain one last solution : @xmath39  mag with @xmath40  mag .",
    "the fit to this final set of observations is shown in figure  4 ; the @xmath41 weighted residual fitting surface being shown as an inset .",
    "the individual apparent moduli discussed here , and their errors , are summarized in table 1 .    finally , if we now adopt the metallicity correction of @xmath42  mag advocated by fc97 and assume that the effects at jhk are negligible , ( and eliminate @xmath18 and @xmath43 from the solution given that metallicity corrections for these filters are not well defined at this time ) we find for this 4-color solution @xmath44  mag with @xmath45  mag .",
    "this is virtually indistinguishable from the full @xmath0 solution given above .",
    "we have used the hipparcos parallaxes of nearby galactic cepheids to explore corrections to the multiwavelength period - luminosity relations for lmc cepheids .",
    "the latter are based on an lmc data set scaled to a true distance modulus of 18.50  mag and an adopted foreground reddening of @xmath46  mag . although the current uncertainties in the parallaxes are large and still dependent upon the specific subsets of the cepheids chosen for the comparison , the agreement is good , indicating that to within @xmath40.14  mag ( or , 7% in distance ) the previously adopted zero point is substantially correct .",
    "based on different subsamples of data either having @xmath47 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 or @xmath0 photometry , lmc moduli , ranging from 18.44 to 18.57  mag are derived .",
    "these results , summarized in table 2 , differ from the value of 18.70  mag of fc97 , which are based soley on the reddening - corrected v photometry of caldwell & laney ( 1991 ) , externally adjusted for metallicity .",
    "the hipparcos data alone do not allow us to discriminate between metallicity effects and the physically distinct possibility of added reddening to the lmc .    to alleviate the ambiguity posed by the need to simultaneously solve both for reddening and metallicity effects on the cepheid distances we are currently deriving ob - star reddenings along the individual lines of sight to several dozen lmc cepheids .",
    "this will allow us to decouple the reddening determinations from metallicity effects , and go beyond the use of a single mean ( foreground @xmath48 internal ) reddening for the lmc calibrating cepheid sample .",
    "preliminary reductions indicate that the variance from field to field is large ( ranging from @xmath49 0.00 up to 0.40  mag ) while still indicating that an average value of @xmath50  mag is appropriate for the lmc calibrating cepheids .",
    "details will be presented in madore , freedman & pevunova ( 1998 in preparation ) .",
    "we close by noting that at least three other very recent determinations of the true modulus to the lmc fall on either side of the value 18.50  mag adopted by mf91 in setting a zero point for the cepheid distance scale .",
    "both reid ( 1997 ) and gratton _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) derive large lmc moduli ( 18.65 @xmath4  0.10 , and 18.63 @xmath4  0.06  mag , respectively ) using hipparcos - based calibrations of the galactic globular cluster and rr lyrae distance scale . on the other hand , gould & uza ( 1997 ) have re - analyzed the sn  1987a supernova `` light echo '' and derive _ an upper limit _ of @xmath51  18.37 @xmath52  mag for the lmc true distance modulus ; although they note that if the ring is slightly elliptical ( @xmath53 0.95 ) this upper limit increases to @xmath54  mag .",
    "a value of 18.56 @xmath4 0.05  mag has been derived by panagia _",
    "( 1996 ) from the same data . until these differences are fully understood and resolved , and given the remaining uncertainties in the hipparcos cepheid parallax data we prefer to adopt a true distance modulus of 18.50  mag for the lmc , but now bounded by an uncertainty of @xmath4  0.15  mag , defined to fully encompass the above range of recently published values .",
    "this value is consistent with other estimated distances to the lmc based on a wide variety of methods ( for a comprehensive modern review see westerlund 1997 )",
    ". viewed in that perspective the hipparcos data confirm the cepheid distance scale at better than the @xmath410% level ( 95% confidence ) .",
