    "a number of recent observational studies have revealed a new population of red , massive galaxies at redshift @xmath24 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , utilizing near - infrared ( ir ) wavelengths which are relatively less affected by dust extinction . at the same time , a number of studies focused on the assembly of stellar mass density at high redshift by comparing observational data and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these works argued that the hierarchical structure formation theory may have difficulty in accounting for sufficient early star formation .",
    "these concerns grew with the mounting evidence for high redshift galaxy formation including the discovery of extremely red objects ( eros ) at @xmath25 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , sub - millimeter galaxies at @xmath26 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath17 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and galaxies at @xmath27 , detected either by their lyman-@xmath28 emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or by their optical to near - ir colors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we now face the important question as to whether this evidence for high - redshift galaxy formation is consistent with the concordance @xmath1cdm model .",
    "the redshift range around @xmath29 is a particularly interesting epoch also for another reason .",
    "the redshift interval @xmath30 has long been known as the ` redshift desert ' @xcite for galaxy surveys , because there was no large volume limited sample of galaxies available in this regime until very recently .",
    "this is because strong emission lines from h ii regions of galaxies , such as [ o ii ] @xmath313727 , [ o iii ] @xmath32 4959 , 5007 , h@xmath28 and h@xmath33 , redshift out of optical wavelengths above 9300   .",
    "these spectral features are necessary to easily identify galaxy redshifts , allowing ground - based telescopes to benefit from the low - night sky background and high atmospheric transmission in the wavelengths range 4000  9000   .",
    "however , recently @xcite and @xcite have introduced new techniques for exploring the ` redshift desert ' , making it possible to identify a large number of galaxies efficiently with the help of a color selection criteria in the color - color plane of @xmath34 vs.  @xmath8 . in this technique ,",
    "galaxies at @xmath35 are located photometrically from the mild drop in the @xmath36 filter owing to the ly-@xmath28 forest opacity , and galaxies at @xmath37 are recognized from the lack of a break in their observed - frame optical spectra .",
    "the large sample of galaxies identified by these authors at @xmath0 makes it now possible to study galaxy formation and evolution for over 10  gyrs of cosmic time , from redshift @xmath6 to @xmath38 , without a significant gap .",
    "we note that the epoch around @xmath0 is particularly important for understanding galaxy evolution because at around this time , the number density of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) peaked ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ultra - violet ( uv ) luminosity density began its decline by about an order of magnitude from @xmath24 to @xmath38 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these recent observational studies of galaxies at @xmath0 , both in the uv and near - ir wavelengths , imply a range of novel tests for the hierarchical structure formation theory . in this study",
    ", we analyze the properties of massive galaxies at @xmath0 formed in state - of - the - art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of the @xmath1cdm model , and we compare them with observations .    in an earlier recent study @xcite , we argued that , based on two different types of hydrodynamic simulations ( eulerian tvd and sph ) and the theoretical model of @xcite ( hereafter h&s model ) , the predicted cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) density peaks at @xmath39 , with a _ higher _ stellar mass density at @xmath6 than suggested by current observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in contrast to some claims to the contrary @xcite .",
    "we also compared our results with those from the updated semi - analytic models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and found that our simulations and the h&s model predicts an earlier peak of the sfr density and a faster development of stellar mass density compared to these semi - analytic models .",
    "it is then interesting to examine what our simulations predict for the properties of massive galaxies at @xmath24 . in this paper , we analyze for this purpose the same set of hydrodynamic simulations that was used in @xcite , with a special focus on the most massive galaxies at this epoch . in section  [ sec : simulation ] , we briefly describe the simulations that we use . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] , we summarize our method for computing spectra of simulated galaxies both in the rest - frame and the observed - frame . in section  [ sec : colcol ] , we show the color - color diagrams and color - magnitude diagrams of simulated galaxies . in section  [ sec : mstar ] we discuss the stellar masses and number density of galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we then investigate the observed - frame @xmath40-band luminosity function and the rest - frame @xmath20-band luminosity function in section  [ sec : lf ] , followed by an analysis of the star formation histories in section  [ sec : sfhistory ] .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss the implications of our work in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we will discuss results from two different types of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "both approaches include `` standard '' physics such as radiative cooling / heating , star formation , and supernova ( sn ) feedback , although the details of the models and the parameter choices vary considerably .",
    "one set of simulations was performed using an eulerian approach , which employed a particle - mesh method for the gravity and the total variation diminishing ( tvd ) method @xcite for the hydrodynamics , both with a fixed mesh .",
    "the treatment of the radiative cooling and heating is described in @xcite in detail .",
    "the structure of the code is similar to that of @xcite , but the code has significantly improved over the years with additional input physics .",
    "it has been used for a variety of studies , including the evolution of the intergalactic medium @xcite , damped lyman-@xmath28 absorbers @xcite , and galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our other simulations were done using the lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique .",
    "we use an updated version of the code @xcite , which uses an ` entropy conserving ' formulation @xcite of sph to mitigate problems with energy / entropy conservation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and overcooling .",
    "the code also employed a subresolution multiphase model of the interstellar medium to describe self - regulated star formation which includes a phenomenological model for feedback by galactic winds @xcite , and the impact of a uniform ionizing radiation field @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used to study the evolution of the cosmic sfr @xcite , damped lyman-@xmath28 absorbers @xcite , lyman - break galaxies @xcite , disk formation @xcite , emission from the intergalactic medium @xcite , and the detectability of high redshift galaxies @xcite .    in both codes , at each time - step , some fraction of gas is converted into star particles in the regions that satisfy a set of star formation criteria ( e.g. significantly overdense , jeans unstable , fast cooling , converging gas flow ) . upon their creation , the star particles are tagged with physical parameters such as mass , formation time , and metallicity . after forming , they interact with dark matter and gas only gravitationally as collisionless particles .",
    "more specifically , in the tvd simulation , the star formation rate is formulated as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the star formation efficiency and @xmath43 is the star formation time - scale . in the tvd n864l22 run , @xmath44 and @xmath45 were used , where @xmath46 is the local dynamical time - scale owing to gravity . at each time - step , a part of the gas in a cell is converted to a star particle according to equation  ( [ eq : tvd ] ) , provided the gas is ( a ) moderately overdense ( @xmath47 ) , ( b ) jeans unstable ( @xmath48 ) , ( c ) cooling fast ( @xmath49 ) , and ( d ) the flow is converging into the cell ( @xmath50 )",
    ".    on the other hand , the sph simulations analyzed in this study parameterized the star formation rate as @xmath51 where @xmath33 is the mass fraction of short - lived stars that instantly die as supernovae ( taken to be @xmath52 ) .",
    "the star formation time - scale @xmath43 is again taken to be proportional to the local dynamical time of the gas : @xmath53 , where the value of @xmath54 is chosen to match the @xcite law . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "this parameter simultaneously determines a threshold density @xmath55 , above which a multiphase structure of the gas , and hence star formation , is allowed to develop .",
    "this physical density is @xmath56 for the simulations in this study , corresponding to a comoving baryonic overdensity of @xmath57 at @xmath38 .",
    "( see * ? ? ? * for a description of how @xmath55 is determined self - consistently within the model . )",
    "note that the density @xmath58 that determines the star formation rate in equation  ( [ eq : sph ] ) is actually the average density of cold clouds determined by a simplified equilibrium model of a multiphase interstellar medium , rather than the total gas density .",
    "however , in star - forming regions , the density is so high that the mean density in cold gas always dominates , being close to the total gas density .",
    "we will further discuss the differences between our star formation recipes in the two codes in some more detail in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted in the simulations are intended to be consistent with recent observational determinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as summarized in table  [ table : simulation ] where we list the most important numerical parameters of our primary runs .",
    "while there are many similarities in the physical treatment between the two approaches ( mesh tvd and sph ) , we see that the tvd simulation has somewhat higher mass resolution , and the sph somewhat higher spatial resolution . in that sense , the two approaches are complementary and results found in common are expected to be robust .",
    "we begin our analysis by identifying galaxies in the simulations as groups of star particles .",
    "since the two simulations use inherently different methods for solving hydrodynamics , we employ slightly different methods for locating galaxies in the two types of simulations , each developed to suit the particular simulation method well .",
    "because the stellar groups of individual galaxies are typically isolated , there is little ambiguity in their identification , such that systematic differences owing to group finding methods are largely negligible .    for the tvd simulation",
    ", we use a version of the algorithm hop @xcite to identify groups of star particles .",
    "this grouping method consists of two discrete steps : in the first step , the code computes the overdensity at the location of each particle , and in a second step , it then merges identified density peaks based on a set of overdensity threshold parameters specified by the user .",
    "there are three threshold parameters : a peak overdensity @xmath59 above which the density peak is identified as a candidate galaxy , an outer overdensity @xmath60 which defines the outer contour of groups , and finally a saddle point overdensity @xmath61 which determines whether two density peaks within the outer density contour should be merged .",
    "@xcite suggest using @xmath62 for identifying dark matter halos in n - body simulations .",
    "we applied the algorithm to the star particles in our simulation using various combinations of these parameters , and found that the results do not depend very much on the detailed choice .",
    "this reflects the higher concentration and isolation of star particle groups as compared to the dark matter , making group finding typically straightforward .",
    "however , the stellar peak overdensities relative to the mean are so high that the saddle - overdensity parameter in hop is unimportant , and the small galaxies associated with a large central galaxy at the center of a large dark matter halo are often not well separated by this algorithm .",
    "therefore , we decided not to apply the second step of the algorithm . instead , we merge two density peaks identified by the first step only if they are within two neighboring cells . by visually inspecting the particle distribution of very massive dark matter halos , we found that this method succeeds in separating some of the small galaxies embedded in a large dark matter halo especially at the outskirts of the halo , and helps to somewhat mitigate the ` overmerging problem ' in high density regions .",
    "however , even with this revised method , the central massive galaxy remains afterwards , and the addition of a small number of galaxies to the faint - end of the luminosity function does not change the qualitative feature of our results . clearly more work is needed to improve this situation on the grouping in the future , for example , using an improved grouping method such as voboz @xcite .    for the sph simulations , we employ the same method as in @xcite , where we identified isolated groups of star particles using a simplified variant of the subfind algorithm proposed by @xcite .",
    "in short , we first compute an adaptively smoothed baryonic density field for all star and gas particles .",
    "this allows us to robustly identify centers of individual galaxies as isolated density peaks .",
    "we then find the full extent of these galaxies by processing the gas and star particles in order of declining density , adding particles one by one to the galaxies .",
    "if all of the 32 nearest neighbors of a particle have lower density , this particle is considered to be a new galaxy ` seed ' .",
    "otherwise , the particle is attached to the galaxy that its nearest denser neighbor already belongs to .",
    "if the two nearest denser neighbors belong to different galaxies , and one of these galaxies has less than 32 particles , these galaxies are merged .",
    "if the two nearest denser neighbors belong to different galaxies and both of these galaxies have more than 32 particles , then the particle is attached to the larger group of the two , leaving the other one intact .",
    "finally , we restrict the set of gas particles processed in this way to those particles which have at least a density of @xmath63 times the threshold density for star formation , i.e. @xmath64 ( see * ? ? ? * for details on how the star formation threshold is determined ) .",
    "note that we are here not interested in the gaseous components of galaxies  we only include gas particles because they make the method more robust owing to the improved sampling of the baryonic density field .",
    "we found that the above method robustly links star particles that belong to the same isolated galaxy in sph simulations .",
    "a simpler friends - of - friends algorithm with a small linking length can achieve a similar result , but the particular choice one needs to make for the linking length in this method represents a problematic compromise , either leading to artificial merging of galaxies if it is too large , or to loss of star particles that went astray from the dense galactic core , if it is too small .",
    "note that , unlike in the detection of dark matter substructures , no gravitational unbinding algorithm is needed to define the groups of stars that make up the galaxies formed in the simulations .",
    "we consider only galaxies with at least 32 particles ( star and gas particles combined ) in our subsequent analysis .    for both simulations , each star particle is tagged with its mass , formation time , and metallicity of the gas particle that it was spawned from .",
    "based on these three tags , we compute the emission from each star particle , and co - add the flux from all particles for a given galaxy to obtain the spectrum of the simulated galaxy .",
    "we use the population synthesis model by @xcite which assumes a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) within a mass range of @xmath65\\,{{\\rm m}_{\\odot}}$ ] , as recommended by @xcite .",
    "spectral properties obtained with this imf are very similar to those obtained using the @xcite imf , but the @xcite imf provides a better fit to counts of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "we use the high resolution version of the spectral library of @xcite which contains 221 spectra describing the spectral evolution of a simple stellar population from @xmath66 to @xmath67  gyr over 6900 wavelength points in the range of 91",
    "- 160  @xmath68 m .",
    "once the intrinsic spectrum is computed , we apply the @xcite extinction law with three different values of @xmath69 in order to investigate the impact of extinction .",
    "these values span the range of extinction estimated from observations of lbgs at @xmath6 @xcite . using the spectra computed in this manner ,",
    "we then derive rest - frame colors and luminosity functions of the simulated galaxies .    to obtain the spectra in the observed frame , we redshift the spectra and apply absorption by the intergalactic medium ( igm ) following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "once the redshifted spectra in the observed frame are obtained , we convolve them with different filter functions , including @xmath2 @xcite and standard johnson bands , and compute the magnitudes in both ab and vega systems .",
    "apparent @xmath36 , @xmath70 , @xmath40 magnitudes are computed in the ab system to compare our results with @xcite and @xcite , while the rest - frame v - band magnitude is computed in the vega system .",
    "in figure  [ colcol.eps ] , we show the color - color diagrams of simulated galaxies at @xmath0 in the observed - frame @xmath71 vs.  @xmath8 plane , for both sph ( top 2 panels ) and tvd ( bottom right panel ) simulations .",
    "only galaxies brighter than @xmath72 are shown in order to match the magnitude limit of the sample of @xcite .",
    "we plot different symbols for three different values of calzetti extinction : @xmath73 ( blue dots ) , 0.15 ( green crosses ) , and 0.3 ( red open squares ) . as the level of extinction by dust",
    "is increased from @xmath73 to 0.3 , the measured points move towards the upper right corner of each panel .",
    "this behavior is expected for a conventional star - forming galaxy spectrum , as demonstrated in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "the color - selection criteria used by @xcite and @xcite is shown by the long - dashed boxes .",
    "the upper ( lower ) box corresponds to their bx ( bm ) criteria for selecting galaxies at @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the number density of all the galaxies shown ( i.e. @xmath4 ) is given in each panel for @xmath73 , 0.15 , 0.30 from top to bottom , respectively .",
    "it is encouraging to see that in all the panels most of the simulated galaxies actually satisfy the observational color selection criteria for the case of @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that the simulated galaxies have realistic uv colors compared to the observed ones .",
    "simulated galaxies with no extinction tend to be too blue compared to the color - selection criteria . in the sph g6 run , the distribution is wider than in the sph d5 and tvd n864l22 runs , owing to the larger number of galaxies in a larger simulation box , and the distribution actually extends beyond the color selection boundaries .",
    "the spatial number density of galaxies with @xmath4 is about @xmath76 for the sph g6 run .",
    "we will discuss the number density of galaxies with various cuts in figure  [ nden.eps ] in more detail .",
    "we repeated the same calculation with the sloan digital sky survey s @xmath77 filter set , and found that the distribution of points hardly changes , even when we exchange @xmath78 with @xmath79 , and @xmath8 with @xmath80 .",
    "this means that searches for galaxies in the redshift range @xmath30 can also substitute the sloan filters @xmath81 when applying a color - selection following the ` bx ' and ` bm ' criteria adopted by @xcite and @xcite .    in figure",

    ", we use three different symbols for three different values of extinction : @xmath73 ( blue dots ) , 0.15 ( green crosses ) , and 0.3 ( red open squares ) .",
    "the vertical long - dashed line and the arrow indicate the magnitude limit of @xmath72 used by @xcite .",
    "the horizontal line at @xmath82 corresponds to the upper limit of the color - selection box of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we see that most of the galaxies brighter than @xmath72 automatically satisfy the criterion @xmath83 , and almost no galaxies with @xmath4 fall out of the region for @xmath3 .",
    "there is a significant population of dim ( @xmath84 ) galaxies with @xmath85 .",
    "we will see below that these are low - mass galaxies with stellar masses @xmath86 .",
    "we will discuss the amount of stellar mass contained in the galaxies that satisfy the color selection criteria in section  [ sec : mstar ] .",
    "in figure  [ rmag_mstar.eps ] , we show the apparent @xmath87 magnitude vs.  stellar mass of simulated galaxies at redshift @xmath0 , for both sph ( top 2 panels ) and tvd ( bottom right panel ) simulations .",
    "the three different symbols correspond to three different values of extinction : @xmath73 ( blue dots ) , 0.15 ( green crosses ) , and 0.3 ( red open squares ) . the vertical long - dashed line and the arrow indicate the magnitude limit of @xmath72 used by @xcite .    from this figure , we see that there are many galaxies with stellar masses larger than @xmath88 and @xmath4 at @xmath0 in our simulations . in the sph g6 run ,",
    "the masses of the most luminous galaxies are substantially larger than those in the d5 run .",
    "but this is primarily a result of a finite box size effect ; the brightest galaxies have a very low space - density , and so they are simply not found in simulations with too small a volume . in the sph g6 run ,",
    "the most massive galaxies at @xmath0 have masses @xmath89 with a number density of @xmath90 .",
    "such galaxies are hence not commonly found in a comoving box - size of @xmath91 , in fact , only one such galaxy exists in the d5 run .",
    "cosmic variance hence significantly affects the resulting number density , and one ideally needs a simulation box larger than @xmath92 to obtain a reliable estimate of the number density of such massive galaxies .",
    "we note however that a couple of such massive galaxies are also found in the tvd n864l22 run , which is presumably in part a result of overmerging owing to the relatively large cell size compared to the gravitational softening length of the d5 run .    in figure  [ nden.eps ] ,",
    "we summarize the results on the cumulative number densities of galaxies , either measured above a certain threshold value of stellar mass [ panel ( a ) ] , or below a threshold value of observed - frame @xmath40-band magnitude [ panel ( b ) ] , or rest - frame @xmath20-band magnitude [ panel ( c ) ] . in panel ( a ) , we see that the results of different runs agree reasonably well in the threshold mass range of @xmath93 , but differ somewhat at the lower and higher mass thresholds . at the low - mass end , the lower resolution of the g6 run results in a lower number density than in the d5 run . at the high - mass end",
    ", the smaller box - size limits the number density in the d5 run compared to the higher value in the g6 run .",
    "the result of the tvd run falls in between those of d5 and g6 at the low - mass end , but gives larger values relative to the sph runs at the high - mass end , probably owing to the overmerging problem .",
    "a similar level of agreement can be seen in panel ( c ) , where the rest - frame magnitude is used for the @xmath94-axis , but in panel ( b ) , comparatively large differences are present partly owing to the larger stretch in the abscissa .",
    "we find that the amount of stellar mass contained in the galaxies that satisfy the color - selection criteria is in general far from being close to the total stellar mass .",
    "owing to the limited box - size and resolution effects , it is somewhat difficult to obtain an accurate estimate of the mass fraction above some magnitude limit . however , we list the stellar mass fractions as a reference for future work . in the g6 run , which has comparatively low mass resolution , the stellar mass fraction contained in galaxies that pass the criteria ( i.e. @xmath4 & color - selection ) account for only ( 60 , 65 , 42)% of all the stars , for extinctions of @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "these fractions are relatively large compared to other runs , because , as we will see in section  [ sec : lf ] , the luminosity function in the g6 run starts to fall short of galaxies near @xmath96 compared to the d5 run owing to its limited resolution , and the g6 run lacks low - mass faint galaxies with @xmath19 . on the other hand , in the d5 run , the stellar mass fraction contained in galaxies that pass the criteria ( i.e. @xmath4 & color - selection ) account for only ( 32 , 17 , 2)% , and ( 16 , 13 , 1)% of the stars in the tvd n864l22 run , for extinctions of @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "these fractions are smaller compared to those of the g6 run , because the d5 and tvd n864l22 runs lack massive bright galaxies owing to their smaller box sizes .",
    "if we relax the criteria from ` @xmath4 & color - selection ' to only @xmath4 , then the corresponding stellar mass fractions increase to ( 75 , 65 , 44)% for g6 , ( 32 , 17 , 3)% for d5 , and ( 46 , 34 , 29)% for tvd n864l22 . in summary , we expect that the true stellar mass fraction that satisfies the criteria lies somewhere between the results of g6 and d5 ( and tvd n864l22 ) runs , which should be roughly @xmath97 .",
    "this implies that the current surveys with a magnitude limit of @xmath96 at best account for half of the stellar mass in the universe .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion based on different theoretical arguments that compared the results of our hydrodynamic simulations and the theoretical model of @xcite with near - ir observations of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "rather , the bluest galaxies with colors @xmath100 are galaxies with somewhat lower mass in the range @xmath101 . the most massive galaxies with @xmath102 have slightly redder colors of @xmath103 owing to their underlying old stellar population .    in the tvd simulation",

    ", we show the rest - frame @xmath20-band luminosity function of all simulated galaxies at @xmath0 for both sph ( top 2 panels ) and tvd ( bottom left panel ) simulations . in these three panels , blue long - dashed , green solid , and red dot - short - dashed lines correspond to extinctions of @xmath73 , 0.15 , 0.30 , respectively . in the bottom right panel ,",
    "the combined result is shown with the sph d5 ( green solid line ) , g6 ( red long - dashed ) , and tvd ( blue dot - dashed ) runs overplotted for the case of @xmath3 . for reference , the magnitude limit of @xmath114 ( for @xmath115 ) for the survey of @xmath6 lbgs by @xcite",
    "is indicated by the vertical dotted line and the arrow . for comparison ,",
    "we also include schechter function fits with parameters ( @xmath116 as short - dashed curves in all panels .",
    "these schechter parameters are the same as the ones that @xcite fitted to their observational data , except that the characteristic magnitude @xmath117 is 0.5 magnitudes brighter . the same amount of brightening is seen in the g6 run from @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "5 of @xcite has to be added to obtain correct ab magnitudes",
    ". the corrected version of the paper will be posted at astro - ph/0311295 .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath20-band results were not affected by this error . ] ) to @xmath0 .",
    "so the g6 run with @xmath3 describes the bright - end of the luminosity function at @xmath0 and @xmath6 quite well . in the bottom left panel for the tvd run , another schechter function with a much shallower faint - end slope and parameters @xmath118",
    "is also shown with a magenta long - dash - short - dashed line for comparison .",
    "one can see that the tvd run contains more fainter galaxies with @xmath119 than the sph runs .",
    "this could be due to the higher baryonic mass resolution and the additional small - scale power in the tvd run compared with the sph runs as we will discuss more in section  [ sec : sfhistory ] .",
    "we can compute the expected characteristic magnitude @xmath120 of @xmath0 galaxies from the observational estimate of @xmath120 at @xmath6 .",
    "the difference in the luminosity distance between @xmath6 and @xmath0 corresponds to about one magnitude for our adopted cosmology , and we saw in the previous paragraph that the rest - frame @xmath20-band luminosity function brightened by @xmath121 magnitude from @xmath6 to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we expect that @xmath120 should be brighter by about 1.5 magnitudes at @xmath0 compared to @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath122 for the observed - frame @xmath40-band luminosity function of the @xmath6 galaxies .",
    "therefore we obtain @xmath123 as the expected value for the @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the result of the sph g6 run shown in fig .",
    "[ lf_r.eps ] is reasonably close to this expected value .",
    "it is also clear that the box size of the d5 and tvd runs are too small to reliably sample the brightest galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "this is also seen in fig .",
    "[ lf_v.eps ] as a lack of brightest galaxies at @xmath124 in the d5 and tvd runs .",
    "this is because the brightest galaxies form in rare high density peaks which are at the knots of the large - scale filaments , and one needs a sufficiently large volume to sample a fair number of such bright galaxies reliably . since the comoving correlation length of lbgs at @xmath6 are @xmath125 @xcite , one needs a box size larger than at least @xmath126 in order to have a fair sample of lbgs at @xmath6 .",
    "the simulated volume of the g6 run is @xmath127 comoving , and one of the face of the simulation box corresponds to 2.5 @xmath128 at @xmath6 .",
    "the coverage area of the lbg survey of @xcite at @xmath6 is about 0.4 @xmath128 , and the depth of their survey is @xmath129 which corresponds to @xmath130 comoving for our adopted flat-@xmath1 cosmology .",

    "panels @xmath131 & @xmath132 show results for the two most massive galaxies in each simulation box , while panels @xmath133 & @xmath134 are for the two reddest galaxies among those with @xmath16 . in the right side of each panel ,",

    "the cumulative star formation history of the galaxies in panels @xmath137 is shown .",
    "the results of the sph d5 and g6 runs ( fig .",
    "[ sfhist_d5.eps ] & [ sfhist_g6.eps ] ) suggest that the most massive galaxies have almost continuously formed stars with a rate exceeding @xmath10 over a few gyrs from @xmath11 to @xmath0 ( note that @xmath138 ) .",
    "half of their stellar mass was already assembled by @xmath139 .",

    "the tvd simulation ( fig .  [ sfhist_tvd.eps ] ) on the other hand suggests a more sporadic star formation history than the sph simulations , and the two most massive galaxies in the simulation box experienced massive star formation between @xmath6 and @xmath0 that exceeded @xmath141 for brief periods .",
    "the peak star formation rate of the most massive galaxy in the g6 run also reaches @xmath141 occasionally . in the real universe",
    ", such violent starburst activity is found in high - redshift quasars and submm sources where the existence of dense , warm , and massive molecular clouds of @xmath142 is inferred from the observed rotational emission line of co ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the number density of quasar host galaxies with such a violent star formation activity is not well - constrained yet , but it probably is not very large because the space density of quasars with @xmath143 is smaller than @xmath144 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the space density of submm sources is also similar : @xmath145 at @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "these values are much smaller than the space density of lyman break galaxies @xmath146 @xcite . finding 3 such massive starbursts at @xmath0 in our tvd simulation box of @xmath147 results in a number density of @xmath148 , which may be too high compared to the observed value .",
    "it is also possible that the two galaxies shown in figure  [ sfhist_tvd.eps ] are affected by the overmerging problem which tends to merge galaxies in very high density regions owing to a lack of spatial resolution .",
    "if these two massive galaxies were broken up into several less massive galaxies , then the @xmath141 of star formation would be distributed to a few hundreds @xmath149 for each galaxy .",
    "the two reddest massive galaxies in the tvd run ( fig .",
    "[ sfhist_tvd.eps]c & [ sfhist_tvd.eps]d ) have cumulative star formation histories which are similar to those of the sph runs , with half of their stellar mass already assembled by @xmath12 .",
    "they have completed their star formation by @xmath17 and have been quiet from @xmath6 to @xmath0 . because they are dominated by an old stellar population , they have very red colors of @xmath104 and show up in the upper right corner of the tvd ( bottom right ) panel in fig .  [ colcol.eps ] .",
    "another way of looking at the star formation history of galaxies is to look at the distribution of formation times of stellar particles in the simulation for a given set of galaxies as a whole ; i.e. we here analyze the combined star formation history for a particular class of galaxies divided by their stellar mass . in figure",
    "[ age_dist.eps ] , we show the mass - weighted probability distribution of stellar masses as a function of formation time ( @xmath150 corresponds to the big bang ) , for different samples of galaxies . to this end , we have split the total galaxy sample into 3 categories by stellar mass at @xmath0 : @xmath16 ( top panel ) , @xmath151 ( middle panel ) , and @xmath152 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "different line types correspond to different simulations : red long - dashed ( sph g6 run ) , blue solid ( sph d5 run ) , and black dot - dashed ( tvd n864l22 run ) .",
    "the vertical dotted lines indicate four different epochs , namely @xmath0 , 3 , 4 , & 5 , as indicated in the top panel .    in the two top panels for massive galaxies",
    ", the distribution roughly agrees between the different runs , except for the large bump in the tvd run close to @xmath0 , which is caused by starbursts in a few massive galaxies .",
    "also note that the distribution of g6 run is slightly more bumpy owing to lack of mass resolution compared to other runs .    in the bottom panel for the less massive galaxies ,",
    "the distribution is very different between the 3 runs . in the tvd run ,",
    "the bulk of stars in low - mass galaxies forms before @xmath139 , whereas the opposite is true for the sph g6 run .",
    "these low - mass galaxies that formed very early on appeared as a strong concentration of points at @xmath153 in fig .",
    "[ mstar_col.eps ] for the tvd n864l22 run .",
    "the result for the sph d5 appears to be intermediate between the two .",
    "this could perhaps be caused by the additional small - scale power in the tvd run compared with the sph runs .",
    "the initial mean inter - particle separations of both dark matter and gas particles in the two sph runs are comoving 104 and @xmath154 for the d5 and g6 run , respectively , but the mean inter - particle separation of dark matter particles in the tvd run is comoving @xmath155 , with a baryonic cell size of @xmath156 . therefore , at very early times , the tvd run should be able to resolve smaller matter fluctuations than the two sph runs .",
    "such an effect could explain the earlier formation epoch of low - mass galaxies in the tvd run compared to the two sph runs , provided it is not compensated by the comparatively lower gravitational force resolution ( roughly 2 cells ) of the tvd particle - mesh method .",
    "we have used two different types of hydrodynamic cosmological simulations ( eulerian tvd and sph ) to study the properties of massive galaxies at @xmath0 in a @xmath1cdm universe , with particular emphasis on an observationally inspired selection based on the @xmath2 filter set .",
    "the simulated galaxies at @xmath0 satisfy well the color - selection criteria proposed by @xcite and @xcite when we assume @xcite extinction with @xmath3 .",
    "however , we find that the fraction of stellar mass contained in galaxies that pass the color - selection criteria could be as low as 50% of the total .",
    "the number density of simulated galaxies brighter than @xmath4 at @xmath0 is about @xmath157 for @xmath3 in the most representative run ( sph g6 run ) , roughly one order of magnitude larger than that of lyman break galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "the increase of the number density of bright galaxies can be viewed as a consequence of the ongoing hierarchical build - up of larger and brighter galaxies with ever more stellar mass .",
    "the most massive galaxies at @xmath0 have stellar masses of @xmath7 , and their observed - frame @xmath8 colors lie in the range @xmath9 provided that the median extinction is @xmath158 .",
    "they have been continuously forming stars with a rate exceeding @xmath10 over a few gyrs from @xmath11 to @xmath0 .",
    "typically , half of their stellar mass was already assembled by @xmath12 . the bluest galaxies with @xmath13 at @xmath0 are somewhat less massive , with @xmath14 , and are less dominated by old stellar populations .",
    "our study suggests that the majority of the most massive galaxies at @xmath0 could be detected at rest - frame uv wavelengths contrary to some recent claims based on near - ir studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of galaxies at the same epoch , provided the median extinction is in the range @xmath18 as indicated by the surveys of lyman break galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "we plan to extend our analysis to the near - ir pass - bands in subsequent work .",
    "we find that these massive galaxies reside in the highest overdensity regions in the simulations at @xmath0 .",
    "while it is encouraging to see that the two very different types of hydrodynamic simulation methods give a similar picture for the overall properties of massive galaxies at @xmath0 , we have also seen some notable differences in the results of the sph and tvd simulations throughout the paper .",
    "for example , the star formation history of galaxies in the tvd simulation is clearly more sporadic or ` bursty ' than that in the sph simulations .",
    "this probably owes to the differences in resolution and the details of how star formation is modeled in the two codes , as we described in section  [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "while the dependence of the star formation rate on local gas density is essentially the same for the tvd and sph simulations , the different numerical coefficients effectively multiplying the local density on the right hand sides of equations ( [ eq : tvd ] ) and ( [ eq : sph ] ) produce different temporal smoothing of the local star formation rates and the parameters adopted by the tvd code leads to a more `` bursty '' output ( @xmath159 ) , although not to a significantly different total star formation rate . at this point",
    "we simply must await a more detailed theory or be guided by observations in choosing between the two approaches .",
    "another difference we saw is that the faint - end slope of the rest - frame @xmath20-band luminosity function : the tvd simulation gives @xmath160 , similar to what is observed locally @xmath161 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the sph d5 and g6 runs give much steeper slope of @xmath162 .",
    "the question of the nature of the faint - end slope of the luminosity function is one that we have not resolved at this point .",
    "the difference may owe to the difference in the treatment of feedback , but @xcite found a flat faint - end slope of @xmath161 in a high - resolution softened lagrangian hydrodynamic ( slh ) simulation @xcite even when the code did not include sn feedback , suggesting that the photoionization of the gas in low - mass halos by the uv background radiation field is responsible for suppressing the formation of low - mass galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the theoretical expectation is not fully clear at present , and it will be very interesting to see what is indicated by upcoming observational programs of deeper high redshift galaxies and future theoretical studies .",
    "the present study shows that despite a considerably different numerical methodology and large differences in the assumed model for star formation , two independent hydrodynamic codes predict the formation of rather massive galaxies at @xmath163 in the @xmath164cdm cosmology , with properties that are broadly consistent with current observations .",
    "the results do not suggest that hierarchical galaxy formation fails to be able to account for these objects . on the contrary",
    ", it predicts that significant additional mass in galaxies will be found as the observational selection criteria are broadened .",
