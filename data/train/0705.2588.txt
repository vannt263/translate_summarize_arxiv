    "the distribution function of cosmic - ray protons @xmath25 depends on the injection power , spectrum , and spatial distribution of cosmic rays . by specifying these ingredients",

    "the cosmic - ray pressure @xmath27 and energy density @xmath28 , which are the quantities that we want to constrain , are directly related to the injection power of the cosmic rays .",
    "the cosmic - ray spectrum is measured to be a power law with the index of @xmath29 in our galaxy , but in the clusters it is perhaps harder , since they can confine cosmic rays for cosmological times @xcite .",
    "we thus adopt harder spectrum with @xmath30 and 2.4 , but also use @xmath31 as a limiting case .",
    "it is also possible that the injection of the cosmic rays and thus their energy density @xmath28 are intermittent .",
    "although it is interesting to constrain the source property by measuring such @xmath0-ray variability , this is not the primary focus in the present paper .",
    "instead , we concentrate on constraining energy density @xmath28 averaged over _ glast _ exposure time . for the sensitivity of _ glast _ , we consider the result of one - year all - sky survey , which corresponds to @xmath370-day exposure to each source as the field of view is @xmath320% of the whole sky .",
    "therefore , any time variability within this 70-day duration is smeared out .",
    "we define quantities @xmath32 and @xmath33 as ratios of energy density and pressure of cosmic rays to those of thermal gas , respectively , i.e. , @xmath34 in general , these depend on the radius , but the concrete dependence is totally unknown . various mechanisms supplying the cosmic - ray protons have been proposed , which produce characteristic and diverse profiles of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "we note that this approach ignores boosts in @xmath0-ray flux caused by clumpiness .",
    "the constraints derived using a smooth model hence provide a conservative upper limit on @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we first focus on @xmath32 , and later discuss @xmath33 . the relation between @xmath0-ray intensity and @xmath32",
    "is summarized in appendix  [ app : pion ] and that between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is discussed in section  [ sub : cluster mass measurements ] .",
    "we shall study the dependence of results on @xmath46 , for which we adopt 1 , 0 , and @xmath47 .",
    "below , we outline several models that motivate these values of @xmath46 .",
    "the simplest model is based on the assumption of @xmath48 , i.e. , the energy density of cosmic rays precisely traces that of thermal gas everywhere in the cluster .",
    "the latter is proportional to temperature times number density of the thermal gas , both of which are very well measured with x - rays for various nearby clusters .",
    "the gas density profile is nearly constant within a characteristic core radius @xmath49 , beyond which it decreases as a power law , while temperature profile is almost constant .",

    "* for a more comprehensive list ) .",
    "the latter two clusters have an even smaller ` cool core ' , but this structure gives only a minor effect on the @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "the formation of galaxy clusters is due to merging or accretion of smaller objects .",
    "when this occurs , the shock waves are generated at the outskirts of the clusters , somewhere around @xmath33 mpc from the center , where protons and electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unlike electrons that immediately lose energies through synchrotron radiation and inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering off cmb photons , protons are hard to lose energies , and they are transported efficiently into the cluster center following the motion of icm gas @xcite . in order to predict the eventual profile of the cosmic - ray energy density , one needs to resort to numerical simulations .",
    "the recent radiative simulations by @xcite show somewhat jagged shape for the @xmath56 profile , which implies large clumping factor . here",
    ", we model its global structure with a smooth profile with @xmath57 , ignoring the effects of clumpiness .",
    "on the other hand , they also performed nonradiative simulations which rather imply @xmath58 profile .",
    "although the latter may not be realistic , the effects of cooling and heating in clusters are also somewhat uncertain .",

    ", clusters would be bright with this mechanism during only a limited period after injection .",
    "for example , the radiative cooling time scale for 10 gev electrons is @xmath310@xmath188 years , which is much shorter than typical cluster age . by the same reason and also comparing the spatial intensity distribution , it is unlikely that synchrotron radiation from these primary electrons is responsible for the observed radio halo emissions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it might still be possible to overcome these difficulties if these electrons are continuously reaccelerated in situ through the second order fermi mechanism @xcite . in this case , however , the spectrum of electrons has typically a cutoff at the lorentz factor of @xmath189 .",
    "this property , while explains spectrum of radio halo of coma quite well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , would restrict the @xmath0-ray flux in the gev region due to the ic scattering and bremsstrahlung . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , we show the upper bound on these components in the case of coma cluster as a dotted curve , taken from @xcite .    in consequence , as long as @xmath32 is more than a few per cent , it would be unlikely that the primary electrons , whether they are directly injected or continuously reaccelerated , dominate the gev @xmath0-ray flux , at least in a large fraction of clusters .",
    "even though primary electron component dominated the detected flux , the shape of @xmath0-ray spectrum would be very different from @xmath15-decay component especially at low energies , which could be used as a diagnosis tool ; this difference comes from the kinematics of @xmath15 decays .",
    "the _ glast _ energy band ranges down to @xmath320 mev , which is especially important characteristic for that purpose .",
    "moreover , observations in lower frequency bands such as radio , euv , and hard x - rays , are also important , because these emissions are understood as synchrotron radiation ( for radio ) and ic scattering ( for euv and hard x - rays ) from nonthermal electrons .      if protons are accelerated up to ultra - high energies such as @xmath190 ev in galaxy clusters , which may be plausible , these protons are able to produce e@xmath167 pairs through the bethe - heitler process with cmb photons : @xmath191 .",
    "these high - energy e@xmath167 pairs then ic scatter the cmb photons , producing gev  tev @xmath0-rays @xcite . in this case , the ic photons might dominate the @xmath15-decay @xmath0-rays by many orders .",
    "however , this mechanism is extremely uncertain , depending heavily on the maximal acceleration energy of the protons .",
    "this is especially because the threshold energy of the bethe - heitler process is @xmath310@xmath19210@xmath193 ev , and it is unclear whether the magnetic fields are strong enough to confine these ultra - high energy protons for cluster ages .",
    "even if the detected @xmath0-rays are dominated by this mechanism , the spectrum would be quite different from the @xmath15-decay @xmath0-rays and should be easily distinguishable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we investigated the capability of the current and future @xmath0-ray detectors such as _ glast _ and iacts for constraining the cosmic - ray pressure contribution to the icm .    1 .",
    "we showed that the upcoming _ glast _ measurements can be used to place stringent upper limits , 0.55% , on the ratio of energy densities of the cosmic rays and thermal gas , @xmath32 , for several nearby rich clusters .",
    "these limits are fairly insensitive to the assumed energy spectrum or the radial distribution of the cosmic - ray protons for a reasonable range of models .",
    "we showed that iact sensitivity to @xmath32 is not as stringent as _ glast _ , but iacts provide useful constraint on spectral index @xmath151 , which in turn provide important constraints on the acceleration mechanisms of cosmic rays .",

    "that reproduce observed cluster properties , we showed that one - year all - sky survey with _",
    "glast _ can place tight limits ( @xmath194 ) on the evolution of mean cosmic - ray pressure in clusters out to fairly high redshift ( @xmath2 ) by stacking signals from a large sample of known clusters .",
    "these constraints will correspond to an _ upper _ limit on the systematic uncertainties in the x - ray and sze cluster mass estimates , due to nonthermal pressure provided by cosmic rays .",
    "in addition , since the halo merger rate is expected to increase with redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and such mergers can boost @xmath0-ray signals @xcite , the technique may provide insights into the relation between cosmic - ray energy density and merger activities .",
    "the same approach will also enable one to probe cosmic - ray populations in low - mass clusters .",
    "we also evaluated the cluster contribution to the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background using the latest models , and showed that even with @xmath133 , the contribution is only about 4% of the measured flux .",
    "this indicates that this approach would not currently be very helpful to constrain @xmath32 , but might become more useful in the future if a significant fraction of the background flux were resolved .",
    "we showed that @xmath0-rays due to ic scattering by both the primary and secondary electrons are likely sub - dominant relative to the @xmath0-rays from @xmath15 decays in most of the clusters .",
    "we find that the fractional contribution of the ic flux by secondary electrons never exceeds @xmath320% for a reasonable range of parameters , independently of @xmath32 .",
    "the contribution from the primary electrons will also be suppressed in many clusters , because either they cool very fast after injection or they can not be accelerated up to very high energies in the reacceleration models .",
    "moreover , multi - wavelength observations in radio , euv , and hard x - ray wavebands will provide independent constraints on nonthermal electrons in clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and such a consideration shows that the expected @xmath0-ray flux from the primary electrons is indeed sub - dominant as long as @xmath195 ( fig .",
