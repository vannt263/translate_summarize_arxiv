    "in order to improve the modeling of the solar photosphere , as well as to model atmospheres of other similar and cooler stars where the main constituent is hydrogen too , it is necessary to take into account the influence of all the relevant collisional processes on the excited - atom populations in weakly ionized hydrogen plasmas .",
    "this is important for modeling since a strong connection between the changes in atom excited - state populations and the electron density exists in weakly ionized plasmas .",
    "for example , with an increase of the electron density , caused by a growth of the excited hydrogen atom population , the rate of thermalization by electron - atom collisions in the stellar atmosphere will become higher .",
    "a consequence will be that the radiative source function of the line center will be more closely coupled to the planck function , making the synthesized spectral lines stronger for a given model structure , affecting the accuracy of plasma diagnostics and determination of the atmospheric pressure .",
    "therefore , in previous papers @xcite , just a group of chemi - ionization and chemi - recombination atom collisional processes in weakly ionized layers of stellar atmospheres ( ionization degree less than @xmath1 ) was studied . in order to demonstrate the significance of these processes it was necessary to compare their efficiency , from the aspect of their influence on the free electron and excited atom populations , with the efficiency of the known concurrent processes of electron - atom impact ionization , electron - electron - ion recombination , and electron - ion photo - recombination . in the helium case , considered in @xcite , it was established that the efficiency of chemi - ionization and chemi - recombination processes in weakly ionized layers of the examined db white dwarf atmospheres was significantly greater than the efficiency of the relevant electron - atom and electron - ion processes or at least comparable to them . in the hydrogen case , considered in @xcite in connection with solar and m red dwarf atmospheres ,",
    "the relevant chemi - ionization processes are @xmath2 @xmath3 and the corresponding inverse recombination processes are @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is hydrogen in one of the excited states with the principal quantum number @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the hydrogen molecular ion in the ground electronic state ( @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 is a free electron .",
    "consequently , in this case the efficiency of the chemi - ionization and chemi - recombination processes has to be compared with the efficiency of the processes @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy of a photon with wavelength @xmath15 .",
    "let us emphasize the fact that in this paper just the hydrogen case is at the focus , since our main aim is to draw attention of astronomers to the processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) - ( [ eq:2b ] ) , and to show that the importance of these processes for non - lte modeling of solar atmosphere should be investigated .",
    "for this purpose , it should be demonstrated that in the solar photosphere the efficiency of these processes is greater than , or at least comparable to , the efficiency of processes ( [ eq:3i ] ) - ( [ eq:5r ] ) within those ranges of values of @xmath7 and temperature @xmath16 which are relevant to the chosen solar atmosphere model .",
    "however , by now only for chemi - recombination processes ( [ eq:2a ] ) and ( [ eq:2b ] ) it was qualitatively shown that for @xmath17 their efficiency is comparable with the efficiency of the concurrent processes ( [ eq:4r ] ) and ( [ eq:5r ] ) in a part of the solar photosphere ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the results of new complete calculations are presented here , which are necessary for achieving the aim of this work .",
    "all the calculations are performed on the basis of the well - known model c of the solar atmosphere from @xcite , since it is only for this model that all the data needed for various calculations are provided in tabular form .",
    "certainly , we keep in mind also that in @xcite this model is cited as practically the single adequate non - lte model of the solar atmosphere .",
    "besides all mentioned , the fact that the processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) - ( [ eq:2b ] ) are very important for the solar photosphere is supported by the results obtained in @xcite , where these processes were included ab initio in a non - lte modeling of an m red dwarf atmosphere with the effective temperature @xmath18 k , using phoenix code ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a fact was established that including even the chemi - ionization / recombination only for @xmath17 , generates significant changes ( by up to 50 percent ) , at least in the populations of hydrogen - atom excited states with @xmath19 , and if all these processes ( with @xmath7 ) are included , a significant change ( somewhere up to 2 - 3 times ) is also generated of the free electron density @xmath20 , and , as one of further consequences , significant changes in hydrogen line profiles . keeping in mind that the compositions of the solar and the considered m red dwarf s photospheres are practically the same and the values of hydrogen - atom density , @xmath20 and @xmath16 in these photospheres change within similar regions @xcite",
    ", one can expect that the influence of processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) - ( [ eq:2b ] ) on the hydrogen - atom excited states and free - electron populations in the solar atmosphere will be at least close to their influence in that of the m red dwarf , and that these processes will be very important for weakly ionized layers of the solar atmosphere .    finally , let us note the fact concerning a group of collision ion - atom radiative processes .",
    "namely , in several papers @xcite it was suggested that these processes should be included in the stellar atmosphere models , and recently it was actually realized in @xcite , and @xcite . due to a principal similarity between the mechanisms of processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) - ( [ eq:2b ] ) and these radiative processes",
    ", one can hope that the chemi - ionization / recombination processes will be also included in the stellar atmosphere models .    in this paper all the needed theoretical data , about the chemi - ionization and chemi - recombination processes",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) - ( [ eq:2b ] ) are given in section  [ sec : theory ] , while in section  [ sec : randd ] the obtained results are presented ( in figures ) demonstrating the significance of the considered processes .",
    "apart from that , all the data used for the calculation of the rate coefficients of processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) - ( [ eq:2b ] ) are given here in three tables .",
    "here we will consider processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) - ( [ eq:2b ] ) within the regions @xmath21 and @xmath22 separately . within the first region",
    "we will determine the rate coefficients for the chemi - ionization processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:1b ] ) directly , using the principle of thermodynamical balance for determination of the rate coefficients for the inverse chemi - recombination processes ( [ eq:2a ] ) and ( [ eq:2b ] ) .    the parameters which are needed in further considerations are the following : @xmath23 - the characteristic radius of rydberg atom @xmath6 ; @xmath24 - the inter - nuclear distance in the collision system @xmath25 ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 - the adiabatic potential energies of the ground and the first exited electronic states of molecular ion @xmath8 .    in accordance with the previous papers @xcite we will treat processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:1b ] ) with @xmath21 on the basis of dipole resonant mechanism , which was introduced in the considerations of @xcite for inelastic processes in thermal @xmath28$]-collisions .",
    "this means that such processes are considered as a result of resonant energy conversion within the electronic component of the collisional system @xmath25 , which is realized inside the region @xmath29 where the system @xmath25 can be presented as @xmath30 + e_{n}$ ] , and which is caused by the dipole part of the interaction of the outer electron @xmath31 with the subsystem @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "already in @xcite just chemi - ionization processes in atom - rydberg - atom collisions ( the case of alkali metal atoms ) were described on the basis of the same mechanism .",
    "after that the methods based on the dipole resonant mechanism have been used in practice for investigation of chemi - ionization processes until now ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "application of this mechanism is particularly successful within the so - called decay approximation which was examined in @xcite and immediately demonstrated to be suitable for any inelastic processes in slow @xmath33$]-collisions .",
    "let us note that in the previous papers @xcite a method from @xcite and @xcite was used , which is based on this approximation .",
    "only the decay approximation will be used here for processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:1b ] ) with @xmath21 .",
    "first , it is assumed that in the region , equation .",
    "( [ eq : qmol ] ) , the electronic state of the subsystem @xmath34 $ ] can be approximated well by one of the two adiabatic electronic states of the molecular ion @xmath8 : the ground one @xmath35 and the first excited @xmath36 , and the state of the outer electron @xmath31 - by one of the hydrogen rydberg states @xmath37 .",
    "then , it is assumed that , in the case of chemi - ionization processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:1b ] ) , we can consider that the subsystem @xmath34 $ ] is in the first excited electronic state @xmath36 with a probability of 1/2 , which means that we can describe the relative inter - nuclear motion as going on in the reflective potential @xmath27 .",
    "finally , it means that we can expect ( as a result of the mentioned electron - dipole interaction ) a decay of the initial electronic state @xmath38 + e_{n}$ ] , with a transition to the final state @xmath39 which is the root of the equation @xmath40 here @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the energies of the initial ( bound ) and final ( free ) states of the outer electron , and @xmath43 - the ionization potential of the ground - state hydrogen atom .",
    "here it is important that we have almost resonant simultaneous transitions : of the subsystem @xmath44 $ ] to the ground electronic state @xmath45 , and of the outer electron to one of the free states @xmath46 .",
    "in accordance with @xcite we will characterize processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:1b ] ) by quantities @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . the first quantity has the meaning of mean decay velocity of the considered system s initial state and is given by relations @xmath50 where @xmath10 is the electron charge , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the density of the free single - electron states in the energy space . following @xcite and @xcite",
    "we will transform equation  ( [ eq : w ] ) to the simple form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the projection of @xmath55 on the inter - nuclear axis , @xmath56 is the generalized gaunt factor , defined in @xcite , @xmath57 is the mean photo - ionization cross section of the atom @xmath6 for the given @xmath42 , and @xmath58 is the same photo - ionization cross section , but in kramers s approximation @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the probabilities of the realization of the chemi - ionization processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:1b ] ) respectively , for given @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in the previous papers @xcite , the influence of the initial state s decay ( during the collision ) on its amplitude was neglected in order to simplify the used procedure",
    ". however , it generates errors which are larger then @xmath61 percent for @xmath62 .",
    "consequently , in this work the said influence is taken into account and a procedure similar to the ones from @xcite and @xcite is used .",
    "therefore we will present here only the final expressions for the ionization probabilities @xmath63 , the partial cross - sections @xmath64 and the corresponding partial rate coefficients @xmath65 , where @xmath16 is the temperature of the considered plasma , using additional parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which are the roots of equations @xmath69 respectively .    in the case",
    "when only one of the processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) and [ eq:1b ] ) is realized , the ionization probabilities are obtained in the form @xmath70 and in the case of realization of both processes we have it that @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath59 and @xmath73 are the impact parameter and the atom - rydberg - atom impact energy , respectively ( @xmath74 being the reduced mass of the collision system )    @xmath75 is the radial inter - nuclear velocity , which is given by @xmath76}.\\ ] ] then , from equations .",
    "( [ eq : pfin1 ] ) - ( [ eq : vrad ] ) the partial cross sections @xmath64 are determined , namely , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the upper limit of values @xmath59 , at which the corresponding region @xmath24 is reached for a given @xmath60 .    after that , the partial rate coefficients for the chemi - ionization processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:1b ] ) with @xmath21 are determined by expressions @xmath79 where @xmath80 is defined by equation ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , @xmath81 is the atom - rydberg - atom impact velocity , @xmath82 is the velocity distribution function for the given temperature @xmath16 , and : @xmath83 if @xmath84 ; @xmath85 if @xmath86 ; @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is such a point that @xmath89 ; @xmath90 .",
    "finally , using partial rate coefficients @xmath91 , we will determine the total one , namely , @xmath92 which characterizes the efficiency of the chemi - ionization processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:1b ] ) together .      under the conditions which exist in the solar atmosphere",
    ", we can determine the chemi - recombination rate coefficients ( as functions of @xmath16 ) from the principle of thermodynamical balance for processes ( [ eq:1a],[eq:1b ] ) and ( [ eq:2a],[eq:2b ] ) , namely , @xmath93 @xmath94 where the chemi - ionization rate coefficient @xmath95 is expressed through the dissociative recombination rate coefficient @xmath96 by relation @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 denote the densities of ground- and excited - state hydrogen atoms respectively , while @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the densities of atomic ions @xmath102 and molecular ions @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the index @xmath103 denotes that molecular ion density corresponds to thermodynamical equilibrium condition for given @xmath16 .",
    "factor @xmath104 can be determined as in @xcite in connection with the contribution of @xmath105 radiative collision processes to the solar atmosphere s opacity in uv and vuv region .",
    "taking quantity @xmath95 as the rate coefficient for process ( [ eq:2a ] ) , we can characterize both chemi - recombination processes ( [ eq:2a ] ) and ( [ eq:2b ] ) in a similar way .",
    "namely , in accordance with equations  ( [ eq : kra ] ) and ( [ eq : krb ] ) , rate coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath106 are given by relations @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the electron mass and @xmath109 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "consequently , using such partial rate coefficients , we can introduce here the total one , i.e. , @xmath110 which characterizes the efficiency of processes [ eq:2a ] ) and ( [ eq:2b ] ) together for @xmath21 .",
    "the reason why the regions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are being considered separately is the behavior of the adiabatic potential curves of atom - atom systems @xmath25 .",
    "namely , in the first region the atom - atom curves lie above the adiabatic curve of the ion - ion system @xmath112 for any @xmath24 , and the dipole resonant mechanism can be applied for @xmath21 without any exceptions , while in the other region there are points where the atom - atom curves cross the ion - ion one and application of this mechanism generates some errors ( see @xcite ) . since the corresponding cross - points for @xmath113 are so far from the point @xmath114 that their existence could be neglected for @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and with some caution even for @xmath117 , the dipole resonant mechanism was applicable , for example , in @xcite and @xcite for @xmath115 and in @xcite for @xmath118",
    "however , now we can determine the values of rate coefficients @xmath95 of dissociative recombination process ( [ eq:2a ] ) for @xmath117 , @xmath116 , and @xmath119 using the results deduced from the experimental data of @xcite , presented in @xcite .    due to this fact and the mentioned errors , we use here semi - empirical rate coefficients @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which are obtained from @xcite , for the dominant processes of the dissociative recombination , i.e. , for process ( [ eq:2a ] ) with @xmath118 and @xmath119",
    ". the corresponding chemi - ionization rate coefficients @xmath122 and @xmath123 are obtained then from the principle of thermodynamical balance , as it has been described above .",
    "for relatively minor chemi - ionization / recombination processes , i.e. for processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) and ( [ eq:2a ] ) with @xmath117 , we use here rate coefficients @xmath124 and @xmath125 , which are @xmath61 - @xmath126 percent greater than the corresponding coefficients obtained using the data from @xcite , in accordance with the calculated results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it gives a possibility to compensate the decrease of rate coefficients @xmath127 and @xmath128 in comparison with the corresponding ones obtained using @xcite , due to the fact that here , unlike @xcite , the decay of the considered system s initial electronic state has been taken into account .",
    "for other chemi - ionization and recombination processes ( [ eq:1b ] ) and ( [ eq:2b ] ) with @xmath22 , whose contribution could really be neglected , the corresponding rate coefficients will be determined ( in accordance with what was said above ) by extrapolation of those from the region @xmath21 .",
    "finally , let us note that in further considerations for chemi - ionization and recombination processes ( [ eq:1a ] ) - ( [ eq:2b ] ) with @xmath129 we will use also total rate coefficients , which are given by the same expressions ( [ eq : kzbir ] ) and ( [ eq : kr0 ] ) , but for @xmath130 .",
    "in accordance with the aim of this work we consider here model c of solar atmosphere from @xcite . namely , this is a non - lte model which is still actual ( see @xcite ) , and it is only for this model that all the quantities necessary for our calculations are available in tabular form as functions of height ( @xmath131 ) in solar photosphere . in figure",

    "however , even for @xmath133=8 this deviation is around 40 percent around @xmath131 = 500 km , illustrating the importance of taking into account the considered processes ab initio in the modeling of solar atmosphere .",

    "this means that the chemi - ionization processes influence the radiative properties of the whole solar atmosphere in the optical region considerably .",
