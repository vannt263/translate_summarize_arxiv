    "our 2009 october observations were performed just before the 2009 giant x - ray outburst of a0535 + 26 and the h@xmath0 emission showed the strongest intensity of the last twenty years . the h@xmath0 profiles on 2009 december 11 ( mjd  55176 ) , which were observed during the rising phase of the 2009 giant x - ray outburst , showed a subtle change relative to its structure before the outburst .",
    "moreover , the wings of the h@xmath0 lines in 2009 also became much broader than that in 2007 and 2008 .",
    "about one year later , the h@xmath0 emission line returned to its normal level , but its peak intensity was still stronger than that in 2007 , while its wings were a bit narrower .",
    "as shown in figure  [ figure : spectra ] , the hei  @xmath6  6678 line nearly lost its emission feature during our 2007 observations and showed a weak double - peaked profile with r / v@xmath71 during the 2008 observations . like the h@xmath0 line , hei  @xmath6  6678 shows the largest intensity during our 2009 october observations which were obtained before the 2009 giant x - ray outburst .",

    "we focus on the optical variability during the x - ray outbursts and the phase of the disc loss and renewal around the oe star , that can be divided into four activity cycles .    *",
    "* cycle i * ( mjd  48850 - 50350 ) a series of x - ray outbursts were observed by batse before and after the giant x - ray outburst in 1994 february @xcite .",
    "@xcite has discussed the multi - wavelength variability of a0535 + 26 in this cycle .",
    "as shown in figure  [ figure : hdpart1 ] , the first normal x - ray outburst during this cycle took place in an optical brightness decline phase . the v - band apparent magnitude of a0535",
    "+ 26 began to increase around mjd  48850 , and reached a magnitude of @xmath8@xmath9 @xmath10 around mjd  49050 .",
    "however , the ews of h@xmath0 emission line showed an obvious increase in this time interval .",
    "after that , the brightness of the system kept increasing and reached a maximum around mjd  49250 .",
    "the second x - ray outburst was observed during this optical brightening process .",
    "the following normal and giant x - ray outbursts were detected in an abrupt decline phase of the optical emission .",
    "another two normal x - ray outbursts also occurred in the such a phase .",
    "the strength of h@xmath0 kept declining after the giant x - ray outburst .",
    "after mjd@xmath949800 , the optical brightness of a0535 + 26 began to increase and reached a magnitude of @xmath8@xmath9 @xmath10 around mjd  50350 .",
    "in the phase of the optical brightening , the h@xmath0 ews did not change considerably . * * cycle ii * ( mjd  50350 - 52560 ) during this cycle , a0535 + 26 underwent the events of the disk loss and renewal .",
    "after mjd  50350 , the v - band magnitudes increased until mjd  50550 , while the strength of h@xmath0 line became stronger during this time .",
    "it is hard to imagine what had happened in the system between mjd  50550 and mjd  50650 due to the bad coverage of the v - band data .",
    "but we could deduce from figure  [ figure : hdpart1 ] that the optical brightness of a0535 + 26 was still declining after mjd  50650 , and this decline phase is different from the former one .",
    "after mjd  50550 , the strength of h@xmath0 decreased continually .",
    "when the apparent magnitude of a0535 + 26 reached a maximum around mjd  50800 , the h@xmath0 intensity still kept declining and reached a minimum around mjd  51050 .",
    "then the optical brightness and the intensity of the h@xmath0 line kept increasing and a new circumstellar disk was reforming around oe star .",
    "when the v - band brightness reached a stable state around mjd  52000 , the intensity of the h@xmath0 emission line was still in an increasing phase and it reached a maximum around mjd  50350 . * * cycle iii * ( mjd  53300 - 53800 ) during this cycle , a giant x - ray outburst occurred in may / june 2005 after ten years of inactivity of the be / x - ray binary a0535 + 26 .",
    "two subsequent normal x - ray outbursts were also observed in the system .",
    "as shown in figure  [ figure : hdpart2 ] , the 2005 giant x - ray outburst took place during the increasing phase of the integral / omc v - band magnitudes and the first normal x - ray outburst occurred at the time when its v - band brightness showed a minimum around mjd  53615 . the next normal x - ray outburst was observed in the following optical decline phase . in the increasing phase of the v - band magnitude ,",
    "the strength of the h@xmath0 emission line became slightly stronger .",
    "it is interesting that the strength of the h@xmath0 line dropped abruptly when the optical brightness began to increase . *",
    "* cycle iv * ( mjd  54600 - 55600 ) eight continuous normal and one giant x - ray outburst was observed during this cycle .",
    "though the time - resolution of the v - band observations is not very good , one can still see from figure  [ figure : hdpart2 ] that the first four normal x - ray outbursts occurred during the fading and brightening phases of the optical brightness between mjd  54700 and mjd  55100 , which is similar to the first two normal x - ray outbursts occurred in cycle i ( see figure  [ figure : hdpart1 ] ) .",
    "the 2009 december giant x - ray outburst and subsequent three normal x - ray outbursts were observed during another fading phase of the optical brightness . according to our 2010 optical photometric observations ,",
    "the optical brightness of a0535 + 26 was still in a low level .",
    "the v - band magnitudes and ews of h@xmath0 emission line were in a stable level for a long time before cycle iv .",
    "the strength of h@xmath0 began to increase when the optical brightness started to fade around mjd  54600 , and it reached an unprecedented maximum , with an ew of @xmath925@xmath11 , during our 2009 october observations , which were obtained just before the 2009 giant x - ray outbursts . our observations on 2009 december 11 ( mjd  55176 , during the rising phase of the giant x - ray outburst ) indicate that the strength of h@xmath0 was in a slightly lower level than that in our 2009 october observations ( also see figure  [ figure : spectra ] ) .",
    "our 2010 observational results indicate that the h@xmath0 intensity had been decreased to the level before cycle iv .",
    "@xcite found that the x - ray outbursts in be / x - ray binary a0535 + 26 usually occurred after a period in which the optical light curve had seen to fade .",
    "our analysis in subsection  [ sub_long ] also indicates that the recent 2005 and 2009 giant x - ray outbursts were also observed during a fading phase of the optical brightness ( see figure  [ figure : hd ] ) .",
    "it is interesting that the intensity of the h@xmath0 line in the spectra of a0535 + 26 showed an obvious increase during the fading of the optical brightness in cycle iv of figure  [ figure : hdpart2 ] .",
    "similar observational phenomenon was also observed in cycle i of figure  [ figure : hdpart1 ] .",
    "to explain the anti - correlation between the optical brightness and the h@xmath0 intensity in a0535 + 26 , we should first know the physical origin of the optical continuum and h@xmath0 emission in the system .",
    "the optical thick h@xmath0 emission line in be star is generally believed to be formed in the entire circumstellar disk @xcite , while only the innermost part of the disk contributes significantly to the continuum flux . due to the higher ionization potential energy , the formation region of the hei  @xmath66678 line should be smaller than the nearby continuum region @xcite .",
    "the strength of the h@xmath0 line became stronger during our 2009 observations , while its v - band brightness kept fading during that period .",
    "the increase of the h@xmath0 emission might be caused by the decrease of the optical continuum around the h@xmath0 region .",
    "in fact , our optical observations in 2010 indicate that even the optical brightness was still in a fading phase , the strength of the h@xmath0 emission line had declined to its level in our 2007 observations . therefore , we suggest that the obvious increase of the h@xmath0 intensity during our 2009 observations was not only caused by the decrease of the optical continuum in a0535 + 26 .",
    "the correlation between the @xmath12 magnitude and the @xmath13 colour in a0535 + 26 @xcite indicates that the variability in the @xmath14 photometric observations was connected with the changes in the emission from the circumstellar disk around the oe star @xcite .",
    "therefore , the only source for the variability of the v - band brightness is the circumstellar disk around the hd  245770 .",
    "the decrease of the v - band brightness during cycle iv might indicate that great changes had taken place in the inner region of the disk",
    ". the strong h@xmath0 emission during our 2009 observations might be due to the formation of a larger circumstellar disk before the giant outburst in 2009 .",
    "figure  [ figure : spectra ] shows that the hei  @xmath66678 became much stronger during our 2009 observations and it still had a strong emission during our 2010 observations , which may be attributed to a denser inner part of the disk formed before the 2009 giant x - ray outburst .",
    "it seems to be contradictory that the optical brightness became faint when a dense inner disk was formed , if we assume the optical excess comes from the disk around the oe star .",
    "a unified model should be assumed to explain all the observed features in a0535 + 26 .",
    "observational results @xcite and theoretical calculations @xcite suggest that after an outburst in be star a low - density region seems to develop above the star . about the nature of the outburst",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the outburst might be connected with the increased mass loss or mass ejection from be star .",
    "some weeks to months after the outburst , the stellar radiation pressure gradually excavates the inner part of the disk and a low - density region could develop around the be star and slowly grow outwards @xcite . with the vacuation of the inner disk , the optical continuum emission decreases and an increase in @xmath14 magnitudes will be observed .",
    "as shown in figure  [ figure : hdpart2 ] , the v - band magnitude began to increase at the beginning of cycle iv .",
    "the decrease of the v - band continuum emission indicates that a mass ejection event from be star had taken place before mjd  54600 . after the mass ejection",
    ", a low density region was forming around the be star .",
    "besides the decrease of the optical continuum emission , the vacuation of the inner disk could also cause the inner circumstellar disk changes from optically thick to optically thin , which could increase the volume of the helium line emission .",
    "therefore , the optical thin line , such as hei  6678 , appeared after the mass ejection , and became stronger when the optical continuum emission was decaying .",
    "moreover , a lot material would be transferred into the disk after the mass ejection event and the outer part of the disk would move outward . a more extended circumstellar disk should correspond to a stronger h@xmath0 emission .",
    "this may explain the detected increasing behavior of h@xmath0 emission presented in figure  [ figure : hdpart2 ] .",
    "the v - band brightness did not show a continuous decline during cycle iv .",
    "the optical brightness of a0535 + 26 began to decrease around mjd  54600 and showed an increase during the following four normal x - ray outbursts .",
    "the increase of the optical emission indicated that a subsequent outburst had taken place and the cavity region was replenished by the ejected material . with the outward motion of the ejected material",
    ", a secondary inner circumstellar disk would be formed around the star and a ring - like structure was developing in the disk .",
    "when the disk expanded to a certain extent , the neutron star would come inside the circumstellar envelope of the be star and accrete matter , becoming a transient source .",
    "this may account for the first four normal x - ray outbursts in cycle iv .",
    "a considerable fraction of the angular momentum would be transferred on to the neutron star in the system , which may account for the simultaneous spin - up detected by fermi / gbm @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that a distinguished double - peaked profile was observed by swift / bat in the fourth x - ray outburst during cycle iv ( see figure  [ figure : double ] ) .",
    "the profile of the outburst might be connected with the accreting environment of the neutron star .",
    "there should be a low - density region in the circumstellar disk when the neutron star was approaching the perisatron point around mjd  55057.3 ( the vertical dashed line in figure  [ figure : double ] ) .",
    "this low - density region might be the low - density ring structure discussed above . assuming the circumstellar disk of a0535 + 26 dissipated on a viscous timescale",
    ", we can estimate the viscosity parameter @xmath0 @xcite using equation ( 19 ) of @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the diffusion time of the low - density region from the surface of the oe star to the periastron point and @xmath17 is the radial distance from the oe star to the periastron point of the neutron star . we assume that the time for the formation of the low - density region corresponds to the initial moment of the optical brightness decrease , @xmath9mjd  54600 .",
    "thus , @xmath16 is about 457.3  days .",
    "given that the mass @xmath18 and the radius @xmath19 of the oe star hd  245770 are @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite , respectively , and the typical mass for a neutron star is @xmath22 , the value of @xmath23 is approximately 8.6 , for an orbital period of 111.1  days with an eccentricity of @xmath90.47 .",
    "therefore , the viscosity parameter @xmath0 is @xmath90.47 estimated by equation  [ euqation1 ] .",
    "this result indicates that the circumstellar disk around oe star in a0535 + 26 will be truncated at the 4:1 resonance radius @xcite , which will allow enough mass accretion on to the neutron star at the periastron passage to cause the x - ray outburst in the system during cycle iv .",
    "very strong h@xmath0 emission was observed during our 2009 observations , when the v - band brightness showed an obvious decrease , which indicated a strong mass ejection had taken place before our 2009 observations and a lot of material was replenished the circumstellar disk .",
    "an extended and dense circumstellar disk caused the strong x - ray outburst during cycle iv .",
    "after the 2009 strong x - ray outburst , the disk around oe star could also be truncated by the neutron star in a0535 + 26 and the strength of the h@xmath0 emission line showed a rapid decline .",
    "one year later , the emission of h@xmath0 line had returned to its level in the quiescent state .",
    "figure  [ figure : hdpart1 ] shows that the v - band light curve during cycle i has the same variability as that during cycle iv .",
    "the decrease of the optical brightness during the first stage of cycle i might also be caused by the discrete mass ejection from the oe star .",
    "the second abrupt decrease of the optical brightness indicated a lot of material was filled in the disk , which caused the 1994 giant x - ray outburst .",
    "the anti - correlation between the optical brightness and the strength of the h@xmath0 emission line was also observed during the first decrease of the v - band brightness .",
    "however , the h@xmath0 did not display a very strong emission during the subsequent abrupt decrease of the optical brightness . with the extension of the decretion disk",
    ", it will be truncated by the gravitational interaction of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the truncation depends strongly on the gap between the truncation radius and the inner lagrangian point and the viscosity of the disk .",
    "when the neutron star passes the periastron point , the decretion disk will be truncated efficiently .",
    "we can see from figure  [ figure : hdpart2 ] that after the giant x - ray outbursts , the intensity of the h@xmath0 decreased rapidly , which meant that the outer part of the decretion disk had been truncated by the neutron star .",
    "for the lines formed in the inner region of the decretion disk , such as hei  @xmath66678 , they could not truncated by the neutron star even around the periastron .",
    "figure 1 in @xcite indicates that when the h@xmath0 intensity showed a gradual decrease after the 1994 giant x - ray outburst , the hei  @xmath66678 still had a strong emission .",
    "our observational results shown in figure  [ figure : spectra ] also indicated that the hei  @xmath66678 during our 2010 observations was still in a strong emission even the h@xmath0 has decreased to its 2007 level .",
    "a0535 + 26 underwent disk loss and subsequent renewal events during cycle ii in figure  [ figure : hdpart1 ] .",
    "the anti - correlation between the optical brightness and the h@xmath0 intensity was observed between mjd  50350 and mjd  50550 . due to bad coverage of the v - band magnitude and the h@xmath0 ews in the following 100 days",
    ", we could not know when the optical brightness decreased to its minimum and the intensity of h@xmath0 reached its maximum . in cycle",
    "ii , both the optical and the h@xmath0 line emission kept fading after mjd  50670 .",
    "it seems that the decay timescales of the optical brightness are different during the increasing and decreasing phases of the h@xmath0 intensity .",
    "they should have different physical origins .",
    "the optical fading between mjd  50350 and mjd  50550 might be caused by the mass ejection from the oe star , and the subsequent fading of the optical brightness should be the indicator for the dilution of the decretion disk around the oe star .",
    "the increase of the h@xmath0 intensity at the beginning of cycle ii means the ejected mass had been transferred into the decretion disk . after the mass ejection event , a low - density region would be formed around the oe star . with the extension of this low density region",
    ", the decretion disk will be a ring - like structure .",
    "if there was no mass ejection taking place in the system , the disk around the oe star will be lost . because the inner region of the disk has a major contribution to the optical continuum emission",
    "while the h@xmath0 emission could be formed in the entire disk , the optical brightness of a0535 + 26 reached a stable faint state around mjd  50800 before the h@xmath0 line turned from emission into absorption around mjd  51100 .",
    "the subsequent disk renewal phase may be caused by the discrete mass ejections from the oe star . due to the smaller emission region for the optical continuum ,",
    "the intensity of h@xmath0 still kept increasing , when the v - band brightness showed a stable level during cycle ii .    the 2005 giant x - ray outburst in cycle iii of figure  [ figure : hdpart2 ]",
    "was also observed during the fading phase of the optical brightness in a0535 + 26 .",
    "the intensity of the h@xmath0 line did not showed the obvious increase before the 2005 giant x - ray outburst .",
    "however , it shows an abrupt decrease after the giant x - ray outburst , which might be caused by the truncation of the neutron star .",
    "a pre - outburst structure was observed in the following normal x - ray outburst around mjd  53600 @xcite , which might also be connected with the low - density region formed after the mass ejection .",

    "the anti - correlation between the v - band magnitudes and the h@xmath0 ews during our 2009 observations indicated a mass ejection event had taken place before the 2009 giant x - ray outburst , which caused the formation of a low - density region in the disk . according to the diffusion time of the low - density region from the oe star to the periastron point",
