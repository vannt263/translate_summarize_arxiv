    "the possibility of engineering the phase matching of nonlinear crystals has allowed for a wide range of engineered quantum states of light .    in particular",
    ", the use of collinear sources , i.e. sources where the generated photons are emitted along the propagation direction of the pump beam , allows for a tight control of the momentum and polarization correlations of the down - converted photons .",
    "collinear sources based on type 0 periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) can generate entangled photons which are momentum correlated and have the same linear polarization .",
    "their polarization can then be transformed to the required helicity basis with a quarter waveplate .",
    "the momentum correlation is achieved by using a pump beam with a width which is much smaller than @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the length of the crystal and @xmath132 the wavenumber of the pump beam . in the two - photon state",
    ", the terms exhibiting correlations between non - parallel momenta can not be completely suppressed , but can be made arbitrarily small by either increasing the length of the crystal or using a tighter pump focus @xcite .    in order to emulate an arbitrary gravitational wave , superpositions of photon pairs with both helicities are required .",
    "this can be achieved by combining two of the described sources with orthogonal linear polarizations before the quarter waveplate .",
    "we note that the parameter @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : etw ] ) , which ties together all the electromagnetic tensor states that are equivalent to a single gravitational wave , has a physical correspondence in the source of momentum correlated photons .",
    "it corresponds to the split of the frequency of the pump @xmath133 , which we assume monochromatic , into the frequencies of the emitted photons ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "since energy conservation enforces @xmath135 , we may write @xmath136 and @xmath137 for @xmath76 , which makes the correspondence clear . should the metamaterial exhibit a significant frequency dependence , @xmath138 can be chosen by means of a narrow - band interference filter selecting the frequency degenerate down - converted photon .",
    "this completes the design of a quantum source of light , capable of emulating a gravitational wave .    for the detection of the field",
    "after it has passed through the metamaterial , we need to keep in mind that we are emulating single - body objects by means of two - body objects .",
    "the measurements should rely on detecting both photons `` at the same place and at the same time '' .",
    "this may be done by counting coincidences , where both photons of a pair arrive at the detector within a very small time interval .",
    "measurements that are unique to a two - particle state , like quantum interference , have no correspondence in the gravitational wave case , which places them outside the emulation framework .",
    "the applicability of the emulation scheme to a particular background metric is determined by the applicability of the theoretical results contained in the previous section : the amplitudes of the gravitational waves must be much smaller than those of the background , and , the waves must vary much faster than the background ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : regime ] ) ) . for a given wavelength",
    ", this last condition limits the maximum allowable curvature . when the curvature increases , e.g. while approaching a singularity , the applicability reduces to correspondingly smaller wavelengths .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the propagation of gravitational waves in a curved spacetime background is equivalent to the propagation of a restricted set of electromagnetic tensor product waves .",
    "the defining characteristics of gravitational waves , zero mass and possible helicities equal to @xmath52 , select the appropriate subspace of electromagnetic states .",
    "they turn out to be the tensor products of two electromagnetic waves of the same helicity and parallel momentum .",
    "therefore , any linearly or elliptically polarized gravitational wave can be expanded as the sum of two electromagnetic tensor waves , one for each circular polarization handedness .",
    "the consideration of helicity eigenstates of both the gravitational and the electromagnetic waves has been crucial : a linearly polarized gravitational wave can not be formally factorized as a tensor product of two electromagnetic waves , while a circularly polarized gravitational wave can .",
    "our analysis is restricted to gravitational waves of small amplitude that vary rapidly with respect to the spacetime background and propagate in empty space . as far as we know , this equivalence has not been reported before .",
    "we have shown that the implementation of the equivalence needs genuine quantum correlations between two photon states . as an application of these results",
    ", we have proposed a path for the quantum emulation of the propagation of gravitational waves by means of experimental electromagnetic setups .",
    "first , the equivalence derived in this article is applied to map the gravitational waves into electromagnetic tensor waves , then the conformal invariance of electromagnetism is used to shrink the problem from large wavelengths and large sized spacetime features down to suitable sizes , and finally , the scaled down curved spacetime background is emulated in the laboratory by an appropriate material medium .",
    "precisely this type of media are already the object of research in the field of metamaterials .    to finish , we suggest that the decomposition of gravitational waves into tensor products of electromagnetic waves could be used to reduce the complexity of simulating gravitational waves in a computer . if the scenario of interest meets the specified restrictions , setting @xmath138 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonflat ] ) , one can first simulate the propagation of two electromagnetic vector waves , one for each helicity , and then sum the tensor products of each resulting vector wave with itself .",
    "future expansions of this framework could include its extension outside the geometrical optics approximation in order to study the interaction of gravitational waves with strongly curved spacetimes , and the use of nonlinear optical metamaterials capable of reproducing the back action of the gravitational wave on the background metric .",
