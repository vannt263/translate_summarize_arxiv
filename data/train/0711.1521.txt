    "emission from high - velocity molecular gas in this field is also reported by @xcite , who detect a highly asymmetric co bipolar outflow .",
    "the emission of the redshifted outflow lobe is spatially more extended than the blueshifted lobe and encompasses the region around _ iras _  and hhl  73 .",
    "in addition , the detection of a water maser near hhl  73 was reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite imaged the hhl  73 field through narrow - band h@xmath0 and [ sii]@xmath26717 , 6731   filters .",
    "they find two stellar - like condensations @xmath8 2.5 arcmin west of hhl  73 with similar h@xmath0 and [ sii]surface brightness , surrounded by diffuse emission .",

    "these authors also discuss a plausible association between the _ iras _  source and the undetected exciting source of hh  379 .",

    "clean maps were obtained using the task mappr of aips with the robust parameter set equal to 5 , which is close to natural weighting .",

    "data reduction was performed using a preliminary version of the r3d software @xcite , in combination with iraf and the euro3d packages @xcite .",
    "the reduction consists of the standard steps for fibre - based integral field spectroscopy .",

    "the location of the spectra in the ccd was determined using a continuum - illuminated exposure taken before the science exposures .",
    "each spectrum was extracted from the science frames by co - adding the flux within an aperture of five pixels along the cross - dispersion axis for each pixel in the dispersion axis , and stored it in a row - stacked - spectrum ( rss ) file @xcite . at the date of the observations we lacked a proper calibration unit for ppak .",
    "therefore , the wavelength calibration was performed iteratively .",
    "first , we illuminated the science fibres using dome _",
    "lamps with the telescope at the location of the objects .",
    "these lamps have well defined emission lines in the wavelength range considered , although the line elements and wavelength are ignored at this step .",
    "these exposures were used to correct for distortions in the wavelength solution , fixing all the spectra to a common ( ignored ) solution .",
    "after that , the wavelength solution was found using hgne lamps that illuminated only the calibration fibres .",
    "differences in the fibre - to - fibre transmission throughput were corrected by comparing the wavelength - calibrated rss science frames with the corresponding continuum illuminated ones .",
    "the final wavelength solution was set by using the sky emission lines found in the observed wavelength range .",
    "the achieved accuracy for the wavelength calibration was better than @xmath47   ( @xmath48 km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "observations of a standard star were used to perform a relative flux calibration .",
    "a final datacube containing the 2d spatial plus the spectral information of hhl  73 was then created from the 3d data by using euro3d tasks to interpolate the data spatially until reaching a final grid of 2.16 arcsec of spatial resolution and 0.3   of spectral resolution .",
    "further manipulation of this datacube , devoted to obtaining integrated emission line maps , channel maps and position  velocity maps , were made using several common - users tasks of starlink , iraf and gildas astronomical packages and ida @xcite , a specific suit of idl software for analysing 3d data .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the h@xmath0 image of the hhl  73 field obtained at the int . the hhl  73 object appears projected on a dark cloud near its southwestern border .",
    "the object presents in this h@xmath0 image the comet - shaped morphology already found in the _ dss _ plates . because of the low effective spatial resolution of the image resulting from both the pixel scale and the seeing , we were unable to resolve any structure in the morphology of the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "neither were we able to elucidate from this image whether the emission of hhl  73 originates mainly from scattered starlight from an embedded point - source , as suggested by @xcite , or whether the emission mainly arises from gas photoionized or shock - excited by an external source .",
    "the error ellipse of _ iras _  21432 + 4719 does not encompass hhl  73 . from the astrometry performed on the h@xmath0 image",
    ", we derived that the _ iras_catalogue position is @xmath46 arcsec northeast of the hhl  73 h@xmath0 emission peak ( @xmath49 pc for a distance of 900 pc ) .",
    "a _ 2mass _",
    "source is found very close to hhl  73 ( there is an offset of @xmath50 arcsec between the position given for the infrared source in the _",
    "2mass _  catalogue and the position of the h@xmath0 emission peak of hhl  73 ) .",
    "the nebulosities cited by @xcite as hh  379 are also visible in our int image close to a bright field star ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , despite a careful inspection of the hhl  73 field imaged in h@xmath0 , we were unable to identify any other nebular emission suggestive of being part of a putative optical jet related to hh  379 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the narrow - band h@xmath0 and [ sii ]  images obtained at the not have less depth than the int image .",
    "however the higher spatial resolution achieved in the not images make them suitable for resolving the structure of the hhl  73 object .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the close - up of the not images including the hhl  73 object in the h@xmath0 ( right ) and [ sii ]  ( left ) bands .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , these images allow us to resolve several components in the emission of hhl  73 : the comet - shaped morphology detected in the optical int images of lower spatial resolution now appears split into two components of different surface brightness with a darker lane between them .",
    "the estimated distance between the peaks of the two hhl  73 components is @xmath51 arcsec ( @xmath52  pc for a distance of 900  pc ) .",
    "in addition , a lower brightness and more collimated emission tail , showing a couple of brightness enhancements suggestive of the `` knots '' of a microjet , emanates from the brighter northwestern component and extends @xmath1 arcsec towards the west at @xmath53 .",
    "all these hhl  73 components are found in both not images .",
    "however , some differences are appreciated when the emission from the two bands is compared : the northwestern component is the brighter one in both filters , h@xmath0 and [ sii ] .",
    "the southeastern component appears dimmer , as compared with the northwestern one , in h@xmath0 than in [ sii ] .",
    "the emission tail is brighter and has higher collimation in [ sii ]  than in h@xmath0 ( as would be expected from a jet ) .",
    "furthermore , while the emission peak positions of h@xmath0 and [ sii ]  are coincident in the southeastern component , the h@xmath0 peak position in the northwestern component is offset by @xmath54 arcsec towards the southwest from the [ sii ]  emission peak position .",
    "thus , differences in the excitation conditions between the two hhl  73 components might be present .",
    "finally , note that the position angle of hh 379 , as seen from hhl  73 , is @xmath55 @xcite , close to that of the hhl  73 microjet .",
    "thus , although the deep int h@xmath0 image does not show any other nebulosity connecting both emissions , hh 379 could form part of the hhl  73 optical outflow , provided that the outflow direction undergoes a bending of @xmath56 , as seen in other optical outflows propagating in a inhomogeneous medium @xcite .      in order to complement the ccd and ifs data of hhl  73 , we analysed the data of the emission at radio wavelengths available for the hhl  73 field .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] ( left panel ) shows the continuum map at 3.6 cm towards hhl  73 overlaid on the _ k_-band _ 2mass _  image .",
    "we detected two centimetre sources , vla  1 and vla  2 , separated @xmath57 arcsec ( 0.2  pc in projection at the distance of the source ) , located near the catalogue position of _ iras _  21432 + 4719 .",
    "both centimetre sources are also associated with _",
    "2mass _  point sources .",
    "in table 1 we list the positions , flux densities and deconvolved sizes of the detected sources in the hhl  73 region . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( right panel ) we show the 3.6 cm centimetre continuum emission arising from the hhl  73 object overlaid on the [ sii ]   image .",
    "the peak position of the centimetre source vla  1 is close ( @xmath58 arcsec south ) to the position of the [ sii ]  emission peak .",
    "the centimetre emission from the hhl  73 object is slightly elongated towards the secondary peak detected in the [ sii]-band images to the southeast .      in 1985",
    "h@xmath9o  maser emission was detected towards hhl  73 by @xcite using the 37 m radio telescope of the haystack observatory .",
    "the h@xmath9o  maser was located 10.2 arcsec west of the hhl  73 object , with a positional uncertainty that can be estimated at @xmath815 arcsec , making it difficult to ascertain whether or not the maser is associated with hhl  73 . in the archive observations analysed here",
    "we did not detect h@xmath9o  maser emission towards hhl  73 above a @xmath59 limit , indicating that at the epoch of observation ( 1994 july ) the maser was out . the upper limit estimated for the peak intensity of the h@xmath9omaser emission was 48  m@xmath28 , corresponding to a main beam brightness temperature upper limit @xmath60",
    "k.        we detected emission from characteristic hh lines within the observed wavelength range ( h@xmath0 , [ nii ]  @xmath26548 , 6584    and [ sii]@xmath106717 , 6731  ) .",
    "narrow - band images for these lines were generated from the datacube .",
    "for each position , the flux of the emission line was obtained by integrating the signal over the whole wavelength range covered by the line and subtracting a continuum obtained from the wavelengths adjacent to the emission line .",
    "the narrow - band maps of hhl  73 obtained are shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen from the panels of the figure , the emission has a similar morphology in all the mapped lines .",
    "however it should be noted that the h@xmath0 emission is slightly more extended ( @xmath61 arcsec ) towards the south than the emission from the other lines .",
    "furthermore , the [ nii ]  emission appears more compact than the h@xmath0 and [ sii ]  emission .",
    "this is mostly because the [ nii]emission has a lower surface brightness , and the collimated emission extending towards the west of the hhl  73 main body is hardly detected in the [ nii]lines .",
    "it should also be noted that the overall morphology derived from the h@xmath0 and [ sii ]  ifs images is in good agreement with the morphology found from the int ccd image . in particular",
    ", the ifs images also show the low - brightness and more collimated emission feature originating west of the hhl  73 main body .",
    "however , the lower spatial resolution of the ifs images did not allow us to resolve the two components of the hhl  73 main body discovered from the h@xmath0 and [ sii ]  not images .",
    "in addition to the integrated flux , we derived for each position the flux - weighted mean radial velocity km  s@xmath5  for the parent cloud has been taken from @xcite . ] @xmath62 , and the flux - weighted rms width of the line @xmath63 , proportional to the fwhm , which are given by @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 in spite of the spatial extension of the emission being quite compact , the velocity field derived for @xmath62 appears rather complex for all the lines and shows appreciable changes through hhl  73 , as can be seen from figure [ fig5 ] .    for all the mapped lines ,",
    "the gas appears blueshifted around the emission peak , with @xmath62 values of @xmath4 km  s@xmath5 for h@xmath0 and [ nii ] , and @xmath67 km  s@xmath5 for the [ sii ]  lines .",
    "however , the highest blueshifted velocities are found @xmath48 arcsec west of the emission peak position , where values of @xmath68  km  s@xmath5 for h@xmath0 and [ nii ] , and @xmath69 km  s@xmath5 for the [ sii ]  lines have been derived .",
    "the fwhm values obtained from the @xmath70 , corrected from the instrumental profile , are high for all the mapped lines . around the emission peak position ,",
    "fwhms are @xmath71 km  s@xmath5 for the h@xmath0 line and @xmath72 km  s@xmath5 for the [ nii ]  and [ sii ]  lines .",
    "these values are representative of the fwhms found in the whole emitting region , although the fwhms slightly increase towards the southeast and decrease towards the west from the emission peak position .",
    "such large line widths might be indicating turbulent gas motions , which are more important close to the position proposed by @xcite for an unseen embedded exciting source .",
    "another possibility is that the high fwhm values derived were due to the contribution of several kinematic components of the line profiles .",
    "we shall analyse this possibility later by using a multicomponent line profile model to fit the [ sii]profiles .",
    "line - ratio maps of the integrated line fluxes are suitable for getting spatial information about excitation conditions ( from [ sii]/h@xmath0 , [ nii]/h@xmath0 ) and electron density ( from [ sii ]  6717/6731 ) of the emitting gas . for the entire region covered by the compact bright hhl  73 emission ,",
    "the derived [ sii]6717/6731 line ratios go from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , indicating a range of electron densities @xmath754000 @xmath76 , the highest values being reached around the emission peak position .",
    "electron density lowers towards the west in the low - brightness collimated emission tail ( e.g.  [ sii ]  6717/6731 line ratio @xmath77 , corresponding to @xmath78 @xmath76 , is derived at a position @xmath48 arcsec west of the peak position ) .",
    "these values were derived for @xmath79  k.    the derived [ sii]/h@xmath0 , [ nii]/h@xmath0 line ratio distributions show a similar pattern",
    ". both line ratios peak around the emission peak position , with [ sii]/h@xmath80 and [ nii]/h@xmath81 .",
    "line ratios decrease steeply ( excitation increases ) southeast of the peak , while the decrease is slower to the west along the low - brightness emission tail .",
    "an inspection of the hhl  73 spectra at different positions revealed that the line profiles , being broad and asymmetric , display a variety of features suggesting complex gas kinematics .",
    "we will now analyse the behaviour of the emission as a function of velocity .",
    "first , we obtained the h@xmath0 , [ nii ]  and [ sii ]  channel maps to explore the 3d structure of the physical conditions as a function of the radial velocity .",
    "furthermore , to analyse the complex line profiles found along the hhl  73 emission , we extracted spectra for each spaxel within the area covered by the emission and we fitted the line profiles through a multicomponent line profile model .",

    "[ fig10 ] ]    a more detailed sampling of the gas kinematics was obtained by slicing the datacube into a set of velocity channels along each emission line profile , thus providing a `` tomograph '' of the emission line , not restricted to the centroid of the line , but including also the wings .",
    "each slice was made for a constant wavelength bin of 0.3  , corresponding to a velocity bin of @xmath86 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the channel maps obtained for h@xmath0 , [ nii ]  @xmath106584 and [ sii ]  @xmath106717   are shown in figs  [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] respectively .",
    "as we used the same wavelength bin for all the lines , the central velocity of a given channel map differs slightly from a line to another .",
    "as can be seen from figs  [ fig6 ] and [ fig8 ] , the spatial distribution of the h@xmath0 and [ sii ]  emission found from the line - integrated ifs maps ( i.e.  the compact , bright region that extends towards the west in a low - brightness and collimated tail ) is also found in all the velocity channel maps ranging from blueshifted @xmath87  velocities of @xmath88 km  s@xmath5 up to redshifted velocities of @xmath89  km  s@xmath5 in both emission lines .",
    "the emission spreads over a wide velocity range for all the mapped lines , the span of the velocity range being slightly different for each line .",

    "finally , it should be pointed out that similar kinematic structures consisting of two blueshifted ( low and high ) velocity components have already been detected in class  i yso ( @xcite ) and in microjets from t tauri stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in all the positions covered by the hhl  73 emission , the spectra extracted from the ifs datacube appear as low - ionization , line - emission spectra with no appreciable continuum emission , ( see figs  [ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] ) . in particular , the spectrum shown in fig .",

    "from the analysis carried out of the ccd and ifs hhl  73 observations , complemented with those available from the literature we found :    the bulk of the hhl  73 optical red emission is mainly line emission from shock - excited gas , such as is usually found in hh objects .",
    "continuum emission from dust scattered starlight , if present , seems to be weak .    high - spatial resolution , narrow - band images of hhl  73 resolved its bow - shaped morphology into two components and a collimated emission @xmath1 arcsec long emerging towards the west , which is reminiscent of a microjet .",
    "the kinematics of hhl  73 derived from the ifs data show that the emission is supersonic , with both blueshifted and redshifted velocities . from a line - profile multicomponent model",
    ", we were able to resolve three velocity components for the [ sii ]  @xmath26717 , 6731   emission lines .",
    "these kinematic components correlate with the morphological components discovered from the high - resolution ccd images .",
    "the redshifted component , being the most extended one , spatially correlates with the bright , extended hhl  73 emission , elongated in the north  south direction .",
    "its spatial distribution is also in good agreement with that of the radio continuum emission .",
    "the two blueshifted ( low- and high - velocity ) components are morphologically well correlated with the northwestern hhl  73 emission and the microjet . in order to mimic the complex kinematic pattern derived from the ifs spectra",
    ", we tentatively propose a scenario involving both low- and highly - collimated supersonic gas ejected from a yso .    in the light of the data here discussed , we propose that the exciting source of hhl  73 ( and possibly of hh 379 ) is deeply embedded in the dark cloud causing the high extinction , lying to the northeast of hhl  73 , close to its apex . in spite of its angular separation , _ iras",
    "_  21432 + 4719 is the most plausible candidate to be tracing the low-/intermediate yso that is driving the centimetre , _ ir _ and optical emission associated with hhl  73 , although high sensitivity observations with high angular resolution in the millimetre wavelength range , not affected by extinction , are needed to confirm this issue and to establish clearly the location and properties of the hhl  73 driving source .",
    "further observations , both in the centimetre wavelength range and ifs data covering the wavelength range blueward of h@xmath0 , to include high - excitation hh emission lines , are needed to settle the nature of the hhl  73 object completely .",
