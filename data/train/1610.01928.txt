    "quantum mechanical systems can be correlated in ways stronger than classical ones .",
    "the characterization and exploitation of such correlations is enabling the development of a wealth of quantum technologies , set to revolutionize information and communication and other industrial sectors .",
    "bell nonlocality is the strongest form of quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "it manifests when two or more subsystems are in an entangled state @xcite and additionally fulfill the more stringent condition that the outcomes of local measurements on each subsystem can not be explained by using a local hidden variable model @xcite .",
    "this entails that the entanglement distributed among the subsystems , which may be located in different laboratories , can be verified without any need for characterizing , or trusting , the measurement apparatuses available in each laboratory @xcite . in turn",
    ", this ensures that the states exhibiting bell nonlocality can be useful as resources for fully device - independent quantum communication , including in particular unconditionally secure quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "nonlocal correlations can be detected by the violation of bell - type inequalities @xcite . while a great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of bell inequalities in bipartite systems @xcite , including most recently the first loophole - free experimental demonstrations @xcite , a few criteria have been formulated for the verification of bell nonlocality in multipartite systems as well @xcite .",
    "however , the concept of _ genuine _ multipartite nonlocality has been formalized only recently from an operational point of view @xcite and its full exploration remains challenging both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "in this paper we present a theoretical study of genuine multipartite nonlocality in multimode gaussian states of infinite - dimensional systems .",
    "these states , which include squeezed and thermal states of quantized electromagnetic fields , are the theoretical pillars and the resources of choice for a number of applications in quantum information with continuous variables @xcite .",
    "their nonlocal properties have been explored in a few papers @xcite , albeit mostly limited to two or three modes .",
    "we investigate genuine multipartite nonlocality as revealed by the violation of an inequality first proposed for tripartite states by svetlichny @xcite .",
    "such an inequality can be violated e.g.  by both greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and @xmath0 classes of states for three qubits @xcite , and it stands as the conventional witness of genuine nonlocality when all three parties perform two measurements with two outcomes each @xcite , even though a large number of weaker inequalities revealing genuine nonlocality in more general settings have been constructed more recently @xcite . while originally formulated for dichotomic observables , bell - type inequalities such as the svetlichny one can be tested for continuous variable systems either by binning outcomes of observables with continuous spectrum ( typically gaussianity - preserving measurements such as homodyne detection ) @xcite , or by considering directly operators with a discrete spectrum @xcite .",
    "the first kind of approach is of no use with gaussian states , since their defining property of admitting a phase space description in terms of gaussian ( i.e. , classical - like ) wigner distributions entails that all the results of homodyne detections can be fully explained by a local hidden variable model , even for entangled states .",
    "gaussian states do exhibit trademark nonclassical and nonlocal features , as revealed by violations of bell - type inequalities using observables of the second kind ( which do not preserve gaussianity ) , including most importantly displaced parity @xcite and pseudospin @xcite .",
    "here we investigate the maximum violation of the svetlichny inequality in pure permutationally invariant multimode gaussian states , by considering these two types of measurements .",
    "for displaced parity measurements , we extend the results of @xcite from three to an arbitrary number of modes , providing a prescription to identify the phase space settings leading to the largest violations .",
    "however , we show that ( as in the case of two and three modes ) these violations do not reach the absolute maximum allowed by quantum mechanics , that is the multipartite analogue of the tsirelson bound @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", we provide substantial evidence that by using pseudospin operators one can approach such a maximum violation asymptotically in pure permutationally invariant three - mode gaussian states .",
    "this result , which mirrors the case of bipartite nonlocality in two - mode squeezed gaussian states @xcite , demonstrates theoretically that maximum genuine multipartite quantum nonlocality is in fact attainable in continuous variable gaussian states , provided arbitrarily large squeezing is available .",
    "extensions of the latter analysis to an arbitrary number of modes are certainly possible but cumbersome , since our treatment of pseudospin measurements relies on the explicit expansion of gaussian states in the fock basis .",

    "correspondingly , this entails that in the same limit one would obtain a maximum quantum violation of the svetlichny inequality using pseudospin operators with the settings of eq .",
    "( [ settino ] ) , that is , @xmath201",
    "in this paper we have studied theoretically the degree of genuine multipartite nonlocality in pure permutationally invariant gaussian states of @xmath1 bosonic modes , in terms of the largest amount by which the svetlichny inequality @xcite is violated by specific measurements .",
    "when adopting displaced parity measurements @xcite , we provided a prescription to find the optimal phase space settings in order to observe the most prominent violations of local realism , extending the results of @xcite .",
    "these measurements nevertheless fail to reveal the maximum nonlocality allowed by quantum mechanics when operating on gaussian states . for this reason we further considered pseudospin observables @xcite and provided convincing evidence that such an ultimate bound is in fact attainable on gaussian states when using these measurements , in particular in the three - mode instance .",
    "extensions of this result to a higher number of modes , exploiting the symmetries of the states as outlined in our analysis , might be feasible , even though they appear significantly more intricate than the @xmath72 instance . also in the case of pseudospin measurements , we identified particular settings which become optimal in the regime of large squeezing .",
    "these findings can be useful to guide an experimental demonstration of genuine multipartite continuous variable nonlocality for practical purposes .    in future work",
    ", it may be worth extending our study to other correlations , such as quantum steering @xcite , a weaker and asymmetric form of nonlocality which can also be detected by the violation of suitable inequalities @xcite .",
    "very recently , displaced parity and pseudospin observables have been considered to detect steerability of gaussian states @xcite , and proven useful to reveal a larger set of steerable states than what can be characterized by using gaussian measurements alone @xcite .",
    "identifying the boundaries of the sets of steerable or nonlocal gaussian states , and the maximum allowed violations of corresponding inequalities when acting with specific classes of feasible measurements , would be helpful to identify optimal resources for fully or partially device independent quantum communication using continuous variable systems .",
    "we hope the present work can serve as a stimulus to further progress in these directions .",
