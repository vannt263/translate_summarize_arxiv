    "the recent history of inverse compton emission from cosmic background photons and relativistic electrons ( ic/3k ) began during the period when the origin of extended x - ray emission from clusters of galaxies was unclear .",
    "felten and morrison ( 1966 ) , blumenthal & gould ( 1970 ) , and jones , odell & stein ( 1974 ) were among those who worked out the details of ic/3k , but not until iron lines were detected in the x - ray spectra was it generally accepted that the bulk of the x - ray emission was caused by the thermal bremsstrahlung process .",
    "although there were many attempts to isolate ic/3k emission from clusters , these were thwarted by the strong thermal emission which is quasi ubiquitous in clusters .",
    "the recent breakthrough came from the dual detections of ic/3k from the lobes of fornax a : spatially with the rosat pspc ( feigelson et al . 1995 ) and spectrally with asca ( kaneda et .",
    "al . 1995 ) . in the last two years",
    ", there have been papers published on other sources which are relatively free of hot gas emission and from cluster radio halos , both from euv excesses and from the harder spectral component at energies for which the thermal x - rays are dropping exponentially .",
    "in this section , we list a few of the attributes of ic/3k emission which are often overlooked .",
    "ic/3k emission is mandatory : every ( non - thermal ) radio source in the universe is an emitter .",
    "this statement entails only the assumption that the 3k background is indeed universal .",
    "thus the only problem is to see if it is strong enough for detection with a given system , and if it can be separated from other emissions .      at",
    "a given ( x - ray ) energy , we will be sampling the relativistic electron spectrum at the same value of electron energy ( @xmath0 ) for every source in the universe .",
    "this is because the peak frequency , @xmath1 , of the cosmic background spectrum ( where the major contribution to the photon energy density occurs ) increases as ( 1+z ) .",
    "a given electron with lorentz energy , @xmath0 , emits most of its radiation at @xmath2 and the emitted photons at that energy are redshifted by ( 1+z ) when observed on earth .",
    "thus soft x - rays ( 1 - 2 kev ) sample @xmath3  1000 no matter what the redshift .",
    "attempts to integrate these electrons in order to explain a significant part of the soft x - ray background have not been successful .      for b@xmath45@xmath5 g , low energy electrons ( e.g. @xmath61000 )",
    "are not visible via their synchrotron ( radio ) emission because the ionosphere blocks frequencies below @xmath7  20 mhz . since these electrons normally have long lifetimes in the weak magnetic fields typically found in extended radio sources , they accumulate over the life of a radio source . in a sense we are sampling an encapsulated history of the radio source :",
    "the electron spectrum at low energies tells us about all the electrons produced over the source s lifetime .",
    "* by going to higher energy : e.g. bepposax and rxte * by getting outside clusters : e.g. fornax a lobes and relic radio galaxies such as 0917 + 75 ( harris et .",
    "al . 1995 ) .",
    "* choose radio sources with large numbers of low energy electrons .",
    "this can be achieved by choosing sources likely to have relatively more low energy electrons and to have weak magnetic fields since these require more electrons to get a given radio intensity .",
    "therefore , steep spectrum , low brightness radio sources are best .",
    "although most of us like to believe that a successful detection of ic/3k yields the average magnetic field strength directly , what we really measure is the amplitude of the electron spectrum at some low energy . to obtain the average field strength , there is still the uncertainty of the form of the electron spectrum between the direct measurement afforded by the ic/3k observation and the segment of the electron spectrum responsible for the radio emission .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "since we ca nt be sure that a single power law extrapolates from the radio derived segment of the spectrum to the x - ray derived amplitude , the average value of b is uncertain ( even if the rosat point were not an upper limit ) .",
    "the electron spectrum below @xmath0=1000 is of particular interest because in weak field regions ( and z@xmath40.5 ) , e@xmath8 halflives can approach 10@xmath9  yr . therefore , the total number of electrons in this energy range serves as a diagnostic of the total energy of a source during its life .",
    "while soft x - rays ( e.g. 1.5 kev ) provide a direct measurement of the number of electrons at @xmath0=1000 , euve data can provide estimates at @xmath0=300 . in table 1",
    "we have calculated log  n ( 100@xmath101000 ) for a variety of radio sources by extrapolating their observed spectra to lower energies .",
    "* notes to table 2 * + luminosities are indicative ; the radio band was generally 10@xmath11 to 10@xmath12  hz ( except as noted below ) . the x - ray bands depend on the telescopes used .",
    "b(eq ) is the equipartition field ( filling factor of unity and no protons ) and b(ic ) is the field strength derived from the ic/3k measurements . both the original authors values ( a ) and those calculated from the equations in harris and grindlay ( 1979 ) [ rx ] are given",
    ".        entries are based on the composite radio spectrum presented by fusco - femiano et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; ff hereafter .",
    "the general properties of the radio spectrum of the halo were checked against earlier presentations .",
    "note however that whereas earlier work found @xmath13 around 1.2 to 1.3 , ff argue for curvature above 100 mhz , thus deducing a spectral break with an injection spectrum characterized by @xmath14=0.96 . for rx inputs ,",
    "we take the synchrotron band to be 30 - 630mhz , with a fiducial flux density of s(100mhz)=10 jy ( from their figure ) .",
    "the x - ray data are from bepposax ( ibid . ) .",
    "ff combine two detector results and make a spectral fit with two components ( thermal and a power law ) . for the power law , they get @xmath15 = 0.6@xmath160.4 . for the volume , we take the diameter used by ff : 25 ( 1 mpc ) .",
    "we used two papers : kaneda et al .",
    "( 1995 ) - asca spectral analysis ( `` keast '' and `` kwest '' ) , and feigelson et al . ( 1995)- spatial analysis from the rosat pspc .",
    "feigelson only did the west lobe ( `` fwest '' ) .",
    "this is a relic radio galaxy , somewhat obscured by the milky way .",
    "radio data are from mcadam ( 1991 ) and the x - ray data are from tashiro et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . since the x - ray data are for the entire source , and since the lobes are not the same size and brightness , we model an average lobe , taking the size , r=300 \" ( that of the s lobe ) , and divide both radio and x - ray fluxes by 2 ."
