    "<S> such metrics provide the setting for many interesting problems and investigations in geometric analysis and physics . </S>",
    "<S> it is known @xcite that if @xmath9 is ah , then there exists another boundary defining function @xmath18 such that , in a collar neighborhood of the boundary , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a smooth family of metrics on @xmath8 . then @xmath18 is called a _ special defining function _ for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the ` special metrics ' in this class are called poincar - einstein ( pe ) ; a more general class consists of the asymptotically poincar - einstein ( ape ) metrics , which are conformally compact and have an einstein tensor @xmath21 that vanishes near @xmath6 up to corrections of order @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are slight differences in this description depending on whether @xmath24 is even or odd . </S>",
    "<S> to simplify the discussion here , and also because it is our primary focus in this paper , we assume henceforth that @xmath24 is even .    </S>",
    "<S> the normalized ricci flow in this setting is the system of equations @xmath25 the normalization factor fixes the conformal infinity in time . </S>",
    "<S> pe metrics are the stationary points of this normalized ricci flow , but this flow also preserves the class of ape metrics @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> this is done by computing the volume of @xmath4 in the compact set @xmath27 , expanding the result in powers of @xmath28 ( there can also be @xmath29 terms when the bulk dimension @xmath24 is odd ) , and taking the limit at @xmath30 after discarding the singular terms in this expansion . </S>",
    "<S> while this may be done for any ah metric with a fixed special defining function @xmath18 , it turns out @xcite that this has an invariant meaning which is independent of the choice of @xmath18 provided @xmath9 satisfies an auxiliary condition concerning the omission of a certain number of odd terms in the expansion of the term @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , ( i ) @xmath31 must have an even expansion to order @xmath32 , and ( ii ) the first odd term in this expansion must have vanishing trace . </S>",
    "<S> we call ah metrics which satisfy condition ( i ) _ partially even_. partially even metrics that satisfy condition ( ii ) are called _ </S>",
    "<S> volume renormalizable_. thus we are asserting that ( when @xmath24 is even ) the renormalized volume of an ah metric @xmath9 has a well - defined , invariant meaning if and only if these conditions are satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> significantly , every even dimensional pe metric , as well as every even dimensional ape metric , satisfies these conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> ah metrics with various assumptions on the evenness of the expansion have been considered frequently before . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps most important is the appearance of this condition in geometric scattering theory . </S>",
    "<S> the paper @xcite by the second author and melrose established a general construction in the framework of what is now called geometric microlocal analysis for the resolvent of the scalar laplacian of an ah metric . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , it is proved there that the family of operators @xmath33 , which depends holomorphically on @xmath34 in the right half - plane @xmath35 , extends to a meromorphic function in the punctured plane @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> that analysis left open the possibility that there could be an accumulation of poles at this sequence of points along the ( shifted ) negative real axis . </S>",
    "<S> an important paper by guillarmou @xcite clarified the situation by showing that this accumulation does not happen precisely when the metric @xmath9 is even to all orders . </S>",
    "<S> this has many significant consequences for the scattering theory . </S>",
    "<S> this evenness condition has also appeared in the more recent and quite different approach by vasy @xcite for studying the meromorphic continuation of this resolvent family .    in our earlier paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we studied the behaviour of @xmath37 under ricci flow for an evolving family of ape metrics . </S>",
    "<S> our goal in this paper is to extend this analysis by studying this ricci evolution and its effect on the renormalized volume for the entire class of partially even metrics . </S>",
    "<S> the key difference between this larger class of metrics and the apes is that the coefficient tensors @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 in the expansion for @xmath41 are formally determined by the leading coefficient @xmath17 when @xmath9 is ape , whereas they are independent of one another when @xmath9 is partially even . </S>",
    "<S> the interrelationships between these tensors when @xmath9 is ape is precisely what forces the einstein tensor to vanish to order @xmath24 in that case , while for partially even metrics , the einstein tensor need only vanish to second order .    </S>",
    "<S> we now state our main theorems .    </S>",
    "<S> [ theorema ] suppose that @xmath42 , @xmath43 , is partially even , and let @xmath2 be a solution of with @xmath44 with maximal interval of existence @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath46 remains partially even for @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> this is proved in several steps . </S>",
    "<S> the first is to show that the ricci - deturck flow preserves the property of being partially even relative to a fixed defining function . </S>",
    "<S> this depends crucially on the earlier result by the first author @xcite that the ricci - deturck and ricci flows preserve the property of being conformally compact ( or polyhomogeneous ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then argue that the transformation which carries this to a solution of the ricci flow preserves the form of the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that the re - expression of @xmath2 relative to the appropriate special boundary defining function @xmath18 ( which depends on @xmath48 ) still preserves this form of the expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> our second main result computes the variation of the renormalized volume along this flow . </S>",
    "<S> we cast this slightly more generally by proving that the variation through volume renormalizable metrics of any curvature functional is just the renormalized first variation of the same form that , on compact manifolds , yields the euler - lagrange equations ( usually after integration by parts ) , see theorem [ thm : renorm - curv - fcl ] below . </S>",
    "<S> an immediate application is the    [ theoremb ] let @xmath42 , @xmath49 , be volume renormalizable , and @xmath2 the solution of with @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath50    here @xmath51 indicates that the integral is not classically convergent , but must be regularized in a way to be made precise below . </S>",
    "<S> the analogue of formula ( [ eq0.4 ] ) in @xcite appears almost exactly the same except that when @xmath2 is ape , the integral is convergent and there is no need to renormalize the integral .    </S>",
    "<S> there is recent work on the khler - ricci flow in the setting of asymptotically complex hyperbolic metrics . </S>",
    "<S> it is proved in @xcite that polyhomogeneity is preserved under this flow . </S>",
    "<S> there is an analogue of renormalized volume in this setting and it would be interesting to understand how our results could be carried over .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ fgofah ] </S>",
    "<S> we review the families of asymptotically hyperbolic metrics considered here and establish some of basic properties involving even expansions . in section [ peandrf ] </S>",
    "<S> we prove theorem [ theorema ] that the normalized ricci flow of a partially even metric remains partially even , and in section [ vrandrf ] we show that the volume renormalizability condition also persists under the ricci flow . </S>",
    "<S> we defer several long computations needed in this section to the appendix . finally in section [ varofcurvfcl ] we review the riesz renormalization and apply it to the variation of curvature functionals . we then prove theorem [ theoremb ] .      </S>",
