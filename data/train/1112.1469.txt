    "quantum theory is generally formulated relative to a given causal structure .",
    "this is the case both in quantum field theory , where the spacetime metric is given from the beginning , and in the operational framework of quantum information , where protocols and computations consist in sequences of operations performed at different times .",
    "relative to the given causal structure , quantum theory has to satisfy the _ causality principle _ @xcite , stating that the probability of a measurement outcome at a given time be independent of the choice of operations performed at later times .",
    "the causality principle forbids any form of signalling from the future to the past : a sender in the future can not deterministically transfer the state of his system to a receiver in the past .",
    "however , it is easy to imagine situations where the state of a system is transferred from the future to the past _ with some probability _ , without leading to signalling",
    ". this is what happens , for example , if we eliminate the communication of classical data in the original quantum teleportation protocol @xcite : the receiver in the past ( say , alice ) can prepare a maximally entangled state and the sender in the future ( say , bob ) can perform a bell measurement on the state to be teleported together with half of the entangled state , as in fig .

    "today alice prepares a maximally entangled two - qubit state @xmath3 of the ancilla and the output system , while tomorrow bob performs a measurement on the ancilla and his input qubit .",
    "the measurement has four possible outcomes , for one of which ( here denoted by @xmath4 ) successful teleportation will occur . with probability @xmath5 alice obtains bob s input state today .",
    "however , she will not know whether teleportation has been successful until bob performs his measurement and communicates the outcome . ]    in this way , upon observing the right measurement outcome , bob will know that the state has been teleported successfully to the past , and alice will not need to perform any correction operation on the output .",
    "of course , to know that teleportation has succeeded , bob needs to wait until he sees the outcome of the bell measurement .",
    "however , the important fact here is that , even before the measurement is performed , one half of the entangled state is already ready to be used by alice in a quantum circuit : alice can perform any desired computation on her system , and in the end , if teleportation is successful , bob will know that alice s computation has been performed on the input state he provided in the future . conditionally to the occurrence of the right outcome , everything behaves as though the input state has travelled from the future to the past through an ideal quantum channel . note",
    "that this fact is not in contradiction with causality : the probability of teleportation is small enough that no signal can be sent from bob to alice .",

    "probabilistic simulation of the identity channel from the future to the past_.    the idea of probabilistic teleportation as a simulated time - travel was originally proposed by bennett and schumacher in an unpublished work @xcite , and , more recently , by svetlichny @xcite . in different terms",
    ", this idea also appeared implicitly in the context of the graphical language of categorical quantum mechanics @xcite , where the reinterpretation of probabilistic teleportation as information flow from the future to the past follows from a stretching of wires in the basic teleportation diagram .",
    "interestingly , similar ideas also appeared in the work of horowitz and maldacena @xcite in the context of black hole evaporation , as an attempt to reconcile the unitarity of the black hole @xmath6-matrix with hawking s semiclassical arguments ( see also the discussion by gottesmann and preskill @xcite ) .",

    "de silva , galvao and kashefi @xcite showed that some patterns in measurement - based quantum computation can be interpreted as deterministic simulations of closed timelike curves .",
    "all the works mentioned so far focused on the use of teleportation for the probabilistic simulation of an ideal quantum channel from the future to the past . however , there are many interesting scenarios where one needs to consider the simulation of more general quantum channels . for example",
    ", suppose that we have @xmath0 identical copies of a the same state and that we want to teleport just one copy to the past .",
    "does the probability of success increase with the number if input copies ? and , if it does , what is the the asymptotic value of the success probability in the limit @xmath7 ? to answer these questions we have to address the probabilistic simulation of channels that trace all systems but one .",
    "in this paper we will address the general problem of the probabilistic simulation of a given channel from the future to the past , showing how the causality principle determines the maximum probability of success . to find the maximum probability we will optimize over all generalized teleportation schemes where a bipartite state is prepared and the input of the channel is jointly measured along with half of the bipartite state , so that , for a particular outcome , the desired channel is simulated , as in fig .",

    "the simulation will be successful : the effective transformation from input to output will be proportional to the desired quantum channel , with proportionality constant @xmath8 equal to the probability of successful simulation . ]",
    "the spirit of this work is similar to the spirit of the early works on the optimal cloning of non - orthogonal quantum states @xcite : in that case , one knew from the no - cloning theorem @xcite that it is impossible to produce perfect copies of the input state and the goal was to find the optimal physical process that approximates the impossible cloning transformation . in our case",
    ", we know from causality that it is impossible to have a channel that deterministically transfers information from the future to the past and our goal is to find the optimal process that achieves the desired channel with maximum probability of success .",
    "in the same way in which the study of optimal cloning shed light on the process of copying information in the quantum world , we expect that the study of optimal simulations of channels to the past will shed light the interplay between causal structure and quantum information flow .",
    "the main message of this paper is that the maximum probability of simulating a quantum channel from the future to the past is a decreasing function of the amount of information that the channel can transmit .",
    "this general feature will be illustrated in several examples .",

    "in the first case we find the maximum probability @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dimension of the hilbert space , while in the second case we find @xmath11 which is exactly the probability of the outcome that does not require correction operations in the original teleportation protocol @xcite .",
    "we will then focus on the probabilistic simulation of measure - and - prepare channels , which are a class of channels that transmit only classical information . in this case",
    ", we will find that the maximum probability of success is at least equal to the probability @xmath12 for a classical channel with the same output hilbert space .",
    "the exact value of the probability of success will be computed in two relevant cases of measure - and - prepare channels : the channel associated to the optimal estimation of a pure state , and the universal not channel @xcite .",
    "finally , we will analyze in detail the case of trace channels , sending @xmath0 copies of a given pure state to @xmath1 copies of the same state , and the case of universal cloning channels @xcite , sending @xmath0 copies of a pure state to @xmath13 optimal approximate copies . in both cases",
    "we find that the maximum probability of success is given by @xmath14 where @xmath10 is the dimension of the one - particle hilbert space and the superscript in @xmath15 reminds that we are restricting ourselves to the symmetric subspaces , in which the @xmath0 input copies and the @xmath16 output copies of the given pure state live . in the particular case of @xmath17 eq .",
    "( [ gennmbound ] ) yields the value @xmath18 which increases with the number of input copies , starting from @xmath19 and reaching the classical value @xmath20 in the asymptotic limit @xmath7 .",
    "this result has to be contrasted with the classical scenario , where having more input copies of a pure state can not lead to any improvement : since classical pure states can be perfectly cloned , there is no difference in having more input copies .",
    "the convergence of the probability of success to the classical value @xmath12 will be explained as a consequence of the convergence of the trace channel to a measure - and - prepare channel @xcite . concerning the probability @xmath21 in eq .",

    "we will explain the symmetry of the probabilities as a consequence of a _ time - reversal duality _ between trace and universal cloning .",
    "as we anticipated , the message emerging from our results is that the maximum probability for a given channel is a decreasing function of the amount of information that the channel can transmit : the smallest value @xmath24 corresponds to the identity channel , while measure - and - prepare channels have probability @xmath25 , and the erasure channels @xmath26 ~ \\rho_0 $ ] have probability @xmath27 .",
    "we will also make the connection more quantitative , providing a set of _ statistical information bounds _ , stating that the probability of success in the simulation of a channel is upper bounded by the inverse of the amount of information that the channel can transmit .",
    "the amount of information will be quantified here as the maximum payoff that two parties can achieve in a communication game .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section [ sec : general ] we present the general method and , in particular , the _ causality bound _ , a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a probabilistic simulation with probability @xmath8 .",
    "then , we will analyze the probabilistic simulation of several channels : sections [ sec : ideal ] , [ sec : measprep ] , and [ sec : opttele ] will focus on ideal classical and quantum channels , on measure - and - prepare channels , and on partial trace channels from @xmath0 to @xmath28 copies , respectively .",

    "this work showed how causality determines the maximum probability of simulating a given quantum channel from the future to the past . since causality states that it is not possible to signal from the future to the past",
    ", the probability of success in the simulation should be small enough to prevent any signal from being sent . as a consequence , channels that are able to transmit more",
    "information will have a smaller probability of being simulated , while channels that transmit less information will have a larger probability .",
    "in particular , erasure channels , that transmit no information at all , can be simulated with unit probability , while measure - and - prepare channels , that transmit only classical information , can be simulated with probability at least equal to @xmath430 the inverse of the output hilbert space dimension .",
    "the hardest channels to simulate are the ideal quantum channels , for which the probability is equal to @xmath431 , the inverse of the square of the hilbert space dimension .",
    "a quantitative connection between the amount of information transmitted by a channel and the probability of successful simulation is given by the statistical information bounds , which state that the probability of success is upper bounded by the inverse of the statistical information transmitted by the channel .",
    "in the paper we computed explicitly the maximum probability for the simulation of several channels , including partial trace channels from @xmath0 input systems to @xmath28 output systems , and universal cloning channels from @xmath0 input systems to @xmath432 output systems .",
    "we pointed out a time - reversal duality between trace and cloning and we exploited it to show that the value of the maximum probability of success is given by @xmath433 . note that for fixed @xmath16 , the probability of success is an increasing function of @xmath0 , the number of input copies .",
    "similarly , for fixed @xmath0 , the probability of success is an increasing function of @xmath16 , the number of output copies .",
    "these are genuinely quantum features , that are impossible in the classical world : indeed , classically the probability of success for all trace channels and for all cloning channels is given by @xmath434 , independently of @xmath0 and @xmath16 .    in the case of a single output copy",
    ", @xmath435 the probability of success for a quantum partial trace channel tends to the classical value @xmath434 in the limit of @xmath0 going to infinity .",
    "this asymptotic behaviour can be explained from the fact that a trace channel with asymptotically large number of input copies converges to a measure - and - prepare channel @xcite .",
    "the same explanation can be provided for the asymptotic behaviour of the probability of success for cloning channels .",
    "also in this case the asymptotic behaviour is dictated by the fact that a universal cloning channel with asymptotically large number of output copies converges to a measure - and - prepare channel @xcite .",
    "note that in this paper we focused on determining the maximum probability of success for many channels , but we did not show explicitly the generalized teleportation schemes that achieve the simulation of those channels . in particular , it is interesting to ask which kind of entangled states and which kind of measurements allow one to achieve teleportation from @xmath0 input copies to @xmath16 output copies .",
    "moreover , it is worth asking whether these probabilistic teleportation protocols can be extended to deterministic protocols ( now , from the past to the future ) by reintroducing classical communication and correction operations , as in the case of tele - cloning @xcite .",
    "the fact that the probability of successful teleportation from @xmath0 copies to @xmath17 copy converges to @xmath436 suggests that our probabilistic protocol could be extended to a deterministic protocol that needs only @xmath437 bits of classical communication , instead of the @xmath438 bits of the original teleportation protocol .",
    "however , it is quite possible that in general there exists a trade - off between maximizing the probability of success for a particular outcome and being able to implement a correction for all outcomes .",
    "all these issues will be investigated in a forthcoming work @xcite .",
    "another interesting direction of future research is to consider the simulation of multipartite channels under the constraint that different input and output systems can arrive at different instants of time , and to show how the probability of simulation depends on the possible causal arrangements of the input / output systems .",
    "for example , one could consider the case of a cloning channel from @xmath232 input copy to @xmath439 approximate copies , one copy being sent to the past and the other being sent to the future .",
    "examples of this kind are expected to shed light on the interplay between causal structure and quantum information flow .",
