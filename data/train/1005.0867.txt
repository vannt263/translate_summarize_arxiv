    "urn models play a central role in probability theory and combinatorics @xcite .",
    "since the balls can represent anything from atoms to biological organisms to humans , urn models are widely used in the physical , life , and social sciences @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the classic plya urn model @xcite .",
    "this urn process is a type of birth process , and it is useful for modeling the spread of infectious diseases , population dynamics , and evolutionary processes in biology @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this stochastic process is a branching process @xcite , and it is used to model data structures in computer science @xcite . from the myriad of other applications ,",
    "we mention decision making @xcite , reinforcement learning @xcite , and internet browser usage @xcite .",
    "we also note that the plya urn model is a limiting case of earlier urn models investigated by laplace @xcite , markov @xcite , and ehrenfest @xcite .",
    "the plya urn model exhibits rich and interesting phenomenology that includes strong influence of the initial conditions , large realization - to - realization fluctuations , and substantial finite - size corrections @xcite . in this study , we obtain the first passage properties @xcite of the plya urn model , and contrast these with the first passage characteristics of an ordinary random walk @xcite .    in the plya urn model , there are two types of balls , black and white . in a basic step ,",
    "one ball is selected randomly from all balls in the urn .",
    "this ball is then returned to the urn together with an additional ball of the same color .",
    "starting with a given configuration of balls , the number of balls increases indefinitely by repeating this step ad infinitum .",
    "thus , a configuration @xmath4 with @xmath5 black balls and @xmath6 white balls evolves according to @xmath7     region is equivalent to this trajectory reaching the diagonal ( broken line).,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    we investigate first passage properties of the urn process ( figure [ fig - urn ] ) .",
    "we find that the probability @xmath0 that a tie is reached , for the first time , when there are @xmath3 balls of each type decays algebraically @xmath8 for large @xmath3 .",
    "this asymptotic behavior holds for arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "we also show that the total exit probability , that is , the probability that a tie is ever reached , is less than one . hence , an initial imbalance in the number of balls can be locked in forever .",
    "we study how the total exit probability depends on the initial condition and find that it is appreciable only when the imbalance in the number of balls is of the order of square - root of the total number of balls .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we derive the first passage probability in section ii .",
    "we then obtain the exit probability by summing the first passage probability ( section iii ) .",
    "we discuss the extreme cases of nearly - maximal and extremely small exit probabilities ( sec .",
    "iv ) , and then use these limiting behaviors to establish scaling properties of the exit probability ( sec .",
    "we generalize the results to near - ties in section vi , and conclude in section vii .",
    "our goal is to quantify the first passage process , illustrated in figure [ fig - urn ] , using the first passage probability and the total exit probability . for the initial condition where , without loss of generality , black balls are in the majority , @xmath9 ,",
    "the first passage probability @xmath10 is the likelihood that a tie is reached , for the first time , when @xmath11 . in other words",
    "@xmath10 is the probability that the initial imbalance holds , @xmath12 , if and only if @xmath13 . the total exit probability @xmath14 is the probability that a tie is ever reached .    these first passage characteristics are of interest in a variety of contexts .",
    "for example , in growth of bacterial colonies @xcite , when bacteria proliferate without resource limitations , the exit probability measures the likelihood that the minority species eventually overtakes the majority species . in the context of a branching process , first passage statistics quantify the likelihood that two branches of a tree reach perfect balance .    as a preliminary step to finding the first passage probability ,",
    "we obtain the likelihood that the system reaches configuration @xmath15 starting from @xmath16 .",
    "let s consider , for example , the transition @xmath17 where one possible path is @xmath18 the likelihood of this path is @xmath19 there are @xmath20 distinct routes from @xmath21 to @xmath22 and they all have the same same probability .    in general , all paths from configuration @xmath23 to configuration @xmath24 have the same probability @xmath25\\cdot[w(w+1)\\cdots ( n-1)]}{(b+w)(b+w+1)\\cdots(m+n-1)}\\,.\\ ] ] we rewrite this probability using factorials @xmath26 the total number of distinct paths from @xmath23 to @xmath24 equals the binomial @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the transition probability @xmath28 that , starting from configuration @xmath23 , the system reaches configuration @xmath24 is @xcite @xmath29 in particular , the probability distribution is flat @xcite @xmath30 , for the initial condition @xmath31 .",
    "the number of paths from @xmath23 to @xmath32 that reach the diagonal @xmath33 only at the end point equals @xmath34 times the total number of such paths .",
    "this result can be established using the reflection principle @xcite .",
    "since all paths from @xmath23 to @xmath32 are equiprobable , the first passage probability is simply . by substituting @xmath35 into eq .",
    ", we obtain our first main result , the first passage probability @xmath36 this quantity decays algebraically , @xmath37 in the asymptotic limit @xmath38 .",
    "the proportionality constant in is @xmath39    for the special case @xmath40 , the first passage probability is simply @xmath41 the probability that a tie is ever reached equals the sum @xmath42 , and hence , there is a finite chance that the initial imbalance in the number of balls is maintained forever .",
    "this behavior is different than that of a one - dimensional random walk . in an ordinary random walk ,",
    "the two elementary transitions in occur with probability @xmath43 , and the first passage probability decays algebraically , @xmath44 , for large @xmath3 .",
    "yet , the exit probability equals one , and the random walk is guaranteed to reach the diagonal @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the one - dimensional random walk is recurrent , but the plya urn process is transient .",
    "the exit probability @xmath45 is the likelihood that starting from configuration @xmath23 , a tie happens by the time the urn contains @xmath1 balls .",
    "the exit probability follows from the first passage probability , @xmath46 the lower limit reflects that the quickest tie occurs when @xmath47 .",
    "we are especially interested in the total exit probability , @xmath48 . from the identity @xmath49 and equation",
    ", we conclude the asymptotic behavior @xmath50 when @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , the quantity that is the sum of , agrees with .",
    "to evaluate the total exit probability @xmath14 , we introduce the shorthand notation @xmath51 . with this notation , eq",
    ".   becomes , and @xmath52 which is obtained by substituting @xmath53 into .",
    "in particular , the quantity @xmath54 is the probability that a tie occurs as quickly as possible .    in terms of the quantities",
    "@xmath55 , the total exit probability @xmath56 equals @xmath57 we now evaluate the ratio of two consecutive first passage probabilities @xmath58 given these ratios , the exit probability can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function @xcite @xmath59 this closed form expression is our second main result . as expected , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we also note that the exit probability satisfies the compact recursion relation @xmath62 for all @xmath63 .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this recursion follows directly from the definition of the stochastic process , and is reminiscent of the recursion equation for an ordinary random walk @xcite .",
    "we use this recursion to analyze extremal properties of @xmath14 in the next section .",
    "intuitively , we expect that when @xmath64 is fixed , the exit probability increases monotonically with @xmath65 .",
    "the exit probability is largest when the number of balls is balanced , @xmath60 , and conversely , the exit probability is smallest when the initial imbalance is maximal , @xmath61 .",
    "we now discuss the extreme cases of very small and nearly - maximal exit probabilities , respectively .",
    "when @xmath66 , the exit probability decays exponentially with the total number of balls , @xmath67 to obtain this result , we note that when @xmath66 , two of the arguments of the hypergeometric function in coincide and hence , .",
    "we obtain the expression using the gauss identity for the hypergeometric function @xmath68 and the following two identities for the gamma function , , and .    by substituting @xmath69 into the recursion",
    ", we have @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , we obtain @xmath71 by substituting @xmath72 into . in general , the exit probability has the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a polynomial of degree @xmath75 in the variable @xmath64 . from equation ,",
    "these polynomials satisfy the recursion @xmath76 starting with the boundary condition , @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 since the coefficient of the dominant term in @xmath74 equals one , the exit probability decays exponentially with the total initial population @xmath79 when @xmath65 is finite and @xmath80 .    to analyze the behavior in the opposite limit of nearly - maximal exit probabilities , we consider the special case @xmath81 where the ratio simplifies as follows @xmath82 we now shift the index of the first passage probability by one , @xmath83 , with @xmath84 , and then evaluate the sum to find @xmath85 .",
    "further , we express the exit probability through gamma functions by using the identity , @xmath86 the exit probability increases monotonically with @xmath64 : @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , ties become practically certain , @xmath89 , in the limit @xmath90 .     versus the scaling variable @xmath91 . shown",
    "is the exit probability @xmath14 , evaluated using the exact expression , for three different values of @xmath92.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    along the same lines , we evaluate @xmath93 by substituting the form and the boundary condition @xmath60 into the recursion , @xmath94 from these examples , we conclude @xmath95 when @xmath96 is finite and @xmath90 . in other words , @xmath97 when the initial imbalance @xmath98 is fixed and the total number of balls @xmath99 diverges .",
    "we used the symmetry @xmath100 so that applies for both @xmath9 and @xmath101 .",
    "this equation implies that a tie is nearly certain whenever the initial discrepancy in the number of balls is much smaller than the square - root of the total number of balls .",
    "otherwise , the exit probability is substantially reduced .",
    "the asymptotic behavior suggests that the exit probability is function of a single variable when the total number of balls is very large .",
    "specifically , the scaling function @xmath102 , given by @xmath103 quantifies the exit probability in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "numerical evaluation of the exit probability confirms this scaling behavior ( figure [ fig - scaling ] ) .",
    "the scaling function is monotonically decreasing because a larger initial imbalance implies a smaller exit probability .",
    "the small argument behavior of the scaling function , @xmath105 , follows immediately from .",
    "the large argument behavior follows from the exponential behavior @xmath106 , see . indeed , when @xmath66 and @xmath64 is very large , the scaling variable is , and hence the tail of the scaling function must be gaussian , .",
    "numerical evaluation of the exact solution supports this heuristic prediction ( see figure [ fig - tail ] ) .    .",
    "shown is the scaling function @xmath102 versus @xmath107.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the scaling form implies that the likelihood of a tie is appreciable only when the initial population difference , @xmath108 , is of the same order as the square - root of the total population , @xmath92 , that is , @xmath109 a tie is nearly certain when the discrepancy is small , @xmath110 , but extremely rare when @xmath111 .",
    "there are a number of generalizations of the first passage process discussed above .",
    "two natural questions are : ( i ) what is the probability that the _ ratio _ between the majority population and the majority population is always above a fixed threshold and ( ii ) what is the probability that the _ difference _ between the two populations is always above a fixed threshold . in this section ,",
    "we address the latter problem .",
    "we define @xmath112 to be the first passage probability that starting with configuration @xmath23 , the difference if and only if @xmath13 .",
    "in other words @xmath112 is the probability that there are at least @xmath113 more black balls throughout the evolution and moreover , this condition is violated for the first time when @xmath114 .",
    "we obtain the first passage probability @xmath115 by multiplying the probability for transitioning from @xmath23 to @xmath116 with the fraction @xmath117 of these paths that do not cross the line @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "of course , this expression matches when @xmath119 . again",
    ", the asymptotic behavior in the limit @xmath120 is @xmath2 .",
    "the exit probability @xmath121 is the probability that the line @xmath118 is reached at least once during the evolution . by repeating the steps leading to",
    ", we find the exit probability in terms of a higher - order hypergeometric function @xmath122 the corresponding arguments are @xmath123    for near - ties , @xmath124 , there are many similarities with @xmath14 of eq .  .",
    "for example , the exit probability decays exponentially when the initial imbalance is maximal , @xmath125 additionally , the exit probability is close to one when the initial imbalance is minimal , @xmath126 thus , the behavior @xmath127 is recovered when @xmath90 .",
    "in summary , we obtained first passage characteristics of the plya urn process as a function of the initial condition .",
    "the first passage probability that a tie is reached for the first time when there are @xmath1 balls decays algebraically , @xmath2 , for large @xmath3 .",
    "the probability that a tie ever occurs , is less than one , hence ties are not certain .",
    "this exit probability decreases as the initial discrepancy in the number of balls increases .",
    "moreover , there is a universal scaling behavior when the total initial population is very large .",
    "this scaling behavior implies that the exit probability is appreciable only when the initial population imbalance is of the order of the square - root of the total population .",
    "the key property of the plya urn model is that the fraction of white balls approaches a limiting value , but this value fluctuates from realization - to - realization . in many other urn models ,",
    "however , the opposite is true , and moreover , the two fractions approach the same limiting value .",
    "this is the case for the friedman urn process @xcite which , in its simplest form , is equivalent to the stochastic process @xmath128 it will be interesting to investigate first passage properties of this urn process .",
    "we conjecture that first passage statistics are much closer to those of the ordinary random walk .    in the context of population dynamics and evolutionary biology , continuous time processes are more appropriate .",
    "the continuous time analog of the plya urn model is the two - species branching process , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , where the two birth rates are equal .",
    "this continuous time process is closely related to the discrete time urn process .",
    "for instance , the total exit probabilities for the two processes are _"
