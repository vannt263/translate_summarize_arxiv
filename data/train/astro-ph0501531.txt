    "cosmological observations have started to provide valuable upper limits on absolute neutrino masses ( see , e.g. , the reviews @xcite ) , competitive with those from laboratory experiments .",
    "in particular , the combined analysis of high - precision data from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and large scale structures ( lss ) has already reached a sensitivity of @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) for the sum of the neutrino masses @xmath1 , @xmath2 we recall that the total neutrino energy density in our universe , @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the hubble constant normalized to @xmath5 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 ) is related to @xmath1 by the well - known relation @xmath7 @xcite , and plays an essential role in theories of structure formation .",
    "it can thus leave key signatures in lss data ( see , eg.,@xcite ) and , to a lesser extent , in cmb data ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) . very recently",
    ", it has also been shown that accurate lyman-@xmath8 ( ly@xmath8 ) forest data @xcite , taken at face value , can improve the current cmb+lss constraints on @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath9 , with important consequences on absolute neutrino mass scenarios@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , atmospheric , solar , reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments have convincingly established that neutrinos are massive and mixed .",
    "world neutrino data are consistent with a three - flavor mixing framework ( see @xcite and references therein ) , parameterized in terms of three neutrino masses @xmath10 and of three mixing angles @xmath11 , plus a possible cp violating phase @xmath12 .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments are sensitive to two independent squared mass difference , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) , hereafter defined as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 fixes the absolute neutrino mass scale , while the cases @xmath18 and @xmath19 identify the so - called normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies , respectively .",
    "neutrino oscillation data indicate that @xmath20 ev@xmath21 and @xmath22 ev@xmath21 .",
    "they also indicate that @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "however , they are currently unable to determine the mass hierarchy ( @xmath26 ) and the phase @xmath12 , and are insensitive to the absolute mass parameter @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ deltadef ] ) .",
    "the absolute neutrino mass scale can also be probed by non - oscillatory neutrino experiments .",
    "the most sensitive laboratory experiments to date have been focussed on tritium beta decay and on neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "beta decay experiments probe the so - called effective electron neutrino mass @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28^\\frac{1}{2}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "current experiments ( mainz @xcite and troitsk @xcite ) provide upper limits in the range @xmath31  ev @xcite .",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath32 ) experiments are instead sensitive to the so - called effective majorana mass @xmath33 ( if neutrinos are majorana fermions ) , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 parameterize relative ( and unknown ) majorana neutrino phases @xcite .",
    "all @xmath32 experiments place only upper bounds on @xmath33 ( the most sensitive being in the ev range , with the exception of the heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite , which claims a positive ( but highly debated ) @xmath32 signal @xmath37 ev at @xmath38 c.l . and corresponding to @xmath33 in the sub - ev range at best fit @xcite .    in these proceedings",
    ", we will briefly illustrate the impact of the cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses on the three - flavor mixing theoretical and observational scenario .",
    "the neutrino contribution to the overall energy density of the universe can play a relevant role in large scale structure formation and leave key signatures in several cosmological data sets . more specifically , neutrinos suppress the growth of fluctuations on scales below the horizon when they become non relativistic .",
    "a massive neutrinos of a fraction of ev would therefore produce a significant suppression in the clustering on small cosmological scales ( namely , for comoving wavenumber @xmath39 ) .    to constrain @xmath1 from cosmological data ,",
    "we perform a likelihood analysis comparing the recent observations with a set of models with cosmological parameters sampled as follows : cold dark matter ( cdm ) density @xmath40 $ ] in steps of @xmath41 ; baryon density @xmath42 $ ] ( motivated by big bang nucleosynthesis ) in steps of @xmath43 ; a cosmological constant @xmath44 $ ] in steps of @xmath45 ; and neutrino density @xmath46 $ ] in steps of @xmath47 .",
    "we restrict our analysis to _ flat _ @xmath48-cdm models , @xmath49 , and we add a conservative external prior on the age of the universe , @xmath50 gyrs .",
    "the value of the hubble constant in our database is not an independent parameter , since it is determined through the flatness condition .",
    "we adopt the conservative top - hat bound @xmath51 and we also consider the @xmath52 constraint on the hubble parameter , @xmath53 , obtained from hubble space telescope ( hst ) measurements  @xcite .",
    "we allow for a reionization of the intergalactic medium by varying the cmb photon optical depth @xmath54 in the range @xmath55 $ ] in steps of @xmath45 .",
    "we restrict the analysis to adiabatic inflationary models with a negligible contribution of gravity waves .",
    "we let vary the spectral index @xmath56 of scalar primordial fluctuations in the range @xmath57 $ ] and its running @xmath58 $ ] assuming pivot scales at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we rescale the fluctuation amplitude by a prefactor @xmath61 , in units of the value @xmath62 measured by the wilkinsin microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite .",
    "finally , concerning the neutrino parameters , we fix the number of neutrino species to @xmath63 , all with the same mass ( the effect of mass differences compatible with neutrino oscillation being negligible in the current cosmological data @xcite ) . an higher number of neutrino species can weakly affect both cmb and lss data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) but is highly constrained by standard big bang nucleosynthesis and is not considered in this work , where we focus on @xmath64 mixing .",
    "the cosmological data we considered comes from observation of cmb anisotropies and polarization , galaxy redshift surveys and luminosity distances of type ia supernovae . for the cmb data we use the recent temperature and cross polarization results from the wmap satellite @xcite using the method explained in @xcite and the publicly available code .",
    "given a theoretical temperature anisotropy and polarization angular power spectrum in our database , we can therefore associate a @xmath65 to the corresponding theoretical model .",
    "we further include the latest results from other cmb datasets .",
    "the cmb data analysis methods have been already described in @xcite and will not be reported here .",
    "in addition to the cmb data we also consider the real - space power spectrum of galaxies from either the 2 degrees fields ( 2df ) galaxy redshifts survey or the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , using the data and window functions of the analysis of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we restrict the analysis to a range of scales over which the fluctuations are assumed to be in the linear regime ( @xmath66 ) . when combining with the cmb data , we marginalize over a bias @xmath67 for each data set considered as an additional free parameter .",
    "we also include information from the ly@xmath8 forest in the sdss , using the results of the analysis of @xcite and @xcite , which probe the amplitude of linear fluctuations at very small scales .",
    "for this data set , small - scale power spectra are computed at high redshifts and compared with the values presented in @xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", we do not consider running .",
    "we finally incorporate constraints obtained from the sn - ia luminosity measurements of @xcite using the so - called gold data set .",
    "luminosity distances at sn - ia redshifts are computed for each model in our database and compared with the observed apparent bolometric sn - ia luminosities . in fig .  1 we plot the likelihood distribution for @xmath1 from our joint analysis of cmb  +  sn - ia  +  hst  +  lss data , transformed into an equivalent @xmath68 function , which allows to derive bounds on @xmath1 at any fixed confidence level .",
    "we take lss data either from the sdss or the 2df survey ( dashed and solid curves , respectively ) .",
    "as we can see , these curves do not show evidence for a neutrino mass ( the best fit being at @xmath69 ) and provide the @xmath70 bound @xmath71 ev .",
    "such bound is in good agreement with previous results in similar analyses @xcite .",
    "also plotted in fig .",
    "1 is the @xmath68 function from a joint analysis of cmb  +  sn - ia  +  hst  +  2df  +  ly@xmath8 .",
    "no running is assumed in this analysis , and we find a @xmath70 bound @xmath72 ev , in very good agreement ( despite the more approximate method we used ) with the analysis already presented in @xcite .    as shown in fig .  1 and already discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the inclusion of the ly@xmath8 data from the sdss set greatly improves the constraints on @xmath1 .",
    "upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses @xmath1 from our @xmath64 analysis of cosmological data , given in terms of the @xmath68 function .",
    "the solid and dashed curves refer to the combination of cmb and lss data ( cmb+2df and cmb+sdss , respectively ) .",
    "the two cmb+lss fits provide comparable results and , for definiteness , the cmb+2df one is adopted .",
    "in addition , we consider also the case where the recent ly@xmath8 data from the sdss are included , providing significantly stronger constraints on @xmath1 ( dotted curve ) .",
    "see @xcite for details.,width=226 ]     global @xmath64 analysis in the @xmath73 parameter space , using oscillation data plus laboratory data and cosmological data .",
    "this figure implements also upper limits ( shown as dashed lines at @xmath70 level ) on @xmath27 from mainz+troitsk data , on @xmath33 from @xmath32 data , and on @xmath1 from cmb+2df+ly@xmath8 data . in combination with oscillation parameter bounds , the cosmological upper limit on @xmath1 dominates over the laboratory upper limits on @xmath27 and @xmath33 .",
    "see @xcite for details.,width=226 ]",
    "here we consider confidence regions obtained from analysis of neutrino oscillation data , of @xmath27 and @xmath33 data and cosmological cmb+lss data ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "figure  2 shows such regions projected in the three coordinate planes .",
    "separate laboratory and cosmological upper bounds at the @xmath70 level are shown as dashed lines , while the regions allowed by the combination of laboratory , cosmological , and oscillation data are shown as thick solid curves for normal hierarchy and as thin solid curves for inverted hierarchy .",
    "it can be seen that the upper bounds on the @xmath74 observables are dominated by the cosmological upper bound on @xmath1 .",
    "this bound , via the @xmath75 and @xmath76 correlations induced by oscillation data , provides upper limits also on @xmath33 and @xmath27 , which happen to be stronger than the current laboratory limits by a factor @xmath77 .    since significant improvements on laboratory limits for @xmath33 and @xmath27 will require new experiments and several years of data taking @xcite , cosmological determinations of @xmath1 , although indirect , will continue to provide , in the next future , the most sensitive upper limits ( and hopefully a signal ) for absolute neutrino mass observables .    in fig .",
    "2 , the tension ( at @xmath70 ) between the limits from cosmology and the lower limit on @xmath78 ev claimed by the heidelberg - moscow experiment is a clear symptom of possible problems , either in some data sets or in their theoretical interpretation , which definitely prevent any global combination of data",
    ". it would be premature to conclude that , e.g. , the @xmath32 claim is``ruled out '' by cosmological data but it is anyway exciting that global neutrino data analyses have already reached a point where fundamental questions may start to arise .    _ acknowledgements _ a.m. would like to thank the organizers of the _ now-2004 _ workshop .",
