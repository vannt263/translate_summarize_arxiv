    "the non - linear wave equation ( sometimes called the non - linear klein - gordon equation ) @xmath0 models various systems . for instance , taking @xmath1 , gives the sine - gordon equation , @xmath2 which describes various physical and biological systems , including molecular systems , dislocation of crystals and dna processes  @xcite .",
    "as an illustrative example : the sine - gordon equation is a fundamental model for long josephson junctions , two superconductors sandwiching a thin insulator  @xcite . in the case of josephson junctions ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath3 represents the josephson tunnelling critical current . in an ideal uniform josephson junction , this is a constant .",
    "but if there are magnetic variations , e.g. because of non - uniform thickness of the width of the insulator or if the insulator is comprised of materials with different magnetic properties next to each other , then the josephson tunnelling critical current  @xmath3 will vary with the spatial variable  @xmath4 , leading to an inhomogeneous potential @xmath5 . if there is a defect in the form of a scratch or local thickening in the insulator then we model the inhomogeneity by a step function @xmath6 , with @xmath7 outside the defect and @xmath8 inside , see  @xcite and references therein .    to make it easier to generalise this example to more general wave equations , we write the model for a josephson junction with one inhomogeneity as an equation on the disjoint open intervals @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is a constant damping coefficient and the potential @xmath15 consists of three smooth ( @xmath16 ) functions @xmath17 , defined on three disjoint open intervals  @xmath18 of the real spatial axis , such that @xmath12 . without loss of generality , we can write @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for some @xmath22 , by translating the @xmath4 variable so that the origin occurs at the centre of the middle interval .",
    "so , the length of the inhomogeneity or ` defect ' is @xmath23 . in this paper",
    "we study this equation in its generality , as well as the motivating example of josephson junctions .",
    "the existence and stability of stationary fronts or solitary waves ( from now on we shall simply refer to both of these as stationary fronts ) of is studied in  @xcite . in particular , spectral stability of the stationary fronts ( which in this case implies non - linear stability ,",
    "see  @xcite and references therein ) is studied and a necessary and sufficient criterion is developed for the spectral operator to have an eigenvalue zero .",
    "the spectral operator can be related to a self - adjoint linearisation operator such that @xmath24 is an eigenvalue of the spectral operator if and only if @xmath25 is an eigenvalue of the self - adjoint operator .",
    "the self - adjoint operator has real eigenvalues and a continuous spectrum on the negative half line bounded away from zero .",
    "so as the largest eigenvalue passes through zero a change of stability occurs .",
    "the self - adjoint operator is a sturm - liouville operator , which implies that the discrete eigenvalues are simple and bounded above .",
    "it also means that the eigenfunction associated with the largest discrete eigenvalue will have no zeroes , providing a tool to identify the largest eigenvalue . in",
    "@xcite a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an eigenvalue zero is derived , but this is only a necessary condition for a change of stability .",
    "the proof in  @xcite contains the construction of an eigenfunction and hence the absence of zeroes can be checked to verify that the eigenvalue zero is the largest eigenvalue . but to guarantee a change of stability , one also needs verification that the largest eigenvalue crosses through zero . in this paper",
    "we will consider this crossing question and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the change of stability of a stationary front .    as this paper builds on  @xcite",
    ", we start with a brief introduction to the relevant notation and results from this paper . stationary fronts of   are solutions of the hamiltonian ode @xmath26 which satisfy @xmath27 exponentially fast for @xmath28 .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath29 , then the hamiltonian @xmath30 is constant on each of the intervals @xmath18 , @xmath31 . in the middle interval , we define the hamiltonian parameter @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "writing @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the values of @xmath36 at the boundaries between the different intervals ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the values of @xmath41 at the same values of @xmath4 , the matching conditions at the boundaries give that @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be parametrised by @xmath44 : @xmath45 here @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the asymptotic values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively , that is @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "these limits are well defined as @xmath52 is a front .",
    "the relations in   might lead to multi - valued functions @xmath34 , etc . however , usually they are locally well - defined , except potentially at some isolated bifurcation points . to find those points , we define the following bifurcation functions @xmath53 , \\\\ { \\mathop{\\mathscr{b}_r}}(g)&=&{{p_r}}(g)[v_r'({u_r}(g))-v_{m}'({u_r}(g))].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a bifurcation occurs if @xmath44 satisfies @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "we define the bifurcation values @xmath56 to be any value of @xmath44 ( if it exists ) where @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "these points are usually associated with the edge of the existence interval .",
    "finally , the fundamental theorem of calculus enables the length of the middle interval to be parametrised by the hamiltonian parameter @xmath44 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath57 has no zeroes in the middle interval then @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the values of @xmath36 where the front @xmath61 enters resp .",
    "leaves the middle interval . if @xmath57 has zeroes in the middle interval than the expression for @xmath62 is more complicated but it can still be expressed explicitly , see  @xcite .",
    "now we can formulate the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an eigenvalue zero from  @xcite .",
    "[ oldtheo ] let the front @xmath63 be a solution of , such that all zeroes of @xmath64 are simple and the length of the middle interval of @xmath63 is part of a smooth length curve @xmath62 .",
    "the linearisation operator @xmath65 , associated with @xmath63 has an eigenvalue zero ( with eigenfunction in @xmath66 ) if and only if @xmath67 if @xmath68 , then there is an eigenvalue zero ( with eigenfunction in @xmath66 ) if and only if @xmath69 .    as the linear operator",
    "@xmath70 is a sturm - liouville operator , the eigenvalues are simple and bounded above , meaning that away from the bifurcation points , the curves of eigenvalues , @xmath71 are well - defined and continuous .",
    "thus if there exists an eigenvalue zero for @xmath72 , and the associated eigenfunction @xmath73 has no zeroes ( this eigenfunction is constructed in the proof of theorem  [ oldtheo ] , see @xcite ) , then a change of stability ( both spectral and non - linear ) _ may _ occur as @xmath44 passes from one side of @xmath74 to the other . whether or not the change of stability will _ actually _ happen , depends on the degree of the zero of the largest eigenvalue @xmath71 at @xmath75 .",
    "specifically , the largest eigenvalue may be strictly negative , touch zero for some value of @xmath44 and then become strictly negative again , i.e. the eigenvalue @xmath71 may have a non - simple zero and the front is stable for all @xmath44 , see the left panel of figure  [ partiiturningevalue ] .        in the examples in  @xcite ,",
    "no eigenvalues of this type were encountered ; in all cases , the presence of an eigenvalue zero also led to a change of the sign in this eigenvalue .",
    "thus the eigenvalue , as a function of @xmath44 , locally looked like the right panel of figure  [ partiiturningevalue ] .",
    "this suggested that this would always be the case for the inhomogeneous non - linear wave equation  .",
    "however this suggestion is false .    in the next section",
    "we shall present an example where the length function @xmath62 has an inflection point . from  theorem  [ oldtheo ]",
    "it follows that an inflection point of the length function @xmath62 must correspond to an eigenvalue zero .",
    "we will show that in this example the inflection point of @xmath62 corresponds to a non - simple root of the eigenvalue @xmath71 and that a change of stability does not occur as @xmath44 moves from one side of @xmath74 to the other , see figure  [ infleclength ] .",
    "this result is generalised in section  [ sec.sc ] , leading to a necessary and sufficient condition for a change of stability . in section  [ sec.evans ] ,",
    "the evans function is used to show that if @xmath76 times the product of the signs of the derivative of the front near its end points is positive , then the front is unstable . combined with the results of section  [ sec.sc ] , this implies that the stable branch is the branch for which the product is negative . to complete our exposition , in section  [ sec.multiple ]",
    ", we consider the wave equation with multiple middle intervals .",
    "it will be shown that the criterion for a wave equation with one middle interval can be used to derive a sufficient and necessary condition for a change of stability in such systems .",
    "in this section we present an example in which the potential in the inhomogeneous wave equation   is such that the length curve @xmath62 has an inflection point at which no change of stability occurs .",
    "this example involves a one parameter family of potentials , leading to a two parameter curve of length curves ( the hamiltonian parameter  @xmath44 and the parameter for the potentials ) .",
    "we will use the full family to make inferences about the stability of various branches of @xmath62 and hence to show that the inflection point in the length curve does not correspond to a change of stability .",
    "finally we illustrate the inferences that we made by confirming the prediction that there is a region in the parameter space related to the potential , for which there is bi - stable behaviour .",
    "the example we consider has the sine - gordon potential ( with induced current and dissipation ) in the left and right intervals ( @xmath77 ) and has a potential of the form @xmath78 in the middle interval ( @xmath79 ) , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are parameters .",
    "that is , we consider stationary fronts of the following equation @xmath82 the stationary fronts join the steady states @xmath83 as @xmath84 and @xmath85 as @xmath86 . in figure",
    "[ clength ] , typical length curves @xmath62 are plotted for various values of @xmath81 between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , while @xmath89 and @xmath80 are kept fixed at @xmath90 and @xmath91 . recall that @xmath44 represents the hamiltonian in the middle interval , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
    "the value of @xmath93 is not relevant for the existence of stationary fronts nor for the length curve .",
    "it only comes into play once the ( linear ) stability of the stationary fronts is considered .",
    "however , for all values of @xmath14 , the front is either always stable or always unstable . for @xmath94 ,",
    "the stable fronts are neutrally stable ( purely imaginary eigenvalues in the linearisation ) . while for @xmath95 , the same fronts are now attractors .",
    "figure  [ clength ] illustrates that there are qualitative changes in the length curves when @xmath81 is varied .",
    "this qualitative change effects the number of turning points of @xmath62 , changing from one to three and back to one again as @xmath81 is varied .",
    "we show this sketch for @xmath91 as it provides the full picture of what happens as @xmath81 is varied . for smaller @xmath80 some of these panels ( right most ones )",
    "are not seen due to a restricted @xmath44 existence interval .",
    "we have included the stability of the various branches of @xmath62 in figure  [ clength ] .",
    "the stability of the two branches for smallest and largest values of @xmath81 are found by numerical simulations with @xmath96 for one solution on each of the branches .",
    "theorem  [ oldtheo ] gives that an eigenvalue zero can only occur at turning or inflection points of @xmath62 , hence on one branch the stability can not change .",
    "the stability profiles for the other panels are then inferred from these two panels , using the fact that @xmath97 is continuous in  @xmath81 , hence @xmath22 will be continuous in  @xmath81 .",
    "for example , to get the stability of the branches for the second image from the left , note that the inflection point occurs away from the turning point so the stability of the branches in the locale of the turning point can not change ( no eigenvalues have crossed zero for @xmath44 in the neighbourhood of the turning point ) .",
    "furthermore , the stability at the outer parts of the branches ( largest and smallest values of @xmath44 ) can not change as @xmath98 at the outer parts .",
    "therefore the only possibility for the stability of the branches is as shown in this second panel and hence the stability does nt change at the inflection point ( as @xmath44 is varied and @xmath81 is kept fixed ) .",
    "a similar argument can be used for the second image on the right .",
    "now the stability in the middle images follows from matching the outer panels on the left and right .",
    "going from the second to the third image from the left , continuity does not provide any conclusion about the stability of the third branch in first instance .",
    "similarly we do nt know the stability of the second branch in the third picture on the right .",
    "however , by comparing these two images and using continuity , we can conclude the stability of these branches .    to illustrate the inferences about the stability of the various branches",
    ", we observe that figure  [ clength ] suggests that there are values of @xmath81 with two stable stationary fronts .",
    "it is easier to visualise this bi - stable behaviour for smaller values of @xmath80 , so we focus on @xmath99 . recall that this change in @xmath80 has the effect of removing some of the panels ( from the right ) in figure  [ clength ] . for @xmath99 and @xmath90 , there is an inflection point on the right branch when @xmath100 . if @xmath101 ( and @xmath99 , @xmath90 ) then the length curve has three turning points , see figure  [ fig.3 ] ,        and for @xmath102 there are four stationary fronts , two of which are stable . in the left panel of figure  [ fig.4 ]",
    "we show the four stationary fronts for @xmath102 .",
    "the red non - monotonic front corresponds to the right most branch in figure  [ fig.3 ] .",
    "the fact that two of the fronts are stable is confirmed by simulating equation  , starting with different initial conditions , see the middle and right panels of figure  [ fig.4 ] .",
    "the initial conditions used are the ( unique ) stable front for a slightly larger length value ( @xmath103 ) , which converges to the stable non - monotonic stationary front ( right plot ) .",
    "and the other initial condition is the stationary front solution to the sine - gordon equation , which converges to the other stable front ( middle plot ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that the non - monotonic stationary front is indeed stable .",
    "this simulation also confirms the inference that no change of stability occurs at the inflection point . in the next section",
    "we will show that this is generically true .",
    "in the example of the previous section we saw an inflection point of the length function @xmath62 which corresponded to a non - simple zero of the eigenvalue function @xmath71 . that is : at the inflection point @xmath104 , it holds that @xmath105 and also @xmath106 .",
    "here we see a hint of the relationship between the order of a zero of @xmath107 and the order of the corresponding zero of @xmath71 .",
    "we make this explicit in the following lemma .",
    "[ hyslem ] away from the bifurcation point @xmath56 , the order of a zero of @xmath71 is the same as the order of the associated stationary point of @xmath62 .",
    "for instance if @xmath62 has a stationary point at @xmath72 , with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , then @xmath74 is a second order root of @xmath71 ( i.e. , @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) and visa verse .",
    "let @xmath62 have a stationary point at @xmath75 , then theorem  [ oldtheo ] implies that the linearisation operator @xmath112 associated with the front @xmath113 has an eigenvalue @xmath114",
    ".    as a thought experiment ( motivated by the previous section ) , consider smooth perturbations of the potential @xmath115 which have the effect of perturbing the associated @xmath62 curve .",
    "the perturbation may lead to a change in the number of stationary points of @xmath62 ( in the locality of @xmath74 ) . as it is perturbations of the potentials which cause this change in @xmath62 , theorem  [ oldtheo ] still holds , meaning that the stationary points of @xmath62 are still associated with zeroes of @xmath71 .",
    "thus the original curve @xmath71 will be smoothly perturbed in such a way that it has the same number of zeroes as the perturbed curve @xmath62 has stationary points . away from any bifurcation points ( @xmath56 ) , a smooth perturbation of @xmath115 leads to a smooth perturbation of @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath62 has a turning point of first order at @xmath75 , then any small smooth perturbation will lead to @xmath62 still having exactly one turning point ( in the locality of @xmath74 ) .",
    "similarly , if @xmath71 has a simple zero ( right panel in figure  [ partiiturningevalue ] ) then any smooth perturbation to @xmath71 will still ( locally ) have one zero .",
    "whilst if @xmath71 has a second order zero ( left panel in figure  [ partiiturningevalue ] ) a small smooth perturbation would generically result in either no zeroes of @xmath71 or in two zeroes of @xmath71 , which is not consistent with a first order turning point of @xmath62 .",
    "thus we can conclude that a first order turning point of @xmath62 can not be not associated with a second order zero of @xmath71 , and similarly , it can not be associated with an even order zero of @xmath71 .    to make those ideas formal , we embed the middle potential @xmath115 smoothly in a larger family @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is a small parameter and @xmath118 . for @xmath117 small and @xmath44 near @xmath74",
    ", this embeds the family of fronts @xmath63 in the family @xmath119 with associated length curves @xmath120 and the eigenvalue @xmath121 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the length @xmath62 is the sum of integrals of the form @xmath122 .",
    "hence the embedding @xmath116 can be chosen such that @xmath123 implying that @xmath124 to see this inequality , differentiating the eigenvalue equation @xmath125\\psi(g_0,\\epsilon)=0 $ ] with respect to @xmath117 , evaluating at @xmath126 , and taking the @xmath127 inner product with the eigenfunction @xmath128 shows that @xmath129\\ , \\psi(g_0,0 ) \\,,\\ , \\psi(g_0,0)\\right\\rangle_{l_2}=0.\\ ] ] hence the second inequality in   implies that @xmath130 .    from theorem  [ oldtheo ] we know that @xmath131 . to see that this implies that the order of the critical point of @xmath62 and the order of the zero of @xmath71 is the same at @xmath75 , we start with showing the existence of a curve of critical points @xmath132 with @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "first we consider the non - degenerate case : if @xmath135 and @xmath136 then the taylor series for @xmath137 about @xmath138 is @xmath139 since @xmath140 , the implicit function theorem gives that there exist a unique curve @xmath132 for @xmath117 near zero such that @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "differentiating @xmath141 with respect to @xmath117 and evaluating at @xmath126 gives @xmath143 since @xmath133 , theorem  [ oldtheo ] gives that @xmath144 too . differentiating this expression with respect to @xmath117 and evaluating at @xmath126 shows @xmath145 and we can conclude that @xmath74 is a first order zero of the eigenvalue @xmath71 , hence a first order turning point of @xmath62 is associated with a simple zero of @xmath71 .",
    "next we consider the higher order critical points of @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath146 be the smallest value ( @xmath147 ) such that @xmath148 , that is @xmath149 for @xmath150 .",
    "then a taylor series gives @xmath151 in order to be able to apply the implicit function theorem and get a smooth curve of critical points @xmath152 , we replace @xmath117 with the new variable @xmath153 such that @xmath154 if @xmath146 is even , then we restrict @xmath117 to only positive or only negative values .",
    "however , @xmath153 is allowed to have both positive and negative values .",
    "we define @xmath155 now the implicit function theorem gives that there exist a unique curve @xmath156 for @xmath153 near zero such that @xmath157 and @xmath158 , hence @xmath159 .",

    "that @xmath161 . differentiating this expression @xmath146 times with respect to @xmath153 and evaluating at @xmath162 , gives that for @xmath163 @xmath164",

    "lemma  [ hyslem ] equates the order of zeroes of @xmath107 with the order of zeroes of @xmath71 .",

    "now we have characterised the fronts at which a change of stability will occur , a next question is how the stable and unstable branch can be identified . due to translational symmetry ,",
    "evolutionary homogeneous hamiltonian wave equations like the sine - gordon equation , the nonlinear schrodinger ( nls ) equation or the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation have families of solitary wave solutions , which can be characterised as constrained critical points of the hamiltonian on level sets of the generalised momentum , i.e , the constant of motion associated with the translational symmetry . for such equations ,",
    "the orbital ( in)stability of the solitary waves can be associated with the slope of the momentum - velocity curve . for the nls equation",

    "an eigenvalue @xmath169 will exist if the stable subspace for @xmath170 intersects with the unstable subspace for @xmath84 .",
    "the angle between those two subspaces is measured by the evans function , a wronskian - like analytic function of  @xmath169 .",
    "the inhomogeneity in our wave equation breaks the translational symmetry and the criteria derived for homogeneous equations do not apply anymore .",
    "however , our stability criterion is still related to a vanishing derivative , namely @xmath69 . looking at figure  [ clength ] , one could expect that @xmath171 might be a necessary condition for the stability of the stationary waves .",
    "however , if one considers the examples in  @xcite , there is one example for which the stable fluxons have @xmath172 ( corollary  6 and figure  9 ) and one example for which there is a curve of stable fluxons and the curve folds twice . on this curve",
    ", we have both @xmath172 and @xmath171 ( theorem  8 and figure  17 ) .",
    "so on first view , there does nt seem to be a relation between the slope of the @xmath44-@xmath22 curve and stability .",
