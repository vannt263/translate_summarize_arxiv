    "three - level systems arise in many physical contexts .",
    "a spin-1 particle in an external magnetic field , three states of atoms or molecules coupled by lasers or other interactions , and oscillations among the three neutrino flavors are just a few varied examples that lead to a schrdinger equation for the wave function or , equivalently , for the evolution operator @xmath0 ,    @xmath1    here , and throughout , we set @xmath2 . in a matrix representation , @xmath3 is a @xmath4 matrix . as examples , population trapping and dispersion",
    "was considered through @xcite    @xmath5    where the coefficients @xmath6 represent couplings between level one and two and between two and three while the diagonal elements give the energy levels and detunings .",
    "multiphoton coupling in molecular systems has used @xcite    @xmath7    while recent treatments of quantum control in the rotating - wave approximation considered @xcite    @xmath8    with constant coefficients for the diagonal entries , the two hamiltonians in eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) are essentially equivalent upon shifting the zero of the energy scale and suitable identification of the constants .",
    "some of these studies introduced decay phenomenologically by considering complex values for the diagonal entries . a fuller treatment of dissipation and decoherence proceeds , however , by replacing the unitary evolution equation in eq .  ( [ eqn1 ] ) by master equations for the density matrix @xmath9 .",
    "a widely used class of such equations is the liouville - von neumann - lindblad equation @xcite ,    @xmath10 + \\frac{1}{2}i\\!\\sum_{k}\\left ( [ l_k\\rho , l_k^{\\dagger } ] + [ l_k,\\rho l_k^{\\dagger } ] \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & [ h,\\rho ] -\\frac{1}{2}i\\!\\sum_{k}\\left ( l_k^{\\dagger } l_k\\rho + \\rho l_k^{\\dagger } l_k-2l_k\\rho l_k^{\\dagger } \\right)\\ ! , \\label{eqn5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where an over - dot denotes differentiation with respect to time , and the @xmath11 are operators in the system through which dissipation and decoherence are introduced .",
    "even though this can result in non - unitary evolution , the form of the equation preserves tr(@xmath12 ) and positivity of probabilities . a more mathematical discussion of such  super - operators \" and  dynamical semigroups \" is given in @xcite .",
    "note that preservation of the trace so that there is no overall dissipation hinges on the coefficient 2 in the last term above , any other value leading to a change in the value of the trace with time .    in recent papers @xcite ,",
    "we have developed a technique for solving eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) .",
    "this method , which seems to have been independently rediscovered several times over the decades , with the earliest reference going at least back to wei and norman @xcite , separates the operator aspect from the time dependence by writing    @xmath13 ,   \\label{eqn6}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath14 are operators chosen to be time independent while the @xmath15 are classical functions that carry all the time dependence .",
    "our constructive procedure consists of inserting eq .",
    "( [ eqn6 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) whereupon the derivative on the left - hand side can be rearranged to have the same structure as the right - hand side through repeated application of the baker - campbell - hausdorff ( bch ) identity @xcite and choosing the @xmath15 suitably .",
    "these functions are seen to satisfy a set of well - defined first - order differential equations .",
    "all the operator aspects are handled analytically in the bch manipulations while the time dependence aspect is isolated into the equations for the @xmath16 .",
    "these may require numerical solution but that is readily carried out through a simple mathematica program @xcite .",
    "the same procedure also applies to the lindblad structure of eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) after first recasting it into the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) , namely ,    @xmath17    where @xmath18 are suitable linear combinations , @xmath19 in number , of the density matrix elements themselves .",
    "such a translation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eqn7 ] ) passes , of course , from the @xmath20 matrix structure of @xmath21 and @xmath11 into @xmath22 matrices for the operators in @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the lindblad equation for a two - level system is also of the @xmath4 form of eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqn7 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the above construction requires that all the operators that arise as a result of the bch application be included in the set of operators @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn6 ] ) .",
    "clearly , for the most general three - level problem , this requires eight linearly independent matrices which , along with the unit matrix , provide a complete description .",
    "the eight traceless matrices used in a standard description of su(3 ) @xcite are a convenient choice . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we restricted our attention to forms of @xmath21 and @xmath11 for which a smaller subset , namely three , sufficed :    @xmath24    this set of three , displaying also their @xmath25 notation in the su(3 ) literature @xcite , coincide with the so(3 ) angular momentum operators of three - dimensional rotations and close under mutual commutation between them .",
    "thus , only three such terms and the unit operator are necessary in eq .",
    "( [ eqn6 ] ) , affording a considerable simplification .",
    "( it helps to replace @xmath26 and @xmath27 by their linear combinations @xmath28 . ) in particular , the resulting set of equations for the three @xmath29 are readily amenable to solution @xcite , consisting of a riccati equation ( first - order and quadratically nonlinear ) for one of them whose solution then leads to simple quadrature solutions for the other two .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath11 considered in @xcite permitted such a use of the so(3 ) sub - group of su(3 ) to simplify the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) and ( [ eqn5 ] ) .",
    "however , hamiltonians such as those in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn2])-([eqn4 ] ) can not be expressed in terms of just the three operators in eq .",
    "( [ eqn8 ] ) .",
    "similarly , a two - level lindblad equation @xcite with @xmath30 , gives an eq .",
    "( [ eqn7 ] ) of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath31    with @xmath32 .",
    "again , the @xmath23 operator requires use of the full set of eight operators of the su(3 ) algebra .",
    "such a set of eight includes , besides the three in eq .",
    "( [ eqn8 ] ) , three other off - diagonal matrices @xcite ,    @xmath33    and two diagonal ones ,    @xmath34    all eight operators and the unit operator are needed in eq .",
    "( [ eqn6 ] ) for the general solution .",
    "once again , the linear combinations that simplify the commutators and , therefore , the final set of equations for @xmath29 are @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "table 1 shows the commutators between this set of eight operators .",
    "the three sets of triplets \\{a , b , c } coincide to within factors of @xmath37 with the sets \\{v , t , u } used in the su(3 ) literature @xcite .    [",

    "( [ eqn6 ] ) is a feature of our technique .",
    "inspection of table 1 permits optimal ordering such that each application of the bch identity generates at most two terms .",
    "we choose , thereby , the order    @xmath38    evaluating @xmath39 , re - arranging through use of the bch identity into the form of an operator sum acting from the left on @xmath0 , the coefficients of @xmath40 in the operator sum are , respectively ,    @xmath41    along with @xmath42 multiplying @xmath43 .",
    "we have defined for convenience ,    @xmath44    the above set of expressions can be matched to any @xmath21 in eq .",

    "( [ eqn7 ] ) with nine arbitrary time - dependent entries to provide defining equations for the @xmath29 and @xmath45 in eq .",

    "the above eight equations fall into two groups , the first four involving only @xmath50 .",
    "they may be solved first and then serve as inputs for solving the remaining four equations .",
    "this structure was anticipated in our previous work @xcite , because the @xmath51 matrices in eq .",
    "( [ eqn7 ] ) that follow from the operators ( @xmath46 ) are in @xmath52 block - diagonal form .",
    "the above set of equations are , of course , more complicated than in @xcite , being more nonlinear but note again the characteristic structure of no higher power than quadratic of any @xmath29 .",
    "after completion of our work , we became aware of closely related papers that use the wei - norman @xcite procedure for three - level problems @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite uses a product of nine exponentials involving the operators \\{t , u , v } of su(3 ) with an arrangement slightly different in order from ours in eq .",
    "( [ eqn12 ] ) .",
    "our choice seems to yield a less complicated set of equations in eq .",

    "the most general two - level problem with an arbitrary time - dependent hamiltonian and any choice for the @xmath11 in the master equation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) leads to a @xmath4 equation for the density matrix elements such as eq .",

    "1 provides an illustration for particular choices of the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eqn9 ] ) .",
    "the left - hand side of the panels show perfect agreement with the solutions obtained by a different numerical procedure in @xcite .",
    "the right - hand side shows for comparison our earlier results @xcite where the decoherence part involving @xmath53 was simplified so as to reduce the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) to a unit - diagonal contribution on the right - hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ eqn7 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqn9 ] ) . as expected , the difference between the two lies mainly in the off - diagonal density matrix element and the rate of damping .",
    "the entropy , while still rising monotonically to @xmath54 as the system evolves from a pure state to a mixed one , also differs in these two models of the decoherence .",
    "the comparison suggests that the simplified model for decoherence introduced in @xcite works reasonably well .",
    "since it is much easier to implement , especially for higher @xmath55 , requiring only @xmath55-dimensional matrices rather than @xmath56 , we will so use it below for three - level systems .",
