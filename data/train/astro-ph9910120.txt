    "x - ray spectra and rapid variability provide discriminating signatures for the properties of accreting compact objects .",
    "correlating these characteristics in the case of weakly - magnetic neutron stars has provided strong constraints on physical models for their accretion flows ( see van der klis 1998 for a review ) .",

    "accreting black holes show a variety of x - ray spectral states ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ) .",
    "the majority of sources are usually observed in the so - called hard / low and soft / high states named after the relative hardness of the x - ray spectra and the luminosity in the soft ( @xmath1  kev ) x - ray band . in the standard paradigm , the soft and hard x - ray spectral components are attributed , respectively , to a geometrically thin accretion disk and a hot comptonizing medium , with their relative contribution determining the source state ( as is the case for coronal models [ see , e.g. , haardt & maraschi 1993 ; zdziarski et al . 1998 ; poutanen & coppi 1998 ; dove et al .",
    "1997 for recent studies ] , advection - dominated accretion flows [ e.g. , esin et al . 1997 ] , etc . ) . in most cases , the x - ray spectra of the hard / low state show no evidence for soft blackbody emission ( e.g. , esin et al .",
    "1997 ) or strong reflection features ( i.e. , the backscattered emission from the putative accretion disk ; see , e.g. , gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ) . based on this",
    ", it has been argued that , in the hard state , the geometrically thin disks do not extend down to the innermost stable orbit but are truncated at tens or hundreds of schwarzchild radii .",
    "the rapid variability properties of black holes can be used in assessing the accretion - flow geometries inferred from spectral models .",
    "various types of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) and peaked noise features have been observed from many persistent and transient black - hole sources ( e.g. , van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "the frequencies of these variability components follow correlations that are consistent with the ones observed in neutron - star systems ( wijnands & van der klis 1999 ; psaltis , belloni , & van der klis 1999a ) .",
    "they are , therefore , likely to be produced by similar physical mechanisms .",
    "in particular , the qpo properties in both black - hole and neutron - star systems vary systematically and reproducibly with spectral state and can have fractional widths down to @xmath2 ( see van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "for this reason , although they are related to the hard ( @xmath3  kev ) component of the x - ray spectrum , their frequencies are believed to be determined by modulations in the geometrically thin component of the accretion flow .    in this _ letter _ , we use the empirical correlations between qpo frequencies in neutron - star and black - hole systems to infer the fastest variability timescales for specific black - hole spectral states .",
    "this information allows us to place upper bounds on the inner radii of the geometrically thin components of the accretion flows and compare them to those inferred by the spectral models of galactic black holes .",
    "even though we use the empirically determined correlations , our results are supported by the recent identification of the various observed qpo frequencies with fundamental general - relativistic frequencies around compact objects ( stella & vietri 1999 ; stella , vietri , & morsink 1999 ; psaltis & norman 1999 ) .",
    "we use previously published data for a sample of four persistent and six transient galactic black - hole systems .",

    "the observed qpos in accreting compact objects are typically narrow ( @xmath19 ) with properties that vary systematically and reproducibly with spectral state .",
    "although qpos are associated with the hard x - ray spectral components ( see , e.g. , berger et al.1996 ) , the above characteristics can be accounted for in a physical model only if the timing properties of the qpos are associated with the geometrically thin component of the accretion flow . indeed , for all frequencies in the flow , @xmath20 , and hence @xmath21 .",
    "this argument is model - independent and has been the basis of most theoretical models for neutron - star and black - hole qpos ( see psaltis et al .",
    "1999b for a recent review of qpo models ) .",
    "in such models , comptonization in a hot medium that surrounds the accretion disk typically amplifies the oscillations ( lee & miller 1998 ; see also miller et al .",
    "1998 ) , possibly accounting for the fact that strong qpos are observed only when the hot component of the accretion flow is present .",
    "the centroid frequency @xmath22 of the qpo provides an upper bound on the inner radius @xmath23 of the geometrically thin component of the accretion flow .",
    "since the fastest variability timescale at any radius around a compact object is the keplerian orbital frequency , then @xmath24 and hence @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the mass of the compact object . in this section",
    "we deduce the fastest variability timescales during different black - hole spectral states and use relation  ( [ nu_k ] ) to place upper bounds on the inner radii of the accretion disks .",
    "the power - density spectra of accreting black holes typically show a broad noise component that is flat - topped up to a break frequency @xmath28 and decreases as a power law above it .",
    "often , a narrow qpo at a frequency @xmath29 and a broader peaked noise component at a frequency @xmath30 are also detected ( typically @xmath31 ; see , van der klis 1995 ; psaltis et al .",
    "when present , the qpo at @xmath29 is typically narrow ( @xmath32 ) and unambiguously detected ; this is the qpo we discuss in  2 for the sources in our sample .    in accreting , weakly - magnetic neutron stars , the same variability components are observed in the power spectra , together with a third qpo peak at a frequency @xmath33 ( van der klis 1998 ; psaltis et al .",
    "in such systems , the qpos with frequencies @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath34 are often called the hbo , lower khz qpo , and upper khz qpo , respectively ( see van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "the frequencies of all these power - spectral components vary over wide ranges , often by a factor of @xmath35 in a given source , and yet @xmath29 follows simple power - law relations ( @xmath36/d.o.f.@xmath37 ; see psaltis et al.1998 , 1999a for a thorough statistical analysis ) with @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath34 ( wijnands & van der klis 1999 ; psaltis et al.1999a ) .",
    "these correlations depend only weakly ( if at all ) on the other properties of the sources thus demonstrating that they are produced in the accretion flows and not by the compact objects .    in neutron - star systems ,",
    "the fastest observed timescale is given by the qpo at frequency @xmath34 , which follows in all sources the empirical correlation @xmath38  khz@xmath39  hz ( psaltis et al .",
    "1999a , 1999b ) .",
    "this correlation together with relation  ( [ nu_k ] ) gives an upper bound on the inner radius of the accretion disk , i.e. , @xmath40 observation of a narrow @xmath41  hz qpo in a neutron - star system , for example , constrains the inner radius of the geometrically thin accretion flow to be comparable to the radius of the innermost stable orbit .    in black - hole systems ,",
    "the frequencies @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 also vary widely , but follow the same correlations ( with systematic differences in the normalization of less than a factor of two ) as those exhibited by neutron - star sources ( psaltis et al.1999a ) .",
    "this implies that the three variability components with frequencies @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are each produced by similar physical mechanisms in both types of compact objects . as a result ,",
    "neither @xmath29 nor @xmath30 are likely to be associated with the highest keplerian frequencies in the accretion disks and hence can not be used in constraining the inner extent of the accretion disks .",
    "moreover , qpos at @xmath34 , which could provide this constraint directly , have not been detected from any black - hole system52 ; mndez et al .",
    "1998b ) in which the qpo at @xmath30 is strong and can be directly detected , but the qpo at @xmath34 is revealed only after the data are analyzed using the so - called shift - and - add technique . ] .",
    "we conjecture that the same physical mechanism in both neutron stars and black holes produces qpos at @xmath29 and , therefore , even in black holes , @xmath29 is related to the inner radius of the accretion disk as in equation  ( [ rin ] ) .",
    "physical motivation for this hypothesis is provided by recent modeling of the correlations between the qpo frequencies in neutron - star and black - hole systems ( stella & vietri 1999 ; stella et al .",
    "1999 ; see also psaltis & norman 1999 ) . in these models , @xmath34 , @xmath30 , and @xmath29",
    "are identified , respectively , with the orbital , periastron precession , and twice the nodal precession general - relativistic frequencies of a perturbed orbit around the compact object .",
    "given an observation of a nodal precession frequency in a source , the radius of the orbit , and hence an upper bound on the inner radius of the accretion disk , is ( see stella et al .",
    "1999 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the specific angular momentum of the compact object and we have set @xmath44 .",
    "the scaling in equation  ( [ gr ] ) is similar to the empirically inferred one , giving physical motivation to relation  ( [ rin ] ) .",
    "relation  ( [ rin ] ) provides a bound on the inner radius of the geometrically thin accretion disk for each source in our sample .",
    "the inferred bounds are shown in figure  1 , for two different values of the black - hole mass . in all spectral states",
    "in which narrow qpos have been detected , the accretion disks appear to extend down to @xmath45 .",
    "note here , that the inferred bounds are consistent with the inner radii of accretion disks in neutron - star sources , as determined by the frequencies of the khz qpos ( see , e.g. , miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ) .",
    "the upper bounds on the inner accretion disk radii derived in  3 imply that , in general , the geometrically thin disk component extends close to the innermost stable orbit , independently of the specific spectral state which the accreting black hole displays",
    ". our findings are complementary to the constraints on the geometry of the accretion flows around galactic black holes derived on the basis of radiation physics and spectral analysis of the different spectral states ( poutanen , krolik & ryde 1997 ; gierlisky et al.1997 ; poutanen & coppi 1998 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "1998 ; done & ycki 1998 ; esin et al .  1997 ; wilms et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , in such models it is argued that , because the reflection features in the hard state of black - hole systems are much less prominent ( e.g. , the amplitude of compton reflection @xmath46 is @xmath47 and its associated fe k@xmath43 lines are weak ) than in seyfert galaxies , the inner radius of the disk can not be very close to the black hole , in order to subtend a smaller solid angle to the x - ray emitting region ( e.g. , gierliski et al.1997 ) .    in these spectral models",
    ", it is often postulated that , inside the truncated disk , a hot central medium / corona  like structure produces the observed hard component of the spectrum .",
    "the transition to soft state is then assumed to occur as the geometrically thin disk moves inwards and the dissipated energy emerges in the form of a blackbody - like spectrum ( see , however , di matteo , celotti , & fabian 1999 ) . an alternative possibility , which includes a dynamical description of the comptonizing medium , has been discussed within the context of advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ; esin , mcclintock , & narayan 1997 ) ; in these models , the inner compton medium in the hard state is identified with an advection dominated region , outside of which the thin disk exists .",
    "figure  1 shows that the qpo frequencies observed in the hard and very - high states of all sources in our sample lie in a rather restricted range .",
    "even though the presence of a transition in the accretion disk properties can not be excluded , figure  1 implies that the inner radii of the accretion disks can not show large excursions between the different spectral states .",
    "therefore , the concept of a geometrically thin disk retreating significantly during the soft - to - hard state transition is not supported by our results .",
    "( note though that for some sources there seems to be weak evidence for a systematic change in the qpo frequency with spectral state . ) in agreement with the presence of a soft x - ray excess in the observed spectra of black - hole systems in the very - high state , we find that the inferred inner accretion disk radii are comparable to the radius of the innermost stable orbit . on the other hand , for all sources in our sample , the inner accretion disk radii in the hard state are inferred to be _ only _ @xmath48 ( see fig .  1 ) .    to illustrate this point",
    "explicitly , we discuss specific sources for which detailed spectral modeling has been performed and compare the inferred inner disk radii to the bounds deduced here based on their rapid variability . for the hard state of cyg  x-1 , the truncation radius of the accretion disk is inferred to be @xmath49 in coronal models ( poutanen et al .  1997 ;",
    "poutanen & coppi 1998 ; done & ycki 1999 ) and @xmath50 ( or strictly @xmath51 ) in adaf models ( esin et al .",
    "1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the detection of a @xmath18  hz qpo in the same state implies @xmath52 , depending on the mass of the black hole .",
    "for the hard state of gx  339@xmath54 , @xmath53 for both coronal and adaf models ( zdziarski et al .",

    "j0422@xmath432 , adaf models require @xmath55 ( esin et al .",
    "1997 ) , while the presence of a @xmath56  hz qpo constraints the inner disk radius to be @xmath57 .    in all the above sources",
    ", the discrepancy between the inner disk radii inferred from the rapid variability and those reported from spectral studies can be as large as a few orders of magnitude .",
    "however , in many spectral models , @xmath23 was not necessarily chosen to be the smallest value consistent with the observed x - ray spectra .",
    "here we showed that rapid variability properties impose upper bounds on the inner extent of the geometrically thin accretion disks in galactic black - hole systems .",
    "we , therefore , argue that combining both the variability and spectral properties of accreting black holes provides complementary constraints on models of their inner accretion flows .",
    "our constraints on the inner radii will become unambiguous with the detection of quasi - periodic variability in the hard state of black hole systems with frequencies @xmath58  hz .",
    "such a detection would also impose a strict upper bound on the mass of the compact object and possibly reveal the presence of a spinning black hole .",
