    "polarization experiments have been proven to be a powerful tool to study the properties of strong interaction in general and to test the validity of popular models in particular .",
    "great achievements have been made in the last years by studying the spin - dependent structure functions , the single - spin left - right asymmetries , hyperon polarizations etc , both experimentally and theoretically . in this talk ,",
    "i would like to bring your attention to another series of polarization experiments which may also provide useful information on strong interaction .",
    "the experiments which i mention are the measurements of vector meson polarization in high energy reaction .",
    "i emphasize here in particular the following : ( 1 ) vector meson polarization can be studied experimentally by measuring the angular distribution of the decay products .",
    "( 2 ) compared with other spin non - zero hadrons such as the hyperons , the production rate of a vector meson is usually higher and the origin is simpler due to the much smaller contribution from the decay of heavier hadrons .",
    "this implies less theoretical uncertainties in calculations and better statistics in experiments .",
    "therefore , the study of polarization of the vector mesons may provide us important information to understand the role of spin in hadronic reactions .",
    "the polarization of a vector meson is described by the spin density matrix @xmath1 or its element @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 label the spin component along the quantization axis , usually the @xmath5-axis of the frame . the diagonal elements",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the unit - trace matrix are the relative intensities of meson spin component @xmath3 to take the values @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 respectively . in experiment ,",
    "@xmath7 can be measured from the angular distribution of its decay products and a deviation of @xmath7 from @xmath12 indicates spin alignment . in the helicity basis ,",
    "i.e. , in the case that the @xmath5-axis is chosen as the moving direction of the vector meson , the matrix is usually called helicity density matrix and @xmath7 represents the probability of the vector meson to be in the helicity zero state .",
    "measurements have been carried out in different reactions@xcite .",
    "we see in particular that data with high accuracy have been obtained in @xmath0 annihilation at lep recently @xcite .",
    "the data@xcite show that @xmath7 is significantly larger than @xmath12 in particular in the large @xmath5 ( here @xmath5 is the fractional momentum carried by the vector meson of the whole system ) region .    being not aware of what we can learn from these data , we made an analysis by taking the spins of the vector mesons as the sum of the spin of the fragmenting quark and that of the anti - quark which is created in the hadronization and combine with the fragmenting quark to form the vector meson .",
    "we found out that the data imply a significant polarization of the anti - quark in the opposite direction of the fragmenting quark .",
    "we extended the calculations to other reactions to make predictions for future experiments .",
    "we also studied the situation in unpolarized hadron - hadron collisions and showed that the spin alignment of vector meson in such reactions should be closely related to the single - spin left - right asymmetries .",
    "i will summarize these results in the following . the material of this talk is taken from the recent publications@xcite carried out in collaboration with dr .",
    "xu qing - hua and dr .",
    "liu chun - xiu in shandong university .",
    "we calculate the spin alignment of vector mesons in @xmath14 by dividing them into the following two groups and considering them separately : ( a ) those which contain the fragmenting quark @xmath15 ; ( b ) those which do nt contain the fragmenting quark .",
    "the spin density matrix @xmath16 for the vector meson @xmath17 is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively the average number and the spin density matrix of the vector mesons from group ( a ) ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 are those from ( b ) ; @xmath23 , and @xmath5 is the momentum fraction of @xmath24 carried off by the vector meson @xmath17 . since @xmath19 and @xmath21 are independent of the spin properties they are calculated using an event generator based on a fragmentation model which gives a good description of the unpolarized data .",
    "we used generator @xmath25 in our calculations .",
    "there are many different possibilities to produce the vector mesons in group ( b ) , we take them as unpolarized , i.e. , @xmath22=1/3 . for those vector mesons from group ( a ) ,",
    "i.e. , those which contain @xmath15 and an anti - quark @xmath26 created in the fragmentation , the spin is taken as the sum of the spins of @xmath24 and @xmath26 , thus the spin density matrix @xmath20 can be calculated from the direct product of the spin density matrix @xmath27 for @xmath15 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 . transforming the direct product , @xmath30=@xmath27@xmath31@xmath32 , to the coupled basis @xmath33 ( where @xmath34=@xmath35+@xmath36 )",
    ", we can obtain @xmath20 . in the helicity frame of @xmath24 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath5-axis is taken as the moving direction of @xmath24 , @xmath20 is given by , @xmath37    r8 cm -0.5 cm spin alignment of @xmath38 in @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath39 pole .",
    "the figure is taken from [ 7 ] .    where @xmath40 is the longitudinal polarizations of @xmath15 and @xmath41 is the polarization vector of the anti - quark @xmath26 .",
    "hence , the 00-component of the density matrix takes the following simple form , @xmath42 where there is only one unknown variable @xmath43 , the polarization of @xmath26 along the moving or polarization direction of @xmath24 .    using eqs.([eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] )",
    ", we can determine @xmath43 in different cases by fitting the data@xcite in the @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath44 pole for the production of different vector mesons .",
    "we found that@xcite , the data for different vector mesons can reasonably be fitted if we take , @xmath45 where @xmath46 . as an example , we show @xmath47 as a function of @xmath5 in fig.1 .",
    "we emphasize that the relation between @xmath43 and @xmath40 given in eq.(4 ) is a consequence of @xmath0 data at lep .",
    "it is unknown whether it is universal in the sense that it is also applicable to other energies and/or other reactions . if yes , it should contain useful information on the hadronization mechanism .",
    "we therefore extended the calculations to other reactions such as @xmath50 or @xmath49 with polarized beams in [ 8 ] .",
    "the results obtained show that the spin alignments of vector mesons in these reactions are all quite significant and should be able to tested by future experiments such as those at rhic and/or by compass .",
    "i show , as examples , the results for @xmath50 and @xmath51 in fig.2 and fig.3 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "another interesting phenomenon in this connection is the spin alignment of vector meson in unpolarized hadron - hadron collision .",
    "the situation here is quite similar to transverse hyperon polarization in unpolarized hadron - hadron collision .",
    "the quantization axis is chosen as the normal of the production plane and the data show that there is a significant spin alignment of vector meson at large @xmath52 and moderate @xmath53 .",
    "we argued that the existence of the three classes of phenomena , i.e. the large left - right asymmetries @xmath57 in hadron - hadron collisions with transversely polarized beams@xcite , the large transverse polarization of hyperon @xmath58 in unpolarized @xmath59 or @xmath60 collisions@xcite , and significant spin alignment of vector mesons @xmath61 in unpolarized @xmath59 collisions , are different manifestations of the same spin correlations of the type @xmath62 in the reaction .",
    "[ here , @xmath63 is the spin of the fragmenting quark ; @xmath64 is the unit vector in the normal direction of the production plane , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are respectively the momentum of the incident hadron and that of the produced hadron . ]",
    "we demonstrated the close relation between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and that between @xmath57 and @xmath61 in unpolarized hadron - hadron collisions in the following way : we note that the three effects exist mainly in the fragmentation regions and hadrons produced in these regions are mainly products of the valence quarks combined with suitable anti - sea - quark or sea - diquarks .",
    "the existence of spin correlation @xmath62 implies that the valence quark which combines with suitable anti - sea - quark ( or quarks ) to form the produced hadron was transversely polarized to the production plan .",
    "we use the results derived from the @xmath57 data@xcite for the strength of the above - mentioned @xmath67 type of spin - correlation as input to calculate the polarization of the valence - quark before the hadronization . using the result",
    "obtained as input , we calculated the hyperon polarization in @xcite and spin alignment of the vector mesons in @xcite .",
    "the obtained results are consistent with the available data and predictions for future experiments are made .    for vector meson spin alignment in unpolarized @xmath59 collisions ,",
    "the results obtained are quite different for the vector mesons of the following two groups according to their flavor compositions : ( 1 ) those which have a valence quark of the same flavor as one of the valence quarks of the incident hadron ; ( 2 ) those which have no valence quark in common with the incident hadron .",
    "the behavior of @xmath68 as a function of @xmath52 for each group is similar but is quite different from each other . for those from group ( 1 ) , @xmath68 increases with increasing @xmath52 .",
    "it starts from @xmath12 at @xmath69 , increases monotonically with increasing @xmath52 , and reach about @xmath70 as @xmath71 .",
    "a rough estimation of the shape of the @xmath52-dependence of @xmath68 is made and the results are given in fig.4 .",
    "for those from group ( 2 ) , we expect no significant spin alignment , i.e. @xmath72 for all @xmath52 .",
    "all these can be checked by future experiments .",
