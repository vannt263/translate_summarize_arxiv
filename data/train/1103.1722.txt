    "the rabi frequency is obtained by fitting the first @xmath220s of the oscillation where the expansion has little effect .",

    "the intermediate @xmath176 pulse maps the interferometric phase on the measured observable @xmath238 , which is the projection of the atomic spin vector on the z - axis in the bloch representation of figure [ fig : coherence](c ) . to modify the interferometric phase , the frequency of the microwave driving field is scanned with respect to the ground state hyperfine transition .",
    "figure [ fig : coherence](a ) shows the traces of the atomic state interferometer acquired in real time for different microwave detunings .",

    "the characterization shows that the superposition state of an interferometer can be measured without necessarily blurring the fringes .",
    "this indicates that the measurement was realized in the weak measurement regime , where the atomic state is not strongly projected .",

    "this results in a snr enhancement proportional to @xmath245 @xcite for a given spontaneous emission rate ( @xmath246 ) .    to prevent for the light - shift effect of the carrier ,",
    "the measurement can be realized in reflection @xcite . in the scheme presented in figure [ fig : cavity_lines ] , to measure the population difference , the detection realized with the two sidebands is shot noise limited because of the strong local oscillator .",
    "in addition , the effective interaction between atoms and photons can take advantage of the trapping and probing that exploits the same cavity mode .",
    "we have presented an apparatus designed for the production of spin - squeezed cold atomic samples in a dual - frequency high - finesse cavity .",
    "we have shown that , thanks to the intra - cavity power enhancement , the chosen configuration is suitable for all - optical trapping of atoms using standard optical telecommunication technologies .",
    "we described a new non - demolition heterodyne detection scheme .",
    "this scheme is limited by the optical shot noise of the probe and presents a high rejection of optical path length fluctuations .",
    "we demonstrated the method by performing nondestructive measurements of the coherent evolution of internal atomic states . from the nondestructive measurement of rabi oscillations , we have shown that the decoherence induced by the probe can be limited by the inhomogeneous light shift from the carrier and not by the spontaneous emission induced by the sideband .",
    "we also presented a real - time measurement of the atomic state evolution in a ramsey interferometer with low decoherence .",
    "our experiment is particularly suited for metrology with a high squeezing level of large particles numbers .",
    "because of the power build - up at 1560 nm , we will achieve large degenerate samples with low intensity and heterodyne detection can be enhanced by using the cavity at 780 nm .",
    "moreover , using the cavity enhanced atom - light coupling combined with the intrinsic atomic and optical mode overlap should allow us to reach the ultimate sensitivity of the heterodyne measurement device while avoiding inhomogeneous light - shift from the carrier .",
