    "the interaction - induced mott transition between a metal and a paramagnetic insulator is central to the field of strongly correlated electron systems.@xcite much insight into this phenomenon has been gained in numerical studies of the single - band hubbard model within dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft).@xcite in particular , the phase diagram and the behavior of characteristic observables ( such as the effective mass ) have been established with high precision@xcite - despite the lack of analytic solutions .",
    "while the single - band assumption is rather crude in correlated solids ( see below ) , it can be quite accurate for two - flavor mixtures of ultracold fermions on optical lattices . since , in addition , the effective interaction between neutral ultracold alkali atoms ( in their electronic ground state ) is very short - ranged , such systems appear as nearly perfect finite - size realizations of the single - band hubbard model , with the prospect of addressing some of the open questions ( e.g. regarding high-@xmath2 superconductivity ) via the tunable _ quantum simulation _ of the underlying hamiltonian .",
    "an important step in this direction was the recent experimental verification of the mott transition in cold - atom systems,@xcite for which accurate quantitative predictions based on dmft were essential .",
    "the low - energy electronic properties of correlated solids are usually determined by @xmath3 orbitals , which are five - fold degenerate ( per spin ) in the atomic limit .",
    "this degeneracy is partially lifted by the crystal field , resulting , e.g. , in a three - fold degenerate @xmath4 band and a two - fold degenerate @xmath5 band for cubic symmetry .",
    "each of these bands is characterized by a local potential plus various hund rule couplings ( which can also couple inequivalent bands ) .",
    "thus , the multi - orbital case is not only richer physically@xcite ( including the possibility of orbital - selective mott transitions@xcite ) , but is complex already by the number of parameters .",
    "in addition , obtaining accurate numerical results rapidly becomes costly and challenging with increasing number @xmath6 of orbitals .",
    "in fact , some methods such as the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) become impractical beyond @xmath7 orbitals . as a consequence ,",
    "few properties of the multi - orbital hubbard model can be considered well - established with high precision , even at the dmft level .",
    "however , there is a unique generalization of the single - band hubbard model to arbitrary degeneracy which avoids the introduction of additional parameters : in the su(@xmath0 ) symmetric hubbard model , all spins and orbitals are equivalent , i.e. , share the same local potential , the same hopping matrix elements , and they are coupled by the same local interaction . in other words ,",
    "the phase space of this particular multi - orbital model is identical to the single - band case .",
    "moreover , interesting analytic insights have been obtained in the limit of large band multiplicity @xmath8 , including an exact expression for the critical interaction of the ground - state metal - insulator transition ( at half band filling ) as well as scaling arguments for the finite - temperature critical end point.@xcite thus , the sequence of models obtained by varying @xmath6 connects two well - established  and somewhat special  limits ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , while the intermediate regime @xmath11 shares many characteristics with generic multi - orbital models , including numerical difficulties .",
    "indeed , the su(@xmath0 ) hubbard model has , so far , been explored in this regime only using approximate methods , namely the dynamical slave - rotor approximation ( dsr),@xcite the projective self - consistent method ( pscm),@xcite and the self - energy functional approximation ( sfa ) with one bath site per orbital.@xcite a fully controlled treatment is clearly desirable on fundamental grounds and as a solid starting point for generic multi - orbital physics .",
    "quite recently , the su(@xmath12 ) hubbard model ( with total degeneracy @xmath13 ) has also become of direct physical relevance , namely in the ultracold atom context : in rare - earth atoms , a large number of internal states can be addressed , which are essentially decoupled from the valence electrons .",
    "consequently , all atoms in the electronic ground state experience the same optical potential and have the same pairwise interactions;@xcite a mixture with n internal states on an optical lattice can , therefore , realize the su(@xmath12 ) symmetric hubbard model . a mott insulating state has already been observed in a su(6 ) symmetric system of fermionic ytterbium atoms ( @xmath14yb ) on a cubic optical lattice,@xcite opening the door to detailed experimental investigations of mott metal - insulator transitions in su(@xmath12 ) symmetric hubbard models ( with @xmath13 ) .",
    "this breakthrough has sparked theoretical interest in both su(@xmath12 ) hubbard@xcite and heisenberg@xcite systems , with initial studies being limited to one spatial dimension@xcite and to a slave - particle method,@xcite respectively .    in this work ,",
    "we construct the phase boundaries of the mott transition at half filling and for up to @xmath15 bands , based on numerically exact multigrid hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo@xcite estimates of characteristic observables .",
    "we also derive scaling laws which predict the phase boundaries for arbitrary orbital degeneracy @xmath16 with high accuracy .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] , we establish our notation and relate the su(@xmath12 ) symmetric hubbard model to generic multi - band models .",

    "the coupling between these orbitals is provided , in general , by the interorbital density - density interaction @xmath29 and the hund s rule coupling @xmath22 ; the latter contains both an ising - type contribution , coupling to the spin densities @xmath30 ( second line ) , as well as spin - flip and pair - hopping terms ( third line ) . in the limit @xmath31",

    "thus , at @xmath34 , spin and orbitals are fully equivalent and one arrives at the su(@xmath12 ) symmetric hubbard model with @xmath35 even : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a combined spin - orbital index .",
    "this is precisely the situation which has been realized , within the single - band approximation and up to the confining potential , using rare - earth ( earth alkali - like ) ytterbium atoms ( @xmath14yb ) on a simple cubic optical lattice.@xcite note that exchange terms as appearing in ( [ eq : j ] ) at @xmath38 require a unique classification of the internal degree of freedom @xmath39 in terms of the `` spin '' variable @xmath28 and can not arise in the su(n ) symmetric case , where all values of @xmath37 are fully equivalent .",

    "we choose the semi - elliptic form associated with the bethe lattice@xcite and set the energy scale as @xmath49 ( for coordination number @xmath50 ) , which implies unit variance of the density of states : @xmath51 .",
    "our numerical results can be translated , e.g. , to the cubic lattice ( in units of the hopping @xmath21 ) by multiplying interactions , energies , and temperatures by @xmath52.@xcite    as the interaction couples only to spin - orbital densities [ i.e. , spin flip and pair hopping terms , as arising in the general model ( [ eq : j ] ) for @xmath38 , are absent ] , dmft solutions can be obtained using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) impurity solvers without any sign problem for arbitrary density .",

    "we use a multi - grid implementation@xcite and , thereby , demonstrate that its inherent elimination of trotter errors from the green function and from observables works reliably and accurately even for a large number @xmath6 of bands and @xmath58 hubbard - stratonovich fields .",
    "consequently , our results are free of significant systematic bias , i.e. , exact within statistical error bars .",
    "these statistical errors are reduced , compared to a generic @xmath6-band model , by employing the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry , i.e. , by averaging green functions and related observables over all @xmath0 values of the internal degree of freedom @xmath37 and the double ( or pair ) occupancy over all @xmath59 pairs @xmath57 .",

    "remarkably , the critical interaction at finite temperatures scales differently : @xmath83 , as was argued convincingly analytically.@xcite in this case , the analytic considerations do not even yield a prefactor ; thus , quantitative predictions regarding @xmath66 are completely dependent on accurate numerical results for sufficiently large values of @xmath6 .",

    "due to the enhanced critical temperatures , the multi - flavor case might make mott physics more accessible than in the single - band ( i.e. , two - flavor ) case , in which the mott signatures@xcite seen so far correspond to crossovers , not true phase transitions . on the other hand",
    ", the experimental two - flavor studies profited from the fact that the mit extends , as a crossover , far above @xmath65 with relatively little variation in @xmath24 ; thus , it is possible , e.g. , to obtain good estimates of @xmath66 from measurements at @xmath180 .",
    "this is still true in the su(3 ) case.@xcite at large m , however , the relative variation of @xmath24 along the mit line increases significantly , from @xmath181 at @xmath9 to , e.g. , @xmath182 at @xmath1.@xcite one may suspect that the relative variation of @xmath24 in the crossover region is similarly enhanced at large degeneracy , which implies that a closer approach of @xmath65 would be required in order to determine @xmath66 .",
    "such low - temperature experiments might also explore ordering phenomena , which are a fascinating topic of their own and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "more generally , our results provide high - precision numerical benchmarks for evaluating dmft impurity solvers in the challenging regime of moderate to high orbital degeneracy ; they could also be used for assessing the relative importance of nonlocal correlations at higher band degeneracy , e.g. by comparison with high - temperature expansions@xcite or with direct exact calculations once they become available .",
