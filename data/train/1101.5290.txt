    "_ @xcite whether the experimentally observed @xmath3 state indeed has charged excitations with non - abelian braiding statistics is still unknown , altough the discovery of a neutral current in experiment may make us hopeful.@xcite for a review , we refer the reader to nayak _",
    "_ @xcite and to stern.@xcite    in an earlier work @xcite we presented numerical evidence that the fqh ground state ( gs ) at @xmath0 for coulomb interaction , when spin polarized , is in the same universality class as the non - abelian moore - read ( mr ) pfaffian state.@xcite calculating the energy spectrum of the few lowest - energy states by exact diagonalization for electron interactions interpolating between the coulomb interaction @xmath4 and the three - body interaction @xmath5 , for which the mr state is the unique gs , we found for all examined system sizes adiabatic continuity ( ac ) of the gs and no sign of a decrease of the gap between the two limits @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we concluded that ac can be expected even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in addition , we drew a phase diagram in the two - body interaction space ( in the vicinity of the coulomb interaction ) , showing that the fqh gapped phase coincides with the mr phase .",
    "previous theoretical work @xcite gave indications for ac for the spin - polarized @xmath0 gs between the mr and the coulomb limit . in the disk geometry xin wan _",

    ", the question whether the elementary charged excitations preserve their non - abelian properties in going from the mr to the coulomb limit still needs to be examined : this is a very important issue , because braiding of non - abelian quasiparticles has been proposed for topological quantum computation.@xcite at @xmath0 , one expects that qhs can have either charge @xmath1 with the possibility of having non - abelian braiding statistics or @xmath6 with abelian fractional statistics . indeed , the results by tke",

    "@xcite have cast doubt on the existence of localized qhs with charge @xmath1 .",
    "here , we study fully spin - polarized systems with localized qhs in the spherical geometry . this polarization choice is motivated by theoretical investigations concerning this issue : one of us showed that the gs of the disorder - free fqh state at @xmath0 is spin polarized even for vanishing zeeman energy;@xcite recent theoretical work @xcite confirmed this result .",
    "however , from the experimental point of view , the situation is less clear .",
    "transport experiments with variable electron density @xcite or in a tilted magnetic field at high density @xcite have been interpreted in controversial ways : varying the electron density by more than a factor @xmath7,@xcite the excitation gap varies smoothly with no break in slope or discontinuity , indicating that neither gs nor excitations change their character while the zeeman energy varies by an amount that exceeds the measured energy gap by a factor of @xmath8 .",
    "that an unpolarized state would survive under this condition appears unlikely .",
    "also , in high - density samples , the disappearence of the gapped phase in a tilted magnetic field can not be explained by a zeeman energy term with a gaas bulk @xmath9 factor.@xcite nevertheless , arguments have been presented that these experimental results might be consistent with a spin - unpolarized @xmath3 state.@xcite also first results from direct spin polarization measurements , using optical methods,@xcite appear to be consistent with a spin - unpolarized state . as the experimental samples are likely to be inhomogeneous and consist of compressible regions separated by percolating incompressible filaments at @xmath0,@xcite it is not clear that the optical data relate solely to the filaments or to the compressible regions.@xcite the separate determination of the polarization state of the incompressible parts has not yet been possible .",
    "in addition , charged impurities may also induce skyrmions in the incompressible domains,@xcite which will decrease the total spin polarization .",
    "we also note that , once thermally assisted tunneling is taken into account,@xcite the gap obtained from analyzing the dissipative conductance can be as consistent with expectations for a spin - polarized system at @xmath0 ( refs .",
    "17 , 24 and 25 ) as for the hierarchy state at @xmath10 .    in our investigations at first",
    "we show that charge @xmath1 qhs can be localized by a @xmath2-function potential and , varying the form of the localization potential away from the simple @xmath2-function , we also show that there is an optimal localizing potential that minimizes the density oscillations around the qhs .",
    "we also find that in systems with two qhs , in the coulomb case , it is sufficient to have a single @xmath2-function : this localizes a single qh in the gs , while the other is automatically at the antipodal point on the sphere , because of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "we then study how states containing two and four qhs at @xmath3 evolve as the interaction is varied between @xmath5 and @xmath4 , and show that there is ac between the two interaction limits , as in the previous work.@xcite    for two qhs , as the interaction is varied from @xmath5 to @xmath4 , we find that the lowest energy state does not mix with the higher lying ones . for systems containing four qhs , the two lowest - lying states forming a degenerate doublet in the @xmath5 limit @xcite remain the two lowest - energy states even in the limit of pure coulomb interaction @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the majorana fermion associated with the doublet @xcite appears to survive in the coulomb limit .",
    "to better study the mr limit we then repeat the investigations for four qhs using a different pinning potential : also with this approach we obtain ac for the lowest - lying doublet between the two interaction limits , confirming the above results .",
    "finally we present some preliminary results of braiding with qhs , showing that exchanging the position of two qhs , in the presence of two others fixed qhs , the system goes from one of the mr doublet states to the other , showing non - abelian braiding statistics .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the fusion of two qhs , getting an estimate for the mr doublet splitting.@xcite",

    "@xmath23 expresses the full symmetrization over the permutations within the triplet @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the @xmath2-function in the separation of particles @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the constant @xmath28 is chosen as in the earlier work,@xcite such that the gap for @xmath5 is approximately the same as that for @xmath4 ( note that @xmath5 induces an extensive energy for all gs at any @xmath29 ) .    the superscripts @xmath30 and @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) indicate that the coulomb energy @xmath32 is evaluated in the @xmath33 ll , as required for the experimentally realized @xmath0 state , while the three - body interaction @xmath34 is evaluated in the @xmath35 ll , since the mr state is the gs of @xmath5 in the lowest ll .    the pinning term @xmath36 localizes the qhs at fixed positions on the surface of the sphere . in our first calculations ( in sections [ loc ] and [ ac ] ) we consider a parametrization of the pinning potential of the form @xmath37,\\label{vpin1}\\ ] ] where the pinning function @xmath38 is still to be chosen , such that it localizes exactly an @xmath1-charged qh .",
    "this @xmath36 couples to the electron density , interpolating like the electron interaction between ll @xmath33 and @xmath35 with weights @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the overall factor @xmath39 makes the localization term vanish in the mr limit as @xmath41 , just like the coulomb term , both helping to separate the energies of states with charge @xmath1 qhs .",
    "however , in the mr limit ( @xmath42 ) , the @xmath6-charged `` double qh '' has a zero in the electron density and thus zero pinning energy , while the @xmath1-charged qh shows a finite local minimum of the density and thus finite pinning energy .",
    "to separate @xmath1-charged qhs requires either an additional repulsive interaction between qhs or a special pinning potential coupling to the monopole and quadrupole moment of the qhs ( cf .",
    "problems discussed in tke _",
    "@xcite ) . to avoid this difficulty , in this first series of calculations we never reach exactly the mr point , but approach it closely enough to identify the lowest - energy states . in section [ mrlimit ]",
    "we will then use a different localization potential @xcite to circumvent this problem and study the full ac up to the mr point .",
    "all energies are measured in the usual units @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the magnetic length , and taking the energy of the lowest state as reference .",
    "we start by studying the qh localization in the pure coulomb limit , taking for @xmath38 a @xmath2-function pinning potential : choosing a suitable pinning strength we see that it is actually possible to obtain separated @xmath1-charged qhs , in contrast to the results of tke _ _ et al.__@xcite figure 1(a ) shows the polar angle dependence of the density ( upper curves ) and of the integrated missing charge ( lower curves ) for two different pinning strengths , for a system containing two qhs with localizing @xmath2 functions , one at the north and the other at the south pole of the sphere .",
    "we observe that the two qhs are localized at the poles .",
    "however they are large in extent and are accompanied by significant and slowly decaying density oscillations ( cf .",
    "the missing charge @xmath1 is reached ( for the stronger pinning potential ) at @xmath45 and at the equator as required by symmetry .",
    "as the system is compressible at the position of a qh , the shape of the pinning potential will influence its structure .",
    "we therefore study how the pinning potential can be tuned to minimize the size of the qh and to suppress the density oscillations around it . with the choice of shape , depicted in fig .",
    "1(c ) , we obtain an electron density without oscillations , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(b ) : the smooth potential allows to properly separate the two qhs and to reduce their radius to a minimum of @xmath46 .",
    "how is this possible ? figure 1(d ) shows a comparison of the interaction energies , not including the energy due to the pinning forces , for @xmath2-function pinning ( upper line ) and for smooth pinning ( lower line ) .",
    "the circles depict the spectrum of a system with two free qhs , i.e. , without pinning force , as function of the total angular momentum @xmath47 .",
    "we see that the use of a smooth pinning potential allows to obtain a smaller interaction energy , admixing only the lowest - lying @xmath47 eigenstates , while the @xmath2-function potential admixes also higher - lying states , giving rise to the large density oscillations .",
    "we also note that a `` better '' localization , with a pinning potential that further lowers the interaction energy , is unlikely to be possible , because a minimal number of low - energy @xmath47 eigenstates is needed to obtain the desired qh localization .",
    "we note that the energy of two - qhs systems is affected by how well the density oscillations fit with the separation distance of the qhs , such that the energy will show oscillations as function of the qh separation .",
    "the energy oscillations observed in the variational calculation of the majorana fermion energy @xcite may to some extent be caused by such commensuration effects .",
    "an optimized localization potential might help to reduce them , hopefully allowing a more accurate calculation of the coherence length associated with the majorana fermion .     for a system of @xmath48 electrons with two qhs localized at the poles by @xmath2-function pinning potentials ;",
    "the lowest - energy state is the reference . ]        in the following , we use @xmath2-function pinning potentials .",
    "we first study what happens if only a single @xmath2-function is inserted in a system of @xmath49 electrons with two qhs , and whether they are still separated or if a single @xmath6-charged `` double quasihole '' is formed .",

    "1(a ) . in both cases",
    "the lowest - energy state has @xmath51 and describes two separated qhs localized at the poles .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows the same , but for a single @xmath2 function at the south pole .",
    "the lowest energy state has also @xmath51 , indicating that the qhs are still at maximal separation , which minimizes their coulomb repulsion : the qh pinned at the south pole repels the other to the north pole of the sphere . for increasing pinning strength",
    "some states with @xmath52 are reduced in energy . with strong enough pinning , a state with @xmath52 , in which qhs would cease to be maximally separated ,",
    "may become the lowest energy state .",
    "of particular interest is the state at @xmath53 which corresponds to a `` double qh '' with charge @xmath6 localized at the south pole , but no charge deficiency at the north pole . at @xmath0 , for coulomb interaction , this `` double qh '' state has quite large interaction energy and , except perhaps in the limit of very strong pinning , is unlikely to become the gs .",
    "we now turn to the study of ac for systems containing localized qhs .",
    "we begin with two qhs , pinned at the poles by @xmath2 functions , and we vary the particle interaction as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) from @xmath54 ( the coulomb case ) to near @xmath55 ( the mr limit ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolution of the excitation energies as function of the parameter @xmath40 for @xmath48 electrons and @xmath56 flux units ; other system sizes give similar results .",
    "the horizontal line at zero energy represents the gs energy : clearly none of the lines for the excited states come close to it and there is no mixing between them . thus there is no phase transition in going from the coulomb case to the mr limit , exactly as observed for systems without qhs.@xcite    next we investigate a system of @xmath57 electrons and @xmath58 flux quanta that contains @xmath59 localized qhs.@xcite this is particularly interesting because in the mr limit the gs is a degenerate doublet,@xcite which is associated with a majorana fermion @xcite and with the non - abelian braiding statistics of the qhs:@xcite for any four - qh configuration there are two linearly independent wave functions that describe it ; braiding qhs around each other induces a linear transformation in the degenerate subspace of the doublet . does this doublet survive in the coulomb limit ?    figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) show results for four qhs localized at the corners of a square on a great circle and at the vertices of a tetrahedron , respectively . in both cases",
    "we see that the two lowest - energy states close to the mr limit , i.e. , the gs at energy @xmath60 and the first excited state , remain the lowest - energy states over the entire parameter interval , even at the coulomb point @xmath54 . during the whole evolution",
    "there is neither crossing nor mixing with higher - lying states , indicating the absence of a phase transition .",
    "note that in the mr case , at @xmath55 , all the considered states have zero energy , because the pinning potential @xmath36 vanishes at this point .     for systems with four qhs localized at the vertices of a tetrahedron using the pinning potential in eq .",

    "4(d ) shows that this is actually not a problem : the coulomb spectrum is plotted as function of the strength of the pinning potential and it is evident that the near degeneracy is easily lifted by increasing the pinning strength .",
    "we also note that the two states of the doublet are not degenerate in the presence of a coulomb interaction but we expect the splitting to vanish in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite    the curves denoted by `` pfaffian '' in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) show the variational results for the splitting of the doublet , computed using the states at @xmath63 ( compare with baraban _",
    "@xcite ) : they overestimate the splitting in the coulomb limit , in the square geometry by a factor of @xmath64 and in the tetrahedral geometry by @xmath65 .    finally , fig .",
    "4(c ) shows the evolution of the overlaps @xmath66 of the two states @xmath67 of the doublet as the interaction varies from coulomb @xmath4 at @xmath54 to the vicinity of the three - body limit @xmath5 at @xmath63 .",
    "we see that there is no sign of an abrupt drop of the overlaps which could signal a phase transition , and the values reached near the mr limit are reasonably large for a system of this size ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "all these results provide evidence in favor of adiabatic continuity from the mr to the coulomb limit for the two lowest - energy states in systems with four localized qhs , suggesting that the non - abelian doublet , and the associated majorana fermion , can be expected in the limit of pure coulomb interaction",

    "one can pose the question if the permanent presence of the coulomb interaction ( that vanish as @xmath69 in the mr limit @xmath41 ) could influence our results , selecting exactly the `` right states '' from the zero energy states at the mr point . to strenghten our evidences and to show a complete ac between coulomb and mr limit",
    ", we repeat here the calculations for systems containing four qhs , using a different pinning potential @xmath36 that allows to reach both limits : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , interpolated between the @xmath33 and the @xmath35 ll like the electron interaction , is the coulomb potential of a pointlike object , e.g. , a stm tip , with a ( negative ) charge @xmath72 , positioned on the surface of the fqh sample.@xcite this potential repels the electrons from its center and , if the charge @xmath72 is chosen in an appropriate way , namely , in an interval near @xmath73 , it can only localize @xmath1-charged qhs , thus avoiding the problem of the localization of @xmath6-charged `` double qhs '' in the mr limit .",
    "this idea was first used by prodan and haldane @xcite in their investigation of the ( non - abelian ) braiding properties of mr qhs , although projecting the pinning potential on the zero energy space of their hamiltonian .",
    "figure 5 shows the results for the low - lying energy spectrum , as the interaction is varied from the coulomb ( @xmath54 ) to the mr limit ( @xmath55 ) , for systems with four qhs localized at the corners of a tetrahedron by four such pinning potentials .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "5(a ) are for @xmath48 electrons and a localizing charge @xmath74 , while in fig .",
    "5(b ) for @xmath57 electrons @xcite and @xmath75 : these charges were chosen in order to obtain that the two states of the mr doublet are exactly the lowest - lying states in the mr limit .    in both cases",
    "we see that ( once @xmath72 is fixed ) the two lowest energy states remain the lowest over the whole parameter interval ( for @xmath48 with a level crossing ) .",
    "the third energy level , corresponding to an excitation in the pinning potential , is exactly threefold degenerate ( for symmetry reasons ) and can thus be easily distinguished from the two lowest states forming the mr doublet .",
    "we note that this doublet has a finite energy splitting , not only for pure coulomb interaction , but also in the mr limit : this is caused by the pinning potential ( [ e/4 ] ) that mixes in states with nonzero energy .",
    "we also find that the energy separation between the upper state of the doublet and the third ( threefold degenerate ) state can be small , particularly in the mr limit , and depends on the charge @xmath72 used in the pinning potential .",
    "for example for @xmath57 electrons , using a localizing charge @xmath74 , the pinning potential is too strong and at the mr point the threefold degenerate state is slightly lower in energy than the upper state of the doublet ; to obtain the right order we chose a weaker potential , with @xmath75 .",
    "the ac between the coulomb and the mr limit for the lowest energy doublet shown in fig .",
    "5 thus supports the evidences of the previous section in favor of a `` survival '' of the majorana fermion till the coulomb point .    in fig .",
    "6 we also show the particle density on the surface of the sphere for the two states of the mr doublet in the two limiting cases : ( a ) , ( b ) for the mr and ( d ) , ( e ) for the coulomb limit .",
    "the two states of the doublet are indeed very similar , as also shown in ( c ) and ( f ) , where the density differences are plotted .",
    "note that the density differences in the mr case are approximately twice as large as the differences in the coulomb limit .",
    "in this last section we show some preliminary results of qh braiding and fusion in systems containing four localized qhs .",
    "we perform this investigation for electron interactions near to the coulomb limit , but slightly increasing @xmath76 , the haldane pseudopotential @xcite that describes the interaction between two particles having a relative angular momentum @xmath77 .",
    "in our previous work @xcite we showed that , under such interaction modifications , the system remains in the mr phase , even improving the overlap between the exact gs and the pfaffian wave function and simultaneously with an enhancement of the gap . for the qh localization we use the pinning potential introduced in the previous section [ eq .",

    "the non - abelian nature of the mr doublet states should become manifest : interchanging the positions of two qhs by stepwise changing the location of their pinning potentials ( and keeping the other two qhs fixed ) , the two states of the mr doublet should transform into each other , in particular , switching their position in the energy spectrum . for this to happen , during the qhs interchange process , an odd number of level crossings between them is needed . in the following calculations , we engineer an exact energy degeneracy for the two states of the doublet at the midpoint of the qhs interchange process , by choosing suited values for the localizing charge @xmath72 and the first haldane pseudotential @xmath76 .",

    "we keep qhs @xmath87 and @xmath88 fixed at their locations and , by stepwise changing the positions of the pinning potentials , we rotate both qh @xmath89 and @xmath7 around the vertical axis through the poles , @xmath90 keeping the polar angle @xmath91 constant , until they exchange their original positions : @xmath92 .",
    "this is a @xmath93-periodic process ; we call @xmath94 the `` braiding angle '' .",

    "these are `` reasonable '' values for @xmath72 and @xmath76 : the localized qhs have charge @xmath1 and the electron interaction is modified such that the system is still in the mr phase .",
    "figure 7 shows the evolution of the low lying energy spectrum as function of the braiding angle @xmath94 for ( a ) @xmath48 and ( b ) @xmath57 electrons . in both cases",
    "we observe that the two states of the doublet remain the lowest - energy states during the whole braiding process , never mixing with higher - lying states or with each other ( except at the degeneracy point ) . indeed",
    "the overlaps between the corresponding states of the doublet for successive braiding steps are consistently high : in the range @xmath98-@xmath99 for @xmath48 ( @xmath100 steps ) and @xmath99-@xmath101 for @xmath57 ( @xmath102 steps ) .    from the plots it is evident that the degeneracy point at @xmath97 is indeed also a crossing point for the two doublet states : if one follows the lines with a continuous derivative , at the degeneracy point one goes from the lower to the upper state of the doublet ( and vice versa ) .",
    "no other crossing or mixing point arises and thus the qh braiding causes an interchange in the mr doublet states : if one starts at @xmath103 in the lower - energy state , one ends at @xmath104 in the upper - energy state , as expected for non - abelian braiding statistics .",
    "two such braidings are needed to come back to the initial state .",
    "we note that we can get an exact degeneracy of the mr doublet only when the four qhs are in the tetrahedral configuration . slightly modifying the geometry of the configuration ,",
    "a small gap opens ; however , if the speed of the braiding is sufficiently high , the states of the mr doublet would still interchange at this point .",
    "this situation is analogous to that studied by thouless and gefen,@xcite concerning the crossing between the lowest - lying states as function of the magnetic flux , for the quantum hall effect at fractional fillings , showing that these crossings are essential in order to get a fractional charge . on the other hand",
    "if the qhs are moved in a strictly adiabatic way , the system always remains in the lowest - energy state , without crossing .",
    "we also wish to emphasize that the doublet degeneracy is very different from the threefold degeneracy of the first excited state : the former is obtained only by fine tuning of the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath76 , the latter is a purely geometric degeneracy , resulting from the symmetric qh configuration and independent from interaction and localization parameters .",
    "the fact that the mr doublet states are not degenerate ( except by tuning at @xmath97 ) in our small system diagonalizations helps us to follow their evolution during the braiding ( through the evolution of the energy levels ) and thus to recognize the crossing point which leads to the interchange of states .",
    "however we expect that in the thermodynamic limit the two states become exactly degenerate during the whole braiding process , when the qhs are sufficiently far apart from each other : on one side this would make the fine tuning of the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath105 unnecessary , but on the other side it would make it impossible , using our present method , to follow the evolution of the states under braiding ( however , it is still possible with a study of the monodromy matrix , as was done by prodan and haldane @xcite ) ; nevertheless , the interchange of the mr doublet states should survive also in this limit .",
    "unfortunately we can get results for qh braiding only for small system sizes @xcite and from them we can not extract useful information about the dependence of the energy splitting when approaching the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the average splitting of the mr doublet for @xmath57 is slightly smaller than for @xmath48 , but this is mainly caused by the different shape of the energy oscillations as function of the braiding angle @xmath94 in the two cases : for @xmath57 the oscillations of the mr doublet states are almost `` in phase '' , while for @xmath48 they are `` out of phase '' , thus giving a larger average splitting .",

    "we start from the tetrahedral configuration described above and we let fuse the two qhs in the upper half - sphere , by taking them to the north pole , that is , by shrinking the polar angle @xmath106 from @xmath107 to @xmath100 at fixed azimuthal angles . figure 8 shows the low - lying energy spectrum as function of the polar angle @xmath95 during this process , for @xmath57 electrons .",
    "we see that , after that the degeneracy is lifted , the evolution of the two lowest states is similar , with a relatively constant splitting between them .",
    "this splitting ( or at least a part of it ) could come from the intrinsic splitting of the mr doublet as two qhs are taken together ( its order of magnitude is the same as that obtained by baraban _ _ et al.__@xcite ) .",
    "however , at approximately @xmath108 , the upper state of the mr doublet comes very near to the next higher - lying state and strongly mixes with it @xcite ( but without crossing ) , possibly losing a part of its character .",
    "thus it is not fully clear what happens at the mr doublet , and further investigations are needed .",
    "our results provide evidence in favor of adiabatic continuity from the moore - read to the coulomb limit for the two lowest - energy states in systems with four localized qhs and thus the non - abelian doublet and associated majorana fermion can be expected in the limit of pure coulomb interaction .",
