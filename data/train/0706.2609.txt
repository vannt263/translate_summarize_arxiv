    "current and forthcoming particle collider experiments involve very high energies , such that the momentum fractions @xmath0 of initial state partons are extremely small .",
    "the splitting functions that govern the evolution of parton densities @xmath2 with momentum scale @xmath3 , together with the coefficients that relate these partons to proton structure functions , are unstable at low bjorken @xmath0 values due to terms behaving like @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "although the standard dglap theory ( where the splitting and coefficient functions are considered at a fixed order in @xmath6 ) works well in parton fits , there is some evidence that a resummation of small @xmath0 logarithms is necessary .",
    "previous work has shown that a ll analysis fails to describe data well .",
    "one resums small @xmath0 logarithms in the gluon density by solving the _ bfkl equation _",
    "@xcite , an integral equation for the unintegrated gluon 4-point function .",
    "one then relates this gluon to structure functions using the @xmath7 factorisation formalism  @xcite to obtain the resummed splitting and coefficient functions .      introducing the double mellin transformed unintegrated gluon density : @xmath8",
    "the nll bfkl equation in @xmath9 space is a double differential equation in @xmath10 : @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the derivatives in @xmath10 arise from the use of the lo running coupling @xmath13 in momentum space , and @xmath14 is the mellin transform of the @xmath15-order bfkl kernel .",
    "one may solve this to give : @xmath16 for some @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "one would ideally like to factorise the perturbative from the non - perturbative physics to make contact with the collinear factorisation framework .",
    "this can be achieved ( up to power - suppressed corrections ) by shifting the lower limit of the integral in equation ( [ sol ] ) from @xmath19",
    ". then one finds for the integrated gluon : @xmath20 where the perturbative piece is : @xmath21d\\gamma,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 can be derived from @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a known function of @xmath10 .",
    "structure functions have a similar form : @xmath26d\\gamma,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is a nll order impact factor coupling the virtual photon with the bfkl gluon .",
    "if all impact factors are known , one can derive all necessary splitting and coefficient functions in double mellin space ( within a particular factorisation scheme ) by taking ratios of the above quantities .",
    "the non - perturbative dependence then cancels , and one obtains results in momentum and @xmath0 space by performing the inverse mellin integrals either numerically or analytically .",
    "the exact nll impact factors are not in fact known , but the ll results supplemented with the correct kinematic behaviour of the gluon have been calculated  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that one expects them to approximate well the missing nll information in the true impact factors  @xcite . +",
    "consistent implementation of small @xmath0 resummations in the massive sector requires the definition of a variable flavour number scheme that allows the massive impact factors to be disentangled in terms of heavy coefficient functions and matrix elements .",
    "we have devised such a scheme , the dis(@xmath28 ) scheme  @xcite . with resummations in both the massive and massless sectors ,",
    "one has everything necessary to carry out a global fit to dis and related data .",
    "first , the resummed splitting and coefficient functions are combined with the nlo dglap results using the prescription : @xmath29,\\ ] ] where the subtractions remove the double counted terms , namely the lo and nlo ( in @xmath6 ) parts of the resummed results .",
    "then the resulting improved splitting and coefficient functions interpolate between the resummed results at low @xmath0 , and the conventional dglap results at high @xmath0 .",
    "the resummed splitting functions @xmath30 ( @xmath31 at small @xmath0 ) and @xmath32 are shown in figure [ pgg ] .",
    "one sees that the ll bfkl results are much more divergent than the standard nlo results , which are known to describe data well .",
    "the addition of the running coupling to the ll bfkl equation suppresses this divergence , but it is still unacceptable .",
    "inclusion of the nll bfkl kernel , however , leads to a significant dip of the splitting functions below the nlo results .",
    "this dip is also observed in other resummation approaches  @xcite and has an important consequence in the global fit in that it resolves the tension between the tevatron jet data ( which favour a larger high @xmath0 gluon ) and the h1 and zeus data ( which prefer a higher low @xmath0 gluon ) . by momentum conservation , one can not increase the gluon at both low and high @xmath0 in a standard nlo dglap fit .",
    "this is possible in the resummed approach , due to the dip in the splitting functions .",
    "+          indeed , the gluon distribution at the parton input scale of @xmath33 is positive definite over the entire @xmath0 range .",
    "this is in contrast to a nlo fit , where the gluon distribution is negative at small @xmath0 for low @xmath3 values .",
    "whilst a negative gluon is not disallowed , it can lead to negative structure functions which are unphysical .",
    "the resummed gluon , however , leads to a prediction for the longitudinal structure function that is positive and growing at small @xmath0 and @xmath3 , in contrast to fixed order results which show a significant perturbative instability . +",
    "a consequence of a more sensible description for @xmath34 is that a turnover is observed in the reduced cross - section @xmath35\\,f_l$ ] at high @xmath1 .",
    "as seen in figure [ redxsec ] , this is required by the hera data .",
    "furthermore , this feature is missing in nlo fits ( but present at nnlo ) .",
    "thus the resummations lead to qualitatively different behaviour , consistent with known consequences of higher orders in the fixed order expansion .",
    "overall , we find very compelling evidence of the need for bfkl effects in describing proton structure @xcite .",
