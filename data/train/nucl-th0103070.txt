    "in the study of nuclear structure properties , nuclear masses or binding energies ( @xmath2 ) and , more in particular , two - neutron separation energies ( @xmath3 ) , are interesting probes to find out about specific nuclear structure correlations that are present in the nuclear ground state . these correlations ,",
    "to a large extent , express the global behavior that is most easily seen in a global way and as such , the liquid drop model ( ldm ) serves as a first guide to match to the observed trends concerning nuclear ground - state masses @xcite .",
    "there have been extensive global mass studies carried out which aim , in particular , at reproducing the overall trends : from pure liquid - drop model studies ( ldm ) @xcite , over macroscopic - microscopic methods @xcite , over the semi - classical etfsi ( extended thomas - fermi plus strutinsky integral ) @xcite , towards , more recently , relativistic mean - field @xcite , and skyrme hartree - fock studies @xcite .",
    "it is our aim to concentrate on local correlations that are rather small on the absolute energy scale used to describe binding energies ( or two - neutron separation energies ) but nevertheless point out to a number of interesting extra nuclear structure effects .",
    "these can come from various origins such as ( i ) the presence of closed - shell discontinuities , ( ii ) the appearance of local zones of deformation , and ( iii ) configuration mixing or shape mixing that shows up in the nuclear ground state itself .",
    "except for the closed - shell discontinuities , the other effects give rise to small energy changes , about @xmath4  kev or less , that were not observed in experiments until recently .",
    "however , in the last few years a dramatic increase in the experimental sensitivity , using trap devices or specific mass - measurement set - ups ( isoltrap , mistral , @xmath5 ) @xcite , has shifted the level of accuracy down to a few tens of kev ( typically @xmath6  kev for nuclei in the pb region ) such that mass measurements are now of the level to indicate local correlation energies that allow to test nuclear models ( shell - model studies ) @xcite . therefore , interest has been growing considerably and we aim at discussing and analysing , from this point of view , recent mass measurements .    in the first part of the present paper , we discuss the collective ( or global ) features of the nuclear binding energy ( or the @xmath3 observable ) using a simple liquid - drop model ( section [ sec - ldm - be ] ) and some general properties of the shell model ( section [ sec - shell - be ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec - ibm - be ] we concentrate on a description of binding energies within the framework of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) , where , besides a study of the global aspects of @xmath3 , the specific nuclear structure correlations ( local part ) are studied in , and close to , the symmetry limits @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "special attention is given to obtain a consistent description of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) values when crossing the mid - shell point .",
    "applications for the @xmath0 shell are presented in some detail . in the second part of the paper ( section [ sec - intru ] ) we concentrate on local modifications of the otherwise smooth @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) behavior that come from the presence of low - lying intruder states at and near closed shells .",
    "we discuss the effect in both , an approximate ibm configuration mixing approach , as well as by studying , in some detail , the macroscopic - microscopic model giving rise to the potential energy surfaces ( pes ) .",
    "we apply and discuss both calculations for nuclei in the neutron - deficient pb region .",
    "finally , in section [ sec - conclu ] we present a number of conclusions .",
    "nuclear masses and the derived quantity , the two - neutron separation energy , @xmath3 , form important indicators that may show the presence of extra correlations on top of a smooth liquid - drop behavior .",
    "@xmath3 is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the binding energy defined as positive , ( _ i.e. _  it is the positive of the energy of the ground state of the atomic nucleus ) for a nucleus with @xmath12 nucleons and @xmath13 protons .",
    "the simplest ldm @xcite will be used as a reference point throughout this paper because it allows the overall description of the _ be _ along the whole table of masses , or for long series of isotopes .",
    "more sophisticated macroscopic - microscopic finite - range droplet models , using a folded - yukawa single - particle potential have been developed @xcite and extensive mass tables published @xcite . here , the global trends , even passing through regions of deformed nuclei , have been well described .",
    "deviations that result , usually point towards new local nuclear structure effects .",
    "the present computing possibilities have resulted in modern state - of - the - art mass tables spanning semi - classical eftsi methods @xcite , over self - consistent relativistic mean - field models @xcite , towards a recent skyrme hartree - fock study @xcite .",
    "those mass calculations serve as benchmarks for the whole nuclear mass region but local nuclear structure correlations , as well as the exact location of the onset of deformation stay outside the `` philosophy '' and scope of these important studies .      to see how the values of @xmath3 evolve globally , through the complete mass chart",
    ", we start from can the semi - empirical mass formula @xcite , @xmath14 even though there exist much refined macroscopic models ( see references given before ) , the present simple liquid - drop model ( [ ldm ] ) is a suitable starting point for our purpose in analysing the physics behind the @xmath3 systematics .",
    "the @xmath3 value can be written as , @xmath15 where the surface and coulomb terms are only approximated expressions . if one inserts the particular value of @xmath13 , @xmath16 , that maximises the binding energy for each given @xmath12 ( this is the definition for the valley of stability ) , @xmath17 we obtain , for large values of @xmath12 , the result ( see @xcite ) , @xmath18 in the present form , we use the following values for the ldm parameters : @xmath19 = @xmath20 mev , @xmath21 = @xmath22 mev , @xmath23 = @xmath24 mev and @xmath25 = @xmath26 mev @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig - s2n - ldm - exp ] , we illustrate the behavior of @xmath3 along the valley of stability ( [ s2n - vs ] ) for even - even nuclei , together with the experimental data .",
    "the experimental data correspond to a range of @xmath13 between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it appears that the overall decrease and the specific mass dependence is well contained within the liquid - drop model .",
    "we can also see how well the experimental two - neutron separation energy , through a chain of isotopes , is reproduced using the ldm . from fig .",
    "[ fig - s2n - ldm - exp ] , it is clear that , besides the sudden variations near mass number @xmath29 ( presence of shell closure at @xmath30 ) and near mass number @xmath31 ( presence of the shell closure at @xmath32 ) , the specific mass dependence for series of isotopes comes closer to specific sets of straight lines .",
    "next , we observe that the mass formula ( [ ldm ] ) is able to describe the observed almost linear behavior of @xmath3 for series of isotopes . the more appropriate way of carrying out this analysis is to make an expansion of the different terms in ( [ ldm ] ) around a particular value of @xmath12 ( or @xmath33 , because @xmath13 is fixed ) , @xmath34 , and to keep the main orders .",
    "therefore , we define @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "let us start with the volume term , @xmath37 the surface term gives rise to , @xmath38 and the contribution of the coulomb term is , @xmath39 finally , the asymmetry contribution is , @xmath40 first , it is clear that the coefficients of the linear part are ( for @xmath41 and @xmath42 and taking for @xmath19 , @xmath21 @xmath23 , and @xmath25 the values given in previous section ) about two orders of magnitude larger than the coefficients of the quadratic contribution . with respect to the second order terms",
    "it is interesting to see the value of each of them : the surface term gives @xmath43 mev , the coulomb term @xmath44 mev , and the asymmetry term @xmath45 mev . as a consequence , in this case , the leading term is the asymmetry one and it is essentially the main source of non - linearities in the @xmath2 and therefore , the source of the slope of the @xmath3 . in order to illustrate these results , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig - ldm - contrib ] the different contributions of the ldm ( volume , volume plus surface , volume plus surface plus coulomb and volume plus surface plus coulomb plus asymmetry term ) to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 for different families of isotopes .",
    "it thus appears that only the asymmetry term induces the quadratic behavior in @xmath2 and the linear one in @xmath3 .    in eq .",
    "( [ s2n - vs ] ) we make use of the classical values as discussed in the early papers of wapstra @xcite .",
    "this fit , of course , was constrained to a relatively small set of experimental data points .",
    "more recent fits , including ( i ) higher - order terms in the ldm , _",
    "e.g. _  the surface symmetry correction , a finite - range surface term , droplet correction , etc .  and ( ii ) the much extended range of experimental data points , seem to give rise to an increased asymmetry energy coefficient @xmath46 with values of the order of @xmath47 mev @xcite .",
    "we show , in fig .",
    "[ fig - ldm - contrib ] , the results obtained using an increased @xmath46 coefficient , which gives rise to an increased in the absolute value of the @xmath3 slope .    in the present analysis , we have left out the effect of the pairing energy , with a dependence @xmath48 @xcite , because the net result is an overall shift in the binding energy , but the relative variation in the @xmath3 values , over a mass span of @xmath49 units , is of the order of @xmath50 kev and , as such , is not essential for the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig - ldm - contrib ] .",
    "finally it should be stressed that , far from stability and for very neutron - rich nuclei , the asymmetry term can be at the origin of a decreasing trend in the @xmath2 when @xmath12 further increases .",
    "this actually corresponds to the well known drip - line phenomenon , but here within a pure ldm approach .",
    "within the liquid drop model ( ldm ) description of the binding energy of atomic nuclei , the volume term , the surface and coulomb energy contributions give rise to an essentially flat behavior in the @xmath3 values .",
    "it is the asymmetry term that accounts for an almost linear drop in the quantity @xmath3 within a given isotopic series as a function of the nucleon ( or neutron ) number @xmath12 ( or @xmath33 ) .",
    "this expresses the progressively decreasing binding energy needed to remove a pair of nucleons out of a given nucleus .",
    "the asymmetry term shows up already when treating the nucleus as a fermi gas of independent particles , as a consequence of the pauli principle .",
    "the linear drop in @xmath3 also shows up in a more realistic shell - model description of nucleons moving in an average field , characterised by the single - particle spectrum @xmath51 , that are subsequently coupled to @xmath52 pairs because of the major attractive binding - energy correlation on top of the monopole binding - energy term .",
    "to fix the idea , one should start from a doubly - closed shell nucleus as a reference nucleus in order to describe binding energies ( or separation energies ) and then treat the interactions amongst nucleons filling a given single-@xmath53 shell .",
    "talmi has shown @xcite that , for a zero - range force ( @xmath54-function interaction ) using a pair - coupled wave function that has seniority @xmath55 as a good quantum number , the contribution to the ground - state configuration can be expressed as @xmath56 or @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the attractive @xmath1 two - body matrix element .",
    "this binding energy contribution is essentially equal to the volume part of the liquid - drop model formulation ( which scales like @xmath12 ) , and scales with the number of interacting valence nucleons moving in the single-@xmath53 shell - model orbital and contributes with a constant value to the @xmath3 two - neutron separation energy .",
    "more general interactions ( finite range forces , the standard pairing force ,  ) contribute with extra terms in the expression of the binding energy @xcite .",
    "coupling of the ground - state seniority @xmath59 with higher - lying seniority @xmath60 configurations also modifies this most simple expression given in ( [ be - delta2 ] ) .",
    "this then leads to a general diagonal energy that also contains a term quadratic in the number of nucleons @xmath61 ( the specific coefficients depend on the specific forces and coupling ) and is given as @xcite @xmath62p,\\ ] ] provided the seniority @xmath55 is a good quantum number . here , @xmath63 $ ] stands for the largest integer not bigger than @xmath64 .",
    "further , @xmath65 is in general large and attractive ( @xmath66 with @xmath67 mev and @xmath68 @xmath69 , with @xmath69 the pairing force strength ) , @xmath70 is much smaller and repulsive ( in agreement with the sign of the asymmetry term in the liquid - drop energy expression ) and @xmath71 describes the odd - even pairing staggering to the binding - energy expression ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - be - sm ] ) .",
    "thus , it is the @xmath70 contribution that causes a linear drop in the @xmath3 value as a function of the nucleon number .",
    "this expression has been used to fit @xmath3 values in various mass regions @xcite .",
    "this shell - model behavior actually describes the long stretches of linear behavior in the @xmath3 curve over a large region of the nuclear mass table , indicating that the above simple structure contains the correct physics and saturation properties of the nucleon - nucleon two - body interactions . from the above discussion",
    ", it becomes clear that , in order to correctly reproduce the experimental @xmath3 behavior over a large series of isotopes , one needs a good description of the single - particle energies @xmath51 and their variation over a given mass region .",
    "the monopole term @xcite is essential in order to correctly reproduce saturation in the nuclear binding starting from a pure shell - model approach , _",
    "i.e. _  if one starts out , _ e.g. _  with the single - particle energies in the @xmath72 shell - model space around @xmath73o and considers the variation in these single - particle energies through the monopole proton - neutron contribution @xmath74 one should reproduce the observed relative energy spacing in the @xmath72 shell when reaching the end of the shell near @xmath75ca .",
    "we shall not start to discuss detailed shell - model calculations here but we like to refer to the very good reproduction of the overall behavior in the @xmath3 value when crossing the full _ sd _ shell - model region @xcite , except near @xmath76 and for the ne , na , and mg nuclei @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we shall carry out a more detailed study of @xmath3 properties with a shell - model space that is truncated to that part which mainly determines the low - lying collective properties , _",
    "i.e. _  we will perform the ibm symmetry truncation .",
    "we expect essentially to recover the shell - model features as described here .",
    "the ibm will allow , however , a more detailed study covering large sets of isotopes in the nuclear mass table .",
    "the interacting boson model @xcite takes advantage of the group theory for describing low - lying states of even - even nuclei .",
    "such states present a clear _ quadrupole _ collectivity .",
    "the building blocks of the model are bosons with angular momentum @xmath77 ( @xmath78 bosons ) and angular momentum @xmath79 ( @xmath80 bosons ) .",
    "the number of interacting bosons that are present in the system corresponds to half the number of valence nucleons , @xmath81 , and they interact through a hamiltonian containing , in the simplest case , up to two - body interactions , being number conserving and rotationally invariant .",
    "the original version of the model is called ibm-1 and in this approach no difference is considered between protons and neutrons @xcite . in this section",
    "we use the ibm-1 version of the model .    in the last few decades",
    "the ibm has provided a satisfactory description of spectra and transitions rates of medium - mass and heavy nuclei @xcite . however in most of the cases the binding energy has not been considered in the analysis . in a recent paper @xcite it was pointed out that it is extremely important to include the @xmath2 , or equivalently the @xmath3 values , in an ibm study because its value is very sensitive to the hamiltonian that it is used .",
    "therefore , it is very useful for choosing the most appropriate hamiltonian in the description of a given nucleus . as was shown by garca - ramos _ et al . _ in ref .",
    "@xcite and will be recapitulated here , in order to study the binding - energy properties , it is necessary to analyse a complete chain of isotopes and not a single nucleus , which makes the study more complicated .    at this point",
    "it is convenient to write the definition of @xmath3 . in case we use nucleon particles outside of a closed shell ,",
    "we define ( remind , @xmath33 denotes the number of nucleon pairs outside of closed shells , not to be confused with the neutron number ) : @xmath82 when using a description in terms of holes inside a closed shell , the definition of @xmath3 becomes , @xmath83 later ( section [ sec - mid ] ) , we shall present a prescription that contains only a single definition .    for later use ( section [ sec - real ] ) we present here a very compact ibm hamiltonian that will be used throughout this section .",
    "this hamiltonian is not the most general one but is ideal for the purpose of studying binding energies and allows to describe many realistic situations @xcite .",
    "it can be written as follows , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the @xmath80 boson number operator and @xmath86 the symbol @xmath87 represents the scalar product . here the scalar product of two operators with angular momentum @xmath88 is defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 corresponds to the @xmath91 component of the operator @xmath92 .",
    "the operator @xmath93 ( where @xmath94 refers to @xmath78 and @xmath80 bosons ) is introduced to ensure the tensorial character under spatial rotations .",
    "note that in realistic calculations @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "it is common in this approach to use for the @xmath97 transition operator the form @xmath98 in which @xmath99 denotes the effective charge and @xmath100 has the same structure as in the hamiltonian ( [ q ] ) .",
    "this approximation is the basis of the so - called consistent-@xmath101 formalism ( cqf ) @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) generates the spectrum of the nucleus and in the following will be called `` local hamiltonian '' .",
    "an extra part can be added to this hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) without affecting the spectrum , that will be called `` global hamiltonian '' .    in the description of @xmath2",
    "using the ibm one has to distinguish between two contributions : a global ( rather big ) part that corresponds to the bulk energy of the atomic nucleus , should change slowly ( @xmath102 ) and comes from the `` global hamiltonian '' , and a local ( rather small ) part coming from the specific structure of the given nuclei ( @xmath103 ) , _ i.e. _  coming from the `` local hamiltonian '' .",
    "however , the global part has to be added _",
    "ad hoc _ using a given prescription that will be presented in this section .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the ibm global part comes from the ldm , and somehow , both contributions must be related . for the different series of isotopes they result into a quadratic behavior in @xmath2 and a linear one in @xmath3 .",
    "this ibm description resembles the strutinsky method @xcite in the sense that a part ( global part ) takes care of the main part of the @xmath2 , while a second part ( local part ) modifies this bulk @xmath2 and generates the spectrum of the nucleus .",
    "the global part of the @xmath2 in the ibm ( @xmath102 ) comes from that part of the hamiltonian that does not affect the internal excitation energies .",
    "those terms are related with the casimir operators of @xmath104 , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath105 $ ] and @xmath106 $ ] and can be written in terms of the total number of bosons , @xmath107 , @xmath108 its contribution to the binding energy reads as , @xmath109 the corresponding contribution to @xmath3 is linear in the number of bosons : @xmath110 in order to avoid ambiguities it is assumed in these expressions that @xmath33 always corresponds to the number of nucleons pairs , considered as particles and is never considered as holes .",
    "we come back to this delicate aspect in section [ sec - mid ] .    in the latter expressions ,",
    "it is implicit that the coefficients @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are constant for chains of isotopes ( fixed @xmath13 ) when the value of @xmath33 changes , except when crossing the mid - shell or passing between major shells , _",
    "i.e. _  it provides a linear contribution .",
    "however , this assumption is not clear _ a priori_. to find a mathematical proof of the constancy of @xmath111 and @xmath112 is a difficult task .",
    "however , one can find a number of arguments based on ldm , shell - model , and ibm itself , that imply such a constancy .    * a ldm argument : in section [ sec - ldm - be ] we noticed that the ldm gives a satisfactory global description of the @xmath2 throughout the whole mass table .",
    "this description can not reproduce fine details , but it is able to explain the observed linear behavior of @xmath3 for series of isotopes .",
    "this behavior is the same as the one obtained from ( [ s2n - gl - ibm ] ) , using @xmath111 and @xmath112 constants , and therefore supports our hypothesis . *",
    "a shell - model argument : another justification is based on the shell - model , in particular in the use of the modified surface - delta - interaction ( msdi ) .",
    "it is well known that the surface delta interaction ( sdi ) gives a good description of energy spectra although it also results in a number of systematic discrepancies with respect to the reproduction of the experimental levels .",
    "this discrepancy is especially notable for nuclear binding energies .",
    "it was shown that this description could be largely improved when changing the position of the energy centroids for the multiplets with different isospin .",
    "the modification of the interaction gave rise to the msdi @xcite .",
    "the most important point for our present discussion is that this new element in the two - body interaction , if one keeps the parameters constant , gives rise to a quadratic dependence in the nuclear binding energy , equivalent to the one we obtain in eq .",
    "( [ be - gl - ibm ] ) .",
    "* an ibm argument : a third justification comes from an ibm analysis .",
    "it will be shown in sections [ sec - calc - ab ] and [ sec - real ] that our _ ansatz _ provides an extremely good description of @xmath3 for chains of isotopes in the region from @xmath114 to @xmath115      the local contribution to the @xmath2 ( @xmath103 ) comes from the ibm hamiltonian that gives rise to the nuclear spectrum .",
    "this local contribution should be added to the fully linear part presented in previous subsection . a first approximation to this hamiltonian comes from studying the symmetry limits of the model .",
    "such limiting hamiltonians do not correspond to realistic hamiltonians but can be used as a good starting point . in the present discussion ,",
    "the parameters of the different local hamiltonians are kept constant , which is not a realistic hypothesis for long chains of isotopes .",
    "note that the global hamiltonian remains unchanged for the whole chain .",
    "therefore , the following results will be applicable if we cut the chain of isotopes into smaller intervals and if we change the value of the parameters of the local hamiltonian only between intervals .",
    "the symmetry limits , called dynamical symmetries of the ibm , correspond to particular choices of the hamiltonian that give rise to analytic expressions for the energy spectra ( which is the reason of its usefulness ) .",
    "at the same time the eigenstates exhibit certain symmetries that allow to classify them in a simple way .",
    "the symmetry limits appear when the hamiltonian is written in terms of a particular combination of casimir operators .",
    "next we succinctly review the three cases that were discussed before @xcite .    *",
    "the local hamiltonian that gives rise to the @xmath7 symmetry limit can be written as , @xmath116 + \\alpha\\ ,   \\hat c_2 [ u(5 ) ] +   \\beta\\ , \\hat c_2 [ o(5 ) ] + \\gamma\\ , \\hat c_2 [ o(3)],\\ ] ] where @xmath117 $ ] stands for the casimir operator of order @xmath61 of the group @xmath69",

    "it should be noted that the local contribution to @xmath3 is again linear in the number of bosons .",
    "this contribution should be added to the global part of the hamiltonian .    at this point , it should become clear that the local ibm hamiltonian , corresponding to the three dynamical symmetries , does not change the linear behavior of @xmath3 ( coming from the global part ) . in the case of the @xmath7 limit",
    "there is no extra contribution to @xmath3 , while for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 limits only a change in the values of the slope and the intercept of @xmath3 is introduced .",
    "the analysis should only be valid within the smaller intervals and thus non - linear behavior in @xmath3 could appear if the character of the nuclei , along a series of isotopes , is changing from one symmetry limit into another one .",
    "an extra source for deviations of a linear behavior arises when the parameters of the local hamiltonian themselves do change from one nucleus to another nucleus , even preserving the dynamical symmetry .",
    "note that the global contribution remains linear .      in this subsection",
    "we complete the previous analysis , but now we study more complex situations albeit still in an analytical approximation .",
    "this will form a good starting point in order to carry out a complete numerical analysis of @xmath3 using the ibm .    here , we consider the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) , which will prove to be extremely useful for our purpose .",
    "this hamiltonian encompasses the three symmetry limits for particular choices of the parameters and the so called transitional regions .",
    "the transitional regions are intermediate situations between the symmetry limits , where one observes rapid structural changes in the nuclei .",
    "one can identify three different transitional regions : ( a ) structural changes between spherical ( @xmath7 ) and well deformed nuclei ( @xmath8 ) ; ( b ) structural changes from spherical ( @xmath7 ) to @xmath94-unstable nuclei ( @xmath9 ) and ( c ) structural changes from well - deformed ( @xmath8 ) to @xmath94-unstable nuclei ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "one observes that the borders of the transitional regions correspond to the dynamical symmetries ( indicated between parenthesis ) .",
    "the idea here is to consider the main part of the local hamiltonian corresponding to a given symmetry limit plus a small correction term that allows us to explore the transitional region and that can be treated using perturbation theory .",
    "next , we discuss three different situations depending on the main part of the local hamiltonian .    *",
    "the vibrational limit appears when @xmath141 in hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) . if @xmath142 the wave function ( [ sta - u5 ] ) is only an approximate solution to the problem if @xmath143 .",
    "the result is in principle independent of @xmath144 , but performing a simple analysis , one notices that the range of applicability of the results depends on @xmath144 .",
    "so , if one numerically diagonalizes the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) for @xmath145 and for different values of @xmath146 , one obtains that , even for a ratio equal to @xmath147 and with @xmath148 , the overlap @xmath149 , n_d=0 , v=0 , l=0 \\rangle$ ] is equal to @xmath150 . for @xmath151",
    "this overlap equals @xmath152 , and for @xmath153 it equals @xmath154 .",
    "so it becomes clear that the range of applicability is quite narrow and even diminishes when @xmath155 increases .",

    "even though detailed calculations may well turn out to have a serious sensitivity to the choice of parameters describing the hamiltonians corresponding to the two subspaces @xcite , the general outcome remains very stable and gives the possibility to obtain ( i ) low - lying @xmath1 intruder states that exhibit a very specific mass dependence , approximately described by the expression @xcite @xmath262 which expresses the extra binding energy that results from the interaction of the extra proton pairs , @xmath263 , with the valence neutron pairs , @xmath264 , using a quadrupole - quadrupole proton - neutron interaction with @xmath126 as the force strength ( see fig .",

    "calculations have been carried out for the po isotopes with the aim of understanding the rapid lowering of an excited @xmath269 state and the band on top of that @xcite . using a @xmath196 dynamical symmetry coupling ( ds ) ( using two different sets of coupling matrices ) and also a more general ibm-1 hamiltonian for the intruder excitations ( g ) @xcite , we have studied the influence of mixing on the ground - state binding energy and thus on the @xmath3 values .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig - mix - po ] that the overall trend is rather well reproduced and that in the lightest po nucleus , where data are obtained , albeit with a large error bar , a local drop of about @xmath270 kev to @xmath271 kev results , depending on how states are mixing ( for more details see @xcite ) .    in the pb nuclei ,",
    "no specific structure effects outside of a linear variation in @xmath3 show up except at the lowest neutron number observed at present .",
    "this is consistent with the excitation energy of the lowest @xmath269 intruder state not dropping much below @xmath272 mev @xcite .",
    "the measured very slow @xmath273 decay rates in the pb nuclei @xcite are consistent with a very weak mixing into the ground state and thus without local binding energy increase .",
    "calculations in the pt nuclei @xcite , using similar methods , in the region where the two different families of states come close and interact with typical mixing matrix elements for the @xmath269 states of @xmath274 kev , result in a specific variation in the mass dependence of @xmath3 values consistent with the observed data .",
    "independent studies that have attempted to extract the mixing matrix element between the ground - state and intruder - band members , all come close to this value of @xmath274 kev as mixing matrix element giving a consistent explanation @xcite .    even though it is not possible to derive every single detail of the local @xmath3 variations , all studies and the various results on ground - to - intruder band state mixing point towards the interpretation that it is a localised interaction between the ground state and the specific low - lying intruder @xmath269 states which is at the origin of the observed effects .",
    "moreover , there is a clear correlation between the energy where the ground - state and intruder states have a closest approach and the maximal deviation in @xmath3 from a linear variation .      instead of describing binding energies from a shell - model approach ( standard large - scale shell - model calculations or the ibm approximation in which the interactions amongst pairs form the central ingredients ) , one can use a different method . here , we start from a model that combines the macroscopic part of the total energy , with a microscopic part .",
    "this latter part contains the nuclear shell and pairing correlations near to the fermi level @xcite . in shorthand notation",
    ", the total binding energy can be written as @xmath275 the latter method is called the strutinsky renormalization method and has been applied in many mass regions ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the macroscopic part of the total energy was assumed to be given by a yukawa - plus - exponential mass formula of mller and nix @xcite .",
    "the shell correction was calculated using the axially - deformed single - particle woods - saxon potential @xcite , with parameters as outlined if refs .",
    "this average potential has been used previously to determine equilibrium shapes of coexisting configurations @xcite in the pt - ra region @xcite .",

    "a standard seniority pairing force has been used .",
    "the pairing strengths ( for protons and neutrons ) used here were those of ref .",
    "@xcite . to avoid",
    "the well - known problems associated with the bcs treatment of pairing in the region of low level densities , approximate number projection was performed by means of the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) method @xcite .",
    "the energies of the local minima in the potential energy surface ( pes ) were obtained by performing a minimisation with respect to the @xmath280 and @xmath281 deformations for each value of the quadrupole deformation @xmath282    potential energy surface calculations ( pes ) for a series of isotopes in the pb region ( the po , pt , pb and hg isotopes ) have been carried out before @xcite with the aim of studying shape coexistence in the pb region .",
    "properties of the pt , hg , pb , and po nuclei are also discussed in the mass tables of mller _ et al . _",

    "_ @xcite .    in the calculation of the pes ,",
    "an absolute and several local minima can occur , corresponding to a regular state ( @xmath283 ) and to deformed states ( @xmath284 ) .",
    "since here , we are interested in two - neutron separation energies , both the binding energies , _ i.e. _  the absolute minimum , as well as the excitation energies of the local , deformed minima are important . in going from nucleus @xmath285 to the adjacent nucleus , @xmath286 , in order to derive the @xmath3 value",
    ", one has to take differences between the lowest total energy values for the nuclei that are considered ( in absolute value ) .",
    "the method is illustrated in fig  [ fig - tpe - method ] .",
    "we like to discuss in the next two paragraphs the precision with which @xmath3 can be calculated and this is important in the light of later applications to nuclei in the pb region .    when searching for minima in the potential energy surface ( pes ) , as a function of deformation , a rather dense mesh was used : @xmath287 .",
    "the behavior obtained was smooth and differences between energy values for neighbouring deformation points were of the order of a few kev , at least close to the minimum .",
    "therefore , the computational error of the minimum energy can be estimated as not exceeding 1 or 2 kev .",
    "of course , the error introduced by approximations of the method itself ( e.g. , by only approximate fulfilment of the plateau condition or by use of simple lipkin - nogami method for pairing correlations @xcite ) is much larger , closer to 1 mev .",
    "however , one can expect that taking only differences between energies and not their absolute values cancels these errors substantially .",
    "inaccuracies could also be introduced through the dependence of energy on strutinsky s parameters @xmath94 ( `` smoothing range '' ) and @xmath288 ( order of polynomial expansion used in smoothing procedure ) .",
    "as discussed in detail in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , even for not very exotic nuclei , the plateau condition with respect to these parameters is never fulfilled exactly .",
    "a change in @xmath94 by @xmath289 can induce a change in shell energy of the order of 1 mev in a rather irregular way depending on the detailed structure of the single - particle spectrum . as a change in nucleon number by 2 gives rise to a change of shell energy of the order of up to a few mev",
    ", the uncertainties caused by lack of ideal plateau condition can be quite substantial .",
    "again , they are mainly smoothed out by taking differences between adjacent even - even nuclei only .",
    "such irregularities are most likely to show up when deformation changes in passing from one nucleus to the heavier or lighter by 2 nucleons , because the single particle - spectrum is then different for the two nuclei .",
    "this latter effect might be partly responsible for the presence of some irregularities ( the smaller spikes as seen , e.g. , in fig .",
    "20 for the pt nuclei ) .    in the next subsection , we compare these results with the experimental values .",
    "one has to stress from the beginning that pes calculations can , at best , give a qualitative description of binding energy differences ( @xmath3 values ) .",
    "dynamical effects obtained by solving a collective schrdinger equation are not taken care of ( no mixing effects between close - lying @xmath1 are taken into account when making differences of pes values , purely ) , in the present discussion .",
    "going beyond the standard method of calculating pes , one needs to account for mixing of the non - degenerate mean - field solutions .",
    "this can be done using the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , originally developed be hill , wheeler and griffin @xcite .",
    "many - body states , obtained from hf+bcs or hfb calculations , are used to construct a more general ground state . at present , this can be done in a consistent way using the same effective interaction .",
    "no systematic studies have been performed as yet .",
    "calculations starting from a solution in the collective variables , @xmath70 and @xmath94 and euler angles , @xmath207 , have been carried out with applications to the @xmath76 and @xmath290 shell closure by the group from bruyres - le - chtel @xcite .",
    "likewise , calculations starting from mean - field wave functions projected on angular momentum and particle number using skyrme interactions , have been carried out by the orsay - saclay - brussels groups @xcite .",
    "these calculations confirm specific extra binding energy contributions like the ones discussed in section [ sec - ibm - mixing ] .",
    "so , gcm calculations are becoming within reach for more extended studies in _ e.g. _  the pb region because such an approach accounts for the dynamics of the nuclear many - body problem . the shell - model , or , symmetry truncated ibm studies are formulated in the laboratory frame , conserving particle number and angular momentum from the beginning .",
    "in this sense , the two approaches , though starting from a different zero - order picture , essentially cover the same physics .",
    "the pb region has shown a number of most interesting features when moving into the neutron - deficient mass region . in the pb nuclei , low - lying @xmath1 excited states",
    "have been observed @xcite . in the po nuclei , at the lowest mass numbers reached at present ,",
    "clear indications exist for a very low - lying @xmath1 state that even might become the ground - state @xcite . in the hg and pt nuclei ,",
    "clear - cut evidence has accumulated for the presence of shape coexistence @xcite . in the hg nuclei ,",
    "the oblate shape is observed as being lowest in energy , even for the most neutron - deficient nuclei , whereas for the pt nuclei , a change from oblate into prolate shapes sets in around mass @xmath291 and the reverse path back from prolate into oblate around mass @xmath292 .",
    "similar results have been derived before and discussed @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of the present study to explore how well the mass dependence of the lowest energy minimum in a series of isotopes correlates with the variations in the binding energy ( using the two - neutron separation energies @xmath3 as indicator ) resulting from the recent high - resolution mass measurements .    on the scale of a @xmath3 plot ( mev energy scale )",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig - s2n - exp - isol ] ) , no details can be seen of the `` intruder '' correlations ( expected to be of the order of a few hundreds of kev ) .",
    "therefore , we split up a @xmath3 curve in two parts : a linear part and a part that contains local correlations ( deformation effects , specific mixing of configurations with the ground state ,  ) . in order to visualise deviations from a linear behavior of the @xmath3 values around neutron number , @xmath293 ( the mid - shell region ) , where nuclear shape coexistence and shape mixing is known to occur ,",
    "the linear curve was fitted to available experimental data outside of this range ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall concentrate on these differences @xmath294 ( and similarly in defining @xmath295 as the difference of the theoretical value with the linear fit ) . in all following figures ( unless stated explicitly ) , we use these reduced quantities . in fig .",
    "[ fig - s2np - tpe - over ] , we give an overview of the @xmath295 values , obtained for the pt , hg , pb and po nuclei . we shall give a more extensive discussion of these results in comparing them with the data in the various subsections .",

    "the @xmath298 values are given in fig .",
    "[ fig - s2np - pb ] .",
    "it is clear that down to the value at @xmath299 , only a moderate lowering is observed ( down to @xmath300 @xmath301 kev ) . beyond mid - shell neutron number ( @xmath302 ) , a rather important increase in @xmath298 results .",
    "the relative variation in this quantity , moving out of the closed shell at @xmath303 towards mid - shell and beyond , relative to the linear fit ( which is approximating the local liquid - drop variation very well ) is a reflection of the neutron shell - plus - pairing energy correction @xmath304 .",
    "these latter energy corrections causes the neutron closed shell at @xmath303 to become more strongly bound ( compared to a linear variation ) and the mid - shell region to become less strongly bound ( compared to the linear variation ) .",
    "the fact that for the pb nuclei , one has , at the same time , a closed proton shell at @xmath257 , makes these variations relatively small on an absolute scale and effects of deformation ( occurrence of oblate and/or prolate shapes ) can not easily be observed on the present energy scale used .",
    "the theoretical values @xmath295 , as plotted on the same figure [ fig - s2np - pb ] , are derived starting from a deformed woods - saxon in calculating the pes curves .",
    "the theoretical curve takes a large jump down approaching the neutron closed shell at @xmath303 and then remains moderately flat down to @xmath305 .",
    "then , a smooth but steady increase is observed in passing through the mid - shell region ( reflection of the behavior of @xmath306 ) . the theoretical increase , though , advances the experimental increase by a couple of mass units .",
    "it is clearly very interesting that masses for even lighter pb isotopes could be determined to test this behavior .",
    "the experimental reduced @xmath3 plots , @xmath309 , look rather similar ( see figures [ fig - s2np - hg ] for hg and [ fig - s2np - pt ] for pt isotopes ) . both show a systematic decrease in the separation energy for @xmath33 decreasing towards mid - shell at @xmath256 .",
    "the plot for hg shows a smooth valley with a minimum around @xmath310 kev .",
    "pt however , shows a sudden and steep minimum of @xmath311 kev for @xmath312pt@xmath313 .",
    "starting from mid - shell , the separation energies increase again for decreasing @xmath33",
    ".    one can check ( see @xcite for the specific energy spectra ) that around mid - shell @xmath256 two band structures are present .",
    "apart from the first one , known from heavy nuclei , that correspond to an oblate but weakly deformed structure , there appears another band that can be interpreted as a rotational spectrum corresponding with a prolate shape of larger deformation . in the hg nuclei , this second band only approaches the ground state to @xmath314 kev , whereas in the pt nuclei , the prolate structure becomes the ground - state band . as a conclusion ,",
    "the even - even @xmath315pt@xmath316 nuclei will have deformed ground states @xcite .    for the hg nuclei ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig - s2np - hg ] a comparison between the reduced pes calculations , resulting in the theoretical @xmath295 values and the corresponding experimental @xmath298 values .",
    "we observe a rather good overall agreement , except for the fact that in the theoretical curve a more pronounced flat region is obtained for neutron numbers in the interval @xmath317 , and the fact that below mid - shell , the theoretical values become slightly positive .",
    "the first region ( @xmath317 ) can be understood by the fact that the oblate minimum for these hg nuclei starts to develop , giving rise to a relative increase in the binding energy over a spherical liquid - drop behavior ( the linear reference line at zero ) .",
    "the oblate minimum deepens down to @xmath318 and then moves out again in the region @xmath319 , approaching the liquid - drop reference line ( see fig .",

    "the experimental and theoretical @xmath309 values are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - s2np - pt ] . concentrating on the theoretical curve",
    ", one can relate the general structure with the pes curves and their variation with decreasing neutron number . at first , around neutron number",
    "@xmath320 , the oblate minimum starts to develop , deepening in going from @xmath321 down to @xmath322 . at the same time , a prolate minimum takes shape and the minima for the oblate and prolate shape are almost degenerate at @xmath323 .",
    "the prolate minimum takes over and this minimum starts becoming less deep at neutron number @xmath324 . at @xmath325 , the prolate and oblate minima become degenerate again , but now as much less pronounced and deep minima ( see fig .  [ fig - s2np - pt - bis ] ) .",
    "this changing structure reflects the variation of the theoretical @xmath309 values , a structure that is also observed quite clearly in the experimental data .",
    "the po nuclei have recently been described using particle - core coupling and ibm studies @xcite and there , it has been discussed extensively that an intruder @xmath1 excited state is clearly dropping in energy with decreasing neutron number @xmath33 ( from @xmath322 down to @xmath327 ) and might even become the ground - state itself for these very neutron - deficient po nuclei .",
    "inspecting now the experimental @xmath298 values ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - s2np - po ] ) , it looks like the on - setting drop ( below the reference linear fit line ) from @xmath322 down to @xmath327 is strongly correlated with the above drop in energy of the intruder @xmath1 state .    in the results of the pes calculations",
    "( see also @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig - s2np - po - bis ] ) , the spherical minimum stays particularly stable down to @xmath322 but then an oblate minimum starts coming on and deepens systematically , relative to the spherical minimum . in this respect ,",
    "the comparison between the experimental and theoretical @xmath309 values goes rather well , down to @xmath322 , in view of the energy scale used on the fig .",
    "[ fig - s2np - po ] . at neutron number @xmath322 ,",
    "the theoretical and experimental curves are going opposite ways .",
    "for the theoretical results , below @xmath322 down to @xmath327 , the oblate minimum is developing relative to the spherical minimum with a prolate minimum quickly entering the picture that already is the lowest one ( compared to the oblate minimum and the spherical point ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig - s2np - po - bis ] .",
    "the difference with the hg and pt nuclei is , that in those cases ( below @xmath257 ) , very quickly , the oblate and prolate minima appear much below the energy corresponding with the spherical point . in po , on the contrary ,",
    "this is not the case .",
    "potential minima develop at oblate and prolate shapes , but the spherical point dominates down to @xmath324 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - s2np - po - bis ] ) .",
    "it is this difference that causes the theoretical @xmath328 curve to move up ( relative to the linear fit ) .",
    "the clear differences then point out either , that the pes situation in the po nuclei is not so well reproduced , or , that dynamical effects , originating from mixing between the wave functions , localised at the various collective minima and the spherical point , play an important role . the latter effect",
    ", which is absent in any of the comparisons made in this section ( the pb , hg , pt and po nuclei ) implies that in the present comparison we can not expect detailed agreement : only a qualitative correlation between trends in the theoretical and experimental @xmath309 can be expected .",
    "of course , the measurement of masses in the even more neutron - deficient nuclei is extremely important .",
    "one might get access to the study of effects of ( i ) collective ( deformation versus spherical shape ) correlations and ( ii ) specific local configuration mixing inducing extra binding energy in the nuclear ground - state configurations .",
    "as a conclusion to section [ sec - intru ] , we can say that mixing between intruder and regular states has an influence on both nuclear energy spectra and nuclear binding energies .",
    "however , we are still far from a detailed description of the consequences of mixing on the separation energies , as has become clear from the previous plots ( see figures [ fig - s2np - pb],[fig - s2np - hg ] , [ fig - s2np - pt ] , and [ fig - s2np - po ] ) .",
    "even though the many parameters appearing in the macroscopic - microscopic model to evaluate nuclear masses and pes , those parameters are fitted to an enormous mount of data in a complex fitting procedure ; they remain untouched after that",
    ". only a few of them ( see also section [ sec - ldm - vall ] ) are really fitted to all masses ; the other ones are fitted to selected data sets .",
    "therefore , the masses derived this way ( and derived @xmath3 values ) can not be used to account for all localised nuclear structure correlations ( at and near closed shells , the precise onset of regions of deformation ) , which is also not the aim of the many mass studies @xcite .",
    "only after including dynamical effects ( like _ e.g. _  the gcm approach ) can one expect to cover both , the full global and local mass behavior .",
    "it should be stressed that in the case of the ibm calculations , the parameters of the local hamiltonian have been chosen independently from the `` @xmath3 problem '' .",
    "they were obtained from an independent fit of the energy spectra in this mass region for both , the regular and intruder states .",
    "as far as the two - neutron separation energies are concerned , the ibm results can count as a prediction for the actual @xmath309 values .",
    "in the present paper , in which we have studied nuclear binding energies and their global properties over a large region of the nuclear mass table , we also concentrated on local deviations from a smooth behavior and made use of the two - neutron separation energy , @xmath3 , as an important property to explore the nuclear mass surface .",
    "the latter local variations could stem from the presence of shell or sub - shell closure , the appearance of a localised region of deformation or might originate in specific configuration mixing with the ground state that causes local increased binding energies to show up .",
    "the very recent high - resolution measurements that have been carried out , in particular at the isoltrap and mistral set - ups at isolde / cern have allowed to study nuclear masses with an unprecedented precision of @xmath329 and as such brings the interest of mass measurements from tests of global mass formulae or hf(b ) studies into a realm that allows tests of shell - model calculations .    here , we have discussed up to what level calculations - making use of global macroscopic models , macroscopic - microscopic calculations , the shell - model and the interacting boson model - can give a correct overall description of the nuclear mass surface ( along the region of the valley of stability as well as for series of isotopes ) .",
    "it has become clear that , if one starts from a simple liquid - drop approach , the observed almost linear drop in the @xmath3 value is accounted essentially through the asymmetry term .",
    "this term causes nuclei to become less bound when moving out of the region where @xmath330 in a systematic way and even turns to a linear variation in ( [ ldm - a ] ) when the neutron excess is becoming really large .",
    "the liquid drop approach is able to give the correct overall mass dependence in @xmath3 along the stability line as well as for long series of isotopes .",
    "it is observed though that the experimental slope is somewhat less pronounced compared to the liquid drop behavior ( see fig .  [ fig - ldm - contrib ] ) , but here , more sophisticated macroscopic - microscopic calculations have resulted into impressive results",
    ".    the above features also result from a shell - model approach in which we treat a given mass region approximately starting from a reference ( doubly)-closed shell nucleus and have the valence nucleons filling a single-@xmath53 shell model orbital .",
    "using a zero - range @xmath54 interaction , a linear variation with the number of nucleons , @xmath61 , in describing the binding energy @xmath331 results . for more general interactions , still keeping seniority , @xmath55 , as a good quantum number , a linear plus quadratic @xmath61 dependence is obtained with the coefficient of the quadratic part contributing with a repulsive component to the total binding energy of the shell .",
    "this term is similar in nature and relative magnitude to the asymmetry term of the liquid - drop model description .",
    "finally , a linear drop in the value of @xmath3 results .",
    "there is a clear need to do better and try more detailed shell - model calculations . at present , the limitations of standard large - scale diagonalization constrain the calculations to the @xmath332 shell .",
    "recent , new developments , starting from diagonalizations in a basis generated from monte - carlo sampling of the essential nuclear degrees of freedom ( monte - carlo shell model diagonalization : mcsmd ) have resulted in highly encouraging results that may open new possibilities to cover both , global and local nuclear properties in a consistent and unified way @xcite ) .",
    "there are remaining problems connected with deriving absolute binding energies since one needs a good description for the variation with @xmath12 or @xmath33 of the single - particle energies @xmath51 .",
    "some prescriptions are in use @xcite , but there remains a difficulty for pure shell - model studies .    in plotting the value of @xmath3 versus the number of nucleon pairs , the shape is close to linear .",
    "deviations , however , show up that must be due to the subsequent filling of a number of single - particle orbitals and to the correlation energy that results from the interactions in which pairing and proton - neutron forces play a major role . a pair approximation , as used within the interacting boson model , can then be used to take into account both the global and local components of nuclear binding energy .",
    "we have discussed a procedure which starts from simultaneous treating binding energies and excitation energies in extracting parameters for the linear and quadratic @xmath104 casimir invariant operators .",
    "this approach bases on the assumption that the added global part to the ibm result is the same for a chain of isotopes .",
    "it should be stressed that the linear part will change when changing between major shells and even when crossing the mid - shell region .",
    "this latter fact turns out to be an intrinsic deficiency of the ibm due to the fact that the pauli principle is included only in an approximate way ( there is no reference any more to the subsequent filling of a set of single - particle orbitals with a maximal number of nucleons ) . in section [ sec - calc - ab ] , we have reported a detailed prescription in order to obtain a consistent description of binding energies , energy spectra and transition rates in the framework of the ibm .    in a second part of the paper ,",
    "we have concentrated particularly on local deviations from the above global description .",
    "the possibility to study nuclear masses with the highest possible precision has become available over the last years , in particular at the isoltrap and mistral set - ups at isolde / cern . here , precisions of the order of @xmath333 kev on a total mass of a heavy pb nuclei ( @xmath334 @xmath335 mev ) is reached .",
    "this has given rise to a number of unexpected features in the masses of neutron - deficient nuclei in the region of pt , hg , pb , po , rn , ra @xcite . before",
    ", similar local deviations had been observed in the region of light @xmath76 nuclei for na , mg @xcite .    in the present paper , we have pointed out the necessity to incorporate configuration mixing of the regular ground state with low - lying @xmath1 intruder states that approach the @xmath1 ground - state in the neutron mid - shell region ( @xmath336 ) for nuclei near closed - shell configurations .",
    "we have carried out detailed calculations for the po nuclei .",
    "similar calculations for the whole pb region will be carried out elsewhere in a consistent way . at the same time , calculations for the potential energy surfaces(pes ) of the given nuclei in the pb region have been performed , using the macroscopic - microscopic model with the universal deformed woods - saxon parametrisation . here ,",
    "the various shapes : spherical configuration , oblate and prolate deformed shapes and their relative ordering , as a function of neutron number , is instrumental in understanding local ground - state energy deviations from the background liquid - drop behavior . we observe a good correlation between the experimental values of @xmath309 and the calculated ones on the @xmath337 kev - scale .",
    "these results are encouraging in the light of lack of dynamical effects : we just compare energy minima for different shapes without taking into account mixing that will inevitably occur between such close - lying states .    resuming , we have shown , in a first part , that both , a liquid - drop approach ( macroscopic - microscopic models in general ) as well as the shell model and the ibm describe the global part of the @xmath3 value essentially identical .",
    "the linear drop is mainly connected to the asymmetry term ( in the ldm ) , the quadratic terms ( in the shell model ) and the quadratic @xmath104 casimir invariant ( in the ibm ) , but all three contain the same physics .",
    "both , the overall drop in @xmath3 for the whole mass region , as well as in specific long isotopic series are well accounted for .",
    "the experimental drop is overall less steep . in particular , in the case of the ibm we have shown that it is possible to give a consistent description of ground - state and excited - state properties .",
    "this description is able to reproduce the experimental @xmath3 values rather well .",
    "finally , in a third part , deviations in nuclear binding from the global trend are showing up in various localised regions . in the pb region , it is most probably the effect of mixing of low - lying intruder configurations ( oblate and/or prolate shape configurations ) into the ground - state that turns out to be responsible for increased binding energies in the neutron - deficient region .",
    "using configuration mixing in the ibm , detailed studies can be carried out and a consistent study is planned for the pb region and for other ( sub)shell - closures . the pes study of static properties on the other hand is able to give a good guidance to the interpretation of the specific deviations that have been observed in the pb region .",
    "thus nuclear mass measurements are becoming increasingly important since they have progressed now to the level of testing microscopic studies ( shell - model effects , localised zones of nuclear deformation ,  ) .",
    "this will become clearly an important line of research in future projects .",

    "<S> nuclear binding energies and two - neutron separation energies are analysed starting from the liquid - drop model and the nuclear shell model in order to describe the global trends of the above observables . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently concentrate on the interacting boson model ( ibm ) and discuss a new method in order to provide a consistent description of both , ground - state and excited - state properties . </S>",
    "<S> we address the artefacts that appear when crossing mid - shell using the ibm formulation and perform detailed numerical calculations for nuclei situated in the @xmath0 shell . </S>",
    "<S> we also concentrate on local deviations from the above global trends in binding energy and two - neutron separation energies that appear in the neutron - deficient pb region . </S>",
    "<S> we address possible effects on the binding energy , caused by mixing of low - lying @xmath1 intruder states into the ground state , using configuration mixing in the ibm framework . </S>",
    "<S> we also study ground - state properties using a macroscopic - microscopic model . </S>",
    "<S> detailed comparisons with recent experimental data in the pb region are amply discussed .     * </S>",
