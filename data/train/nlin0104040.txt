    "such situations occur in many experimental settings . in an experiment on a vertically vibrating granular monolayer of spheres @xcite",

    "@xcite ) . in common with other generic models , like the complex ginzburg - landau equation or the swift - hohenberg equation ,",
    "ccm models are meant to incorporate the minimal basic properties capable of reproducing the phenomena of interest . with this in mind we construct our ccm model to incorporate the essential feature that both a stable steady homogeneous attractor and a spatio - temporally chaotic attractor exist . using our ccm model , we numerically investigate two phenomena : ( i ) the coarsening of the front due to the inherent ` noise ' associated with the spatio - temporal chaos ( sec .",
    "iii ) , and ( ii ) cusp formation induced by initial long wavelength perturbations of the front location from the flat state ( sec .",
    "iv ) .    with respect to ( i ) , an important concept used to study various coarsening processes is scaling . for a large number of systems ( e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) , it is found that the interface width due to roughening , @xmath0 , increases as a power of time , @xmath1 .",
    "the width eventually saturates at a value that increases as a power of the system size , @xmath2 .",
    "these scaling properties are also observed in our model , and we determine and discuss the scaling exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 that we find .    with respect to ( ii ) , we argue that on long scale ( i.e. , long compared to @xmath5 ) , our fronts propagate at constant speed in a direction locally normal to the interface .",
    "we show that this basic property explains the mechanism of cusp formation and the evolution of the shape of the fronts observed in our numerical simulations .",
    "as in reference @xcite , we consider a ccm model which maps a field @xmath6 forward from time @xmath7 to time @xmath8 .",
    "with reference to a system driven periodically in time ( e.g. , as in @xcite ) , we may think of @xmath9 , with @xmath10 as being the system state stroboscopically sampled once each period .",
    "furthermore , we consider @xmath11 to be two - dimensional , and , for simplicity , we take @xmath12 to be a scalar field .",
    "the ccm model mapping @xmath12 to @xmath13 consists of two steps : the first step is a nonlinear local operation in which a one - dimensional map @xmath14 is applied to @xmath15 at each point in space , @xmath16 the second step is a translationally invariant linear operation coupling the dynamics at nearby spatial locations .",
    "the most general such coupling is conveniently expressed in terms of the spatial fourier transform .",
    "if @xmath17 is the spatial fourier transform of @xmath6 , then we write @xmath18 as @xmath19 from which @xmath20 is obtained by inverse fourier transforming .    the model",
    "is then specified by the choice of the nonlinear map @xmath21 and the linear spatial coupling @xmath22 .",
    "we make these choices so as to include the minimum properties that we hypothesize are relevant for the investigated phenomena @xcite .",
    "since we desire the simultaneous existence of a stable steady state as well as a spatio - temporally chaotic state , we choose the map @xmath21 to have a stable fixed point attractor and a chaotic attractor . a convenient choice having this property is given by @xmath23 - a { \\rm exp}(-1/\\sigma^2 ) .",

    "[ fig : map ] , we see that this map has a stable fixed point at @xmath24 , for @xmath25 .",

    "we also see from fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] that the interval @xmath27 is mapped into itself .",

    "there is one attractor in @xmath31 and it is chaotic .",

    "\\label{eq : couple2}\\ ] ] thus @xmath40 ( growth ) for @xmath41 , @xmath37 has its maximum value at @xmath42 , and @xmath37 becomes strongly negative ( damping ) as @xmath43 becomes large .",
    "our numerical implementation of this ccm model employs doubly periodic boundary conditions with periodicity lengths @xmath44 in @xmath45 and @xmath46 in @xmath47 .",
    "the nonlinear map operator is applied at points on a square grid , while the spatial coupling operator ( [ eq : couple1 ] ) employs fast fourier transforming from @xmath48 to @xmath49 and back .",
    "that @xmath50 is an attractor can be seen by introducing an initial perturbation at wavenumber @xmath51exp@xmath52 .",
    "linearization of the ccm model about @xmath53 then shows that this perturbation evolves with time to @xmath54exp@xmath52 , where @xmath55^n , m'(\\xi ) \\equiv \\partial m / \\partial \\xi$ ] . for the parameters we choose @xmath56 for all @xmath43 ( in particular @xmath57 ) .",
    "thus the homogeneous state @xmath50 is an attractor for the system .",
    "we also find that , as we had anticipated , for other initial conditions there is another attractor which is spatio - temporally chaotic .",

    "[ fig : stchaos1](b ) .",
    "we note that the only length scales in our model are @xmath63 , the system size @xmath64 , and the grid size @xmath65 , and that , by our choice @xmath66 , we had sought to obtain spatio - temporal chaos with properties independent of @xmath67 and @xmath65 .",

    "[ fig : stchaos1](c ) the time correlation function decays to zero with increasing time @xmath76 ( where @xmath76 is an integer ) , confirming that the temporal behavior is chaotic .",
    "we have also examined other parameter values for which ( [ eq : map1])-([eq : couple2 ] ) yields spatio - temporal chaos , and we find behavior similar to that in figs . [",
    "fig : stchaos1 ] .",
    "the main objective of our investigation is to characterize the dynamics of the interface between a spatio - temporally chaotic state and a stable steady state . in our first set of simulations we focus on an initially flat interface , @xmath77 at @xmath78 . after we generate an initial spatio - temporally chaotic state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stchaos1](a ) ) , we create the interface by setting the amplitude @xmath79 of all grid points with @xmath80 to the stable steady state value @xmath24 . during further iterations , the front between the chaotic and steady state moves downward , i.e. , the chaotic state propagates into the stable steady state , and the front coarsens ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flat1 ] ) . in order to examine the front dynamics for long times and save computational time",
    ", we use a shifting method : on every iterate , we reset @xmath79 to zero in the region adjacent to the bottom ( @xmath81 ) of the periodic box , and , when the front comes close to @xmath82 , we shift the whole system upward in the _ y direction . due to the periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "after this shift there will be a region below the front and above @xmath81 that is in the spatio - temporally chaotic regime , and we then set @xmath83 in this region . _    after an initial transient , the scaling properties of the front are studied using the following definition of the interface width .",
    "first , we calculated the average value of @xmath79 at fixed @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "we then note that the basin boundary between the two attractors of the one dimensional map @xmath21 is at the unstable fixed point , @xmath86 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ) , and that the average @xmath79 for the spatio - temporally chaotic state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stchaos1](a ) ) is approximately four times the critical value .",
    "thus , we define a lower boundary of the front , @xmath87 , by @xmath88 and an upper boundary of the front , @xmath89 , by @xmath90 . the width of the front is then defined as @xmath91 .    because of the inherent ` noise ' generated in the spatio - temporally chaotic region , the proper quantity to study is the ensemble averaged mean of the front widths .",
    "we calculate ensembles using many different random initial conditions .",
    "our results for the ensemble averaged width @xmath29 of the front are obtained by averaging ( @xmath92 ) over 10 runs for the largest system @xmath93 and over 500 runs for the smallest @xmath94 .",
    "the typical coarsening of the front is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flat1 ] .",
    "one observation from our simulations is that the propagation velocity of fronts is constant , except for a few transient initial iterations .",
    "that is , the velocity does not depend on time or system size .",
    "a constant propagation front velocity is also observed in the experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . to minimize the effect of the initial transient , we redefine time as the total increase in the area of the chaotic state .    as is typical for a front coarsening problem @xcite , the time and system size dependence of the mean front width @xmath95 can be described by a scaling function @xmath96 , @xmath97 here @xmath98 is constant for @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 . for @xmath102 ,",
    "the width saturates at @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the roughness exponent .",

    "[ fig : kpz](a ) , we show @xmath29 versus @xmath106 for different system sizes .",
    "these data show two characteristic regimes : power law growth , followed by saturation .",
    "the growth exponent , @xmath107 , is calculated by measuring the slopes of straight line fits to the data before saturation , and the roughness exponents @xmath108 is calculated by comparing the saturation widths .",
    "figure [ fig : kpz](b ) shows @xmath109 versus @xmath110 , where @xmath3 and @xmath105 have been adjusted to @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( corresponding to @xmath113 ) .",
    "consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfunction ] ) , we find collapse of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : kpz](a ) to a single scaling function .",
    "the exponent values we obtain are roughly consistent with those of both the two dimensional eden model ( @xmath114 ) and the two dimensional kardar - parisi - zhang equation ( @xmath115 ) @xcite .",
    "we now consider the evolution of a front on large length scale .",
    "specifically , we are interested in the case where the front is initially not flat ; that is , the position of the front is initially given by @xmath116 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that , as the front evolves , the scale on which the front position varies , @xmath117 , remains large compared to the front width , @xmath118    to analyze this situation , we consider that a point on the front moves with a normal velocity @xmath119 whose magnitude , @xmath120 , is constant in time .",
    "this assumption also implies that the direction of @xmath119 following the trajectory of a point on the front is constant in time .",
    "this is because the slope of the front , @xmath121 , following a trajectory does not change with time ; i.e. , it depends only on the initial location @xmath122 on the front and not on @xmath106 .",
    "this is illustrated by the construction in fig .",
    "[ fig : cusp1](a ) . as shown in the figure , the trajectory line segments are straight , are all of the same length , @xmath123 , and are normal to both the initial front and to the evolved front . considering an initial front position given by @xmath116 , propagation at a velocity @xmath119 normal to the front then yields @xmath124^{-1/2 } , \\\\",

    "an example consider the case of an initial sinusoidal undulation of the front @xmath125 .",
    "as the front propagates , the initial sinusoidal curve becomes distorted so that the maxima become sharp and the minima become broad . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : cusp1 ] ( a ) this arises because of the converging ( diverging ) of trajectories that originate near maxima ( minima ) .",
    "past a critical time @xmath126 a cusp develops at the maxima of the evolved front @xcite .",

    "the two cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cusp2 ] ( namely , @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) illustrate how front roughening becomes of less influence as ( [ eq : nonflat ] ) becomes better satisfied .",
