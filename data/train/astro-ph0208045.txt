    "2001 ) , both may support the idea that massive stars in galactic and subgalactic systems  rather than quasars  reionized the hydrogen component of the igm when the universe was less than 5% of its current age , and dominate the 1 ryd metagalactic flux at all redshifts greater than 3 .",
    "an episode of pregalactic star formation may also provide a possible explanation for the widespread existence of heavy elements ( like carbon , oxygen , and silicon ) in the igm .",
    "there is mounting evidence that the double reionization of helium may have occurred later , at a redshift of 3 or so ( see kriss et al .",

    "establishing what ended the dark ages and when is important for determining the impact of cosmological reionization and reheating on several key cosmological issues , from the role reionization plays in allowing protogalactic objects to cool and make stars , to determining the thermal state of baryons at high redshifts and the small  scale structure in the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "conversely , probing the reionization epoch may provide a means for constraining competing models for the formation of cosmic structures : for example , popular modifications of the cdm paradigm that attempt to improve over cdm by suppressing the primordial power  spectrum on small scales , like warm dark matter ( wdm ) , are known to reduce the number of collapsed halos at high redshifts and make it more difficult to reionize the universe ( barkana et  al .",
    "2001 ) . in this talk",
    "i will summarize some recent theoretical developments in understanding the astrophysics of the epoch of first light and the impact that some of the earliest generations of stars , galaxies , and black holes in the universe may have had on the igm .",
    "in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe , structure formation is a hierarchical process in which non linear , massive structures grow via the merger of smaller initial units .",
    "large numbers of low ",
    "mass galaxy halos are expected to form at early times in these popular theories , leading to an era of reionization , reheating , and chemical enrichment .",
    "most models predict that intergalactic hydrogen was reionized by an early generation of stars or accreting black holes at @xmath8 .",
    "one should note , however , that while numerical n ",
    "body@xmath9hydrodynamical simulations have convincingly shown that the igm does fragment into structures at early times in cdm cosmogonies ( e.g. cen et  al .",
    "1994 ; zhang et  al .  1995 ; hernquist et  al .",
    "1996 ) , the same simulations are much less able to predict the efficiency with which the first gravitationally collapsed objects lit up the universe at the end of the dark age .    the scenario that has received the most theoretical studies is one where hydrogen is photoionized by the uv radiation emitted either by quasars or by stars with masses @xmath10 ( e.g. shapiro & giroux 1987 ; haiman & loeb 1998 ; madau et  al .  1999 ;",
    "chiu & ostriker 2000 ; ciardi et  al .",
    "2000 ) , rather than ionized by collisions with electrons heated up by , e.g. supernova  driven winds from early pregalactic objects . in the former case",
    "a high degree of ionization requires about @xmath11ev per hydrogen atom , where @xmath12 is the volume  averaged hydrogen recombination timescale , @xmath13 being much greater than unity already at @xmath14 according to numerical simulations .",
    "collisional ionization to a neutral fraction of only a few parts in @xmath15 requires a comparable energy input , i. e. an igm temperature close to @xmath16k or about @xmath17ev per atom .",
    "massive stars will deposit both radiative and mechanical energy into the interstellar medium of protogalaxies .",
    "a complex network of ` feedback ' mechanisms is likely at work in these systems , as the gas in shallow potential is more easily blown away ( dekel & silk 1986 ; tegmark et  al .",
    "1993 ; mac low & ferrara 1999 ; mori et al .",
    "2002 ) thereby quenching star formation . furthermore",
    ", as the blastwaves produced by supernova explosions reheat the surrounding intergalactic gas and enrich it with newly formed heavy elements ( see below ) , they can inhibit the formation of surrounding low  mass galaxies due to ` baryonic stripping ' ( scannapieco et  al .",
    "it is therefore difficult to establish whether an early input of mechanical energy will actually play a major role in determining the thermal and ionization state of the igm on large scales .",
    "what can be easily shown is that , during the evolution of a a ` typical ' stellar population , more energy is lost in ultraviolet radiation than in mechanical form .",
    "this is because in nuclear burning from zero to solar metallicity ( @xmath18 ) , the energy radiated per baryon is @xmath19 , with about one third of it going into h  ionizing photons .",
    "the same massive stars that dominate the uv light also explode as supernovae ( sne ) , returning most of the metals to the interstellar medium and injecting about @xmath20ergs per event in kinetic energy . for a salpeter initial mass function ( imf )",
    ", one has about one sn every @xmath21 of baryons that forms stars .",
    "the mass fraction in mechanical energy is then approximately @xmath22 , ten times lower than the fraction released in photons above 1 ryd .    the relative importance of photoionization versus shock ionization will depend , however , on the efficiency with which radiation and mechanical energy actually escape into the igm .",
    "consider , for example , the case of an early generation of subgalactic systems collapsing at redshift 9 from 2@xmath23 fluctuations .",
    "at these epochs their dark matter halos would have virial radii @xmath24 kpc and circular velocities @xmath25 , corresponding in top ",
    "hat spherical collapse to a virial temperature @xmath26k and halo mass @xmath27 .. ]   halos in this mass range are characterized by very short dynamical timescales ( and even shorter gas cooling times due to atomic hydrogen ) and may therefore form stars in a rapid but intense burst before sn ` feedback ' quenches further star formation . for a star formation efficiency of @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the baryon density parameter , and @xmath30 is the fraction of halo mass converted into stars . ] , @xmath31 , and a salpeter imf , the explosive output of @xmath32 sne will inject an energy @xmath33ergs .",
    "this is roughly a hundred times higher than the gas binding energy : a significant fraction of the halo gas will then be lifted out of the potential well ( ` blow  away ' ) and shock the intergalactic medium ( madau et  al .",
    "if the explosion occurs at cosmic time @xmath34yr ( corresponding in the adopted cosmology to @xmath35 ) , at time @xmath36 after the event it is a good approximation to treat the cosmological blast wave as adiabatic , with proper radius given by the standard sedov  taylor self ",
    "similar solution , @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the fraction of the available sn energy that is converted into kinetic energy of the blown  away material ( mori et  al .  2002 ) . at this instant",
    "the shock velocity relative to the hubble flow is @xmath39 lower than the escape velocity from the halo center .",
    "the gas temperature just behind the shock front is @xmath40k , enough to ionize all incoming intergalactic hydrogen . at these redshifts , it is the onset of compton cooling off cosmic microwave background photons that ends the adiabatic stage of blast wave propagation ; the shell then enters the snowplough phase and is finally confined by the igm pressure . according to the press ",
    "schechter formalism , the comoving abundance of collapsed dark halos with mass @xmath41 at @xmath35 is @xmath42mpc@xmath43 , corresponding to a mean proper distance between neighboring halos of @xmath44kpc . with the assumed star formation efficiency , only a small fraction , about 4 percent , of the total stellar mass inferred today ( fukugita et  al .",
    "1998 ) would actually form at these early epochs .",
    "still , our simple analysis shows that the blast waves from such a population of pregalactic objects could drive vast portions of the igm to a significantly higher adiabat , @xmath45k , than expected from photoionization , so as to ` choke off ' the collapse of further @xmath46 systems by raising the cosmological jeans mass . in this sense",
    "the process may be self  regulating .",
    "the thermal history of expanding intergalactic primordial gas at the mean density is plotted in figure 1 as a function of redshift for a number of illustrative cases .",
    "the code we have used includes the relevant cooling and heating processes and follows the non  equilibrium evolution of hydrogen and helium ionic species in a cosmological context .",
    "the gas is allowed to interact with the cmb through compton cooling and either with a time  dependent qso ionizing background as computed by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) or with a time  independent metagalactic flux of intensity @xmath47 at 1 ryd ( and power  law spectrum with energy slope @xmath48 ) .",

    "consistently from photoheating or fixed to be in the range @xmath49k expected from sn  driven bubbles with significant filling factors ( see below ) .",
    "the various curves show that the temperature of the igm at @xmath50 will retain little memory of an early era of pregalactic outflows and preheating , and be consistent with that expected from photoionization .",
    "understanding the origin of the chemical elements , following the increase in their abundances with cosmic time , and uncovering the processes responsible for distributing the products of stellar nucleosynthesis over very large distances are all key aspects of the evolution of gaseous matter in the universe .",
    "one of the major discoveries with _ keck _ concerning the igm has been the identification of metal absorption lines associated with many of the ly@xmath3forest systems .",

    "there is no indication in the data of a turnover in the column density distribution down to @xmath55 ( @xmath56 , ellison et  al .",
    "2000 ) .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", it is unclear whether the existence of heavy elements in the igm at @xmath57 points to an early ( @xmath58 ) enrichment epoch by low  mass subgalactic systems ( madau et  al .",
    "2001 ) , or is rather due to late pollution by the population of star  forming galaxies known to be already in place at @xmath59 . the press  schechter theory for the evolving mass function of dark matter halos predicts a power ",
    "law dependence , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the effective slope of the cdm power spectrum , @xmath62 on subgalactic scales .",
    "as hot , metal  enriched gas from sn  driven winds escapes its host halo , shocks the igm , and eventually forms a blast wave , it sweeps a region of intergalactic space the volume of which increases with the @xmath63 power of the injected energy @xmath64 ( in the adiabatic sedov  taylor phase ) . the total fractional volume or",
    "porosity , @xmath65 , filled by these ` metal bubbles ' per unit explosive energy density @xmath66 is then @xmath67 . within this simple scenario",
    "it is the star  forming objects with the smallest masses which will arguably be the most efficient pollutant of the igm on large scales .",
    "metal  enriched material from sn ejecta may be far more easily accelerated to escape velocities in the shallow potential wells of subgalactic systems at @xmath58 .",
    "late enrichment may also encounter problems in explaining the kinematic quiescence of lines ; the observed small scale properties of the igm at @xmath54 appear consistent with absorbers being the result of ancient pregalactic outflows ( rauch et  al .",
    "according to numerical hydrodynamics simulations of structure formation in the igm , the metals associated with @xmath68 filaments fill a fraction @xmath69 of intergalactic space , and are therefore far away from the high overdensity peaks where galaxies form , gas cools , and star formation takes place .",
    "their chemical enrichment may then reflect more uniform ( i.e. ` early ' ) rather than in ",
    "situ ( i.e. ` late ' ) metal pollution . the case for pregalactic enrichment may have been recently strenghtened by the observation of an invariant column density distribution throughout the redshift range @xmath70 ( songaila 2001 ) .    to simulate the process of blow ",
    "away we have developed a 3d eulerian code that solves the hydrodynamic equations for a perfect fluid in cartesian geometry . to deal with very different length scales in our simulation",
    "we have adopted a ` nested grid method ' with six levels of fixed cartesian grids .",
    "the grids are connected by the transfer of conserved variables , and are centered within each other , with the finest covering the whole galaxy halo . since the cell number is the same ( @xmath71 ) for every level l@xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , the minimum resolved scale is about 22 pc and the size of the coarsest grid is 96 kpc .",
    "thus , the scheme has a wide dynamic range in the space dimension .",
    "the results of a numerical simulation ( run on massive parallel supercomputers at the center for computational physics , tsukuba university ) are depicted in figure 2 . in this run",
    "about 10,000 sne explode in a high redshift protohalo ( corresponding to a star formation efficiency of about 10% for a salpeter imf ) .",
    "our algorithm for simulating sn feedback improves upon previous treatments in several ways .",
    "ob associations are distributed as a function of gas density according to a schmidt  type law ( @xmath74 ) using a monte  carlo procedure . after a main sequence lifetime ,",
    "all stars more massive than 8 m@xmath75 explode instantaneously injecting an energy of @xmath76 ergs , and their outer layers are blown out leaving a compact remnant of 1.4 m@xmath75 . therefore sne inject energy ( assumed in pure thermal form ) and mass into the interstellar medium : these are supplied to a sphere corresponding to the radius of a sn remnant in a uniform ambient medium of density @xmath72 and in the adiabatic sedov",
    " taylor phase ; the expansion velocity is also self  consistently calculated from such solution .",
    "the gas then starts cooling immediately according to the adopted gas cooling function . while the time  step @xmath77 is controlled by the courant condition , if there are more than two sn events in a ob association we decrease @xmath77 until only one explosion per association occurs during the time  step .",
    "snapshots of the gas density distribution in a planar slice of the nested grids are shown for an extended stellar distribution case ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "after a few myr from the beginning of the simulation the most massive stars explode as sne and produce expanding hot bubbles surrounded by a cooling dense ( @xmath78  cm@xmath43 ) shell . as the evolution continues ,",
    "a coherent and increasingly spherical shell expanding into the igm is eventually formed .",
    "the shell contains a large fraction of the halo gas that has been swept  up during the evolution .",
    "the final bottom row of the simulation figure shows the final stages of the evolution : the shell is now nearly spherically symmetric , its interior being filled with warm ( @xmath80  k ) gas at a very low density @xmath81  cm@xmath43 , i.e. slightly below the mean value for the igm . at the end of the simulations",
    ", the shell is still sweeping out igm material ; its radius and velocity are 21 kpc and 26 km sec@xmath82 at @xmath83myr . using momentum conservation",
    "one can estimate the final radius of the shell to be close to 25 kpc .",
    "this is about 17 times the virial radius of the halo !    it is clear then that sn ",
    "driven pregalactic outflows may be an efficient mechanism for spreading metals around .",
    "the collective explosive output of about ten thousands sne per @xmath84 halo at these early epochs could then pollute the entire intergalactic space to a mean metallicity @xmath85 ( comparable to the levels observed in the forest at @xmath86 ) without much perturbing the igm hydrodynamically , i.e. producing large variations of the baryons relative to the dark matter .",
    "the significance of these results goes well beyond early metal enrichment .",
    "this is because , since the cooling time of collisionally ionized high density gas in small halos at high redshifts is much shorter than the then hubble time , virtually all baryons are predicted to sink to the centers of these halos in the absence of any countervailing effect ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "efficient feedback is then necessary in hierarchical clustering scenarios to avoid this ` cooling catastrophe ' , i.e. to prevent too many baryons from turning into stars as soon as the first levels of the hierarchy collapse .",
    "the required reduction of the stellar birthrate in halos with low circular velocities may naturally result from the heating and expulsion of material due to ob stellar winds and repeated sn explosions from the first burst of star formation .",
    "prior to the epoch of full reionization , the intergalactic medium and gravitationally collapsed systems may be detectable in emission or absorption against the cmb at the frequency corresponding to the redshifted 21cm line ( associated with the spin  flip transition from the triplet to the singlet state of neutral hydrogen . ) in general , 21cm spectral features are expected to display angular structure as well as structure in redshift space due to inhomogeneities in the gas density field , hydrogen ionized fraction , and spin temperature .",
    "several different signatures have been investigated in the recent literature : ( a ) the fluctuations in the redshifted 21cm emission induced by the gas density inhomogeneities that develop at early times in cdm - dominated cosmologies ( madau et  al .",
    "1997 ; tozzi et  al .",
    "2000 ) and by virialized `` minihalos '' with @xmath87k ( iliev 2002 ) ; ( b ) the sharp absorption feature in the radio sky due to the rapid rise of the ly@xmath3continuum background that marks the birth of the first uv sources in the universe ( shaver et  al .  1999 ) ; ( c ) the 21cm narrow lines generated in absorption against very high  redshift radio sources by the neutral igm ( carilli et  al .",
    "2002 ) and by intervening minihalos and protogalactic disks ( furlanetto & loeb 2002 ) .",
    "a quick summary of the physics of 21cm radiation will illustrate the basic ideas and unresolved issues behind these studies .",
    "the emission or absorption of 21cm photons from a neutral igm is governed by the hydrogen spin temperature @xmath88 defined by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the singlet and triplet @xmath92 hyperfine levels and @xmath93ev is the energy of the 21cm transition . in the presence of only the cmb radiation with @xmath94k , the spin states will reach thermal equilibrium with the cmb on a timescale of @xmath95yr ( @xmath96s@xmath82 is the spontaneous decay rate of the hyperfine transition of atomic hydrogen ) , and intergalactic will produce neither an absorption nor an emission signature .",
    "a mechanism is required that decouples @xmath88 and @xmath97 , e.g. by coupling the spin temperature instead to the kinetic temperature @xmath98 of the gas itself .",
    "two mechanisms are available , collisions between hydrogen atoms ( purcell & field 1956 ) and scattering by ly@xmath3photons ( field 1958 ) .",
    "the collision  induced coupling between the spin and kinetic temperatures is dominated by the spin ",
    "exchange process between the colliding hydrogen atoms .",
    "the rate , however , is too small for realistic igm densities at the redshifts of interest , although collisions may be important in dense regions with @xmath99^{-2}$ ] , like virialized minihalos .    in the low density igm ,",
    "the dominant mechanism is the scattering of continuum uv photons redshifted by the hubble expansion into local ly@xmath3photons .",
    "the many scatterings mix the hyperfine levels of neutral hydrogen in its ground state via intermediate transitions to the @xmath100 state , the wouthuysen  field process .",
    "as the neutral igm is highly opaque to resonant scattering , the shape of the continuum radiation spectrum near ly@xmath3will follow a boltzmann distribution with a temperature given by the kinetic temperature of the igm ( field 1959 ) . in this case",
    "the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen is a weighted mean between the matter and cmb temperatures .",
    "there exists then a critical value of the background flux of ly@xmath3photons which , if greatly exceeded , would drive the spin temperature away from @xmath97 .    while the microphysics is well understood",
    ", our understanding of the astrophysics of 21cm tomography is still poor . in tozzi",
    "et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) we used n  body cosmological simulations and , assuming a fully neutral medium with @xmath101 , showed that prior to reionization the same network of sheets and filaments ( the ` cosmic web ' ) that gives rise to the forest at @xmath54 should lead to fluctuations in the 21cm brightness temperature at higher redshifts ( figure 3 ) . at 150 mhz ( @xmath102 ) , for observations with a bandwidth of 1 mhz , the root mean square fluctuations should be @xmath103 mk at @xmath104 , decreasing with scale . because of the smoothness of the cmb sky , fluctuations in the 21cm radiation will dominate the cmb fluctuations by about 2 orders of magnitude on arcmin scales .",
    "the search at 21cm for the epoch of first light has become one of the main science drivers of the _ low frequency array _ ( _ lofar _ ; see http://www.astron.nl/lofar/science/ ) . while remaining an extremely challenging project due to foreground contamination from extragalactic radio sources ( di matteo et  al .",
    "2002 ) , the detection and imaging of these small  scale structures with _",
    "lofar _ is a tantalizing possibility within range of the thermal noise of the array .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "there are several effects that need to be examined further . as mentioned above",
    ", it is the presence of a sufficient flux of ly@xmath3photons which renders the neutral igm ` visible ' . without heating sources , the adiabatic expansion of the universe will lower the kinetic temperature of the gas well below that of the cmb , and",
    "the igm will be detectable through its absorption .",
    "if there are sources of radiation that preheat the igm , it may be possible to detect it in emission instead .",
    "the energetic demand for heating the igm above the cmb temperature is meager , only @xmath105 ev per particle at @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , even relatively inefficient heating mechanisms may be important warming sources well before the universe was actually reionized .",
    "perhaps more importantly , prior to full reionization the igm will be a mixture of neutral , partially ionized , and fully ionized structures : low  density regions will be fully ionized first , followed by regions with higher and higher densities .",
    "radio maps at @xmath106 cm will show a patchwork of emission / absorption signals from zones modulated by regions where no signal is detectable against the cmb .",
    "it is the early generation of stars likely responsible for reionization which will also generate a background radiation field of photons with energies between 10.213.6 ev to which the igm is transparent .",
    "as each of these photons gets redshifted , it ultimately reaches the transition energy of 10.2 ev , scatters resonantly off neutral hydrogen , and mixes the hyperfine levels .",
    "the observability of the pre ",
    "reionization igm depends in this case on the uv spectrum of the firsts stars , i.e. on the number of continuum photons emitted per h  ionizing photon .",
    "the integrated uv spectrum of a stellar population is characterized by a strong break at the lyman edge whose size depends on age , initial mass function , and star formation history . in figure 4",
    "we have therefore normalized the rate to the rate of emission of hydrogen  ionizing photons ; after integrating over the stellar age , @xmath107 , a starburst is characterized by a ratio @xmath108 ( scalo imf ) , about three times higher than the constant sfr case ( this is because of the shorter lifetime of the massive stars that produce 1 ryd radiation ) .",
    "it is possible that the startburst mode may be more relevant for the galaxies responsible for reionization , as stellar winds and supernovae can easily expell the gas out of the shallow potential wells of low mass halos , after the first burst of star formation occurs . in this case",
    "the escape fraction might be low until the gas is expelled , and as figure 4 indicates this would contribute to an even stronger continuum emission per ionizing flux ."
