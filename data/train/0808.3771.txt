    "was discovered in 1964 @xcite and soon identified as a high - mass x - ray binary system ( hmxb ) with an orbital period of 5.6d @xcite .",
    "it consists of the supergiant o9.7 star @xcite and a compact object , which is dynamically constrained to be a black hole @xcite .",
    "the detailed spectroscopic analysis of hde226868 by @xcite gives a stellar mass @xmath3 , leading to a mass of @xmath410@xmath5 for the black hole , if an inclination @xmath6 is assumed .",
    "note that @xcite derives a mass of @xmath7 from the evolutionary state of hde226868 , corresponding to @xmath8 , while @xcite claim @xmath9 from x - ray spectral - timing relations .",
    "is usually found in one of the two states that are distinguished by the soft x - ray luminosity and spectral shape , the timing properties , and the radio flux ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) : the low / hard state is characterized by a lower luminosity below 10kev , a hard comptonization power - law spectrum ( photon index @xmath10 ) with a cutoff at high energies ( folding energy @xmath11kev ) and strong variability of @xmath1230% root mean square ( rms ) .",
    "radio emission is detected at the @xmath1215mjy level . in the high / soft state ,",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum is dominated by a bright and much less variable ( only few  % rms ) thermal disk component , and the source is invisible in the radio . within the classification of @xcite , the high / soft state of corresponds to the steep power - law state rather than to the thermal state , as a power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath13 may extend up to @xmath1210mev @xcite .",
    "most of the time , is found in the hard state , but transitions to the soft state and back after a few weeks or months are common every few years . transitional or intermediate states @xcite are often accompanied by radio and/or x - ray flares . similar to a transition to the soft state , the spectrum softens during these flares and the variability is reduced .",
    "this behavior is called a `` failed state transition '' if the true soft state is not reached @xcite .",
    "transitional states have occurred more frequently since mid-1999 than before @xcite , which might indicate changes in the mass - accretion rate due to a slight expansion of hde226868 @xcite .",
    "hmxbs are believed to be powered by accretion from the stellar wind .",
    "the accretion rate and therefore x - ray luminosity and spectral state are thus very sensitive to the wind s detailed properties such as velocity , density , and ionization . for hde226868 , @xcite found an anticorrelation between the h@xmath0 equivalent width ( an indicator for the wind mass loss rate @xmath14 ) and the x - ray flux .",
    "considering the photoionization of the wind would allow for a self - consistent explanation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : a _ lower _ mass loss gives a _ lower _ wind density and therefore _ higher _ degree of ionization due to the irradiation of hard x - rays , which reduces the driving force of hde226868 s uv photons on the wind and results in a _",
    "lower _ wind velocity @xmath15 , leading finally to a _ higher _ accretion rate ( @xmath16 , * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite find suggestions that the photoionization and velocity of the wind might be similar during both hard and soft states .",
    "uv observations allow the photoionization in the hde226868/ system to be probed : @xcite reported pcygni profiles of nv , civ , and siiv with weaker absorption components at orbital phase @xmath17 , i.e. , when the black hole is in the foreground of the supergiant .",
    "this reduced absorption , which was already found by @xcite , is due to the @xcite effect , showing that those ions become superionized by the x - ray source .",
    "@xcite model the orbital variations of the uv lines assuming that the wind of hde226868 is restricted to the shadow wind from the shielded side of the stellar surface @xcite , i.e. , the @xcite zone of extends to the donor star .",
    "however , this assumption applies only to the spherical part of the wind , which might therefore hardly contribute to the mass accretion of .    as hde226868 is close to filling its roche lobe @xcite",
    ", the wind is not spherically symmetrical as for isolated stars , but strongly enhanced toward the black hole .",
    "the strongest wind absorption lines in the optical are therefore observed at the conjunction phases @xcite .",
    "similarly , x - ray absorption dips occur preferentially around @xmath18 , i.e. , during superior conjunction of the black hole @xcite .",
    "these dips are probably caused by dense , neutral clumps , formed in the focused wind where the photoionization is reduced , although recent analyses have also suggested that part of the dipping activity may result from the interaction of the focused wind with the edge of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the photoionization and dynamics of both the spherical and focused winds can also be investigated with the high - resolution grating spectrometers of the modern x - ray observatories _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton_. as none of the previously reported observations of was performed at orbital phase @xmath18 and in the hard state , when the wind is probably denser and less ionized than in the soft state , the _ chandra _ observation presented here allows for the most detailed investigation of the focused wind to date .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : obs ] , we describe our observations of with _",
    "chandra _ and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , and how we model ccd pile - up for the _ chandra_-hetgs data .",
    "we present our investigations in section  [ sec : analysis ] : after investigating the light curves , we model the nondip continuum and analyze neutral absorption edges and absorption lines from the highly ionized stellar wind  and the few emission lines from he - like ions , which indicate two plasma components . in section",

    "for as observed in the hard state , extrapolation of the unabsorbed model obtained by our analysis ( table  [ tab : continuum ] ) gives @xmath23 . although there are obviously strong variations in the density , the xstar calculation has been performed with constant @xmath20 , which is the average of @xmath24 from equation  ( [ eq : nr_numbers ] ) for @xmath25 .",

    "chandra _ only appear at considerable distance from the x - ray source .",
    "taking into account that the photons emanating from first propagate through a lower density wind and that the ( eventually stalled ) wind of higher density is only reached in the vicinity of the star , the actual distances will be even larger than the @xmath26 values quoted in table  [ tab : ionparameter ] .       of equation  ( [ eq : proj_velocity ] ) , i.e. , projected wind velocity against the black hole . a spherically symmetric velocity law given by equations  ( [ eq : vr ] ) and ( [ eq : f ] ) with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29",

    "additional constraints on the accretion flow can be derived by considering the doppler shifts observed in absorption lines ( sections  [ sec : absorptionlines ] and [ sec : absorptionlineseries ] ) .",
    "models for the wind velocity like that of equations  ( [ eq : vr ] ) and ( [ eq : f ] ) predict a velocity @xmath39 at the position @xmath40 in the stellar wind . but only the projection of @xmath41 against the black hole , @xmath35 , can eventually be observed as radial velocity in an x - ray absorption line . with the angle @xmath42 between @xmath39 and the direction from @xmath40 toward the black hole",
    ", @xmath31 is @xmath43 assuming a velocity field with radial symmetry with respect to the star , @xmath42 is just the angle at @xmath40 between the star and the black hole .",
    "for example , @xmath0 is @xmath44 ( and @xmath35 is therefore 0 ) on the sphere containing the center of the star and the black hole diametrically opposed .",
    "redshifted absorption lines can only be observed from wind material inside this sphere , while the part of the wind outside of it is always seen at a blueshift  a fact which is independent of the assumed velocity field as long as it is directed radially away from the star .    for a spherically symmetrical wind model , any line of sight",
    "can be rotated to an equivalent one in a half - plane limited by the binary axis .",
    "only a sector with half - opening angle  @xmath45 can be observed unless the system s inclination is @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ fig : proj_velocity ] shows the projected velocity @xmath31 for a simple wind model and two sectors containing all observable lines of sight toward for an inclination of @xmath38 .",
    "we now investigate the region where the projected wind velocity ( figure  [ fig : proj_velocity ] ) is compatible with the observed doppler shifts ( tables  [ tab : h - he - like_velocityshifts ] and [ tab : lineseries ] ) .",
    "we are confident that this method allows for the identification of the absorption regions , as the low observed velocities are always found close to the @xmath47 sphere ",
    "independent of the wind model . for most of the investigated ions ( nex , mgxii , sixiv and xiii , sxv , arxvii , fexix and xviii ) the inferred distance from the black hole agrees with the predictions of table  [",
    "tab : ionparameter ] , e.g. , the projected velocity @xmath48kms@xmath49kms@xmath2 measured for nex is ( during @xmath50 ) obtained at @xmath51 . for many other ions , both results are still very similar : e.g. , neix with @xmath52kms@xmath53kms@xmath2",
    "is expected at @xmath54 from the @xmath35 model and at @xmath552.8 from the photoionization model . only for the highly ionized iron lines , the small distances are  as already anticipated in section  [ sec : xstar ]  underestimated by the xstar simulation run with constant average density , which overestimates the wind density close to the black hole .",
    "for example , the velocity range @xmath56kms@xmath57kms@xmath2 measured for fexxiv corresponds to @xmath58 , while the population of this ion peaks at @xmath591.1 within the model presented in table  [ tab : ionparameter ] .          in previous _",

    "] when was in a transitional state .",
    "they derive a neutral column density of @xmath61 from prominent absorption edges ( see also table  [ tab : neutralabundances ] ) and detect some emission and absorption lines with indications of p  cygni profiles . @xcite have investigated the focused wind with the 32ks observation obsid  2415 of in an intermediate state , performed in 2001 january ( at @xmath62 ) .",
    "they report absorption and emission lines of h- and he - like resonance lines of ne , na , mg , and si with a mean redshift of @xmath63100kms@xmath2 , as well as some lines of highly ionized fe and ni .",
    "the column density is @xmath64 @xcite . @xcite",
    "describe ly@xmath0 and he@xmath0 absorption lines , redshifted by @xmath65 from the 12.6ks observation obsid  1511 of in the hard state , performed in 2001 january ( at @xmath66 ) .",
    "@xcite report dramatic variability in the 30ks observation obsid  3407 performed in 2001 october ( at @xmath67 ) , when reached its soft state .",
    "while a large number of absorption lines ( mostly redshifted , but not by a consistent velocity ) is identified in the first part of their observation , most of them weaken significantly or can not be detected at all during the second part .",
    "the complete ionization of the wind due to a sudden density decrement is given as a possible explanation .",
    "@xcite detect asymmetric absorption lines with the 26ks observation obsid  3724 of in the soft state , performed in 2002 july ( at @xmath18 ) .",
    "the line centers are almost at their rest wavelengths , but the red wings are more extended , especially for the transitions of highest ionized ions , which they explain by the inflowing focused wind reaching both the highest redshift and ionization parameter closest to the black hole .",
    "the interpretation of the absorption lines presented in the previous section describes our observation consistent with wind and photoionization models .",
    "it can , however , not be applied to all of the other observations ; the model of figure  [ fig : proj_velocity ] neither predicts a conspicuously high redshift at @xmath66 and at a higher soft x - ray flux ( obsid  1511 ) , nor a positive redshift at @xmath62 at a still higher flux ( obsid  2415 , see figure  [ fig : observations ] ) . inhomogeneities ( e.g. , density enhancements in shielding clumps ) and asymmetries of the wind ( e.g. , due to noninertial forces in the binary system ) may therefore play an important role in these cases .      in this paper , we have presented a _ chandra_-hetgs observation of during superior conjunction of the black hole , which allows us to detect the x - ray absorption signatures of the stellar wind of hde226868 .",
    "the light curve near @xmath18 is shaped by absorption dips ; these are , however , excluded from this analysis by selecting nondip times of high count rate only . at a flux of @xmath120.25crab , we have to deal with moderate pile - up in the grating spectra , for which can be accounted very well with the ` simple_gpile2 ` model .",
    "the continuum of both _",
    "s soft and _ rxte _ s broadband x - ray spectrum has been described consistently by a single model , consisting of an empirical broken power - law spectrum with high - energy cutoff ( which is typical for the hard state ) and a subordinated disk component with an inner radius close to the isco .",
    "the joint modeling of both spectra reveals the presence of both a narrow and a relativistically broadened fluorescence fe k@xmath0 line .",
    "_ chandra _ has resolved absorption edges of neutral atoms with an overabundance of metals , suggesting an origin not only in the ism , but also in the stellar wind of the evolved supergiant .",
    "the previously suspected anticorrelation of neutral column densities and x - ray flux , which is due to photoionization , is confirmed .",
    "absorption lines of highly ionized ions are produced where the wind becomes extremely photoionized .",
    "for h- and he - like ions , lyman and he - series are detected up to the ly or he@xmath68 line , which we use to measure the column density and velocity of absorbing ions .",
    "for the wealth of fe l - shell transitions , column densities can best be obtained by directly using a physical model for the complete line series of an ion .",
    "the nondip spectrum shows almost no doppler shifts , probably indicating that we have excluded the focused wind by our selection of nondip times .",
    "we have also detected two plasma components in emission by two pairs of i- and f - lines of he - like mgxi .",
    "the first one is roughly at rest and we identify it with the base of the spherical wind close to the stellar surface .",
    "the second plasma component is denser and observed at a redshift that is compatible with the focused wind .",
    "a simple xstar simulation indicates that most of the observed ions only exist in a distance of the black hole , where the velocity of a spherical wind , projected against the black hole , is low  which is a consistent explanation of the small doppler shifts observed in absorption lines .",
    "we review the previously reported _",
    "chandra _ observations of and find that not all of them can be described in the same picture , as the wind may be affected by asymmetries or inhomogeneities . a detailed spectroscopy of the absorption dips , which might shed more light on the focused wind , will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
