    "the description of many phenomena in terms of a two level system ( tls ) can be found in different areas of chemical physics ( chiral molecules @xcite , electron transfer reactions @xcite ) , quantum optics @xcite , high energy physics @xcite and quantum computation @xcite , among many others fields of research . however , the isolated tls is not complex enough to provide a richer and more complete image of the basic microscopic processes underlying its dynamics .",
    "for example , very often the system is coupled to a more extended system or environment consisting of many degrees of freedom usually represented by an infinite set of harmonic oscillators .",
    "thus , several extensions of the isolated tls have been taken into account along the years to account properly for dissipative and stochastic processes due to interactions with an environment at finite temperature .",
    "in general , the tls is linearly coupled to the coordinates of a bath of noninteracting oscillators , whose properties are encoded in their spectral density @xcite ( the spin  boson model ) .",
    "several approaches within the matrix density formalism have been proposed and implemented to determine the time evolution of the dissipative tls such as path  integral methods or the bloch ",
    "redfield formalism @xcite . in the path",
    " integral formalism , the so  called non - interacting blip approximation ( niba ) breaks down for non - zero bias and low temperatures even for weak damping , and a theory beyond the niba for a biased system has been developed @xcite .",
    "variational calculations have also been carried out for both the symmetric ( or unbiased ) @xcite and asymmetric ( or biased ) cases @xcite .",
    "alternatively , following an approach to the dynamics of the tls due to feynman in his elegant dynamical theory of the josephson effect @xcite , it was shown that classical and quantum mechanics may be embedded in the same hamiltonian formulation by using complex canonical coordinates @xcite . in particular , for electronically non  adiabatic processes , meyer and miller @xcite ( following some earlier work by mccurdy and miller @xcite ) shown the possibility of representing each electronic state by a pair of classical action - angle variables",
    ". however , instead of these variables , cartesian electronic variables have been extensively used because of the simpler algebraic form of the hamiltonian . this approach and some of its extensions",
    "have been employed by several groups ( for a complete list of references on the development and applications of this method , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , by using the action  angle variables , this formalism has also been recently implemented to study the dissipative dynamics ( zero temperature ) of chiral molecules . in this case",
    ", the asymmetry of the assumed double well potential model is due to the parity violating energy difference @xcite .",
    "a natural extension of this dynamics is to include the temperature effect along with a noise term .    in this spirit , this is the first of a series of upcoming articles in which we describe , implement and apply a langevin canonical approach to the dynamics of the chiral tls interacting with an environment at finite temperatures .",
    "section ii is devoted to introduce the canonical formalism for an isolated chiral tls , as well as its usual connection with the density matrix approach and the corresponding thermodynamics .",
    "finite temperature effects are included by means of noise  induced dynamics via a caldeira ",
    "leggett  like hamiltonian .",
    "numerical simulations of this stochastic approach are presented and discussed in section iii , where population differences ( which are proportional , for example , to the optical activity in chiral systems @xcite ) as well as coherences are issued by assuming an ohmic regime in a broad range of temperatures . in particular , the competition between the tunneling and the asymmetry or bias displayed by the tls is analyzed in terms of a critical temperature which is defined by the maximum of the heat capacity and separates the coherent and incoherent tunneling regimes . in all cases ,",
    "these two regimes are discussed in the framework of a theory beyond the niba , path  integral analytical expressions in order to validate this stochastic dynamics .",
    "even more , the corresponding thermodynamic functions are obtained from this stochastic analysis at asymptotic times where the thermal equilibrium is reached .",
    "finally , section iv presents the main conclusions and future perspectives of the formalism here employed .",
    "let us consider an isolated chiral tls described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 stand for the pauli matrices .",
    "the isolated system is usually modelled in a phenomenological way by a two - well ( asymmetric ) potential within the born - oppenheimer approximation . from the knowledge of the eigenstates , @xmath2 , the left and right states ( or chiral states ) , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , can be expressed by means of a rotation of angle @xmath5 given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 ) describes the tunneling rate and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 can be positive or negative ) accounts for the asymmetry due to the electroweak parity violation ( for a chiral system ) or any other bias term ( for example , a magnetic field ) .    among other interesting representations of the isolated system @xcite , an alternative and useful way of looking at it is based on the polar decomposition of the complex amplitudes entering the wave function .",
    "the solutions of the time - dependent schdinger equation ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 can be written as @xmath13 .",
    "if the complex amplitudes are written in polar form as @xmath14 , and the population and phase differences between chiral states are defined as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , it is an easy exercise to prove that the average energy in the normalized @xmath17 state is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 represents a hamiltonian function .",
    "as @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be seen as a pair of canonically conjugate variables , the heisenberg equations of motion ( which are formally identical to the hamilton equations ) are easily derived from @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "explicitly , the non - linear coupled equations describing the isolated system in these canonical variables are @xmath24 thus , eqs .",
    "( [ tlqseq ] ) are totally equivalent to the usual time -dependent schrdinger equation ( [ se ] ) .",
    "in fact , the exact quantum beating expression can be obtained by noting that @xmath19 is a conserved magnitude @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", the adimensional time @xmath25 will be used in the rest of this work .",
    "this re - scaling implies that the hamiltonian function @xmath19 is expressed again as @xmath26 notice that the first term of the hamiltonian function ( [ h ] ) accounts for the tunneling process and the second one for the underlying asymmetry ( due to a bias or the parity - violating energy difference ) putting on evidence the two competing processes in this simple dynamics .",
    "finally , the connection between the canonical and the density matrix formalism can be established as follows .",
    "let @xmath27 be the density matrix for the tls , whose matrix elements are given by @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "on the other hand , from @xmath32 , one obtains that the time average values of the pauli operators are given by @xmath33 which is consistent with @xmath34 and @xmath35 the time population difference can also be split into two components which are symmetric and antisymmetric under the inversion operation consisting of replacing @xmath10 by @xmath36 .",
    "the dynamics of the isolated chiral tls can be reduced to simply solve eqs .",
    "( [ tlqseq ] ) and then form appropriate combinations of @xmath20 and @xmath21 to recover the populations and coherences . when dealing with interactions with the environment consisting of a high number of degrees of freedom , more sophisticated theoretical approaches are needed .",
    "they can be widely classified into three frameworks according to the picture of quantum mechanics used @xcite : the density operator formalism and the stochastic schrdinger equation ( schrdinger and interaction picture ) , and the generalized langevin equation ( heisenberg picture ) . due to the fact the formalism used here to describe the dynamics of a tls is very much attached to the definition of a hamiltonian function ( [ h ] ) ,",
    "the last framework is much more convenient , apart from being much less employed in the theory of open quantum systems . within this canonical formalism , a caldeira  leggett  like hamiltonian , @xcite where a bilinear coupling between the tls and the environment is assumed , is usually found in the literature . in particular , we have recently developed this formalism to study the dissipative dynamics of chiral systems @xcite .    as previously stated @xcite , noting that @xmath21 and @xmath20 play the role of a generalized coordinate and momentum , respectively , one can introduce interactions with the environment by means of a system - bath bilinear coupling _ via _ a caldeira ",
    "like hamiltonian expressed as @xmath37 where the sums run over the coordinates of the bath oscillators @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are suitable dimensionless constants representing generalized masses , couplings with the environment , and oscillator frequencies , respectively .",
    "although the requirement of a bilinear coupling has been relaxed in a previous publication @xcite , it will be retained here for simplicity .",
    "it should also be noticed that the usual spin  boson hamiltonian has been implemented in the meyer  miller ",
    "thoss representation by coupling the bath position coordinate with the population difference of the tls ( see eq .",
    "( 2.11 ) of @xcite ) . on the contrary , in the approach here employed ,",
    "it is the phase difference of the tls the canonical variable which is coupled to the bath position coordinate , not the population difference .",
    "it follows quite closely that employed in the field of condensed matter , the dynamics of a josephson junction @xcite .",
    "this phase difference is coupled to the degrees of freedom of the bath which also acts as a source of phase fluctuations . within this scheme ,",
    "the corresponding coupled langevin - type dynamical equations are given by @xmath42 where the time - dependent friction ( damping kernel ) is expressed as @xmath43 and the fluctuation force or noise is given by @xmath44 which depends on the initial conditions of both the system and the bath .",
    "taking the bath oscillators as classical variables ( classical noise ) , moderate  to",
    " high temperature regimes are expected to be properly described by this approach , as will be discussed through the rest of the manuscript .",
    "if a markovian regime is assumed , the standard properties of the fluctuation force ( gaussian white noise ) are given by the following canonical thermal averages : @xmath45 ( zero average ) and @xmath46 ( delta - correlated ) where @xmath47 , @xmath48 being boltzmann s constant .",
    "the friction is then described by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a constant and @xmath51 is dirac s @xmath52function ( not to be confused with the @xmath52-parameter describing the tunneling rate ) .",
    "thus , in this regime , eqs .",
    "( [ stochohm ] ) read now @xmath53 the corresponding solutions provide stochastic trajectories for the population and phase differences encoding all the information on the dynamics of the non - isolated tls . these solutions are dependent on the four dimensional parameter space @xmath54 , apart from the initial conditions @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in terms of the averages of pauli operators",
    ", we have now the condition @xmath57 instead of condition ( [ nodamping ] ) .",
    "the use of classical noise imposes some restrictions on the range of temperatures where this approach remains valid . at high temperatures , @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 )",
    "thermal effects are going to be predominant over quantum effects which become relevant , in general , at times of the order of or less than @xmath60 , sometimes also called thermal time .",
    "however , in general , at very low temperatures , @xmath61 ( or @xmath62 ) the noise is colored and its correlation function is complex and our approach is no longer valid .",
    "the dissipative dynamics in the classical noise regime is obtained at zero noise or zero temperature @xcite .",
    "this regime has already been considered elsewhere @xcite .",
    "canonical thermal averages of population and phase differences as a function of time @xmath63 and @xmath64 are issued from running a high number of stochastic trajectories .",
    "the role of initial conditions has been extensively discussed in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) and we are not going to deal with this important issue . in our dynamical study ,",
    "the system will be prepared in one of the chiral states , left or right ( @xmath65 or @xmath66 in order to avoid initial singularities ) , and the initial phase difference @xmath67 will be uniformly distributed around the interval @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "this approach should recover the main equilibrium thermodynamics properties of the non - isolated tls from the stochastic dynamics at asymptotic times .",
    "a detailed analysis of the thermodynamics of non - interacting chiral molecules assuming a canonical distribution was carried out elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in particular , thermal averages of pseudoscalar operators were extensively analyzed .",
    "the canonical thermal average of an observable @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 is given by ( [ h ] ) and @xmath73 is the partition function .",
    "for chiral states , @xmath74 with @xmath75 and the corresponding averages for the population difference and coherences ( in the l ",
    "r basis ) are then calculated to give @xmath76 from the knowledge of the partition function , the remaining equilibrium thermodynamical functions are also easily deduced such as the helmholtz free energy , the entropy , the heat capacity , etc .",
    "from such an analysis , a critical temperature given by @xcite @xmath77 is derived when @xmath78 displays an inflection point and the heat capacity a maximum as a function of the temperature . at temperatures higher than @xmath79 ,",
    "the effect of @xmath10 is masked by thermal effects which tend to wash out the population difference @xmath20 ( racemization ) . at temperatures lower than @xmath79 ,",
    "the value of the ratio @xmath80 is critical .",
    "when this ratio is close to unity , @xmath81 is determined by the competition between tunneling and asymmetry or bias . when it is much greater than one , the tunneling process plays a minor role and @xmath81 keeps more or less its initial value .",
    "finally , when this ratio is much less than one , the racemization is always present .    in a previous work @xcite",
    ", it was showed that at very low temperatures , a chiral or two level bosonic system could display condensation as well as a discontinuity in the heat capacity ( reduced temperatures @xmath82 ) . in this work",
    ", we are going to assume that in this temperature regime the maxwell - boltzman ( canonical ) distribution still applies , instead of the bose - einstein statistics , in order to know if the thermodynamics can also be reached within this formalism with a classical noise .",
    "otherwise , a colored noise and a generalized langevin equation formalism should be applied .",
    "finally , it is worth stressing that the thermodynamic functions are independent on the friction coefficient in the weak coupling limit .",
    "thus , our average values of population differences issued from this stochastic dynamics are independent on the friction coefficient as time goes to infinity , that is , when the thermal equilibrium with the bath is reached . in the strong coupling limit ,",
    "this fact no longer holds @xcite .",
    "the general strategy consist of solving the pair of non - linear coupled equations ( [ stochohm1 ] ) for the canonical variables under the action of a gaussian white noise , which is implemented by using an ermak  like approach @xcite .",
    "notice that in the langevin  like coupled equations to be solved , the noise term only appears in the equation of motion of the @xmath20variable .",
    "the phase variable has been taken to be uniformly distributed between @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in order to avoid the singular behavior found at @xmath85 , the initial value for @xmath20",
    "will be chosen to be around @xmath86 , very far from the equilibrium condition . moreover , when running trajectories there are some of them visiting `` un - physical '' regions , that is , @xmath87 .",
    "this drawback is mainly associated with the intensity of the noise since , for large values of it ( which depends on both the temperature and the friction coefficient ) , the stochastic @xmath20trajectories can become unbounded . to overcome this problem ,",
    "we have implemented a _ reflecting _ condition such that , for instance , when the trajectory reaches @xmath88 , we change its value to @xmath89 .",
    "the time step used goes from @xmath90 to @xmath91 ( dimensionless units ) depending strongly on the regime to be explored in order to follow properly the corresponding dynamics : high or moderate temperature regimes and localized or delocalized regimes . as noted in @xcite , unstable trajectories",
    "can also be found for certain values of @xmath10 , @xmath52 and @xmath50 in the simple case of dissipative but non  noisy dynamics . as this problem persists in case of dealing with stochastic trajectories ,",
    "not every triple @xmath92 gives place to a stable trajectory . in these cases ,",
    "the time evolution of individual trajectories is not possible and a previous stability analysis is mandatory .",
    "however , in the stable case , a satisfactory description of population differences and coherences has been achieved by running up to @xmath93 trajectories in all cases considered .      in this subsection , thermal effects both in the population difference and coherences",
    "will be studied , extending previous results in which only dissipative dynamics ( that is , at zero temperature ) was considered @xcite .",
    "specifically , we will focus on the role of the critical temperature such that , roughly speaking , separates coherent from incoherent tunneling . regarding the internal dynamics of the tls , we start analyzing the delocalized regime where @xmath94 .",
    "in particular , we have taken @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "given these values , the critical temperature is @xmath97 in units of @xmath98 .",
    "thus , to study its effects in the dynamics , temperatures ranging from 200 to 0.4 ( in units of @xmath98 ) have been considered . as the friction has been taken to be a constant value , @xmath99 , both moderate and high temperature regimes ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively ) are covered .",
    "the propagation time step has been taken to be between @xmath90 ( high temperatures ) and @xmath91 ( moderate temperatures ) .",
