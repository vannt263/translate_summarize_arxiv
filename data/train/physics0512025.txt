    "the ground states of the two - electron systems bound by the nucleus are described by the wave functions , depending on three variables .",
    "these can be the distances between the electrons and the nucleus @xmath4 and the interelectron distance @xmath5 .",
    "here we shall find analytical expressions , which would approximate the solutions of the schrdinger equation @xmath0 in the special cases @xmath1 and @xmath2 : @xmath6 we shall consider the ground states of helium atom and of the light heliumlike ions , including also the negative ion of hydrogen @xmath3 . in this paper we shall treat the ground states only .",
    "thus , the total spin of the two - electron system is equal to zero .",
    "note that this problem differs strongly from the traditional problem of approximating the total wave function @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "there are numerous wave functions of this kind , with the approximate functions being usually certain combinations of exponentials and polynomials , while a set of fitting parameters is found by minimization of the energy functional .",
    "thus , the quality of such functions is determined by the accuracy of reprodusing the binding energy value . since the averaged value of the hamiltonian is determined by the distances , which are of the order of the size of the atom , such functions provide very good approximation at these distances . however , as it was emphasized already in @xcite , they are not necessary as precise in the limiting cases @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the motivation of our study is that in a number of dynamical problems one needs the bound state wave functions in the such region of variables , where one of the distances is much smaller then the other ones .",
    "this takes place in those processes on the bound electrons , which are kinematically forbidden for the free ones .",
    "for example , the high energy asymptotic of photoionization is expressed in terms of the two - electron function @xmath7 , where @xmath8 or @xmath9 is zero @xcite .",
    "the same is correct for the nonrelativistic high energy asymptotic of the double photoionization , and for the energy distribution of the compton scattering at sufficiently small energies of the outgoing electrons .",
    "some of the characteristics of the double photoionization are expressed in terms of the two - electron function with zero interelectron distance @xmath10 @xcite . the straitforward way to obtain the functions @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 is to calculate them from @xmath0 , that could be derived numerically .",
    "this is a rather complex procedure .",
    "therefore here we shall build the approximate wave functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 based on the known behavior of the exact wave function only near the triple coalescence point @xmath15 .",
    "the only free parameter of our approach is the value of the wave functions at the coordinate origin @xmath16 our approach was initiated and encouraged by the large role of the proper treatment of the two - particle coalescence point in the earlier calculations .",
    "for example , the binding energies can be reproduced usually with a good accuracy by the approximate wave functions , which are certain combinations of exponential and polynomial factors @xcite .",
    "such presentation is good enough at distances of the order of the atomic size .",
    "however , it was understood long ago that the analytical dependence upon @xmath17 is not as simple as that , and the logarithmic terms are presented in the expansion of the wave function near the origin @xcite .",
    "later it was found that , if @xmath4 or @xmath5 turn to zero , the solution of the schrdinger equation should satisfy the specific kato conditions @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the logarithmic terms @xcite , or accounting of the kato conditions @xcite or both @xcite does not influence much the energy value , but improves strongly the convergence of the procedure of @xmath0 calculations .",
    "this encouraged us to try a rather simple approach .",
    "as it is shown in this paper , the approximate functions for ( 1 ) appear to be @xmath18 ; \\quad \\phi_a(r)=n\\exp(-2zr)\\ .\\ ] ]    they have to be compared to precise or highly accurate locally correct functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "as such , we use the functions obtained by the correlation function hyperspherical harmonic ( cfhh ) method @xcite .",
    "these non - variational wave functions of the two - electron system bound by a light nucleus in @xmath21-state have been obtained by direct solution of the three - body schrdinger equation @xcite , without additional approximations .",
    "they require complicated computer codes for being employed .",
    "the way we construct the approximate wave functions insures that they reproduce the cfhh functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 with good accuracy at sufficiently small values @xmath17 .",
    "the question is , how long this can last , while @xmath17 increases . in other words",
    ", we must calculate the characteristics of the processes , which are determined by @xmath11 and @xmath12 at @xmath17 being of the order of the size of the atom , and compare the results obtained with ( 3 ) and with the cfhh functions .",
    "the answer is that the relative discrepancy between functions ( 3 ) and cfhh functions does not exceed several percents at characteristic distances @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the same is the accuracy of the photoionization characteristics .    of course , such accuracy would not have been sufficient for the calculation of the static atomic characteristics , e.g. of the energy levels values . however , e.g. there was qualitative controversy in theoretical results on the double photoionization energy distribution until recent time @xcite , with quantitative results differing by orders of magnitude",
    ". thus it would be unjustified to run for too high accuracy in any case .",
    "on the other hand , good accuracy of the functions ( 2 ) prompts a basis for expansion of the cfhh functions . since the functions ( 3 ) have the radial dependence of the @xmath24-functions in the coulomb fields with charges @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively",
    ", one can present the numerical cfhh functions as linear combinations of the functions of this field with the dominative contribution coming from @xmath24 terms .",
    "we build our approximate wave functions and discuss their relation to other approaches in sec.2 .",
    "we analyze expansion of cfhh functions at two - particle coalescence points in series of the single particle eigenfunctions of coulomb fields in sec.3 .",
    "we consider the applications in sec.4 , and summarize in sec.5 .",
    "atomic system of units is used through the paper .",
    "it is known that at small distances @xmath27 the solution of the schrdinger equation can be presented as @xcite @xmath28,\\ ] ] with @xmath29 .",
    "the explicit form of the quadratic terms was found in @xcite .",
    "eq.(4 ) is consistent with more general kato conditions @xcite , @xmath30 which are fulfilled for the cfhh functions . using eq.(4 )",
    "we find that at @xmath27 @xmath31 ; \\quad \\phi(r)=n\\left(1 - 2zr+ ... \\right)\\,,\\ ] ] with the dots denoting the higher terms .",
    "this provides @xmath32 and @xmath33    we require eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) to be satisfied by our approximate functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 for all @xmath17 .",
    "this leads to eq.(3 ) .",
    "the functions ( 3 ) correspond to a very simple physical pictures .",
    "note that ( 3 ) look like the @xmath24 functions in the coulomb fields with charges @xmath34 and @xmath26 , respectively , that serve in fact as a sort of adjustable parameters .",
    "@xmath17 dependence is one of @xmath24 electron , while the small probability of the three - particle coalescence is contained in the factor @xmath35 determined by eq.(2 ) .",
    "we calculate the latter by using the cfhh functions .",
    "to characterize the quality of our approximate functions , we introduce the @xmath36 with the lower indices cfhh denotes the wave functions obtained in @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the functions ( 3 ) increases rapidly with the nuclear charge @xmath37 growth .",
    "however even for the negative ion @xmath3 ( @xmath38 ) the accuracy is rather high . at characteristic @xmath39 , and @xmath40",
    "the errors of the function @xmath41 for h@xmath42 make 6% , being less than 1% for the function @xmath43 .",
    "the errors increase at larger values of @xmath17 .",
    "they exceed the value of 10% at the distances , at which the wave functions are already very small .",
    "the functions @xmath44 ( 9 ) , describing @xmath17-dependence of the errors are presented in fig .",
    "1 . we present the results for helium ( @xmath45 ) since most of the studies of the two - electron systems are carried out for this case .",
    "we give also the results for @xmath46 to illustrate @xmath37 dependence . a curve for @xmath3 ( @xmath38 )",
    "is also presented , since this case is the most difficult for investigations .",
    "the dip on the graph of fig .",
    "1a is a result of the logarithmic scale , since the logarithm of the absolute value of the difference of the two functions goes to @xmath47 at the points where the difference changes sign .",
    "the overall accuracy of the solution therefore can be inferred only at the values of r not too close to the dip .",
    "one can see that the discrepancy with cfhh functions becomes much greater at @xmath17 becoming of the order of the size of the atom , comparing to that at smaller @xmath17 . however , the precision is still good enough for obtaining results with the accuracy of several percents .",
    "the values of @xmath35 , the latter being defined by eq.(2 ) are presented in table 1 . at large @xmath37",
    "the single - particle hydrogenlike model is expected to become increasingly true , since the interaction between the electrons is @xmath37 times weaker than their interaction with the nucleus .",
    "hence , in the limit @xmath48 @xmath49 the results presented in table 1 illustrate this tendency",
    ". as expected , deviations from the limiting law ( 10 ) are of the order @xmath50 .",
    "the actual results are smaller than predicted by ( 10 ) since the latter does not include the electron repulsion , which diminishes this value .    of course",
    ", there are numerous simple approximate wave functions of the type @xmath51 which are build in order to calculate the ground state energy values @xcite , thus approximating the solutions of the schrdinger equation at @xmath4 of the order @xmath50 ( in the case of @xmath52 they had to reproduce also the very existence of the bound state ) . technically , they turn to the single - exponential forms at @xmath53 and do not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "these functions can be compared to our functions @xmath12 defined by eq.(3 ) .",
    "but they do not approximate the locally correct cfhh functions @xmath54 , and , following @xcite , are not supposed to .",
    "we illustrate this statement by presenting in fig.2 the cfhh function @xmath12 , our function ( 3 ) and the screened coulomb wave function @xmath55 with @xmath56 for helium @xcite",
    ".    in @xcite the function @xmath11 for @xmath52 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 was approximated by a hydrogenlike function with the effective charge @xmath59 treated as a variational parameter .",
    "the values of @xmath59 for @xmath60 have been found to be 0.58 , 1.53 and 2.52 , correspondingly . in @xcite",
    "the function @xmath11 for the ion @xmath52 have been analyzed at large distances .",
    "we do not claim our functions to be true in this @xmath17-region , which is not essential for us since of prime importance is the @xmath17 domain within the atomic radius .",
    "the @xmath17 dependence of the approximate wave functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( 3 ) is the same as that of @xmath24 functions in the coulomb fields of the nuclei with the charges @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the high precision of these functions suggests that the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equations in these fields compose convenient series for expansion of the cfhh functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    introducing the common notation @xmath63 for the functions @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 we present the normalized functions @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "thus @xmath66 .    in the expansions over the complete sets of some eigenfunctions",
    ", @xmath67 can be presented as : @xmath68 with @xmath69 denoting the sum over the states of discrete spectrum and integration over continuum @xmath70 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 normalized to one , it is @xmath73 choosing the solutions of the schrdinger equations in the coulomb fields with the charges @xmath61 and @xmath62 as the functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively , we find the values @xmath74 and @xmath75 presented in table 2 . for atomic helium @xmath76 , @xmath77",
    ". high accuracy of the functions ( 3 ) corresponds to domination of the terms @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the sums ( 13 ) .",
    "the precision of calculations can be improved by adding the contributions of the higher states according to eq.(12 ) .",
    "of course , in our case only the @xmath21-states are involved .",
    "for example , @xmath80 , @xmath81 in the case of atomic helium .",
    "the results for the other values of @xmath37 are presented in table 2 .",
    "this procedure enables to achieve any desired accuracy , controlled by eq .",
    "as we said above , one of the possible application of the functions ( 3 ) is the high energy photoionization processes .",
    "let us start with the single photoionization .",
    "the high energy nonrelativistic asymptotic for the k - shell ionization cross section can be written as @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is electron mass ans @xmath84 is the speed of light .",
    "the properties of the ionized states contained in the factor @xmath85 here f(r ) is determined by eq.(1 ) , while @xmath86 is the single - particle function of the k - electron in residual ion .",
    "in our case @xmath86 is just the @xmath24 function of the coulomb field with the charge @xmath37 .    in the single - particle approximation c",
    "is simply the value of the single - particle wave function at the coordinate origin . to illustrate the quality of the functions ( 3 ) we compare the results for the factor @xmath87 calculated by using the cfhh functions and the functions ( 3 ) . in the latter case",
    "we find an analytic expression @xmath88 providing @xmath89 for the case of atomic helium .",
    "the numerical calculations with the cfhh functions give @xmath90 in this case .",
    "hence , employing the approximate function ( 3 ) leads to the error of @xmath91 .",
    "earlier the authors of @xcite found that the value of @xmath87 obtained by using the hylleraas - type variational function is well approximated by employing a hydrogenlike function with @xmath92 .",
    "now let us turn to the case of the double photoionization .",
    "the shape of the spectrum curve of the double photoionization changes with the photon energy growth .",
    "the mechanisms which cause these changes are explained in @xcite . while the photon energy @xmath93 is smaller than certain value @xmath94 , the energy distribution approaches its minimum at the central point , with the equal energies of the outgoing electrons , @xmath95 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath96 . there is a peak at the central point at @xmath97 , which splits into two at @xmath98 .",
    "thus , there is a local minimum at @xmath96 at @xmath98 .",
    "the values of @xmath99 were obtained in @xcite by using the cfhh functions .",
    "we shall not repeat derivation of the corresponding equations here .",
    "we rather explain their origin and put them down , in order to illustrate , how the functions ( 3 ) enable to obtain approximate solutions .",
    "the values of @xmath99 can be presented as solutions of the following equation , which involves the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite : @xmath100 with @xmath101 being a certain numerical coefficient , and @xmath102 while the function @xmath103 depends on @xmath93 in a more complicated way : @xmath104 with @xmath105    employing the exact cfhh functions requires tedious computations .",
    "however , using the approximate wave functions ( 3 ) one can obtain analytical expressions for both left - hand side and right - hand side of eq.(17 ) .",
    "putting @xmath106 and @xmath107 we obtain @xmath108 , while @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "the values of @xmath99 obtained by using the cfhh functions and the functions ( 3 ) are presented in table 3 .",
    "one can see that the discrepancy between two sets of results drops rapidly with @xmath37 growth .",
    "being 22% for h@xmath42 and 9% for helium , it becomes 4% for @xmath46 .",
    "we build very simple analytical presentations ( 3 ) , for the wave functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 describing ground states of two - electron systems bound by the coulomb field of the nucleus in the space regions @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the presentation is based on the behavior of the exact solution of the schrdinger equation near the three - particle coalescence singularity .",
    "comparing our functions ( 3 ) to the locally correct cfhh functions for the ion @xmath3 , atomic helium and light heliumlike ions ( relativistic corrections , which are of the order @xmath111 are not included ) , we found good agreement in a large interval of the values of the @xmath17 .",
    "as is evident the precision of the approximate functions increases with the nuclear charge @xmath37 growth .",
    "we show that the solutions of the single - particle schrdinger equations in the coulomb fields with the charges @xmath61 and @xmath62 provide natural basis for expansion of the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 with the domination of @xmath24 terms .",
    "the latter tendency increases with @xmath37 .",
    "the approach is more precise for the function @xmath11 , then for @xmath12 .",
    "the high precision of such a simple approximation that properly treats singularities in the wave function is in agreement with the conventional believe that the singularities determine such important atomic characteristics as high - energy photoionization cross sections .",
