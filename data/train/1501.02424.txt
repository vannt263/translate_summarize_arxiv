    "because of significant applications in scientific and engineering computing , superconvergence analysis of finite element methods has become an active subject since 70 s last century . however ,",
    "most of attentions have been paid on conforming and mixed finite element methods of second order problems , we refer interested readers to @xcite for more details . since conforming finite element methods of fourth order problems are very complicated , most of popularly used elements in practice are nonconforming , for instance , @xcite . however , for nonconforming finite elements , due to nonconformity of both trial and test functions , it becomes much more difficult to establish superconvergence properties and related asymptotic error expansions . for second order elliptic problems , there are a few superconvergence results on rectangular elements . in @xcite ,",
    "superconvergence of the gradient was obtained at the centers of elements for the wilson element , which relies on the observation that the wilson element space can be split into a conforming part and a nonconforming part . due to superconvergence of consistency errors , superconvergence of",
    "the nonconforming rotated @xmath0 element @xcite and its variants was derived , see @xcite . for the plate bending problem , there are only few superconvergence results for nonconforming finite elements . in @xcite ,",
    "chen first established the supercloseness of the corrected interpolation of the incomplete biquadratic element @xcite on uniform rectangular meshes . by using similar corrected interpolations as in @xcite , mao et al .",
    "@xcite first proved one and a half - order superconvergence for the morley element @xcite and the incomplete biquadratic nonconforming element on uniform rectangular meshes . in a recent paper @xcite , hu and",
    "ma proposed a new method by using equivalence between the morley element and the first order hellan - herrmann - johnson element and obtained one and a half - order superconvergence for the morley element on uniform mesh . that half order superconvergence can be improved to one order superconvergence if the third order normal derivative of exact solutions vanishes on the boundary of the domain under consideration .",
    "based on the equivalence to the stokes equations and a superconvergence result of ye @xcite on the crouzeix ",
    "raivart element , huang et al .",
    "@xcite derived the superconvergence for the morley element , which was postprocessed by projecting the finite element solution to another finite element space on a coarser mesh .",
    "see lin and lin @xcite for superconvergence of the ciarlet ",
    "raviart scheme of the biharmonic equation .",
    "note that all of those results are only for fourth order problems in two dimensions .",
    "superconvergence of nonconforming finite element methods can not be found for fourth order problems in three dimensions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to analyze superconvergence of both the two - dimensional and three - dimensional rectangular morley elements from @xcite .",
    "since both of them are nonconforming , one difficulty is to bound the consistency error .",
    "another difficulty is from the canonical interpolation operator which does not admit supercloseness . to overcome the first difficulty",
    ", we use some special orthogonal property of the canonical interpolation operators of both the bilinear and trilinear elements when applied to the functions in the rectangular morley element spaces .",
    "the other crucial observation is that the error between the ( piecewise ) gradient of functions in the discrete spaces and its mean is equal on two opposite edges ( faces ) of an element . in particular , this leads to superconvergence of second order for the consistency error . to deal with the second difficulty , we follow the idea from @xcite to use a correction of the canonical interpolation . together with the asymptotic expansion results from @xcite , this yields supercloseness of second order for such a corrected interpolation .",
    "finally , based on the above superconvergence results , we follow the postprocessing idea from @xcite to obtain a global superconvergent approximate solution , which converges at the second order convergence rate .",
    "it should be stressed that for first order nonconforming finite element methods of both two and three dimensional fourth order elliptic problems , it is the first time that full superconvergence of second order is obtained without an extra boundary condition imposed on exact solutions .",
    "it is also the first time that superconvergence is established for nonconforming finite element methods of three dimensional fourth order elliptic problems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", we shall present the model problem and the rectangular morley element . in section 3",
    ", we analyze the superconvergence property of the consistency error for the two - dimensional situation . in section 4",
    ", we make a correction of the canonical interpolation and obtain the superconvergence result after the postprocessing . in section 5",
    ", we establish the superconvergence result for the three - dimensional cubic morley element . in the last section 6",
    ", we present some numerical results to demonstrate our theoretical results .",
