    "@xcite and @xcite recently reported the discovery of two extreme halo stars , the red giant he0107@xmath05240 and the subgiant or dwarf he1327@xmath02326 , with an iron abundance more than 100000 times lower than the solar one . while the abundances of iron - peak elements in he0107@xmath05240 and he1327@xmath02326 are the lowest",
    "ever observed in stellar objects , these stars are also remarkable as that they show very large overabundances of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen with respect to iron . the lively interest aroused by he0107@xmath05240 and he1327@xmath02326 comes from the consideration that they could be directly related to the very first generation of metal - free ( population iii ) stars to form in the early universe .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin and chemical composition of these two stars .",
    "in particular the question has been raised whether he0107@xmath05240 and he1327@xmath02326 could actually be population iii stars or whether instead they were born from the ashes of a previous generation of metal - free stars .",
    "possible scenarios of the first kind include self - enrichment @xcite , accretion from the interstellar medium @xcite , or mass transfer from a close asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) companion star @xcite .",
    "however , these mechanisms have been shown to be unlikely or only partially satisfactory in reproducing the composition of both he0107@xmath05240 and he1327@xmath02326 ( see discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the two stars might have formed out of material polluted by just one single or a few first - generation stars .",
    "@xcite suggested that the chemical composition of he0107@xmath05240 might be naturally explained by the combined yields from a low mass ( @xmath3  m@xmath4 ) and a massive ( @xmath5  m@xmath4 ) supernova .",
    "@xcite proposed instead a scenario with a single @xmath625  m@xmath4 population iii star undergoing supernova explosion and experiencing mixing after the explosive nucleosynthesis and subsequent fallback on the compact remnant .",
    "@xcite argued that small variations in the explosion energy of this supernova model could in fact reproduce the chemical composition of both he0107@xmath05240 and he1327@xmath02326 .",
    "finally , @xcite recently showed that winds of rotating massive primordial stars might account for the c , n , and o excesses and possibly also for the na and al enhancements in these as well as in other extremely metal - poor stars .",
    "accurate determination of the chemical compositions of he0107@xmath05240 and he1327@xmath02326 is crucial for the identification of the most plausible formation scenarios for these stars .",
    "ordinary assumptions and approximations in classical stellar abundance analyses involve 1d , local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , hydrostatic model atmospheres relying on a simplified treatment of convective energy transport .",
    "however , recent 3d time - dependent simulations of stellar surface convection indicate that the structural differences between 3d hydrodynamical and 1d hydrostatic model stellar atmospheres have a significant impact on the predicted strength of spectral lines and hence on the derived abundances for stars with very low metallicity @xcite . here",
    "we present the results of an abundance analysis of he0107@xmath05240 and he1327@xmath02326 based on 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres .",
    "we use the 3d , time - dependent , radiative - hydrodynamical code by @xcite to carry out the first ever surface convection simulation of a metal - poor red giant star .",
    "the stellar parameters correspond to he0107@xmath05240 : t@xmath7  k , @xmath8  [ cgs ] , and a scaled solar composition @xcite with @xmath9}$]@xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the number densities of elements a and b respectively and subscript @xmath13 refers to the sun.]@xmath14 for all metals . as shown by @xcite , the thermal structure of a 1d model atmosphere with @xmath15}=-3 $ ] very closely resembles the one from a 1d model atmosphere tailored to the specific chemical composition of he0107@xmath05240 .",
    "this essentially reflects the dominating role of hydrogen both as opacity source as well as electron donor in metal - poor stellar atmospheres ; also , the too high iron - peak abundances are partly compensated by the too low cno abundances .",
    "we therefore expect our differential analysis to still provide a satisfactory estimate of 3d@xmath01d effects on spectral line formation in he0107@xmath05240 .",
    "the hydrodynamical equations of mass , momentum , and energy conservation are solved together with the 3d radiative transfer equation on a eulerian mesh with 100@xmath16100@xmath16125 grid - points .",
    "the physical domain of the simulation is large enough ( @xmath17  mm@xmath18 ) to cover about ten granules simultaneously and twelve pressure scales in the vertical direction . in terms of continuum",
    "optical depth at @xmath19   the simulation extends from @xmath20 down to @xmath21 .",
    "the temporal evolution of the simulation covers several convective turn - over time - scales to allow for thermal relaxation . for the simulations we employ open boundaries vertically and periodic boundaries horizontally . at each time - step the 3d radiative transfer equation is solved along one vertical and eight inclined rays .",
    "the opacities are grouped in four opacity bins @xcite and lte is assumed throughout the calculations .",
    "the adopted equation - of - state comes from @xcite and accounts for the effects of ionization , excitation and dissociation of 15 of the most abundant elements , as well as the h@xmath22 and h@xmath23 molecules .",
    "continuous opacities come from the uppsala opacity package ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and subsequent updates ) and line opacity data from @xcite .",
    "the thermal structure resulting from the convection simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ atmos1 ] together with the temperature stratification from a classical 1d , plane - parallel , hydrostatic marcs model atmosphere @xcite constructed for the same stellar parameters and chemical composition ( and a micro - turbulence of @xmath24kms@xmath25 ) .",
    "similarly to what was found by @xcite and @xcite for metal - poor dwarfs and subgiants , in the hydrodynamical simulation the temperature of the surface layers tends to remain much lower than in the 1d model atmosphere where radiative equilibrium is enforced .",
    "the temperature in the optically thin layers of the simulation is for the most part regulated by two competing mechanisms : adiabatic cooling following the expansion of the ascending gas and radiative heating by spectral lines . with fewer and weaker lines available at low metallicities , adiabatic",
    "cooling becomes more dominant and the balance between cooling and heating is reached at lower surface temperatures @xcite .",
    "we use the red giant convection simulation as a time - dependent 3d hydrodynamical model atmosphere to study detailed spectral line formation under the assumption of lte .",
    "while both our 3d hydrodynamical simulation and 1d marcs model atmosphere are constructed for a metallicity @xmath9}=-3 $ ] , in the line formation calculations we assume the chemical composition to be the same as for he0107@xmath05240 @xcite when computing ionization and molecular equilibria and continuous opacities .",
    "this is necessary since adopting a composition with metallicity @xmath9}=-3 $ ] would overestimate the abundance of elements with low ionization potentials ( e.g. na , ca , al ) and therefore the electron density , affecting ionization balance and , ultimately , line strengths .",
    "we also evaluate differential 3d@xmath01d effects in the hyper iron - poor star he1327@xmath02326 @xcite by adopting a previous 3d model @xcite of metal - poor turn - off star ( t@xmath26  k , @xmath27  [ cgs ] , and @xmath15}=-3 $ ] ) and the corresponding 1d marcs model atmosphere . while this @xmath28 is intermediate between the current best estimates for he1327@xmath02326 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 ,",
    "the derived abundances are only marginally sensitive to the choice of surface gravity in that range .",
    "furthermore , the 3d@xmath01d abundance corrections we compute are even less dependent on the exact value of @xmath28 . for the line formation calculations we assume the chemical composition of he1327@xmath02326 derived by @xcite . for the c , n , and o abundances we adopt values midway between the subgiant and dwarf solution .    from the full red giant and turn - off star simulations we select two representative sequences , respectively 8000 and 60 minutes long , of about 30 snapshots separated at regular intervals in time . prior to the line formation calculations we decrease the horizontal resolution from @xmath31 down to @xmath32 and increase the vertical resolution of the layers with @xmath33 to improve the numerical accuracy .",
    "we compute spectral line profiles for all lines from neutral and singly - ionized metals considered in the 1d analyses of @xcite and @xcite ( see also table  [ tabions ] ) .",
    "for each line we solve the radiative transfer equation along 33 directions ( 4 @xmath34-angles , 8 @xmath35-angles , and the vertical ) , after which we perform a disk - integration and a time - average over all selected snapshots . to estimate the impact of 3d models , we derive elemental abundances ( or their upper limits ) from the measured equivalent widths and carry out a differential comparison with the corresponding 1d marcs model atmospheres .",
    "we also consider a set of weak `` fictitious '' spectral lines representative of features in ch , c@xmath36 , cn , oh , and nh molecular bands @xcite with typical lower - level excitation potentials and @xmath37 values ( table  [ tabmol ] ) .",
    "we determine the 3d@xmath01d corrections to c , n , and o abundances by carrying out a similar comparison of equivalent widths for these lines with 3d and 1d models .",
    "while for the 1d analysis we adopt a micro - turbulence @xmath38kms@xmath25 for the red giant and @xmath39kms@xmath25 for the turn - off star , we emphasize that no micro- nor macro - turbulence parameters enter the 3d spectral line synthesis calculations : the velocity fields inherent to the hydrodynamical simulations are sufficient to reproduce the line broadening associated with convective doppler shifts @xcite .",
    "the 3d@xmath01d lte abundance corrections for atomic lines are presented in table  [ tabions ] and fig .",
    "[ xfe ] . lines of different species possess varying sensitivities to the temperature structure , therefore magnitudes and signs of the corrections depend on the considered transition . as 3d model",
    "metal - poor stellar atmospheres are significantly cooler at the surface than their 1d counterparts , the fraction of neutral - to - ionized metals is typically enhanced in the 3d simulations .",
    "consequently , for a given abundance , low - excitation lines of neutral minority species ( e.g.  ) appear stronger in the framework of 3d models than they do in 1d , resulting in negative 3d@xmath01d corrections . low - excitation lines of majority species also ( e.g.  the h&k lines , , , and transitions considered here ) have negative 3d@xmath01d abundance corrections : the effect in this case is not due to increased line opacities but rather to the decrease in continuous opacity associated with the lower density of @xmath40 ions in 3d model atmospheres of metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "high - excitation lines on the contrary , like the , , and features examined here , form in deeper photospheric layers and are essentially insensitive to the lower surface temperatures encountered in the 3d models .",
    "the resultant 3d@xmath01d abundance corrections for these lines are relatively small and mostly positive .    in table",
    "[ tabmol ] we present the relative 3d@xmath01d abundances of c , n , and o. molecule formation in late - type stars is highly sensitive to the temperature of the upper photospheric layers .",
    "the density of molecules is greatly enhanced in 3d models with respect to the 1d case , leading to large negative 3d@xmath01d lte abundance corrections .",
    "similarly as for neutral metals , these corrections are more pronounced the lower the excitation potential of the molecular line .",
    "overall we find for he1327@xmath02326 very large 3d@xmath01d corrections to the c , n , and o abundances that can reach @xmath41  dex for the lowest - excitation ch , nh , and oh lines .",
    "concerning he0107@xmath05240 , @xcite found a discrepancy of @xmath42  dex between the 1d lte carbon abundance values determined from ch and c@xmath36 molecular lines .",
    "our 3d analysis brings the c abundances derived from these two indicators down to a consistent level of @xmath43  dex . assuming the above value for the c abundance , we find substantial 3d@xmath01d corrections to the n abundance derived from cn lines ( @xmath44  dex or even larger ) .",
    "based on the recent identification of nh molecular bands in the uv spectrum of he0107@xmath05240 @xcite we compute 3d@xmath01d corrections to the n abundance derived from these lines and find them to be significantly smaller than for the cn features ( @xmath45  dex ) .",
    "the 3d n abundance derived for he0107@xmath05240 from cn lines is @xmath46  dex lower than the one inferred from nh lines ( table  [ tabmol ] ) .",
    "while the two indicators also yield discrepant n abundances in the 1d analysis , the agreement is significantly worse in 3d .",
    "however , the origin of this discrepancy is likely ascribable to inaccurate determination of the physical parameters of nh lines . @xcite and @xcite actually _ decreased _",
    "kurucz s @xmath37 values of these lines by @xmath47 dex upon calibration with the solar spectrum ; @xcite on the other hand observed in their analysis of extremely metal - poor giants that nh lines with kurucz s @xmath37 values give systematically ( @xmath48  dex ) _ higher _ n abundances than cn lines .",
    "the impact of 3d hydrodynamical models on the derived elemental abundances of extreme halo stars is of significance for our understanding of the early phases of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the most remarkable 3d@xmath01d lte effect on the abundance ratios ( fig .  [ xfe ] ) is a severe reduction of the c , n , and o enhancements in he0107@xmath05240 and he1327@xmath02326 .",
    "this result suggests that the cno yields of first generation stars might actually be systematically lower than previously thought .",
    "in particular the revised 3d abundances of carbon appear in closer agreement with the [ c / fe ] ratio predicted by @xcite with a stochastic galactic chemical evolution model even when relatively low c stellar yields @xcite are adopted .",
    "also , as rotating massive stars are believed to be the main contributors of primary nitrogen in the early galaxy , our downward revision of n abundance in hyper iron - poor stars can have strong implications for the modelling of the structure and evolution of primordial stars .",
    "overall , the lower cno enhancements resulting from the 3d analysis could be a challenge for the formation scenario proposed by @xcite given that the 3d@xmath01d effects on na , mg , and al are far less pronounced ( see discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to emphasize however that many of the lines considered in the analysis of he0107@xmath05240 and he1327@xmath02326 are expected to suffer from non - lte effects @xcite , given the steep temperature gradient in the atmospheric stratification and the weak uv line - blocking in these metal - poor stars .",
    "a complete 3d non - lte analysis of the two stars is beyond the scope of the present work ; however , we can to first approximation estimate non - lte effects on lines by means of a 1d analysis both with marcs models and mean atmospheric stratifications inferred from the 3d simulations . using the model fe atom by @xcite",
    "we find substantial non - lte corrections due to severe over - ionization feeding on the strong uv radiation field , even when fully efficient drawin - like @xcite inelastic h@xmath49fe collisions are taken into account : @xmath15_{non - lte}}\\simeq-4.7 $ ]  dex for he0107@xmath05240 and @xmath15_{non - lte}}\\simeq-5.1 $ ]  dex for he1327@xmath02326 these values are significantly larger than the ones reported by @xcite and @xcite , because of differences in the adopted efficiency of the h@xmath49fe collisions .",
    "the problem of non - lte line formation in hyper iron - poor stars certainly requires further investigation .",
    "we defer the study of non - lte effects on fe and other elements in 3d models to a future paper .",
