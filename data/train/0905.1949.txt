    "there are many reasons to believe that qcd has a dual description in terms of string theory .",
    "prominent among these , on the theoretical side , are the properties of qcd at large @xmath1 which include an infinite tower of mesons of arbitrarily high spin and a topological expansion which mimics that of string theory . on the experimental side ,",
    "the observed regge behavior of strong interaction processes at large center of mass energy @xmath2 and fixed momentum transfer @xmath3 is suggestive of string theory , and fits to total cross sections suggest a string description involving both reggeons ( open strings ) and a pomeron ( closed strings ) @xcite .",
    "there is persuasive new evidence for this duality , as well as a concrete prescription of how it should be implemented in the form of the string / gauge theory correspondence @xcite .",
    "although the full dual theory of qcd is not known , models which capture some of the central features of qcd have been developed .",
    "these theories include top - down models based on d - brane constructions @xcite , and bottom - up phenomenological models which incorporate the essential features of low - energy qcd into a dual description involving gauge theory in a five - dimensional space @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these models also have serious flaws @xcite .",
    "their development into more fully realistic dual theories requires testing their validity in a variety of settings .    of particular interest to us in this article",
    "are the chern - simons terms arising in the lagrangians of dual theories , which are determined by the anomaly structure of qcd .",
    "these give rise to pseudo - chern - simons couplings between the vector and axial - vector mesons of qcd , as well as more standard couplings appearing in gauged wzw terms .",
    "some consequences of such couplings were explored in @xcite .",
    "similar couplings also occur in the standard model , where the electroweak gauge bosons have pseudo - chern - simons couplings to qcd vector and axial - vector mesons when the wzw term is gauged in a way that includes the full gauge group and anomaly structure of the standard model @xcite . here",
    "we develop the calculations needed to compare the consequences of these couplings to the experimental data on photoproduction of vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "we note that although couplings of similar form can be written down on purely phenomenological grounds , the precise forms we get here are dictated by the general principles of ads / qcd and in particular by the demand that the anomalous variation of the dual theory correctly match the flavor anomalies of qcd .",
    "the high intensity electron beam at thomas jefferson national laboratory ( jlab ) and its large acceptance detector at hall d make possible a systematic study of vector and axial - vector meson photoproduction at intermediate photon energy @xmath4 and small momentum transfer ( forward angles ) .",
    "we focus on the region of small momentum transfer , where perturbative qcd is of little use and the exchange mechanism is dominated by the regge trajectories in the @xmath3-channel .",
    "we first consider single particle exchange , using the chern - simons term in holographic qcd to compute the anomalous couplings and vertex functions . keeping the single - particle vertex structure intact",
    ", we then replace the usual single - particle feynman propagator by the `` reggeized propagator , '' which includes contributions from the entire regge trajectory of the exchanged meson .",
    "especially relevant to jlab data is ( axial)vector - meson photoproduction from ( hydrogen ) nuclei , and we focus on this process here . though the vertices involving nucleons could also be studied in a holographic framework ( see e.g. @xcite ) , this lies outside the scope of the present work , and we instead take these vertices from other phenomenological models .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the two dual models of qcd which we will use to perform explicit calculations .",
    "the first is the bottom - up model introduced in @xcite following closely related models @xcite .",
    "the second is the top - down model of sakai and sugimoto @xcite . in section 3",
    "we discuss the anomalous couplings in these models and use them to derive a set of four - dimensional ( 4d ) couplings for pions , vector mesons and axial - vector mesons . in section 4",
    "we turn to calculations of photoproduction ( @xmath5 ) with a focus on photoproduction of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "this process provides a fairly clean test of the anomalous couplings , which predict a simple correlation between the polarization of the outgoing @xmath0 and the polarization of the incident photon .",
    "we first derive single particle exchange diagrams , then discuss their extension to exchange of full regge trajectories in order to describe the scattering in the regge regime . at the end of section 4 we outline other processes that may prove relevant in probing the structure of the @xmath0 regge trajectory . in the final section we conclude and suggest extensions of the current work . in the three appendices we give a more detailed list of various pseudo - chern - simons couplings ( appendix a ) , a brief analysis of the contribution of nucleon exchange to @xmath0 photoproduction ( appendix b ) , and a comparison of the decay @xmath6 using our results to the experimentally measured rate and polarization structure .",
    "in this section we review the general features of the ads / qcd construction and the structure of two proposed qcd duals .",
    "this will serve mainly to fix our notation and conventions ; additional details may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "ads / qcd models tweak the original ads / cft duality between @xmath7 and string theory on @xmath8 to yield a conjectured equivalence between four - dimensional ( 4d ) strongly coupled qcd at large @xmath1 and a 5d weakly interacting gauge theory coupled to gravity on a space @xmath9 .",
