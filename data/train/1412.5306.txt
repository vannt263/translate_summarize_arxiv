    "the errors in the phases are about 0.01 , with all errors being determined over four consecutive periods .",

    "this difficulty is further highlighted by the fact that the maximum horizontal temperature variation and convective velocity are generally higher in the 3d models nearer to the red edge .",

    "6600  k ) agree quite well for the 2d and 3d calculations . for the models near both edges of the fundamental mode instability strip and for the first overtone model calculated , the 3d pulsation amplitudes are noticeably lower than those of the 2d models . before discussing these differences in amplitude in detail",
    ", we turn to a comparison of the individual light curves .",
    "we have previously shown a comparison between the 2d and 3d light curves for @xmath57  k ( gd3 ) .",
    "the differences in the computed light curves are very similar to the result for @xmath58  k , shown in figure  [ f2 ] : the 2d and 3d curves are essentially the same during rising light , but the 3d curve falls off more rapidly from peak light and then falls more slowly as minimum light is approached . in the 6500k case we noted that the 2d light curve resembles the observed light curves more closely during decreasing light .",
    "this is also true for the 6600  k case as well , as the comparison with the light curve of v10 in m3 @xcite shows .",
    "comparisons of the 2d light curves with observations are presented in gd2 .",
    "the same trend is also true for the @xmath59  k model , although the difference in amplitude between the 2d and 3d calculations somewhat masks the effect .",
    "we show this in figure  [ f3 ] , along with the light curve of v120 .",
    "again , the 2d light curve provides marginally better agreement with the observations than the 3d light curve .",
    "one should keep in mind that some details of the light curves change as the amplitude changes .",
    "a somewhat different picture is presented in figure  [ f4 ] for the @xmath60  k case . here",
    "the 3d light curve falls more slowly from maximum light than the 2d light curve , and the two curves have nearly the same slope in the latter half of decreasing light until minimum light is approached .",
    "there is little discernible difference during rising light except near maximum light , which may be attributed to the lower amplitude of the 3d calculation .",
    "the comparison with the low amplitude first overtone pulsation v97 shows that the 3d calculation has a steeper rise to maximum light and remains at maximum light for a shorter time .",
    "the 2d light curve comparison with v125 shows the same trend ( figure 13 of gd2 ) , but perhaps in a less pronounced way .",
    "we should also note that the difference in total amplitude may play a role in the apparent differences of the light curve shape as some features of the light curves shape can change with amplitude .",
    "thus , there are some general differences between the light curves of the 2d and 3d calculations which appear to occur over most of the instability strip .",
    "we now examine possible sources , both numerical and physical , for the differences .",

    "the pulsation amplitude for the @xmath76  k 3d model is somewhat less than that for the 2d model .",
    "part of this is due to the fact that the 3d model has a very low growth rate and may not have reached full amplitude even after extensive time integration , although we doubt that it would reach the 2d amplitude based on this current rate of growth .",
    "the 2d models near the red edge have a tendency to form deeper convection zones .",
    "our experiments with the 2d angular zoning in section 4 indicate that this tendency depends on the angular zoning , being less likely as the angular resolution or angular extent is increased . forming a deep convection zone",
    "means that reaching the full amplitude solution may take some time because of the changing thermal energy content of the outer parts of the model .",
    "this may not be reflected in the amplitude of the light curve or the magnitude of the peak kinetic energy per period except over many pulsation cycles .",
    "the full amplitude should thus be considered more uncertain and sensitive near the red edge .",
    "looking at the first overtone model , we note that the 2d first overtone calculation was actually begun in the fundamental and made the transition to the first overtone during the hydrodynamic simulation while the 3d calculation was begun in the first overtone .",
    "furthermore , there is a few hundredths of a magnitude variation in the amplitude over the course of a number of periods in the 2d light curve , suggesting that some fundamental mode contamination remains . to make a better comparison , we recomputed the 2d calculation imposing the first overtone velocity distribution instead of the fundamental mode velocity distribution on the static model .",
    "the result is that the 2d amplitude is reduced from about 0.50 mag to 0.46 mag , but still noticeably higher than the 3d 0.38 mag .",
    "this suggests a genuine difference ( see figure  [ f4 ] ) .",
    "one can see that the two light curves have nearly the same shape ; it is just the amplitude which is different .    to explore the nature of this difference in amplitude we have considered the following possibilities",
    ": it is a physical difference related to how convection alters pulsation in 2d and 3d , it is related to how large eddy simulations differ in 2d and 3d , and it is a numerical effect perhaps related to the different zonings in 2d and 3d .",
    "for the first of these we will examine the relationship between the light and velocity curves and the time dependent convective behaviour on pulsation phase .",
    "the second we investigate by examining the effects of eddy viscosity coefficient variation in 2d and 3d .",
    "finally we study the effects of angular zoning in 2d calculations .    to explore",
    "if the differences in amplitude are physical in origin we compared the surface pulsational velocities of the two models and found the amplitudes to be quite close , to within about 1 km s@xmath77 out of a total amplitude of approximately 55 km s@xmath77 .",
    "this suggests a difference between the 2d and 3d models that alters the relationship between light and velocity amplitudes a modest amount . in both models",
    "the convective flux is always small , as seen in the time dependent history of the maximum ratio of the convective to total luminosity shown in figure  [ f5 ] .",
    "we see that the time dependence is similar for both 2d and 3d , with the primary difference between the two being the larger ratio of the convective luminosity to the total luminosity in 2d just prior to the time of maximum contraction velocity ( approximately phases 0.4 to 0.6 in figure  [ f5 ] ) . at this time there appears to be a little more mass in the hydrogen and first helium ionization zones in 2d than in 3d , which may produce a larger amount of driving in 2d than 3d , although the discrete nature of the zoning and the defining of the boundaries of the ionization region makes this conclusion somewhat less than compelling .",
    "the other difference of note is that the velocity at the second local maximum near the end of contraction is closer to zero in 2d than in 3d ( approximately phase 0.75 ) when the large spike in convective luminosity is seen in both 2d and 3d .",
    "it is not clear how this relates to the difference in light amplitude if at all .",
    "we previously found that increasing the free constant in the eddy viscosity coefficient by a factor of two decreased the amplitude of the light curve by about 10% .",
    "we have performed similar calculations with both a 2d and 3d model and achieved a similar rate of change for both , matching our previous result , although there are some exceptions .",
    "in addition to the free constant the eddy viscosity coefficient depends on a characteristic length scale which is equated with the grid zoning ( see equation  15 of gd2 ) . in 2d",
    "we have taken this length scale to be the square root of the product of the zone sizes in the two directions . in 3d",
    "it is the cube root of the product of the zone sizes in the three directions .",
    "because the radial zoning is generally finer than the angular zoning , the characteristic length scale tends to be slightly larger in 3d than in 2d .",
    "this operates in the direction of making the 3d light curve amplitude smaller than it would be if we used the 2d characteristic length scale . while this is not sufficiently large to explain the difference for the 6900  k model , it may be compounded by the fact that the larger amplitude variation will compress the radial zoning further , making the eddy viscosity even less .",
    "we summarize these results in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "the table includes the value of the eddy viscosity parameter ( 0.17 ) used in all our other calculations .",
    "we see that velocity amplitude increases as we increase the eddy viscosity coefficient in both 2d and 3d ( indeed , the velocity amplitude appears to be the same in 2d and 3d ) .",
    "however , the light amplitude decreases in the 3d case , while it is basically the same in the 2d case .",
    "this suggests that the light amplitude is a fairly sensitive feature in the calculations .",
    "possibly a very broad parameter study , beyond the range of this current work , may be required to resolve this .",
    "while these differences in the light curves are noticeable , it might be regarded as more surprising that they are not larger than they are , given that the 2d convective flow patterns are different from the 3d patterns .",
    "the primary difference is that in 2d the downward flow is in a trench rather than the relatively narrow column in 3d .",
    "this difference makes it somewhat difficult to compare 2d convection results such as the convective flux with the 3d analogue ( see discussion in gd3 ) .",
    "another way to change the characteristic length scale is to change the grid zone size in the calculation .",
    "while extensive calculations in 3d are computationally prohibitive , we can perform some in 2d and present the results in the next section .",

    "however , until now we have not examined the angular zoning .",
    "the long time to completion makes this impractical for 3d calculations , so we focus on the latitudinal zoning for our 2d calculations . to this end",
    "we have performed a set of three new full amplitude calculations for @xmath88  k with different angular zonings for comparison with the baseline calculations above : 1 ) calculation with the same horizontal extent but twice the angular resolution ( case a ) , 2 ) calculation with twice the horizontal extent but the same angular resolution ( case b ) , 3 ) calculation with twice the horizontal extent and twice the angular resolution ( case c ) .",
    "the same properties as in table  [ t1 ] are summarized in table  [ t3 ] for the baseline case and these three angular zoning variations .",
    "we see that both light and velocity amplitudes generally increase as the resolution gets better and the extent gets larger .",
    "the horizontal temperature amplitude and phase do not appear to be much affected , while the convective velocities appear larger in the wider extent calculations .",
    "visual inspection of the convective flow patterns of the baseline calculation compared to cases a , b , and c show that the larger extent cases ( b and c ) contain two convective cells , while the smaller extant cases ( baseline and a ) contain only one convective cell .",
    "the appearance of the large scale flow patterns remain the same between the baseline case and case a and between the larger extent calculation cases ( b and c ) , in that a convective cell is composed of one fast narrow down - flow and a slow broad up - flow ( an example of such a flow is given in figures  1 and 2 in gd3 ) ; there is little difference in the large scale structure of the convective flow patterns from lower resolution to higher resolution .    the comparison between light curves of the baseline calculation and cases a , b and c are presented in figure  [ f6 ] .",
    "we see that the shape of the light curve is not very different although the amplitude is approximately 0.2 mag larger for the higher resolution case ( case a ) .",
    "perhaps this should be expected because higher angular resolution makes the eddy length scale smaller , and we have already shown that reducing the eddy viscosity coefficient increases the amplitude ( see discussion above ) .    the shape of the light curve does change in case b , particularly near minimum light .",
    "the prominent stand still in the baseline case at about phase 0.6 has been almost eliminated .",
    "again the pulsation amplitude is increased with respect to the baseline case , but only by about 0.1 mag .",
    "the amplitude of the light curve in case c is larger than either case a or case b , perhaps suggesting an additive effect .",
    "the primary difference to the shape of the light curve is the loss of the long stand still at minimum light , seen in both case a and the baseline case , but with a remnant of a stand still prior to the final dip to minimum light which might be seen as a composite of case a and case b. the near stand still during falling light near mean light present in the baseline case and in case b and less prominently in case a is virtually absent in case c. however , we have noticed that a number of detailed features such as this in light curves are amplitude dependent so that ascribing it to a particular resolution must be treated with caution .",
    "we compare the light curves of case c and v65 in figure  [ f7 ] were it is clear that they have features in common , such as the large dip at minimum light and the near stand still before that dip .",
    "however , we note that the model at a given phase during declining light is always less luminous . despite the difference in amplitude",
    ", we find that the pulsational growth rates are essentially the same for all four cases .    we have computed full amplitude solutions for case c for effective temperatures from 6300 - 6900 k for comparison with the baseline case .",
    "as the effective temperature increases the change in amplitude between the baseline case and case c decreases from about 0.3 mag for @xmath88  k to about 0.1 mag for @xmath89  k. the change is only about 0.05 mag for the first overtone @xmath60  k case ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "this decrease in effect with increasing effective temperature is most likely due to decreasing importance of convection .",
    "based on all these results , it would appear that the amplitude and some aspects of the shape of the light curve are relatively sensitive to the various numerical aspects of the model .",
    "this should not disguise the fact that the time dependent interaction between convection and pulsation is clear in general with only relatively minor differences in detail .",
    "over the past three years we developed a code capable of simulating the effects of convection on pulsation in rr lyrae stars . the code can be run in one , two , or three dimensions .",
    "a key to allowing us to compute full amplitude rr lyrae models is forcing the radial zoning to move in such a way that the mass in any given spherical shell is constant throughout the evolution .",
    "this does not mean that the flow is lagrangian , although it is in one dimension , but that there is no net flow of mass in or out of a spherical shell during the calculation .",
    "the convective flow patterns are of course different in 2d and 3d , but the dependence of the convective flux on pulsation phase is quite similar .",
    "this suggests that 2d calculations are not a bad surrogate for 3d calculations , a point emphasized by the slight differences in pulsational growth rates .",
    "the light curves are reasonable representations of those observed , and those near the red edge are quite a bit better than calculated with 1d models using a time dependent mixing length theory .",
    "this does not mean that all issues are resolved .",
    "there are differences between the light curves in the 2d and 3d calculations of the same rr lyrae model , and the amplitude of the pulsation is rather sensitive to parameters of the eddy viscosity treatment , particularly the eddy viscosity coefficient and the characteristic length scale ( here assumed to be related to the size of the computational mesh ) . at least part of this sensitivity probably arises from the fact that the zoning is still too coarse for the turbulent cascade to extend to sufficiently small scales .",
    "it is interesting that the 2d light curves generally look more like the observed light curves than the 3d light curves .",
    "we have presented some zoning studies in 2d that suggest that finer zoning is needed in the angular directions . because it takes several tens of millions of time steps to compute a full amplitude model , even with a sizeable initial pulsational velocity , the likelihood of being able to compute models with significantly better angular zoning in 3d is remote , although it would be feasible to double our angular zoning again ( to 160 zones ) for a limited number of models in 2d .",
    "another generation or two of computing power will probably allow more finely resolved 3d calculations to be made , although they will still be time consuming for the foreseeable future .",
    "many of these calculations would not have been possible without the support of compute canada , and particularly of acenet , the high performance computing provider in atlantic canada .",
