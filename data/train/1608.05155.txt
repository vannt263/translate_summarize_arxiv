    "random numbers are an important resource for several applications in science and engineering , as in the monte - carlo modeling method @xcite and cryptography @xcite , and also for daily applications , as lotteries and gambling .",
    "random number generators ( rngs ) based on a deterministic process , usually an algorithm , generates a sequence that appears to be random at a first glance  in the sense of uniformly distributed statistics  but , in spite of being successfully employed in simulation tools @xcite , each generated bit is predictable in principle .",
    "this is a drawback that makes this kind of rng inappropriate for some sensitive applications , as in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) .",
    "quantum random number generators ( qrngs ) , on the other hand , are based on intrinsically random quantum mechanical processes and , hence , are considered truly random devices @xcite .",
    "a very elegant implementation for a qrng is the path - splitting of photons in a beam splitter ( bs ) @xcite and in fact constitutes the operational principle of popular commercially available devices @xcite .",
    "a single photon impinging on a symmetrical bs has identical probabilities of emerging at either of its output modes  the state is thus in a superposition of both spatial modes .",
    "if one places one detector at each output of the bs , bits `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' can be assigned to a valid detection on either side .",
    "faint optical sources are usual in these generators due to their simplicity and efficacy , but the emission of multiple photons limits the maximum probability of generating a random bit because it leads to collisions  coincidence events between the detectors  that are neither assigned as `` 0 '' nor `` 1 '' and thus discarded . an optimum operation point is thus obtained from the trade - off of avoiding multi - photon states while reducing the vacuum component .",
    "photon sources based on spontaneous parametric down - conversion could be used to reduce the collision probability by avoiding multi - photon emission in a sub - poisson emission regime @xcite or by producing path entangled photons @xcite .",
    "this kind of source , however , has low brightness and is significantly more complex to implement than faint sources .    in this paper",
    "we present a technique for enhancing a qrng based on randomly populating the output spatial modes of a beam splitter by feeding it with indistinguishable mutually - incoherent weak coherent states ( wcss ) . the interference phenomenon ( @xcite , and references therein ) plays the role of reducing the probability of occurrence of a collision .",
    "this simple modification from the traditional splitting of a single wcs enhances the probability of generating a valid random bit .",
    "we experimentally validate the theoretical model and successfully assess the generated bit sequence using standard randomness tests , proving our proposal to be an attractive approach for a practical qrng .",
    "in a standard path  splitting qrng , photons are sent into a symmetric beam splitter ( bs@xmath0 ) and a valid bit is assigned whenever only one of the two single - photon detectors ( spds )  each placed at one of the output modes  clicks . when dealing with states with more than one photon at the input of the bs  as in the case of wcss weak coherent states ",
    "the coincident counts between the detectors limit the maximum generation probability of the qrng , as collision events are discarded .",
    "feeding the bs with coherent state and vacuum at the input modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 results in coherent states at the output modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 : @xmath5 ; each photon entering the beam splitter takes a random , independent output .",
    "the probability of simultaneously finding @xmath6 and @xmath7 photons at spatial modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 thus follows the poisson distribution @xcite .",
    "our proposal is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "two - photon interference takes a major role in our proposed scheme since the source of randomness is not only the indivisibility of the light quanta , but the bosonic nature of the photons : two indistinguishable photons that impinge on a bs emerge bunched together in a _",
    "random _ output mode @xcite .",
    "this means the output state is in a superposition of both modes : @xmath8 .",
    "two indistinguishable wcss @xmath9 at the input modes of the beam splitter , with uniformly distributed random phases @xmath10 and equal amplitudes @xmath11 , are described by the density operator    @xmath12^{\\otimes 2 } \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the average number of photons per time interval . by indistinguishable states we mean the polarization , spatial and temporal modes are matched and they have identical values of @xmath13 .",
    "this state can be decomposed into pairs of fock states @xmath14 , where the probability of occurring @xmath6 photons in mode @xmath1 and @xmath7 photons in mode @xmath2 follows the poisson distribution    @xmath15    each input state @xmath14 results in the output given by @xcite    @xmath16    the probability of simultaneously finding @xmath17 photons at mode @xmath3 and @xmath18 photons at mode @xmath4 is obtained by summing over the projections of the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) weighted by the probability of each input to occur :    @xmath19    the maximum contrast of the coincidence counts between modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 is limited to 0.5 in the case of indistinguishable wcss as inputs due to the finite probability of occurring multi - photon events at the inputs @xcite .    for perfect single - photon detectors , any non - vacuum number state reaching the device originates a detection event .",
    "in practice , however , there is a finite probability of detection of photons at modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 : an @xmath20-photon state is detected by a ( threshold ) spd of overall efficiency @xmath21 with probability @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this is applied to each output mode , according to the number of photons .",
    "the probability of generating a valid bit , @xmath23 , is therefore computed from the events with any number of photons being counted in only one mode .",
    "the probability of an event being discarded due to the simultaneous detection at both output modes , @xmath24 , represents a collision .",
    "this is computed , neglecting the spds dark counts , as    @xmath25    the throughput of the generator using continuous - wave light is obtained by multiplying the probability of generating a valid bit by the detection gate frequency .",
    "the continuous - wave emission of a telecom dfb laser source at 1547.8 nm is split into two branches by an optical beam splitter ( @xmath26 ) , as shown in the detail of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the signals are decorrelated from each other by an 8-km long optical fiber spool ( this spool was chosen to be much longer than the mutual coherence length of the sources , measured as 5.2 m ) and sent to bs@xmath0 as two mutually - incoherent independent sources .",
    "the two states are power balanced  resulting in identical values of @xmath13  and their polarization modes , overlapped .",
    "the average number of photons per time interval of both states is simultaneously adjusted by the variable optical attenuator ( voa ) placed right after the laser source .",
    "the all - fiber setup guarantees the spatial modes overlap .",
    "the output modes of bs@xmath27 are connected to an ingaas / inp avalanche photodiode - based spd .",
    "the detectors operate in gated geiger mode and are synchronously triggered by a periodic 100 khz clock signal . at each trigger pulse , the detectors open a 1.6-ns wide temporal gate window with 15% detection efficiency .",
    "afterpulses are avoided by the low gate frequency @xcite , but an aftercount deadtime can be employed if higher rate is desired with this kind of detector .",
    "maximum interference between the wcss is ensured with matched states and verified at low @xmath13 by scanning the relative delay between the detection gates of the spds , resulting in about 49% visibility .",
    "the detection pulses generated by detectors spd@xmath28 and spd@xmath0 are sent to the processing unit ( pu ) , composed by a two - channel 100 msamples / s acquisition board driven by a personal computer .",
    "both channels are simultaneously sampled , fetched and processed in blocks .",
    "if a detection pulse is sampled at only one channel , this is treated as a valid bit , 0 and 1 associated to each channel . whenever an event occurs at both channels simultaneously ,",
    "it is considered a collision and is discarded .",
    "a predefined temporal matching window is used to account for an eventual offset delay between both channels .",
    "the qrng runs until the desired number of bits is obtained .",
    "the attenuation set at the voa is varied and the statistics of events is obtained using indistinguishable wcss . the experiment is repeated with a single wcs by connecting the faint laser source to one input port of the main beam splitter with vacuum at the other .",
    "the probability of our proposed qrng to generate a valid output bit or to discard the collision event was numerically simulated . for practical purposes ,",
    "the probability to generate or discard of bits when using a detector with overall detection efficiency @xmath291 can be computed by replacing @xmath13 for @xmath30 .",
    "different values of @xmath30 at the input modes of the beam splitter ( bs@xmath0 at fig .",
    "@xmath31 ) were employed using eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "the case of a single wcs plus vacuum is used as a benchmark for evaluating the improvement offered by our proposal on the bit generation probability .",
    "the probability of simultaneously finding @xmath17 and @xmath18 photons at the output of the bs in this case is directly obtained from the poisson distribution @xcite @xmath32 . the maximum number of photons used for the expansion of the wcss keeps the cumulative distribution function of the poisson distribution greater than 99.9% .    the results , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , reveal that the maximum probability of generating a valid random bit per detection gate can be enhanced when two indistinguishable wcss are used .",

    "the number of events occurring at only one channel and also events simultaneously taken at both detectors were counted .",
    "the intrinsic decay in the visibility of the interference with the increase of @xmath30 , as the multi - photon states become more probable , is accounted for by the model and naturally embedded in the experimental results .",

    "see @xcite  would reduce the gain of our qrng over the path - splitting - only method , which tends to zero with fully - distinguishable states .",

    "both channels register events with high probability and the number of coincidences naturally increases . with indistinguishable wcss",
    "this increase builds up at at higher values of @xmath30 due to the two - photon interference effect .",
