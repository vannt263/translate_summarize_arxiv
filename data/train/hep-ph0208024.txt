    "later cowsik and mcclelland  @xcite speculated that massive neutrinos could actually provide the dark matter in clusters of galaxies .",
    "however , it soon became clear that neutrinos were not a good dark matter candidate for two reasons .",
    "one is the limited phase space for neutrinos gravitationally bound to a galaxy  @xcite .",
    "therefore , galactic dark - matter neutrinos must obey a _",
    "lower _ mass limit of some 30  ev for typical spirals , and even 100200  ev for dwarf galaxies ( `` tremaine - gunn - limit '' ) .",
    "today the most restrictive laboratory limits on the overall neutrino mass scale come from the mainz  @xcite and troitsk  @xcite tritium experiments .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : tritiumlimits ] ) is so restrictive that neutrinos as galactic dark matter are completely ruled out .",
    "secondly , cosmic structure formation provides powerful information on the neutrino mass fraction @xmath14 . the observed structure in the distribution of galaxies is thought to arise from the gravitational instability of primordial density fluctuations .",
    "the small masses of neutrinos imply that they stay relativistic for a long time after their decoupling ( `` hot dark matter '' ) , allowing them to stream freely , thereby erasing the primordial density fluctuations on small scales @xcite .",
    "while this effect does not preclude neutrino dark matter , it implies a top - down scenario for structure formation where large structures form first , later fragmenting into smaller ones .",
    "it was soon realized that the predicted properties of the large - scale matter distribution did not agree with observations  @xcite .    today",
    "it is widely accepted that the universe has critical density and that its mass - energy inventory sports several nontrivial components .",
    "besides some 5% baryonic matter ( most of it dark ) there are some 25% cold dark matter in an unidentified physical form and some 70% of a negative - pressure component ( `` dark energy '' ) . and",
    "because neutrinos do have mass , they contribute at least 0.1% .",
    "this fraction is based on @xmath15 , the smallest value consistent with atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",

    "this limit corresponds approximately to the dot - dashed ( @xmath22 ) curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "neutrinos may still contribute as much as 5% of the critical density , about as much as baryons .",
    "to    within the standard theory of structure formation , the largest systematic uncertainty comes from the unknown biasing parameter @xmath23 that relates the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution to the underlying matter distribution , @xmath24 .",
    "the biasing parameter is one of the quantities which must be taken into account when fitting all large - scale structure data to observations of the galaxy distribution and of the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation . in the future",
    "the sloan digital sky survey will have greater sensitivity to the overall shape of @xmath25 on the relevant scales , allowing one to disentangle more reliably the impact of @xmath23 and @xmath26 on @xmath16 .",
    "it is foreseen that one can then reach a sensitivity of @xmath27 @xcite .    for degenerate neutrino masses eq .",
    "( [ eq : cosmicmasslimit ] ) corresponds to a limit on the overall mass scale of @xmath28 , more restrictive than the laboratory limit eq .",
    "( [ eq : tritiumlimits ] ) .",
    "however , the katrin project for improving the tritium endpoint sensitivity is foreseen to reach 0.3  ev @xcite , similar to the anticipated sensitivity of future cosmological observations .",
    "if both methods yield a positive signature , they will mutually re - enforce each other .",
    "if they both find upper limits , again they will be able to cross - check each other s constraints .",
    "the laboratory limits or future measurements of @xmath2 and of a hot dark matter component can be related to each other if the cosmic neutrino density @xmath29 is known .",

    "the structure - formation limits on the hot dark matter fraction provide a conservative limit on @xmath2 .",
    "conversely , a laboratory limit on @xmath2 does not limit the hot dark matter fraction .",
    "big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is affected by @xmath36 in that a larger neutrino density increases the primordial expansion rate , thereby increasing the neutron - to - proton freeze - out ratio @xmath37 and thus the cosmic helium abundance .",
    "therefore , the observed primordial helium abundance provides a limit on @xmath36 which corresponds to some fraction of one effective extra neutrino species .",
    "in addition , an electron neutrino chemical potential modifies @xmath38 . depending on the sign of @xmath39 this effect can increase or decrease the helium abundance and",
    "can compensate for the effect of other flavors @xcite .",
    "if @xmath39 is the only chemical potential , bbn provides the limit @xmath40 including the compensation effect , the only upper limit on the radiation density comes from precision measurements of the power spectrum of the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and from large - scale structure measurements . a recent analysis yields the allowed regions @xcite @xmath41 in agreement with similar results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the neutrino oscillations imply that the individual flavor lepton numbers are not conserved and that in full thermal equilibrium all neutrinos are characterized by one single chemical potential @xmath34 .",
    "if flavor equilibrium is achieved before @xmath37 freeze - out , the restrictive bbn limit on @xmath39 applies to all flavors , i.e.  @xmath42 , implying that the cosmic number density of neutrinos is fixed to within about 1% . in that case",
    "the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath2 is uniquely given by the standard expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : oega_nu ] ) .",
    "the approach to flavor equilibrium in the early universe by neutrino oscillations and collisions was recently studied  @xcite . assuming the atmospheric and solar lma solutions , an example for the cosmic flavor evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the detailed treatment is complicated and involves subtleties related to the large weak potential caused by the neutrinos themselves .",
    "the intriguing phenomenon of synchronized flavor oscillations  @xcite plays an interesting role , that coincidentally could also be important in the context of supernova neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "to    the practical bottom line , however , is rather simple .",
    "effective flavor equilibrium before @xmath37 freeze - out is reliably achieved if the solar oscillation parameters are in the favored lma region . in the low region ,",
    "the result depends on the value of the small but unknown third mixing angle @xmath43 . in the sma and vac regions , which are now heavily disfavored ,",
    "equilibrium is not achieved . establishing lma as the correct solution of the solar neutrino problem , for example by the kamland reactor experiment @xcite , amounts in our context to counting the number of cosmological neutrinos and thus to establishing a unique relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath14 .",
    "neutrino masses in the sub - ev range can play an interesting albeit indirect role for creating the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) in the framework of leptogenesis scenarios @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients are those of the usual see - saw mechanism for small neutrino masses . restricting ourselves to a single family ,",
    "the relevant parameters are the heavy majorana mass @xmath44 of the ordinary neutrino s right - handed partner and a yukawa coupling @xmath45 between the neutrinos and the higgs field @xmath46 .",
    "the observed neutrino then has a majorana mass @xmath47 that can be very small if @xmath44 is large , even if the yukawa coupling @xmath45 is comparable to that for other fermions . here , @xmath48 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field which also gives masses to the other fermions .",
    "the heavy majorana neutrinos will be in thermal equilibrium in the early universe .",
    "when the temperature falls below their mass , their density is boltzmann suppressed . however ,",
    "if at that time they are no longer in thermal equilibrium , their abundance will exceed the equilibrium distribution .",
    "the subsequent out - of - equilibrium decays can lead to the net generation of lepton number .",
    "cp - violating decays are possible by the usual interference of tree - level with one - loop diagrams with suitably adjusted phases of the various couplings . the generated lepton number excess will be re - processed by standard - model sphaleron effects which respect @xmath49 but violate @xmath50 .",
    "it is straightforward to generate the observed bau by this mechanism .",
    "the requirement that the heavy majorana neutrinos freeze out before they get boltzmann suppressed implies an upper limit on the combination of parameters @xmath51 that also appears in the see - saw formula for @xmath2 .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium condition thus implies an upper limit on @xmath2 .",
    "detailed scenarios for generic neutrino mass and mixing schemes have been worked out , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review and citations of the large body of pertinent literature .",
    "the bottom line is that neutrino mass and mixing schemes suggested by the atmospheric and solar oscillation data are nicely consistent with plausible leptogenesis scenarios .",
    "of course , it is an open question of how one would go about to verify or falsify leptogenesis as the correct baryogenesis mechanism .",
    "still , it is intriguing that massive neutrinos may have a lot more to do with the baryons than with the dark matter of the universe !",
    "a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) is perhaps the only system besides the early universe that is dynamically dominated by neutrinos . moreover , stellar collapse neutrinos have been observed once from sn  1987a and may be observed again from a future galactic sn .",
    "a core - collapse sn marks the evolutionary end of a massive star ( @xmath52 ) that has reached the usual onion structure with several burning shells , an expanded envelope , and a degenerate iron core .",
    "the core mass grows by nuclear burning at its edge until it reaches the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "the collapse can not ignite nuclear fusion because iron is the most tightly bound nucleus .",
    "therefore , the collapse continues until the equation of state stiffens at about nuclear density ( @xmath53 ) . at this `` bounce '' a shock wave forms , moving outward and expelling the stellar mantle and envelope , i.e.  the explosion is a reversed implosion . within the expanding nebula ,",
    "a compact object remains in the form of a neutron star or perhaps sometimes a black hole .",
    "the kinetic energy of the explosion carries about 1% of the liberated gravitational binding energy of about @xmath54 , the remaining 99% going into neutrinos .",
    "the main phases of this sequence of events are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .    to    the bounce - and - shock explosion mechanism  @xcite is essentially a hydrodynamical phenomenon .",
    "however , realistic numerical simulations have difficulties exploding for a physical reason .",
    "the shock wave forms _ within _ the iron core .",
    "as it moves outward it dissipates energy by the dissociation of iron .",
    "the nuclear binding energy of @xmath55 iron is about @xmath56 and thus comparable to the explosion energy .",
    "therefore , the shock wave stalls without driving off the stellar mantle and envelope .",
    "the standard scenario holds that the stagnating shock is `` re - juvenated '' by energy deposition so that enough pressure builds up behind the shock to set it back into motion .",
    "this `` delayed explosion scenario '' was first proposed in the early 1980s by bethe and wilson  @xcite .",
    "one source of energy deposition behind the shock wave is energy absorption from the nearly freely streaming neutrinos which originate from the neutrino sphere near the neutron - star surface",
    ". continued mass accretion and convection below the shock wave also deposit energy and thus contribute to the shock revival .",
    "the main recent progress in numerical sn calculation has been the implementation of efficient boltzmann solvers so that a realistic neutrino transport scheme can be self - consistently coupled with the hydrodynamical evolution  @xcite .",
    "such state - of - the - art spherically symmetric calculations do not lead to successful explosions .",
    "( the livermore group does obtain robust explosions  @xcite . in their spherically symmetric calculations",
    "they include a mixing - length treatment of `` neutron finger convection , '' thereby enhancing the early neutrino luminosity and thus the energy deposition behind the shock  @xcite .",
    "their results agree with the findings of other groups that diffusive neutrino transport alone is not enough to trigger the explosion . )",
    "the spherically symmetric calculations are not self - consistent in that the regions below the shock wave are convectively unstable .",
    "forthcoming calculations will reveal if convection , perhaps coupled with more accurate neutrino interaction rates , will lead to successful explosions .",
    "the expected neutrino fluxes and spectra are illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the @xmath57 lightcurve shows a conspicuous spike early on , representing the prompt neutrino burst which occurs when the shock wave reaches the region of neutrino trapping in the iron core .",
    "the dissociation of iron allows for the quick neutronization of a layer of the proto neutron star .",
    "of course , most of the lepton number remains trapped and slowly escapes by neutrino diffusion .",
    "the subsequent broad shoulder up to about 300  ms , best visible in the right panel with linear scales , represents the accretion phase where material keeps falling in and powers the neutrino emission .",
    "after this phase the shock wave has driven off the stellar mantle .",
    "the subsequent long and flat tail represents the neutron star cooling by neutrino emission .",
    "the duration of the accretion phase depends on how long it takes to revive the shock wave . in the absence of a confirmed robust explosion mechanism the exact duration of the accretion phase",
    "is not known .",
    "moreover , it may well depend on details of the star , e.g.  on the progenitor mass .    to    in order to observe effects of neutrino oscillations , the fluxes and/or spectra must be different between the different flavors . in the simulation of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] the neutrino luminosity is virtually equipartitioned among the flavors after about 100  ms . in the recent oakridge simulation @xcite , which includes a state - of - the - art boltzmann solver ,",
    "the equipartition is also nearly perfect between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , but the @xmath59 luminosity is less than half that after 50  ms out to 600  ms when this simulation terminates .",
    "similar results are found in a garching simulation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , `` equipartition '' probably should be taken to mean `` equal to within about a factor of two . ''",
    "a recent systematic study of flavor - dependent neutrino transport also concludes that one can not expect the flux equipartition to be exact throughout the sn evolution  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino average energies obey the well - known hierarchy @xmath60 which is explained by the different trapping processes , @xmath61  processes for the electron flavor and elastic scattering on nucleons for the rest .",
    "therefore , the different flavors originate in layers with different temperatures . a physical understanding of the neutrino spectra can be developed without large - scale numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "while the flavor hierarchy of average energies appears to be generic , the differences are likely smaller than previously thought after all relevant processes have been included , notably nucleon bremsstrahlung and energy transfer by recoils  @xcite .",
    "the average neutrino energies increase for the first few seconds .",
    "this is a generic effect because the neutrino - emitting regions heat up by accretion and by the contraction of the neutron star .",
    "numerical neutrino light curves can be compared with the sn  1987a data where the measured energies are found to be `` too low . '' for example , the numerical simulation of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] yields time - integrated values @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . on the other hand ,",
    "the data imply @xmath65 at kamiokande and 11.1  mev at imb  @xcite .",
    "even the 95% confidence range for kamiokande implies @xmath66 .",
    "flavor oscillations would increase the expected energies and thus enhance the discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "it has remained unclear if these and other anomalies of the sn  1987a neutrino signal should be blamed on small - number statistics , or point to a serious problem with the sn models or the detectors .",
    "a serious confrontation of sn theory with neutrino data has to await a high - statistics observation .",
    "detectors for measuring the neutrinos from a galactic sn have almost continuously operated since 1980 when the baksan scintillator telescope ( bst ) started . for a sn at a distance of 10  kpc with neutrino fluxes and spectra roughly like those of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , bst would register about 70  events .",
    "the neutrinos from sn  1987a in the large magellanic cloud at a distance of 50  kpc were measured in kamiokande  @xcite , imb  @xcite , and bst  @xcite with a few events each . today",
    ", much larger detectors exist , although bst keeps running .",

    "[ fig:4 ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . of course ,",
    "a sn observation by super - kamiokande depends on the reconstruction of the detector after its damage by the accident of 12 november  2001 .",
    "fortunately , there are other large observatories .",
    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) would register about 800  events  @xcite , ignoring flavor oscillations .",
    "the large volume detector ( lvd ) in the gran sasso laboratory is a scintillation detector that would register about 400  events  @xcite .",
    "a similar number of events would be expected in the kamland scintillation experiment which took up operations  @xcite and about 200 in miniboone  @xcite .",

    "pole neutrino telescope also works as a sn neutrino detector in that the correlated noise of all photomultipliers caused by the cherenkov light of the sn neutrinos produces a significant signal , especially when amanda is enlarged to the km@xmath67 icecube  @xcite .",

    "sno has a unique @xmath57 detection capability from the cc deuterium dissociation @xmath69 .",
    "neutral - current reactions which are sensitive to all flavors include elastic scattering on electrons , the deuterium dissociation @xmath70 in sno , the excitation of @xmath71 in water cherenkov detectors , and the corresponding excitation of @xmath72 in scintillation detectors , notably in lvd and kamland , where the @xmath73-rays from the subsequent de - excitation can be measured .",
    "another possibility is proton elastic scattering that can cause a measurable scintillation signal  @xcite .",
    "specific neutral - current detectors for sn neutrinos have been proposed on the basis of the reaction @xmath74 where the neutron will be measured .",
    "for example , lead or iron could be used as targets in the proposed omnis detector  @xcite .",
    "this sort of detector would be complementary to super - kamiokande and sno in that it is primarily sensitive to the heavy - flavor neutrinos .    at present",
    "one debates the possibility of building even larger detectors for precision neutrino long - baseline oscillation experiments , proton decay , and high - statistics solar , atmospheric and sn neutrino detection .",
    "a typical size could be a megatonne of water or scintillator .",
    "this option is discussed under the name of hyper - kamiokande in japan  @xcite , under uno in the us  @xcite , and is also debated in europe  @xcite .",
    "such a detector could produce as many as @xmath75 events from our fiducial sn at 10  kpc .",
    "the most crucial question is the sn rate in our galaxy because even the largest foreseen detectors will barely cover the local group .",
    "a sn in the largest member , andromeda ( m31 ) , at a distance of about 750  kpc would yield only about 30 events in a megatonne .",
    "one approach to estimating the galactic sn rate is to use the average rates derived from external galaxies .",
    "the most recent estimate is @xmath76 core - collapse sne per century  @xcite , about a factor of  2 smaller than previous estimates  @xcite .",
    "another approach relies on the historical sn record , extrapolated to the entire galaxy .",
    "because of obscuration by dust , only sne out to a few kpc have been observed .",
    "the rate of core - collapse sne is then estimted to be 34 per century  @xcite , with a large poisson uncertainty from the small number of observed cases ( 5  sne during the past millenium ) . given the vagaries of small - number statistics , these estimates agree with each other , and with circumstantial evidence such as the estimated population of progenitor stars or the neutron - star formation rate .",
    "large neutrino detectors are motivated by many goals so that it is not unrealistic to expect another few decades of coverage . within that time",
    "one may well observe a galactic sn even though they are rare .",
    "a high - statistics neutrino light curve would allow one to observe directly the collapse dynamics .",
    "for example , the early accretion - powered neutrino emission could be clearly distinguished from the subsequent neutron - star cooling phase  @xcite .",
    "one of the most energetic astrophysical phenomena would be caught in the act , allowing one to unravel the underlying physics .",
    "in principle , neutrino masses can be measured by the dispersion of a neutrino burst from a pulsed source , notably a sn .",
    "the time - of - flight delay of massive neutrinos with energy @xmath77 is @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the distance to the source .",
    "therefore , if a neutrino burst has the intrinsic duration @xmath80 and the energies are broadly distributed around some typical energy @xmath77 , one is approximately sensitive to masses @xmath81 the measured @xmath58 burst of sn  1987a was characterized by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , leading to the well - known limit @xmath85 @xcite . a recent re - analysis yields a somewhat more restrictive limit  @xcite .",
    "either way , these results are only of historical interest because the tritium and cosmological limits are now much more restrictive .",
    "a high - statistics observation of a future galactic sn would yield more restrictive limits because the relevant time scale @xmath80 is the fast rise time of around 100  ms rather than the overall burst duration of several seconds .",
    "therefore , one is sensitive to smaller masses than the sn  1987a burst , despite the shorter baseline .",

    "conceivably this sensitivity could be improved if a gravitational wave signal could be detected preceding the neutrinos , signifying the instant of the stellar collapse and bounce @xcite . in this case",
    "one may be sensitive to about 1  ev .",
    "it is also conceivable that a sn collapses to a black hole some short time after the original collapse . in this case",
    "the neutrino signal would terminate within @xmath87 , thereby defining a very short time scale .",
    "super - kamiokande would be sensitive to @xmath88 @xcite . with a megatonne detector one could measure sn neutrinos throughout the local group of galaxies . from andromeda at a distance of 750  kpc one would get around 30 events . using the overall signal duration for @xmath80 yields a sensitivity of a few  ev .",
    "the only conceivable time - of - flight technique that could probe the sub - ev range involves gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) which have been speculated to be strong neutrino sources .",
    "if the neutrino emission shows time structure on the millisecond scale , and assuming a cosmological distance of 1  gpc , one would be sensitive to neutrino masses @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , observing millisecond time structure in sub - gev neutrinos from a grb would be sensitive to the sub - ev mass scale @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillations are now firmly established so that the sn neutrino fluxes and spectra in a detector can be very different from those emitted by the source .",
    "this is especially true if the favored solar lma case applies .",
    "the relevant mass difference implies that matter effects are important in the sn , and also in the earth if the neutrinos enter the detector `` from below . ''",
    "the large `` solar '' mixing angle @xmath90 implies that oscillations will be important in both the @xmath57 and @xmath58 channel . in the lma case",
    "it is unavoidable , for example , that oscillations influence the sn  1987a signal interpretation , and that the detectors saw different spectra due to different earth - crossing paths @xcite . taking oscillations into account will be crucial for extracting information about the source if a future galactic sn is observed @xcite .    taking the numerical source model of fig",
    ".  [ fig:4 ] , the time - integrated spectra at super - kamiokande and sno are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] for different nadir angles which determines the earth - crossing path .",
    "the oscillation parameters were chosen for the lma case with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "the unknown third mixing angle was chosen small as @xmath95 .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] illustrates that dramatic modifications of the spectra can be expected for certain cases .",
    "it is difficult to anticipate everything about future data .",
    "if a galactic sn is observed , what we can learn about neutrino oscillations depends on the detectors operating at that time and their geographical location .",
    "it will also depend on the true source properties regarding flavor - dependent spectra and fluxes , and what is already known about the neutrino oscillation parameters as input information at that time .",
    "many authors have studied these questions .",
    "it appears that one may well distinguish between large and small values of the elusive @xmath96 and between normal or inverted mass hierarchies , or even accurately pin down @xmath97 .",
    "an important caveat is that these studies usually made unrealistic assumptions about the source spectra and fluxes  @xcite .",
    "more realistic cases remain to be investigated .",
    "still , a sn neutrino observation would complement the upcoming efforts of precision determination of neutrino oscillation parameters in long - baseline experiments  @xcite .",
    "the compelling detection of flavor oscillations in the solar and atmospheric neutrino data have triggered a new era in neutrino physics . in the laboratory one",
    "will proceed with precision experiments aimed at measuring the details of the mixing matrix .",
    "future tritium decay experiments may well be able to probe the overall neutrino mass scale down to the 0.3  ev range , but if the absolute masses are smaller , it will be very difficult to measure them , and the overall mass scale may remain the most important unknown quantity in neutrino physics for a long time to come .",
    "cosmological large - scale structure data at present provide the most restrictive limit on neutrino masses of @xmath98 , corresponding to @xmath99 in a degenerate mass scenario .",
    "a rigorous relationship between the cosmic hot dark matter fraction @xmath14 and @xmath2 depends on the cosmic neutrino density  @xmath29 .",
    "if the solar lma solution is correct , big - bang nucleosynthesis constrains @xmath29 without further assumptions about the neutrino chemical potentials . in the lma case",
    "neutrinos reach de - facto flavor equilibrium before the epoch of weak - interaction freeze out .    while neutrinos provide only a small fraction of the cosmic mass density , the mass and mixing schemes suggested by the oscillation experiments are nicely consistent with leptogenesis scenarios for creating the cosmic baryon asymmetry . therefore , massive neutrinos may be more closely related to the cosmic baryons than the dark matter",
    ".    experimental neutrino physics is developing fast .",
    "it is foreseeable that a broad range of neutrino detectors will operate for a long time , perhaps decades , with a variety of goals from precision oscillation physics to proton decay .",
    "typically such detectors are also sensitive to sn neutrinos so that one may expect the neutrino sky to be covered perhaps for decades . even though galactic sne are rare , the neutrinos from about a thousand sne are on their way , and the expected time scale of neutrino coverage makes a future high - statistics sn observation a realistic possibility .",
    "the existing neutrino mass limits are already so low that one can not expect improving them with a galactic sn observation .",
    "turning this around , we already know so much about neutrinos that we can be sure that the observed sn neutrino light curve faithfully represents the behavior of the source , without modifications by dispersion effects .",
    "the same can not be said about the spectra which are inevitably modified by flavor oscillations .",
    "depending on the details of the source spectra , detection channel , and location on earth , flavor oscillations can have a large impact on the observations , and may even allow one to disentangle some of the neutrino mixing scenarios .",
    "arguably the most important benefit of a high - statistics measurement of stellar collapse would be observing the dynamics of a cataclysmic astrophysical event that could never be observed in any other way . whether or not numerical sn simulations will soon converge on a theoretical standard model for the collapse and explosion mechanism ,",
    "the importance of its independent verification or falsification by a detailed neutrino light curve can not be overstated .",
    "as we learn more about neutrinos , their future role is likely that of astrophysical messengers , showing us phenomena that otherwise would remain forever invisible .",
