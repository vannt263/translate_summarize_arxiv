    "<S> we tested our conjecture for several quantum quenches in the @xmath1 spin chain , for which the stationary state is known , although we expect   to be valid in general . </S>",

    "<S> . it would be also interesting to obtain analytic expressions for the entanglement dynamics starting from inhomogeneous initial states , exploiting the recent analytical results  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we find remarkable that it is possible to characterize analytically the post - quench behavior of the entanglement entropy , while the derivation of the ground - state entanglement entropy in interacting integrable models is still an open problem . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although we provided robust numerical evidence for  , an _ ab initio _ derivation using bethe ansatz methods would be highly desirable .    finally , the physical meaning of   represents a deep conceptual breakthrough since it shows in a single compact formula how the entanglement entropy becomes the thermodynamic entropy for an arbitrary integrable model . </S>",
