    "there have been many works to study properties of the @xmath0(1405 ) and its roles in nuclear physics @xcite . however , its nature is not revealed completely , i.e. , an ordinary three quark state or a @xmath7 bound state or a mixed state of the previous two possibilities . for a historical review and another references , see @xcite . the @xmath0 ( 1405 )",
    "has long been considered as a @xmath7 bound state @xcite since it is just below the @xmath7 threshold .",
    "thus , it is assumed to be a candidate of hadronic molecules , which are weakly - bound states of two or more hadrons . in this paper",
    "we use the qcd sum rule approach to predict a mass of the @xmath0(1405 ) considering a multiquark picture .",
    "qcd sum rule@xcite is one of powerful tools to extract the hadron properties directly from qcd .",
    "applications of this approach to the @xmath0 ( 1405 ) were done in ref .",

    "one can assume the @xmath0(1405 ) as a @xmath7 hadronic molecular state ( five - quark state ) and investigate the possibility following the same procedures in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath8 multiquark state there are no exchange diagrams at tree level such as those shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , at tree level it is impossible to determine whether there is a binding effect or not in the @xmath8 multiquark state . on the other hand the @xmath0 ( 1405 )",
    "is observed in the mass spectrum of the @xmath9 channel ( i=0 ) , so it would be interesting to get a mass assuming the @xmath9 multiquark state instead of the @xmath7 multiquark state . among three @xmath9 channels ,",

    "we neglect the contribution of gluon condensates and concentrate on tree diagrams , and assume the vacuum saturation hypothesis to calculate quark condensates of higher dimensions .",

    "[ fig_loop ] ( a ) , ( b ) we present only some typical diagrams .",
    "then , we can use the same strategy in ref.@xcite : first , consider 2 loop - type only and vary the continuum threshold @xmath42 and the borel interval @xmath51 in order that the mass should be 1.328 gev ( the sum of a pion and a @xmath52 mass ) .",
    "the borel interval @xmath51 is restricted by the following conditions as usual : the lower limit of @xmath51 is determined as the value at which the power correction is below than 30% .",
    "the upper limit is determined as the value where the continuum contribution in the mass prediction is less than 50% .",
    "second , consider all diagrams ( 1 loop - type + 2 loop - type ) and get a new mass @xmath53 at the same @xmath42 and borel interval @xmath51 which are obtained from the first step .",
    "third , compare @xmath53 with 1.328 gev .",

    "the results are given in table  [ table_qc ] .",
    "it shows that there is a binding effect in @xmath44 sum rule while a repulsive effect in @xmath45 sum rule .",
    "the binding effect is about 32 mev in @xmath44 sum rule .",

    "the difference between the average mass and the threshold value is about 3 mev as shown in the table .",
    "we also present the dependence of @xmath53 on different quark condensates in table  [ table_qc ] .",
    "the mass is rarely changed for different quark condensates .",
    "the dependencies of @xmath53 on the s - quark mass and the s - quark condensate are given in tables  [ table_sqm ] and  [ table_sc ] , respectively .",
    "in our approach , if we take another s - quark mass and/or s - quark condensate , then the continuum threshold and/or the borel interval also should be changed to reproduce the mass @xmath41 ( 1.328 gev ) .",
    "thus , the variation of the mass @xmath53 is small .",
    "as we said , @xmath44 sum rule is less reliable than @xmath45 sum rule , and if we take a large value of the quark condensate the average mass becomes slightly smaller than the threshold in the case of @xmath45 sum rule .",
    "hence , at present stage it is difficult to determine whether there is the binding effect in the @xmath1 multiquark state .",

    "there is the maximum point in the case of @xmath45 sum rule while not in the case of @xmath44 sum rule .",

    "thus , the results for these multiquark states should be different from those for the @xmath1 multiquark state . in the case of the @xmath5 multiquark state",
    "the ope sides are given as follows .",
    "@xmath56 @xmath57 and for the @xmath6 multiquark state we get @xmath58 and @xmath59 where we take @xmath50 = 3 as in the previous @xmath1 multiquark sum rules ( hereafter @xmath1 sum rules ) .    comparing eqs .",

    "( [ ope2_q ] ) and ( [ ope2_1 ] ) each other one can easily find that the formulas are exactly the same in the su(3 ) symmetric limit .",

    "we can apply the previous method to get the mass of the @xmath8 multiquark state .",

    "we get 1.625 gev at this threshold .",
    "it is interesting to note that these values are very similar to each other , and close to that of the @xmath0 ( 1600 ) which can decay to both @xmath7 and @xmath9 channels@xcite .",
    "similarly , taking into account the threshold for the @xmath9 sum rule we can get the mass of the @xmath8 multiquark state .",
    "the masses are 1.387 gev and 1.412 gev for @xmath42 = 3.012 gev@xmath48 and @xmath42 = 3.112 gev@xmath48 , respectively .",

    "@xmath45 sum rule the dominant operator has the form of @xmath67 while @xmath68 in @xmath44 sum rule .",

    "full quantitative analysis , however , would require all the above corrections and is beyond the scope of this paper .    in summary , the mass of the @xmath0(1405 )",
    "is predicted using the @xmath1 multiquark interpolating field .",
    "the predicted mass from @xmath45 sum rule ( the chiral - odd sum rule ) is about 1.419 gev .",
    "the mass sum rules for the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 multiquark state are also presented , and compared to those for the @xmath1 multiquark state .",
