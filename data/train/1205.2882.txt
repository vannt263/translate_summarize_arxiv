    "in spite of the numerous efforts to achieve a satisfactory understanding of entanglement for systems of identical particles , there is no general agreement on the appropriate generalization of concepts valid for non - identical constituents  @xcite .",
    "that is because many concepts are usually only discussed in the context of quantum systems for which the hilbert space @xmath0 is a simple tensor product with no additional structure .",
    "an example is the hilbert space @xmath1 of two non identical particles . in this case",
    "the partial trace @xmath2 for @xmath3 to obtain the reduced density matrix has a good physical meaning : it corresponds to observations only on the subsystem @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , the hilbert space of a system of @xmath5 identical bosons ( fermions ) is given by the symmetric ( antisymmetric ) @xmath5-fold tensor product of the single - particle spaces .",
    "the consequence is that any multi - particle state contains _ intrinsic _ correlations between subsystems due to quantum indistinguishability .",
    "this , in turn , forces a departure from the straightforward application of entanglement - related concepts like singular value decomposition ( svd ) , schmidt rank , or entanglement entropy .    in this context ,",
    "schliemann et al .",
    "@xcite have introduced an analogue of the schmidt rank , the ` slater rank ' to study entanglement in two - fermion systems , using a new version of the svd adapted to deal with antisymmetric matrices .",
    "the extension of these ideas to the boson case was worked out in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these approaches also have not found general acceptance .",
    "the problems arising in the interpretation of the slater rank and the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix ( obtained by partial tracing ) for these systems have been analyzed in @xcite .    numerous other proposals for the treatment of identical particles",
    "have recently been put forward .",
    "but , as a closer look at the literature on the subject  @xcite reveals , it is apparent that there is no consensus yet as to what the proper formalism should be .    in this paper , we propose an approach to the study of entanglement based on the theory of operator algebras .",
    "the foundational results of gelfand , naimark and segal on the representation theory of @xmath6-algebras , abbreviated as the _ _ gns - construction__@xcite are used in order to obtain a generalized notion of entanglement . in particular , the notion of _ partial trace _ is replaced by the much more general notion of _ _ restriction of a state to a subalgebra__@xcite .",
    "this will allow us to treat entanglement of identical and non - identical particles on an equal footing , without the need to resort to different separability criteria according to the case under study .    in order to display the usefulness of our approach",
    ", several explicit examples will be worked out . in particular",
    "we show that the gns - construction gives zero for the von neumann entropy of a fermionic or a bosonic state containing the least possible amount of correlations .",
    "we believe that this settles an issue that has caused a lot of confusion regarding the use of von neumann entropy as a measure of entanglement for identical particles @xcite .",
    "a vector state of a quantum system is usually described by a vector @xmath7 in a hilbert space @xmath0 ( pure case ) . more generally , a state is a density matrix @xmath8 , a linear map satisfying @xmath9 ( normalization ) , @xmath10 ( self - adjointness ) and positivity @xmath11 . for _",

    "such a positive linear functional of unit norm is called a _ state _ on the algebra @xmath18 .",
    "as already mentioned , in the bipartite case @xmath24 , the definition of @xmath25 involves a partial trace operation .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask for a characterization of this operation in terms of the notion of states on an algebra . for this purpose",
    "consider the subalgebra @xmath26 consisting of all operators of the form @xmath27 , for @xmath28 an observable on @xmath29 . defining a new state @xmath30 as the _ restriction _ of @xmath31 to the subalgebra @xmath26 , one easily checks that for any observable @xmath28 of @xmath29 the equality @xmath32 holds .    as we show below",
    ", an algebraic description of the quantum system where the basic objects are a @xmath6-algebra @xmath18 and a state @xmath33 on the algebra provides the solution to some of the problems that appear when @xmath0 does not have the form of a ` simple tensor product ' .",
    "the basic idea of the gns - construction is that given an algebra @xmath18 of observables and a state @xmath33 on this algebra , we can construct the hilbert space on which the algebra of observables acts on .",
    "the key steps are : ( a ) using @xmath33 , we can endow @xmath18 itself with an inner product .",
    "so it becomes an ` inner product ' space @xmath34 .",

    "( c ) if we remove these null vectors by taking the quotient of @xmath34 by the null space @xmath35 of zero norm vectors to get @xmath36 , then we have a well - defined positive definite inner product on @xmath36 .",
    "hence we get a well - defined hilbert space ( after completion ) .",
    "( d ) the algebra of observables @xmath18 acts naturally on this hilbert space in a simple manner .",
    "we now make this set of ideas more precise .    from the mathematical point of view",

    "this guarantees that one has enough structure to perform all the tasks in the list above .",

    "the map @xmath188 is an isomorphism from @xmath189 into @xmath190_. this is also important as discussed below .",
    "these constructions are most conveniently expressed in terms of a _ coproduct _ @xmath191@xcite .",
    "in fact , an approach based on hopf algebras ( as explained in  @xcite ) , has the great advantage that para- and braid - statistics can be _ automatically _ included . in our present case , the construction of the observable algebra corresponds to the following simple choice for the coproduct : @xmath192 , ( @xmath193 ) , linearly extended to all of @xmath194 .",

    "physically , the existence of such a coproduct is very important , since it allows us to homomorphically represent the one - particle observable algebra on the @xmath177-particle sector . in a many particle system , the choice to perform observations of only one - particle observables corresponds to restricting the full - algebra of observables to the homomorphic image of the one - particle observable algebra obtained by using the coproduct .",
    "now , if for some reason we perform only partial one - particle observations ( for instance , if at the one - particle level , we decide to measure -or have access to- only the spin degrees of freedom , or only the position ) , the one - particle observable algebra will have to be restricted accordingly and hence its homomorphic image at the @xmath177-particle level will be a subalgebra of the original algebra .    as we will see in what follows",
    ", the gns approach covers all such cases whether or not particles are identical .",
    "in particular it merits to reemphasize that it covers observations of particles obeying para- and braid- statistics , including anyons .      keeping the same notation as above ,",
    "put @xmath196 .",
    "we focus our attention on the two - fermion space @xmath197 , with basis @xmath198 @xmath199 being an orthonormal basis for @xmath167 . the algebra @xmath18 of observables for the two - fermion system is the matrix algebra generated by @xmath200 ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "it is isomorphic to @xmath202 .",
    "now , @xmath203 acts on @xmath167 through the defining representation ( @xmath204 ) , so that one particle observables are given - at the two fermion level - by the action of @xmath205 on @xmath206 .",
    "this action is given by the restriction of the operators @xmath207 to the space of antisymmetric vectors .",
    "let 3 be the defining ( or fundamental ) @xmath208 representation on @xmath167 .",

    "this is just the fact that the @xmath215 representation of @xmath208 is irreducible and corresponds to the fact that , for @xmath196 , all two - fermion vector states @xmath7 have slater rank 1 .",

    ". hence @xmath262 and @xmath325 are pure states with zero entropy .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath270 into irreducible subspaces , as a function of @xmath234 , is the following : @xmath326 the significant aspect of this example is the fact that for the values of @xmath327 for which the slater rank of @xmath328 is one , namely @xmath256 and @xmath329 , we obtain exactly zero for the entropy . in previous treatments of entanglement for identical particles ,",
    "the minimum value for the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix ( obtained by partial trace ) has been found to be @xmath330 ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this has been a source of embarrassment : it seems to suggest that different entanglement criteria have to be adopted , depending on whether one is dealing with non - identical particles , or with bosons , or fermions .",
    "we have shown here that , by replacing the notion of _ partial trace _ by the more general one of _ restriction to a subalgebra _ , all cases can be treated on an equal footing .",
    "here we consider the bosonic analogue of example 3 .",
    "consider the one - particle space @xmath195 with an orthonormal basis @xmath331 .",
    "the two - boson space @xmath206 is the space of symmetrized vectors in @xmath332 .",
    "it corresponds to the six - dimensional space obtained from the decomposition @xmath209 of @xmath208 .",
    "an orthonormal basis for @xmath206 is given by vectors @xmath333 , where @xmath334 the algebra @xmath18 of observables for the two boson system is thus isomorphic to @xmath335 .",
    "consider the state @xmath336 corresponding to the vector @xmath337 to the subalgebra @xmath26 of one - particle observables pertaining _ only _ to the one - particle vectors @xmath216 and @xmath217 . proceeding in the same way as in the previous examples , we recognize that the 6 representation , when regarded as a representation space for @xmath272 acting nontrivially on @xmath216 and @xmath217 , splits as @xmath338 .",
    "the basis vectors for these three invariant subspaces are given below : @xmath339 the one - particle observables on @xmath206 are obtained from the operators @xmath340 ( with @xmath90 ) , as well as from the unit operator on @xmath167 , by means of the coproduct .",
    "thus , the subalgebra @xmath26 is generated by operators of the form @xmath341 , with both @xmath342 and @xmath343 belonging to the _ same _ irreducible component of @xmath206 .",
    "( note that the image of unity on @xmath167 under the coproduct @xmath191 is @xmath43 .",
    "hence by taking combinations of images of the above @xmath167-observables under @xmath191 , we see that @xmath26 contains @xmath344 ) . in other words",
    ", @xmath26 is given by block - diagonal matrices , with each block corresponding to one of the irreducible components in the decomposition @xmath338 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath26 is therefore @xmath345 .",
    "the construction of the gns - representation corresponding to each particular value of the parameters @xmath234 and @xmath346 is performed following the same procedure as in example 3 .",
    "let us introduce the notation @xmath347 , for any pair @xmath348 in ( [ invariant ] ) .",
    "then , from ( [ eq : bosons ] ) we see that as long as the @xmath349-coefficients are all different from zero , those elements of @xmath26 of the form @xmath350 ( @xmath351 ) and @xmath352 ( @xmath353 ) generate the null vectors . that these generate all the null vectors follows from the fact that ( [ eq : bosons ] ) contains one basis element for every irreducible component , so that no further linear relation can arise that lead to null vectors .",
    "so in this case we have @xmath354 in terms of irreducible subspaces , one can readily see that @xmath355 decomposes according to @xmath356 .    in general , we can read off the decomposition of @xmath357 into irreducible subspaces from ( [ eq : bosons ] ) , depending on which of its coefficents vanish .",
    "for example , if only the first one vanishes , @xmath358 it is interesting to consider the entropy as a function of @xmath349 . for the case",
    "in which all @xmath349-coefficients are non - zero , we have : @xmath110\\rangle= |[b_{1,1}]\\rangle+ |[b_{1/2,1/2}]\\rangle + |[b_{\\tilde 0 , \\tilde 0}]\\rangle,\\ ] ] from which the entropy is readily computed as before .",
    "the result is : @xmath359 -   \\cos^2\\theta\\log ( \\cos\\theta)^2.\\ ] ]    the analytic formulae for entropy when one or more of the coefficients in ( [ invariant ] ) vanish can be obtained from ( [ eq : boson - entropy ] ) by taking suitable limits on @xmath234 and @xmath346 .",
    "we can see that the entropy vanishes whenever @xmath360 lies in a single irreducible component .",
    "this happens precisely at those points of the two - sphere generated by the parameters @xmath349 that correspond to the coordinate axes .",
    "there are therefore six points where the entropy vanishes exactly .",
    "this is depicted in figure [ fig ] , where the @xmath349-sphere has been mapped to the @xmath361-@xmath362 plane through a stereographic projection .",
    "the figure shows the entropy as a function of the coordinates of that plane .     the entropy equation ( [ eq : boson - entropy ] ) as a function of @xmath361 and @xmath362 , the coordinates of a plane representing the @xmath349-sphere through stereographic projection .",
    "darker regions correspond to lower values of the entropy .",
    "five of the six vanishing points of the entropy can be seen on the picture ( black spots ) .",
    "the sixth one , corresponding to the north - pole of the sphere , lies ` at infinity ' in this representation . ]",
    "we have presented a new approach to the study of quantum entanglement based on restriction of states to subalgebras .",
    "the gns - construction allows us to obtain a representation space for the subalgebra such that its decomposition into irreducible subspaces can be used to study quantum correlations .",
    "we showed that , when applied to bipartite systems for which the hilbert space is a ` simple ' tensor product , our method reproduces the standard results on entanglement .",
    "we furthermore showed , with explicit examples , how the formalism can be applied to systems of identical particles .",
    "our results demonstrate in a clear fashion that the von neumann entropy indeed remains a suitable entanglement measure , when understood in terms of states on algebras of observables .",
    "the formalism used for the treatment of identical particles , using coproducts to identify algebras of subsytems can be easily generalized to more sophisticated situations such as those of particles obeying para- and braid statistics .",
    "our results can hence be extended to the study of entanglement of such particles .",
    "it can even be extended to study for instance a @xmath177-particle subsystem in an @xmath5 particle hilbert space .",
