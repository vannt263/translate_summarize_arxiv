    "the term `` flocking '' ( or equivalently swarming , schooling , herding etc . )",
    "describes the ability of groups of living organisms to move coherently in space and time @xcite .",
    "this behavior is ubiquitous in nature : it occurs in sub - cellular systems @xcite , bacteria @xcite , insects @xcite , fish @xcite , birds @xcite and in general in nearly any group of individuals endowed with the ability to move and sense .",
    "this spectacular example of robustness has inspired science and technology in a two - fold way : on the one hand scientists have focused their efforts in understanding the origin of a collective behavior found in systems of such an astonishing diversity @xcite ; on the other hand technologists have envisioned the possibility of implementing this form of social organization that spontaneously arises in living systems to construct flocks of devices that can work independently and yet collectively towards a common goal @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting question in the context of collective behavior in biological and bio - inspired systems revolves around how groups respond to the leadership of a subset of individuals having pertinent information . in animals ,",
    "such information might represent the location of a food source @xcite , a specific migration route @xcite , or a threat of which part of the group is unaware , such as a predator only visible to a minority of individuals @xcite .",
    "in biomimetic systems , on the other hand , this might consist of a set of instructions related to the group task .",
    "the response of schooling fish to leadership has represented , in particular , the focus of several empirical studies .",
    "this is due to the possibility of training fish to swim toward a specific target , expect food at a given time or location @xcite or the ability to insert remote - controlled replica animals @xcite , thus acting as leaders for the remaining fish .",
    "while varying in the details , these studies have demonstrated that large groups of individuals are able to adopt the behavior of an informed subset .",
    "the statistical mechanics of leadership and decision making in animal groups has been systematically investigated by couzin and coworkers in a series of seminal works @xcite . using a combination of experiments and numerical simulations based on self - propelled particles models , they showed that communities of collectively moving individuals are able to make consensus decisions in the presence of a small minority of unorganized informed individuals .",
    "furthermore , they demonstrated that when two informed subsets with competing behaviors are introduced , the group selects the behavior of the larger informed subset with an accuracy that increases with the number of uninformed individuals @xcite .",
    "the generality and the robustness of these results have acted as a stimulus to identify a generic mechanism behind leadership and decision making in systems of collectively moving individuals @xcite . yet , whether it is possible to identify the basic laws governing the response of a group to leadership , is still unclear .    in order to gain insight into this problem , we present here a linear response analysis of a model flock whose dynamics is described by the vicsek model with angular noise @xcite .",
    "we study how a collection of flocking agents responds to the leadership of a randomly selected subset of the entire flock that is biased to turn toward a specific direction . using numerical simulations and continuous modeling ,",
    "we demonstrate that the system s response to leadership can be cast in the framework of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , upon introducing an `` effective temperature '' proportional to the ratio between the correlation and response functions and generally dependent on the system density , velocity and noise .",
    "remarkably , both the density and velocity dependence disappear at large densities , revealing a universal linear dependence of the effective temperature on the noise variance .",
    "we then apply this approach to the case wherein the flock must choose between two subsets of leaders with competing interests , identifying again a linear response to the total perturbation applied by both groups . in this case , however , the flock behavioral decision is determined by both the number of leaders and their degree of influence , so a small subgroup of particularly influential informed individuals can overrule a larger subset of less influential informed individuals .",
    "let us consider the vicsek model subject to angular white noise @xcite .",
    "the system consists of @xmath0 individuals traveling at velocity @xmath1 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 a constant speed , on a square @xmath4 periodic two - dimensional domain . at each time",
    "step each individual takes the average direction of those within some pre - defined radius @xmath5 as its new direction . thus :    [ eq : vicsek_model ] @xmath6 \\theta_{i}(t+\\delta t ) = \\langle \\theta_{i}(t ) \\rangle_{r } + \\xi_{i}\\;,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the position of the @xmath8th individual at time @xmath9 , @xmath10 a uniformly distributed random angle in the range @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath12 is the average orientation of all the individuals within a distance @xmath5 from @xmath7 , including the @xmath8th one . following a classic convention , we set @xmath13 , thus choosing @xmath14 as unit of time and the interaction range @xmath5 as unit of distance .    in order to study the linear response of the flock to a perturbation",
    ", we consider the system polarization vector , defined as @xmath15 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath16 serves as an order parameter and allows to distinguish the isotropic ( where @xmath17 ) and flocking ( @xmath18 ) phase @xcite .",
    "the unit vector @xmath19 , on the other hand , represents the global direction of the flock .",
    "now , deeply in the order phase ( i.e @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 changes very slowly and the polarization vector randomly precesses along the unit circle ( supplementary movie s1 @xcite ) . to quantify this process",
    "we introduce a discrete analog of curvature in the flock trajectory : @xmath22\\cdot\\bm{\\hat{z}}\\;.\\ ] ] in the absence of any rotational bias , the flock is equally likely to turn left or right , and @xmath23 follows the gaussian distribution ( fig . [ fig : linear_response]a ) with zero mean value and finite variance .",
    "next , let us consider a subset of @xmath24 randomly chosen `` informed individuals '' within the flock , who are biased to turn toward a specific direction .",
    "for each of them ,",
    "( [ eq : vicsek_model]b ) is replaced by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a constant angular displacement representing the `` degree of influence '' of each informed individual within its neighborhood . while there are other ways to introduce an internal bias in the vicsek model @xcite , this is possibly the one that most closely resembles maneuvers in real flocks .",
    "the product @xmath27 is analogous to an _ effective torque _ that is able to bend the trajectory of flock toward the left or right , depending on the sign of @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : snap]b and ( supplementary movie s2 @xcite ) .    in order to investigate the influence of the informed individuals in the general behavior of the flock , we have performed various numerical simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : linear_response ] and appendix b ) . as a consequence of the directional bias introduced by the informed individuals , the trajectory of the flock acquires a non - zero mean curvature that grows linearly with the torque per individual : i.e. @xmath28 , where @xmath29 represent a time average in the presence of an effective torque @xmath30 ( fig , [ fig : linear_response]b ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that the linear response of the flock to leadership is not independently governed by the number of leaders @xmath31 or their influence @xmath26 , but rather by their product @xmath30 , so that doubling the number of leaders in the group is equivalent to keeping their number fixed , while doubling their influence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phitemps ] ) .",
    "the total mean squared curvature @xmath32 is , on the other hand , independent of @xmath30 for small @xmath30 values and plateaus to the curvature variance @xmath33 of the unbiased flock ( fig , [ fig : linear_response]c ) . as a consequence , the ratio between the slope @xmath34 and @xmath35 depends on the flock population and size only through its density @xmath36 .",
    "this allows us to formulate the following linear response relation for the vicsek model subject to the leadership of a subset of informed individuals : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an effective rotational diffusion coefficient , generally dependent on the system density , noise and particle velocity .",
    "in order to gain insight into the dependence of @xmath38 on the remaining free parameters of the system , we have repeated the previous analysis for various @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : linear_response]d and fig .",
    "[ fig : v0comparison ] ) and find that , surprisingly , the density and velocity dependence disappears at high densities , revealing a universal linear dependence of @xmath38 on the variance of noise : @xmath42 .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    ". is a special case of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) , with a collective effective temperature @xmath43 . in the realm of active matter ,",
    "the possibility of an effective temperature and a generalized fdt has been discussed for both dilute and dense phases @xcite , sometimes with contradictory results . unlike in equilibrium systems , where any perturbation @xmath44 to the hamiltonian results into a fluctuation - dissipation relation of the form : @xmath45\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are generic observables , @xmath48 is an external field coupled to the observable @xmath47 and and @xmath49 is a _",
    "unique _ temperature , relations like eq .",
    "hold , outside of equilibrium , only for specific choice of observables and perturbations .",
    "@xcite analyzed , for instance , the response of a vicsek flock to a spatially uniform aligning field and found no evidence of a fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "this was instead identified by chat and coworkers @xcite , who considered an external field coupled with the local average polarization .",
    "the effective temperature resulting from this relation , however , varies in the parameter space .",
    "our findings , indicate that a special form of the fdt , with an effective temperature only dependent on the variance of angular noise , can be identified in the vicsek model subject to the leadership of a subset of informed individuals , as long as the system is sufficiently dense .",
    "we further stress that the linear response to nonuniform internal torques , discussed here , appears to be fundamentally different from the highly nonlinear response to uniform aligning fields recently reported by kyriakopoulos _",
    "et al_. @xcite .      to shed light on the numerical results presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : discrete_flocks ] and , in particular , the universal behavior of the coefficient @xmath38 at large densities , we have considered the effect of leadership in a mean - field `` continuous flock '' confined in a periodic domain . calling @xmath40 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the flock density , velocity and momentum density , respectively , the flock dynamics is governed by a modified version of toner - tu hydrodynamics equations @xcite :    [ eq : toner_tu ] @xmath52    where @xmath53 is a density dependent pressure and @xmath54 is a delta - correlated random force , such that : @xmath55 .",
    "interestingly , equations very similar to these have been also used by alicea _",
    "et al_. to explain zero resistance states in two - dimensional electron electron gasses driven by microwaves @xcite .",
    "the amplitude @xmath56 is evidently proportional to the variance of the angular noise in the original vicsek model , i.e. @xmath57 . the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : toner_tu]b ) , representing a uniform rigid body rotation with constant angular velocity @xmath58 , embodies the effect of the torque exerted by the informed individuals in the flock . in order to recover the high - density limit , we assume the system to be incompressible and strongly polarized .",
    "the former assumption , in particular , has profound consequences on the critical behavior of the system and , as it was recently demonstrated in refs.@xcite , ascribes the continuous ( incompressible ) and discrete ( compressible ) model to different universality classes . as we will see later ,",
    "this distinction , however , does not affect the response to leadership , as long as the system is deeply in the polarized state , and thus well below the flocking phase transition .",
    "after some algebraic manipulations ( see appendix a ) , eqs . yield the following equation for the total polarization : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the departure of the order polarization amplitude from its mean value @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a gaussianly distributed random function delta - correlated in time : @xmath63 . according to eq . , the dynamics of the total polarization depends on the various parameters appearing in eq .",
    ", exclusively through the fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "thus , consistently with our numerical simulations , the total polarization approaches a universal behavior as the flock becomes uniformly polarized .",
    "in this regime , @xmath60 decays exponentially over a time scale of order @xmath64 .",
    "thus , for @xmath65 , projecting eq . on the transverse direction yields : @xmath66 where @xmath67 . the discrete curvature @xmath23 can be obtained by integrating the local curvature over a finite time interval @xmath14 , namely : @xmath68 as a consequence of eqs . and @xmath23 is gaussianly distributed , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this , finally , implies the linear response relation , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in order to verify the quality of the agreement between our discrete and continuous model , we have plotted the normalized probability distribution function of @xmath73 ( @xmath74 in our simulations ) for various torques and noise variances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : linear_response]a inset ) . as predicted by our continuous model ,",
    "the data fall on the same gaussian .",
    "we next turn our attention to how flocks make decisions . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "combined experimental and theoretical studies on schooling fish @xcite have demonstrated that , in the presence of competing interests ( i.e. such as swimming toward two different targets ) , the group decides to conform to the behavior of the largest minority with an accuracy that increases with the number of uninformed individuals .",
    "our approach allows us to study this result in a system where the response can vary continuously . to this purpose ,",
    "we have introduced a second subset of @xmath75 individuals with an angular displacement @xmath76 , so that @xmath77 is now the total number of informed individuals and the flock must decide between two competing informed subsets .",
    "[ fig : decision_making]a shows that the sign of the resulting curvature of the flock is dictated by the largest subset of informed individuals ; this is true even when the competing subsets in the flock are of similar size , @xmath78 .",
    "however , as the number of informed individuals becomes large , @xmath79 , the standard deviation in the curvature , @xmath80 , significantly increases and the flock becomes less efficient at selecting the correct behavior .",
    "this is because when most individuals in the flock are leaders , with either a positive or negative curvature , there are few followers to average out the competing effects .",
    "[ fig : decision_making]c shows the response of a flock when @xmath81 .",
    "here we see again that the presence of uninformed individuals reduces the standard deviation , but the resulting curvature is no longer symmetric around @xmath82 .",
    "hence a smaller but sufficiently influential subgroup can dictate the sign of the curvature of the flock trajectory .",
    "our results suggest that linear response to leadership can be extended in the presence of two competing subsets of informed individuals upon introducing a generalized effective torque @xmath83 .",
    "to verify this we fixed the relative size of the informed subsets ( @xmath84 ) and vary their relative influence @xmath85 achieving a range of responses , see fig .",
    "[ fig : decision_making_torque]a . by normalizing the response curvature by this newly defined @xmath30",
    "we find that all the results fall onto the same value , fig .",
    "[ fig : decision_making_torque]b .",
    "this confirms that the linear response to leadership extends to competing subgroups of leaders implying that all these flocks are at the same effective temperature .",
    "hence flocks do not merely select the behavior of the largest subset of informed individuals , but rather the resulting behavior is the response to the total influence of both subsets on the flocks ( the same result can be achieved by fixing @xmath85 and varying @xmath84 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phitemps ] ) .",
    "we have investigated how a model flock respond to the leadership of a subset of informed individuals . using numerical simulations and continuous modeling ,",
    "we have demonstrated that the process obeys to a special form of the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) , with an emerging effective temperature that depends uniquely on the variance of noise for sufficiently dense systems .",
    "the linear response to leadership also holds in the presence of two subgroups of informed individuals with competing interests , in this case the flock behavioral decision is determined by both the number of leaders and their degree of influence . so that a small subgroup of particularly influential informed individuals can overrule a larger subset of less influential informed individuals .",
    "our theoretical results provide general insight into leadership in collective behavior and can be used to shed light on previous experimental studies , particularly those on schooling fish @xcite . in bird flocks ,",
    "recent observations have demonstrated that maneuvers can be initiated by a single leader @xcite with the reaction of the nearby birds propagating linearly through the flock .",
    "this spatial and structural dependence of the recruitment of leaders , and subsequent followers , is a clear next step for the work presented here .",

    "<S> large collections of autonomously moving agents , such as animals or micro - organisms , are able to `` flock '' coherently in space even in the absence of a central control mechanism . while the direction of the flock resulting from this critical behavior is random , this can be controlled by a small subset of informed individuals acting as leaders of the group . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we use the vicsek model to investigate how flocks respond to leadership and make decisions . using a combination of numerical simulations and continuous modeling we demonstrate that flocks display a linear response to leadership that can be cast in the framework of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , identifying an `` effective temperature '' reflecting how promptly the flock reacts to the initiative of the leaders . the linear response to leadership also holds in the presence of two groups of informed individuals with competing interests , indicating that the flock s behavioral decision is determined by both the number of leaders and their degree of influence . </S>"
