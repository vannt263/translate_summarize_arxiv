    "precise measurements of power spectrum of current are powerful means for investigating electron transport in solid - state devices with a dilution refrigerator @xcite-@xcite . in conventional methods , cryogenic current amplifiers based on high - electron - mobility transistors ( hemts ) @xcite-@xcite or superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids )",
    "@xcite are used as the first - stage current amplifier . in these systems ,",
    "the amplifier s noise severely limits further improvement in the accuracy of measurements ; for instance in @xcite , it had been reported that the noise of a hemt - based cryogenic amplifier dominates 94 % of the total noise floor .",
    "to overcome such a limitation , a superconducting resonator connected to josephson junctions is a promising system , because of its ability to amplify signals with an ultimately lower noise . in previous studies @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "however , the main research interest in such a structure had been amplifying signals in the microwave frequency range , and not amplifying low - frequency current . in contrast , here we propose , based on a similar concept , a design of a cryogenic `` current '' amplifier in low - frequency range and analyze its electrical properties . as a result",
    ", we found that the estimated input - referred current noise of the proposed amplifier is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the conventional cryogenic current amplifier based on hemts or squids .",
    "our proposed amplifier consists of a half - wavelength coplanar waveguide resonator as schematically shown in fig .",
    "one end of the resonator is coupled to a transmission line used as an input - output port by the capacitor @xmath0 , while the other end is shunted by a series array of @xmath1 josephson junctions ( jj array ) . to utilize this structure as a current amplifier , a current input port is introduced at the middle of the resonator ( ` o ' in the figure ) .",
    "this input port has two branches ; the one is connected to a tunable current source so as to provide a constant bias current @xmath2 to the jj array ; while the other is connected to a device under test ( dut ) so that the current @xmath3 from the dut is fed into the jj array . in order to avoid an unwanted effect",
    "that microwave in the resonator influences the dut , the input port is placed at the position where the electric field of the relevant resonant mode is zero as depicted by the orange line in the figure . in addition , the input port is inductively isolated from the resonator by the inductors @xmath4 and @xmath5 so as to confine microwave exclusively inside the resonator .",
    "since the kinetic inductance of the josephson junctions depends on the total current @xmath6 flowing through the junctions , the resonator s mode also depends on the current . hence measuring frequency response of the resonator allows the current @xmath3 to be measured .",
    "to analyze frequency response of the proposed amplifier , we consider the equivalent circuit shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) . in this model , the input - output port and the resonator",
    "are represented by transmission lines of a characteristic impedance @xmath7 .",
    "meanwhile , the jj array is described by a single resistively capacitively shunted junction model ( rcsj model ) @xcite , since the size of the jj array , estimated to be tens of micrometers , is negligibly smaller than the typical wave - length of the resonant mode , estimated to be ten millimeters . the net junction resistance @xmath8 ( junction capacitance @xmath9 ) of the jj array is given by @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) with @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) of the individual junction .",
    "similarly , the net kinetic inductance @xmath14 of the jj array , which depends on @xmath15 , is given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the elementary charge , planck constant @xmath21 divided by @xmath22 , and the critical current , respectively @xcite .",
    "in addition , the current @xmath23 is represented by a current source parallel to the jj array .",
    "we simulate the frequency response of the resonator by calculating the telegrapher s equation with the boundary condition described by the rcsj model @xcite . throughout the calculation",
    ", we use the parameters : @xmath24 @xmath25 , @xmath26 k@xmath25 , @xmath27 ff , @xmath28 na , and @xmath29 ff , determined with reference to the practical experiments @xcite .",
    "the resonant frequency of the fundamental mode is designed at 8.1 ghz , because it is easily measured in experiments . on the other hand , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and the input microwave power @xmath30",
    "are varied so as to find the optimal conditions .",
    "figures 2(a ) and ( b ) show the frequency response [ ( a ) @xmath31 and ( b ) phase shift @xmath32 around the resonant frequency @xmath33 ghz of the fundamental mode with two different current conditions @xmath34 and @xmath35 na at @xmath36 . as expected , the resonant frequency is shifted by a change in @xmath15 . in particular , the phase of the reflected microwave is very sensitive to a change in @xmath15 as being suggested by the comparison between @xmath37 rad / na and @xmath38 at the on - resonant frequency ( the vertical dotted lines in the figures ) .",
    "so , in the present paper , we focus on the situation that the current input to the amplifier is measured through a phase measurement of the reflected microwave . to obtain larger current - to - phase transduction",
    ", the bias current @xmath2 should be carefully optimized .",
    "figure 2(c ) shows @xmath39-dependence of current - phase transfer function @xmath40 , showing that @xmath40 is enhanced as @xmath2 approaches @xmath20 . in what follows ,",
    "we fix @xmath41 na .",
    "figure 2(d ) shows the amount of phase shift @xmath42 as a function of @xmath15 with two cases @xmath36 and @xmath43 , showing that @xmath15-dependence of @xmath42 with @xmath43 is larger than the case with @xmath36 as expected from the fact that the net kinetic inductance @xmath44 can be enhanced with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the linearity in the current - phase relation is also satisfied up to @xmath45 na in the both cases .     and",
    "@xmath35 na .",
    "( a ) @xmath31 and ( b ) phase shift @xmath42 .",
    "( c ) the current - phase transfer function @xmath40 as a function of @xmath39 with @xmath36 .",
    "( d ) @xmath15-dependence of the phase shift @xmath42 in the frequency response of the resonator at the on - resonant frequency with @xmath46 and @xmath47 . ]    the input - referred current noise of the amplifier is estimated by considering two different origins of noise , i.e.  electric noise generated at the jj array and phase noise added to the frequency response .",
    "first , with regard to the former origin , we consider thermal noise and electron shot noise generated at the jj array . the thermal noise is estimated from the johnson - nyquist relation @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the boltzmann constant , while the electron shot noise is estimated from @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the time - averaged current driven by the resonant microwave @xcite .",
    "note here that @xmath52 , which is a high - frequency excess current carried by quasiparticles , differs from @xmath2 or @xmath3 , which is a low - frequency supercurrent carried by the cooper pairs and does not generate the electron shot noise @xcite .",
    "second , with regard to the latter origin , we consider optical shot noise and quantum noise @xcite .",
    "the optical shot noise , which is associated with stochastic fluctuations in the photon number , is estimated from @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the voltage amplitude of the reflected microwave .",
    "the quantum noise is also estimated from the similar form @xmath55 . to quantify the input - referred value",
    ", the estimated phase noise should be converted to the corresponding current at the input via @xmath40 .",
    "we note that the validity of the above estimations was confirmed by checking the agreement of their values with the actual experiments for instance in @xcite .",
    "figures 3(b ) and ( c ) show the estimated input - referred current noise @xmath56 as a function of the input microwave power @xmath30 with ( b ) @xmath36 and ( c ) @xmath47 . in the figures ,",
    "the electron shot noise , optical shot noise and quantum noise are explicitly shown as dashed lines , while the thermal noise is not since its value is negligibly small when the system temperature is @xmath57 mk ( typical temperatures in a dilution refrigerator ) . as expected , the total noise with @xmath43 is lower than that with @xmath36 .     driven by the input microwave as a function of its power . ( b ) and ( c )",
    "the input refereed current noise of the amplifier with ( b ) @xmath46 and ( c ) @xmath47 . ]",
    "figure 3(b ) and ( c ) show the minimum @xmath58 at @xmath59 w , which reflects the fact that the total noise is comprised of both monotonically decreasing ( optical shot noise and quantum noise ) and increasing ( electron shot noise ) components with the input rf power . in order to determine the optimal value of the input rf power",
    ", we should take into account the possibility that a larger @xmath52 drives the jj array into the so - called `` voltage state '' and then the amplifier loses its function .",
    "to avoid such a situation , the input rf power should be low enough so that the total current @xmath60 is kept below @xmath20 . since @xmath61 na in the present analysis has a 5 na margin to @xmath20 ( @xmath62 na ) ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath63 na should at least be satisfied . the square ( circle )",
    "symbol on the trace in fig .",
    "3(b ) [ ( c ) ] indicates the rf power at which @xmath64 na in each @xmath1 as indicated by the corresponding symbols in fig .",
    "so the rf power should be lower than these points . in the case with @xmath43 [ fig .",
    "3(c ) ] , the input - referred current noise is of the order of @xmath65 - @xmath66 @xmath67 at a power range @xmath68 w. these noises are two orders of magnitude smaller than that with the conventional cryogenic current amplifiers based on the hemts or squids , whose noise floors are typically of the order of @xmath69 - @xmath70 @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "this improvement in the noise floor allows us to measure the power spectrum of the current from a dut with an unprecedentedly better signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "in conclusion , we designed a new type of cryogenic current amplifiers , in which the power spectrum of current can be measured through a phase measurement of the superconducting resonator shunted by the jj array . from the numerical analysis on the equivalent circuit , the input - referred current noise of the amplifier",
    "is found to be two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the conventional cryogenic amplifiers .",
