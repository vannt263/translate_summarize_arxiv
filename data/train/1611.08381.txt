    "the acceleration of protons by intense laser pulses is still the subject of active experimental investigation .",
    "the most consolidated regime is the tnsa , where the electrons , heated by laser , diffuse and leave the target creating an electric field which accelerates the surface protons present in the contaminants . the comparison with current pic simulations is still affected by uncertainties .",
    "indeed the energy spectra are found to be exponential with a cut - off @xmath3 but the cut - off energy @xmath4 and the average energy value @xmath5 ( proton temperature ) depend on time . in 2d pic tnsa simulations , a monotonic rise of @xmath4 with time",
    "is observed whereas in 3d a slow trend towards a possible saturation to an asymptotic value is usually observed . as a consequence ,",
    "a comparison of 2d and 3d simulations is difficult , since the laws of the cut - off energy rise with time @xmath6 appear to be different .    in this paper",
    "we try to give a phenomenological answer to this question , by proposing two empirical laws for @xmath6 , suggested by a model firstly proposed by schreiber et al .",
    "@xcite , to describe the dependence of the cut - off energy from the laser pulse duration .",
    "this model assumes that the hot electron cloud leaves the rear side of the target , creating a surface density of positive charge , whose electric field accelerates the protons belonging to the contaminants .",
    "we have considered a 2d model in which the surface charge is on a strip with infinite length and height @xmath7 , with @xmath8 corresponding to the laser waist , and a 3d model in which the surface charge is located on a disc of radius @xmath8 . in our model ,",
    "the laser is assumed to have normal incidence on the target and in figure 1 we sketch the geometric configurations .",
    "the numerical analysis presented here refers to a laser pulse with @xmath9 fs and @xmath0 .",
    "this choice was made because , recently , systematic experiments with such a laser pulse were carried out at ilil in pisa @xcite . besides , several experiments with similar parameters , which ensure the acceleration regime is tnsa , are present in the literature . for an overview on the physics of the proton acceleration by high intensity lasers and related experiments ,",
    "we refer to recent reviews @xcite . in the considered intensity range",
    ", experimental results concerning the dependence on the target thickness , the incidence angle and the temporal contrast are described in many papers @xcite .",
    "when the contrast is very high , the cut - off energy varies monotonically with target thickness and if the contrast were infinite this behaviour would be observed , until the radiation pressure becomes dominant by approaching the relativistic transparency limit .",
    "when the contrast is finite , as in experiments , a maximum in the cut - off energy @xmath4 is reached at a certain minimum thickness . by further reducing thickness , a rapid decrease to zero of @xmath4",
    "is observed , due to the increasing damage on the foil induced by the prepulse .",
    "a significant dependence on the incidence angle is also observed and typically the proton cut - off energy increases with the angle up to a maximum value , because the electrons are heated more efficiently @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the preplasma is neglected ( the temporal contrast is assumed as infinite ) . because of this choice , amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) prepulse is not permitted .",
    "on the other hand , prepulse coming from compression artefacts ( ps time scale ) can be tolerated when comparing our simulation results with experiments , as long as the plasma preformed on the illuminated side of the target has a scale length much shorter than the laser wavelength .",
    "the 2d and 3d simulations were carried out with the code @xcite and the asymptotic cut - off energy @xmath10 was determined by a best - fit procedure on its time dependence , following the laws obtained from the electrostatic model , which just depend on two parameters : the asymptotic cut - off energy @xmath10 and the rise time @xmath11 , which is the time when the energy starts to rise .    beyond the good agreement of the asymptotic cut - off energies obtained from 2d and 3d simulations ,",
    "the monotonic dependence on the incidence angle and the target thickness was found in qualitative agreement with the experimental results for high contrast pulses .    in our 3d simulations ,",
    "the transverse section of the computational box is the same as the target , whose extension is comparable with the focal spot ( four times bigger ) measured by the waist . as a consequence , a leakage of electrons from the computational box occurs and when the fraction of lost electrons becomes appreciable , typically for @xmath12 significantly above @xmath13 m , the simulation looses reliability .",
    "that is why we stop our analysis at this time .",
    "increasing the box size would enable us to go further , but without adding any insightful detail .",
    "our method allows us to limit the simulation even to @xmath14 m using small boxes , since the results are already stable and comparable with 3d results . here we present the results for a single laser pulse and various target thicknesses , to assess the validity of our model , even though we have started a more extensive exploration by varying the laser duration , its intensity and the metal target electron density .",
    "a detailed analysis of the dependence of @xmath10 and @xmath11 on laser and target parameters will give us a better insight , but , from the encouraging results obtained so far , we can conclude that the simple method we propose here appears to be adequate to extract the asymptotic cut - off energy from pic simulations .",
    "starting from the 3d case and considering a laser pulse which propagates along the @xmath15 axis , we choose an electrostatic potential which vanishes at @xmath16 , where the surface charge ( density @xmath17 ) is located .",
    "this potential is given by @xmath18 asymptotically , for @xmath19 , it behaves as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the charge on the disc .",
    "a particle initially at rest accelerates and the law of motion is obtained from energy conservation . since @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 letting @xmath24 , the kinetic energy of the particle , after integrating the equation of motion , is @xmath25 where @xmath26 since this is an asymptotic law , we may assume that @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "notice that @xmath29 is the highest energy reached at time @xmath30 , namely @xmath31 .",
    "in this case we have a infinite strip along the @xmath32 axis with uniform charge density on @xmath33 . a potential that vanishes at @xmath16",
    "is given by @xmath34 where we defined @xmath35 . to obtain this result , it is simpler to compute first the electric field @xmath36 , whose asymptotic behaviour is @xmath37 . as a consequence ,",
    "a potential having this asymptotic behaviour and which vanishes at the origin is @xmath38 .",
    "the potential in this case diverges logarithmically and consequently the particle accelerates indefinitely .",
    "we approximate the potential energy with @xmath39 we may then easily solve the equations of motion from energy conservation , assuming the proton initially at rest in the origin as for the 3d case .",
    "the result is ( see appendix for more details ) @xmath40 again , since this is an asymptotic law , we may assume that @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "even though the models we propose are very simple , we tried to see whether the predicted asymptotic laws for @xmath41 hold for pic simulations .",
    "the answer is positive , at least for targets consisting of a uniform foil whose thickness is in the micrometer range , covered by a thin layer of contaminants . for this type of targets ,",
    "the fits , both for 2d and 3d pic simulations , are surprisingly accurate .",
    "however , the asymptotic energy @xmath10 and the time scale @xmath11 in 2d and 3d must be considered fitting parameters , even though the results we obtain have the correct order of magnitude with respect to the theoretical results .",
    "the law to be fitted for 2d simulations is @xmath42 we perform a linear fit by defining @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so that the previous law becomes @xmath45    the law to be fitted for 3d simulations is @xmath46 we can perform a linear fit by defining @xmath47 and @xmath48 , so that the previous law becomes @xmath49",
    "we have considered the following model : the laser pulse has wavelength @xmath50 m , intensity @xmath51 w/@xmath52 , waist 6.2 @xmath53 m , p - polarization and its duration is 40 fs .",
    "the corresponding normalized vector potential is @xmath0 .",
    "the target is a uniform al foil of thickness @xmath1 varying between 0.5 and 8 @xmath53 m , having a layer of hydrogen on the rear ( non illuminated ) side , with fixed thickness @xmath54 m .",
    "the ionization level is al@xmath55 and h@xmath56 and it is fixed throughout the simulation .",
    "the electron densities have been chosen as @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for a al foil ,",
    "whose thickness is in the @xmath59\\,\\mu$]m range , we expect that the process is dominated by tnsa ( we are well beyond the transparency limit ) .",
    "the collisional models have been neglected in our simulations .    in figure [ fig:2 ]",
    "we show the results obtained from 2d simulations for @xmath60 , by plotting @xmath61 in a linear and a logarithmic scale for @xmath12 with the corresponding fits .",
    "initially , the time at which the energy starts to rise is almost independent from the thickness @xmath62 m . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we quote the results of the fit : we notice that @xmath63 . in figure [ fig:3 ]",
    "we resume the dependence of the cut - off energy on the thickness . in figure [ fig:4 ]",
    "we show the results of 2d simulations obtained when the incidence angle is small but different from zero : the logarithmic growth in @xmath12 is still present and the linear fits are quite good , see also table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "we present now the results for some 3d simulations , precisely with @xmath64 m . in figure",
    "[ fig:5 ] we show the curves corresponding to a linear fit to @xmath65 versus @xmath66 .",
    "the asymptotic values @xmath67 and the fitting curves up to @xmath68 m are shown in the left panel figure [ fig:5 ] .    we notice that , even though the extrapolated data from the 2d and 3d simulations are not the same , the correspondence is quite reasonable . in table [ tab:1 ] the numerical results are quoted and in any case the discrepancy does not exceed 20% . we may observe that the energy for @xmath69 m in the 2d simulation is very close to the extrapolated value , due to the logarithmic growth . in table",
    "[ tab:2 ] we report the numerical results about the @xmath10 obtained for three different incidence angles @xmath70 and target thickness @xmath71 m . in 3d at @xmath69",
    "m the energy value is less than one half of the extrapolated value @xmath10 due to the slower rise , see table [ tab:3 ] . in this case",
    "there is an asymptotic limit , which is reached quite far , when @xmath72 m .",
    "such a large value is computationally too expensive to be attained .",

    "the cut - off energy increases as the target thickness is reduced , until the effect of finite contrast prevails inverting the trend .",
    "the results of various experiments differ by more than a factor two , but the decreasing trend is similar and the same behaviour can be seen in the 2d and 3d pic simulations .",

    "the asymptotic value of the cut - off energy of protons , which is what is measured in experiments , is difficult to extract from pic simulations . indeed , the 2d results do not exhibit a saturation , whereas the 3d results show that a saturation might be reached , despite at a large time ( @xmath72 m ) , which is computationally too expensive to be reached .",

    ", we believe that , for the targets that we analysed , in which the protons are only on the thin layer above the bulk , the proposed phenomenological model is adequate to avoid the arbitrariness in the choice of the time at which the asymptotic cut - off energy is chosen usually in numerical simulations . in addition , the parametric explorations , which can be carried out only in 2d , may have a quantitative value , with an adequate extrapolation , rather than being of purely qualitative nature .",
