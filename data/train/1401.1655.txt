    "potential theory has been proved very successfully in solving some boundary value problems such as the dirichlet and the neumann problems or the electrostatic charge distribution on conductors . for domains with sufficiently smooth boundaries ( i.e. , a regular piecewise lyapunov surface ) the above problems use specific types of potentials like the volume , the single- , and the double - layer potentials , the logarithmic potential for two - dimensional domains , etc . @xcite . the dirichlet and neumann problems defined on domains with sufficiently smooth boundaries can be recast in integral equations which lead to compact operators on domain boundary : the neumann - poincar ( or double - layer ) operator and its adjoint @xcite .",
    "these methods are applied in some practical and physical problems regarding dielectric heterogeneous systems like the radio - frequency and microwave dielectric spectra of living cells @xcite and plasmonic properties of metallic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "another problem is the equilibrium charge distribution on a conductor ( the robin problem ) @xcite and the implicit capacitance with applications in computational biophysics @xcite , in scanning probe microscopy @xcite , or in electrical charge storage in supercapacitors @xcite .",
    "the capacitance of an arbitrarily shaped body is calculated by `` mimicking '' some directly related phenomena like the diffusion - controlled reactions @xcite or the ergodic generation of the equilibrium charge distribution @xcite .",
    "the standard procedures for solving the laplace equation are the finite element method ( fem ) @xcite or the boundary integral equation ( bie ) method with the finite element formulation as the boundary element method ( bem ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the fem , in the bem only the surfaces of the inclusions are discretized , such that with numerical algorithms like the fast multipole method ( fmm ) of rokhlin and greengard @xcite the calculations are essentially of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of nodes . the capacitance of an arbitrary object has been treated in different contexts with @xmath0 fmm schemes ( see ref . and the references therein ) .",
    "it can be treated as a first- @xcite or as a second - kind integral equation .",
    "the second - kind integral formulation is based either on the neumann - poincar operator @xcite or on its adjoint@xcite .",
    "the most convenient approach is , however , the second - kind integral equation with the adjoint of the neumann - poincar operator which provides both the charge density and the capacitance @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we adopt such a bie method to calculate the capacitance and the equilibrium charge on an arbitrarily shaped object with several applications . the capacitance is obtained concurrently with other physical properties like the static and the dynamic polarizabilities of nanoparticles with applications in nanoparticle manipulation @xcite and plasmonics @xcite .",
    "we use a spectral method @xcite which provides an exponential convergence @xcite .",
    "moreover , our basis functions include spherical harmonics @xcite that can be directly related with the multipoles in the fmm of rokhlin @xcite . compared to others the present method shows directly that the geometric dependence of capacitance is incorporated in a norm of a given eigenvector of the neumann - poincar operator .",
    "this eigenvector norm varies slowly with the geometry hence two scale - invariant defined shape factors can be readily used in the estimation of capacitance for arbitrary shapes .",
    "furthermore , we define a specific class of capacitors in which the electrodes are the equipotential surfaces generated by the equilibrium charge on an arbitrarily shaped metallic object with applications regarding some analytical results like confocal spheroidal capacitors and finite cylinders . we also provide a second order compact capacitance formula for thin and constant - thickness capacitors with other applications referring to membrane capacitance of living cells and charge storage in supercapacitors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we define the capacitance in the second - kind integral form .",
    "then , we define a general capacitor and a specific class of capacitors in the following section .",
    "section 4 describes the numerical method and the applications just mentioned above .",
    "a summary is given in the last section .",
    "we assume an arbitrarily shaped domain @xmath2 bounded by the surface @xmath3 in the 3-dimensional space .",
    "the following operators can be defined on @xmath3 : @xmath4 , its adjoint @xmath5 , and @xmath6.@xcite the action of @xmath4 on a function @xmath7 signifies the normal electric field to @xmath8 generated by the charge density @xmath7 . the operator @xmath9 , which is the neumann - poincar ( or double - layer ) operator , acts on the dipole density @xmath10 generating an electric potential on @xmath8 . on the other hand , @xmath6 is a coulomb ( single - layer ) operator which acts on the charge density @xmath7 creating an electric potential on @xmath8 .",
    "the operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 have the same spectrum within @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the eigenfunctions @xmath13 of @xmath4 are related to the eigenfunctions @xmath14 of @xmath5 by @xmath15 $ ] , which makes them bi - orthogonal , i.e. , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is 1/2 irrespective of the domain shape @xcite and the corresponding eigenfunction @xmath17 of @xmath18 is a constant function , i. e. , @xmath19constant on @xmath3 . as we will discuss below , the companion eigenfunction",
    "@xmath20 of @xmath4 is proportional to the equilibrium charge distribution on a conductor of shape determined by @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the spectrum of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is scale invariant , but the spectrum of @xmath6 is proportional to the linear size of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath6 can be used in the resolution of many physical problems like the static @xcite or the dynamic object polarizability represented by the dielectric spectra of living cells @xcite or the optical properties of metallic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "another closely related issue is the robin problem of finding the equilibrium charge distribution @xmath21 on a conductor of arbitrary shape @xcite .",

    ". then we can relate @xmath34 to the norm of @xmath17 by the following chain of equations @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the area of @xmath3 .",
    "finally , the capacitance takes a simple and compact form @xmath38 one can show that @xmath39 is proportional to the linear size of @xmath2 therefore , the capacitance itself is also proportional to the linear size of the body .",
    "equation ( [ eq2 ] ) shows explicitly both the geometric dependence of capacitance of an arbitrarily shaped object and the scale invariance of the shape factor @xmath40 .",
    "the shape factor varies slowly with the conductor shape @xcite hence , as we will discuss in the next section , @xmath39 is a slowly varying function of the conductor shape and perturbative estimations of capacitance can be performed .",

    "in contrast , @xmath172 is the capacitance when the two particles are charged with opposite charges @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "it logarithmically diverges as the spheres approach the touching point @xcite since the charging mode transforms into a dipole - active mode .",
    "this behavior of @xmath171 and @xmath172 is expected to hold for dimers of any shape as it has been recently found for ellipsoidal @xcite or other , more general @xcite , shaped dimers .",

    "another application is the estimation of capacitance in thin capacitors like the membrane capacitance in living cells .",
    "the shelled ellipsoidal model and the spheroidal model , in particular , are two of the most common models of living cells used in modeling the dielectric spectroscopy experiments . in the spheroidal shelled model the shell designates the cell membrane , which is practically non - conductive and bounded by two confocal spheroids .",
    "both the spherical @xcite and the spheroidal @xcite models have analytical solutions for @xmath175-(below the frequency of 10 khz ) and @xmath176- ( in the mhz range of the radiofrequency spectrum ) relaxations @xcite . on the other hand , the membrane capacitance needs to be estimated as an input parameter in the analysis of @xmath175- and @xmath176-relaxations @xcite .",
    "( [ eqprolcapacitor ] ) gives us also an analytical form of the membrane capacitance in the spheroidal model , putting the ellipsoidal and the spherical models on the same footing in terms of solvability .",
    "however , realistic cell models would imply constant - thickness membrane , which is not found in the spheroidal model . in living cells , on the other hand ,",
    "the membrane is very just a few tens of @xmath177 thick for a cell size in the @xmath178 range .",
    "apparently , eq . ( [ eqthincapacitor ] ) is quite general for thin capacitors .",
    "the control parameter for accuracy is @xmath82 which is weighted by its lam coefficient .",
    "thus , it is of great interest to look for the validity of ( [ eqthincapacitor ] ) in the case of thin and constant - thickness capacitors .",
    "we suppose that @xmath93 is sufficiently smooth and let us pick an arbitrary point @xmath179 on @xmath93 that is locally parametrized by @xmath180 and consider its two principal directions in which the curvature tensor is diagonal .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that @xmath82 is the parameterization of the first principal direction and @xmath83 the parameterization of the second .",
    "we further assume that the unit tangent vectors are @xmath181 , such that the surface element is @xmath182 . hence , the unit normal vector on @xmath63 at @xmath179 is @xmath183 .",
    "we also denote the curvature along the first principal direction at @xmath179 as @xmath184 and the curvature along the second principal direction at @xmath179 as @xmath185 . in this situation",
    "the constant - thickness capacitor is determined by @xmath63 and by @xmath78 that is defined as @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the is small and constant .",
    "then the tangent vectors on @xmath78 are @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , in the linear approximation with respect to @xmath189 , the surface element on @xmath78 is @xmath190 , with the mean curvature @xmath191 .",
    "the key approximation that comes under scrutiny is eq .",
    "( [ eqdeltapotential ] ) , which is valid as long as the electric field on @xmath78 is the same as the electric field on @xmath63 . according to the gauss theorem the product of electric field and",
    "the surface element must be constant . in the linear approximation with respect to @xmath189 the field @xmath192 on @xmath78",
    "is @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the field on @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , it is not hard to see that the voltage drop @xmath195 must be amended by the factor @xmath196 and eq .",
    "( [ eqdeltapotential ] ) must be changed to @xmath197 eq .",
    "( [ eqthincapacitor2 ] ) is a second order approximation of thin constant - thickness , where the first term on the right - hand side is the leading term .",
    "we have two straighforward consequences .",
    "first , eq .",
    "( [ eqthincapacitor2 ] ) explains why the capacitance of cell membranes appear to be much larger whenever the membrane is folded @xcite .",
    "second , it gives us also the validity criterion of parallel - plane capacitor - like formula which is @xmath198 in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] we present the percentage error of the planar - like capacitor formula , eq.([eqthincapacitor ] ) , with respect to full numerical calculations and with respect to eq .",
    "( [ eqthincapacitor2 ] ) for thin constant - thickness capacitors of prolate spheroidal shape .",
    "three thicknesses are considered : 0.1 , 0.05 , and 0.01 of the largest axial cross - sectional radius of the spheroid .",
    "the calculations show that eq .",
    "( [ eqthincapacitor2 ] ) is a good approximation of constant - thickness capacitors up to significant thichnesses . on the other hand , for extremely thin capacitors (",
    "a thickness of 0.01 ) the error of eq.([eqthincapacitor ] ) is about @xmath199 .    a useful application of eq . ( [ eqthincapacitor2 ] )",
    "is the assessment of the geometry - dependent energy storage in supercapacitors . in a recent paper huang et al .",
    "@xcite noticed that the normalized capacitance ( capacitance per unit area ) of spherical and cylindrical double - layer capacitors increase with decreasing sphere and cylinder diameters .",
    "they also noticed that the capacitances of spherical capacitors increase faster than that of cylinders and argued that this behavior is related to the principal curvatures of those shapes @xcite .",
    "( [ eqthincapacitor2 ] ) provides not only the proof for the curvature - related capacitance but also a quantitative evaluation of shape dependent capacitance . in addition , the same equation can be utilized for double - layer capacitors of arbitrary shapes .",
    "in the second - kind integral equation based on the adjoint of the neumann - poincar operator the capacitance as well as the static and dynamic polarizabilities can be simultaneously calculated for arbitrarily shaped objects .",
    "a compact capacitance formula is obtained and is simply stated as follows .",
    "the capacitance is direct proportional to the dielectric permittivity of the embedding medium and to the area of the object , and inverse proportional to the squared norm of the eigenfunction of the neumann - poincar operator with the largest eigenvalue .",
    "a spectral based numerical implementation of the method is accurate and resembles the fast multipole method .",
    "several applications are discussed .",
    "the capacitance formula allows us to define scale - invariant shape factors that varies slowly with shape and can be used in approximate calculations of capacitance .",
    "we have analyzed two scale - invariant shape factors .",
    "one of the shape factors employs the volume of the object and is more suitable for long shapes like rods or wires .",
    "the other shape factor , which is defined in terms of the object area , is more appropriate for objects with shapes close to a sphere .",
    "both scale - invariant shape factors , however , provide an accurate capacitance of touching metallic dimers .",
    "we have extended the above results to capacitors .",
    "more explicitly , we have considered a special class of capacitors defined by the equipotential surfaces of the equilibrium charge on an arbitrarly shaped body . in this case",
    "the capacitor behaves like a series capacitor with the total capacitance as being the capacitance of the inner surface in series with the opposite ( negative ) capacitance of the outer surface of the capacitor .",
    "this result leads to an integral form of capacitance that was used to estimate analytically the capacitance of confocal spheroidal capacitors and of finite cylinders .",
    "another consequence is a second - order formula for thin constant - thickness capacitors of arbitrary shape .",
    "the first order term has a plane - capacitor like form , while the second order term is the surface integral of the mean curvature .",
    "applications of a thin constant - thickness capacitor formula are encountered in the capacitance estimation of membrane in living cells and of supercapacitors with arbitrary shapes ."
