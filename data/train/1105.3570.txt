    "usually the electronic spectra of coupled qds are measured as a function of gate voltages .",

    "the conversion from gate voltages to energy can be achieved by comparison with a known external energy scale .",

    "fortunately , charge fluctuations can still be measured , e.g. , using a capacitively coupled quantum point contact ( qpc ) as a charge detector.@xcite with this technique it is even possible to detect extremely small currents through an almost pinched - off double qd indirectly by recording tunneling processes in real time.@xcite this counting method is demanding , though , as it needs a special setup , including a low - noise high - bandwidth detector .",
    "a more basic procedure which can be conducted with a standard experimental setup would be desirable .",
    "it is possible to extract energy scales from the thermal broadening of the transitions between different charge configurations in the stability diagram of coupled qds @xcite in an elaborate procedure .",
    "this method requires a small tunnel coupling to guarantee that the line shapes are determined by thermal broadening . in an appropriate radio - frequency setup and a double qd with suitable tunnel couplings",
    "photon - assisted tunneling can be used for energy calibration since the photon energy provides the external energy scale.@xcite    most energy calibration methods including the aforementioned ones either require special experimental setups or a narrow regime of tunnel couplings of the qds . in practice",
    "the conversion factors are often determined once in a rather open double qd by measuring nonlinear transport , and are then still used after tuning the coupled qds to rather small tunnel couplings . in this article",
    "we show that such an approach leads to inaccuracies that can be avoided .",
    "we present several methods to acquire conversion factors , valid for different coupling regimes , which are accurate as well as straightforward to implement .",
    "the discussion here is limited to double qd systems with rather weak tunnel coupling between the two qds which , incidentally , have a very large resistance compared to the lead resistances ; the latter can thus be neglected .",

    "[ fig_backaction](b ) , though . most of the charging lines visible in fig.[fig_backaction](a ) are resonances with the left ( drain ) lead since the left tunnel barrier is reasonably low . in the vicinity of the triple points ( @xmath48 )",
    "charging of the right qd occurs from the left ( drain ) lead in an elastic cotunneling process via the left qd . the charging line belonging to the transition @xmath49 is discontinuous , however ,",
    "as further away from the triple point the cotunneling rate quickly decreases and the right qd can be charged more efficiently from the right - hand side ( source ) lead via the large tunnel barrier .",

    "[ fig_sample ]  [ fig_backaction ] have all been measured within the same cooling run on the same sample .",
    "the main difference between those measurements is that the double qd is tuned to slightly different geometries by varying the gate voltages @xmath56 and @xmath57 as shown in table [ tab_results ] ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 are kept constant ) .",
    "for instance the conversion factors of fig .",
    "[ fig_backaction ] are up to 62 % higher than those of fig.[fig_sample ] . we conclude that the capacitances between gates and the qds depend on the detailed qd geometries which are strongly affected by the applied gate voltages .",

    "[ fig_sample ] .",
    "this discrepancy is caused by the difficulty and according inaccuracy in determining the size of the current - carrying triangle in fig .",
    "[ fig_sample ] , since the observed size depends on the sensitivity of the current measurement .",
    "this causes a systematic error in @xmath34 which is not included in the error value given in table [ tab_results ] .",
    "in addition , in a current measurement the size of the bias triangle is influenced by the width of the transitions between the different charge configurations ( i.e. , the width of the charging lines in a charge measurements ) which depends on the tunnel couplings .",
    "the accuracy is much higher for charge detection , where @xmath34 can be determined by using the center of the charging lines independent of their width .",

    "a larger portion of a charge stability diagram ( measured using charge detection ) is shown which features all of the effects described in sections [ sec_charge][sec_backaction ] as the ratio between the relevant tunnel couplings varies throughout the stability diagram as a function of the plunger gate voltages .",
    "for this measurement the double qd has been tuned rather asymmetrically , similar to the configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig_backaction ] , and the feature visible in the latter graph reoccurs here as the electron numbers change from 1/1 to 2/2 .",

    "our calibration methods fail and the conversion factors have to be estimated by extrapolation from other areas of the stability diagram . calibration methods which need specific experimental setups might still work ( compare sec .",
    "[ sec_introduction ] ) .",
    "all calibration methods described so far rely on distinct features that appear in the stability diagram as a finite but fixed bias @xmath3  is applied .",

    "the observed shift is therefore not a direct measure of @xmath69 .",
    "it is much smaller than expected from the applied bias @xmath3  because of a compensation related to the electrostatic coupling between the qds , the gates , and the leads . as pointed out with this example ,",
    "relying solely on changes in the charging line positions is not suitable to obtain a valid calibration .",
    "instead , we used features that show transitions from source to drain resonances .",
    "we have described several methods of obtaining the conversion factors between gate voltages and chemical potentials in a double qd system in the few - electron regime . depending on the specific couplings and tunneling rates in the system ,",
    "different phenomena are observed in the charge stability diagram as a bias is applied across the double qd , and most of them can be harnessed to determine the conversion factors . even for a very asymmetric system , a calibration procedure has been developed .",
    "the latter method might gain significance if the number of quantum dot in series is increased , as additional qds tend to act in the same way as large barriers when in coulomb blockade .",
    "the procedure might therefore be extended to few - electron triple qd circuits which include a charge detector@xcite .",
