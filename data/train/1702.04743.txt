    "charge density waves ( cdws ) are broken symmetry states of low - dimensional metals , induced by the e - p interaction ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the cdw ground - states generally compete with other electronic instabilities , such as superconductivity , spin density waves , or excitonic insulators . for that reason ,",
    "it remains essential to understand their origin and their physical properties .",
    "many experiments show evidences of strong e - p coupling in a lot of one and two - dimensional cdw systems @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the new quasi two - dimensional rare - earth tritellurides ( rete@xmath0 , where re@xmath1rare - earth ) appear nowadays among the most convaincing . for this family of compounds and in the low temperature cdw state , the ratio of the electronic gap @xmath2 to the critical temperature @xmath3 is about @xmath4 @xcite , which is more than 4 times the predicted weak coupling value which is @xmath5 .",
    "the modulation function of the cdw has also been experimentally studied in details for these compounds @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the function has nothing to do with the weak coupling prediction , i.e. a simple cosine - like modulation .",
    "on the contrary , discontinuities appear in this function , indicating the formation of local bonds , oligomers and discommensurations as expected in the strong coupling theory @xcite .",
    "the kohn anomaly @xcite in the phonon spectrum also do not behave as expected by the weak coupling theory .",
    "the spectrum was measured by inelastic x - rays @xcite .",
    "a gap of about @xmath6mev persists in the low temperature phase although the compound is incommensurate .",
    "moreover , the softening of the phonons is large and spreads out over a large part of the brillouin zone indicating a strong e - p interaction @xcite .    at low temperatures , the cdws in the quasi - one dimensional compounds nbse@xmath0 , tas@xmath0 , a@xmath7moo@xmath0",

    "all the available theories of the electrical depinning of incommensurate cdws are build within the weak e - p coupling scheme . in this framework ,",
    "the residual impurities are the unique source of pinning , commensurability effects being negligible in these compounds .",
    "by contrast , at strong coupling , it is the lattice itself which is the main source of the cdw pinning .",
    "aubry et al .",
    "@xcite showed that there is a pinning / depinning transition as a function of the strength of the e - p interaction in incommensurate peierls chains .",
    "this pinning mechanism is intimately related to the presence of discontinuities in the modulation function of the atomic positions . at weak coupling ,",
    "the continuity of this function assures the existence of the frhlich mode since the energy of the condensate remains independent of the cdw phase .",
    "owing to this frhlich mode , the cdw state remains metallic unless impurities pin the cdw phase . at strong coupling , discontinuities appear in the modulation function of the ground - state and the frhlich mode is lost , leading to a dielectric state , independently of the presence or not of impurities .",
    "importantly , the energy scales of the two different pinning mechanisms , due to the impurities at weak coupling , or due to the lattice at strong coupling are very different . in the first case ,",
    "the pinning energy at a bond length scale has been estimated to be of the order of @xmath12 ev @xcite . by contrast , the lattice pinning yields energies of the order of a few hundred kelvin ( i.e. @xmath13 ev ) at the same length scale @xcite .",
    "this makes a difference of several orders of magnitude in energy between both mechanisms .",
    "so far , a depinning mechanism under an electric field in the strong coupling framework is missing . in this letter",
    ", we propose to fill in this theoretical gap .",
    "we restrain ourselves in the paper to one - dimensional ( 1d ) peierls chains .",
    "more precisely , we consider a sample made of a three dimensional assembly of linear peierls chains , all oriented in the same direction .",
    "to illustrate our aim , we choose the sue - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite to describe a single chain ,    @xmath14    the first term is the electron hamiltonian , where @xmath15(respectively @xmath16 ) is the annihilation ( respectively creation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath17 at the @xmath18 site along the chain .",

    "we consider a chain of @xmath28 atoms with @xmath29 pairs of electrons ( i.e. @xmath29 electrons with spin up and @xmath29 electrons with spin down ) . if @xmath30 , we fix to @xmath31 the interatomic distance @xmath32 in the undistorded state .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 which minimizes the energy becomes @xmath34 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following dimensionless parameters and variables : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "state , which is the type of cdw state developed in the ssh model , the bond lengths @xmath41 are modulated .     and @xmath42 .",
    "the modulation function @xmath43 is continuous , indicating the existence of the frhlich mode .",

    "the modulation function is periodic , @xmath62 , @xmath63 . for two numbers @xmath29 and @xmath28 prime one to another , the function @xmath43 in the ground - state",

    "the parameter @xmath65 is the commensurability ratio of the considered peierls chain and is related to the fermi wave vector @xmath66 . for an incommensurate system , @xmath67 must be an irrational number .",

    "commensurability effects exponentially decreases with @xmath86",
    ". consequently , commensurate systems with commensurability order @xmath87 ( with @xmath88 and @xmath86 prime one to another ) are largely sufficient to study incommensurate systems .",
    "besides the modulation function , the calculation of the phonon spectrum in the cdw state is of prime importance since it can be experimentally measured by inelastic neutrons and/or inelastic x - rays studies .",
    "the eigenvalues and the eigenstates @xmath89 and eigenvectors @xmath90 for the phonons are obtained by diagonalization of the dynamical matrix @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",

    "however the sum in ( [ spectrum ] ) , whose terms are proportional to @xmath105 , is not convenient to represent the whole phonon spectrum since it strongly favorizes the low energy phonons . to get a better representation of the whole spectrum , we introduce the damped harmonic oscillator function , @xmath106    @xmath107 is a small empirical parameter ( @xmath108 ) which smoothes the discrete sum over @xmath109 .",
    "the function @xmath99 calculated by using ( [ poids ] ) behaves similarly to the true @xmath99 ( the phonons are at the same location in the plane @xmath110 ) but gives an homogeneous , temperature independent , mapping of the whole spectrum .",
    "it has been shown by le daeron and aubry @xcite that for a given irrational @xmath67 , it exists a finite e - p coupling @xmath111 , which separates the weak from the strong coupling regime .",

    "the figs.1 - 2 show the modulation function and the related phonon spectrum for @xmath113 for two e - p coupling values . at weak coupling fig.[fig.1 ] , the modulation function is continuous . owing to this continuity ,",
    "the condensate energy is independent of the cdw phase @xmath114 .",
    "the cdw is not pinned and is free to move . in this regime , the frhlich collective mode ( @xmath115 ) allows the transport of electrons .",
    "the related phonon spectrum develops a complete kohn anomaly with @xmath116 , and the softening of the phonons is restrained around @xmath45 .",
    "the original phonon branch is replaced around @xmath45 by a separated phason ( cdw phase excitation ) and amplitudon ( cdw amplitude excitation ) which may be observed on the spectrum . by contrast , at strong coupling ( fig.[fig.2 ] ) , the modulation function presents discontinuities .",
    "this is the signature of the lock in of the cdw phase , which is pinned by the lattice , although the system is incommensurate .",
    "the cdw is not free to move and the frhlich mode is lacking .",
    "the related phonon spectrum also shows a behavior different than in the weak coupling regime .",
    "first , there is an energy gap at @xmath45 in the spectrum : @xmath117 .",
    "second , the softening of the phonons concerns a large part of the brillouin zone around @xmath45 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these two properties : existence of a phonon gap at @xmath45 and a large spreading of the phonon softening over the brillouin zone have been observed for ( tase@xmath8)@xmath9i @xcite , but also for the re - te@xmath0 family @xcite and 2@xmath118-nbse@xmath9 @xcite . for nbse@xmath0 , no softening could be observed @xcite , and for k@xmath7moo@xmath0 a phonon gap persists below the transition temperature @xcite .",
    "all these experimental observations are in favor of the strong coupling regime .",
    "more details about the transition by breaking of analyticity may be found in @xcite .",
    "to understand how a cdw in the strong e - p regime may be depinned from the lattice by an electric field , we must take into account one of the most amazing experimental properties : the gigantic low frequency dielectric constants of cdw systems . in the microwave range of frequencies and below ( @xmath119mhz ) , all known incommensurate one - dimensional cdw compounds behave as dielectrics at low temperatures with dielectric constants as large as @xmath120 .",
    "we note that for the two - dimensional re - te@xmath0 family , such measurements in the microwave range are still lacking . in what follows , due to this dielectric behavior , we assume that the possible presence of free electrons ( even at @xmath50k which is the case for nbse@xmath0 and re - te@xmath0 ) is not sufficient to screen such a high polarization .",
    "we completely neglect their effect and treat the cdw states as pure dielectrics .",
    "since in the strong e - p coupling regime , the cdw is pinned by the lattice , each bond of the peierls chains polarizes under the action of an applied electric field @xmath121",
    ". the induced dipolar momentum of the bond between @xmath23 and @xmath24 atom may be written as @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the polarizability of the @xmath18 length .",
    "we do nt know the exact value of this quantity , but we can derive some general properties .",
    "first , it is important to emphasize that the typical polarizability of a bond is always very small @xmath124cm@xmath125/v @xcite .",
    "second , the polarizability of a given bond varies with its length , a property which is used in the semi - classical theory of the raman effect @xcite .",
    "third , in the ground - state ( i.e. @xmath126 ) , the bonds , whose lengths are given by the set @xmath127 do not carry any dipolar momentum .",
    "finally , one may expand the polarizability as a function of the bond length as    @xmath128    @xmath129 is a term which accounts for the ionic polarizability",
    ". it will not play any role in the following .",
    "@xmath130 is the variation of polarizability with the bond length variation .",
    "it may be estimated to about a few tens of @xmath131cm@xmath125/v per @xmath132 @xcite , i.e. @xmath133cm / v .",
    "its sign is of importance . since in the cdw state the electronic density participating to a given bond becomes larger when its length decreases , we assume that @xmath134 : a shorter bond gives a larger polarizability .",
    "we also need the density of bonds in the 3d compounds . on a single chain ,",
    "the mean distance @xmath135 between two consecutive atoms is of the order of a few @xmath132 .",
    "let us fix @xmath136 . for simplicity",
    ", we also assume that the atoms in the undistorded state ( above @xmath3 ) and in the two other directions are arranged in a cubic symmetry .",
    "the density of bonds oriented in the chains direction is thus @xmath137 .    in usual experimental settings for electrical measurements ,",
    "a voltage is applied to the cdw sample of length @xmath138 . in that case , the _ macroscopic _ field @xmath139 inside the sample is _",
    "imposed_. when such a macroscopic electric field is applied in the direction of the chains , _ all bonds along the chains in the sample polarize in the same direction_. for a given bond @xmath140 of a chosen ( central ) chain , the dipolar energy @xmath141 involved , which includes the dipole - dipole interactions , may be written as    @xmath142.\\ ] ]    the index @xmath143 runs for all the other bonds in the 3d sample .",
    "@xmath144 is the permittivity of the vacuum .",
    "@xmath145 , where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the cooordinates of the bonds @xmath140 and @xmath143 respectively .",
    "@xmath148 is the unit vector in the chain direction , and @xmath149 . in the mean field approximation",
    ", we may replace @xmath150 by its mean values @xmath151 for all @xmath152 .",
    "that leads to the well - known lorentz local field results @xcite , which , in a cubic symmetry , leads to    @xmath153    where @xmath29 is the sample polarization , which is related to the macroscopic field @xmath154 in the sample by @xmath155 . finally ,    @xmath156    owing to the very large dielectric constant @xmath157 of a cdw compound , _ the local field is orders of magnitude larger than the macroscopic field @xmath154 in the sample_. it is of the order of @xmath158v / m .",
    "for comparison , an electron at about 1@xmath132 creates a _ microscopic _ field @xmath159v / m .    in the following",
    "we argue that the forces created by this local field behave as pressure forces which are sufficient : i ) to induce a significant deformation of the cdw ; ii ) to close the discontinuities of the ground - state modulation function ; and finally iii ) to depin the cdw .",
    "let us estimate the dipolar momentum ( [ dipole ] ) and the energy ( [ energy_dipole ] ) involved under the local field .",
    "since @xmath160 , we obtain @xmath161 cm ( @xmath162 debye ) , by taking @xmath163v / cm , @xmath164 and @xmath165m@xmath166 . the resulting energy ( [ energy_dipole ] ) is @xmath167ev .",
    "this is roughly a few percents of the amplitude of the other terms involved in the original hamiltonian ( [ ssh_1 ] ) .",
    "it is sufficient to compete with them and to induce a small variation @xmath168 of the bond lengths .",
    "we may also estimate the order of magnitude of this variation . from ( [ dipole ] ) and ( [ polarizability ] ) , @xmath169 . with @xmath170cm / v ,",
    "we get a mean contraction of the bond lengths of @xmath171 .",
    "this is a piezoelectric effect . in reality",
    ", it can be observed only if one of the ends of the sample is free to move , otherwise the contraction of a part of a chain leads necessary to the stretching of the remaining part .",
    "that phenomenon may induce a supplementary long wavelength deformation of the cdw which is not included in our model ( the chains here are supposed free to contract ) .",
    "is is interesting to note that such a piezoelectric effect has been observed for tas@xmath0 with a very large piezoelectric constant @xmath172 cm / v @xcite . within our crude estimation ( @xmath173 , @xmath136 and @xmath163v / cm ) ,",
    "we get @xmath174cm / v as piezoelectric constant .    the electromechanical effect invoked in the title of the article takes its origin here :",
    "the alignment of the created dipoles under the electric field , which is imposed by the quasi - one unidimensional electronic structure , associated with a large enough density of induced dipoles , allows the system to have a gigantic dielectric constant .",
    "although the amplitude of the dipoles is rather moderate , it is sufficient to create a huge local field . in turn",
    ", this local field acts as a pressure force on the chains which is sufficient to change the bond lengths and to induce a cdw deformation .    as discussed above , at the scale of a bond length , it is the local field @xmath175 which is felt by the polarizable bonds . under the electric field",
    "@xmath154 , the resulting hamiltonian for a unique chain then becomes ,    @xmath176    in our system of units , the total energy of a single chain under an applied voltage becomes ,    @xmath177    .",
    "the e - p coupling is fixed to @xmath178 .",
    "the initial discontinuities in the ground - state ( @xmath179 ) progressively disappear as the field increases . at about @xmath180 ,",
    "the cdw is depinned from the lattice and free to move .",
    "the band filling is @xmath42 . ]    with @xmath181 , and    @xmath182    @xmath183 is a constant term at fixed electric field @xmath154 which does not play any role in the cdw deformation .",
    "the parameter @xmath184 may vary significantly , depending on the dielectric constant , the electric field and @xmath130 .",
    ", the phonon gap decreases but persists .",
    "the cdw is still pinned by the lattice . above @xmath185 ,",
    "the pinning potential collapses leading to the closure of the phonon gap .",
    "the e - p coupling is @xmath178 and the band filling @xmath42 . ]",
    "the minimization of ( [ energie_e ] ) leads to the new bond lengths under the field @xmath154 . owing to the contraction induced by the electric field ( through @xmath186 ) , the electronic hopping terms in ( [ ssh_1 ] ) increase , allowing the electrons to pass more easily from one site to another",
    "this leads to the progressive closure of the discontinuities in the modulation function .",
    "the fig.[fig.4 ] shows its evolution as a function of the electric field @xmath154 ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the depinning transition ( when all the discontinuities of the modulation function vanish ) occurs at about @xmath187 . by taking the following reasonable parameters : @xmath188 , @xmath189ev , @xmath190ev/@xmath191 and @xmath192cm / v , the critical value @xmath193 leads to an electric threshold field of @xmath194v / cm , which is a correct order of magnitude with respect to the experiments .    eventually , the consequence of the present depinning mechanism is the important changes in the phonon spectrum .",
    "the fig.[fig.5 ] shows the phonon spectrum for two different non zero electric fields , below and above the threshold @xmath185 .",
    "notice that the zero field reference spectrum is the one represented on the fig.[fig.2 ] .",
    "the spectra are largely modified around @xmath45 by the application of the electric field .",
    "there is a global softening of the frequencies around @xmath45 .",
    "that phenomenon lowers the elastic constants of the chain , and thus the young modulus .",
    "we note that such a progressive lowering of the young modulus has also been observed @xcite . above the threshold @xmath185 ,",
    "the kohn anomaly is complete , the pinning potential collapses , the phonon gap vanishes and the frhlich mode is restored .",
    "this is in contrast with the weak e - p coupling depinning scenario for which no important changes in the phonon spectrum are expected under electric field since the pinning potential due to the impurities remains the same whatever the applied electric field is .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed the first depinning mechanism of cdws in the strong e - p regime .",
    "it is based on the effect of the local field which is very large owing the huge dielectric constant of the compounds .",
    "although it leads to a coherent cdw depinning scenario , many important points remain to be discussed with respect to the experiments .",
    "we mention here three of them .",
    "first , it is experimentally observed that for quasi - one dimensional systems , two electrical threshold fields ( called @xmath195 and @xmath196 ) must be considered at low enough temperatures . in spite of numerous studies performed since more than three decades , their origin remains mysterious @xcite .",
    "@xmath195 is the true onset of non - linear conductivity , and it is has been demonstrated that the induced current corresponds to a conduction by temporally ordered collective creeps which are thermally activated @xcite .",
    "the second threshold @xmath196 corresponds to an abrupt depinning of the cdw leading to an increase of the non - linear current by several orders of magnitude . in our scenario ,",
    "the threshold field which has been discussed corresponds to @xmath196 at which the pinning potential collapses . in our view , @xmath195 is related with the thermal excitations of the local ( equidistant ) discommensurations which naturally exist in the ground - state of the strong e - p coupling regime@xcite .",
    "second , the ssh model that we have used to illustrate our scenario contains all necessary ingredients to describe qualitatively the physics involved .",
    "however it is quantitatively unsatisfactory as it leads to modulation amplitudes which are too large with respect to those observed in real systems @xcite .",
    "another model which satisfies the criterion of strong coupling , i.e. with discontinuous modulation function , but with small enough modulation amplitudes , remains necessary to find .",
    "third , it is known that impurities injected in cdw compounds , at least for the quasi - one dimensional systems , increase the observed electrical threshold fields ( see for example @xcite ) . in this respect ,",
    "the most robust result is the invariance with the doping of the product @xmath197 .",
    "we note that this invariance is explicitly satisfied in our scenario since the true threshold field is the local one ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "however , we do not have at this stage a definitive answer on the exact role of impurities , although they likely soften the dielectric constant .    all these points will be examined in further publications .",
    "eventually , we emphasize that our scenario can be verified by inelastic x - rays or neutrons experiments by measuring the possible changes in the phonon spectrum under electric field .",
