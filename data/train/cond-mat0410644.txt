    "the promotion into the conduction band of an electron in a solid results in the creation of a hole in the valence band , which can be viewed as carrying a positive charge .",
    "the electron and hole therefore feel a coulomb attraction .",
    "a quasiparticle may result , known as an exciton , with an energy lower than the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "the conduction electron acts to partially screen the interaction between the surrounding nuclei and this results in a modification to the lattice potential .",
    "the neighbouring sites are drawn in and this produces a self - trapping of the exciton .",
    "the importance of this property of the exciton was first realised by davydov and kislukha in 1973 [ 2 ] . working in one dimension , they proposed that the exciton state could explain the dispersionless transport of energy in protein chains within the human body - a problem that had been important enough to earn the title : ` crisis in bioenergetics ' [ 3 ] .",
    "the quasiparticle moves along the chain , accompanied by its associated lattice deformation .",
    "due to its solitary wave - like properties , the bound state was termed a soliton .",
    "the existence of this state was found to exhibit a crucial dependence upon the electron - phonon coupling strength .",
    "the system used in modelling the one - dimensional chain was more recently adapted to describe the two - dimensional case . in the simplest example , i.e. the square lattice , an analysis of the stationary case showed that in the continuum limit the equations governing the evolution of the system could be reduced to a single nonlinear schroedinger equation with an extra term resulting from the discreteness of the lattice [ 4 - 6 ] .",
    "this equation , without the extra term , is well known to possess localized solutions in one dimension [ 7 ] . in two dimensions however , the soliton is stable only in the presence of the extra term .",
    "the equations were then adapted to the case of a hexagonal lattice [ 1 ] .",
    "again soliton solutions were found to exist .",
    "furthermore , the discrete equations were found , in the stationary limit , to obey a discrete nonlinear schroedinger equation .",
    "a similar equation was the starting point for investigations on the hexagonal and triangular lattices [ 8 ] .",
    "the fact that no such discrete solution could be found in the case of a square lattice suggests that solitons could have an important role in the dynamics of hexagonal crystal lattices , and therefore carbon nanotubes .",
    "nanotubes can be thought of geometrically as rolling up a two dimensional hexagonal graphite sheet .",
    "the angle at which the sheet is rolled , known as the chiral angle [ 9 ] , determines whether the carbon nanotube is semi - conducting or metallic . because of the band properties of semiconductors , it is these types of tubes in which excitons are most important . due to the nanoscale structure of carbon nanotubes",
    ", even a single exciton state could have a considerable effect on the structure s electrical properties .",
    "the system hamiltonian includes terms that describe the movement of an exciton to a neighbouring lattice site , known as the resonance interaction .",
    "studies so far have worked in the zeroth approximation excluding terms coupling the resonance interaction to the lattice .",
    "here we present the results of our investigations taking into account first order couplings of the resonance interaction to the lattice phonons : terms expected to be important in describing carbon naotubes .",

    "the singly - wrapped state ( figure 6a ) was studied in this way : in particular the boundary between the minimum energy phases of the singly - wrapped state and the completely delocalised state starting at @xmath77 .",
    "starting at these values of the couplings , @xmath12 was gradually increased .",
    "the singly - wrapped state was found to decay into the completely delocalised state with extremely little or indeed no perturbation . in each case",
    "the transition was extremely gradual , with the maximum in the probability density slowly decreasing with time .",
    "this was in stark contrast to the transitions observed from the polaronic and two - site localised states , which were found to decay extremely quickly .",
    "the procedure was repeated along the boundary , giving similar results .",
    "the state was found to show a large degree of stability only within those regions where it was the minimum energy state .",
    "however this is a considerable part of the @xmath78 phase diagram .",
    "the stability of the state localised around six sites was also studied in detail for decreasing @xmath12 . in this case",
    "perturbations were applied once again by increasing the magnitude of the exciton field around the soliton in an attempt to encourage it to spread out .",
    "figure 11 displays the results .     and @xmath12__,width=453,height=377 ]    the region to the left of the circles corresponds to the region in figure 4 where the minimum energy state is the six - site - localised state . to the right of the circles the minimum energy configuration is the singly - wrapped state .",
    "perturbations were again applied by increasing the exciton field at the nearest neighbour sites .",
    "the narrow band between the lines of circles and crosses in figure 11 is the region where the six - site solitons showed a degree of stability .",
    "in fact the states were stable up to values of @xmath72 for all values of the couplings @xmath12 and @xmath16 in this region . in the region to the right of the crosses the solitons localised around six sites were found to be unstable , decaying into the singly - wrapped state in the absence of any applied perturbation .",
    "terms describing the coupling of the exciton resonance interaction to lattice displacements were included into a hamiltonian describing the existence of excitonic states on a hexagonal lattice with continuous boundary conditions .",
    "the added terms were found to spoil the elegant analytic solution to the equations of motion found in [ 1 ] , however numerical simulation showed that these terms produced a rich structure in the coupling phase space of stationary states . by damping the displacement and exciton fields , solitonic stationary states localised around varying numbers of lattice sites",
    "were observed including , in agreement with previous results , extremely localised polaron states .",
    "certain solitons were also found to wrap around the lattice , producing patterns of lattice displacement that may perhaps be used to study the effects of solitons upon the electrical properties of carbon nanotubes .",
    "the stability of states for certain values of @xmath16 and @xmath12 was investigated numerically by introducing perturbations . in most cases the system possessed metastable states in addition to the ground state . some of these metastable states appeared to be separated from the ground state by a small energy barrier and were thus local minima of the energy .",
    "other excited states were found to exhibit stability under perturbation .",
