    "since the singularity confinement criterion was introduced as a discrete analogue of the painlev test @xcite , many discrete analogues of painlev equations have been proposed and extensively studied @xcite .",
    "discrete painlev equations have been considered as 2-dimensional non - autonomous birational dynamical systems which satisfy this criterion and which have limiting procedures to the ( continuous ) painlev equations . in recent years",
    "it was shown by sakai that all of these ( from the point of view of symmetries ) are obtained by studying rational surfaces in connection with extended affine weyl groups @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , recently kajiwara _ et al _ ( kny ) @xcite have proposed a birational representation of the extended weyl groups @xmath9 on the field of rational functions @xmath10 , which is expected to provide higher order discrete painlev equations ( however , this representation is not always faithful , for example it is not faithful in the case where @xmath11 or @xmath12 equals @xmath13 and in the case of @xmath14 ) . in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath15 ,",
    "the actions of the translations can be considered to be 2-dimensional non - autonomous discrete dynamical systems and therefore to correspond to discrete painlev equations .",
    "special solutions and some properties of these equations have been studied by several authors @xcite . in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the action of the translation was thought to be a symmetric form of the @xmath6-discrete analogue of painlev v equation ( @xmath6-@xmath16 ) .",
    "however , the symmetry @xmath17 does not coincides with any symmetry of discrete painlev equations in sakai s list , ( in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath18 , it coincides with an equation , which is associated with a family of @xmath3 surfaces and whose symmetry is @xmath19 , in sakai s list ) .",
    "so it is natural to suspect that the symmetry might be a subgroup of a larger group associated with some family of rational surfaces .    in this paper",
    "we show that in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath2 the action of the translation can be lifted to an automorphism of a family of rational surfaces of the type @xmath3 , i.e. surfaces such that the type of the configuration of irreducible components of their anti - canonical divisors is @xmath3 , and therefore that the group of these automorphisms is @xmath4 ( hence it is not @xmath6-@xmath16 by sakai s classification ) .",
    "the action can be decomposed into two mappings which are conjugate to the @xmath6-@xmath7 equation .",
