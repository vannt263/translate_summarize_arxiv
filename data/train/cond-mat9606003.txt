    "a 2d fully frustrated ( ff ) ising model is a model with ising spins @xmath0 where the interactions between nearest neighbor spins have modulus @xmath1 and sign @xmath0 ( ferro / antiferromagnetic interactions ) and where the signs are chosen in such a way that every _ plaquette _",
    "( i.e. the elementary cell of square lattice ) is _ frustrated _ , i.e. every plaquette has an odd number of -1 interactions so that the four spins of the plaquette can not simultaneously satisfy all four interactions . in fig.1.1",
    "we give an example of such a deterministic interaction configuration . in a plaquette of the ff model",
    "we can have only one or three satisfied interactions .",
    "the ff model has an analytical solution @xcite and a critical temperature at @xmath2 .    since single - spin dynamics for ff suffers critical slowing down , a fast cluster dynamics was introduced by kandel , ben - av and domany ( kbd ) in ref.@xcite .",
    "the kbd - clusters are defined by choosing stochastically on each plaquette of a checkerboard partition of a square lattice one bond configuration between the three shown in fig.1.2 .",
    "the probability of choice depends on spins configuration on the plaquette and it is a function of temperature ( _ correlated site - bond percolation _",
    "when there is only one satisfied interaction the zero - bond configuration is chosen with probability one .",
    "when three interactions are satisfied the zero - bond configuration is chosen with probability @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath5 the absolute temperature ) , the bond configuration with two parallel bonds on two satisfied interactions is chosen with probability @xmath6 and the third bond configuration has zero probability .",
    "two sites are in the same cluster if they are connected by bonds . for sake of simplicity from now on we choice @xmath7 .",
    "ref.@xcite has stimulated several works @xcite that pay attention mainly to dynamics and to number of clusters and clusters sizes . in @xcite numerical simulations on relatively large ff lattice sizes ( number of sites @xmath8 )",
    "supported the idea that the kbd - clusters represent spin correlated regions ( like coniglio - klein clusters @xcite do in ising model ) and consequently percolation temperature @xmath9 coincides with critical temperature @xmath10 , percolation exponents coincide with critical ones and kbd - clusters at @xmath9 are 2d self - avoiding walks ( saw ) at @xmath11 point .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we extensively study percolative features of kbd - clusters , considering very large lattice sizes ( @xmath12 ) , and give numerical results on critical exponents , cluster distribution and fractal dimension at percolation point .",
    "we consider finite systems with increasing size ( @xmath13 ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a cluster percolates when it connects two opposed system sides . for every size @xmath14",
    "there is a percolation temperature @xmath15 . with @xmath9 ( without any argument ) we mean the percolation temperature in the thermodynamic limit i.e. @xmath16 for @xmath17 . in this limit",
    "percolating clusters are present at @xmath18 but not at @xmath19 . in fig.2",
    "we show typical clusters at several temperatures for a finite system with size @xmath20 .    for every @xmath14 we have studied the mean cluster size @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the cluster size , @xmath23 the number of cluster of size @xmath22 per lattice site and the sum",
    "is extended over all finite clusters ) , the percolation probability @xmath24 , the number of cluster @xmath25 , the number of bonds per lattice site @xmath26 , the mean size of the largest ( percolating ) cluster @xmath27 and the mean size of the second largest ( percolating ) cluster @xmath28 .",
    "these quantities are shown in fig.3 for @xmath13 .",
    "let s note that for @xmath29 the bonds cover 50% of lattice interactions",
    "( that is the random - bond percolation threshold on square lattice ) , @xmath28 goes to a finite value ( like predicted by kbd @xcite and already verified in ref.@xcite ) and occupies almost 35% of the lattice , and that @xmath27 occupies almost 65% of the lattice . at @xmath30",
    "only two clusters survive , as shown in fig.2 e ) and f ) .    now we will give numerical estimates of critical exponents that characterize the kbd - cluster percolation .",
    "we know @xcite that in the thermodynamic limit the mean cluster size diverges for @xmath31 , the percolation probability goes to zero in the limit @xmath32 and the number of cluster goes to zero for @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that near @xmath9 the _ connectivity length _",
    "@xmath34 ( i.e. the typical linear cluster size ) diverges like @xmath35 , the percolation probability goes to zero like @xmath36 and the number of cluster goes to zero like @xmath37 .",
    "the last relations are definitions of critical exponents @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    by standard finite - size scaling considerations @xcite we can make the _ ansatz _ @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are _ universal functions _ , i.e. independent by @xmath14 .    via data - collapse",
    "( see fig.4 ) we estimate the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 with error of one unit in the last given digit .",
    "therefore the scaling relation @xmath53 and the hyperscaling relation @xmath54 are satisfied with good approximation .",
    "in tab.1 we give numerical estimates of @xmath15 .",
    "the data are obtained taking for @xmath55 the values of @xmath15 at which the @xmath56 data in a log - log plot vs. @xmath57 follow two parallel straight lines ( one above and one below @xmath15 ) with slopes in good agreement with @xmath58 and then best - fitting these values as @xmath59 .",
    "let s now consider the fractal dimension @xmath60 of the percolating cluster . from the scaling invariance hypothesis @xcite we know that @xmath61 , then we obtain @xmath62 ( hyperscaling ) . in present case",
    "we have @xmath63 , then @xmath64 .",
    "the same result is obtained from the scaling relation @xmath65 .",
    "this is confirmed by the analysis of cluster distribution ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "the scaling invariance hypothesis @xcite gives for @xmath31 and @xmath66 @xmath67 with @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 universal function .    from data - collapse for @xmath23 near @xmath9",
    "( see fig.6.a ) we obtain numerical estimates of parameters .",
    "the data in fig.6.a are chosen in such a way that the quantity @xmath71 ( with @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) is a constant with @xmath74 for every considered @xmath14 .",
    "the results are @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( with error of one unit in the last digit ) , that , with the definitions of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , give @xmath79 and @xmath73 . on the other hand these values of @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "satisfies the relation @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82.@xcite    from fig.6.a we see that the universal function @xmath70 is a bell - shaped curve for @xmath74 . for temperatures slightly below @xmath15 ( fig.6.b ) @xmath70",
    "is shifted , while for temperatures slightly above @xmath15 ( fig.6.c ) @xmath70 changes dramatically its shape .",
    "away from @xmath15 we know @xcite that is valid the relation @xmath83 for @xmath84 , with @xmath85 above @xmath15 and @xmath86 below @xmath15 .",
    "this relation is confirmed with reasonable approximation by our numerical simulations , as shown in fig.7 .",
    "let s note that , while the exponent @xmath85 above @xmath15 is good for a wide range of @xmath22 ( @xmath87 for @xmath88 ) , the exponent @xmath89 below @xmath15 is good for a smaller @xmath22 range ( @xmath90 for @xmath88 ) since finite - size effect become more important below @xmath15 .",
    "the smaller @xmath5 , the smaller @xmath22 range is .    a direct way to estimate the fractal dimension @xmath60 is given through its definition @xmath91 for @xmath92 , with @xmath93 radius of gyration of the cluster of size @xmath22 . we know",
    "@xcite that cluster dimension deviates from @xmath60 away from @xmath9 , becoming the euclidean dimension @xmath94 below @xmath9 and a value smaller than @xmath60 above @xmath9 .",
    "this is true because eq.([def_d ] ) is valid within the connectivity length @xmath34 for all temperatures , but @xmath34 goes to zero away from @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately data about this relation are difficult to analyze .",
    "indeed near @xmath15 for every finite system with @xmath95 it seems that @xmath60 is almost @xmath96 ( the fractal dimension of a saw at @xmath11 point ) , but for larger @xmath14 ( see fig.8 and tab.1 ) the fractal dimension @xmath60 grows slowly to the asymptotic value 2 .",
    "we have numerically investigated the kbd - cluster percolation problem in 2d ff ising model . from our simulation we found that , within numerical errors , this correlated site - bond percolation satisfies scaling and hyperscaling relations and have , in the thermodynamical limit , a percolation temperature @xmath97 and the exponents @xmath98 , @xmath63 , @xmath58 , @xmath73 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "moreover at @xmath9 clusters are compact ( fractal dimension @xmath79 ) .",
    "therefore now we can correct the conclusion of ref.@xcite and say that , since @xmath103 and @xmath41 is equal to spin correlation exponent @xcite , the site connectivity length @xmath34 goes like the spin correlation length diverging at zero temperature .",
    "although the exponent @xmath40 is different the coincidence between @xmath34 and correlation length is enough to give an efficient monte carlo cluster dynamics.@xcite",
