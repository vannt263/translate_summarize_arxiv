    "the approach of ref.@xcite amounts in expressing the volume of a classical polyhedron in terms of its face areas , which are in turn promoted to be operators .",

    "such difficulties do not occur in the simplest case of a polyhedron , i.e. a tetrahedron consisting of four faces represented by angular momentum operators coupling to a total spin singlet @xcite .",
    "indeed , for such a quantum tetrahedron all three definitions of the volume operator coincide . on the other hand , for a classical tetrahedron the general phase space parametrization devised by kapovich and millson @xcite results in just one pair of canonical variables , and the ( square of the ) volume operator can explicitly formulated in terms of these quantities @xcite .",
    "moreover , bianchi and haggard have performed a bohr - sommerfeld quantization of the classical tetrahedron where the role of an hamiltonian generating classical orbits is played by the volume operator squared .",
    "the resulting semiclassical eigenvalues agree extremely well with exact numerical data @xcite .",
    "the above observations make clear that classical tetrahedra , arguably the simplest structures a volume can be ascribed to , should be considered as perfectly integrable systems . in turn",

    "the volume operator squared and its eigenfunctions ( as opposed to the eigenvalues ) , an effective operator in terms of a quantum harmonic oscillator was derived providing an accurate as well as transparent description of the the large - volume sector .",

    "the results are compared with the outcome of a canonical quantization of the classical volume expression .",
    "the expression of the pentahedral volume in terms of kapovich - millson variables is discussed in appendix [ penta ] .",
