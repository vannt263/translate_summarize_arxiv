    "the qcd description of the diffractive deep inelastic scattering processes @xmath1 ( ddis ) is based on the series expansion of the scattering amplitudes in the inverse powers of a large scale @xmath0 , defined as a negative squared four - momentum transfer from the electron to the proton carried by the virtual photon @xmath2 . in the leading twist-2 approximation the diffractive proton structure functions @xmath3 can be calculated using diffractive parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) due to the collins factorization theorem @xcite , whereas the dpdfs dependence on the hard scale is governed by the celebrated dglap evolution equation . despite of great efficiency of this approximation in the data description",
    "this approach has an obvious limitation that follows from negligence of the higher twists contributions .",
    "certainly , the higher twists contribute at any energy scale and become relevant for data description below some virtuality @xmath0 , which depends on the process and required precision . in this presentation",
    "we point out that in the case of ddis the dglap description breaks down at the scale @xmath4 gev@xmath5 and to show that these deviations are consistent with a higher twists contribution .",
    "1 . left panel - kinematics of the ddis scattering .",
    "right panel - the @xmath6 for nlo dglap and nlo dglap + ht fits to zeus lrg data @xcite with @xmath7 .",
    "the ddis is an quasi - elastic electron - proton scattering process @xmath8 in which the final hadronic state @xmath9 with four - momentum @xmath10 is separated in rapidity from the proton , that scatters elastically ( see fig .",
    "the @xmath11-integrated @xmath12 cross - section reads : = [ 1+(1-y)^2]_r^d(3 ) ( , q^2 , ) where the invariants read @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 is the invariant mass squared in photon - proton scattering , and @xmath18 is the invariant mass of the hadronic state @xmath9 . the reduced - cross - section may be expressed in terms of the diffractive structure functions _",
    "r^d(3 ) ( , q^2,)=f_t^d(3)+ f_l^d(3 ) , whereas the structure functions @xmath19 may be , respectively , expressed through transversally and longitudinally polarized @xmath2 - proton cross sections @xmath20 .    in the recent analysis @xcite the zeus diffractive data",
    "were fitted within nlo dglap approximation .",
    "a satisfactory description was found only for @xmath21 gev@xmath5 .",
    "the zeus fits were performed above @xmath22 and then extrapolated to lower photon virtualities .",
    "the deviations of the fits rapidly grow with decreasing @xmath23 and @xmath0 reaching 100 percent effect at the minimal @xmath24 gev@xmath5 and @xmath25 .",
    "we confirmed this result throug the calculation of @xmath26d.o.f .",
    "for subsets of zeus lrg data with @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) .",
    "the cut - off in @xmath29 is imposed to reject part of the data with significant contributions from higher fock states not included in our model .",
    "it is clear from this discussion that the leading twist dglap evolution is unable to describe the ddis data below @xmath4 gev@xmath5 and at the low @xmath23 .",
    "2 . left panel - the quark box contribution .",
    "right panel - the @xmath30 contribution .",
    "the large energy limit of the ddis scattering may be described within the framework of the colour dipole model @xcite . in this approach",
    "the @xmath31 process is factorized into an amplitude of photon fluctuation into the partonic debris and then scattering of these states off the proton by the multiple gluon exchange .",
    "we take into account the contributions from the fluctuation of the photon into a colour singlet quark - antiquark pair @xmath32 and into @xmath32-gluon triple ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . this gives the @xmath11-integrated @xmath31 cross section @xmath33 .",
    "assuming an exponential @xmath11-dependence of diffractive cross - section , one finds for the @xmath32 component ( see fig.2 , left panel ) [ diff_cross_sec_qq ] = _ 0 ^ 1 dz ( -m_x^2 ) _",
    "f_spin| d^2r e^i^f_h|h,(q , z,)_d ( r,)|^2 . where @xmath34 is a diffractive slope , @xmath35 and the first sum runs over the three light flavours .",
    "the second sum of ( [ diff_cross_sec_qq ] ) means summation over massless ( anti)quark helicities @xmath36 in the case of longitudinal photons whereas for transverse photons there is an additional average over initial photon polarizations @xmath37 .",
    "the squared photon wave functions can be found in literature@xcite .",
    "we use the gbw parametrization @xcite for the dipole - proton cross section @xmath38 where the saturation radius in ddis @xmath39 gev@xmath40 and @xmath41 mb , @xmath42 , @xmath43 . the contribution of the @xmath30 component of @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "2 , the right panel ) is calculated at @xmath44 and in the soft gluon approximation ( the longitudinal momentum carried by the gluon is much lower then carried by the @xmath32 pair ) .",
    "this approximation is valid in the crucial region of @xmath45 or @xmath46 , where the deviations from dglap are observed .",
    "the correct @xmath29-dependence is then restored using a method described by marquet @xcite , with kinematically accurate calculations of wsthoff @xcite . with these approximations",
    "one obtains : [ cross_sec_qqg ] & = & d^2r_01 n^2_q|qg ( r_01,)_f_spin_0 ^ 1 dz|^f_h|h,(q , z , r_01)|^2 , + n^2_q|qg ( r_01 ) & = & d^2r_02 ( n_02+n_12-n_02n_12-n_01 ) ^2 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 denote the relative positions of quark and antiquark @xmath49 , quark and gluon @xmath50 in the transverse plain .",
    "the form of @xmath51 follows from the good - walker picture of the diffractive dissociation of the photon @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath52 is a remnant of the phase space integration under the soft gluon assumption .",
    "the twist decomposition of ( [ diff_cross_sec_qq ] ) is performed through the taylor expansion in the inverse powers of @xmath53 whereas that of ( [ cross_sec_qqg ] ) using mellin transform technic @xcite .",
    "3 . the lrg zeus data for @xmath54 at low @xmath0 compared to a dglap fit @xcite and the dglap fit with included twist-4 and twist-4 and  6 corrections from the mss saturation model . in yellow ( gray )  the region of @xmath29 where the correction due to @xmath55 may be neglected .    in fig .",
    "3 we compare selected results with data . the saturation model ( mss model )",
    "results are obtained using the original gbw parameters @xmath37 and @xmath56 , and three massless quark flavours . in our approach",
    "we modified the gbw parameter @xmath57 to @xmath58 in order to account for the difference between bjorken @xmath59 and pomeron @xmath23 , the variables used in gbw dipole cross - section in dis and ddis respectively .",
    "we chose @xmath60 that provides a good description of the data .",
    "the conclusion from the analysis and from fig .",
    "3 is that a combination of the dglap fit and twist-4 and twist-6 components of the model gives a good description of the data at low @xmath0 .",
    "inclusion of these higher twist terms improves the fit quality in the low @xmath0 region ( see the dashed curve at fig .",
    "1 right panel ) .",
    "indeed , the maximal value of @xmath26d.o.f .",
    "@xmath61 at @xmath62 gev@xmath5 is significantly lower then @xmath26d.o.f .",
    "@xmath63 of the dglap fit . nevertheless , it is important to stress that a truncation of the twist series ( up to twist-6 ) is required to have a good description of the data .",
    "the truncation of this kind , however , may be motivated in qcd .",
    "let us recall that in bfkl , at the leading logarithmic approximation , only one reggeized gluon may couple to a fundamental colour line .",
    "since dglap and bfkl approximations have the same double logarithmic ( @xmath64 ) limit , one concludes that also in dglap couplings of more than two gluons to a colour dipole is much weaker than in the eikonal picture .",
    "thus one can couple only two gluons to a colour dipole and up to four gluons to @xmath30 component ( two colour dipoles in the large @xmath65 limit ) without bfkl constraint .",
    "this means that one may expect a suppression beyond twist-8 if only the @xmath32 and @xmath30 components are included in the calculations .    in conclusion ,",
    "the ddis data at low @xmath0 provide the first evidence for higher twists effects in dis in the perturbative domain and opens a possibility for further theoretical and experimental investigations .",
