    "<S> we report the phase diagram of the doping series u@xmath0pt@xmath1rh@xmath2c@xmath0 , studied through measurements of resistivity , specific heat and magnetic susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> the nel temperature of u@xmath0rhc@xmath0 of @xmath3 k is suppressed with increasing pt content , reaching zero temperature close to @xmath4 , where we observed signatures of increased quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , evidence is presented that the antiferromagnetic state undergoes a spin - reorientation transition upon application of an applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this transition shows non - monotonic behaviour as a function of @xmath5 , peaking at around @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity is observed for @xmath7 , with @xmath8 increasing with increasing @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction in @xmath8 and increase in residual resistivity with decreasing pt content is inconsistent with the extension of the abrikosov - gorkov theory to unconventional superconductivity . </S>"
