    "black hole ( bh ) relativistic jets are observed from black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) and active galactic nuclei(agns ) . a puzzling coupling between the jet and the accretion disk has been recognized .",
    "observationally , the radio luminosity ( which is likely due to the radiation from the relativistic jet or may also be from the semi - relativistic disk wind ) increases with increasing x - ray luminosity ( which is likely due to the radiation from the disk ) , until it shows a sudden drop when the x - ray luminosity exceeds a certain limit @xcite . in terms of the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath0",
    ", this limit has a value about @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the accretion rate , @xmath6 is the eddingtion accretion rate , @xmath7 is the eddingtion luminosity , @xmath8 is the efficiency converting the energy of the accreting mass into the radiation energy , and @xmath9 is the speed of light .",
    "in addition , when the x - ray luminosity changes , the x - ray spectral state also changes , indicating that the accretion disk changes its type with the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "since it is believed that bh relativistic jets are originated from the rotating bhs that are threaded by large - scale magnetic lines and are powered by the rotational energy of the bh @xcite , an investigation of whether the bh energy can be extracted by hole - threading magnetic field lines when the bh is surrounded by different type of accretion disks , may offers the key to an understanding of the disk - jet coupling of bhxbs and agns .",
    "how the disk type varies @xmath0 is described below .",
    "when the accretion rate is extremely low , the energy transfer due to coulomb collisions between ions and electrons is very inefficient . as a result",
    ", the ions can not efficiently transfer the heat to the electrons , and the disk becomes an advection - dominated accretion flow or adaf for short @xcite , which corresponds to a hot , radiatively inefficient , optically thin and geometrically thick disk .",
    "as the accretion rate increases , the outer part of the disk cools down due to efficient coulomb collisions , and becomes a cold , optically thick and geometrically thin disk @xcite , hereafter we use the term `` ssd '' ( shakura - sunyaev disk ) to refer to such disk ; consequently , a combined disk is formed with an inner adaf and an outer ssd . in a combined disk , the radius where the transition from thin disk to adaf occurs is called the transition radius , @xmath10 . in general",
    ", @xmath10 decreases with increasing @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "when the accretion rate further increases and exceeds a critical value with @xmath11 , the coulomb interaction becomes so efficient at every radius of the disk that the whole disk cools down , changing into the ssd .",
    "the plasma rotational motion is nearly keplerian in a ssd , whereas it becomes sub - keplerian in an adaf , because the pressure gradient force contributed in the radial force balance in the latter type of accretion disk .",
    "it is interesting to note that the accretion flow geometries _ near the horizon _ are _ quasi - spherical _ for all the above disks ( see section 2 for more details ) . as a result , there are considerable plasma flow along the hole - threading line , reducing the electromagnetic extraction of bh energy by contributing their rest - mass energy .",
    "this consideration mainly differentiates our model from previous explanations of the disk - jet couplings ( e.g. , meier 2005 ; ferreira et al .",
    "we emphasize that this effect is important at low accretion rate , e.g. , when @xmath2 , due to the quasi - spherical geometry near the event horizon ; at higher accretion rate , e.g. , when @xmath0 as large as @xmath12 @xcite , the accretion disk type further varies to a slim disk @xcite and a _ disk - type _ geometry near the horizon is realized .",
    "therefore , a pure electromagnetic extraction of bh energy at most of the latitudes becomes a good approximation .    to consider the contribution of the quasi - spherical accreting plasma near the bh",
    ", we adopt the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) theory and consider the `` mhd penrose process '' @xcite , which includes both the electromagnetic and plasma inertia effects , to examine the extraction of the bh rotational energy . by constraining the magnetic field strength and the plasma density from the theory of accretion disks in a strong gravitational field",
    ", we investigate the importance of plasma inertia for different accretion disk types at low accretion rates .",
    "it is found that the mhd extraction of bh energy takes place preferentially in a combined disk and therefore enables the launch of a relativistic jet ; however , such relativistic jets are quenched if a magnetic dominance breaks down when the entire accretion disk become a thin disk .",
    "we also propose a new paradigm of the coupling between the accretion disk and the jet for both bhxbs and agns .",
    "the observed launching and quenching of relativistic jets at low accretion rates and several other puzzling observational results , are naturally explained .",
    "we introduce our model in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we summarize necessary formulae and concepts of the general relativistic ideal mhd flow in a stationary and axisymmetric bh magnetosphere .",
    "next , the result is given in section 4 .",
    "finally , discussion and conclusion are respectively presented in section 5 and 6 .",
    "to qualitatively investigate whether a relativistic jet can be launched when the bh is surrounded by different type of accretion disks , we consider a model with following assumptions .",
    "comments on the assumptions are provided in section 5.3 .",
    "accretion disks are described by the analytical solutions adopted from the accretion disk theories . _",
    "the accretion disk type is important since both the large - scale field strength and the mass flux per magnetic flux tube ( hereafter , mass loading ) are related to the disk . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt the analytical solutions of the adaf and the ssd to represent the disk properties . for a combined disk ,",
    "these two types of disk solutions are connected at the transition radius .",
    "the analytical solution we adopted is provided in the appendix b. the @xmath13middle region solution of a ssd , in which the pressure and the opacity is respectively dominated by the gas pressure and the electron - scattering opacity , is used .",
    "_ 2 . parabolic large - scale hole - threading magnetic field lines are considered .",
    "_ we consider large - scale magnetic field lines that are dragged in from a distant region by the accretion flow .",
    "it is expected that the field lines can be finally accumulated near the bh with a parabolic geometry .",
    "thus , instead of solving for the field geometry , we adopt the paraboloidal field solution given in @xcite for the magnetic flux function @xmath14 , @xmath15\\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where the field strength @xmath16 is to be determined ( see appendix c for more details ) . here",
    ", we focus on magnetic field lines that thread the horizon , since they are responsible for the extraction of the rotational energy from a rotating bh .",
    "the accretion flow has a quasi - spherical geometry near the event horizon .",
    "_ an accretion flow will have a quasi - spherical geometry near the horizon if the flow become transonic before the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit , @xmath17 , @xcite .",
    "compare to a disk - like geometry , in which the accreting plasma enters the bh through a plunging region near the equatorial plane , the accreting plasma in a quasi - spherical geometry can fall onto the horizon at a wider range of latitudes . since the sonic point of the accretion flow is well outside of @xmath17 for a typical adaf , which has @xmath18 @xcite , and",
    "the sonic point is close to @xmath17 for an ssd , the plasma distribution _ near the horizon _ should have a quasi - spherical geometry for all the disk types we considered here , adaf , combined disk , and ssd .",
    "note that , for the ssd , the plasmas are conventionally supposed to plunge into the horizon in a disk - like geometry , which forms a striking contrast with our current picture .",
    "the magnetic field strength is parameterized by the gravitational binding energy . _ providing that the diffuse effect of the large - scale magnetic field is relatively unimportant , large - scale magnetic field lines can be ` arrested ' by the accretion disk , being dragged from the outer region toward the central bh @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize its strength @xmath19 at radius @xmath20 by ( see appendix a ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gravitational constant , @xmath23 is the mass of the central bh , @xmath24 is the surface density of the disk , and @xmath25 is the ratio of the gravitational binding energy of the disk at @xmath20 to the large - scale magnetic field energy inside radius @xmath20 .",
    "the determination of @xmath26 is not yet clear ; however , it can be related to the ionization degree of the accretion flow and the magnetic prandtl number .",
    "the accretion disk type is a function of the accretion rate . _",
    "as described in section 1 , from low to high @xmath0 , the disk type varies as follows : ( i ) adaf , ( ii ) combined disk that consists of an inner adaf and outer ssd , and ( iii ) ssd .",
    "hereafter , we call the corresponding range of @xmath0 as `` range i '' , `` range ii '' , and `` range iii '' , respectively .",
    "many studies on the transition radius @xmath10 between inner adaf and outer ssd give similar results @xcite . to qualitatively describe how the disk configuration changes with @xmath0",
    ", we adopt the analytical solution of @xmath10 from @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the viscosity of adaf in the @xmath28-prescription @xcite , @xmath29 is the critical accretion rate with a typical value @xmath30 , beyond which there is no adaf solution and hence the entire disk becomes the ssd type .",
    "we recognize that the entire disk becomes thin disk if @xmath31 is met @xcite , and define the critical accretion rate , @xmath32 , such that @xmath33 is obtained at @xmath32 . by further assuming that the accretion disk has a finite outer radius @xmath34 ,",
    "different ranges can be defined by ( see also figure 1 ) range i : @xmath35 ; range ii : @xmath36 ; and range iii : @xmath31 .    our strategy to investigate the formation of relativistic jet at different disk types is described below .",
    "in contrast to that there is only outflow along the large - scale , _ disk - threading _ field lines for disk winds @xcite , there are both inflow and outflow along the _ hole - threading _ field lines .",
    "the inflow ( or outflow ) is launched when the gravitational force acting on the plasma is larger ( or smaller ) than the magnetocentrifugal forces do .",
    "such a difference allows us to monitor the outflow properties by the inflow behavior ; for an mhd flow along a hole - threading line , a powerful _ outflow _ is realized only when the rotational energy is extracted by the _",
    "inflow_. therefore , the condition for jet formation is to extract the rotational energy of bh , which can be examined by solving the equation of motion , namely , that the relativistic bernoulli equation ( be ) , of the inflow along the field line ( see section 3 for more details ) .",
    "the influences of the disk type lie in how they affect the large - scale field strength ( @xmath37 ) and the mass loading . at the injection point of the inflow , @xmath38 , by denoting the superscript `` adaf '' and `` ssd '' as the analytical solutions of adaf and ssd , respectively , and assuming that the same value of @xmath26 can be applied to both adaf and ssd , these two physical properties can be estimated ( see table 1 ) in different region of the computation domain of @xmath0 accordingly .",
    "range i : _ adaf type_. the large - scale field at @xmath39 is estimated by the adaf surface density , that is , @xmath40 by equation ( 2 ) . the mass flux per field line at @xmath39",
    "is estimated by the adaf solution as well , which gives @xmath41 .",
    "range ii : _ combined disk type_. the large - scale magnetic field at @xmath39 , which contains an additional term due to the magnetic field advected from the thin disk to the adaf , is estimated by @xmath42 . the mass flux per magnetic flux tube at @xmath39",
    "is computed by @xmath43 , since the injection point is located inside the adaf .",

    "the result of our model is provided in section 4 .",
    "stationary and axisymmetric ideal mhd flows in a rotating bh magnetosphere have been investigated in several studies @xcite . in this paper , we adopt the kerr metric as the background geometry with signature ( -,+,+,+ ) and use the geometrized units such that @xmath55 , that is , the length scale is in the unit of ` @xmath56 ' .",
    "most of the derivations in this section follows the calculations in @xcite .",
    "note that a different signature ( + , -,-,- ) is used in their paper .      in the boyer - lindquist coordinate ,",
    "the metric is    @xmath57    where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the ideal mhd condition requires that the electric field vanish in the fluid s rest frame ,    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the electromagnetic field tensor satisfying the maxwell s equation , @xmath64 is the four velocity of the fluid , @xmath65 is the electromagnetic vector potential , and the comma refers to the derivative .",
    "the fluid equation of motion @xmath66 can be split into the two components : the ` relativistic be ' ( the poloidal equation ) that describes the flow along the field line , and the ` grad - shafronov equation ' ( the trans - field equation ) that describes the force balance perpendicular to the field lines , where the semi - colon refers to the covariant derivative .",
    "the be can be obtained by projecting the equation of the motion along the field line ; however , it can alternatively derived from the definition of proper time , @xmath67 the energy - momentum tensor @xmath68 consists of two terms .",
    "one is the electromagnetic term ,    @xmath69    and the other is the plasma term ,    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the pressure and @xmath72 is the energy density .",

    "the assumption of an adiabatic flow requires that the entropy along the field line be constant , which ensures that the term @xmath80 remains constant along the field line .",
    "there are four more conserved quantities along the field line : the angular velocity of the field line , @xmath81 , the particle flux per unit flux tube , @xmath82 , the total energy of the flow per particle , @xmath83 , and the total angular momentum of the flow per particle , @xmath84 .",
    "they can defined by ( cf .",
    "equations(2.3)-(2.6 ) of hirotani et al . 1992 )    @xmath85    @xmath86    @xmath87    @xmath88    where @xmath89 , @xmath90 denotes the fluid angular velocity , and @xmath91 the toroidal magnetic field seen by a distant static observer with four velocity @xmath92 .",
    "one should note that the sign of @xmath82 is defined by the signs of @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "although the magnetic field is defined by    @xmath95    however , it is convenient to introduce the rescaled poloidal field @xmath96 where @xmath97 runs over the poloidal coordinates , @xmath98 and @xmath99 . combining equations ( 12)-(14 ) , we have    @xmath100    where    @xmath101    and the poloidal alfven mach number is    @xmath102    the poloidal velocity of the plasma @xmath103 is defined by    @xmath104    substituting equation ( 17 ) into equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , we can express the energy of the fluid , @xmath105 , and the angular momentum of the fluid , @xmath106 , as    @xmath107    @xmath108    finally , combining equations ( 4 ) , ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) , and ( 22 ) , we obtain the be ( cf . equation ( 17 ) of takahashi et al .",

    "note that the order of the polynomial equation depends on the second term of equation ( 10 ) , because particle number conservation gives @xmath115 .",
    "the cold limit can be adopted when the second term in equation ( 10 ) is relatively unimportant to its first term , i.e. , @xmath116 ( in c.g.s unit ) .",
    "equation ( 10 ) therefore reduces to @xmath117 and the be becomes a fourth - order polynomial equation of @xmath103 . by introducing a parameter @xmath118 , we have    @xmath119    @xmath120\\;,\\ ] ]    @xmath121\\;,\\ ] ]    @xmath122 the cold be , therefore , can be expressed in terms of @xmath123@xmath124 where    @xmath125    @xmath126    @xmath127    @xmath128    even for a disk whose temperature is comparable with the virial temperature and the internal energy is comparable to the released gravitational energy ( e.g. , adaf ) , the cold limit can still be modestly satisfied .",
    "this is because the released gravitational binding energy is still a small fraction of the rest - mass energy .",
    "therefore , we solve the be in cold limit , equation ( 26 ) , for simplicity and expect the result is at least qualitatively correct . in order to specify the coefficients @xmath129 and @xmath130 , we need to specify the mass loading ( mass flux per magnetic flux tube ) , @xmath131 , and the strength and geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "it is provided in the appendix c how we compute these coefficients .",
    "there are two light surfaces , which are defined by @xmath132 , in a bh magnetosphere .",
    "the outer light surface is formed by the centrifugal force in the same manner as the light cylinder in a pulsar magnetosphere , and the inner light surface is , on the other hand , formed by the strong gravity of the bh and the rotation of the magnetic field .",
    "if a plasma starts with a negligible poloidal velocity , the inflow and outflow along the field line separate at the point @xmath133 where the gravitational force balances with the magnetocentrifugal forces .",
    "this point is called the `` separation point '' ( or the `` stagnation point '' ) and defined by @xmath134 , which leads to @xmath135 , where the prime denotes the derivative along the flow line .",
    "that is , if a plasma is injected at @xmath136 with @xmath137 ( or with @xmath138 ) , it will be accelerated inward ( or outward ) , subsequently passing through the alfven point @xmath139 and the inner ( or outer ) light surface .",
    "figure 3 shows the contours of @xmath140 around a bh with spin parameter @xmath141 .",
    "note that , at the injection point , the be reduces to    @xmath142      the critical points for an mhd flow can be found by differentiating equation ( 23 ) along the flow line , @xmath143 , where explicit expressions of @xmath144 and @xmath145 are given in @xcite and @xcite . for a general mhd inflow ,",
    "there are three critical points at which both @xmath145 and @xmath144 vanish : the ` slow - magnetosonic point ' , the ` alfven point ' , and the ` fast - magnetosonic point ' ; the poloidal velocity @xmath146 there matches the slow - magnetosonic velocity , the alfven velocity , and the fast - magnetosonic velocity , respectively . in the cold limit",
    ", the slow - magnetosonic velocity reduces to zero . due to the causality requirement at the event horizon",
    ", any mhd inflow must pass through the fast - magnetosonic point , after passing through the alfven point .    at the alfven point",
    "@xmath139 , the mach number equals @xmath140 ,    @xmath147    note that the requirement of @xmath148 implies that @xmath149 must be located between these two light surfaces .",
    "besides , it is convenient to express @xmath83 and @xmath84 in terms of the quantities evaluated at the alfven point .",
    "since both @xmath145 and @xmath144 automatically vanish at the alfven point , no additional constraints are imposed on the mhd flow at the alfven point .",
    "therefore , by requiring that the numerators in equations ( 21)-(23 ) vanish at @xmath139 , we obtain    @xmath150    @xmath151    and    @xmath152    combining equations ( 27 ) , ( 29 ) , and ( 30 ) , we can express the conserved quantities @xmath83 and @xmath84 in terms of @xmath153 and @xmath149 .",
    "after the mhd inflow pass through the alfven point , @xmath145 vanishes again in @xmath143 at the fast - magnetosonic point ; thus , @xmath144 should also vanish there .",
    "we should notice here that both @xmath154 and @xmath155 can be satisfied at the fast - magnetosonic point only for a specific combination of the conserved quantities , @xmath81 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath82 .",
    "in previous works , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , the authors gave @xmath81 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ( or equivalently , @xmath81 , @xmath153 , and @xmath149 ) and search @xmath82 to select the trajectory that pass through the fast - magnetosonic point .",
    "in this work , we instead give @xmath81 , @xmath153 , and @xmath82 , considering plasma injection from the innermost region of the accretion disk , and solve for @xmath149 ( or equivalently , @xmath83 ) .",
    "as explained next , whether the rotational energy of the bh is extracted outward can be determined by the location of @xmath149 .",
    "the sign of @xmath83 can be solely determined by @xmath149 via equation ( 29 ) because it follows form equation ( 27 ) that @xmath156 holds for any mhd flow starting from a position between the two light surfaces with a vanishing poloidal velocity .",
    "note that @xmath83 becomes negative if @xmath157 .",
    "thus , near the bh , a spatial region called the `` negative energy region '' , which satisfies @xmath158 , can be defined @xcite .",
    "if the alfven point resides in this region , the mhd inflow has @xmath159 ( which also implies @xmath160 because of @xmath156 ; whereas @xmath160 does not imply @xmath161 ) .",
    "a spinning bh differs from a static bh by an additional structure called `` ergosphere '' ( which is defined by @xmath162 ) , a region inside which any particle must orbit in the same direction of the hole spin .",
    "being locating outside the horizon , the ergosphere can be viewed as the region that stores the rotation energy of a bh .",
    "note that the negative energy region exists only when @xmath163 , and it is always located inside the ergosphere ( see also figure 3 ) .",
    "it is also noteworthy that a negative energy mhd inflow can be launched from a region outside the ergosphere .",

    "note also that the plasmas usually can not extract bh s energy ( i.e. , @xmath169 usually holds ) because of their rest - mass contribution , unless they are in a negative energy orbit , which is rare .    in a magnetically dominated magnetosphere ( @xmath183 ) , because @xmath175 is continuous across the separation point , a stationary outflow solution ( @xmath174 , @xmath161 and @xmath167 ) is possible only when it connects a negative - energy inflow ( @xmath159 and @xmath172 , such that @xmath167 ) .",

    "however , this kind of outflow , similar to the disk wind , will not be accelerated into relativistic energies and therefore is not of interest in the present paper . to summarize , for an mhd flow along the hole - threading field line",
    ", a stationary outflow with positive outward energy flux ( @xmath167 ) should connect an inflow solution with @xmath167 at the separation point , provided that the injected energy flux by accretion is small compared to the poynting flux .",
    "thus , we can investigate the activity of a poynting - flux - dominated jet ( or an outflow ) by examining the inflow energy , @xmath83 ( see also table 2 ) .",
    "it should be noted here that the term `` mhd penrose process '' refers to the case of @xmath167 ( remember @xmath83 is the ` total ' energy , consisting both the electromagnetic plus plasma energy of the flow ) , as initially proposed by @xcite ; however , it was used to indicate @xmath184 ( i.e. , a negative energy orbit of the particle ) in some previous studies @xcite .",
    "the latter case is possible , but can only be transient @xcite . in comparison , in the original idea of the ` penrose process ' @xcite , only the particle contribution ( @xmath185 ) was considered ; whereas in the blandford - znajek process @xcite , only the electromagnetic contribution ( @xmath186 ) was considered .",
    "we choose representative parameters to demonstrate the jet behavior at different disk type qualitatively .",
    "because the extraction of the rotational energy of bh is mainly related to whether the bh magnetosphere is magnetically dominated or not , the change of the parameters will result in only minor modification of the result in our model .",

    "in addition , to investigate the importance of the bh mass , we consider separately the bhxb and agn cases . for bhxb , we assume @xmath192 , whereas for agn , @xmath193 . furthermore , to explore the dependence of the ability of the disk in storing the large - scale magnetic field",

    "the inflow energy @xmath83 can be computed by imposing the fast - magnetosonic condition once the injection point , the angular velocity of the field and the mass loading are specified . however , to discuss the conditions for jet launching ( @xmath167 ) and quenching ( @xmath165 ) , it is adequate to examine the _ sign _ of @xmath83 , which is uniquely specified by the location of @xmath196 .",
    "specifically , if @xmath196 resides in the negative energy region , the mhd inflow has a negative energy ( @xmath159 ) and the mhd penrose process operates .",
    "therefore , by solving @xmath196 from the be for an mhd inflow onto a bh , we can investigate whether the energy extraction takes place as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "detailed computation steps are provided in the appendix .",
    "let us first consider the bhxb case with the bh mass , @xmath192 ( figures 4(a)-(d ) ) .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows how the large - scale field strength at the injection point varies with the accretion rate .",
    "it is important to note that in a combined disk ( region ii ) , the surface density of the disk does not monotonically increase inward but has a local maximum at the transition radius , @xmath197 . since an ssd can confine more large - scale field than an adaf because of its greater surface density for a fixed @xmath26 , the large - scale field arrested in the inner adaf for a combined disk ( solid line ) is relatively stronger than what the adaf alone would bring into the bh ( dashed line ) .",
    "the locations of @xmath196 for four discrete values of @xmath26 are shown in figures 4(b ) and 4(c ) ; the solid , dashed , dash - dotted , and dash - dot - dot lines correspond to @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath195 , respectively .",
    "it follows from the zoom - in figure ( figure 4(c ) ) that @xmath196 enters the negative energy region ( indicated by the shaded region ) in range ii for @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 , indicating that the mhd penrose process turns on in a combined disk .",
    "this is because , near the horizon , the relatively strong magnetic field ( which is mainly provided by the outer ssd ) and the relatively small mass loading ( which is provided by the inner adaf ) result in a magnetically dominated environment . in comparison , a magnetically dominated environment near",
    "the horizon is relatively harder to achieved when the disk is an adaf ( range i ) or an ssd ( range iii ) , because it is the same type of disk responsible for both the confinement of the large - scale field and the loading of the plasma .",
    "such disk - jet coupling provides the reason why observed relativistic jet is launched when @xmath0 is near ( but smaller ) the value @xmath1 , but quenched when @xmath0 exceeds @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , since @xmath37 increases with increasing @xmath0 , @xmath83 increases negatively ( i.e. , the rotational energy of bh is more efficiently extracted outwards ) with increasing @xmath0 once @xmath201 enters the negative energy region in range ii ( figure 4(d ) ) .",
    "this is because the bh magnetosphere becomes more magnetically dominated when the transition radius decreases with @xmath0 , resulting from that the difference between the surface density of the outer ssd and inner adaf becomes more significant .",
    "next , let us consider the agn case with @xmath193 ( figures 4(e)-(h ) ) .",
    "although the solutions look qualitatively similar , there are three major differences from the bhxb case .",
    "first , comparing figures 4(b ) , ( c ) , ( f ) and ( g ) , we find that for an agn , @xmath159 is realized in a wider range of @xmath0 for a fixed @xmath26 or in a wider range of @xmath26 for a fixed @xmath0 .",
    "second , comparing figures 4(d ) and ( h ) , we find that an agn can extract more bh rotational energy per plasma particle than a bhxb can . third , in an agn , the mhd penrose process works also in an ssd ( i.e. , range iii ) for a relatively greater @xmath26 ( e.g. , @xmath202 ) .",
    "however , the jet power decreases with increasing @xmath0 in an ssd ( i.e. , range iii ) , in contrast to the case of a combined disk ( i.e. , range ii ) . the above comparison can help to understand the observed properties of accreting bh in different masses ( see below ) .",
    "[ fig5 ]    the results in section 4 can offer the key to an understanding of the observed connections between the disks and the jets for bhxbs and agns . a universal paradigm of disk - jet couplings on the @xmath203 plane ( c.f .",
    "figures 4d & 4h ) is diagrammatically presented in figure 5 .",
    "transitions of disk - jet states are indicated by the arrows for three representative values of @xmath26 . since the terminal speed of an mhd outflow",
    "is roughly determined by the magnetic dominance at the launching point , the more magnetically dominated the disk innermost region becomes ( i.e. , the more a system moves downward on the @xmath203 plane ) , the greater speed an mhd outflow achieves .",
    "this discussion is valid for both the disk wind near the bh and the ergospheric jet .",
    "the two downward arrows in the right edge of this figure indicate how the terminal speed changes for a disk wind and a relativistic jet .",
    "note that the ergospheric jet can only be launched when @xmath159 ( i.e. , in the lower half of the diagram ) .",
    "the transitions of disk - jet states for bhxbs , which are indicated by the solid arrows , explain the observed features of the bhxb disk - jet couplings .",
    "@xcite show that two type of outflows associated with the x - ray spectral types are required to explain the systematic properties of the radio emission of bhxbs .",
    "the first type is a steady outflow observed when the bhxb is in a hard state ( hs ) , while the second type is a transient , ballistic , powerful and relativistic jet when the source is in a steep power - law ( spl ) state and being switching from the hs to the soft state ( ss ) .",
    "we interpret that the steady outflow ( first type ) is associated with the disk wind and the transient relativistic jet ( second type ) is associated with the ergospheric jet ejected for a modest or small @xmath26 .",
    "note that , as shown in the paradigm , when the entire disk become an ssd , not only that the ergospheric jet is turned off but also that the disk wind weakens , which explains the sudden drop of observed radio luminosity when the state transits to the ss .",
    "in addition , the energy of the jet per particle , @xmath204 , as well as the ergospheric jet power , @xmath205 , increase with increasing @xmath0 in a combined disk , where the surface integral @xmath206 is carried out on a closed surface ( e.g. , the horizon ) ; this likely corresponds to the observational fact that both the lorentz factor of a jet and its radio luminosity rapidly increase with increasing @xmath0 before the jet is quenched .",
    "when the bh is surrounded by a combined disk and the mhd penrose process takes place , the relatively strong field for the inner adaf can result in a configuration which has been studied in previous simulations @xcite , here we use the name _ _ magnetcially choked accretion flow ( mcaf ) _ _ , where @xmath198 .",
    "although slowed down by the magnetospheric barrier near @xmath207 , accreting plasma can still accrete inward in the form of highly non axisymmetry , irregular streams due to magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite .",
    "we stress that the magnetically dominated magnetosphere developed when the bh surrounded by a combined disk can result in an mcaf or other conceptually similar accretion flow . ]",
    "according to @xcite . accompanying by the jet formation",
    ", the formation of an mcaf can also explain some observation features when the source is in spl .",
    "for an mcaf , because the slowed down flow can earn more time to release their heat energy via radiation , the efficiency for the flow to convert mass to radiation energy increases @xcite . this can be the reason why the disk luminosity in spl state is higher than that in hs or ss @xcite .",
    "in addition , the high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) feature observed at spl state may be related to the jet - disk qpo mechanisms found by @xcite .    for agns ,",
    "the transitions are indicated by the dashed arrows , which imply the following disk - jet couplings .",
    "first , an efficient mhd penrose process ( i.e. , a greater @xmath204 ) is viable at a relatively smaller @xmath0 in an agn compared to a bhxb .",
    "since the ssd exists only in the outer region when @xmath0 is small , it is consistent with the observational fact that radio - loud agns favor a spectrum without a uv bump @xcite , which possibly arises in the inner edge of an ssd .",
    "second , the mhd penrose process works more efficiently with increasing bh mass .",
    "this conclusion explains why agn jets show higher lorentz factors than bhxb jets .",
    "moreover , it is also consistent with the observational fact @xcite that most radio - loud agn host bhs with larger masses ( @xmath208 ) , while radio - quiet agns host bhs with no obvious mass constraints .",
    "third , although a bhxb jet disappears when the disk transits from a combined disk to a ssd , an agn jet could still be launched from the ergosphere , because the ssd in an agn tends to be more magnetically dominated than in a bhxb owing to a smaller mass loading , @xmath209 , around a more massive bh .",
    "we interpret that these ergospheric jets ejected from the inner edge of the thin disks in agns result in ( at least part of ) the radio - loud quasi - stellar objects ; this forms a striking contrast to bhxbs from which no strong or steady radio emission has been detected in their ss .",
    "estimated from the dynamical timescale , the characteristic time scale for an accreting bh system to sustain the relativistic jet , @xmath210 , is scaled by the central bh mass with the relation @xmath211 . therefore , with @xmath210 equals to days for the relativistic jet from a bhxb with @xmath212 , relativistic jets from an agn with @xmath213 may last for @xmath214 years .",
    "note also that the relation between the accretion rate , @xmath0 , and the ergospheric jet power , @xmath215 , inverses in ranges ii and iii .",
    "that is , @xmath215 increases ( or decreases ) with increasing @xmath0 , when @xmath0 is relatively low ( or high ) and the disk is a combined disk ( or an ssd ) .",
    "provided that the x - ray luminosity indicates the disk accretion rate , these conclusions naturally explain the empirical relation for both bhxbs and agns : the radio luminosity increases with increasing x - ray luminosity when the bolometric luminosity , @xmath84 , is small , i.e. , when @xmath216 @xcite , while the radio luminosity decreases with increasing x - ray luminosity when some bh systems are luminous , i.e. , when @xmath217@xcite .      at large distances ,",
    "the spacetime is described by the minkowski metric ; thus , the lorentz factor of the jet , @xmath218 , is defined by @xmath219 . because @xmath83 is conserved quantitatively along the field lines and because the second term of equation ( 13 ) becomes negligibly small compared to the first term at large distances , we obtain @xmath220 where @xmath221 denotes the total energy of the mhd _",
    "outflow_.    we can further estimate the terminal jet speed , by linking @xmath221 with the total energy of the mhd _ inflow _ , @xmath222 , as : @xmath223 where the subscript `` in '' and `` out '' , respectively denotes the quantities for the inflow and the outflow .",
    "the above equation is obtained by considering the conservation of the outward energy flux near the separation point , provided that the magnetic field configuration does not change significantly there . in general , the ratio of the inflow and outflow particle flux , @xmath224 , is greater than unity because only a small portion of the plasmas will escape as an outflow . as a result ,",
    "equations ( 35 ) and ( 36 ) give @xmath225 hence , the inverse values of the total energy shown in figures 4(d ) and ( h ) , as shown in figure 6 , give an estimation of the lower limit of the ergospheric jet lorentz factor for bhxbs and agns . the bhxb and agn relativistic jet speeds inferred from the observations , which has the typical value @xmath226 for bhxbs ( e.g. , table 1 of fender et al .",
    "2004 ) and @xmath227 for agns , can be consistently explained by our model .",
    "to investigate the reason of the launching and quenching of bh relativistic jets when @xmath0 varies , we solve for stationary negative energy inflow solutions ( which corresponds to the formation of relativistic jets ) by adopting analytical solution of the adaf and the ssd , assuming a spherical accretion geometry near the horizon , and estimating the field strength of the large - scale hole - threading magnetic field by the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the major drawback of our approach is that we ignore the possible disk instability when the ssd becomes radiation pressure dominated . in addition ,",
    "our axial - symmetry and stationary solution miss the temporal and the non - axisymmetry properties of the jet formation .",
    "also , the disk dynamo effect and the magnetic reconnection process can further modify the large - scale fields , although their effects can be in general included in the parameter @xmath26 .    for our purpose",
    ", we ignore several aspects which we think are minor factors in determining whether the jet is _ on _ or _ off _ for simplicity .",
    "several discussions on the assumptions and the robustness of the result are provided in the following .",
    "we ignore the blandford - znajek extraction in the force - free region near the pole of the horizon in a quasi - spherical accretion flow .",
    "however , such extraction is expected to be a relatively minor factor to determine the jet launching .",
    "the reason is that most of the hole - threading field lines have considerable plasma loading on them , and that the power for magnetic fields extracting the energy from a rotating bh is proportional to @xmath228 @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of a combined disk is that the significant surface density difference of the ssd and the adaf at the transition radius .",
    "although here we describe the combined disk solution by patching the analytical solutions of the ssd and the adaf at the transition radius , the above feature is expected to be true even if a more detailed disk solution is considered .",
    "there are uncertainties in determining the large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "for example , the parameter @xmath26 can vary with the radius @xmath98 , and the total flux of the large - scale disk - threading magnetic fields is not unclear .",
    "however , the field lines that threads the disk are expected to be redistributed when the accretion disk types vary .",
    "the disk - jet coupling features described by our model can be qualitatively preserved as long as the diffuse effect is relatively unimportant than the advection effect for the large - scale disk - threading field lines .",
    "especially , a magnetically dominated magnetosphere near the horizon is still most likely realized when the bh is surrounded by a combined disk , provided that the large - scale magnetic field advected inward from the outer ssd is large enough for the inner adaf .",
    "such requirement is not difficult to be satisfied as the transition radius gradually decreases to a small enough radius ( figures 4(a ) and ( e ) ) .",
    "the result presented in figure 4 shows that a negative energy flow may form when the bh is surrounded by a combined disk ( range ii )",
    ". the conclusion can actually still be valid when more detailed pictures are considered .",
    "below we discuss two possible concerns .",
    "first , we consider whether the result would change when numerical adaf solutions , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , instead of the self - similar solutions , equations ( b1)-(b3 ) , are used .",
    "it is true that the self - similar analytical solutions are not a good approximation near the hole .",
    "for example , the causality requires a numerical solution of @xmath229 be greater than equation ( b1 ) near the bh , while the surface density @xmath230 be less than the self - similar solution , equation ( b3 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the numerator in equation ( c2 ) will not change because of the mass conservation , @xmath231 , provided that the disk height @xmath232 remains unchanged .",
    "since the magnetic field is predominantly supported by the outer thin disk , @xmath233 is essentially given by @xmath234 .",
    "as a result , neither @xmath131 nor @xmath233 contains significant errors if we adopt the self - similar solution of adaf .",
    "thus , the discussion given in this paper is not vulnerable for details of the adaf solutions .",
    "second , we discuss whether the estimation of the mass loading is fair when @xmath235 . in this case ,",
    "an mcaf is formed .",
    "the highly non - axisymmetry , irregular mcaf will try to avoid the strong field ranges by the magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability and result in strong - field , low - density ` magnetic islands ' @xcite . as a result ,",
    "both @xmath236 and @xmath229 _ decrease _ in a magnetic island .",
    "thus , even when @xmath237 , the mass loading from the magnetic island located at @xmath39 is lower than the estimate with the self - similar solutions , equations ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) .",
    "this means that the mhd inflow launched from the magnetic island should be even more magnetically dominated and that the energy of the inflow is still negative .",
    "in this paper we focus on the fundamental question : why relativistic jets from accreting bhs can be selectively launched under a certain accretion condition ? here we solve this problem by incorporating the plasma inertia effect , which have been neglected in previous studies , in conjunction with the electromagnetic effect on the extraction of bh energy . at low accretion rate ( e.g. , @xmath2 )",
    ", the accretion flow has a quasi - spherical geometry near the bh event horizon . as a result ,",
    "whether the rotational energy of the bh can be effectively extracted outward is determined by the inward rest - mass energy of the accreting plasmas .",
    "when the outward electromagnetic energy flux dominates , a relativistic , ergospheric jet can be therefore launched ; on the contrary , when the inward rest - mass energy dominates , there is no powerful relativistic jet . by examining the mhd penrose process for bhs surrounded by different types of accretion disk at low accretion rates ,",
    "we conclude that the mhd inflow becomes magnetically dominated preferentially in a combined disk , which consists of an outer ssd and an inner adaf , to enable the launch of an ergospheric jet .",
    "such relativistic jets are quenched if a magnetic dominance breaks down when the entire disk becomes an ssd .",
    "we also provide a universal paradigm of the coupling between the bh accretion disks and their relativistic jets at low accretion rates .",
    "several observed disk - jet connections are naturally explained . future study on the relation between the accretion geometry near the event horizon and the extraction of the bh energy will be important to the understanding of the bh jet formation mechanisms .",

    "<S> relativistic jets are launched from black hole ( bh ) x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei when the disk accretion rate is below a certain limit ( i.e. , when the ratio of the accretion rate to the eddingtion accretion rate , @xmath0 , is below about @xmath1 ) but quenched when above . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new paradigm to explain this observed coupling between the jet and the accretion disk by investigating the extraction of the rotational energy of a bh when it is surrounded by different types of accretion disk . at low accretion rates ( e.g. , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath2 ) , the accretion near the event horizon is quasi - spherical . </S>",
    "<S> the accreting plasmas fall onto the event horizon in a wide range of latitudes , breaking down the force - free approximation near the horizon . to incorporate the plasma inertia effect , </S>",
    "<S> we consider the magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) extraction of the rotational energy from bhs by the accreting mhd fluid , as described by the mhd penrose process . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the energy extraction operates , and hence a relativistic jet is launched , preferentially when the accretion disk consists of an outer shakura - sunyaev disk ( ssd ) and an inner advection - dominated accretion flow . when the entire accretion disk type changes into an ssd , the jet is quenched because the plasmas brings more rest - mass energy than what is extracted from the hole electromagnetically to stop the extraction . </S>",
    "<S> several other observed bh disk - jet couplings , such as why the radio luminosity increases with increasing x - ray luminosity until the radio emission drops , are also explained . </S>"
