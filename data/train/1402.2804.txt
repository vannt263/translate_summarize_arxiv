    "some recent experiments on the interaction of high power lasers with plasmas have shown evidence of shock - like structures with very high electric fields existing over very short distances@xcite .",
    "amendt et al @xcite say that data from proton radiography in inertial confinement fusion capsules suggest the existence of fields of more than @xmath0 vm@xmath1 over distances of the order of 10 - 100 nm . for the non - cryogenic targets used in the experiment amendt et al ( 2009 ) demonstrated that the experiment behaves as a quasi - collisionless classical plasma , this justifies the use of a collisionless theory especially when considering the extremely small length scales over which the electric field exist . in a more recent paper amendt",
    "et al @xcite suggest that barodiffusion ( ie pressure - driven diffusion ) may be a possible explanation , but this does not seem to produce very short length scales .",
    "another relevant recent paper is that of haberberger et al @xcite who describe experiments in which collisionless shocks generate high energy proton beams with small energy spread .",
    "our objective here is to show that there is a simple analytic treatment of collisionless shock structure in unmagnetized plasmas which can reproduce the essential features of these experiments and which may be useful in predicting the properties of shocks in collisionless plasmas .",
    "the basic method goes back to early studies of collisionless shocks , in particular the work of sagdeev @xcite , in which it is shown that solitary wave structures can be described by an equation analogous to that of a particle moving in a potential ( now usually referred to as the sagdeev potential ) .",
    "the sagdeev potential is a function of the electrostatic potential @xmath2 and a solitary wave occurs when the sagdeev potential has a maximum at the origin then goes through zero again at some finite value of @xmath3 in terms of the particle motion analogy there is a homoclinic orbit in its phase space leaving the origin , going to the other zero of the sagdeev potential , then returning to the origin over an infinite time period .",
    "sagdeev suggested that a shock like structure could be produced by introducing some damping into the system , so that the orbit , instead of returning to the origin ended up at the bottom of the potential well .",
    "a comprehensive review of analytical work describing electrostatic shocks is treated by tidman and krall @xcite .",
    "here we show that a shock structure can be produced by having a finite ion temperature so that some ions are reflected by the potential maximum at the shock .",
    "this produces the asymmetry between the upstream and downstream sides which destroys the familiar symmetrical ion sound solitary wave .",
    "the idea of reflection from the shock front has been familiar for many years , especially in studies of perpendicular shocks in magnetized plasmas where the reflected ions are turned around by the magnetic field and produce a foot structure ( see for example the analysis of woods @xcite ) . in a collisionless unmagnetized plasma the reflected ions simply travel upstream unimpeded .",
    "early observations of electrostatic shocks were made by taylor et al @xcite showing the kind of structure we describe , a potential ramp followed by downstream oscillations , at low mach numbers .",
    "computer simulations by forslund and freidberg @xcite later showed shocks , with more complicated dissipative structures at higher mach number .",
    "more recent pic simulations by fiuza et al @xcite also report shocks at higher mach numbers than the ones used in this paper .",
    "some work on this latter problem has been carried out by smirnovskii @xcite using basic ideas similar to ours presented here .",
    "the problem has been generalized to the relativistic case by stockem et al @xcite our objective is to give a more transparent account of the theory and to relate it to the recent experimental results mentioned above .",
    "consider collisionless ions flowing into a region where the potential increases from zero to some positive value @xmath4 taking the incoming ions to have a maxwellian distribution with average velocity @xmath5 the density where the potential is @xmath2 , normalised to the initial density of the incoming flow is    @xmath6dv      + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi } }      { \\int \\limits_{0}^{\\sqrt{2(\\phi_{\\max}-\\phi ) } } }      \\exp\\left [   -\\frac{\\left (   \\sqrt{v^{2}+2\\phi}-v\\right ) ^{2}}{2}\\right]dv      \\label{ion density}\\ ] ]    with ion velocities normalised to the thermal velocity @xmath7 and the potential to @xmath8 with @xmath9 the ion charge state , and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath12 is the ion mass .",
    "we assume that @xmath5 is sufficiently large that the backward part of the maxwellian in the shock frame is negligible .",
    "the second term here takes account of particles reflected from the potential maximum .",
    "this , of course , can not be chosen as an independent parameter but has to be consistent with the plasma dynamics , which is why it is included as an argument in @xmath13 its evaluation will be discussed later .    for the electrons we assume thermal equilibrium in the potential , with the electrons flowing to produce charge equilibrium far upstream where the potential tends to zero , so that @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "poisson s equation then gives @xmath16 with distances scaled to @xmath17 in order to find @xmath18 self - consistently we introduce the sagdeev potential @xmath19 through@xmath20   d\\phi^{\\prime}\\label{sag pot}\\ ] ] so that ( [ poisson ] ) becomes @xmath21 analogous to the equation of motion of a particle in a potential .    the quantity @xmath18 is still an unknown . to determine it we note that if the motion of a notional particle according to ( [ poisson 2 ] ) starts at @xmath22 then it will increase monotonically to @xmath18 if the sagdeev potential is zero at @xmath18 and negative when @xmath2 lies between zero and @xmath18 .",
    "so the condition that the value of @xmath18 be consistent with the system dynamics is that @xmath23 an equation which determines @xmath24 the dimensionless parameters governing the system are @xmath5 and @xmath25 and it can soon be found that not all combinations of these yield a system in which the sagdeev potential has a zero for positive @xmath2 and is negative in the interval @xmath26 .",
    "the complicated nature of the sagdeev potential and its dependence on the unknown quantity @xmath18 mean that we are unable to make any analytic progress in determining the parameter range for which a suitable potential exists .",
    "the observations we make on this are determined by numerical experimentation , taking @xmath27 .",
    "it is found that an acceptable solution only exists if the electron temperature is sufficiently high .",
    "we have found that a value of _ t _ of around @xmath28 or more is needed and with this value and @xmath29 we obtain the sagdeev potential of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "= 15 , @xmath5=4.5.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in our normalized units the ion sound mach number is @xmath30 in this case 1.162 . for this value of @xmath25",
    "it appears that an acceptable solution only exists in a narrow range of mach numbers between about 1.13 and 1.19    if the sagdeev potential was the same downstream of the point where the potential reaches its maximum then we would just get a standard solitary wave solution , symmetric about this maximum .",
    "however , in the downstream region there is no reflected component and the second term in ( [ ion density ] ) is absent .",
    "this changes the sagdeev potential and in the downstream region the notional particle motion which determines the solution is oscillation in a potential well .",
    "a composite solution can be obtained by starting at the maximum , with zero potential gradient and integrating upstream and downstream with the appropriate charge densities in ( [ poisson ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure 2 , with the distance @xmath31 in units of the ion thermal velocity divided by the ion plasma frequency .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    if some dissipation were introduced then the notional particle would end up at the minimum of the potential well , corresponding to decaying oscillations on the downstream side and a shock like structure as described by sagdeev @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the solution is very sensitive to small changes in the charge density . in this case",
    "the density as @xmath32 on the upstream side goes to 1.0019 , so that very few ions are reflected , but there is nevertheless a radical change in the nature of the solution between the upstream and downstream sides . for higher electron to ion temperature ratios",
    "the mach number can be larger leading to a higher percentage of reflected ions as will be shown in the next section .",
    "to explore the possible relevance to a laser fusion pellet compression we can do a similar calculation with a 50/50 mixture of deuterium and tritium upstream . with the potential and flow speed normalised in terms of the deuterium thermal velocity",
    "the ion density is half the expression in ( [ ion density ] ) plus a corresponding tritium contribution in which @xmath2 is replaced with @xmath33 to take account of the higher mass .",
    "the calculation then goes through as before but we find that an acceptable solution only appears to exist for somewhat higher values of @xmath25 . for @xmath34 and @xmath35 corresponding to a mach number of 1.06 , we get the solution shown in figure  [ fig3 ] . the corresponding electric field , normalized to @xmath36 is shown in figure 4 .     and",
    "@xmath37,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    now let us relate these normalized values to physical parameters .",
    "if we assume that @xmath38 then we have for the electric field and length scale @xmath39    if we look at the d - t result given above and assume an ion temperature of 500 ev and density @xmath40 m@xmath41 then we get a peak electric field of @xmath42 v / m and , taking the normalized length of the main potential ramp to be 50 , corresponding to a length of 83 nm .",
    "these parameters are in striking agreement with those quoted by amendt et al @xcite .",
    "note that because of the restricted range of mach numbers within which these structures exist there is little scope for changing these values by adjusting the mach number .",
    "also there is a fairly weak dependence on density and ion temperature so that the orders of magnitude will remain in general agreement over a wide range of parameters .",
    "the main requirement is a high electron temperature compared to the ion temperature , a condition likely to be satisfied in high power laser plasma interactions .",
    "going back to the early experiments of taylor et al @xcite we can take this example and , instead of scaling to a high temperature , high density fusion target scale it to their ion temperature of around @xmath43 ev and density of around @xmath44 m@xmath41 .",
    "the resulting distance between the first two potential peaks is around 5 mm , again in excellent agreement with the observations .",
    "now let us look at the results of haberberger et al @xcite mentioned above , where they attribute ion beams well collimated in energy to a shock wave in an expanding plasma .",
    "the electron temperature they find is about an mev and we will assume that the already heated and expanding ions are at 2 kev , so that @xmath45 . the potential in this case , with a mach number of 1.38 is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .     and",
    "mach number 1.38.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the normalized length scale is again about 50 which translates into a physical length of about @xmath46 @xmath47 m if we take @xmath48 m@xmath41 , while the peak electric field is around @xmath49 v / m , to compare with the experimental results , we look at the energy spectrum of the reflected ions . adding the measured expansion velocity of @xmath50 to the reflected ion velocity we get the spectrum shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "this bears a striking resemblance to the experimental results , not only in the width of the spectrum and its energy but even in the detailed shape with a sharp edge on the high side .",
    "the density of reflected ions is about 36% of the background ion density , though this can go down if the mach number is reduced .",
    "again we should point out that because of the limited range of possible mach numbers and the weak dependence of the physical values on the plasma parameters , we do not have a great deal of freedom to adjust parameters so that our results lie in the correct range .",
    "the result given here appears to match the experiment much better than the computer simulation shown in the haberberger et al @xcite paper .",
    "one possible explanation is that the shock in the simulation has been launched with larger mach number of about 2 .",
    "this is well above the limit beyond which our laminar solutions do not exist ( around 1.4 ) , so it may be that what is being seen is some kind of turbulent shock , producing a much broader spectrum of fast ions .",
    "going back to the early simulations of forslund and freidberg @xcite we see just this behaviour with the sort of structure we describe at low mach number but a change to a more complex dissipative structure with many more reflected ions at higher mach numbers .",
    "our results suggest that what is seen in the experiment is the result of a low mach number laminar structure rather than a higher mach number dissipative shock .",
    "in conclusion , we have given a simple analytic description of laminar shock structures in unmagnetized plasmas and shown that the theory , despite its simplicity , can provide an explanation of results from important recent experiments on high power laser plasma interactions .",
    "it explains the existence of very high electric fields in inertial fusion targets and should be useful in guiding developments in the use of lasers to produce high quality energetic ion beams . on a more fundamental level",
    "there is a large body of literature on solitary waves where a heavy component , whether ions or dust , is assumed cold .",
    "including thermal effects , in the way done here could lead to a reappraisal of these structures .    in future work",
    "we intend to investigate the conditions under which different types of collisionless shock can be generated in laser plasmas .",
    "a better understanding of these should help efforts to eliminate them where they produce unwanted effects or to better control them when they give useful effects like ion acceleration .",
