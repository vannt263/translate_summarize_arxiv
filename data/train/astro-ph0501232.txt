    "we present a discussion of possible sources of c , o , and si in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) with particular consideration of very massive ( @xmath8 ) stars ( vmss ) and type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) .",
    "it is now well established that there is a substantial inventory of metals in the general igm over a wide range of redshift @xmath95.5 ( e.g. , songaila 2001 ; pettini et al .",
    "detailed studies of the data over @xmath104.1 by schaye et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and aguirre et al .",
    "( 2004 ) show that at a given density the abundances of c and si follow a lognormal distribution with substantial scatter .",
    "both the median and the scatter of the distribution are dependent on the density but nearly independent of @xmath5 . using observations at @xmath11 simcoe ,",
    "sargent , & rauch ( 2004 ) also found lognormal distributions for c and o. as only the ions , , and are directly measured , the inferred elemental abundances and in particular the relative abundances of c , o , and si are sensitive to the model of uv background ( uvb ) used ( e.g. , giroux & shull 1997 ) .",
    "we will use the results for two common uvb models adopted by the above two groups ( see table 1 ) .",
    "for uvb model q including quasars only , schaye et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found the average c abundance in the igm to be [ c / h]@xmath12 over the density range of the data used ( @xmath13 to 1.8 with @xmath14 being the density relative to the cosmic mean ) and up to [ c / h]@xmath15 when extrapolated to higher densities . the corresponding [ si / c]@xmath1 is @xmath16 ( aguirre et al .",
    "there is no evidence for evolution of either [ c / h]@xmath1 or [ si / c]@xmath1 over @xmath104.1 covered by the data . for a similar uvb model , simcoe et al .",

    "( 2004 ) found [ c / o]@xmath22 and a median abundance of [ c / h ]  @xmath23 , which would correspond to [ c / h]@xmath24 for a lognormal distribution with the same scatter of 0.75 dex as for model q. for both models q and qg , the results of the two groups for [ c / h]@xmath1 are in good agreement .",
    "note that model q gives higher values for [ c / h]@xmath1 and much higher values for [ c / o]@xmath1 and [ si / c]@xmath1 than model qg ( see table 1 ) .",
    "considering uncertainties in both the measurements and uvb models , the average abundances in the igm are rather high with [ o / h]@xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "the c / o and si / c ratios in the igm do not appear to vary with density ( simcoe et al .",
    "2004 ; aguirre et al .",
    "both [ c / h]@xmath1 and [ si / c]@xmath1 appear to be independent of @xmath5 over at least the range of @xmath104.1 .",
    "an important question is when the metal inventory of the igm was provided . at present we know that this inventory was achieved prior to @xmath27 .",
    "metal ejection from both low - mass ( @xmath28@xmath29 ) halos at early epochs ( @xmath3 ) and intermediate - mass ( @xmath30@xmath31 ) halos at later epochs ( @xmath32 ) will be discussed .",
    "the stellar sources of these metals are also not known but vmss and sne ii are assumed to be the plausible candidates . we earlier proposed a prompt metal inventory from vmss ( e.g. , wasserburg & qian 2000 ) . using estimates of this inventory and yields of heger & woosley [ 2002 ( hw ) ] , oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that vmss could be the source of reionization ( cf .",
    ", venkatesan & truran 2003 ) .",
    "it will be shown that if the igm inventory was obtained at early epochs , the required metal production rate for vmss and zero - metallicity sne ii in low - mass halos is much higher than the galactic rate .",
    "in contrast , the bulk of the igm inventory can be provided at later epochs by low - metallicity sne ii in intermediate - mass halos through efficient outflows for a galactic metal production rate .",
    "however , in all cases and for all the stellar models considered there is a problem in accounting for the elemental ratios inferred for the igm from uvb model q. it will be shown that the ratios from model qg can be matched with significant contributions from vmss . in particular , the si / c ratio reported for the igm appears to require a blend of contributions from both vmss and sne ii if salpeter initial mass functions ( imfs ) are assumed for these sources .",
    "we will not consider the contributions from intermediate - mass ( @xmath33@xmath34 ) stars in the following discussion .",
    "such stars are thought to be an important source of c in the galaxy on timescales of @xmath35 gyr , thereby contributing to the increase of [ c / o ] in galactic stars from @xmath36 at [ o / h ]  @xmath37 to @xmath38 at [ o / h ]  @xmath38 ( akerman et al .",
    "clearly , the delayed c contributions from intermediate - mass stars can be ignored for enrichment of the igm at early epochs ( @xmath3 or @xmath39 gyr since the big bang ) .",
    "the precise epoch where intermediate - mass stars contribute to the igm is not known . however , there is no evidence for evolution of either [ c / h]@xmath1 or [ si / c]@xmath1 over at least the range of @xmath104.1 ( schaye et al .",
    "2003 ; aguirre et al .",
    "therefore , we will only consider vmss and sne ii as the possible sources for metals in the igm .",
    "as intermediate - mass stars produce c but no si , the requirement of vms contributions to account for the rather high [ si / c]@xmath1 will be strengthened by any possible contributions from intermediate - mass stars .",
    "we first explore the possibility that the metal inventory in the igm is the result of astration ( i.e. , star formation ) in low - mass ( @xmath40@xmath29 ) halos at @xmath4130 .",
    "it is widely recognized that the first stars were formed in low - mass halos where gas could cool by h@xmath0 molecules when the virial temperature @xmath42 reached @xmath43 k ( e.g. , couchman & rees 1986 ) .",
    "haiman , rees , & loeb ( 1997 ) showed that the soft uvb produced by the first massive stars could dissociate h@xmath0 molecules in low - mass halos universally before the igm was reionized .",
    "dissociation of h@xmath0 molecules drastically changes the condition for onset of astration to @xmath44 k as required for cooling by atomic species .",
    "this condition then governs astration for all subsequent epochs including that of reionization .",
    "ciardi , ferrara , & abel ( 2000 ) showed that universal h@xmath0 dissociation has not yet taken place for @xmath45 .",
    "while the actual domain of astration by h@xmath0 cooling remains to be established , we consider the regime of @xmath4130 to be within current estimates .",
    "our purpose is to explore if such astration could possibly provide the metals in the igm and what metal production rates are required to achieve this .",
    "the nature of the first stars made of big bang debris is not known .",
    "they may be vmss ( see abel , bryan , & norman 2003 ; bromm & larson 2004 for reviews ) .",
    "on the other hand , the discovery of a low - mass star with [ fe / h ]  @xmath46 ( christlieb et al .",
    "2002 ) suggests that low - mass stars may have formed very early ( e.g. , schneider et al . 2003 ) and presumably a broader spectrum of normal stars including sn ii progenitors might be expected for the first stars . in either case",
    ", the occurrence of a vms or sn ii in a low - mass halo would disrupt the baryonic gas in the halo and disperse it into the igm on some scale . to estimate the range of low - mass halos with gas expulsion , we use models of hierarchical structure formation in the standard cold dark matter cosmology as discussed in barkana & loeb ( 2001 ) .",
    "a critical parameter for halo evolution is the virial temperature @xmath42 of the gas . for @xmath47 , @xmath42",
    "is related to the halo mass @xmath48 ( mostly in dark matter ) as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mean atomic weight and @xmath51 or 0.6 for a neutral or ionized gas , respectively , with a primordial composition of h and he .",
    "we assume that astration starts when the gas reaches a threshold virial temperature @xmath52 for cooling .",
    "for h@xmath0 cooling we will take @xmath53 k ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "another critical parameter is the gas binding energy @xmath54 . for @xmath47 , @xmath55",
    "we assume that all the gas would be expelled from the halo by an sn ii or vms with an explosion energy @xmath56 if @xmath57 ( e.g. , bromm , yoshida , & hernquist 2003 ) and retained for @xmath58 . for illustration , we take @xmath59 erg for sne ii and @xmath60 erg for vmss ( hw ) .    for a halo associated with an @xmath61 density fluctuation ( an @xmath61 halo ) ,",
    "the growth of its mass @xmath62 as a function of @xmath5 is prescribed by the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ; see fig . 6 in barkana & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "astration starts in a @xmath63 halo when the halo mass reaches @xmath64 at @xmath65 .",
    "the gas in the halo would be expelled by an sn ii until the halo mass grows to @xmath66 at @xmath67 or by a vms until @xmath68 at @xmath69 . in general , at a given @xmath5 an @xmath70 halo would reach @xmath71 to start astration and an @xmath72 halo would reach @xmath73 to greatly hinder gas expulsion . at any given @xmath5",
    "all @xmath61 halos with @xmath74 corresponding to @xmath75 have started astration but will be disrupted by an sn ii or vms .",
    "the relevant range of halos at @xmath76 corresponds to @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) for sne ii or @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) for vmss .",
    "for a given @xmath5 , the fraction @xmath81 of all matter in @xmath61 halos with @xmath74 is @xmath82 the function @xmath81 for @xmath53 k and @xmath83 erg is very close to that for the same @xmath52 but @xmath84 erg as halos with @xmath85 erg are extremely rare for @xmath86 .",
    "a fraction @xmath87% to 5% of all matter is in low - mass halos with gas expulsion at @xmath88 to 15 .",
    "we now estimate enrichment of the igm by gas expulsion from low - mass halos using o as a representative element .",
    "we consider a large reference region of the universe and treat it as a closed homogeneous system .",
    "we assume that the expelled gas is immediately mixed with the entire igm of the reference region . in this case , the number ratio ( o / h)@xmath1 of o to h atoms in the igm as a function of time @xmath89 ( since the big bang ) is determined by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the o production rate in an @xmath61 halo and the sum extends over all the @xmath61 halos with @xmath74 in the reference region .",
    "we explicitly assume that @xmath91 is proportional to the number ( h)@xmath92 of h atoms in the gas of the @xmath61 halo , @xmath93 for @xmath94 , the majority of the h atoms in the reference region reside in the igm and the majority of the h atoms in a halo reside in the gas .",
    "this gives @xmath95 the constant parameter @xmath96 is related to the frequency of occurrence ( @xmath97 ) for the o source in a halo of mass @xmath48 as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the solar mass fraction of o , @xmath100 is the baryonic mass fraction for the halo , and @xmath101 is the average o yield of the source . equation ( [ ot ] ) can be integrated to give @xmath102 where @xmath103^{3/2}\\ { \\rm gyr}$ ] for the adopted cosmology and @xmath104 .",
    "the above treatment is readily extended to mixtures from different sources .",
    "the result for [ o / h]@xmath105 as a function of @xmath5 is shown in figure 1 for @xmath106 using @xmath53 k for @xmath107 and @xmath83 erg for @xmath108 ( solid curve ) .",
    "replacing the mass range @xmath75 with @xmath109 gives essentially the same result ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "the rate @xmath106 is representative of o production by sne ii in the galaxy [ the solar o abundance is produced by sne ii over @xmath110 gyr ] . for this rate [ o / h]@xmath111 at @xmath112 .",
    "so sne ii in low - mass halos can not provide the igm inventory with a nominal abundance of [ o / h]@xmath113 unless the relevant production rate is 16 times higher than the galactic rate .",
    "the requirement of @xmath114 would also apply to any other sources ( including vmss ) if they were to produce the igm inventory at early epochs .",
    "simulations by norman , oshea , and paschos ( 2004 ) appear to suggest that vmss could not enrich the igm to the level of [ o / h]@xmath25 .",
    "however , this result was based on putting one vms in each halo with @xmath115 that was found in a simulation volume of 1 mpc@xmath116 at @xmath112 .",
    "the number of such halos found in the simulation volume may not be statistically representative ( m. l. norman , personal communication ) .",
    "future numerical studies on early enrichment of the igm by vmss or any other sources should use larger simulation volumes to check the required metal production rate against the value given here .",
    "we next consider contributions to the igm from just galactic outflows at @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that only normal stars including sne ii progenitors are formed and astration starts when @xmath117 k ( @xmath118 ) is reached for cooling by atomic species .",
    "the halo mass at the onset of astration ranges from @xmath119 for @xmath112 to @xmath120 for @xmath121 . for these masses @xmath122 erg",
    "so an sn ii can not expel all the gas from the halo .",
    "subsequent to the onset of astration , we assume that a fraction @xmath123 of the metals produced by sne ii is lost from the halo and injected broadly into the igm until the halo reaches a cutoff mass @xmath124 . while the dependence of @xmath123 on the halo mass may be complicated , we will treat it as a constant to determine how efficient mass loss must be to provide the igm inventory prior to @xmath121 . applying the same formalism leading to equation ( [ zo ] )",
    ", we have @xmath125 where @xmath126 gyr is the time corresponding to @xmath112 . using @xmath106 and @xmath127 ,",
    "we show [ o / h]@xmath105 as a function of @xmath5 for @xmath128 and @xmath31 ( short and long dashed curves ) , respectively , in figure 1 .",
    "these @xmath124 values are consistent with observations of outflows from lyman break and dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , pettini et al .",
    "2001 ; martin , kobulnicky , & heckman 2002 ) .",
    "values of @xmath129 give almost the same result as @xmath130 .",
    "figure 1 gives [ o / h]@xmath131 at @xmath121 for @xmath130 .",
    "thus to achieve [ o / h]@xmath25 at @xmath121 by just galactic outflows requires a rather high but still reasonable @xmath132 for a galactic metal production rate of @xmath106 or an equivalent @xmath133 gyr@xmath134 . obviously , smaller values of @xmath135 are required if galactic outflows are to provide some significant portions but not all of the igm inventory ( see  4 ) .",
    "the results for @xmath136 in   2 and 3 can be extended to other elements using the relevant production rates . for two elements",
    "e and e@xmath137 , @xmath138 where @xmath139 in the above equation @xmath140 is the mass in units of @xmath141 for the source with @xmath142 and @xmath143 being the lower and upper limits , @xmath144 is the yield of element e as a function of @xmath140 , and @xmath145 is the imf .",
    "we assume a salpeter imf ( @xmath146 ) for sne ii . as there is no a priori knowledge on the mass distribution of vmss , a wide range of imfs with @xmath146 , 10 , and 20",
    "are explored .",
    "this allows us to examine a wide range of abundance ratios of si and fe relative to c and o resulting from vms sources .",
    "the average yields @xmath147 for c , o , si , and fe and the corresponding [ c / o ] , [ si / c ] , and [ o / fe ] are given in table 2 for a number of models of vmss [ umeda & nomoto 2002 ( un ) ; hw ] and sne ii [ woosley & weaver 1995 ( ww ) ; un ; chieffi & limongi 2004 ( cl ) ] for the @xmath148 values considered .",
    "clearly , the elemental ratio e / e@xmath137 for a source only depends on those stars with finite yields of e and e@xmath137 .",
    "for this reason , we give the limiting masses for metal production as @xmath142 and @xmath143 in table 2 .",
    "although some vmss or sne ii may form outside this mass range , they do not affect the calculation of the elemental ratios .",
    "table 2 shows that vmss have a narrow range of [ c / o ]  @xmath149 to @xmath150 for a wide range of imfs but their [ si / c ] varies from 1.181.30 for a salpeter imf to 0.610.84 for an imf with @xmath151 that very strongly favors the lower masses .",
    "this is because the c and o yields are nearly constant for all contributing vmss while the si yield increases significantly ( the fe yield increases steeply ) with mass ( un ; hw ) .",
    "in contrast , models of zero - metallicity sne ii ( ww ; un ; cl ) give narrow ranges of [ c / o ]  @xmath152 to 0.02 and [ si / c ]  @xmath1530.17 . for sne ii with very low to solar metallicities , ww give [ c / o ]  @xmath154 and [ si / c ]  @xmath1550.50 while cl give [ c / o ]  @xmath156 and [ si / c ]  @xmath1570.28 .",
    "we consider that sne ii in the regime of low metallicities are relevant to the problem at hand . in all cases ,",
    "[ si / c ] is high for vmss but low for sne ii with zero or low metallicities .",
    "it is the high value of [ si / c]@xmath1 that indicates significant vms contributions as noted by aguirre et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( see also schaerer 2002 ) . as vmss have [ si / c ]",
    "@xmath158  [ si / c]@xmath1 while sne ii have [ si / c ]  @xmath159  [ si / c]@xmath1 , this supports the existence of vms contributions but was not discussed in the recent critique of vms models by tumlinson , venkatesan , and shull ( 2004 ) .",
    "we first compare the elemental ratios from stellar models with [ c / o]@xmath17 and [ si / c]@xmath160 inferred from uvb model q. neither vmss nor sne ii of any metallicity can account for both [ c / o]@xmath1 and [ si / c]@xmath1 . as [ c / o ] is close to [ c / o]@xmath1 for sne ii of zero metallicity ( or all metallicities according to cl ) and [ si / c ] is close to [ si / c]@xmath1 for vmss with a salpeter imf , one may consider a mixture from these two sources .",
    "however , to approximately match [ c / o]@xmath1 would require that almost all of the c come from sne ii and this would give a [ si / c ] for the mixture essentially equal to the sn ii value , which is off by @xmath161 dex from the igm value .",
    "similarly , matching [ si / c]@xmath1 would require that almost all of the c come from vmss , thus giving a very low [ c / o ] for the mixture .",
    "so in all cases and for all the stellar models there is a problem in accounting for the elemental ratios inferred from uvb model q.    we now consider uvb model qg with [ c / o]@xmath162 and [ si / c]@xmath163 .",
    "these ratios can not be matched by vmss with a salpeter imf , for which [ si / c ]  @xmath164 .",
    "a match can be obtained for vmss if an imf very strongly favoring the lower masses is used ( see models 2b , 1c , and 2c in table 2 ) . it is also possible to obtain a match with both [ c / o]@xmath1 and [ si / c]@xmath1 for uvb model qg if we consider mixtures of vms and sn ii contributions . as the largest [ si / c ]  @xmath165 for vmss ( model 1a ) and the largest [ si / c ]  @xmath166 for sne ii of low metallicity ( model 6 ) , to match [ si / c]@xmath163 requires a fraction of at least @xmath167 of the c to come from vmss .",
    "below we discuss four representative cases , all of which match [ c / o]@xmath1 and [ si / c]@xmath1 for uvb model qg to within 0.1 dex ( see table 3 ) .    in case",
    "i the igm inventory was produced by just vmss ( imf with @xmath151 ) in low - mass halos at early epochs ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "a high metal production rate of @xmath168 gyr@xmath134 is required to achieve [ o / h]@xmath25 (  2 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a frequency of occurrence @xmath169 gyr@xmath134 ( eq . [ [ freq ] ] for @xmath170 ) so that every halo of @xmath171 would have formed @xmath33 vms by @xmath112 ( @xmath126 gyr ) .",
    "this rate is usually considered the upper limit for vms formation as the uv irradiation from a vms suppresses further astration in its hosting halo ( e.g. , couchman & rees 1986 ) .",
    "case i does not allow any significant contributions to the igm from galactic outflows at later epochs ( @xmath32 ) . this appears to be in conflict with observations of outflows from lyman break and dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , pettini et al .",
    "2001 ; martin et al . 2002 ) .",
    "it is also at odds with the attribution of the bulk of the igm inventory to galactic outflows as advocated by many previous studies ( e.g. , madau , ferrara , & rees 2001 ; scannapieco , ferrara , & madau 2002 ; thacker , scannapieco , & davis 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , bromm & loeb ( 2003 ) suggested that vmss may form only for metallicities below [ c / h ]  @xmath172 and [ o / h ]  @xmath173 .",
    "however , for case i vmss are required to provide [ c / h ]  @xmath174 and [ o / h ]  @xmath175 , which are much beyond the suggested termination point for their formation .    in case ii",
    "the sources for metals in the igm are a combination of vmss and zero - metallicity sne ii in low - mass halos at early epochs .",
    "a single salpeter imf ( @xmath146 ) is used for the mass range covering both vmss and sne ii . to achieve [ o / h]@xmath25 requires @xmath176 gyr@xmath134 and @xmath177 gyr@xmath134 .",
    "the latter is 7 times greater than the galactic value .",
    "thus case ii requires high metal production rates for both vmss and zero - metallicity sne ii . as in case i , case ii does not allow significant contributions from galactic outflows and requires vmss to provide enrichments beyond the suggested termination point for their formation .    for cases iii and",
    "iv we consider a combination of early contributions from vmss ( imf with @xmath178 for case iii and salpeter imf for case iv ) and later galactic outflows driven by low - metallicity sne ii .",
    "case iii is chosen to match [ si / c]@xmath21 exactly .",
    "the required rate of @xmath179 gyr@xmath134 is high but the required galactic outflows with an efficiency of @xmath127 for a galactic rate of @xmath180 gyr@xmath134 ( for @xmath130 , see  3 ) are quite reasonable .",
    "case iii also requires vmss to provide [ c / h ]  @xmath181 and [ o / h ]  @xmath182 , which are in excess of the termination metallicities for their formation as suggested by bromm & loeb ( 2003 ) .",
    "case iv was calculated using @xmath183 , which requires vmss to provide metals only up to the suggested termination point , and hence , a much smaller rate of @xmath184 gyr@xmath134 .",
    "the required efficiency of galactic outflows is @xmath185 for a galactic @xmath186 .",
    "if we instead had required an exact match to [ si / c]@xmath1 for case iv , then @xmath187 with no major difference in the results .",
    "the results in table 3 show that vmss must be significant contributors to the igm based on the [ si / c]@xmath1 value and that either a pure vms source with an extreme imf or a blend of vms and sn ii sources could provide the observed metal inventory in the igm",
    ". however , case iv appears to be the best scenario if we require ( 1 ) major contributions from galactic outflows , ( 2 ) a galactic @xmath186 , ( 3 ) a nonextreme imf for vmss , and ( 4 ) strict termination metallicities for vms formation as suggested by bromm & loeb ( 2003 ) . in case",
    "iv vmss in low - mass halos provided 15% of the c , 20% of the o , and 51% of the si prior to h@xmath0 dissociation and reionization , and the rest of the igm inventory was provided by later efficient outflows driven by sne ii in intermediate - mass halos .",
    "this suggests that vmss must be substantial contributors to the igm with high frequencies of occurrences at very high @xmath5 .",
    "venkatesan & truran ( 2003 ) calculated that vmss would provide 10 h - ionizing photons per baryon in order to reach [ o / h]@xmath24 .",
    "so the vmss in case iv would provide @xmath188 h - ionizing photons per baryon in reaching [ o / h ]  @xmath181 ( using c gives the same result .",
    "note that the value of 0.35 h - ionizing photons per baryon given in venkatesan & truran 2003 assumes a termination metallicity of [ o / h ]  @xmath189 for vms formation ) .",
    "this may be consistent with the `` weak '' version of the vms scenario discussed in tumlinson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "so far our discussion has focused on c , o , and si as these elements are measured in the igm .",
    "the abundances of other elements such as fe can also be calculated for the four cases discussed above .",
    "the o and fe yields in table 2 give [ o / fe ]  @xmath190 and 0.52 for cases i and iii , respectively , and [ o / fe ]  @xmath191 for cases ii and iv ( see table 3 ) . for [ o / h]@xmath25 , this implies [ fe / h]@xmath192 and @xmath193 for cases i and iii , respectively , and [ fe / h]@xmath194 for cases ii and iv . observations of metal - poor stars in the galaxy ( e.g. , cayrel et al .",

    "cases i and iii are consistent with these observations .",
    "however , the [ o / fe ] value for cases ii and iv is too low compared with those observed in metal - poor stars .",
    "this may be a potentially important problem for these two cases , especially for case iv , which satisfies all the other criteria discussed above .",
    "the low [ o / fe ] value for cases ii and iv is mostly due to the low values of [ o / fe ]  @xmath198 given by sn ii models .",
    "we note that the fe yields of sne ii were not calculated a priori but generated by employing largely artificial mass cuts in all models .",
    "stellar observations ( e.g. , nissen et al .",
    "2002 ) show that [ o / fe ]  @xmath199 for the regime of @xmath200}<-1.5 $ ] , where sne ii are clearly the dominant source for both o and fe .",
    "this indicate that the calculated average fe yields of sne ii are a factor of @xmath7 too high .",
    "much work is required to resolve the problem of fe yields and the associated uncertainties in [ o / fe ] for sn ii models .",
    "we also note that our next best case iii gives an adequate [ o / fe ] but requires vmss to provide [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] somewhat beyond the termination metallicities suggested by bromm & loeb ( 2003 ) . if the criteria for termination of vms formation could be relaxed , then case iii may be a viable alternative to case iv in accounting for the igm data and stellar observations .    clearly , the results presented here are subject to uncertainties in theoretical models of stellar yields and in igm measurements and analyses .",
    "possible uncertainties are unlikely to explain the large discrepancies between stellar models and the elemental ratios from uvb model q but may affect some of our results regarding model qg . as discussed above , uncertainties in fe yields of sn ii models affect the [ o / fe ] values for cases ii and iv .",
    "in addition , the required rates quoted above ( see table 3 ) correspond to a nominal abundance of [ o / h]@xmath25 and would change if different values were used . for this nominal value all four cases considered ( including case i for a pure vms source ) imply [ fe / h]@xmath201 ( using [ o / fe ]  @xmath202 instead of 0.12 for cases ii and iv does not change the result ) .",
    "this is high considering a number of ultra - metal - poor stars in the galaxy have @xmath203  [ fe / h ]  @xmath204 ( e.g. , christlieb 2003 ) .",
    "one possible explanation would be that those ultra - metal - poor stars formed in small halos in under - enriched regions and were later accreted into the galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with the large scatter for the lognormal distribution of metal abundances in the igm and with the standard model of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "the above issues and the general problem of relating abundances in the igm to those in metal - poor stars remain to be addressed .    in summary , we find that vmss must be significant contributors to the igm .",
    "our preferred scenario is that vmss provided between 15% ( case iv ) and 60% ( case iii ) of the c ( and corresponding levels of other metals ) in the igm by disrupting the gas in low - mass ( @xmath40@xmath29 ) halos at very high redshift ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "outflows driven by sne ii in intermediate - mass ( @xmath30@xmath31 ) halos provided the remainder ( the bulk in case iv ) of the metals during later epochs ( @xmath4 , see fig .",
    "1 ) . thus , there is a large gap in @xmath5 between metal production by vmss very early in the chemical evolution of the igm and subsequent contributions from galactic outflows .",
    "the metals from these two different sources appear to be well mixed locally but have a wide range in net abundances as established by schaye et al .",
