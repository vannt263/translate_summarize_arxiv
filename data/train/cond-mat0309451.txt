    "the transverse flux penetrates independent of the in - plane magnetic field as in bi2212 system .",
    "the obtained results can be understood within the concept of the flux line melting giving rise to the transition of 3d correlated stacks of pancakes at @xmath34 into a disordered phase of 2d ones at @xmath31 .",
    "the results obtained in the present study confirms the existence of strong 3d correlations in the flux line structure in bi2212:pb at @xmath34 . really ,",
    "the creep assistant penetration rate along the applied in - plane magnetic field is significantly higher than that across this direction , that is , the activation barrier for the flux line penetration transverse to @xmath28 is higher than the barrier along it .",
    "the fact that the relaxation rate of the screening currents along the in - plane field is lower than the current relaxation in the perpendicular direction supports the above conclusion . in our experiments we cool the sample in the in - plane field ( field cooled regime ) .",
    "under such a condition , the in - plane structure of the flux lines arises in the sample .",
    "the in - plane vortices should evidently locate preferably between cuo planes .",
    "@xcite the applied transverse magnetic field @xmath53 , induces the entering of the flux lines directed transverse with respect to the sample plane .",
    "the penetrating flux lines should intersect the in - plane vortices when moving in the direction perpendicular to @xmath28 . in the case of highly anisotropic ( layered )",
    "superconductors the transverse to the layers magnetic flux has a form of 2d pancake - like vortices .",
    "@xcite as a result , in such extremely anisotropic superconductors as bi2212 , the transverse magnetic flux enters the sample volume independently of the density and direction of the in - plane vortices .",
    "@xcite on the contrary , in the less anisotropic systems such as in ybco , the transverse magnetic flux penetrates preferably along the direction of the in - plane vortices since due to the strong superconducting coupling between cuo planes there exists an additional energy barrier for the intersection of the in - plane and transverse vortices .",
    "thus , we conclude that in bi2212:pb single crystals the pancakes in different cuo planes are strongly correlated at @xmath34 .    some unusual effect is observed in transverse magnetic flux relaxation .",
    "the magnetic field gradient across the in - plane field direction increases with time , then , the corresponding component of the screening current increases also .",
    "this effect could be explained as follows .",
    "the entering of the transverse magnetic flux near a weak point should be evidently accompanied by some redistribution of the in - plane magnetic induction .",
    "the in - plane field prevents the transverse vortex penetration .",
    "thus , due to the thermoactivated flux lines flow ( taff ) , a part of the in - plane vortices should be expelled from the region near the weak point to the periphery of the region penetrated by the transverse flux . as a result in this region",
    "some thickening of the in - plane vortices arises with time .",
    "the current screening the flux penetration across the direction of @xmath8 growths with the value of the in - plane magnetic induction .",
    "@xcite the described effect could be a reason for the found increase with time of the value @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( curve  2 ) ) .",
    "a rather interesting feature is the asymmetry of the flux creep rate with respect to the in - plane field direction described at the end of the previous section .",
    "this asymmetry can be attributed to the peculiarities of the defect structure of the studied samples .",
    "there are two types of characteristic planar defects in bi2212:pb system .",
    "the first one is system of twins .",
    "these defects are seen in polarized light and serves the weak points for the flux penetration in the studied single crystals .",
    "the second kind of planar defects in bi2212:pb is a so - called laminar structure.@xcite these defects revealed by means of x - ray diffraction are formed by modulation of the pb concentration .",
    "the laminar structure contributes to the total pinning force and the screening current density along the laminae is higher than the current density across them . in our samples",
    "the laminae are parallel to two of the sample edges and the current anisotropy along and across the laminae is about 1.52 , which is significantly lower than the in - plane magnetic field induced anisotropy .",
    "@xcite after the transverse field turning on , the flux penetrates the sample preferably along the in - plane magnetic field and later the smaller anisotropy due to lamina structure proves itself .",
    "the appearance of the asymmetry could be understood as follows .",
    "the interaction of the transverse vortices with the currents flowing in the superconductor gives rise to the existence of the forces which drives the magnetic flux into the sample bulk .",
    "the directions along the in - plane magnetic field and along the laminae are more favorable for the flux line motion . in the case of the in - plane field",
    "directed normal to the sample edge and , consequently , perpendicular to the laminar structure , the motion of the transverse flux to the left and to the right with respect to @xmath28 are equal .",
    "if there exists some angle @xmath42 between the in - plane field and the normal to the laminar structure , the left and right directions become unequal since the component of the driving force along the easy direction ( parallel to the laminae ) is different .",
    "this could give rise to the observed asymmetry .",
    "for illustration , we calculate below the value of the flux creep rate asymmetry using a simple model of taff .",
    "let us introduce a coordinate system @xmath54 with @xmath55 axis directed perpendicular the sample plane , @xmath40 axis along the in - plane field , and @xmath39 axis across it .",
    "the magnetic field has two components @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the components of the current in @xmath58 plane are @xmath59 the components of the lorentz s force acting on the transverse flux line can be written as follows @xmath60,\\ ] ] @xmath61,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the flux quantum , @xmath63 if the transverse field @xmath56 is directed in the positive direction and @xmath64 if @xmath56 is directed in the negative one , the value @xmath65 corresponds to the force component along the laminar structure , and @xmath66 is the force component across the laminae . following a standard approach  @xcite , we express the line velocity as a sum of taff probabilities for the flux line to move through a distance @xmath67 during a time interval @xmath68 down and against the lorentz force . as a result",
    ", we get for the components of the flux line velocity along and across the laminar structure @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 or @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the flux line length along @xmath55 axis , and @xmath74 are the effective pinning barriers for the flux line motion along and across the laminar structure .",
    "the component of the taff velocity @xmath75 transverse to the vector of the in - plane field is defined now by evident formula @xmath76 . at this point",
    "we could start with the analysis of the flux penetration asymmetry .",
    "however , for simplicity we linearized eq .",

    "if the in - plane magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the sample edge ( that is , @xmath85 ) , these lines moves in opposite directions with the same absolute values of the velocity components @xmath86 .",
    "if there exists in - plane anisotropy and the in - plane magnetic field deviates from the normal to the edge , then , the absolute values of the transverse velocity components are different and from eq .",
    "( [ transverse ] ) we find @xmath87 @xmath88 this asymmetry disappears at @xmath89 as it is observed in the experiment .",
    "the obtained result is based on the simplest possible model of taff and could not be used for a quantitative analysis .",
    "nevertheless , it describes the main features of the effect since the observed flux motion asymmetry follows from a general symmetry of the problem .",
    "the velocity asymmetry @xmath90 changes if we change the direction of one of the fields @xmath14 or @xmath28",
    ". really , in these cases the sign of the product @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ asym ] ) remains unchanged while the sign of @xmath92 changes .",
    "a simultaneous change of the signs of the both fields @xmath14 and @xmath28 does not affect the asymmetry value @xmath90 . as it follows from the experiment ,",
    "the change of the direction of one of the field changes the sign of the velocity difference @xmath90 .",
    "this means that @xmath93 .",
    "it is a natural result since the pinning of the flux lines lying in @xmath58 plane is usually higher than for the flux lines directed along @xmath94 axis .",
    "@xcite according to eq .",
    "( [ asym ] ) , the velocity asymmetry @xmath90 changes its sign if the angle between the in - plane field and the sample edge is changed from @xmath42 to @xmath95 , which also is in accordance with the experimental results .    besides the discussed above mechanism , the magnus force",
    "@xcite could be a reason for asymmetrical creep .",
    "however , in this case it would be impossible to explain the observed effect of the inclination angle @xmath42 on the creep rate .",
    "in addition , the magnus force should be small for an extreme type - ii superconductor .",
    "the best symmetry of the flux creep with respect to the in - plane field direction is attained in the experiments at inclination angles different from zero ( at @xmath42 about 4 @xmath46 ) .",
    "probably this is a consequence of magnus force influence on relaxation .    in conclusion ,",
