    "<S> the origin of the recently discovered large thermopower in hole - doped ptsb@xmath0 is theoretically analyzed based on a model constructed from first principles band calculation . it is found that the valence band dispersion has an overall flatness combined with some local ups and downs , which gives small fermi surfaces scattered over the entire brillouin zone . the seebeck coefficient is calculated using this model , which gives good agreement with the experiment . we conclude that the good thermoelectric property originates from this `` corrugated flat band '' , where the coexistence of large seebeck coefficient and large electric conductivity is generally expected .    </S>",
    "<S> good thermoelectric materials are those materials that can transform heat into electricity with high efficiency . the efficiency of thermoelectric materials is characterized by the dimensionless figure of merit , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the temperature , and @xmath3 with @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the seebeck coefficient , electric conductivity , and the thermal conductivity , respectively@xcite . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the product @xmath7 is called the power factor , and a material with large @xmath8 requires a large @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is known , however , that materials with large seebeck coefficient usually have small conductivity , so that good thermoelectric materials are often found in semiconducting materials with rather small amount of carriers .    in this context </S>",
    "<S> , the discovery of good thermoelectric properties in the sodium cobaltate na@xmath9coo@xmath0@xcite has been of special interest in that a large power factor is observed in a material with large amount of doped holes and thus metallic conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> there have been various theoretical studies on this material @xcite , and in particular , one of the present authors along with arita proposed that a peculiar band shape named the `` pudding mold type '' ( fig.[fig1](b ) ) is the origin of this coexistence of good conductivity and large thermopower@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely in a system having a band with flat portion at the top ( or bottom ) , connecting into a dispersive portion , the fermi level is kept close to the band edge upon doping , and this gives rise to a large group velocity difference between electrons and holes , resulting in a large seebeck coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time , the large group velocity of holes due to the dispersive portion of the band gives a large electric conductivity , and this combination results in a large power factor .        </S>",
    "<S> quite recently , nishikubo _ et al . _ discovered that doping holes into a cubic pyrite material ptsb@xmath0 by partially substituting pt by ir as pt@xmath10ir@xmath9sb@xmath0 gives rise to a coexistence of metallic conductivity and a large seebeck coefficient@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we present first principles band calculation result of ptsb@xmath0 , and analyze the origin of the good thermoelectric properties of this material . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the material has a valence band dispersion with an overall flatness but with some local ups and downs . </S>",
    "<S> this band structure , which we refer to as the `` corrugated flat band '' ( fig.[fig1](c ) ) , has some similarity with the pudding mold band in that they both have coexisting flatness and the large group velocity , but still is different from the pudding mold band in that the flatness extends over the entire brillouin zone , while the dispersiveness ( the corrugation ) is a local feature which appears at various points all over the brillouin zone .    . </S>",

    "<S> the bands near the fermi level mainly consists of sb @xmath13 orbitals , mixed with pt @xmath14 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the upper most valence band originates almost solely from sb @xmath13 orbitals , and the near absence of the @xmath12 orbital character , namely , the non - bonding nature ( non - bonding in the sense that @xmath11 does not mix with @xmath12 ) , makes this band relatively flat compared to other bands with @xmath13 character . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , this upper most valence band is not perfectly flat , and there are some ups and downs , which we will call `` corrugations '' . </S>",
    "<S> this corrugation give rise to small pocket like fermi surfaces when holes are doped as we shall see below .     at @xmath15k . </S>",

    "<S> we consider doping holes into this model assuming a rigid band , where the doping ratio @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the total band filling . in an ideal situation </S>",
    "<S> , this @xmath21 corresponds to the experimental substitution ratio @xmath22 . in fig.[fig3 ] , we show the fermi surface for three doping ratios . the combination of the overall flatness and the corrugation of the valence band results in multiple fermi surface pockets that are scattered over the entire brillouin zone .    based on this model </S>",

    "<S> @xmath31 is the fermi distribution function , and @xmath32 is the chemical potential determined from the band filling . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , we simply refer to @xmath33 as @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ( for diagonal @xmath25 ) as @xmath4 . using @xmath36 , </S>",
    "<S> conductivity can be given as @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> in fig.[fig4](a ) , we show the doping ratio dependence of the seebeck coefficient at @xmath15k . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the calculation results are in overall agreement with the experiment@xcite . in fig.[fig4](b ) , we show the temperature dependence of the seebeck coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> this is also in fair agreement with the experiment , although the steep increase at very low temperatures seen experimentally is not found in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the broad maximum at around @xmath38k observed for @xmath39 is roughly reproduced theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> this maximum is due to the presence of the conduction band lying close to the fermi level , which gives a negative contribution to the seebeck coefficient at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we will come back to this point later .    in fig.[fig4](c ) , we show the normalized power factor as a function of the doping . </S>",
    "<S> it can clearly be seen that a large power factor arises in the hole doped regime , where the fermi level lies in the corrugated flat band . </S>",
    "<S> this good thermoelectric property can be understood as follows . in metallic systems , where the fermi level lies within the energy bands </S>",
    "<S> , it is generally required to keep the fermi level close to the band edge in order to obtain a large seebeck coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the seebeck effect is caused by the difference of the group velocity between electrons and holes in the vicinity of the fermi level , and the two velocities differ largely ( the ratio of the group velocities above and below the fermi level is large ) near the band edge . </S>",
    "<S> however , keeping the fermi level close to the band edge usually means that the number of doped carriers is small , so that the absolute values of the group velocity and the volume of the fermi surface is both small , resulting in a small electric conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the case of the pudding mold band@xcite , the situation is largely different in the case of the corrugated flat band . as mentioned above , multiple fermi pockets are scattered over the entire brillouin zone due to the flatness of the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is schematically shown in fig.[fig1](c ) along with the case of a usual metal with a single fermi surface fig.[fig1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overall flatness of the bands and thus the large multiplicity of the fermi surface prevents the fermi level from quickly lowering upon hole doping , giving rise to a large seebeck coefficient even for large amount of hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time , the existence of multiple fermi surfaces together with a large group velocity due to the corrugation results in a large electric conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these effects results in a large power factor . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , in a corrugated flat band , the multi - valley effect seen in some of the thermoelectric semiconducting materials@xcite is enhanced in an ultimate way in that the overall flatness of the band extends over the entire brillouin zone .    as seen from the above </S>",
    "<S> , the corrugated flat band is indeed a favorable band structure for large thermopower , but there exists a flaw in the present material in that the conduction band lies too close to the valence band . </S>",
    "<S> the conduction band gives a negative contribution , so that the seebeck coefficient decreases at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> since the band gap opens between the nonbonding and the antibonding @xmath11-@xmath12 bands as shown in fig.[fig2](c ) , a larger band gap is expected to open for larger @xmath11-@xmath12 hybridization , where the bonding - antibonding splitting becomes large . to see this effect </S>",
    "<S> , we construct a 44 orbital model which explicitly considers 20 ( 5 orbitals @xmath17 4 sites ) pt @xmath14 and 24 sb @xmath13 orbitals , and increase all of the hopping integrals between @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbitals by a factor of 1.2 hypothetically by hand . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained band structure is shown in fig.[fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> for such a band structure , the seebeck coefficient continues to increase for high temperatures as shown in fig.[fig3](b ) ( dashed line ) .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the recently found good thermoelectric properties of ptsb@xmath0 is due to the presence of the corrugated flat band , which gives rise to multiple fermi pockets scattered over the entire brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> the flatness of the band originates from the non - bonding character of the sb @xmath11 band , while the corrugation of this band mainly comes from the direct @xmath11-@xmath11 hoppings . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicity of the fermi surface results in a coexistence of large seebeck coefficient and a good metallic conductivity , giving rise to a large power factor . </S>",
    "<S> the present mechanism for large power factor is rather general , and is expected to take place where bands with non - bonding character is present near the fermi level . despite the presence of the corrugated flat band , one flaw of ptsb@xmath0 is the narrowness of the band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the conduction band lying close to the valence band gives a negative conductivity to the seebeck coefficient at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that materials with the combination of a corrugated flat band along with a wider band gap should result in even more ideal thermoelectric properties . </S>"
