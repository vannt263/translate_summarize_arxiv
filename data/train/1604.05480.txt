    "<S> explicit energy - transport equations for the spinorial carrier transport in ferromagnetic semiconductors are calculated from a general spin energy - transport system that was derived by ben abdallah and el hajj from a spinorial boltzmann equation . </S>",
    "<S> the novelty of our approach are the simplifying assumptions leading to explicit models which extend both spin drift - diffusion and semiclassical energy - transport equations . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit models allow us to examine the interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the monotonicity of the entropy ( or free energy ) and gradient estimates are shown for these models and the existence of weak solutions to a time - discrete version of one of the models is proved , using novel truncation arguments . </S>",
    "<S> numerical experiments in one - dimensional multilayer structures using a finite - volume discretization illustrate the effect of the temperature and the polarization parameter . </S>"
