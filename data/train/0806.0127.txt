    "we will focus on ca s as realistic spatial models of ordinary ( non - quantum - coherent ) computation . as fredkin and banks pointed out@xcite",
    ", we can demonstrate the computing capability of a ca dynamics by showing that certain patterns of bits act like logic gates , like signals , and like wires , and that we can put these pieces together into an initial state that , under the dynamics , exactly simulates the logic circuitry of an ordinary computer .",

    "computation universal_. a ca may also be universal by being able to simulate the operation of a computer in a less efficient manner  never reusing any logic gates for example . a universal ca that can perform long iterative computations within a fixed volume of space",
    "is said to be a _ spatially efficient _ model of computation .",
    "we would like our ca models of computation to be as realistic as possible .",
    "they should accurately reflect important constraints on physical information processing .",
    "for this reason , one of the basic properties that we incorporate into our models is the microscopic reversibility of physical dynamics : there is always enough information in the microscopic state of a physical system to determine not only what it will do next , but also exactly what state it was in a moment ago .",
    "this means , in particular , that in reversible ca s ( as in physics ) we can never truly erase any information .",
    "this constraint , combined with energy conservation , allows reversible ca systems to accurately model thermodynamic limits on computation@xcite .",
    "conversely , reversible ca s are particularly useful for modeling thermodynamic processes in physics@xcite .",
    "reversible ca `` toy universes '' also tend to have long and interesting evolutions@xcite .",
    "all of the ca s discussed in this paper fall into a class of ca s called lattice gas automata ( lga ) , or simply lattice gases . these ca s are particularly well suited to physical modeling .",
    "it is very easy to incorporate constraints such as reversibility , energy conservation and momentum conservation into a lattice gas .",
    "lattice gases are known which , in their large - scale average behavior , reproduce the normal continuum differential equations of hydrodynamics@xcite . in a lattice gas , particles hop around from lattice site to lattice site .",
    "these models are of particular interest here because one can imagine that the particles move continuously between lattice sites in between the discrete ca time - steps .",
    "using lga s allows us to add energy and momentum conservation to our computational models , and also to make a direct connection with continuous classical mechanics .",
    "our discussion begins with the most realistic classical mechanical model of digital computation , fredkin s billiard ball model@xcite .",
    "we then describe related classical mechanical models which , unlike the bbm , are isomorphic to simple lattice gases at integer times . in the bbm , computations are constructed out of the elastic collisions of very incompressible spheres .",
    "our new 2d and 3d models are based on elastically colliding spheres that are instead very compressible , and hence take an appreciable amount of time to bounce off each other .",
    "the universality of these soft sphere models ( ssm s ) depends on the finite extent in time of the interaction , rather than its finite extent in space ( as in the bbm ) .",
    "this difference allows us to interpret these models as simple lga s . using the ssm s",
    ", we discuss computation in perfectly momentum conserving physical systems ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and show that we can compute just as efficiently in the face of this added constraint .",
    "the main difficulty here turns out to be reusing signal - routing resources .",
    "we then provide an alternative physical interpretation of the ssm s ( and of all mass and momentum conserving lga s ) as relativistic systems , and discuss some alternative relativistic ssm models .",
    "finally , we discuss the use of these kinds of models as semi - classical systems which embody realistic quantum limits on classical computation .",

    "his basic insight is that a location where balls may or may not collide acts like a logic gate : we get a ball coming out at certain places only if another ball did nt knock it away ! if the balls are used as signals , with the presence of a ball representing a logical `` 1 '' and the absence a logical `` 0 '' , then a place where signals intersect acts as a logic gate , with different logic functions of the inputs coming out at different places . figure",
    "[ fig.bbm]a illustrates the idea in more detail . for this to work right ,",
    "we need synchronized streams of data , with evenly spaced time - slots in which a 1 ( ball ) or 0 ( no ball ) may appear .",
    "when two 1 s impinge on the collision `` gate '' , they behave as shown in the figure , and they come out along the paths labeled .",
    "if a 1 comes in at but the corresponding slot at is empty , then that 1 makes it through to the path labeled ( and not ) . if sequences of such gates can be connected together with appropriate delays , the set of logic functions that appear at the outputs in figure  [ fig.bbm]a is sufficient to build any computer .    in order to guarantee composability of these logic gates , we constrain the initial state of the system .",
    "all balls are identical and are started at integer coordinates , with the unit of distance taken to be the diameter of the balls .",
    "this spacing is indicated in the figure by showing balls centered in the squares of a grid .",
    "all balls move at the same speed in one of four directions : up - right , up - left , down - right , or down - left .",
    "the unit of time is chosen so that at integer times , all freely moving balls are again found at integer coordinates .",
    "we arrange things so that balls always collide at right angles , as in figure  [ fig.bbm]a .",
    "such a collision leaves the colliding balls on the grid at the next integer time .",
    "figure  [ fig.bbm]b shows another allowed collision , in which the balls collide at half - integer times ( shown in gray ) but are still found on the grid at integer times .",
    "the signals leaving one collision - gate are routed to other gates using fixed mirrors , as shown in figure  [ fig.bbm]c .",
    "the mirrors are strategically placed so that balls are always found on the grid at integer times .",
    "since zeros are represented by no balls ( i.e. , gaps in streams of balls ) , zeros are routed just as effectively by mirrors as the balls themselves are .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig.bbm]d , we show how two signal streams are made to cross without interacting  this is needed to allow wires to cross in our logic diagrams . in the collision shown , if two balls come in , one each at and , then two balls come out on the same paths and with the same timing as they would have if they had simply passed straight through .",
    "needless to say , if one of the input paths has no ball , a ball on the other path just goes straight through . and",
    "if both inputs have no ball , we will certainly not get any balls at the outputs , so the zeros go straight through as well .",
    "clearly any computation that is done using the bbm is reversible , since if we were to simultaneously and exactly reverse the velocities of all balls , they would exactly retrace their paths , and either meet and collide or not at each intersection , exactly as they did going forward .",
    "even if we do nt actually reverse the velocities , we know that there is enough information in the present state to recover any earlier state , simply because we _ could _ reverse the dynamics .",
    "thus we have a classical mechanical system which , viewed at integer time steps , performs a discrete reversible digital process .",
    "the digital character of this model depends on more than just starting all balls at integer coordinates .",
    "we need to be careful , for example , not to wire two outputs together .",
    "this would result in head - on collisions which would not leave the balls on the grid at integer times !",
    "miswired logic circuits , in which we use a collision gate backward with the four inputs improperly correlated , would also spoil the digital character of the model . rather than depending on correct logic design to assure the applicability of the digital interpretation",
    ", we can imagine that our balls have an interaction potential that causes them to pass through each other without interacting in all cases that would cause problems .",
    "this is a bit strange , but it does conserve energy and momentum and is reversible . up to four balls , one traveling in each direction , can then occupy the same grid cell as they pass through each other .",
    "we can also associate the mirror information with the grid cells , thus completing the bbm as a ca model .",

    "although the bbm interaction can be softened  with the grid correspondingly adjusted  this model depends fundamentally upon information interacting at a finite distance .",
    "a very simple ca model based on the bbm , the bbmca@xcite avoids this non - locality by modeling the front and back edges of each ball , and using a sequence of interactions between edge - particles to simulate a billiard ball collision .",
    "this results in a reversible ca with just a 4-bit neighborhood ( including all mirror information ! ) , but this model gives up exact momentum conservation , even in simulating the collision of two billiard balls .",
    "in addition to making the bbmca less physical , this loss of conservation makes bbmca logic circuits harder to synchronize than the original bbm . in the bbm ,",
    "if we start a column of signals out , all moving up - right or down - right , then they all have the same horizontal component of momentum .",
    "if all the mirrors they encounter are horizontal mirrors , this component remains invariant as we pass the signals through any desired sequence of collision `` gates . ''",
    "we do nt have to worry about synchronizing signals ",
    "they all remain in a single column moving uniformly to the right . in the bbmca ,",
    "in contrast , simulated balls are delayed whenever they collide with anything . in a bbmca circuit with only horizontal mirrors ( or even without any mirrors ) , the horizontal component of momentum is not conserved , the center of mass does not move with constant horizontal velocity , and appropriate delays must be inserted in order to bring together signals that have gotten out of step .",
    "the bbmca has energy conservation , but not momentum conservation .",
    "it turns out that it is easy to make a model which is very similar to the bbm , which has the same kind of momentum conservation as the bbm , and which corresponds isomorphically to a simple ca rule .",
    "suppose we set things up exactly as we did for the bbm , with balls on a grid , moving so that they stay on the grid , but we change the collision , making the balls very compressible . in figure  [ fig.ebm]a",
    ", we illustrate the elastic collision of two balls in the resulting soft sphere model ( ssm ) .",
    "if the springiness of the balls is just right ( i.e. , we choose an appropriate interaction potential ) , then the balls find themselves back on the grid after the collision . if only one or the other ball comes in , they go straight through .",
    "notice that the output paths are labeled exactly as in the bbm model , except that the paths are deflected inwards rather than outwards ( cf .",
    "appendix to @xcite ) .",
    "if we add bbm - style hard - collisions with mirrors , turns that we use in our ssm circuits can also be achieved by soft mirrors placed at slightly different locations . ]",
    "then this model can compute in the same manner as the bbm , with the same kind of momentum conservation aiding synchronization .    in figure  [ fig.ebm]b ,",
    "we have drawn an arrow in each grid cell corresponding to the velocity of the center of a ball at an integer time .",
    "the pair of colliding balls is taken to be a single particle , and we also draw an arrow at its center .",
    "we ve colored the arrows alternately gray and black , corresponding to successive positions of an incoming pair of logic values .",
    "we can now interpret the arrows as describing the dynamics of a simple lattice gas , with the sites of the lattice taken to be the corners of the cells of the grid .    in a lattice gas , we alternately move particles and let them interact .",
    "in this example , at each lattice site we have room for up to eight particles ( 1 s ) : we can have one particle moving up - right , one down - right , one up - left , one down - left , one right , one left , one up and one down . in the movement step , all up - right particles are simultaneously moved one site up and one site to the right , while all down - right particles are moved down and to the right , etc . after all particles have been moved , we let the particles that have landed at each lattice site interact  the interaction at each lattice site is independent of all other lattice sites .    in the lattice gas",
    "pictured in figure  [ fig.ebm]b , we see on the left particles coming in on paths and that are entering two lattice sites ( black arrows ) and the resulting data that leaves those sites ( gray arrows ) .",
    "our inferred rule is that single diagonal particles that enter a lattice site come out in the same direction they came in . at the next step ,",
    "these gray arrows represent two particles entering a single lattice site .",
    "our inferred rule is that when two diagonal particles collide at right angles , they turn into a single particle moving in the direction of the net momentum . now a horizontal black particle enters the next lattice site , and our rule is that it turns back into two diagonal particles . if only one particle had come in , along either or , it would have followed our `` single diagonal particles go straight '' rule , and so single particles would follow the dotted path in the figure",

    "the bbm can not be turned into a lattice gas in this manner , because the bbm depends upon the finite extent of the interaction in space , rather than in time .",
    "notice that in establishing an isomorphism between the integer - time dynamics of this ssm and a simple lattice gas , we have added the constraint to the ssm that we can not place mirrors at half - integer coordinates , as we did in order to route signals around in the bbm model in figure  [ fig.bbm ] .",
    "this means , in particular , that we ca nt delay a signal by one time unit  as the arrangement of mirrors in figure  [ fig.ebm]c would if the spacing between all mirrors were halved .",
    "this does nt impair the universality of the model , however , since we can easily guarantee that all signal paths have an even length .",

    "[ fig.3d]a , we see a mass and momentum conserving ssm collision using the face - diagonals of the cubes that make up our 3d grid .",
    "the resulting particle ( gray ) carries one bit of information about which of two possible planes the face - diagonals that created it resided in . in a corresponding diagram showing colliding spheres ( a 3d version of figure  [ fig.ebm]a ) , we would see that this information is carried by the plane along which the spheres are compressed .",
    "this model is universal within a single plane of the 3d space , since it is just the 2d square - lattice ssm discussed above . to allow signals to get out of a single plane ,",
    "mirrors can be applied to diagonal particles to deflect them onto cube - face diagonals outside of their original plane .",
    "a slightly simpler 3d scheme is shown in figure  [ fig.3d]b . here",
    "we only use body and face diagonals , and body diagonals only collide when they are coplanar with a face diagonal .",
    "since each face diagonal can only come from one pair of body diagonals , no collision - plane information is carried by face - diagonal particles . for mirrors",
    ", we can restrict ourselves to reflecting each body diagonal into one of the three directions that it could have been deflected into by a collision with another body diagonal .",
    "this is an interesting restriction , because it means that we can potentially make a momentum - conserving version of this model without mirrors , using only signals to deflect signals .",
    "finally , the scheme shown in figure  [ fig.3d]c uses only face diagonals , with the heavier particle traveling half as fast as the particles that collide to produce it . as in figure  [ fig.3d]a , the slower particle carries a bit of collision - plane information . to accommodate the slower particles",
    ", the lattice needs to be twice as fine as in figures [ fig.3d]a and [ fig.3d]b , but we ve only shown one intermediate lattice site for clarity . noting that three coplanar face - diagonals of a cube form an equilateral triangle , we see that this model , for particles restricted to a single plane , is exactly equivalent to the triangular - lattice model pictured in figure  [ fig.eba-rule]b . as in the model pictured in figure  [ fig.3d]b , the deflection directions that can be obtained from particle - particle collisions are sufficient for 3d routing , and",
    "so this model is also a candidate for mirrorless momentum - conserving computation in three dimensions .",
    "a rather unphysical property of the bbm , as well as of the related soft sphere models we have constructed , is the use of immovable mirrors .",

    "this paper did not , however , address the issue of whether such lga s can be spatially efficient models of computation , reusing spatial resources as ordinary computers do .",
    "there is also a new question about the generation of entropy ( undesired information ) which arises in the context of reversible momentum conserving computation models , and which we will address . with mirrors ,",

    "meanwhile , the number of circuit elements ( and hence also the demand for mirror and garbage streams ) grows as the volume of the circuit@xcite .",
    "this is the familiar surface to volume ratio problem that limits heat removal in ordinary heat - generating physical systems : the rate of heat generation is proportional to the volume , but the rate of heat removal is only proportional to the surface area .",
    "we have the same kind of problem if we try to bring free energy ( i.e. , energy without information ) into a volume .",

    "we have presented examples of reversible lattice gases that support universal computation and that can be interpreted as a discrete - time sampling of the classical - mechanical dynamics of compressible balls .",
    "we would like to present here an alternative interpretation of the same models as a discrete - time sampling of relativistic classical mechanics , in which kinetic energy is converted by collisions into rest mass and then back into kinetic energy .    for a relativistic collision of some set of particles , both relativistic energy and relativistic momentum",
    "are conserved , and so : @xmath19 where the unprimed quantities are the values for each particle before the collision , and the primed quantities are after the collision .",
    "these equations are true regardless of whether the various particles involved in the collision are massive or massless .",
    "now we note that for _ any mass and momentum conserving lattice gas _ , @xmath20 and so we need only reinterpret what is normally called `` mass '' in these models as relativistic energy in order to interpret the collisions in such a lattice gas as being relativistic . if all collisions are relativistically conservative , then the overall dynamics exactly conserves relativistic energy and momentum , regardless of the frame of reference in which the system is analyzed .",
    "normal non - relativistic systems have separate conservations of mass and non - relativistic energy  a property that the collisions in most momentum - conserving lattice gases lack .",
    "thus we might argue that the relativistic interpretation is more natural in general .    in the collision of figure  [ fig.ebm]b , for example , we might call the incoming pair of particles `` photons , '' each with unit energy and unit speed .",

    "as is discussed elsewhere@xcite , macroscopic relativistic invariance could be a key ingredient in constructing ca models with more of the macroscopic richness that nature has .",
    "if a ca had macroscopic relativistic invariance , then every complex macroscopic structure ( assuming there were any ! ) could be set in motion , since the macroscopic dynamical laws would be independent of the state of motion . thus complex macroscopic structures could move around and interact and recombine .    any system with macroscopic relativistic symmetry",

    "dual - rail pairs of signals aligned in one orientation ca nt easily interact with dual - rail pairs that are aligned in a @xmath24 ( triangular lattice ) or @xmath3 ( square lattice ) rotated orientation .",

    "this may have macroscopic problems as well , however , since turning signals with the correct timing requires several correlated interactions .",
    "of course the reason we adopted dual - rail signalling to begin with was to avoid mixing logic - value information with signal momentum  every dual - rail signal has unit momentum and can be reflected without `` measuring '' the logic value .",
    "perhaps we should simply decouple these two quantities at the level of the individual particle , and use some other degree of freedom ( other than presence or absence of a particle ) to encode the logic state ( eg .",

    "single ones go straight , whereas pairs of ones are displaced inwards . both ones and zeros",
    "are deflected by the wavy `` mirror '' particles , which can play the role of the mirror - streams in our earlier constructions . deflecting a binary signal conserves momentum without recourse to dual rail logic , and without contaminating the mirror - stream .",
    "adding rest particles to this model allows signals to cross ( since the rule is , `` in all other cases particles do nt interact '' ) .",
    "models similar to this `` proto - ssm '' would be interesting to investigate on other lattices , in both 2d and 3d .",
    "the use of rest particles to allow signals to cross in this and earlier rules raises another issue connected with the macroscopic limit .",

    "thus we might want to extend the dynamics so that rest particles can both be created and destroyed .",

    "the term _ semi - classical _ has been applied to analyses in which a classical physics model can be used to reproduce properties of a physical system that are fundamentally quantum mechanical .",
    "since the finite and extensive character of entropy ( information ) in a finite physical system is such a property@xcite , all ca models can in a sense be considered semi - classical .",
    "it is interesting to ask what other aspects of quantum dynamics can be captured in classical ca models .",
    "one such aspect is the relationship in quantum systems between energy and maximum rate of state change .",
    "a quantum system takes a finite amount of time to evolve from a given state to a different state ( i.e. , a state that is quantum mechanically orthogonal ) .",
    "there is a simple relationship between the energy of a quantum system in the classical limit and the maximum rate at which the system can pass through a succession of distinct ( mutually orthogonal ) quantum states .",
    "this rate depends only on how much energy the system has .",
    "suppose that the quantum mechanical average energy @xmath25 ( which is the energy that appears in the classical equations of motion ) is measured relative to the system s ground - state energy , and in units where planck s constant @xmath26 is one .",
    "then the maximum number of distinct changes that can occur in the system per unit of time is simply @xmath27 , and this bound is always achieved by some state@xcite .",
    "now suppose we have an energy - conserving lga started in a state with total energy @xmath25 , where @xmath25 is much less than the maximum possible energy that we can fit onto the lattice .",
    "suppose also that the smallest quantity of energy that moves around in the lga dynamics is a particle with energy `` one . '' then with the given energy @xmath25 , the maximum number of spots that can possibly change on the lattice in one time - step is @xmath27 ( just as in the quantum case ) : @xmath25 smallest energy particles can each leave one spot and move to another , each causing two changes if none of them lands on a spot that was just vacated by another particle . since the minimum value of @xmath28 is 1 in this dynamics , and",
    "the minimum value of @xmath29 is 1 since this is our integer unit of time , it is consistent to think of this as a system in which the minimum value of @xmath30 is 1 ( which for a quantum system would mean @xmath31 ) .",
    "thus simple lga s such as the ssm gases reproduce the quantum limit in terms of their maximum rate of dynamical change .",

    "<S> we discuss some models of computation that are based on the elastic collisions of identical finite - diameter _ soft _ spheres : spheres which are very compressible and hence take an appreciable amount of time to bounce off each other . because of this extended impact period , these soft sphere models ( ssm s ) correspond directly to simple lattice gas automata  unlike the fast - impact bbm </S>",
    "<S> . successive time - steps of an ssm lattice gas dynamics can be viewed as integer - time snapshots of a continuous physical dynamics with a finite - range soft - potential interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we present both 2d and 3d models of universal ca s of this type , and then discuss spatially - efficient computation using momentum conserving versions of these models ( i.e. , without fixed mirrors ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the interpretation of these models as relativistic and as semi - classical systems , and extensions of these models motivated by these interpretations . </S>"
