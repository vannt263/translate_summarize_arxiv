    "the application of semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) in generating spin - based qubits@xcite is one of the focuses in the field of spintronics.@xcite there are two types of qubits investigated extensively recently.@xcite one is based on the transition between single - electron zeeman sublevels@xcite and the other is based on two - electron triplet - singlet ( ts ) states.@xcite among these works , the decoherence time of the spin states , including both the spin dephasing time@xcite and spin relaxation time,@xcite has attracted much attention as a thorough understanding of it is one of the prerequisites of the application .",
    "there are many works on spin relaxation reported , especially in single - electron qds.@xcite recently , the ts relaxation time of two - electron system has also been investigated.@xcite it was proposed that various mechanisms , such as the electron - phonon scattering together with the spin - orbit coupling,@xcite the hyperfine interaction,@xcite and the cotunneling effect , could induce ts relaxation.@xcite however , the mechanism involving electron - phonon scattering is usually treated as the key one because the nuclei - mediated relaxation@xcite and the cotunneling can be weakened via tuning external magnetic field and tunneling rates,@xcite respectively.@xcite specifically , climente _ et al . _ used exact diagonalization technique to calculate the two - electron spectrum structure and the phonon induced ts relaxation in parabolic single qds.@xcite they demonstrated the crucial role of the excited states on spectrum structure and showed a slow decrease of the relaxation time away from the ts crossing in contrast to a sharp increase in the vicinity of the crossing point , when the magnetic field is increased from zero tesla .",
    "this feature agrees qualitatively with the recent measurement.@xcite furthermore , their results indicated that the spin - down triplet state coupled with the singlet ground state through the spin - orbit coupling has a much shorter lifetime compared to the other two triplet states .",
    "this was understood by the so called `` selection rule '' based on the perturbation using the lowest two single electron levels .",
    "similar perturbative discussion was also given in ref .  .",
    "_ obtained perturbative wave functions from the selection rule and treated the spin - orbit coupling coefficient as a fitting parameter.@xcite using these functions , they fit their experiment data with electron - phonon - scattering - induced ts relaxation and obtained a particularly small spin - orbit coupling coefficient .",
    "they attributed the reduction of the coupling coefficient to the neglect of high excited states .",
    "_ pointed out that the selection rule was correct only in the vicinity of the ts crossing point,@xcite which seems to be more correct intuitively . according to the previous work by one of the authors@xcite and confirmed by destefani and ulloa,@xcite",
    "the spin - orbit coupling in quantum dots is very strong and a large number of basis functions are needed in order to achieve convergence even for the lowest few states .",
    "therefore , whether the selection rule based on the lowest few levels remains unchanged when many upper levels are involved remains questionable to us .",
    "therefore , in this work we will first reinvestigate the selection rule based on exact diagonalization method , jointly with perturbation method with many basis functions .",
    "the investigation on ts relaxation in double qd architectures is very limited .",
    "recently , wang and wu studied the single - electron spin relaxation in vertically coupled double qds and showed that the spin relaxation can be efficiently manipulated electronically by the inter - dot barrier.@xcite this suggests that the two - electron ts relaxation should also be manipulated by tuning inter - dot barrier height .",

    "when the magnetic field increases from @xmath99  t , one further observes a ts crossing between the singlet and the two triplets ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) .",

    "in fact , this selection rule is widely used in the literature.@xcite however , as one needs many basis functions to achieve convergence even in the single - electron qd system,@xcite whether the selection rule from the lowest four basis functions is robust against the inclusion of higher basis functions remains an open question . here",

    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) , but with the dot size @xmath96  nm fixed .",
    "it is seen from the figure that higher magnetic field leads to relatively larger transition rate .",

    "one finds the transition rates increase with the effective diameter @xmath121 .",
    "the reason lies on the different symmetry properties of the singlet and triplet states . for the singlet state ,",
    "the inter - electron distance decreases with the decrease of the dot size .",
    "the coulomb repulsion therefore lifts the corresponding energy levels . however , the energy lifts of the triplet states are smaller due to the antisymmetry property of the triplet states which prevents the electrons to be close to each other .",
