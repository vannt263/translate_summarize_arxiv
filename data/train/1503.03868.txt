    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : radius ] we present the statistical approach adopted to determine the optical counterparts of the roma - bzcat  sources in the sdss dr9 catalog while in section  [ sec : sample ] we describe the samples considered in our analysis . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] the results of the spectroscopic analysis are illustrated while , finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to our summary and conclusions . for our numerical results , we use cgs units unless stated otherwise .",
    "the roma - bzcat  was mainly compiled on the basis of radio , optical and x - ray surveys and the blazar coordinates reported are not uniform .",
    "the positional accuracy is generally less than @xmath21  but it could reach @xmath1 5 , corresponding to the typical uncertainty on the radio positions of the nvss , for those sources with radio flux densities close to the survey limit @xcite . since the positional uncertainties for each source are not reported in the roma - bzcat   to identify the sdss optical counterparts of the roma - bzcat  blazars we adopted the following a statistical approach .",
    "first we computed the total number of roma - bzcat  blazars that lie within the footprint of the sdss , corresponding to 1820 sources . for each blazar",
    ", we counted the total number of optical counterparts in the sdss @xmath3 present within circular regions of variable radius @xmath4 in the range between 0  and 10 . to be conservative in our analysis",
    ", we only included in the @xmath3 calculation sdss sources having the flags : class_object ( i.e. , mode ) and code_misc ( i.e. , clean ) both equal to 1 .",
    "we then created 100 mock realizations of the roma - bzcat  by shifting each blazar position in a random direction of the sky by a fixed length of 30 .",
    "the shift used to create the mock roma - bzcat  catalogs were chosen not too distant from the original roma - bzcat  location and within the sdss footprint .",
    "this guarantees to obtain fake catalogs with a sky distribution similar to the original roma - bzcatand to crossmatch each fake catalog and the sdss taking into account the local density distribution of the optical sources .",
    "the total number of blazars in each mock realization is also preserved being equal to that of the roma - bzcat  sources that lie in the sdss footprint . for each mock realization of the roma - bzcat we counted the number of associations with the sdss occurring at angular separations @xmath4 smaller than 10 .",
    "then we computed the mean number @xmath5 of these fake associations , averaged over the 100 mock roma - bzcat  catalogs , verifying that @xmath5 has a poissonian distribution . increasing the radius by @xmath60.2 , we also calculated the difference @xmath7 as : @xmath8    in figure  [ fig : delta ] we show the comparison between @xmath9 and @xmath7 . for radii larger than @xmath101.8 the @xmath7 curve",
    "superimposes that of @xmath9 indicating that roma - bzcat - sdss cross - matches could occur by chance at angular separations larger than @xmath11 .",
    "thus we choose 1.8 as to the maximum angular separation between the roma - bzcat  and the sdss position at which we consider the optical source a reliable counterpart of the blazar in the roma - bzcat .",
    "finally the chance probability of spurious associations @xmath12 was calculated as the ratio between the number of real associations @xmath13 and the average of those found in the mock realizations of the roma - bzcat  @xmath14 , corresponding to a value of @xmath11% ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "we adopted the value of @xmath11 of 1.8 to search for the optical counterparts of the blazar - like sources in our two samples within the available spectra of the sdss dr9 to confirm the source nature and whenever possible to estimate the redshift .",
    "then we analyzed two samples of sources that lie in the footprint of the sdss dr9 and with optical spectra available defined in the following .    1 .",
    "the total number of roma - bzcat  sources having a optical counterpart in the sdss dr9 spectroscopic catalog within @xmath11 is 219 . among them",
    "there are 50 blazars with an uncertain redshift estimate and additional 34 sources classified as bl lac candidates for which optical spectra were not available in literature while roma - bzcat  v4.1 was prepared .",
    "these 84 roma - bzcat  sources , with a unique correspondence in the sdss dr9 spectroscopic catalog within 1.8 , constitute our first sample investigated .",
    "2 .   the second sample lists 15 blazar - like sources with uncertain classification and/or uncertain @xmath15 estimates included in the 2fgl @xcite and in the second _ fermi_-lat agn catalog ( 2lac * ? ? ?",

    "all these 27 sources also have a unique correspondence in the sdss dr9 spectroscopic catalog within 1.8 .",
    "we visually inspected all the optical spectra available for the sources in our samples to avoid misleading classifications due to artifacts of the sdss automatic analysis , and if necessary , for example to confirm a redshift estimate , we downloaded and analyzed the raw data .",
    "we remark that for the bzb classification we adopted the criterion described in laurent - muehleisen et al .",

    "in addition , we also adopted the criterion developed by massaro et al .",
    "( 2013c ) to classify bl lac object based on the sdss ( u - r ) color , that supersedes the one based on the ca h&k break contrast originally introduced by stoke et al .",
    "thus , for each source , we computed the absorption corrected ( u - r ) color equal to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the galactic extinction in the r band , and we considered bl lac objects only those sources with @xmath18 ( see also maselli et al .",
    "we assign a bzb classification only to sources having both a `` featureless '' spectra and the @xmath19 color lower than 1.4 .      in the first sample of 84 roma - bzcat  blazars with sdss dr9 spectra",

    "in addition to these bzqs , there are 47 sources out of the 84 listed in the first sample classified as bzb according to the roma - bzcat  but with an uncertain redshift estimate . we found that 9 of them have good sdss spectra from which we obtained a @xmath15 measurement .",

    "the remaining 14 sources were classified as : normal galaxies ( 8) , type 2 seyfert galaxies ( 5 ) , according to the criteria described in winkler ( 1992 ) plus 1 source having still an uncertain nature , mostly resembling a type 2 agn .",
