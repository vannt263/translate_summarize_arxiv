    "<S> [ fig : sensitivity ] we demonstrate this sustained controllability , which supports the assumption of its coherent nature . we note that our numerical calculations of the molecular response to the localizing train of infinitely short @xmath58-kicks ( not plotted ) show more stable control , which suggests that the finite experimental pulse width may also contribute to the observed sensitivity .    , </S>",

    "<S> smaller values of @xmath62 , realized with shorter periods of the pulse train , take us closer to the classical limit ( i.e. the well known standard map @xcite ) , at which the dynamics is less sensitive to the discreteness of the qkr spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we keep the stochasticity parameter constant at @xmath63 , large enough to stay in the predominantly chaotic regime , and reduce @xmath62 while increasing the kick strength @xmath64 proportionally . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : qmvscl](*a * ) , for @xmath65 , the localized states are reached after about 10 kicks . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum break time is longer than the one in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : energy](*a * ) due to the lower kick strength ( 2 vs. 3.8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum degree of control ( @xmath66 ) is established between @xmath67 ( solid green line ) and @xmath68 ( dashed red line ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : qmvscl](*b * ) shows the result of the same experiment with @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> although the dynamics is still sensitive to @xmath0 , the unbounded growth of rotational energy results in the decreasing relative difference between the two cases and , therefore , diminishing degree of coherent control . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent energy saturation at later times is due to the finite duration of our laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the latter results in the suppressed excitation of rotational states with @xmath71 , reached in the absence of localization . </S>",
    "<S> an oxygen molecule occupying these states rotates by @xmath72  during the length of the pulse , which lowers its effective kick strength and prevents further diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations with a larger number of @xmath58-kicks , shown in the inset , better illustrate the transition between the controlled localization at @xmath65 ( bottom two lines ) and the uncontrolled classical diffusion at @xmath69 ( top two lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , the latter effective planck constant is small enough for the diffusive energy growth to persist .    in summary , we used diatomic molecules exposed to a sequence of strong laser pulses as true quantum kicked rotors , well known for their chaotic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated that despite the exponential loss of memory about the initial conditions in the classical limit , the relative phases in the initial coherent superposition of rotational states can be used to control the qkr dynamics in the absence of noise or decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> adjusting a single control parameter results in the changing rotational distribution of the final localized state : its peak is shifted from a low ( here , @xmath73 ) to a high ( @xmath74 ) angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a relative change in the rotational energy , absorbed by the laser - kicked molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent quantum nature of the control mechanism is evident from the demonstrated high sensitivity of the localized wave packet to the exact period of the pulse train , and the ability to regain control for any value of that parameter . </S>",
    "<S> driving the system closer to the classical limit , while maintaining the same degree of stochasticity , results in a gradual loss of control . studying chaotic dynamics with molecular rotors may lead to interesting unforeseen effects of centrifugal distortion , external fields or inter - molecular collisions on the controllability of quantum chaotic systems .    </S>",
