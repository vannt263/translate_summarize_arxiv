    "the color of the red giant branch of the old population indicates a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = -1.45 dex = log(x / y ) - log(x / y)@xmath3 , with the solar abundances given by @xcite , except for oxygen , for which we adopt the value from @xcite . ]",
    "representing the end of the first star formation episode .",
    "on the other hand , the metallicity of the young population is somewhat ambiguous . while measurements from a number of hii  regions @xcite yielded a low nebular oxygen abundance of [ o / h]=-0.8dex , a detailed high resolution spectroscopic study of an a - type supergiant @xcite obtained [ o / h]=-0.2dex indicating a large discrepancy between stellar and nebular chemical composition .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite in their low resolution ( 5 ) spectroscopic survey for supergiants in wlm studied three early b supergiants and found an average value of [ o / h]=-0.8dex comparable with the hii  regions .    the spectroscopic sample gathered in the survey by @xcite also contained high signal - to - noise data of several late b and a supergiants ( b5-a7 ) of luminosity class ia and ii .",
    "these objects with their rich spectra of metal lines ( mostly iron , titanium , chromium ) are ideal for a further investigation of stellar metallicity . however , at the time of the publication of this work the density of metal lines in the optical spectra together with the low spectral resolution did not allow for a determination of stellar parameters using the standard analysis techniques applied for the early - type b supergiants .",
    "recently , this situation has changed .",
    "* hereafter k08 ) in their study of the sculptor spiral galaxy ngc300 at a distance of 1.9 mpc developed a new technique to quantitatively analyze low resolution spectra of a supergiants with respect to stellar parameters and metallicity .",
    "this technique makes use of the balmer jump and the balmer lines to obtain effective temperature and gravity and determines metallicity from a @xmath4-minimization of observed and theoretical spectra in selected spectral windows .",
    "it can now be applied to the data set obtained by @xcite and allows for a more comprehensive straightforward spectroscopic study of the metallicity of the young stellar population in wlm .",
    "the distance to wlm has been determined from photometric studies of the old stellar population using the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) , the horizontal branch ( hb ) and full color - magnitude diagrams , yielding distance moduli between 24.7 and 24.95  mag ( see * ? ? ? * and references above ) .",
    "the most recent comprehensive multi - color survey for cepheids by @xcite , including j- and k - band photometry , found a distance modulus of 24.92  mag with a very small random error of 0.04  mag and a systematic error of 0.05  mag .",
    "these authors determined an average interstellar reddening e(b - v)=0.08  mag , significantly larger than the galactic foreground reddening and , thus , relevant for the derived distance . under such circumstances , an independent distance and reddening determination using",
    "the young stellar population is ideal for verifying photometrically based distances .",
    "such an independent distance determination can be provided through the quantitative spectral analysis of the b and a supergiants .",
    "@xcite and k08 have shown that a tight correlation exists between the absolute bolometric magnitude and the flux weighted gravity @xmath5 .",
    "this relationship is predicted by stellar evolution theory and allows distance determinations with a precision comparable to cepheids .    in this paper",
    ", we will carry out a spectral analysis of the low resolution optical spectra of 8 late b and a supergiants ( b5-a7 ) observed by @xcite to determine stellar temperatures , gravities , luminosities , masses and metallicities .",
    "for the analysis we will use the basic concept introduced by k08 , however , in a modified form .",
    "we will present a new numerical fit algorithm based on an empirical application of the karhunen - love expansion usually referred to as principal component analysis , which allows for an automated analysis of a large number of objects using large comprehensive grids of model atmosphere spectra .",
    "we will then combine the results with those obtained by @xcite for the early - type b supergiants and determine an independent distance using the flux - weighted gravity luminosity relationship , fglr",

    "the spectroscopic observations were obtained with the focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph 2 ( fors2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the eso very large telescope in multi - object spectroscopy mode in one night of good seeing conditions ( better than 0.7 arcsec ) on 2003 july 28 as part of the auracaria project @xcite .",
    "the total exposure time is 4500s and the air mass during the observations was smaller than 1.07 .",
    "the spectral resolution is approximately 5    and the spectral coverage extends over 2500    centered at 4500    for most of our targets .",
    "the spectra were also flux calibrated so that spectral energy distributions , in particular the balmer jump , can be used to constrain the stellar parameters .",
    "the observational data set has been described by @xcite .",
    "the paper also contains finding charts , coordinates , photometry ( v , i from the las campanas 1.3 m telescope , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radial velocities and spectral types .",
    "of the 19 confirmed supergiants found with spectral types ranging from late o to g , 8 were of spectral type b5 to a7 .",
    "the s / n per pixel for these objects is between 40 to 120 , sufficient for our quantitative analysis .",
    "this sample listed in table  [ tab_objects ] and selected for this work .",
    "the target designation follows the nomenclature in @xcite .",
    "note that we consider only stars of their a set because of the significantly better s / n .",
    "along with the broad band photometry in the aforementioned reference , we also use b- , v- , r- and i - band data published by @xcite to constrain the interstellar reddening e(b - v ) , as well as j- and k - band photometry from @xcite .",
    "the ir photometry , available only for some stars , is compiled in table  [ tab_ir ] .",
    "prior to the quantitative spectral analysis , we carefully explore the dataset available for each star , to identify spectral regions showing signs of contamination due to imperfect sky subtraction , nearby cosmic rays , and similar other observational effects .",
    "these regions are masked out and not used in the analysis .",
    "as explained in k08 the principal difficulty in the analysis of low resolution spectra of a supergiants lies in the simultaneous determination of effective temperature and metallicity .",
    "the classic method based on the use of ionization equilibria does not work , since the required lines from the neutral species ( , ,  ) are in general very weak and disappear at low resolution within noise and the blends of spectral lines . while one could use the information from the stronger lines , which define the spectral type , and a calibration of spectral type with effective temperature ,",
    "such a relationship is metallicity dependent , which requires the simultaneous and independent determination of metallicity .",
    "k08 were able to solve this problem by using the balmer jump as an independent temperature indicator in addition to the balmer lines , which can be used as a measure of gravity , and to the rich metal line spectrum , which yielded the metallicity through a @xmath8-minimization comparing selected windows of the observed spectra with very sophisticated non - lte line formation calculations .",
    "the methodology employed in the present work follows closely the ideas presented by k08 , however with some significant modifications . while k08 constructed fit diagrams of the balmer jump and the balmer lines in the @xmath9@xmath7 plane through `` by eye '' fits of the observed line profiles and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and then determined the metallicity for the effective temperature and gravity at the intersection of the two fit curves . here",
    "we have developed a completely automated numerical method , which finds the best fit of the model atmosphere synthetic spectra to the observed spectra .",
    "the advantages of this new method are obvious .",
    "it provides a more quantitative and objective way to obtain the fit and the automated procedure allows a quantitative analysis of a large number of spectra , which in the era of efficient multi - object spectrograph facilities is a very important aspect .",
    "we will describe the method in the subsections below .",
    "the basis for the quantitative spectral analysis is the same comprehensive grid of line blanketed lte model atmospheres and very detailed non - lte line formation calculations used by k08 . for a detailed description of the physics of the model atmosphere and line formation calculations see @xcite .",
    "our grid of models covers a range of @xmath10  k ( with steps of 250  k and 500  k below and above 10@xmath11  k , respectively ) and @xmath12 ( with steps of 0.05  dex ) in effective temperature and gravity with the following metallicities at each grid point , [ z ] = @xmath13 : -1.30 , -1.00 , -0.85 , -0.70 , -0.60 , -0.50 , -0.40 , -0.30 , -0.15 , 0.00 , 0.15 , 0.30 .",
    "the quantity z / z@xmath14 is the metallicity relative to the sun .",
    "the solar abundances were taken from @xcite , except for oxygen , which is from @xcite . based on trend in the literature ,",
    "a microturbulence of 8  is adopted for the low gravity models gradually changing to 4  at higher gravity .",
    "for further details we refer to k08 .",
    "this grid was primarily designed for the analysis of ia and ib luminosity class objects .",
    "several of the wlm stars selected for the present work were classified by @xcite as luminosity class ii . to consider these objects",
    ", we enlarged the grid with two new effective temperatures , 8100 and 7900k , and extended to higher gravities all the models with @xmath15  k ( @xmath16  dex ) .",
    "the goal of the analysis is to determine for each star a set of four parameters @xmath17 , logg , [ z ] and e(b - v)@xmath18 , for which the corresponding synthetic model spectrum best matches the observations .",
    "we have three data sets available : 1 ) normalized and rectified spectra , which will give line profile information for the balmer and metal lines ; 2 ) flux calibrated spectra providing information about the balmer jump , and 3 ) broad band photometry which can be used for the construction of the observed long wavelength sed .",
    "k08 have shown in detail how the theoretical spectral line profiles , the sed and the balmer jump depend on temperature , gravity and metallicity .",
    "generally speaking , the balmer lines depend mostly on gravity , but show also a significant temperature dependence , whereas the balmer jump depends mostly on temperature , but also on gravity . the dependence on metallicity of the balmer lines and",
    "the balmer jump is very weak . using these properties ,",
    "two different curves can be defined in the @xmath9@xmath7 plane , one being the locus of the models that reproduce the balmer lines when the temperature is adopted , and , conversely , another tracing the locus of the models that reproduce the balmer jump once the gravity is assumed .",
    "the intersection of these two curves yields the gravity and the temperature of the star observed .",
    "the classic method used by k08 is to construct these curves through a by - eye fit of the models to the observed data . in our new approach",
    "we have decided to use an automated numerical fit of the model spectra to the observed data .",
    "\\a ) our algorithm is iterative and begins with the fit of the balmer lines .",
    "we start with a first value of @xmath9 and [ z ] and try to find the model gravity @xmath7 which best matches the shape of the observed balmer profiles . for this purpose ,",
    "we carry out a principal component analysis ( pca ) of the normalized model spectra in spectral windows around the balmer lines . for a fixed @xmath9 and [ z ]",
    "we have n models with different gravities at each grid point ( n varies from 20 to 32 depending on the grid point ) , each of them providing a set of normalized flux values s@xmath19 ( where the index j runs over the n models ) around a selected balmer line .",
    "these model flux values define a matrix @xmath20 ( with elements a@xmath21s@xmath19 , where i labels the wavelength points and j runs over the models with different @xmath7 ) . following the concept of pca",
    ", we determine the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix @xmath22 @xcite and identify the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector as the principal component associated with the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "[ fig_proj_balmer ] shows the typical eigenvectors @xmath23 for three balmer lines . as a consistency test",
    "we check that the cumulative percentage variance associated with this principal component is always above 95% in all cases , meaning that more than 95% of the information in the input data can be described by the principal component alone .",
    "the projection of the model flux matrix @xmath20 onto the eigenvector @xmath24 allows us to define a relationship between the @xmath7 values of the models and their projections @xmath25 , for each balmer line @xmath26 which are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_proj_balmer ] . projecting the observed normalized flux values",
    "@xmath27 in each balmer line spectral window onto the corresponding eigenvector yields an observed value , which can then be compared to @xmath28 to find the best gravity @xmath7 at the selected values of @xmath9 and [ z ] .",
    "comparing the values obtained from different balmer lines ( we usually use h@xmath29 to h@xmath30 ) allows us to assign a mean value and an uncertainty @xmath31 to this determination of the best fitting gravity .",

    "using different spectral windows we can again assign an average value of [ z ] and an uncertainty @xmath31 . for this new",
    "[ z ] we iterate the determination of @xmath7 , but because of the weak dependence of the balmer lines on metallicity changes are usually small .",
    "\\c ) in the previous steps we used balmer and metal line profiles to obtain @xmath7 and [ z ] ( and their corresponding uncertainties ) at a selected value of @xmath9 .",
    "now we adopt these new values of @xmath7 and [ z ] and use the observed sed around the balmer jump to obtain a new value of @xmath9 .",
    "this is again done by pca ( but see below ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_proj_jump ] .",
    "the model atmosphere sed corresponding to this @xmath9 , @xmath7 and [ z ] is used to determine the reddening e(b - v ) from a comparison ( @xmath8-minimization ) with the observed broad band photometry , adopting the extinction law by @xcite , as well as @xmath34 .",
    "since the region used to determine @xmath9 could be affected by this extinction , we alternatively iterate the values of @xmath9 and e(b - v ) until convergence in both is reached , defining the best @xmath9 and the best e(b - v ) .",
    "unlike the cases of surface gravity and metallicity , the temperature is determined from a single feature , the balmer jump . the uncertainty in @xmath9 is thus given by our ability to effectively measure the balmer jump , and not from temperature values derived from different spectral windows .",
    "in order to estimate this uncertainty , we proceed in the following way .",
    "two values of the temperature are computed simultaneously , by using two different definitions of the balmer jump ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_proj_jump ] ) .",
    "the first one ( fig .",
    "[ fig_proj_jump]d ) corresponds to the value derived from the application of the pca base vector ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_proj_jump]c ) , while the second value ( fig .",
    "[ fig_proj_jump]b ) is based on the balmer jump index @xmath35 introduced by k08 , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 in the case of @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the number of wavelength points considered for the mean .",
    "note that in both cases , we are considering all the models in the grid for a given pair @xmath40\\right)$ ] , as previously explained . in an ideal case , with infinite s / n",
    ", both values would be exactly the same .",
    "once noise is present , there is a difference between both temperatures , that reflects how precisely the balmer jump can be measured , defining therefore the uncertainty in temperature , @xmath41 .    apart from this @xmath42 , the difference between the initially assumed temperature and the final derived value defines an error @xmath43 , which can be assigned to the set of parameters @xmath44 , e\\left(b - v\\right)\\}$ ] .",
    "this @xmath43 can be interpreted as the distance between the guess temperature and the true @xmath9 , because of the weak dependence of the balmer jump on gravity and metallicity .",
    "+ we repeat the whole procedure ( a , b , c ) for different initial values of @xmath9 and , thus , obtain a set of parameters @xmath45 , \\mathrm{e}\\left(\\mathrm{b - v}\\right)\\}_{i}$ ] together with their corresponding weights @xmath46 .",
    "the final solution @xmath47 = @xmath17 , logg , [ z ] and e(b - v)@xmath18 is then obtained as a weighted mean    @xmath48 where the indexes @xmath49 run over all the individual solutions for the corresponding parameter ( @xmath9 , logg , [ z ] or e(b - v ) ) . in a similar way , a formal error ( uncertainty ) is obtained from    @xmath50    this analysis method can only be applied in those cases for which the balmer jump region is observed . in some instances , due to the location of the star in the observed field and its spectrum on the detector , this area is not observed , and we have to rely on the normalized spectrum to obtain information about the effective temperature . in this situation as already discussed by k08 , the relative strength of lines from different species can be used .",
    "if the star is hot enough to show lines ( earlier than around a0 ) , these can be used to constrain the temperature .",
    "the accuracy is usually comparable to that when the balmer jump is used . if the star is cool enough ( later than b9 )",
    ", the relative behavior of different metal lines ( for example versus lines , or the strength of the fe - mg blend located at @xmath515150   ) could be used . to find the temperature ,",
    "we then proceed in a similar way , defining several spectral windows in which these metal or helium lines are present , to construct the pca eigenvectors ( from the normalized synthetic spectra ) , but now with respect to temperature .",
    "there is an underlying assumption , though , when using this method : the adopted metallicity pattern .",
    "the implications of our adopted solar abundance pattern are discussed in sect [ sect_micro ] .",
    "temperatures determined by this method have a somewhat larger uncertainty , related to the accuracy with which the metallicity can be determined .",
    "metallicity and microturbulence are closely related with respect to the values derived from any analysis . as discussed by k08 , it is difficult to constraint microturbulence at such low spectral resolution , since lines from a given species , with very different strengths , are required . in consequence , as explained in  [ grid ] , for each object , the microturbulence is given by the final ( @xmath9,@xmath7 ) pair",
    ". we will discuss in ",
    "[ sect_micro ] the possible effects of the adopted relationship between the microturbulence and the ( @xmath9,@xmath7 ) values .",
    "the formal accuracy of the final solution depends primarily on the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "our experience shows that , for the low spectral resolution considered in this work , a minimum s / n@xmath5250 is required for the metallicity determination in order to keep the uncertainties in a tolerable range ( see next section ) , while t@xmath53 and @xmath7 determinations , both based on stronger features ( the balmer jump and the balmer lines ) can still be carried out at much lower , s / n@xmath5215 .",
    "the formal errors arising from the application of our algorithm , as previously defined , are rather small .",
    "typically , surface gravity and metallicity can be constrained to better than 0.05  dex , while the effective temperature uncertainty results in a few k. to define more meaningful errors , we also consider the uncertainties derived for the model in the grid with parameters closest to the final solution , i.e. , we use the @xmath31 values ( defined above ) obtained for the set @xmath44\\}$ ] closest to the final solution .",
    "these provide an idea about how well the observations are reproduced by a single model .",
    "+ the final errors quoted are obtained as a quadratic combination of these two sets of uncertainties .",
    "typical values for these final errors result in @xmath5225% in temperature , @xmath520.10.2dex in surface gravity and @xmath520.20.3dex in metallicity . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig_classic_fit ] shows the solution obtained for one of the stars in the sample , a14 .",
    "the small box encloses the solution with the formal errors in the @xmath9logg plane .",
    "as can be seen this solution area agrees with the intersection of the conventional fit curves for the balmer jump and the balmer lines , with the difference of the solutions well below the resolution limit of both methods .",
    "the final adopted errors are represented by the dashed box .    with regard to the uncertainties in the flux",
    "weighted gravity , it must be noted that the errors in @xmath7 and @xmath9 are correlated ( see fig .",

    "the reader is referred to k08 for a detailed discussion on this topic .      with the final set of parameters known for each star ,",
    "it is useful to evaluate the fitness of each final solution , with the goal of identifying problems not detected in the analysis . given a pair observation  final model @xmath55 , we define the residuals of a spectral window with @xmath56 wavelength points as @xmath57^{1/2}\\ ] ] the fitness @xmath58 of a parameter @xmath47 is given by the sum of these relative residuals @xmath59 over all the spectral windows considered in the determination of the corresponding parameter ( as described above ) , weighted by the ( normalized ) s / n of each individual window @xmath60 in the case of the surface gravity and metallicity , the normalized spectra are used to calculate the fitness . for the effective temperature ,",
    "the flux calibrated data and the synthetic seds are considered to evaluate the fitness when the balmer jump is observed . if it is not observed the normalized spectra are used .",
    "alternatively , we could define the fitness for each window as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the error allowed in the fitting ( tolerance ) , defined as @xmath63 .",
    "the global fitness , for each parameter individually , is given by the sum over all the windows , in this case without weighting by the s / n since its effect is already accounted for with the tolerance .",
    "this second fitness evaluator has the advantage of containing additional information in its sign , with a positive / negative value reflecting whether the corresponding parameter is over or under - estimated .",
    "this fitness definition is particularly useful to detect variations in the goodness - of - fit from star to star .",
    "+ we define the global fitness of the model with respect to the observation , @xmath64 , as the sum of the individual fitness values of each parameter , @xmath65 . from the definitions ,",
    "it is clear that the smaller the absolute value , the fitter the model . fitness values corresponding to the final solutions are presented in table  [ tab_fitness ] , and they will be used in the following sections to discuss the results .",
    "we performed a number of simple tests to check the analysis algorithm .",
    "in all the following cases , we emulated the observed spectra by degrading the models to a resolution of 5    ( fwhm ) and re - sampling them to 1.32   ( the spectral resolution and dispersion provided by fors2 when equipped with the 600b grism ) .",
    "note that these tests are meant to check our ability to reproduce known input parameters .",
    "first , we verified that , for any given model in the grid , we were able to recover almost exactly its parameters . in a second step ,",
    "we created a number of models with parameters within the limits of the grid , but without any corresponding model in the grid .",
    "three different sets of @xmath66logg , representatives of a late b , an early a and a mid a supergiants were considered , for four different metallicities . in all cases , we were able to recover the parameters to better than 1% in effective temperature ( based on the balmer jump ) , 0.02  dex in surface gravity and 0.03  dex in metallicity .",
    "these two tests were carried out without considering noise , since they were intended to probe the ability of our algorithm to recover known parameters , without any influence from external sources .",
    "a third set of tests was performed to check the effect of noise on the determination of metallicity , and hence to evaluate the minimum s / n required for ( meaningful ) metallicity determinations .",
    "we selected a number of models in the grid representative again of the different spectral groups , degraded them to different s / n ( 100 , 50 , 30 and 15 ) and carried out a metallicity analysis .",
    "for each model and each s / n value , we did 100 independent trials .",
    "the results for the early a - type case are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_sigma_met ] ( the results are very similar for all the other @xmath9logg pairs considered ) .",
    "the first two rows correspond to @xmath67=0.00 $ ]  dex , while the other two rows are for @xmath67=-0.85 $ ]  dex .",
    "each single plot displays the relative frequency of occurrence versus the difference between the input and recovered metallicities , presenting also the sigma of the distribution .",
    "since this sigma only describes the dispersion introduced by the noise , the global uncertainty obtained in a generic analysis would be larger , once the effects of the uncertainties in the other parameters ( temperature and gravity ) are accounted for . as a general recipe , a maximum @xmath68 dex at a fixed pair of @xmath9 and @xmath69 would be required in order to have a final global uncertainty @xmath70 dex .",
    "clearly , the minimum s / n depends on the metallicity : the higher the @xmath67 $ ] , the stronger the lines , hence the lower the s / n required to detect them . at the same time , it also depends to some extent on the spectral type ; for a given metallicity , cool mid a - types ( a1 to a3 ) present stronger metal features ( as well as a higher line density ) than late b-/early a - types ( b5 to a0 ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig_sigma_met ] , it is possible to identify a minimum s / n@xmath5250 , in particular at low metallicities , to meet the requirement of a global metallicity uncertainty around 0.2dex .      in order to keep the task of creating such a huge model grid manageable , only three parameters ( the most important ones , @xmath9 , @xmath69 and [ z ] ) are explored so far . in the following we want to discuss some of the possible implications regarding how the models are calculated .",
    "as previously stated , metallicity and microturbulence are coupled in any analysis . aimed at exploring the effect that our assumption about microturbulence @xmath71 ( given for a pair @xmath9-logg ) could have on the results , we calculated a small set of models with different values of @xmath71 ( but the same @xmath9 , @xmath69 , [ z ] considered for the grid ) , and analyzed them in the same manner as the observations .",
    "for a variation of @xmath71 of @xmath722  ( which is the typical dispersion obtained in high resolution analyses of these type of objects , for a given luminosity class ) we found an error of less than 1% , 0.01 dex and 0.07 dex for effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity , respectively .",
    "as expected , both @xmath9 and logg are unaffected by a change in microturbulence , and the larger effect is produced in the metallicity .",
    "here we want to stress again that we are not dealing with individual lines , which certainly could present large variations with @xmath71 ( like for example 4481   ) , but with all the spectral lines at once ( or with as many of them as possible ) ; the use of the whole spectrum weights the effect of the turbulence differently , reducing its impact on the derived global metallicity .",
    "this is , on the other hand , a warning sign for the use of small sections of the spectrum ( at low resolution ) to determine individual elemental abundances , which would be seriously hampered by the unknown @xmath71 .",
    "we proceeded in a similar way in order to evaluate the impact of our assumption of a solar abundance pattern .",
    "we calculated a set of models for which the ratio of the @xmath73-elements to fe - group elements relative to the solar reference vary , with [ @xmath73/fe ] = @xmath740.15 , @xmath740.30 dex ( note that by definition , the value used in the grid is [ @xmath73/fe ] = 0.0 dex ) .",
    "the maximum change in effective temperature ( based on the balmer jump ) and surface gravity due to these changes in relative abundances is less than 1% and 0.01dex  respectively .",
    "the difference goes up to 6% in temperature when using the normalized spectrum instead of the balmer jump .",

    "the distances derived by both methods are in excellent agreement .",

    "as can be seen in this figure , the agreement is very good .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the solution used for a6 ( cool or hot model ) has little effect on the derived distance , since the values of the flux weighted gravity are very similar in both cases , and in any case , a change in the flux weighted gravity is correspondingly accompanied by changes in the bolometric correction and extinction ( relatively minor in this case ) , in such a way that the star moves along the relationship .",

    "however , towards lower gravities and higher luminosities the stellar evolution fglrs show a strong curvature and start to differ from the result of the spectral analysis . the effect is stronger for smc metallicity ( [ z]=-0.7 ) , which is close to the average metallicity we have determined for the young stellar population in wlm .",
    "an indication of a similar discrepancy has already been noted by k08 ( see their fig .",
    "27 and the corresponding discussion ) .",
    "this discrepancy seems to be equivalent to a discrepancy between stellar evolutionary and spectroscopic mass at high luminosities ( see fig .  [ fig_masses ] ) .",
    "note that ( see k08 , eq.(29 ) ) @xmath116 and , in consequence , smaller spectroscopic masses result in a fglr  shifted towards smaller flux weighted gravities .",
    "thus , one reason for the discrepancy could be a systematic underestimate of stellar gravities by the spectral analysis at the high luminosity end of the fglr .",
    "we realize that the most discrepant objects in fig .",
    "[ fig_masses ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_teofglr ] are early b - type supergiants , which where analyzed with a different stellar atmosphere code . on the other hand , k08 had a much larger sample of supergiants available and did not find a systematic difference between high luminosity early b - types and ba - types",
    ".    another possibility might be the effects of rotation on the evolutionary tracks .",
    "k08 noticed that tracks without rotation result in fglrs shifted towards higher gravities because the mass - to - light ratio is larger .",
    "thus , tracks with even higher initial rotation than considered here may result in fglrs in better agreement with the observations .",
    "however , such increase in rotational velocity will not be supported by recent studies of lmc and smc main sequence b stars , progenitors of ba supergiants , showing projected rotational velocities below 200  ( see for example * ? ? ?",

    "except for the very high luminosity end , the relative difference between the evolutionary fglrs for [ z]=0.0 and [ z]=-0.7 is very small .",
    "this difference is mostly caused by the effects of mass - loss , which are stronger at higher metallicity and higher luminosity .",
    "the fact that we obtain a distance consistent with the trgb and cepheid studies of wlm using the fglr  calibration by k08 , which is based on objects mostly with lmc metallicity , supports the conclusion that metallicity effects are not important .",

    "we find good agreement at low luminosities independent of metallicity assumptions for the theoretical relationship , but disagreement at higher luminosities with the theoretical fglr , which are more important for the low metallicity .",
