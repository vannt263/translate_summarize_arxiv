    "the evolution and final fates of stars depend on their initial masses @xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , which is still subject to some uncertainties involved in stellar mass - loss , mixing processes and nuclear transition rates . stars with @xmath4 0.58m@xmath2 form a c - o core",

    "810m@xmath6 stars can end up in various ways , that is , as o - ne - mg white dwarfs without explosions , or as electron - capture supernovae or fe core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary changes in the central density and temperature of the o - ne - mg core are determined by the competition among the contraction , cooling and heating processes .",
    "if heating is fast enough relative to contraction , the temperature would become high enough to ignite ne - o burning , which would result in the fe core formation .",
    "if cooling is fast , the contraction would lead to the collapse of the o - ne - mg core and an electron - capture supernova .",
    "the fate of the stars with @xmath7 8 - 10 m@xmath2 is thus determined by these competitions .",
    "since these competing processes are induced by electron capture and @xmath0-decay , the accurate weak rates are crucially important .",

    "the cooling and heating rates of the core as well as the core - contraction rate are determined by the weak rates for the nuclear pairs .",
    "the fate of the stars depend sensitively on the nuclear electron capture and @xmath0-decay rates .",
    "precise evaluations of the weak rates in stars are quite important for the evolutions of not only the stars having o - ne - mg cores but also lower mass stars having c - o cores ( which contain primordial species of a = 20 - 27 ) .",
    "the rates are also important for the final fates of o - ne - mg , c - o and hybrid c - o - ne white dwarfs in binary systems .",

    "transitions are forbidden or transitions from excited states give essential contributions , the method becomes invalid when it is applied to the interpolation with sparce grid of densities at log@xmath9 = 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 .",
