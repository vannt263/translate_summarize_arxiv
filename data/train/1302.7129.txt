    "the well - known effect of stellar parallax can be explained in two ways .",
    "the first and most common one is in the heliocentric system , in which the sun and the observed stars are approximately considered to be at rest . while the earth moves around the sun , its position relative to the stars changes , and that results with the effect of motion of the near stars @xcite .",
    "the parallax is observed using the more distant stars in the background .    second way to explain stellar",
    "parallax is by saying that the apparent movement of the stars is in fact the real motion in the pseudo - potential that is , according to mach s principle @xcite , generated by the very fact of the simultaneous accelerated motion of all the bodies in the universe , including the distant stars .",
    "the comparison between two approaches is given in the figure [ fig1 ] , with the appropriate choice of coordinate axes that will be used in the calculation which follows .",

    "now in order to demonstrate how one can arrive to the correct prediction of the stellar parallax in the neo - tychonian system , we will calculate the trajectory of the star proxima centauri in the pseudo - potential given by eq ( 4.4 ) in @xcite , @xmath1 here @xmath2 stands for newton s constant , @xmath3 stands for the mass of the sun and @xmath4 describes the motion of the sun in the earth s pseudo - potential and was calculated in @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian that describes the motion of the proxima centauri in the earth s pseudo - potential is therefore given by ( gravitational interaction between the star and the sun is , of course , neglected ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass of the star , and @xmath7 describes its motion .",
    "the equations of motions are mass - independent , as expected .",

    "the numerical solutions over the period of 1 year are presented in the fig [ fig2 ] .",

    "using the numerical results obtained above , one can evaluate the expression ( [ parallax ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath12 which is perfectly consistent with the astronomical data @xcite .",
    "we have analysed the motion of the star proxima centauri in the earth s pseudo - potential previously derived from mach s principle @xcite .",

    "<S> the recent paper published in european journal of physics @xcite aimed to demonstrate the kinematical and dynamical equivalence of heliocentric and geocentric systems . </S>",
    "<S> the work is performed in the neo - tychonian system , with key assumption that orbits of distant masses around the earth are synchronized with the sun s orbit . </S>",
    "<S> motion of sun and mars have been analysed , and the conclusion was reached that the very fact of the accelerated motion of the universe as a whole produces the so - called `` pseudo - potential '' that not only explains the origin of the pseudo - forces , but also the very motion of the celestial bodies as seen from the static earth . </S>",
    "<S> after the paper was published , the question was raised if that same potential can explain the motion of the distant stars that are not affected by the sun s gravity ( unlike mars ) , and if it can be used to reproduce the observation of the stellar parallax . </S>",
    "<S> the answer is found to be positive . </S>"
