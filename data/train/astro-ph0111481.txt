    "the mass of the molecular ism is dominated by the largest clouds which tend to form stars in groups , rather than in isolation @xcite .",
    "star formation is inefficient , however , and as the binding mass of a molecular cloud is lost through the action of stellar winds , radiation , and outflows , most groups evaporate @xcite and become isolated stellar systems .",
    "thus an increased understanding of clustered star formation is essential for learning about the origin of most galactic disk stars , perhaps including the sun .    in this paper",
    ", we present millimeter wavelength observations of two star formation sites , irs1 and irs2 , in the ngc2264 region of northern monoceros .",
    "lying at a distance of 760  pc @xcite , this region is associated with a moderate mass cloud , @xmath4 @xcite , that contains 30 iras sources , most classified as class i protostars @xcite , and @xmath5 near - infrared sources @xcite .",
    "irs1 , also known as allen s source @xcite , is an early b star situated just north of the cone nebula .",
    "@xcite postulate that it has triggered the formation of several low mass stars around it and @xcite map a number of nearby massive dust condensations suggesting that high mass star formation may also be occuring .",
    "molecular spectral lines show signatures of both outflow @xcite and infall @xcite .",
    "irs2 , discovered by @xcite , is a less luminous and less well studied source @xmath6 to the north of irs1 .",
    "a small cluster and nebulosity is visible in the i band image of @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a co outflow toward this source , @xcite mapped an associated dense molecular clump ( which they called monob1-d ) , and @xcite found preliminary evidence for collapse .    here , we combine continuum observations of the dusty envelopes around the most embedded protostars with spectral line observations of the gas in these two cluster forming regions .",
    "the molecular envelopes around the two clusters have a similar mass but are morphologically distinct and present an interesting comparative study . in both cases ,",
    "the self - absorbed  line is used to diagnose relative motions and show large scale collapse onto each stellar group that appears to be disrupted by protostellar outflows on smaller scales . in the bright , compact irs1 clump",
    ", the optically thin 13cop  line is used to map the molecular abundance , velocity centroid , and dispersion and thereby constrain the modeling of the  profiles . in irs2 , where individual protostars are resolved ,",
    "the size and velocity dispersion is used to estimate an upper limit for their formation time and to determine the gravitational stability of the group .",
    "the observations are described in  [ sec : obs ] , and their analysis in  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the observations were carried out at the heinrich hertz telescope on mt .",

    "we used the facility 19 channel bolometer to observe continuum emission at @xmath7 m and the 230  ghz receiver to observe the @xmath0 lines of  and 13cop .",
    "the weather was good during the run and the zenith opacity at @xmath7 m ranged from 0.3 to 0.55 ; for the spectral line observations system temperatures ranged from 350 to 450  k.    the bolometer observations were carried out in dual - beam raster mode with an azimuth scanning velocity of @xmath8/sec and a wobbler frequency of 2  hz .",
    "individual maps had sizes @xmath9 , sampled at @xmath10 in azimuth and elevation , and took 40  minutes to complete .",
    "skydips were made before and after each map to determine the sky opacity and observations of jupiter and uranus were used to calibrate the data .",
    "two maps were made of each source at different hour angles and therefore different scan directions across the source .",
    "the data were reduced and co - added using the nic software package resulting in an rms noise in the final maps of 0.14  jy per @xmath11 beam .",
    "the spectral line data were also taken in on - the - fly mode .",
    "maps were made by scanning alternately in right ascension and declination at @xmath12/sec with the reference @xmath13 west of the map center .",
    "individual map sizes were @xmath14 , sampled at @xmath10 , and took @xmath15  minutes each .",
    "system temperatures varied from 350  k to 425  k. maps were repeated several times and made at different offsets , then co - added and stitched together in the class software package so as to achieve an rms noise temperature of 0.8  k ( ) and 0.4  k ( 13cop ) per 250  khz ( @xmath16  ) channel .",
    "the temperature scale was calibrated through the chopper wheel method @xcite , and we then applied main beam and forward efficiencies @xmath17 .",
    "observations of the standard source orion irc2 were made daily as an overall check of calibration , pointing , and setup .",
    "for both the bolometer and line observations , pointing was checked through observations of jupiter every 23 hours .",
    "the @xmath7 m continuum emission toward irs1 and irs2 is shown in figure  [ fig : bolo ] .",
    "irs1 is the bright , compact source to the south .",
    "its elongated shape shows signs of substructure ; @xcite resolve five distinct condensations with higher resolution iram and jcmt observations .",
    "irs2 lies to the north and is more fragmented with several low intensity peaks , suggestive of a slightly more evolved cluster in which the individual protostars are beginning to shed their circumstellar envelopes and migrate away from their birthplace .",
    "the integrated fluxes , for flux densities greater than 0.5  jy  beam , of the two clusters are similar , 94  jy for irs1 ( consistent with ward - thompson et al . ) and 84  jy for irs2 indicating that they have similar dust masses and make a good comparative study .",
    "the fluxes convert to masses through @xmath18 where we have taken the mass opacity @xmath19  @xmath20  g , dust temperature @xmath21  k , as in @xcite and distance @xmath22  pc .",
    "thus the total interstellar mass around irs1 is @xmath23 and @xmath24 around irs2 . from the projected area of each group , 0.45  pc@xmath25 for irs1 and 0.62  pc@xmath25 for irs2",
    ", we estimate average column and volume densities @xmath26  cm , @xmath27  for irs1 and @xmath28  cm , @xmath29  for irs2 .",
    "-1.0 in    -1.1 in      the average density of the material traced by the continuum observations is similar to that of  emitting gas .",
    "indeed , the morphology of the integrated line emission follows the dust ( see figure  [ fig : irs1_h13cop ] ) and we therefore use the line data to investigate the dynamics of the circumcluster material .",
    "the optically thick  spectra provide information on relative motions , i.e. infall and outflow , in the gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the optically thin 13cop  show the intensity weighted mean velocity and linewidth along each line of sight .",
    "we also use the latter to measure the molecular abundance in the irs1 clump .",
    "the individual protostars in the compact irs1 clump merge together in the @xmath30 beam of the line observations and we examine average , group properties .",
    "objects in the more extended irs2 clump are resolved , however , and we can determine mass infall rates onto both the cluster and a single protostar .",
    "in addition , by comparing the cluster s size and velocity dispersion , we estimate its age .      line and continuum data in irs1 are compared in figure  [ fig : irs1_h13cop ] .",
    "the left panel overlays contours of integrated 13copintensity over a grayscale of the dust emission .",
    "their similar appearance demonstrates that we can use the line data to examine motions of the circumcluster material .",
    "the right panel plots the two quantities on a point by point basis and shows an approximately linear trend over a decade in scale with the implication that the 13cop  is both optically thin and its abundance constant across the clump . by converting each quantity to a column density ( assuming an excitation temperature of 20  k for the gas and dust temperature of 17  k ) the best fit 13cop  abundance relative to h@xmath31",
    "is found to be @xmath32 .",
    "for an isotopic ratio , @xmath33 , the implied  abundance lies in the range , @xmath34 , similar to values in other ob star forming regions @xcite .",
    "the lack of variation across the clump is demonstrated by the two dashed lines bracketing the data at @xmath35\\times 10^{-11}$ ] .",
    "-0.9 in    -1.8 in    higher moments of the 13cop  emission show the variation of mean velocity and dispersion across the cluster ( figure  [ fig : irs1_velocity ] ) the former increases from 7.0  toward the east to 8.4  at center , but then returns to a lower value , @xmath36  in the west .",
    "there is no clearly defined rotation across the clump and toward the central region , @xmath37 to @xmath38 , the velocity difference , @xmath39 , is much less than the dispersion .",
    "the dispersion map itself also shows little variation in this central region and has an average value , @xmath40  .",
    "-1.5 in    -1.25 in    the  spectra are self - absorbed across the clump : they generally show two peaks and a central dip at the mean velocity of 13cop .",
    "changes in the velocity of the absorbing gas relative to the emitting gas alter the observed profile and are a diagnostic of relative motions in the clump @xcite .",
    "the relatively poor resolution of the line data , @xmath41  pc , does not permit a detailed analysis of the dynamics around individual protostars within this cluster and we therefore focus on global properties , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : irs1_avespec ] . here , average spectra are shown , computed over different regions of the clump corresponding to different @xmath7 m flux densities .",
    "this is similar to radial averaging but takes into account the non - circular shape of the clump . at low flux densities , corresponding to the outer regions ,",
    "the average spectra are relatively weak and the optical depths are low",
    ". nevertheless , the  spectra are clearly asymmetric and show the red - shifted self - absorption characteristic of inward motions @xcite . at higher flux densities , toward the clump center , the line intensities and optical depths increase and the profiles show two peaks with a central dip . however , the spectra become more symmetric with increasing flux density until at the highest values at the clump s center , the two peaks are of similar intensity suggesting zero average inflow in this region .",
    "-1.0 in    -0.4 in    infall spectra are notoriously difficult to interpret @xcite , and the change in profile shapes observed in irs1 require detailed modeling to understand the flows of material in this complex region . since the clump has a single , central peak and no clear velocity gradient , we use the 1-d radiative transfer code , ratran , of @xcite to model , simultaneously , the dust and line data .",
    "the continuum and 13cop  observations fix the size , temperature , density profile , 13cop  abundance , mean velocity , and velocity dispersion and tightly constrain the model , leaving only the velocity profile and isotopic ratio as the remaining parameters in the model output  line profiles .",
    "the model consists of 10 logarithmically spaced , radially symmetric , shells from @xmath42  cm to @xmath43  cm ( 0.32  pc ) .",
    "@xcite show that the spectral energy distribution of irs1 is well fit by the sum of two greybodies consisting of a compact component at 38  k and a larger , cooler component at 17  k that dominates the mass .",
    "based on this , we set the temperature of the outer layer at 17  k and the inner layers , @xmath44  cm at 38  k. the gas temperature is fixed to be the same as the dust as would be expected at the high densities in the model .",
    "figure  [ fig : irs1_h13cop ] shows that the clump is moderately , but not strongly , peaked and we find that the density profile @xmath45  , when convolved with a @xmath30 beam , matches the dust and velocity integrated 13cop  maps well .",
    "the abundance , @xmath32 , systemic velocity , @xmath46  , and velocity dispersion , @xmath47  , are set constant in all layers as indicated by the 13cop  data .",
    "the high relative motions between the layers contribute to broaden the output 13cop  spectra close to the observed 1.0  . with these parameters",
    ", we find that we can reproduce the ( radially averaged ) continuum fluxes and 13cop  spectra to within 20% .    under these constraints ,",
    "it is not possible to fit the observed  spectra as closely since only the isotopic abundance and relative velocities between the layers can be varied . through experimentation with the models ,",
    "it was found that , given the observed density , temperature , abundance , and velocity profiles , the increasing symmetry of the  spectra toward the cluster center can only be explained by an outer layer collapsing onto an _ expanding _ inner region .",
    "figure  [ fig : irs1_avespec ] plots radially averaged model  and 13cop  spectra as dotted lines in comparison with the observed data for the case where the isotopic ratio , @xmath48 ( implying @xmath49 ) , and the outer layer ( @xmath50 to @xmath51  cm ) collapses at a speed @xmath1  onto the inner layers ( @xmath42  cm to @xmath52  cm ) expanding at a speed @xmath53  .    the combination of large scale collapse and central expansion conspire to match the observed spectral variations from core edge to center because the optical depth is very high in the low density , outer layers and produces a broad ( blue and redshifted ) , self - absorption dip along lines of sight toward the center but only redshifted self - absorption along lines of sight near the edges that do not intercept the inner expanding layer .",
    "the velocity of the absorption dip is not observed to change from core center to edge and is reproduced in the model via the increased projection of the radial flow along lines of sight toward the edges .",
    "the model spectra have broader self - absorption dips than the data because of the small number of layers in the model and the abrupt change in temperature from 17  k in the outer layer to 38  k in inner layers .",
    "applying a smoother temperature transition and more layers produces more rounded self - absorption dips but at the expense of adding additional parameters to the model .    because of",
    "the radial dependence , @xmath54 , most of the mass of the core is in the outer layers and altering the velocities of the innermost layers , @xmath55  cm , does not change the output profiles noticeably .",
    "that is , the model resembles the two layer model described by @xcite but with a spherical geometry . with that caveat ,",
    "the output  profiles are very sensitive to the optical depth and infall speed of the outer layer and expansion speed of the layer interior to that ( which together account for about three quarters of the total mass ) and through experimentation with the models we found that the column density and velocities of these layers are constrained to within @xmath56 by the requirement of matching the observed redshifted absorption at large clump radii and near - symmetry at small radii .",
    "the outer , infalling , layer contains 1/2 the total mass , or about @xmath57 , and the mass infall rate onto the cluster is therefore @xmath58 this is one to two orders of magnitude greater than infall rates onto solar and intermediate mass protostars @xcite as expected for a global infall onto a group of such objects and is similar to the value expected for a gravitational flow , @xmath59 , where @xmath40  is the average velocity dispersion of the core ( figure  [ fig : irs1_velocity ] ) , and @xmath60 is the gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "the model requires an expanding shell to fit the increasing symmetry toward the core center .",
    "physically , this is probably due to the protostellar outflows in the region , one of which appears to be directed along our line of sight @xcite .",
    "@xcite hypothesize that ( low mass ) stars self - determine their final mass through the removal of a collapsing envelope by their outflows ( see also @xcite ) . by comparing clusters in different evolutionary states and examining the gas flows around them",
    ", it will be possible to see if such a process is relevant in a clustered environment where most stars form , and therefore assess its role in the origin of the stellar imf @xcite .",
    "continuum and line emission were lower in irs2 than in irs1 .",
    "the proportion between them , however , was approximately the same and the 13cop  abundance was found to be consistent with that measured in irs1 , though with a greater uncertainty due to the lower signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "due to the relative weakness of the emission , only the central part of the cluster was mapped in  and 13cop .",
    "figure  [ fig : irs2_avespec ] plots the boundary of the line data on a map of continuum emission .",
    "slight red - shifted self - absorption is found in the average  spectrum shown in the left panel .",
    "the self - absorption dip is small due to the low optical depth when averaged over the entire mapped region , but is more pronounced in individual spectra , particularly around the dust peaks where the column density is greatest .",
    "both red- and blue - shifted asymmetries are found ( see below ) but the dominant tendency is for red - shifted asymmetry suggesting , as in irs1 , large scale collapse onto the cluster .",
    "given the complex resolved structure in irs2 , similar fits to the spectra at different size - scales as in  [ sec : irs1 ] , are not feasible with a 1-d model .",
    "however , both simple plane - parallel and spherical two layer model fits to the average spectrum imply an infall speed @xmath61  .",
    "this is similar to the speed of the collapsing layer around irs1 and implies a similar mass infall rate , @xmath62 .",
    "-0.9 in    -0.9 in    the greater separation of the protostars in irs2 allows an investigation of the flows around each one individually .",
    "seven cores , labeled a - g in figure  [ fig : irs2_avespec ] are apparent as peaks in the dust emission and interpolated spectra ( at a resolution of @xmath30 ) toward the six that lie within the boundary of the line data are shown in figure  [ fig : irs2_cores ] . a complex mixture of dynamical states are found .",
    "core c has the classic infall profile and core d shows a strong reversed signature .",
    "cores e and f show possible signs of infall and reversed flow respectively but the optical depth is too low to be sure .",
    "the  spectra toward cores a and b are not readily interpreted in the same manner , due to multiple peaks possibly from absorption by overlapping outflows .",
    "gaussian fits to the 13cop  spectra show that the non - thermal velocity dispersion is typically in the range 0.7 to 1.0  but has a pronounced local minimum of 0.4  around core b. the resolution of these data is too low to test collapse models in detail but we do not find a correlation between the  asymmetry and the 13cop  dispersion , analogous to that seen in the serpens cluster @xcite and as might be expected from motions driven by the dissipation of turbulence .",
    "to estimate the dynamical influence of each protostar , we have examined average spectra around each one with different smoothing lengths .",
    "although there is confusion from merging at angular scales @xmath63 , we find that the overall infall dynamics of the cluster eventually dominate and that the influence of any single protostar does not exceed a radius @xmath64  pc .",
    "core c shows the clearest infall signature with a deep , red - shifted , absorption dip .",
    "the infall spectra extend for @xmath65 away from the core before merging with the reversed profiles of spectra associated with core d. the core also has the largest envelope with a total continuum flux of 12.3  jy and integrated 13cop  intensity of 2.7  k  within a radius @xmath66  pc , implying a mass @xmath67 .",
    "the high column density through this envelope is responsible for the deep self - absorption dip , and does not imply a particularly high infall speed .",
    "a model fit using the spherically symmetric ratran code implies an infall speed @xmath1  , and mass infall rate @xmath68 .",
    "the speed is the same as the collapse around the entire cluster but the mass infall rate is considerably less because the fit requires only an outer @xmath69 layer to be collapsing . dividing the overall mass infall rate onto the cluster by the number of protostars within it",
    "gives an average mass infall rate per protostar about 3 times higher than measured around core c , the one with the clearest individual collapse signature : clearly not all the material falling onto the cluster makes it all the way to the scale of protostars .",
    "the one other core , d , with a deep self - absorption dip shows the opposite asymmetry , indicative of an expanding , rather than infalling , outer layer .",
    "it also has the largest 13cop  linewidth , 1.0  , in the region . using a similar model as for core c",
    ", the expansion speed is estimated to be 0.5  .",
    "this is likely due to an embedded star although there is no iras or msx point source at its center : higher sensitivity mid - infrared observations are required to determine the stellar content of each core .",
    "-0.8 in    -0.4 in    because the envelopes around individual protostars in the cluster are resolved , the optically thin 13cop  spectra give a measure of the core - core velocity dispersion in the cluster .",
    "the six cores , a - f , have a dispersion @xmath70  and extend over an area with radius @xmath71  pc . together ,",
    "these imply a virial mass , @xmath72 .",
    "this is less than the total interstellar mass estimated from the continuum observations but is likely much greater than the final stellar mass of the system @xcite .",
    "thus , although the system is currently bound , as the surrounding gas is dispersed through , e.g. , stellar outflows , it is likely to become unbound @xcite .",
    "an unbound cluster expands and its age may be estimated from its size and expansion rate .",
    "this effect is seen in optically visible clusters in orion over a range of ages @xmath73  myr @xcite but the morphology of the two groups irs1,2 in figure  [ fig : bolo ] suggests that it may apply to considerably earlier times . in irs2 , if @xmath74 is due to the expansion of the protostellar group , the formation time can be estimated from its crossing time , @xmath75  yr , characteristic of late class i sources @xcite .",
    "the gravitational attraction of the gas around the stellar group should slow their expansion , and the crossing time is therefore an upper limit to the cluster age . given the continued infall onto the cluster and the large envelope mass , it is not clear if the cluster is actually expanding and whether the crossing time is a useful measure of the cluster age at these early stages in its formation but the suggestive morphology and flux densities of the continuum maps are compelling .",
    "additional observations of other embedded stellar groups in this and other regions will show if there is a consistent pattern . in this regard",
    ", we note that a very short integration toward a more extended ( and therefore possibly more evolved ) group of iras sources @xmath76 north of irs2 did not detect @xmath7 m emission to an rms flux level of 0.1  jy  beam .",
    "we have mapped two embedded stellar groups , irs1 and irs2 , in the ngc2264 region in the continuum at @xmath7 m and the @xmath0 lines of  and 13cop .",
    "the former shows the thermal emission from the dusty envelopes around the clusters and their protostellar members and the latter show the flows around them ; the optically thick  diagnosing relative motions ( infall and outflow ) and the optically thin 13cop  revealing the bulk motion of the clusters and the protostellar velocity dispersion within irs2 .",
    "the two groups have a similar total mass , @xmath77 , but irs1 has a much higher peak flux density and is more compact than the more dispersed , lower surface brightness irs2 . in irs1 , comparing the continuum flux density with the integrated line intensity shows that the 13cop  abundance is constant across the clump at the @xmath30 resolution of these data .",
    "average  spectra are fit with a radially symmetric model constrained by the dust and 13cop  data and show a large scale collapse with an infall speed @xmath1  and mass infall rate @xmath78 , falling onto an inner core expanding at speed @xmath53  .",
    "more detailed observations of the competing processes of infall and outflow will show its role in determining stellar masses .",
    "large scale collapse with a similar infall speed and mass infall rate are found in irs2 but detailed modeling is precluded by the complex structure that is resolved within .",
    "flows around individual protostars show a mixture of dynamical states ranging from localized collapse with the same speed as the large scale collapse and mass infall rate , @xmath79 , to expansion at speeds @xmath80  . by averaging spectra over increasingly larger size scales , the influence of any one protostar",
    "was found to be limited to within a radius @xmath81  pc .",
    "the 13cop  spectra in irs2 was used to measure the protostellar velocity dispersion and thereby infer the virial mass of the system .",
    "this was found to be less than the total mass enveloping the cluster but more than the stellar mass indicating that the group is destined to become unbound as the surrounding gas and dust are dispersed by protostellar winds and outflows .",
    "the expansion of an unbound stellar group may already have started in irs2 where the greater separation of individual protostars and the low column density toward them , relative to irs1 , both suggest a more evolved system . in this case , an upper limit to its age , @xmath82  yr , can be determined kinematically by assuming a constant expansion speed equal to the observed protostellar velocity dispersion .",
    "additional observations of other clusters are necessary to see if there is a pattern between cluster sizes , velocity dispersion , and evolutionary state , but this technique  a well known tool for optical clusters  may be a useful new approach for following protocluster and protostellar evolution .",
    "the dominant mode of stellar birth is in groups and these observations provide new insight into their formation . to examine cluster formation at earlier times",
    "will require higher resolution observations of dense , compact cores such as irs1 , while large scale , high sensitivity imaging of the dust and gas around more evolved systems than irs2 can follow the evolution at later times than discussed here .",
