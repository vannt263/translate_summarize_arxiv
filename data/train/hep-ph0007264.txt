    "in the last few years the research work was concentrated on possible existence of the quark - gluon plasma phase , considering of unconfined quarks and gluons at high temperature or high density . in the laboratory ,",
    "nucleus - nucleus collisions at very high energies provide a promising way to produce high temperature or high - density matter .",
    "as estimated by bajorken [ 1 ] the energy density can be so high that these reactions might be utilized to explore the existence of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "one of the many factors that lead to an optimistic assessment that matter at high density and high temperature may be produced with nucleus - nucleus collisions is the occurrence of multiple collisions . by this mean ,",
    "a nucleon of one nucleus may collide with many nucleons in the other and deposits a large amount of energy in the collision region . in the nucleon - nucleon center of mass system ,",
    "the longitudinal inter - nucleon spacing between target nucleons are lorentz contracted and can be smaller than 1 fm in high - energy collisions . on the other hand",
    ", particle production occurs only when a minimum distance of about 1 fm separates the leading quark and antiquark in the nucleon - nucleon center of mass system [ 2,3 ] .",
    "therefore when the projectile nucleon collides with many target nucleons , particles production arising from the first n - n collision is not finished before the collision of the projectile with another target nucleon begins .",
    "there are models [ 4 - 11 ] that describe how is the second collision is affected by the first one . nevertheless , the fundamental theory of doing that remains one of the unsolved problems .",
    "experimental data suggest that after the projectile nucleon makes a collision , the projectile - like object that emerges from the first collision appears to continue to collide with other nucleons in the target nucleus on its way through the target nucleus . in each collision",
    "the object that emerges along the projectile nucleon direction has a net baryon number of unity because of the conservation of the baryon number .",
    "one can speak loosely of this object as the projectile or baryon - like object and can describe the multiple collision process in terms of the projectile nucleon making many collisions with the target nucleons . then , losing energy and momentum in the process , and emerging from the other side of the target with a much diminished energy .",
    "the number of collisions depends on the thickness of the target nucleus .",
    "experimental evidence of occurrence of multiple collision process can be best illustrated with the data of p - a reactions in the projectile fragmentation region [ 3 , 12 ] . in the present work we shall investigate the particle production mechanism in heavy ion collision by extending the multi - peripheral model [ 13 - 15 ] to the nucleon - nucleus and then generalize to the nucleus - nucleus case .",
    "the paper is organized so that in section * 2 * , we present the experimental features of high - energy events .",
    "this will serve in setting the boundary condition of the extended problem and building up the model in a realistic form .",
    "the hypothesis of the multi - peripheral model is demonstrated in section *  3*. the nucleon - nucleon case is briefly described in * 3.1 * and the extension to the nucleon - nucleus and the nucleus - nucleus collisions are followed in section * 3.2 * and * 3.3 * respectively .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section * 4*.",
    "the heavy ion collisions initiate the chance of processing multiple collisions of single nucleon - nucleon ( n - n ) events .",
    "this behavior allows the magnification of any small signal that may appear unclear in (",
    "n - n ) event .",
    "the magnification increases as the size of the interacting nuclei increases . nevertheless , the relation is not simply linear but many other factors are expected to contribute the complexity of the problem .",
    "the study of the multiplicity distribution at different rapidity intervals carries valuable information in this sense [ 16 ] .",
    "the rapidity range is classified into regions that characterizes the type of the interaction .",
    "the target and the projectile fragmentation regions contain the fast particles characterizing the forward and backward production from the fragmentation of both the target and the projectile nuclei in their center of mass system .",
    "the central rapidity interval is the hot region of the reaction .",
    "it sends global information about the strong interactions inside the nuclear bowl .",
    "moreover , signals about ( qgp ) may be extracted from the study of this region .",
    "( 1 ) shows the experimental data of the rapidity distributions of fast particles produced in the interaction of sulfur - projectile with proton , sulfur , silver and gold as target nuclei at 200 a gev incident energy [ 17 ] .",
    "the average multiplicity at each rapidity interval depends on the incident projectile energy ( which is fixed in this case ) and the size of the interacting nuclei .",
    "the nucleus - nucleus ( a - a ) collision may be seen as n - n base or n - a base . to put the problem in a quantitative measurable form ,",
    "we define a multiplication factor _ mf ( n_n ) _ as a base of (",
    "n - n ) ;    @xmath1    and the multiplication factor mf ( n - a ) as a base of ( n - a ) ;    @xmath2    fig .",
    "( 2 ) and fig . ( 3 ) show the multiplication factors based on ( n - n ) and ( n - a ) for the different reactions .",
    "the multiplication factor has maximum value at the central rapidity region ( y0 ) in both cases .",
    "the experimental data of p - s and the s - s collisions show constant value allover the rapidity range . nevertheless , it is difficult to estimate the number of base - collisions in each reaction from this approach .",
    "an alternative approach is to renormalize the rapidity distribution to get a scaled function that is independent on the projectile and target size .",
    "the average number of encountered nucleons from the target by an incident hadron [ 16,18 ] is a good measure of the number of collisions inside a target nucleus .",
    "this is defined as ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the total inelastic cross section of ( h - n ) and ( n - a ) respectively . by analogy , the average number of binary ( n - n ) collisions inside the ( a - a ) collision may be defined as ,    @xmath6    @xmath7 is the total inelastic cross section of ( a - a ) collision at the same incident energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the average number of collisions based to n - a is defined as ,    @xmath8    is total inelastic cross section of ( h - at ) collision .",
    "the scaling function is then obtained by dividing the rapidity distribution by the average number of collisions or . the resultant",
