    "superfluid pairing plays an important role in the study of nuclear structure . in infinite systems",
    "the pairing gap @xmath9 vanishes at a temperature @xmath10 , which is the critical temperature of the superfluid - normal ( sn ) phase transition . in deformed nuclei , the coriolis force , which breaks the cooper pairs , increases with the total angular momentum up to a certain critical angular momentum @xmath11 , where all cooper pairs are broken and the nucleus undergoes the sn phase transition , as suggested by the mottelson - valatin effect  @xcite",
    "the combination of temperature and angular momentum effects causes the pairing reentrance phenomenon , which was predicted 50 years ago by kammuri  @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation of this phenomenon was given by moretto  @xcite as follows .",
    "in spherical nuclei at @xmath12 0 , the total angular momentum @xmath13 is made up by the nucleons from the broken pairs , which occupy the single - particle levels around the fermi surface and block them against the scattered pairs .",
    "as @xmath13 increases , more levels around the fermi surface are blocked , which make the pairing correlations decrease until a sufficiently large total angular momentum @xmath14 , where the pairing gap @xmath9 completely vanishes in infinite systems .",
    "the increase of @xmath4 spreads the quasiparticles , which occupy the levels near the fermi surface , farther away from it .",
    "some levels become partially unoccupied , which are available for scattered pairs . as the result ,",
    "when @xmath4 reaches a critical value @xmath15 , the pairing correlations are energetically favored , and the pairing gap reappears . as @xmath4 goes higher , the increase of a large number of quasiparticles quenches and eventually breaks down the pairing gap at @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "it is now well known that , because of thermal fluctuations in finite nuclei , the paring gap does not vanish at @xmath18 and/or @xmath11 , but moronically decreases with increasing @xmath4 and/or @xmath13 .",
    "the pairing reentrance in finite nuclei is also modified so that the pairing gap remains finite after its first reappearance at finite @xmath4 and @xmath13 .",
    "it has been shown within the phonon damping model ( pdm )  @xcite that the presence of a thermal pairing gap at @xmath19 makes the width of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) remain nearly unchanged at low temperatures ( @xmath20 1 mev ) in heavy nuclei .",
    "this lecture will show the most recent experimental facts that support this mechanism .",
    "it also demonstrates that the recently observed enhancement of the nuclear level densities  @xcite is a clear evidence of pairing reentrance in @xmath1pd  @xcite . in the description of the gdr width in hot rotating nuclei ,",
    "the pdm has been extended to include the effect of angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the predictions of the pdm agree well with the latest experimental data for the gdr in highly excited @xmath2mo .",
    "finally , the gdr widths and energies predicted by the pdm and experimentally extracted are also used to calculate the shear viscosity of finite hot nuclei .",
    "the pairing pairing hamiltonian for a spherical system rotating about the symmetry @xmath21 axis , where the total angular momentum @xmath13 is completely determined by its @xmath21-projection @xmath22 alone , has the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of a particle ( neutron or proton ) in the @xmath25-th state , whereas @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the single - particle energies , chemical potential and rotation frequency for an axially deformed system , respectively .",
    "this hamiltonian was used to derive the ftbcs1 equations , which consist of a set of ftbcs ( finite - temperature bcs ) -based equations , corrected by the effects of quasiparticle - number fluctuations .",
    "the ftbcs1 equation for the pairing gap is written as a sum of the level - independent term @xmath9 and level - dependent term @xmath29 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33/2 $ ] , @xmath34/2 $ ] , @xmath35 , @xmath36^{-1}$ ] . with the quasiparticle - number fluctuations @xmath37 .",
    "the equations for the particle number and total angular momentum are @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath39 , respectively , with @xmath40 being the angular momentum projection quantum number . by solving these ftbcs1 equations",
    ", one can easily calculate the total energy @xmath41 and entropy @xmath42 of the system , from which the level density @xmath43 is calculated by using the invert laplace transformation of the grand partition function  @xcite .",
    "the total level density @xmath44 of a system with the total energy @xmath41 is a sum of @xmath13-dependent level densities ( densities of states ) , namely @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath13-dependent level density @xmath46 is calculated by differentiating @xmath43 , that is @xmath47 .",
    "recently , a series of measurements has been conducted at the bhabha atomic research center for the reaction @xmath48c + @xmath49nb @xmath50 @xmath51ag@xmath52 @xmath50 @xmath1pd@xmath52 @xmath53 p at the projectile energy @xmath54 40 - 45 mev  @xcite . in these experiments the exclusive proton spectra in coincidence with a @xmath55-ray multiplicity detector array reveal broad structures at higher multiplicities and energies .",
    "the obtained spectra including these broad structures can be fitted by using the statistical model only after multiplying the phenomenological level densities for @xmath1pd by an enhancement function , which depends on excitation energy and angular momentum .",
    "it has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that this enhancement might come from the pairing reentrance .    the level - weighted pairing gaps @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 being the sum of all levels ) obtained within the conventional ftbcs show no pairing reentrance .",
    "the ftbcs neutron and proton gaps shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ prolate ] decrease with increasing @xmath58 ( or @xmath4 ) and collapses at some @xmath59 , whose value decreases as @xmath13 increases . at the same time , the ftbcs1 gaps do not vanish at @xmath60 0 . at @xmath61 20@xmath62",
    "they decrease monotonically as @xmath58 increases and remain finite even at @xmath60 15 mev .",
    "the pairing reentrance shows up at @xmath63 20@xmath62 for neutrons and at @xmath63 30@xmath62 for protons , where the gaps first increase with @xmath58 then decrease as @xmath58 increases further but do not vanish even at high @xmath58 .",
    "since this pairing reentrance takes place at rather high values of @xmath13 , where the pairing gaps already vanish within the ftbcs , its origin resides in the quasiparticle number fluctuations @xmath64 in the ftbcs1 gap equation .    our preliminary calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite show that the corresponding level densities obtained within the ftbcs are smooth for all values of @xmath58 and @xmath13 , whereas those predicted by the ftbcs1 have a local enhancement at 2 @xmath65 4.5 mev for all values of @xmath13 under consideration . for @xmath66 0.276 , the ftbcs1 predictions agree fairly well with the empirical level densities obtained at @xmath67 30@xmath62 [ see figs .",

    "the fact that theoretical and empirical level densities agree well for @xmath67 30@xmath62 at @xmath66 0.276 , and for @xmath69 30@xmath62 at @xmath68 is a clear indication of a transition from a prolate shape at @xmath67 30@xmath62 to an oblate shape at higher @xmath13 .",
    "the pdm hamiltonian includes the independent single - particle ( quasiparticle ) field , gdr phonon field , and the coupling between them  @xcite .",
    "the single - particle energies @xmath26 are obtained within the woods - saxon potentials .",
    "the gdr width @xmath70 consists of the quantal width , @xmath71 , and thermal width , @xmath72 , as @xmath73 . including thermal pairing , the quantal and thermal widths are given as @xmath74^{2}(1-n_{p}-n_{h } )",

    "the parameter @xmath81 is chosen so that @xmath82 at @xmath12 0 is equal to gdr s width at @xmath12 0 , whereas the parameter @xmath83 is chosen so that , with varying @xmath4 , the gdr energy @xmath84 does not change significantly .",
    "the latter is found as the solution of the equation @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the energy of the gdr phonon before the coupling between the phonon and single - particle mean fields is switched on , and @xmath87 is the polarization operator owing to this coupling ( its expression is given in ref .",

    "[ width ] in comparison with the experimental systematics for @xmath92tc  @xcite , @xmath93tl  @xcite , and @xmath94pb  @xcite .",
    "the pdm results for open shell nuclei include the effect of non - vanishing thermal pairing gap owing to thermal fluctuations in finite nuclei .",
    "the pdm is the only up - to - date semi - microscopic model that is able to describe well the experimental data in the entire temperature region including @xmath20 1 mev as well as high @xmath4 , where the gdr width seems to saturate .    to describe the non - collective rotation of a spherical nucleus",
    ", the @xmath21-projection @xmath22 of the total angular momentum @xmath13 is added into the pdm hamiltonian as @xmath95 , where @xmath55 is the rotation frequency  @xcite .",
    "the latter and the chemical potential are defined , in the absence of pairing , from the equation @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the particle number and @xmath99 are the single - particle occupation numbers , @xmath100 $ ] , and @xmath101 .",
    "the prediction of the pdm for the gdr line shape agrees remarkably well with the latest experimental date for @xmath2mo at high @xmath4 and @xmath13  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "for the application of hydrodynamics to nuclear system , the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle requires a finite viscosity for any thermal fluid .",
    "kovtun , son and starinets ( kss )  @xcite conjectured that the specific viscosity , which is the ratio @xmath5 of shear viscosity @xmath3 to the entropy volume density @xmath102 , is bounded at the lower end for all fluids by the universal value , which is called the kss bound ( or unit ) , @xmath103 .",
    "according to collective theories , one of the fundamental explanations for the giant resonance damping is the friction term ( viscosity ) of the neutron and proton fluids . by using the green - kubo s relation , ref .",
    "@xcite expresses the shear viscosity @xmath104 at finite @xmath4 in terms of the gdr s energies and widths at zero and finite @xmath4 as @xmath105^{2}}{e_{gdr}(t)^{2}+[\\gamma(t)/2]^{2}}~. \\label{eta1}\\ ] ]    the predictions for the shear viscosity @xmath3 and the specific viscosity @xmath5 by several theoretical models for @xmath106sn and @xmath94pb are plotted as functions of @xmath4 in fig .",

    "the latter are extracted from the experimental systematics for gdr in tin and lead regions   @xcite making use of eq .",
    "( [ eta1 ] ) .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ eta&ratio ] that the predictions by the pdm agree best with the empirical results .",
    "the ratio @xmath5 decreases sharply with increasing @xmath4 up to @xmath107 1.5 mev , starting from which the decrease gradually slows down to reach ( 2 - 3 ) kss units at @xmath12 5 mev .",
    "the fermi - liquid drop model ( fldm ) has a similar trend up to @xmath107 2 - 3 mev , but at higher @xmath4 ( @xmath108 3 mev for @xmath106sn or 2 mev for @xmath94pb ) both @xmath3 and @xmath5 with @xmath4 sharply increase . at @xmath12 5 mev the fldm model predicts the ratio @xmath5 within ( 3.7 - 6.5 ) kss units , that is roughly 1.5  2 times larger than the pdm predictions .",
    "the tsfm in two versions as adiabatic model ( am ) and phenomenological tsfm ( ptsfm ) show a similar trend for @xmath3 and @xmath5 , provided @xmath109 in the ptsfm calculations is reduced to 0.72@xmath110 .",
    "however both versions of tsfm overestimate @xmath3 at @xmath111 1.5 mev . based on these results and on a model - independent estimation",
    ", it is concluded that the pdm predicts 1.3 @xmath112 4 kss units for medium and heavy nuclei at @xmath12 5 mev .",
    "this is about ( 3 - 5 ) times smaller ( and of much less uncertainty ) than the value between ( 4 - 19 ) kss units predicted by the fldm for heavy nuclei  @xcite , where the same lower value @xmath1130.6@xmath110 was used .",
    "this lecture has confirmed that thermal pairing included in the phonon damping model ( pdm ) is indeed responsible for the nearly constant width of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) at low temperature @xmath0 1 mev .",
    "it also demonstrates that the enhancement , which has been observed in the recent experimentally extracted nuclear level densities in @xmath1pd at low excitation energy and various angular momenta , is the first experimental evidence of the pairing reentrance in finite ( hot rotating ) nuclei .",
    "the extension of the pdm to finite angular momentum offers predictions in excellent agreement with the latest experimental data of gdr in the compound nucleus @xmath2mo .",
    "the specific shear viscosity @xmath5 in several medium and heavy nuclei is calculated from the gdr widths and energies at zero and finite temperatures and found to decrease with increasing @xmath4 to reach @xmath6 at @xmath7 5 mev , which is almost the same value obtained for quark - gluon - plasma at @xmath8 170 mev .",
