    "observations such as x - ray sigmoids , flares , or eruptions strongly indicate the presence of substantial electric currents in the low solar corona ( below , say , @xmath0 ) , which are absent by definition in traditional potential field extrapolations @xcite . to account for the development and effects of these electric currents ,",
    "we have introduced a non - potential ( hereafter np ) model coupling the sun s photospheric and coronal magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the np model circumvents the problem of non - uniqueness which plagues the extrapolation of nonlinear force - free equilibria from observed photospheric magnetograms @xcite by building up currents in a time - dependent manner .",
    "the coronal magnetic field relaxes continually ( toward a nonlinear force - free state ) in response to shearing by large - scale photospheric motions , and new flux emergence .",
    "previous testing @xcite has shown this model to better approximate the real physics determining the large - scale coronal magnetic field .    to test the global np model ,",
    "@xcite compared the simulated magnetic field direction with the chirality of quiescent solar filaments observed in h@xmath1 over a 6-month period , finding excellent agreement .",
    "solar filaments are stable structures of ( relatively ) cool , dense plasma suspended well above the chromosphere @xcite , and overlying polarity inversion lines ( pils ) in the photospheric magnetic field .",
    "they are seen in both h@xmath1 and extreme ultraviolet , either against the solar disk or as prominences above the limb .",
    "the large - scale magnetic field in filaments is believed to be orientated along the filament axis .",
    "filaments may then be classified as having either dextral or sinistral chirality , according to the direction of this axial field relative to the underlying photospheric polarities ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "although a property of the filament magnetic field , @xcite showed that the chirality may often be determined from the orientation of barbs in h@xmath1 images , given only the photospheric polarities on either side of the filament channel .",
    "observations reveal a statistical preference for dextral chirality in the northern hemisphere and sinistral in the south @xcite , as indicated in figure [ fig1](a ) .    for filaments equatorward of about @xmath2 latitude",
    ", we were able to use the np model to explain both the observed pattern and how exceptions can occur .",
    "the chirality results from a number of competing effects , depending on the filament location @xcite .",
    "pils within individual active regions have chirality consistent with the helicity sign in the active region @xcite . but",
    "pils between or outside of active regions can be strongly affected by interactions between multiple regions  this explains many exceptions to the majority hemispheric pattern ( supported by the observations of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , over time , differential rotation can strengthen , weaken , or even reverse the chirality at a given pil @xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=30.0% ]    at higher latitudes , projection effects make it difficult to determine filament chirality through h@xmath1 barbs ( for example , polar crown filaments were omitted by * ? ? ?",
    "however , several sets of linear polarization measurements in limb prominences indicate the same hemispheric chirality pattern , both at solar minimum @xcite and in the rising phase of the solar cycle @xcite , although ( to our knowledge ) no studies during the declining phase have been published .",
    "this finding that the same hemispheric pattern holds at higher latitudes was not reproduced by our previous 6-month simulations for 1999 ( in the rising phase of cycle 23 ) , where the polar crown chirality was found to be opposite to that of lower latitudes .",
    "we attributed this result to the dominance of differential rotation on the east - west oriented polar crown pils .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig1](b ) , differential rotation alone leads to the wrong chirality overlying east - west oriented pils @xcite .",
    "however , the chirality of high - latitude pils in the np model is a balance between differential rotation and the poleward transport of magnetic helicity from lower latitudes .",
    "( we are assuming that there is no net injection of helicity from the unresolved small - scale motions . )",
    "the possibility therefore remains that there was simply insufficient time in the 6-month simulations for poleward transport of helicity . in this letter",
    "we extend the simulation to 15 years duration , simulating both the rising and decaying phases of the solar cycle , to explore the predicted chirality at high latitudes .",
    "we simulate the evolution of the large - scale photospheric and coronal magnetic fields between 1996 and 2011 , using the non - potential ( np ) model , which couples surface flux transport to magneto - frictional relaxation in the corona above @xcite .",
    "the large - scale mean magnetic field , @xmath3 , in the corona is evolved via the induction equation @xmath4 where we neglect ohmic diffusion and the mean electromotive force @xmath5 describes the effect of unresolved small - scale fluctuations .",
    "following @xcite we apply a hyperdiffusion @xmath6 where @xmath7 and we take @xmath8 .",
    "this form of hyperdiffusion preserves magnetic helicity density @xmath9 in the volume and describes the tendency of the magnetic field to relax to a state of constant @xmath10 @xcite , although such a state is never reached in the global simulation .",
    "we have repeated the simulation with a constant diffusivity ( @xmath11 ) with no change to the chirality results .",
    "the velocity is determined by the magneto - frictional technique @xcite as @xmath12 where the first term enforces relaxation toward a force - free equilibrium , and the second term is a radial outflow imposed only near the outer boundary ( @xmath13 ) to represent the effect of the solar wind radially distending magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "to run the simulation continuously over 15 years , we use a non - uniform spherical grid whose resolution reduces from @xmath14 grid points in longitude at the equator to only @xmath15 at the polar grid boundaries ( @xmath16 latitude ) .",
    "the simulation is initialised with a potential field extrapolation based on a synoptic magnetogram for carrington rotation cr1910 from us national solar observatory , kitt peak ( nso / kp ) , corrected for differential rotation to represent 1996 may 15 .",
    "the coronal magnetic field is then evolved continuously , driven by the emergence of new active regions and shearing by large - scale photospheric motions .",
    "the latter are imposed on the lower boundary @xmath17 through the standard surface flux transport model @xcite .",
    "here we use a supergranular diffusivity @xmath18 , the @xcite differential rotation profile , and the meridional flow profile of @xcite with peak speed @xmath19 . in order for the simulation to reproduce the low polar field strengths observed after reversal in cycle 23 , we reduce the active region tilt angles by 20% @xcite , and include an additional decay term for the photospheric magnetic field with a timescale of @xmath20 years @xcite .",
    "active regions are inserted in the form of idealised three - dimensional magnetic bipoles @xcite , whose properties ( location , size , magnetic flux and tilt angle ) are determined from nso / kp synoptic magnetograms . until 2003",
    "these were taken with the older vacuum telescope , and from 2003 onwards with solis ( synoptic optical long - term investigations of the sun ) .",
    "for the present simulations we do not insert any bipoles to replace those missed during the three data gaps ( cr2015 - 16 , cr2040 - 41 , cr2091 ) . in total , between cr1911 ( 1996 june ) and cr2110 ( 2011 may ) , we insert 1838 bipoles .",
    "the regions vary in flux content from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "as stated above , we reduce the tilt angles by 20% to help reproduce the low polar fields observed after reversal in cycle 23 .",
    "a linear fit to the reduced tilt angles gives @xmath23 , which reduces the slope of the relationship compared to the magnetogram observations of either @xcite ( who used nso / kp data for cycle 21 ) or @xcite ( who used soho / mdi magnetograms ) .",
    "however , it is still greater than found in the white light study of @xcite for cycles 15 to 21 . in principle",
    ", the same resulting polar fields could be obtained with the original bipole tilt angles by instead invoking a more complex meridional flow profile @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional bipoles have a twist parameter @xmath24 describing emergence of magnetic helicity within the bipole @xcite . since the vector magnetic observations required to determine @xmath24 are not available for every active region in cycle 23 , we select @xmath24 statistically for each new bipole @xcite .",
    "although we have shown that this emerging helicity affects the chirality of @xmath25 of filaments at lower latitudes @xcite , these are mainly those located within recently - emerged active regions . after only 3050 days , differential rotation tends to reverse the chirality of pils inside any bipoles inserted with the minority sign of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "thus the choice of @xmath24 distribution has little consequence for the higher latitudes considered here .",
    "we have verified that the same high latitude chirality pattern is recovered if @xmath26 for all bipoles .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows that the photospheric radial magnetic field @xmath27 in the observed magnetograms ( figure [ fig2]a ) is generally well reproduced by the simulation ( figure [ fig2]b ) .     over time , in ( a ) nso / kp synoptic magnetograms and ( b ) the simulation .",
    "three data gaps are evident in ( a ) .",
    "[ fig2],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    to analyse the chirality , snapshots of the global three - dimensional magnetic field were stored every 14 days during the simulation . for each snapshot , pils were identified automatically on the photosphere @xmath17 , along with the overlying chirality of the coronal magnetic field at height @xmath28 .",
    "we take @xmath29 to approximate the height of filaments .",
    "now denote the horizontal field at @xmath28 by @xmath30 , and the radial field in the photosphere by @xmath27 .",
    "we characterise the chirality at height @xmath28 by the `` skew '' @xmath31 so that @xmath32 corresponds to sinistral skew and @xmath33 to dextral skew . two example snapshots from the simulation , on 1999 june 24 and 2002 june 20 , are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the color shading along photospheric pils indicates the skew calculated above them .     at @xmath34 ( in mollweide equal - area projection ) , while right images show selected coronal field lines traced from this height .",
    "dextral skew corresponds to @xmath35 ( red ) and sinistral to @xmath36 ( blue ) . in both cases ,",
    "grey shading shows @xmath27 on the photosphere @xmath37 ( white positive , black negative ; saturation @xmath38 ) .",
    "the left images are also available as an mpeg animation in the electronic edition of the journal .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    figure [ fig4](a ) shows the longitude - averaged skew angle along pils in 95 latitude bins , as a function of time through the simulation .",
    "several features are apparent :    1 .   in and around active regions",
    "the majority pattern of chirality predominates , i.e. , dextral in the northern hemisphere and sinistral in the southern hemisphere , although this is an overall mean pattern with significant local fluctuations in both magnitude and sign ( as seen in figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the origin of this pattern , including the exceptions , is explained by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "2 .   during the period of few active regions from 2007 to 2010 , there is more mixed chirality at lower latitudes .",
    "3 .   until 1998 , and during the declining phase from 2001 to 2006 , there is a tendency for minority chirality on the high - latitude pils ( sinistral in the north , dextral in the south ) .",
    "4 .   during the `` rush - to - the - poles '' between 1998 and mid-1999",
    ", the polar crowns exhibit the majority chirality pattern .",
    "5 .   from 2006 onward",
    ", the majority chirality dominates at high latitudes once more , continuing into the start of cycle 24 .    , and ( b ) current helicity density @xmath10 , during the cycle 23 non - potential simulation .",
    "both are measured at height @xmath34 .",
    "see the electronic edition of the journal for a color version of this figure .",
    "[ fig4],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    for comparison , [ fig4](c ) shows the longitude - averaged current helicity density @xmath10 ( equation [ eqn : alpha0 ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at the same height @xmath34 .",
    "as expected , the sign of @xmath10 correlates approximately with that of the skew angle , where positive @xmath10 is associated with negative skew angle , and _ vice versa_. ( the concentrations of @xmath10 at the poles are due to twisting up of the vertical field there by the differential rotation . )",
    "the chirality pattern at high latitudes in figure [ fig4](b ) differs from the earlier 6-month simulations @xcite . in those simulations , high - latitude filaments remained predominantly sinistral in the northern hemisphere and dextral in the southern hemisphere : opposite to the majority pattern . in the new 15-year simulation",
    ", the majority pattern is found in two independent epochs : once during the rising phase up to polar reversal ( including the period of the previous simulations ) , and again from the middle of the declining phase of cycle 23 .",
    "we argue that :    1 .   transport of helicity from active latitudes is responsible for overcoming the effect of differential rotation on the polar crown over much ( but not all ) of the cycle .",
    "the initial period of opposite chirality ( before 1999 ) is an artefact of the initial condition of the simulation , indicating the importance of magnetic memory in the corona .",
    "note that such a period of opposite chirality does not recur at the start of cycle 24 ( from 2009 ) .",
    "an example where differential rotation clearly wins over helicity transport is shown in figure [ fig3](b ) , during the declining phase of the solar cycle . here , minority dextral chirality is found on the poleward arm of a switchback in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the field lines ( figure [ fig3 ] , bottom right ) show a sheared arcade , long disconnected from active region flux .",
    "the tendency for minority chirality on such switchbacks in the declining but not in the rising phase matches the predictions made from single - bipole simulations by @xcite .    by constrast , the north polar crown during the rising phase prior to polar reversal ( figure [ fig3]a ) exhibits a strong flux rope with majority chirality , with field lines directly connecting to lower latitudes .",
    "to further demonstrate that the polar crown chirality is controlled by a balance between differential rotation and helicity transport , we repeated the simulation with the latitudinal differential gradient reduced to half of its original slope .",
    "this leads to less minority chirality at high latitudes ( figure [ fig5 ] ) , consistent with the greater dominance of helicity transport . even in the original simulation",
    ", majority chirality takes over at all latitudes later in the cycle ( from 2006 onward ) , because the highest - latitude pils at this time are nearer to the equator than those earlier in the cycle , so that helicity from lower latitudes can more easily dominate .     at height @xmath34 for the simulation with reduced differential rotation , showing reduced areas of minority chirality .",
    "( note that the longitude - averaged @xmath27 in the photosphere is not affected by changing the differential rotation ; * ? ? ?",
    "see the electronic edition of the journal for a color version of this figure .",
    "[ fig5],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the initial period of minority chirality at high latitudes does not recur at the start of cycle 24 in the simulation .",
    "this suggests it may be an artefact of the initial potential field .",
    "majority chirality on the polar crowns during the minimum and rising phase of the solar cycle would be required in order to be consistent with the reported polarization measurements @xcite . indeed ,",
    "when we simulate two consecutive cycles with emerging active regions chosen at random from statistical distributions ( not illustrated here ) , we find this minority chirality only at the start of the simulation , not at the start of subsequent cycles . because the high - latitude field depends on transport of helicity from lower latitudes , differential rotation dominates early in the simulation , producing minority chirality on the polar crowns . in effect",
    ", the high latitude field has a finite memory of around 12 months for the pre - existing magnetic topology at the start of the simulation .",
    "this explains why the previous 6-month simulations @xcite found minority chirality on the polar crowns in 1999 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the np model makes robust predictions for the chirality of high - latitude filaments : majority chirality over much of the cycle ( including during polar field reversal ) , but more mixed chirality between the polar reversal and middle of the declining phase .",
    "the first prediction matches the available polarization measurements of prominences from earlier solar cycles , but further measurements are needed to confirm the second prediction .",
    "mixed chirality is also predicted at lower latitudes during particularly quiet periods such as the recent cycle 23 minimum .",
    "there are some indications that the hemispheric pattern of active region helicity was also weaker during the declining phase of cycle 23 @xcite , although this remains statistically uncertain @xcite .",
    "however , the multitude of factors affecting filament chirality mean that we do not expect to see the same time variations in the filament and active region hemispheric patterns @xcite . testing our predictions against prominence measurements will best validate the np model for the global coronal magnetic field .",
    "of course , our model at present considers only the large - scale magnetic field within which filaments form .",
    "the smaller scale magnetic field structure inside filaments / prominences themselves is inferred to be rather complex and is the subject of ongoing research @xcite .",
