    "after an unpromising start , searches for ly@xmath0 emission are now proving to be a powerful means of detecting star - forming galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , competing in observing efficiency with techniques such as broad - band searches for lyman - break galaxies",
    ". the next generation of near - infrared instrumentation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will in principle allow ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies to be found up to @xmath4 , permitting a probe of the star formation history of the universe before the epoch when reionization is thought to have taken place .",
    "there are in fact a number of different mechanisms which can produce ly@xmath0 emission from high redshift objects .",
    "( 1 ) gas in galaxies which is photo - ionized by young stars will emit ly@xmath0 as hydrogen atoms recombine ; this was originally proposed as a signature of primeval galaxies by @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) gas can alternatively be ionized by radiation from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "( 3 ) intergalactic gas clouds are predicted to emit ly@xmath0 recombination radiation due to ionization of the gas by the intergalactic ultraviolet background ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( 4 ) gas within a dark matter halo which is cooling and collapsing to form a galaxy may radiate much of the gravitational collapse energy by collisionally - excited ly@xmath0 emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( 5 ) finally , ly@xmath0 can also be emitted from gas which has been shock heated by galactic winds or by jets in radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the majority of high - redshift ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) detected so far are compact , and appear to be individual galaxies in which the ly@xmath0 emission is powered by photoionization of gas by young stars .",
    "ly@xmath0 surveys have also found another class of emitter , the so - called ly@xmath0 blobs , in which the ly@xmath0 emission is much more extended than individual galaxies , and may be powered partly by agns or gas cooling @xcite .",
    "we will be focusing in this paper on ly@xmath0 emission powered by young stars , and so will not consider the ly@xmath0 blobs further .    to date , there has been relatively little theoretical work on trying to predict the properties of star - forming ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies within a realistic galaxy formation framework . @xcite",
    "made predictions for the number of emitters based on the halo mass function and using ad - hoc assumptions linking ly@xmath0 emission to halo mass , while @xcite made predictions for very high redshifts ( @xmath3 ) based on a gas - dynamical simulation .",
    "@xcite used gas - dynamical simulations to calculate ly@xmath0 emission both from star - forming objects and from the intergalactic medium in the redshift range @xmath5 . however , the first calculation of the abundance of ly@xmath0 emitters based on a detailed hierarchical galaxy formation model was that of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) . in paper",
    "i , we used the galform semi - analytical galaxy formation model to predict the abundance of star - forming ly@xmath0 emitters as a function of redshift in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model .",
    "the galform model computes the assembly of dark matter halos by mergers , and the growth of galaxies both by cooling of gas in halos and by galaxy mergers .",
    "it calculates the star formation history of each galaxy , including both quiescent star formation in galaxy disks and also bursts triggered by galaxy mergers , as well as the feedback effects of galactic winds driven by supernova explosions . in paper  i , we found that a very simple model , in which a fixed fraction of ly@xmath0 photons escape from each galaxy , regardless of its other properties , gave a surprisingly good match to the total numbers of ly@xmath0 emitters detected in different surveys over a range of redshifts .",
    "we also explored the impact of varying certain parameters in the model , such as the redshift of reionization of the intergalactic medium , on the abundance of emitters .    in this paper",
    ", we explore in more detail the fiducial model of paper  i ( based on an @xmath6 , spatially flat , @xmath1cdm model with a reionization redshift of @xmath7 ) .",
    "we use the full capability of the galform model to predict a wide range of galaxy properties , connecting various observables to ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "the galaxy formation model we use is the same as that proposed by @xcite .",
    "a critical assumption of this model is that stars formed in starbursts have a top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) , while stars formed quiescently in galactic disks have a solar neighbourhood imf .",
    "we showed in @xcite that , within the framework of @xmath1cdm , the top - heavy imf is essential for matching the counts and redshifts of sub - millimetre galaxies and the luminosity function of lyman break galaxies at @xmath8 ( once dust extinction is included ) , while remaining consistent with galaxy properties in the local universe such as the optical and far - ir luminosity functions and galaxy gas fractions and metallicities .",
    "more detailed comparisons of this model with observations of lyman - break galaxies and of galaxy evolution in the ir will be presented in lacey ( 2005a , 2005b , in preparation ) .",
    "the assumption of a top - heavy imf is controversial , but underpins the success of the model in explaining the high - redshift sub - mm and lyman - break galaxies .",
    "it is therefore important to test this model against as many observables as possible .",
    "@xcite showed that a top - heavy imf seems to be required to explain the metal content of the hot intracluster gas in galaxy clusters , and @xcite showed that a similar top - heavy imf also seems to be necessary to explain the observed abundances of @xmath0-elements ( such as mg ) in the stellar populations of elliptical galaxies . in the present paper , we explore the predictions of the @xcite model for the properties of ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies and compare them with observational data .",
    "we emphasize that our aim here is to explore in detail a particular galaxy formation model which has been shown to satisfy a wide range of other observational constraints , rather than to conduct a survey of ly@xmath0 predictions for different model parameters .    in section  [ sec : galform ]",
    ", we give an outline of the galform model , focusing on how the predictions we present later on are calculated .",
    "section  [ sec : lf - evoln ] examines the evolution of the ly@xmath0 luminosity function , and compares the model predictions with observational data over the redshift range @xmath9 . in section  [ sec : obs - props ] , we compare a selection of observed properties of ly@xmath0 emitters with the model predictions . in section  [ sec : phys - props ] , we look at some other predictions of the model , most of which can not currently be compared directly with observations .",
    "section  [ sec : high - z ] extends the predictions for the ly@xmath0 luminosity function to @xmath10 .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we use the semi - analytical model of galaxy formation , galform , to predict the ly@xmath0 emission and many other properties of galaxies as a function of redshift . the general methodology and approximations behind the galform model",
    "are set out in detail in @xcite .",
    "the particular model that we use in this paper is the same as that described by @xcite .",
    "the background cosmology is a cold dark matter universe with a cosmological constant ( @xmath6 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "below we review the physics behind the particular model predictions that we highlight in this paper .",
    "the galform model follows the main processes which shape the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "these include : ( i ) the collapse and merging of dark matter halos ; ( ii ) the shock - heating and radiative cooling of gas inside dark halos , leading to formation of galaxy disks ; ( iii ) quiescent star formation in galaxy disks ; ( iv ) feedback both from supernova explosions and from photo - ionization of the igm ; ( v ) chemical enrichment of the stars and gas ; ( vi ) galaxy mergers driven by dynamical friction within common dark matter halos , leading to formation of stellar spheroids , and also triggering bursts of star formation .",
    "the end product of the calculations is a prediction of the number of galaxies that reside within dark matter haloes of different masses .",
    "the model predicts the stellar and cold gas masses of the galaxies , along with their star formation and merger histories , and their sizes and metallicities .",
    "the prescriptions and parameters for the different processes which we use in this paper are identical to @xcite .",
    "feedback is treated in a similar way to @xcite : energy injection by supernovae reheats some of the gas in galaxies and returns it to the halo , but also ejects some gas from halos as a `` superwind '' - the latter is essential for reproducing the observed cutoff at the bright end of the present - day galaxy luminosity function .",
    "we also include feedback from photo - ionization of the igm : following reionization ( i.e. for @xmath15 ) , we assume that gas cooling in halos with circular velocities @xmath16 is completely suppressed . we assume in this paper that reionization occurs at @xmath17 ,",
    "chosen to be intermediate between the low value @xmath18 suggested by measurements of the gunn - peterson trough in quasars @xcite and the high value @xmath19 suggested by the wmap measurement of polarization of the microwave background @xcite .",
    "our model has two different imfs : quiescent star formation in galactic disks is assumed to produce stars with a solar neighbourhood imf ( we use the @xcite paramerization , with slope @xmath20 below @xmath21 and @xmath22 above ) , whereas bursts of star formation triggered by galaxy mergers are assumed to form stars with a top - heavy , flat imf with slope @xmath23 ( where the salpeter slope is @xmath24 ) . in either case , the imf covers the mass range @xmath25 . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the choice of a flat imf in bursts is essential for the model to reproduce the observed counts of galaxies at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "the parameters for star formation in disks and for triggering bursts and morphological transformations in galaxy mergers are given in @xcite .",
    "the sizes of galaxies are computed as in @xcite : gas which cools in a halo is assumed to conserve its angular momentum as it collapses , forming a rotationally - supported galaxy disk ; the radius of this disk is then calculated from its angular momentum , including the gravity of the disk , spheroid ( if any ) and dark halo .",
    "galaxy spheroids are built up both from pre - existing stars in galaxy mergers , and from the stars formed in bursts triggered by these mergers ; the radii of spheroids formed in mergers are computed using an energy conservation argument . in calculating the sizes of disks and spheroids ,",
    "we include the adiabatic contraction of the dark halo due to the gravity of the baryonic components .    given the star formation and metal enrichment history of a galaxy , galform computes the spectrum of the integrated stellar population using a population synthesis model based on the padova stellar evolution tracks ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "broad - band magnitudes are then computed by redshifting the galaxy spectrum and convolving it with the filter response functions .",
    "we include extinction of the stellar continuum by dust in the galaxy ; this is computed based on a two - phase model of the dust distribution , in which stars are born inside giant molecular clouds and then leak out into a diffuse dust medium ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "the optical depth for dust extinction of the diffuse component is calculated from the mass and metallicity of the cold gas and the sizes of the disk and bulge .",
    "we note that the extinction predicted by our model in which the stars and dust are mixed together is very different from what one obtains if all of the dust is in a foreground screen ( as is commonly assumed in other theoretical models ) .",
    "finally , we also include the effects on the observed stellar continuum of absorption and scattering of radiation by intervening neutral hydrogen along the line of sight to the galaxy ; we calculate this igm attenuation using the formula of @xcite , which is based on the observed statistics of neutral hydrogen absorbers seen in quasar spectra .",
    "we compute the ly@xmath0 luminosities of galaxies by the following procedure : ( i ) the model calculates the integrated stellar spectrum of the galaxy as described above , based on its star formation history , and including the effects of the distribution of stellar metallicities and of variations in the imf .",
    "( ii ) we compute the rate of production of lyman continuum ( lyc ) photons by integrating over the stellar spectrum , and assume that all of these ionizing photons are absorbed by neutral hydrogen within the galaxy .",
    "we assume photoionization equilibrium applies within each galaxy , producing ly@xmath0 photons according to case  b recombination ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note that for solar metallicity , 11 times as many lyc and ly@xmath0 photons are produced per unit mass of stars formed for our top - heavy ( burst ) imf as compared to our solar neighbourhood ( disk ) imf .",
    "( iii ) the observed ly@xmath0 flux or luminosity of a galaxy depends on the fraction @xmath26 of ly@xmath0 photons which escape from the galaxy .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons are resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen , and absorbed by dust .",
    "early estimates of this process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed that only a tiny fraction of ly@xmath0 photons should escape from a static neutral galaxy ism if even a tiny amount of dust is present .",
    "many star - forming galaxies are nonetheless observed to have significant ly@xmath0 luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this is generally ascribed to the presence of galactic winds in these systems , which allow ly@xmath0 photons to escape after many fewer resonant scatterings .",
    "radiative transfer calculations of ly@xmath0 through winds have shown that this process can explain the asymmetric ly@xmath0 line profiles which are typically observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the effects of radiative transfer of ly@xmath0 through clumpy dust and gas have been considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "calculating ly@xmath0 escape fractions from first principles is clearly very complicated , and so we instead adopt a simpler approach . in paper",
    "i , we found that assuming a fixed escape fraction @xmath26 for each galaxy , regardless of its dust properties , resulted in a surprisingly good agreement between the predicted number counts of emitters and the available observations . in that paper , we chose @xmath27 to match the number counts at @xmath28 at a flux @xmath29 , and we use the same value of @xmath26 in this paper .",
    "although this extreme simplification of a constant escape fraction may seem implausible , it does give a reasonably good match to the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity functions and equivalent widths at different redshifts , as we show in the next sections .",
    "our calculations do not include any attenuation of the ly@xmath0 flux from a galaxy by propagation through the igm .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons can be scattered out of the line - of - sight by any neutral hydrogen in the igm close to the galaxy .",
    "if the emitting galaxy is at a redshift before reionization , when the igm was still mostly neutral , this could in principle strongly suppress the observed ly@xmath0 flux @xcite .",
    "however , various effects can greatly reduce the amount of attenuation : ionization of the igm around the galaxy @xcite , clearing of the igm by galactic winds , gravitational infall of the igm towards the galaxy , and redshifting of the ly@xmath0 emission by scattering in a wind @xcite . in any case , since measurements of gunn - peterson absorption in quasars show that reionization must have occured at @xmath30 , attenuation of ly@xmath0 fluxes by the igm should not affect our predictions for @xmath31 , but only our predictions for very high redshifts given in section  [ sec : high - z ] .",
    "= 8.5truecm    = 16.truecm",
    "a basic prediction of our model is the evolution of the luminosity function of ly@xmath0 emitters with redshift .",
    "this depends on the distribution of star formation rates in quiescent and starburst galaxies ( with solar neighbourhood and top - heavy imfs respectively ) , and on the metallicity with which the stars are formed .",
    "paper  i showed predictions for the cumulative number counts of emitters per unit redshift as a function of observed ly@xmath0 flux . here",
    "we focus on a closely related quantity , the cumulative space density of emitters as a function of ly@xmath0 luminosity at different redshifts .",
    "fig.[fig : lf_lowz ] shows the cumulative luminosity function of ly@xmath0 emitters predicted by our standard model for a set of redshifts over the interval @xmath32 .",
    "the model luminosity function initially gets brighter with increasing redshift , peaking at @xmath8 , before declining again in number density at even higher redshifts .",
    "the increase in the luminosity function from @xmath33 to @xmath34 is driven both by the increase in galaxy star formation rates , and by the increasing fraction of star formation occuring in bursts ( which have a top - heavy imf ) .",
    "as shown in fig.1 in @xcite , the model predicts that the fraction of all star formation occuring in bursts increases from @xmath35 at @xmath33 to @xmath36 at @xmath37 and then to @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "we compare the model predictions with observational estimates of the cumulative ly@xmath0 luminosity function in fig.[fig : lf_4panel ] , where we show different redshifts in different panels .",
    "the observational estimates of the luminosity functions which we plot have been calculated by @xcite ( and also s.  lilly , private communication , for @xmath40 ) from published data on surveys for laes , assuming the same cosmology as we assume in our models .",
    "the observed luminosity functions in the figures are labelled according to the survey from which they were obtained . in each case , surveys using narrow - band filters were used to find candidates for laes at particular redshifts , and then either broad - band colours or follow - up spectroscopy were used to determine which of the candidates were likely to be real ly@xmath0 emitters , and which were likely to be lower - redshift interlopers resulting from other emission lines falling within the narrow - band filter response .",
    "the surveys with spectroscopic follow - up which we plot are @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lala ) and @xcite , while the surveys using only colour selection are ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cadis ) , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also show the data of @xcite at @xmath41 from a spectroscopic survey of gravitationally - lensed fields .",
    "the stepped appearance of most of the observed luminosity functions results from the small number of objects in most of the samples ; each step corresponds to the inclusion of an additional object as the luminosity is reduced .",
    "the cumulative luminosity functions cut off at the bright end where the observational samples contain only one object of that luminosity ; the statistical uncertainties are correspondingly largest at the highest luminosities . for reference",
    ", we note that the luminosity distance for our assumed cosmology is @xmath42 for @xmath43 respectively , so that a ly@xmath0 flux of @xmath44 at each of these redshifts corresponds to a luminosity @xmath45 respectively .",
    "the lower luminosity limits on the observed luminosity functions correspond to roughly the same ly@xmath0 flux limit @xmath46 at each redshift .    in fig.[fig :",
    "lf_4panel ] , the predictions for our standard model ( with a top - heavy imf in bursts and @xmath27 ) are shown by solid lines .",
    "we also show the separate contributions of bursting and quiescently star - forming galaxies respectively as dotted and short - dashed lines . in most cases ,",
    "the dotted line is barely distinguishable from the solid line , showing that the model ly@xmath0 luminosity function is completely dominated by bursts over the range of redshift and luminosity plotted in fig.[fig : lf_4panel ] .",
    "overall , there is broad agreement between the predicted and observed luminosity functions over the redshift range @xmath47 .",
    "this is remarkable , since we allowed ourselves to adjust only one model parameter to fit the observational data , namely the ly@xmath0 escape fraction @xmath26 .",
    "the model luminosity functions do not perfectly match all of the observational data , but where there are differences between the model and observational data , there are also equally large differences between different observational datasets",
    ". the differences between different observational datasets could be due to a combination of ( a ) statistical fluctuations ( most of the samples are small ) , ( b ) field - to - field variance due to galaxy clustering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( c ) differences in the details of how the samples are selected ( e.g. differences in the equivalent width limit or photometric criteria applied ) , and ( d ) differing levels of contamination by objects which are not ly@xmath0 emitters . we note that the model predictions shown in fig.[fig : lf_4panel ] do not include any limit on the equivalent width ( ew ) of the ly@xmath0 emission line , while the observational data shown all incorporate different lower limits on the ew of line emission as well as on the line flux .",
    "however , as we show in  [ sec : ew ] , these ew thresholds are predicted not to significantly affect the comparison of model and observed luminosity functions in fig.[fig : lf_4panel ] .",
    "the value of the ly@xmath0 escape fraction which we find fits the data , @xmath27 , is quite small .",
    "this is mainly because , over the range of redshift and luminosity probed by the observations , the counts of objects in our standard model are dominated by bursts , and we have assumed a top - heavy imf in bursts . as noted above , the ly@xmath0 luminosity for a given star formation rate is about 10 times larger with the top - heavy imf than with a solar neighbourhood imf .",
    "we also show in fig.[fig : lf_4panel ] by long - dashed lines the predictions of a variant model , in which we assume the same kennicutt imf for bursts and quiescent star formation , and with @xmath48 . even though we have chosen @xmath26 for this variant model to provide the best overall match to the observational data in fig.[fig :",
    "lf_4panel ] , we see that it agrees somewhat less well with the data than does our standard model , especially at @xmath49 , where it predicts more low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "moreover , this variant model dramatically under - predicts both the counts of sub - mm galaxies and the number of lyman - break galaxies ( see fig.5(a ) in @xcite ) .",
    "we have also investigated the effect on the predicted luminosity functions of changing the igm reionization redshift from our standard value @xmath17 . as described in  [ sec : galform ] , this affects galaxies in our model through photo - ionization feedback . for our standard model , we find that varying @xmath50 over the range 6.5 to 20 changes the luminosity function by less than the scatter between different observational datasets in fig.[fig : lf_4panel ] , over the range of luminosity and redshift probed by those data . choosing a different value of @xmath50 in this range would therefore not significantly affect any of the conclusions we draw here .    @xcite have computed luminosity functions of ly@xmath0 emitters from a numerical simulation , including emission from gas heated by shocks and by the intergalactic ionizing background as well as emission from star - forming regions in galaxies .",
    "they assume that stars all form with a salpeter imf .",
    "however , the luminosity functions which they compute combine all of the emission from each dark matter halo , and so are different from the luminosity functions of individual galaxies which our model predicts .",
    "furthermore , they effectively assume an escape fraction @xmath51 for ly@xmath0 emission from star formation .",
    "they do not make any detailed comparison with observational data on ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies , but note that their luminosity functions predict roughly an order - of - magnitude more objects than are observed over the range @xmath52 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with what we would find if we assumed a kennicutt imf for all star formation and @xmath53 .",
    "now that we have established that our model gives a very good match to the luminosity function of ly@xmath0 emitters at different redshifts , we turn our attention to other observable properties of these objects .",
    "we first present predictions for the distribution of ly@xmath0 equivalent widths (  4.1 ) , before examining the broad - band continuum magnitudes of ly@xmath0 emitters (  4.2 ) and , finally , the size distribution of emitters (  4.3 ) .",
    "our model allows a simple prediction for the equivalent width ( ew ) of the ly@xmath0 emission line in each galaxy : we divide the luminosity in the emission line by the mean luminosity per unit wavelength of the stellar continuum on either side of the line .",
    "we distinguish between the _ net _ and _ intrinsic _ line and stellar luminosities and equivalent widths .",
    "net _ values are obtained after we multiply the ly@xmath0 luminosity by the escape fraction @xmath26 and after we attenuate the stellar luminosity by dust extinction , while the _ intrinsic _ values are those before we include either the ly@xmath0 escape fraction or dust attenuation .",
    "a limitation of our current model is that it does not include the effects of absorption of ly@xmath0 , so the equivalent widths we calculate are always positive ( or zero ) .",
    "ly@xmath0 absorption features ( corresponding to negative equivalent widths ) could be produced either by absorption in stellar atmospheres @xcite , or by neutral gas within the galaxy or in an expanding shell or wind around it @xcite .",
    "our calculations are therefore incomplete , but nevertheless represent an important first step .",
    "fig.[fig : ew ] shows the model predictions for rest - frame equivalent widths of ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies at z=3 .",
    "the most remarkable feature of these plots is the wide spread of ews predicted by the model .",
    "this is seen most clearly in the middle panel , which shows the distribution of equivalent widths for galaxies selected to have ly@xmath0 fluxes in the range @xmath54 .",
    "we see that there is a big difference between the distributions of intrinsic and net ews ( shown by dashed and solid lines respectively ) . for this flux range ,",
    "the intrinsic rest - frame ew has a median value of 130 , and most galaxies have ews in the range 100200 .",
    "these values are similar to the predictions of @xcite .",
    "the spread in intrinsic ews results mostly from the spread in burst ages and timescales . for the same galaxies , the net ews have a much lower median value , 33 , but with a much broader distribution , with a peak close to 0 and a tail extending up to @xmath55 . since",
    "our model assumes that all galaxies have the same escape fraction for ly@xmath0 , this broad distribution of net ews results from the wide spread in values of dust extinction for the stellar continuum .",
    "the ly@xmath0 escape fraction reduces the net ew relative to the intrinsic value , but dust extinction of the stellar continuum increases it .",
    "the upper panel of fig.[fig : ew ] shows the median and 10 - 90 percentile range for the ew of ly@xmath0 as a function of the net ly@xmath0 flux . there is a weak trend of ew increasing with ly@xmath0 flux ( or luminosity ) . in the case of the intrinsic ew",
    ", this increase is driven mostly by the shift from being dominated by quiescently star - forming galaxies ( with a normal imf ) at low luminosities to being dominated by bursts ( with a top - heavy imf ) at high luminosities , and by the change in the typical star formation history . for the net ew , the increase in the median is driven also by the increase in the typical dust extinction of the stellar continuum with increasing luminosity .",
    "the ly@xmath0 equivalent widths predicted by our model are similar to those found in observed galaxy samples selected by their ly@xmath0 emission . @xcite and @xcite selected laes having ly@xmath0 fluxes @xmath56 at @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively . in both cases ,",
    "their narrow - band selection imposed a lower limit on the rest - frame ew @xmath59  for the detected objects , and the median rest - frame ew of the objects above this threshold was found to be @xmath60 .",
    "this appears broadly compatable with the predictions shown in fig.[fig : ew ] , once one allows for the fact that the ew threshold in the observed samples will raise the median ew above the value expected in the absence of any ew threshold . at a higher redshift , @xmath61 , @xcite selected laes with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and measured a median @xmath64for their sample .",
    "this is also in good agreement with our model , which predicts a median @xmath64  for laes with @xmath54 at this redshift .",

    "their sample is thus selected on rest - frame far - uv stellar continuum luminosity , rather than on the presence of a strong ly@xmath0 emission line .",
    "they find that @xmath65 of their galaxies show ly@xmath0 only in emission , @xmath65 of galaxies show ly@xmath0 only in absorption , and @xmath66 show a combination of ly@xmath0 absorption and emission .",
    "they find a very asymmetric and skewed distribution of ly@xmath0 rest - frame ew s , with a median close to 0 , extending down to @xmath67  for net absorption and to @xmath68  for net emission .",
    "for the galaxies with net ly@xmath0 emission , the median ew is @xmath69 .",
    "( for galaxies with net absorption , the median ew is @xmath70 . )",

    "the shape of the model ew distribution ( which is restricted to ew @xmath73 ) is also very similar to that found by @xcite for @xmath74 ( see their fig.8 ) .",
    "however , without including a calculation of ly@xmath0 absorption in our model , we can not make a more detailed comparison with @xcite .",
    "since a calculation of ly@xmath0 absorption requires a treatment of radiative transfer through the galaxy ism , we defer this to a future paper .",
    "since our model allows us to estimate ly@xmath0 ews , we can also estimate the effect on the ly@xmath0 luminosity function of imposing different lower limits on the ews of ly@xmath0 emission from galaxies .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : lf_ew ] , for rest - frame ew thresholds @xmath75 and @xmath76 , for redshifts @xmath8 and @xmath77 .",

    "there are two main reasons for the weak dependence of halo mass on ly@xmath0 luminosity at the lower redshifts : ( a ) the bursts introduce a large scatter into the relation between instantaneous sfr and object mass , especially at lower redshifts ; ( b ) the shift from being dominated by bursts at high ly@xmath0 luminosities to being dominated by quiescent disks at lower luminosities flattens the trend of sfr with ly@xmath0 luminosity , which tends to hide the underlying trend of halo mass with sfr .",

    "the halo masses of laes can be constrained observationally from measurements of their clustering .",

    "the issue of how photometric estimates of the stellar masses of high - redshift galaxies depend on the assumed imf is an important one , but is also complicated , because these estimates involve fitting multi - parameter models ( varying age , star formation history , metallicity and dust extinction ) to multi - band photometric data , in order to estimate the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar population .",

    "however , as noted earlier , there is an important caveat to our results : our model includes the attenuation of the stellar continuum light from galaxies due to ly@xmath0 scattering and lyc absorption by atomic hydrogen in the intervening igm , but we do not include any attenuation of the flux in the ly@xmath0 line due to ly@xmath0 scattering in the igm . at @xmath168 , when the igm is completely neutral , this attenuation of the ly@xmath0 line flux could potentially be very large , which would greatly decrease the number counts at a given flux .",
    "igm attenuation will therefore produce a trend in the number counts with @xmath50 in the opposite sense to the feedback of reionization on galaxy formation : at @xmath15 , the feedback effect tends to suppress the counts , but the igm attenuation will be removed , which will increase the counts relative to a model in which the igm is still neutral at that redshift .",

    "@xcite showed that for a galaxy at high redshift embedded in a neutral igm moving with the hubble flow , emitting a ly@xmath0 line centred at its rest - frame wavelength in the frame of the galaxy , scattering by atomic hydrogen in the igm would suppress the blue wing of the ly@xmath0 line completely ( reducing the line flux by a factor 2 ) , and also partly suppress the red wing due to the ly@xmath0 damping wings ( reducing the line flux even more ) .",

    "a more detailed theoretical analysis of the attenuation has been made by @xcite , who includes the following effects : ( i ) the intrinsic width of the ly@xmath0 line emitted by the galaxy , and the fact it may be redshifted in the galaxy rest - frame due to scattering in a galactic wind ; ( ii ) the non - uniform density profile of the igm around the galaxy and the departure of the velocity field from the hubble flow , due to cosmological infall onto the galaxy ; ( iii ) collisional ionization of the gas within the galaxy halo , photo - ionization of the surrounding igm by the stellar population , and clearing of bubbles in the igm by galactic winds .",

    "in this paper , we have used a detailed semi - analytical model of galaxy formation based on the @xmath1cdm cosmology to predict the properties of star - forming ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies over the redshift range @xmath187 .",
    "all except one of the parameters of the model were chosen without reference to the observed properties of ly@xmath0 emitters , having instead been chosen in previous work @xcite to match properties such as the uv , optical and ir luminosities , sizes , morphological types , gas fractions and metallicities of galaxies at low and high redshift .",
    "as shown in @xcite , our current model , which incorporates a top - heavy imf for stars formed in bursts triggered by galaxy mergers , provides a good match to the optical and far - ir luminosity functions in the local universe , the far - uv luminosity function of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath34 , and the number counts and redshifts of sub - mm galaxies .",
    "our assumption of a top - heavy imf in bursts receives support from studies of the metallicities of elliptical galaxies and intracluster gas @xcite .",
    "the one free parameter we had in the comparison of our model with observational data on ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) was the fraction @xmath26 of ly@xmath0 photons which escape from a galaxy . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath26 is a constant , irrespective of other galaxy properties . in our previous paper on laes @xcite",
    ", we found that @xmath27 reproduced the abundance of faint laes at @xmath188 , and we used the same value in the present paper .    in @xcite , we presented model predictions for the number counts of laes as a function of ly@xmath0 flux for the redshift range @xmath189 , but made only a very limited comparison with observational data , comparing only with the total counts at the limiting fluxes for different surveys . in this paper",
    ", we have made a much more detailed comparison of the model with observations , comparing predicted and observed ly@xmath0 luminosity functions over the range @xmath190 .",
    "the most important result of this paper is that , with our very simple assumption of a constant ly@xmath0 escape fraction , the model reproduces the observed luminosity functions , both in shape and in the evolution with redshift .",
    "we have also compared the predictions of our model with other observed properties of laes .",
    "we have made a comparison of predicted and observed ly@xmath0 equivalent widths ( ews ) .",
    "we find that the typical predicted ews are similar to those found in observational surveys , and that the predicted distribution of ews at a given ly@xmath0 flux is very broad once we include the effect of dust extinction , with a peak at 0 and a tail to large values .",
    "if we select galaxies in the model according to their continuum magnitudes rather than their ly@xmath0 fluxes , then we predict a distribution of ews which is similar to what has been found observationally for lyman - break galaxies at @xmath191 , when we restrict the comparison to galaxies where ly@xmath0 is seen in emission . we have compared predicted and observed broad - band magnitudes ( corresponding to rest - frame uv luminosities ) for galaxies selected by their ly@xmath0 fluxes , and find mostly good agreement .",
    "we have also compared the predicted sizes of laes with the limited existing observational data , and find reasonable consistency for the stellar half - light radii .",
    "we have also used our model to try to better understand the nature of the objects selected in ly@xmath0 emission - line surveys , and how they relate to other classes of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we have made predictions for the dark halo and stellar masses , the star formation rates and the gas metallicities for laes at different redshifts , properties which are physically fundamental , but for which we do not yet have direct observational measurements .",
    "the predicted halo masses imply values of the clustering bias which seem quite consistent with existing measurements of the large - scale clustering of laes .",
    "better observational characterization of the clustering of laes at different redshifts would provide a very important test of our model .",
    "finally , we have presented predictions for how many ly@xmath0 emitters should be seen at @xmath3 , a redshift range for which no laes have yet been found , but which is now opening up for observational study , thanks to advances in near - ir instrumentation . detection of laes in this redshift range would be very exciting both for probing the early stages of galaxy formation and the epoch of reionization .",
    "a problem for making predictions for laes at @xmath3 is that the redshift at which the igm reionized is uncertain , being observationally constrained to be in the range @xmath192 .",
    "this affects predictions for galaxies seen at @xmath193 , since the ly@xmath0 flux is expected to be significantly attenuated by propagation through a neutral igm , but by an uncertain amount which depends on many factors",
    ". we have made detailed predictions for how many objects could be seen using the dazle instrument , which begins operation soon , at @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "we find that , even if the attenuation by the igm is modest at these redshifts , then finding laes with dazle will require observation of a large number of fields",
    ".    the most important theoretical limitations of our present work are that it does not incorporate a detailed physical model for the escape of ly@xmath0 photons from galaxies , and that we do not include a treatment of the attenuation of ly@xmath0 fluxes by the igm prior to reionization .",
    "we plan to address these issues in future papers .",
