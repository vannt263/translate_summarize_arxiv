    "in the past decade and a half , over two hundred and fifty extra - solar planets have been discovered . with the data expected to be produced by satellites such as corot @xcite and kepler @xcite",
    ", it will not only be possible to find smaller planets , but moons of those planets as well @xcite . as a result",
    ", the detectability of extra - solar moons is starting to be explored in terms of their effect on planetary microlensing @xcite and transit lightcurves @xcite .",
    "upper limits have already been placed on the mass and radius of putative moons of the planets hd  209458  b @xcite , ogle - tr-113 b @xcite and hd  189733  b @xcite .    while the limitations of microlensing and the transit technique for detecting moons have been discussed and used in the literature , the limitations of other techniques such as the time - of - arrival ( toa ) technique have not .",
    "this technique involves determining the variations in line - of - sight position to the host star , usually a pulsar , using the observed time of periodic events associated with that host .",
    "the aim of this analysis is to explore exactly what the toa signal of a planet - moon pair is , and relate it to the planetary systems that can give the most precise timing information , the systems around millisecond pulsars .",
    "the first planetary system outside the solar system was detected around the millisecond pulsar psr  1257 + 12 @xcite .",
    "this detection was made by investigating periodic variations in the time of arrival of its radio pulses using a timing model .",
    "an example timing model for the case in which the planet s orbit around the pulsar is circular is : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the times at which the initial and @xmath16 pulses are emitted in the pulsar s frame , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the times the initial and @xmath16 pulses are received in the observatory s frame , and the term @xmath19 acts to change the frame of reference from the observatory on earth to the barycenter of the pulsar system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more complete discussion of the components of @xmath20 ) .",
    "the final term represents the effect of a planet on the motion of the pulsar , where @xmath9 is the planet - pulsar distance , @xmath10 is the angle between the normal of the planet - pulsar orbit and the line - of - sight and @xmath21 is the initial angular position of the planet measured from the @xmath22-axis , about the system barycenter . in addition , @xmath23 and @xmath6 are the mass of the pulsar and the planet , respectively .",
    "currently , four planets around two millisecond pulsars have been discovered , three around psr  1257 + 12 @xcite and one around psr  b1620 - 26 @xcite .",
    "these four planets include one with mass @xmath24 earth masses , the lowest mass extra - solar planet known .",
    "this low - mass detection threshold , in addition to measurements of orbital perturbations ( e.g. , the 2:3 orbital resonance between psr  1257 + 12c and psr  1257 + 12d , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , demonstrate the sensitivity of the toa technique .",
    "indeed , as a result of their high rotation rate ( and thus large number of sampled pulses ) and low level of noise activity , millisecond pulsars make optimal targets for high precision toa work ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to investigate the perturbation caused by planet - moon binarity , the timing model presented in equation  ( [ toa_example ] ) must be updated to include effects due to the presence of the moon . for simplicity , we consider here only systems in which both the orbit of the planet and moon around their common barycenter , and the orbit of the planet - moon barycenter around the pulsar , are both circular and lie in the same plane .",
    "an example model taking this assumption into account is : @xmath25 we have explicitly modified @xmath26 to indicate that it depends on the combined planet - moon mass , and included another term , @xmath27 , to account for planet - moon binarity . here",
    "@xmath7 is the mass of the moon , @xmath8 is the distance between the planet and the moon , and @xmath28 is the initial angular position of the planet measured from the planet - moon barycenter .",
    "the quantities @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are shown in figure [ coordsystem ] .",
    "the functional form of @xmath27 can be derived from @xmath31 , the vector between the system barycenter and the pulsar , using : @xmath32 where @xmath11 is the speed of light and @xmath33 is a unit vector pointing along the line of sight , the only direction along which quantities can be measured .",
    "the governing equation for @xmath34 can be written as the sum of the zeroth order term , which describes @xmath26 , and the tidal terms , which describe @xmath27 : @xmath35,\\label{toa - d2rs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the tidal terms have been collected into square brackets and noting that @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and where the vectors @xmath31 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are also shown in figure [ coordsystem ] . using the coordinate system in figure [ coordsystem ]",
    ", it can be seen after some algebra that : @xmath43\\mathbf{i }   + \\left[r\\sin \\phi_b - \\frac{m_p}{m_p+m_m}r \\sin \\phi_p \\right]\\mathbf{j}\\\\ \\label{toa - vec - rp } \\mathbf{r } + \\mathbf{r}_p & = & \\left[r\\cos \\phi_b + \\frac{m_m}{m_p+m_m}r \\cos \\phi_p\\right]\\mathbf{i }   + \\left[r \\sin \\phi_b + \\frac{m_m}{m_p+m_m}r \\sin \\phi_p \\right]\\mathbf{j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are defined in figure [ coordsystem ] , and @xmath44 is the direction to the line - of - sight , projected onto the plane of the orbit",
    ".    as the orbits are both circular and coplanar , we have that @xmath46 , and @xmath47 where @xmath3 and @xmath2 are the constant mean motions of the two respective orbits . substituting equations",
    "( [ toa - vec - rm ] ) and ( [ toa - vec - rp ] ) into the coefficients of the last two terms of equation  ( [ toa - d2rs ] ) , assuming @xmath48 and using the binomial expansion to order @xmath49 gives : @xmath50 \\label{toa - expnd - ms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath51\\label{toa - expnd - ps}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting equations  ( [ toa - vec - rm ] ) , ( [ toa - vec - rp ] ) , ( [ toa - expnd - ms ] ) and ( [ toa - expnd - ps ] ) into ( [ toa - d2rs ] ) gives , after simplification : @xmath52 .\\label{toa - d2rs2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from figure  [ coordsystem ] it can be seen that : @xmath53 substituting equations  ( [ toa - d2rs2 ] ) and ( [ toa - ndef ] ) into equation  ( [ toa - toapertpmdef ] ) , gives : @xmath54 .\\label{toa - pert1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath55 term in equation  ( [ toa - pert1 ] ) has the same frequency as the signal of a lone planet and it can be shown that it acts to increase the measured value of @xmath56 derived from @xmath26 by @xmath57 . consequently , this term can be neglected as it will be undetectable as a separate signal .",
    "also , the edge of the stability region for a prograde satellite of the low - mass component of a high - mass binary can be approximated by @xmath58 for the case of circular orbits , where @xmath59^{1/3}$ ] is the secondary s hill radius @xcite .",
    "when @xmath8 is equal to this maximum stable radius @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath61 is likely , we have that the denominators of the @xmath62 and @xmath63 terms will never approach zero .",
    "this , in addition to the assumption of zero eccentricities , means that resonance effects can be neglected .",
    "consequently , equation  ( [ toa - pert1 ] ) can be simplified by neglecting @xmath3 in the denominators , giving : @xmath64 .\\label{toa - pert2}\\ ] ] writing @xmath2 in terms of @xmath8 , using kepler s law , gives : @xmath65 .\\label{toa - pert}\\ ] ]    from equation  ( [ toa - pert ] ) , we have that the size of the perturbation varies as @xmath66[r / r]^5 $ ] times the system crossing time , @xmath5 .",
    "so , the best hope of a detectable signal occurs when the planet - moon pair are close to the parent pulsar , widely separated from each other , both quite massive , and very accurate timing data is available .",
    "our result is consistent with a similar study done by @xcite , who calculated the radial velocity perturbation on one component of a binary star system for the case in which the other component was an unresolved pair . converting their radial velocity perturbation to a timing perturbation , setting the mass of the planet and moon equal to each other , as in the case investigated by @xcite , and noting that @xmath8 in this work is equivalent to their @xmath67 , our formula and that of @xcite agree .",
    "to investigate whether or not it is possible to detect moons of pulsar planets , we simplify equation  ( [ toa - pert ] ) by summing the amplitudes of the sinusoids , giving the maximum possible amplitude : @xmath68 thus , for a given @xmath69 , the maximum amplitude increases linearly with @xmath9 .",
    "so , for planet - moon pairs that are far from each other and their parent pulsar , detection may be possible .",
    "for example , a 0.1au jupiter - jupiter binary located 5.2au from a host pulsar would produce a @xmath27 of amplitude 960ns , which compares well with the 130ns residuals obtained from one of the most stable millisecond pulsars , psr j0437 - 4715 @xcite .    to demonstrate this method ,",
    "the expected maximum signals from a moon orbiting each of the four known pulsar planets was explored .",
    "it was found that in the case of psr  b1620 - 26  b , signals that are in principle detectable could confirm or rule out certain configurations of moon mass and orbital parameters ( see figure  [ pulsarplanetmoon ] ) .    in the particular case of psr  b1620 - 26  b",
    ", the perturbation signal will not exactly match the signal shown in equation  ( [ toa - pert ] ) due to the effect of its white dwarf companion .",
    "the effect of this companion was investigated as a side project and it was found that its effect was to introduce additional perturbations on top of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 calculated . consequently , the detection threshold represents an upper limit to the minimum detectable signal and thus the analysis is still valid .    .",
    "the mass of the host was set at 1.7 solar masses ( the sum of the mass of the pulsar and its white dwarf companion ) .",
    "the @xmath70 detection threshold was calculated assuming the @xmath71 timing residuals given in @xcite are uncorrelated and that similar accuracy toa measurements of psr  b1620 - 26 continue to the present day .",
    "the stability region was estimated as 0.36 times the hill sphere of the planet .",
    ", width=368,height=288 ]    unfortunately , there are practical limits to the applicability of this method .",
    "they include discounting other systems that could produce similar signals , sensitivity limits due to intrinsic pulsar timing noise , and limits imposed by moon formation and stability .    first , other systems that could produce similar signals need to be investigated .",
    "possible processes include pulsar precession ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , periodic variation in the ism @xcite , gravitational waves @xcite , unmodelled interactions between planets @xcite and other small planets . to help investigate the last two options",
    ", we plan on completing a more in - depth analysis of the perturbation signal of an extra - solar moon , including the effects of orbital inclination and orbital eccentricity .",
    "second , the noise floor of the system needs to be examined .",
    "the suitability of pulsars for signal detection is limited by two main noise sources , phase jitter and red timing noise ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "phase jitter is error due to pulse - to - pulse variations and leads to statistically independent errors for each toa measurement .",
    "phase jitter decreases with increasing rotation rate ( decreasing @xmath72 ) due to the resultant increase in the number of pulses sampled each integration .",
    "red timing noise refers to noise for which neigbouring toa residuals are correlated .",
    "red timing noise has been historically modeled as a random walk in phase , frequency or frequency derivative ( for example , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "red noise is strongly dependent on @xmath73 .",
    "this relationship can be understood from the theoretical standpoint that red noise is due to non - homogeneous angular momentum transport either between components within the pulsar ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or between it and its environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to illustrate the effect of these two noise sources on toa accuracy ,",
    "an estimate of their combined residuals as a function of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is shown in figure  [ pulsarplot ] .",
    "for comparison , the values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 of every pulsar as of publication are also included .",
    "the atnf pulsar catalogue @xcite was used to provide the pulsar data for this plot .",
    "third , whether or not moons will be discovered depends on whether or not they _ exist _ in certain configurations , which depends on their formation history and orbital stability .",
    "recent research suggests that there are physical mass limits for satellites of both gas giants @xcite and terrestrial planets @xcite .",
    "also , tidal and three - body effects can strongly affect the longevity of moons @xcite .",
    "finally , while this method was investigated for the specific case of a pulsar host , this technique could also be applied to planets orbiting other clock - like hosts such as pulsating giant stars @xcite and white dwarfs @xcite .",
