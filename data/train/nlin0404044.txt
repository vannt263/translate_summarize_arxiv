    "the dynamics of waves in chains of coupled oscillators is the key to understanding the motion of defects in many physical and biological problems : motion of dislocations @xcite or cracks @xcite in crystalline materials , atoms adsorbed on a periodic substrate @xcite , motion of electric field domains and domain walls in semiconductor superlattices @xcite , pulse propagation through myelinated nerves @xcite or cardiac cells @xcite ... a peculiar feature of these spatially discrete systems is that wave fronts and pulses get pinned for entire intervals of a control parameter such as an external force .",
    "typically , wave fronts do not move unless the external force surpasses a control value .",
    "such is the case with the static and dynamic peierls stresses in dislocation dynamics @xcite or the dynamic and static friction coefficients @xcite in continuum mechanics .",
    "pinning and motion of wave fronts also explain the relocation of static electric field domains and the self - oscillations of the current in semiconductor superlattices @xcite .",
    "wave front motion in systems of nonlinear oscillators modeling these phenomena are easier to analyze in the overdamped case , and less so if inertia is important . in the presence of inertia , the wrong choice of boundary conditions or the numerical method may suppress important solutions of the original system or yield spurious oscillations .",
    "thus two problems that are important in all spatially discrete systems acquire even more importance : how do we find wave fronts ? and",
    ", what are their stability properties ?",
    "we have solved the first problem in a recent work @xcite by choosing a damped system of oscillators with a piecewise linear source term , see also @xcite .",
    "our results show explicitly the existence of kinks with oscillatory profiles for systems with little or no damping . in the latter case ,",
    "these wave fronts have at least one tail with non decaying oscillations that extend to infinity .",
    "depending on the control parameter , branches of oscillatory wave fronts may exist , coexisting for entire intervals of the external force and even coexisting with pinned wave front solutions .",
    "these facts , long - lived oscillatory profiles and coexistence of wave front branches , highlight the importance of ascertaining the stability properties of these solutions .",
    "this is not easy and not many results are known .    to be precise ,",
    "let us consider oscillator chain : @xmath0 we nondimensionalize the model by choosing the time scale @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the interatomic distance , @xmath3 is the mass and @xmath4 the strength of the on - site potential . for a piecewise parabolic potential ,",
    "the nondimensional equation is : @xmath5 here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the ratios between friction and inertial forces , and between the strengths of the harmonic and on - site potentials , respectively . @xmath8 .",
    "atkinson and cabrera @xcite conjectured that only two branches of kinks are stable for ( [ e1])-([e2 ] ) :    * a branch of static kinks for values of the control parameter @xmath9 below an static threshold @xmath10 * a branch of traveling kinks for @xmath9 above a dynamic threshold @xmath11 , with speeds @xmath12 larger than a minimum speed @xmath13 .",
    "this family has a distinctive feature compared to eventual slower waves @xcite : the leading edge of the kink is monotone whereas the trailing edge may develop oscillations .",
    "the values @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to the static and dynamic peierls stresses of the literature on dislocations @xcite . in the overdamped limit @xmath16 , @xmath17 and stable wave fronts can be found with arbitrarily small speeds @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we checked numerically the validity of atkinson and cabrera s conjecture .",
    "this is a delicate affair and further analytical work is clearly desirable .",
    "in fact , most numerical studies of kink propagation truncate the infinite chain to a finite chain , fix some boundary conditions and then use a runge - kutta solver ( or variants ) to investigate the dynamics of kink - like initial configurations .",
    "for instance , peyrard and kruskal @xcite applied this procedure to study kinks in the conservative frenkel - kontorova model , including friction near the ends of the truncated chain in an attempt to avoid reflections .",
    "on the other hand , our analytical work @xcite shows that traveling kinks oscillate with almost uniform amplitude even for small damping .",
    "then , artificial boundary conditions and time discretization may greatly distort their shape and dynamics .",
    "in fact , using runge - kutta methods to solve equation ( [ e1 ] ) with constant boundary conditions generates reflections at the boundary , as shown in figure [ figura0 ] , after a waiting time depending on the size of the lattice .",
    "such oscillations end up distorting the right tail and may completely alter the shape of the kink giving rise to a complex oscillatory pattern .",
    "a good way to avoid the spurious effects of inappropiate boundary conditions is to recast ( [ e1 ] ) as an integral equation .",
    "integral reformulations provide an analytical expression for the solutions of ( [ e1 ] ) which we use to develop new numerical algorithms .",
    "spurious pinning and spurious oscillations are suppressed .",
    "the introduction of these numerical methods based on integral reformulations of ( [ e1 ] ) is one of our main results .",
    "the main analytical results of this paper concern the nonlinear stability of stationary and traveling wave fronts in chains of oscillators . besides leading to good numerical methods",
    ", we have also used the integral equation formulation to investigate the nonlinear stability of wave front patterns .",
    "we provide a criterion to decide whether certain kink - like initial configurations evolve into stable wave front patterns . in discrete overdamped models",
    "the nonlinear stability of traveling wave fronts follows from comparison principles .",
    "this strategy was applied to the study of domain walls in discrete drift - diffusion models for semiconductor superlattices in @xcite .",
    "common belief is that comparison principles do not hold in models with inertia .",
    "this belief is wrong .",
    "how can we asses the stability of traveling wave fronts in such models ?",
    "for large damping , we can directly compare solutions of ( [ e1 ] ) using its equivalent formulation as an integral equation thanks to the positivity of the green functions . as the damping decreases",
    ", we can ignore the oscillatory tails of the fronts and compare the monotone leading edges of the solutions , which drive their motion .",
    "the process of comparing solutions is technically more complex than in the overdamped case because the green functions change sign , and the fronts have oscillatory wakes .",
    "summarizing , there are two key ingredients for stability .",
    "first , the leading edges of the fronts have to be monotone .",
    "second , the green functions of the linear problem must be positive for an initial time interval , of duration comparable to the time the front needs to advance one position .",
    "this restricts the possible values of the propagation speed for small damping : only fast kinks are shown to be stable .",
    "our methods are quite general and can be extended to frenkel - kontorova models with smooth sources @xcite at the cost of technical complications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce a numerical algorithm and discuss the stability of static kinks . the stability theory for traveling kinks",
    "is presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the role of oscillating green functions in the appearance of static and dynamic thresholds due to coexistence of stable static and traveling waves . in section 5 we briefly comment on extensions to oscillator chains with smooth cubic sources .",
    "section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "basic details on the pertinent green functions are recalled in appendices a and b. proofs of our main stability results can be found in appendices c and d.     computed by solving a truncated system of differential equations ( dashed ) and by integral expressions ( solid ) for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
