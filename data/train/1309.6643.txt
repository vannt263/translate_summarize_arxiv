    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are the largest ( @xmath5 kpc ) and most massive ( @xmath6 ) galaxies in the universe . a number of early studies at lower redshift (",
    "@xmath1 , e.g. @xcite ) have reported a largely homogeneous set of properties for these galaxies .",
    "such galaxies are typically located at the center of the cluster potential well , exhibit early type morphologies , sometimes with a large halo , and contain old stellar populations .",
    "early formation and evolution theories of these galaxies , such as galactic cannibalism ( e.g. @xcite ) , cooling flows ( e.g. @xcite ) , tidal stripping ( e.g. @xcite ) , or rapid merging of galaxies during cluster collapse ( e.g. @xcite ) were proposed . at present ,",
    "the hierarchical structure formation scenario is widely accepted .",
    "@xcite used the millenium run simulation @xcite to show that bcgs could be formed simply through a combination of major and minor merging .",
    "this simulation reproduced the color evolution consistent with a passively evolving stellar population formed at high redshift ( @xmath72 - 5 ) .",
    "however , new works have reported cases where bcgs possess bluer stellar populations than the typical red galaxies in the cluster and , in addition , are sometimes observed with high star formation rates @xcite . while efforts have been made to improve simulations to account for these observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the main mechanisms needed to produce these properties are not fully understood .",
    "complementarily , a vast number of results have been published in the last decade about the size increase in massive ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which a size increase of a factor of @xmath8 is observed from redshifts @xmath9 to the present day .",
    "other works have measured the size evolution only in bcgs , and found larger rates of increase compared to z@xmath10 bcgs ( e.g. , @xmath11 from @xmath12 , @xcite ; @xmath13 from @xmath14 , @xcite ; @xmath11 from @xmath15 , @xcite ) .",
    "different mechanisms have been suggested from numerical simulations @xcite and from observations to explain these size increases , such as major / minor mergers @xcite or adiabatic expansion @xcite . in a recent study of 160 bcgs spanning a large range in redshift ( @xmath16 )",
    ", @xcite found that bcgs increase in stellar mass considerably from @xmath17 to the present day , appealing to major dry merging as the primary transformative mechanism .",
    "as such , the picture is far from complete , and the conditions that arise in cluster environments which allow such mechanisms to be efficient , as well as the epoch in which these mechanisms are most instrumental in transforming bcgs / mmcgs in clusters , is still far from understood .    in this paper",
    "we compare the bcgs / mmcgs in the constituent clusters and groups of the cl1604 supercluster @xcite at @xmath0 to a matched sample of bcgs / mmcgs drawn from local clusters with similar spectroscopic coverage and photometric data .",
    "we observe striking differences between the high- and low - redshift samples with respect to the bcg / mmcg morphology , color , spectral properties , and luminosity gaps .",
    "using the 531 spectroscopically confirmed members of the cl1604 supercluster we investigate the amount of stellar mass surrounding the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs and contrast this to that of the low - redshift clusters .",
    "these comparisons , in conjunction with comparisons of our observational results to semi - analytic models and numerical simulations , allow us to isolate the mechanisms responsible for the growth of stellar mass and size of bcgs / mmcgs from @xmath0 to the present day .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the observational datasets used in this paper along with the method used to derive secondary parameters from the photometry .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analysis of the bcg / mmcg properties , such as the cluster stellar mass distribution , the color - magnitude diagram of the parent clusters / groups , and the color , size , spectral , and morphological evolution of the bcgs / mmcgs in our samples . in section 4 ,",
    "we compare and contrast our results against the backdrop of simulations and discuss the implications of our results .",
    "section 5 contains the final conclusions of the paper . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath18=70 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 , @xmath20 = 0.27 , @xmath21=0.73 .",
    "all magnitudes are given in the ab system @xcite and all equivalent width measurements are presented in the rest - frame .",
    "in this work , we consider the bcgs and mmcgs of the @xmath0 cl1604 supercluster , which contains clusters and groups that span a wide range in halo mass , and a comparison sample of comparable clusters at low - redshift ( @xmath1 ) observed as part of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . in this section",
    "we describe the characteristics of both samples as well as the observational datasets available for each .",
    "the cl1604 supercluster , located at @xmath0 , is one of the most well - characterized superclusters in the high - redshift universe . as part of the observations of redshift evolution in large scale environment survey ( orelse ; @xcite ) , the galaxy populations of both the constituent clusters and groups of the cl1604 supercluster as well as that of the intermediate density environments connecting the various structures have been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "the galaxies that comprise the cl1604 complex reside in a large range of environments that span from massive , virialized clusters to small groups and chains of starbursting and active galaxies located in environments with densities comparable to that of typical field galaxies at @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , the clusters and groups housed in the supercluster have markedly different properties , ranging in velocity dispersion from @xmath22 km @xmath23 and exhibiting a large variety of evolutionary states ( see @xcite ) . as such",
    ", the cl1604 supercluster is an ideal structure to investigate the transformation of massive cluster and group galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the wealth of observations available for the cl1604 supercluster have been described in depth elsewhere ( @xcite ) . as such",
    ", we only briefly summarize here those observations which are utilized in this study .",
    "ground - based imaging in six bands ( @xmath24 ) was obtained on the entire cl1604 field with a variety of different telescopes ( subaru , palomar hale 5-m , & ukirt ) . accompanying deep _",
    "spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) imaging was obtained in four bands ( 3.6/4.5/5.8/8.0@xmath25 m ) .",
    "this 10-band imaging was primarily used in this study to calculate stellar masses for the cl1604 member from the center of a given cluster / group and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion measured for that cluster / group .",
    "this is different than a cl1604 member galaxy , referred to here , which is defined simply as a galaxy within the redshift range @xmath28 . ]",
    "galaxies , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we adopt the r.m.s .",
    "difference between masses derived from our sed - fitting process and those derived using our @xmath29-band imaging ( 0.23 dex ) as an estimate of the uncertainty in our stellar masses .",
    "while this underestimates systematic uncertainties resulting from our choice of stellar templates , @xmath30 ratios , and initial mass function ( imf ) , these uncertainties are of little interest for this study as the mass comparisons made for cl1604 galaxies are relative and the conclusions drawn from these comparisons are unaffected by the mass `` zero point '' .",
    "this will also be true when we compare the cl1604 galaxies to those selected by sdss at low - redshift , as the mass fitting process for the sdss galaxies is similar to the one chosen for the cl1604 galaxies .",
    "the primary datasets of interest for this paper are the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; @xcite ) imaging and the comprehensive keck i / ii spectroscopic campaign undertaken in the cl1604 field .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "data consist of a 17-pointing mosaic in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands , covering a large fraction of the constituent members and reaching 5@xmath33 point source completeness limits of 27.2 & 26.8 mags , respectively , in the shallowest regions . through the combination of the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; @xcite ) and the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; @xcite ) on the keck i / ii telescopes , nearly 2500 spectra",
    "have been obtained in the field , resulting in the spectroscopic confirmation of 531 member galaxies ( for details see @xcite ) . in the vicinity of the cl1604 clusters and groups ( @xmath34 )",
    "the spectroscopic data are roughly complete to a limit of @xmath35 for red - sequence galaxies , corresponding to a rest - frame limit of @xmath36-correcting the observed - frame @xmath32 band at @xmath37 to the rest - frame @xmath38 band using a 5 gyr old elliptical template from @xcite , broadly appropriate for our red - sequence galaxies .",
    "no evolutionary @xmath39-correction was applied . ] .    for each cluster or group",
    "the bcg was selected as the member galaxy with the brightest @xmath32 magnitude within @xmath40 mpc of the luminosity - weighted cluster / group center ( see  [ clustermass ] for a definition of this center ) . in principle , selecting a bcg in the @xmath29 band rather than the @xmath32 band is preferable , as the latter can be sensitive to star - formation processes at these redshifts , which may lead to biases in the bcg selection . however , because of the drastic difference in precision between our _ hst _ acs imaging and that of our ukirt @xmath29-band imaging and in order to be consistent with the method used to select bcgs at low - redshift , we chose to exclusively rely on @xmath32 magnitudes to select the bcg . in practice , for six of the eight groups and clusters in cl1604 , the bcg selected in the @xmath32 band is either identical or consistent within the photometric errors to the bcg selected in the @xmath29 band .",
    "in addition , we trivialize issues related to the selection of bcgs in different bands by including mmcgs , whose stellar masses are estimated through the sed - fitting process or @xmath41-band imaging as explained below , in both the low - redshift and high - redshift samples .",
    "we therefore ignore any such biases for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the mmcgs for the cl1604 clusters and groups were selected in a nearly identical manner as the bcgs , with the obvious exception that the stellar mass derived through sed - fitting process or through the @xmath29-band imaging was used in place of the @xmath32 magnitude ( for more details on how stellar masses for cl1604 member galaxies were determined see @xcite ) .",
    "because the stellar masses derived for the cl1604 member galaxies are considerably less precise than the @xmath32 magnitudes used to select bcgs , there existed a few cases where several galaxies in the cluster / group had stellar masses consistent within the errors of the measured mmcg . to mitigate this ambiguity , in all cases galaxies with stellar masses within @xmath42 of that of the galaxy with the highest measured mass",
    "were also selected and our analysis was repeated for each potential mmcg ( setting a maximum of three mmcg  candidates \" for each cluster / group ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : sc1604radec ] we show the full extent of the cl1604 supercluster complex along with the spatial location of all bcgs and mmcg candidates selected in this section .    while the galaxies of the cl1604 structure constitute the whole of our high - redshift comparison sample in this study , it is essential to emphasize here that the supercluster is comprised of hundreds of member galaxies that are situated in a large variety of environments .",
    "the constituent clusters and groups are spread in such a way throughout the supercluster that they are not currently ( at @xmath0 ) experiencing major interactions between each other ( see , e.g. , figures 11 & 12 in @xcite ) .",
    "as such , for the study presented here , the eight clusters and groups of the cl1604 supercluster can essentially be considered as isolated and independent structures at @xmath0 .",
    "a complication seemingly arises when comparing these clusters and groups to lower redshift isolated clusters . by virtue of the lss in which they reside",
    ", both the global and local conditions of clusters and groups could vary appreciably over the course of their lifetime relative to those of isolated clusters at @xmath43 .",
    "however , given the uncertain dynamics and evolution of the supercluster and the large line - of - sight and projected distances between the cl1604 clusters and groups , distances which are likely large enough to prevent major interactions by @xmath43 , we ignore any complication of the lss to the evolution of the galaxy populations of the cl1604 clusters and groups and instead treat them in this study as isolated structures .",
    "many subtleties exist when attempting to compare bcgs / mmcgs at high - redshift to those at low - redshift ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "astrophysical biases , such as those that arise due to the relationship between bcg properties and the mass of the host cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ) , must be carefully accounted for in order to make valid comparisons .",
    "additionally , biases can be induced by comparing inhomogenous datasets or by making inhomogenous selections .",
    "incomplete spectroscopy , morphological comparisons using bands that probe significantly different ( rest - frame ) wavelength regimes , and differences in cluster selection methods all have non - trivial effects on the comparisons made in this study . as such",
    ", we require a low - redshift sample that both astrophysically and observationally mimics the constituent clusters and groups of the cl1604 supercluster .",
    "to this end we drew a sample of low - redshift clusters from the meta - catalog of the compiled properties of x - ray detected galaxy clusters ( mcxc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the clusters contained within this catalog fulfilled several criteria important to this study . first , the catalog draws on all public data available at the time of publishing , which results in a large number of galaxy clusters .",
    "this is important because , while we will make an attempt later in this paper to evolve the cl1604 clusters / groups to the present day ( see  [ clustermass ] ) , there is much uncertainty involved in this process .",
    "having a larger sample at low - redshift allows us to explore a larger range of physical properties and masses of the `` descendant '' clusters with which to compare the cl1604 clusters and groups .",
    "another virtue of this catalog is its overlap with the sdss .",
    "this is a tremendous virtue , as it allows access to an enormous dataset of well - calibrated and internally consistent multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "such an overlap allows us to select galaxy clusters with both @xmath38-band imaging ( the @xmath38 band having roughly equivalent rest - frame coverage at @xmath1 to the @xmath32 band at @xmath0 ) and magnitude - limited spectroscopy of potential cluster members .",
    "the depth of the sdss imaging slightly exceeds the depth of the acs imaging in the cl1604 cluster ( in units of @xmath44 ) , important so that we are able to observe low ( inherent ) surface brightness features in galaxies at low-@xmath45 and high-@xmath45 ( see  [ morphevo ] for a detailed discussion on this issue ) .",
    "a final virtue of the mcxc catalog is the well - defined and homogeneously measured x - ray luminosities of all mcxc clusters .",
    "cross - correlating these x - ray detections with overdensities of galaxies in the sdss ensures a high level of purity in our sample , i.e. , that each x - ray detection is truly associated with a galaxy cluster . for the comparisons made in this paper , we do not require an extremely large sample of low - redshift galaxy clusters , but rather a sample which spans completely the properties of the potential descendants of the cl1604 clusters and groups .",
    "as will be shown later , the clusters selected from the mcxc catalog fulfill these requirements , and thus we value purity over completeness . additionally , because each cluster in the mcxc catalog has , by definition , a hot intracluster medium ( icm ) , the level of virialization in each mcxc can be , in concert with sdss spectroscopy , directly probed . in appendix",
    "a we discuss the importance of this particular aspect of the mcxc catalog and the consequences for our results .",
    "the process of selecting a sample of galaxy clusters from the mcxc catalog was as follows .",
    "galaxy clusters which appeared in the mcxc catalog were cross - referenced with the sdss dr8 public database to look for overlap . for those clusters which fell within the sdss footprint we required that any potential comparison cluster have @xmath46 imaging in the @xmath38 band to sufficient depth to make valid morphological comparisons ( @xmath47 mag / arcsec@xmath48 ) , @xmath49 sufficient photometry to estimate stellar masses ( i.e. , measured magnitudes in all sdss bands ) , @xmath50 spectroscopy of at least 80% of potential member galaxies brighter than @xmath51-corrected to @xmath52 in a similar fashion to the cl1604 galaxies in the previous section . ]",
    "that lie within a projected distance of @xmath53 mpc from the cluster center , and @xmath54 spectroscopy of the 10 brightest objects in the @xmath38 band within a projected distance of @xmath53 mpc from the cluster center as defined by the mcxc x - ray centroid . imposing these criteria resulted in a sample of 100 low - redshift clusters out of the 1743 clusters contained within the mcxc catalog . a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the members of each of the 100 clusters",
    "was inspected visually .",
    "those clusters that did not have well - defined red sequence such that the presence of a galaxy cluster could not be confirmed ( only two clusters ) , had more than one red sequence ( i.e. , projected with another cluster ) , clusters with questionable velocity dispersions ( see  [ clustermass ] ) , or clusters for which the brightest cluster galaxy was in some way ambiguous were rejected .",
    "these cuts resulted in a final sample of 81 clusters with a median redshift of @xmath55 and a redshift range of @xmath56 .",
    "the bcg for each cluster was selected in a manner identical to that of the cl1604 bcgs , with the selection being performed in the @xmath38 band .",
    " total \" stellar masses for all sdss galaxies were taken from sdss dr7 , determined in a method similar to that of @xcite . as was the case for the cl1604 members ,",
    "the fitting used for sdss dr7 employed stellar population synthesis models from @xcite employing a @xcite imf .",
    "the mmcg for each cluster was selected as the most massive member galaxy within @xmath53 mpc of the x - ray cluster center .",
    "however , it was not possible to definitively determine a mmcg in all of the mcxc clusters .",
    "of the 81 clusters in our final sample , 21 contained galaxies whose @xmath57 magnitudes rivaled that of the bcg that went untargeted in sdss , but which had redshifts consistent with their parent cluster from various literature .",
    "in such cases , the sdss routine was not used to fit a stellar mass , and while the bcg could still be definitively determined , we could generally not determine a mmcg .",
    "exceptions were made for those few clusters where the @xmath57 magnitude of the bcg exceeded the brightness of any galaxy untargeted by sdss by greater than 1.5 magnitudes . for the remaining 60 clusters where a mmcg could be definitively determined , only 13 had a bcg that differed from the mmcg . in the remaining 47 clusters the @xmath38-band selection was effective at isolating the mmcg . in figure",
    "[ fig : sdssradec ] we show the spatial positions of the bcgs and mmcgs selected for all mcxc clusters .    one final discussion is necessary on the nature of the structures studied in the mcxc and cl1604 samples . as we will show in the next section , the structures that have been selected span a wide range in line - of - sight velocity dispersions and virial masses for both samples",
    "this is potentially problematic , as it is well known that different processes have different effects in clusters which are in different dynamical states ( e.g. , @xcite ) and , furthermore , that galaxies embedded in group systems experience certain processes more frequently than do their cluster counterparts ( e.g. , @xcite ) . during the presentation of our analysis , where relevant , we will match the mcxc and cl1604 host structures in virial mass , such that the bcgs / mmcgs of the two samples can be compared , on average , fairly .",
    "however , the question still remains as to what term to use to refer to the mcxc structures .",
    "in general , the dividing line between clusters and groups is fairly arbitrary . in principle",
    ", the delineation point is set primarily using the criterion that the latter have galaxy velocity dispersions that are roughly comparable to the velocity dispersion of stars in an individual galaxy .",
    "this is done so that galaxy - galaxy merging is , by definition , efficient in  group environments \" and inefficient in  cluster environments \" . in practice",
    ", groups are defined using a wide variety of galaxy velocity dispersions , dispersions which in many cases exceed the stellar dispersions of even the most massive galaxies . for the cl1604 supercluster",
    ", we adopt a commonly used threshold of 600 km s@xmath19 @xcite , which allows us to define the constituent structures of the supercluster in a consistent manner with previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a choice is , however , for this study purely a pedagogical one and does not have an effect on any of our results . though we will show in the next section that some of the mcxc structures have line - of - sight velocity dispersions below this dividing line",
    ", we will continue to refer to the mcxc structures simply as ",
    "clusters \" throughout the paper for the sake of brevity , noting again that this choice has no effect on our results .     mpc . by construction",
    "this is the largest possible distance a bcg / mmcg can be from the x - ray center of its parent cluster .",
    "in contrast to the bcgs / mmcgs of the cl1604 supercluster , the bcgs and mmcgs of the low - redshift mcxc / sdss sample appear largely at the center of the cluster potential well , though there are a few obvious exceptions . ]",
    "as noted in the previous section , galaxy clusters which were selected from the mcxc catalog contained a large number of spectroscopically confirmed members from sdss .",
    "the median number of spectroscopically confirmed members in the mcxc clusters was 36 , ranging from 11 in the sparsest cases ( @xmath58 of the clusters ) to greater than 325 members in the richest cases .",
    "these clusters were also supplemented with additional redshifts from the literature . with this number of members",
    "it is feasible , in principle , to calculate line - of - sight velocity dispersions , @xmath59 , for each cluster , which could then be used in turn as a mass proxy .",
    "though the velocity dispersions measured for the most sparsely sampled clusters will be of questionable accuracy ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , especially in those cases where only the brightest galaxies are sampled , the large mcxc / sdss sample employed here mitigates a poorly sampled velocity dispersion for any given cluster .",
    "while cluster masses can also be derived through the x - ray quantities , a typical method used to derived total cluster mass relies on the x - ray temperature ( @xmath60 ) of the icm , a quantity which is not provided by default in the mcxc catalog .",
    "the mcxc catalog does provide a @xmath61 value that is based on the x - ray luminosity for each cluster , but we preferred not to use this value except for internal comparisons between mcxc clusters .",
    "furthermore , more than half of the cl1604 clusters and groups do not have an associated x - ray measurement due to the high - redshift of the structure and the relatively shallow _ chandra _ imaging , making a self - consistent comparison in this respect impossible . cluster ( and group ) line - of - sight velocity dispersions were measured in a manner nearly identical to that of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and are translated into a virial mass via @xcite :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is newton s gravitational constant and @xmath64 is the value of the hubble parameter at the median redshift of the cluster members . while the velocity dispersion was measured on 89 of the mcxc clusters which passed all of our other criteria , eight were rejected at this point due to extreme non - gaussian velocity distributions , prohibitively sparse spectroscopic sampling , or convergence issues . of the remaining 81 mcxc clusters with well - measured velocity dispersions , the average cluster galaxy velocity dispersion was @xmath65 km s@xmath19 corresponding to @xmath66 . for the bulk of our analysis the galaxies in these clusters will comprise our low redshift comparison sample .",
    "however , later in the paper a comparison will be made between the radial distributions of stellar mass surrounding both the high- and low - redshift bcgs / mmcgs ( see  [ massrad ] ) . for this sample",
    "it is necessary to define a sample of galaxy clusters which have not only a definitively determined mmcg , but for which the stellar mass of all massive nearby companions has been measured . for 21 of the 81 mcxc clusters , the first criterion is not fulfilled ( see  [ mcxc ] ) . of the remaining 60 clusters",
    ", we required that all galaxies within a projected radius of @xmath67 which were within 1.5 magnitudes of the @xmath57 magnitude of the bcg / mmcg have both a measured redshift and a measured stellar mass .",
    "it is important to note that all cl1604 clusters and groups also satisfied these criteria . imposing these additional criteria on the 81 clusters in our full mcxc / sdss sample resulted in 53 clusters .",
    "these clusters have a median velocity dispersion of @xmath68 km s@xmath19 , which corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "these values are not appreciably different from those values of the full sample of 81 mcxc clusters and , as we will show later in this section , the distributions of @xmath27 and @xmath70 between the two samples are not significantly different .    the line - of - sight velocity dispersions and virial masses of the cl1604 clusters and groups were calculated in a manner identical to those of the mcxc clusters with one exception . since six out of the eight cl1604 clusters",
    "/ groups do not have an x - ray centroid , it is necessary to define another center from which to calculate the velocity dispersion .",
    "these were determined in the following manner .",
    "the @xmath32 luminosity - weighted center was calculated for each cluster and group from all members within 1 @xmath71 mpc of the centers defined from red galaxy density maps generated following the method of @xcite .",
    "all member galaxies within 1 @xmath71 mpc of this @xmath32 luminosity - weighted center were then used to calculate a new @xmath32 luminosity - weighted center .",
    "this process was repeated as many times as necessary to achieve convergence , i.e. , where further iterations of this exercise resulted in centers which differed by less than 2@xmath72 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion for each cluster and group was then calculated from all member galaxies within 1 @xmath71 mpc of the final luminosity - weighted center using identical methodology to that of @xcite .",
    "in such a way , information from all galaxy populations is utilized rather than just the red sequence galaxies , important since many of the cl1604 clusters and groups are still in the process of formation . under the limit of a traditional virialized cluster",
    "whose galaxy population is dominated by bright red - sequence galaxies , this exercise reduces to the original center defined by the red galaxy density peaks .",
    "since the line - of - sight velocity dispersions of the mcxc clusters were calculated from populations defined relative to their x - ray centers , this latter point is important for any relative bias between the two methods , as a large fraction of the mcxc clusters exhibit properties of traditional virialized clusters ( see  [ colormag ] ) . indeed ,",
    "if we instead choose the mcxc bcg center as a centroid , which is a good approximation of the luminosity - weighted center , the average change in the measured velocity dispersions is @xmath7310% relative to those calculated using the x - ray center .",
    "this is also the case for the two cl1604 clusters ( a & b ) where this check can be performed .",
    "such a change has no effect on our results and we thus ignore any possible differential bias induced on our two samples as a result of these choices .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion values ( and , as a consequence , @xmath70 ) calculated for the cl1604 clusters and groups , as well as their central coordinates and redshifts , differ slightly from those given in @xcite due to the improved methodology used in calculating @xmath27 . for the cl1604 groups and clusters , the average velocity dispersion was @xmath74 km s@xmath19 and @xmath75 km s@xmath19 , respectively , translating to average virial masses of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",

    "while this results in larger errors , as measurements on individual galaxy spectra are much noiser than those on coadded spectra , it serves the purpose of allowing the observation of the distribution of these quantities amongst the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs .",

    "such a spread in properties over a relatively small sample of galaxies is suggestive of a sporadic process which induces or quenches star formation , though it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions from this number of galaxies .",
    "as we will show in the next section , wet or mixed merging between the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs and their massive companions provides a plausible candidate for this process .",
    "the average doubling time of the cl1604 bcgs and mmcg candidates calculated from the mean ssfr in figure [ fig : sfrnssfrhist ] is 6.5@xmath97 gyr and 8.6@xmath98 gyr , also consistent within the errors of the difference in cosmic time from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",

    "however , relatively strong balmer features are still observed in the average spectrum of the passive cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs , which indicates the presence of a component of moderately young stars . ]",
    "given the inhomogeneity observed in figure [ fig : sfrnssfrhist ] , ensemble - averaged sfr and ssfr properties of the cl1604 bcg / mmcg sample provides only part of the picture .",
    "while there are several cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs which appear to be forming stars prodigiously ( i.e. , @xmath99 @xmath93 yr@xmath19 ) , the majority of the cl1604 bcg / mmcg sample is estimated to be forming stars at rates of 1 @xmath93 yr@xmath19 or lower .",
    "such galaxies do not necessarily fit into the picture derived from the average properties of the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs .",

    ", we adopted the ssfr threshold of ssfr @xmath82 yr@xmath19 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in total , 11 of the 17 combined cl1604 bcg / mmcg sample fell below this threshold .",
    "plotted in figure [ fig : spectralmosaic2 ] is the coadded spectrum , generated in the same way as in figure [ fig : spectralmosaic ] , of the six passive bcgs / mmcgs in cl1604 observed by deimos . as before ,",

    "while this absorption is qualitatively and quantitatively weaker than that in the spectrum shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : spectralmosaic ] , it is strong enough to imply either moderate levels of star formation which ended in the recent past or higher levels of star formation within the last @xmath42 gyr in the _ average _ passive cl1604 bcg / mmcg .",
    "the implied significant buildup of stellar mass of the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs through star formation is in broad agreement with the results of @xcite , in which rest - frame uv - optical colors were used to reveal the prevalence of low- to moderate- star formation events in elliptical galaxies over the redshift @xmath104 .",
    "of course , given the plethora of physical mechanisms hostile to star formation in cluster environments , the average sfr in the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs is likely to decline with decreasing redshift rather than plateau ( though the presence of cooling flows into the bcg could result in increased and possibly sustained levels of high star formation , see @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , as we will show in the next section , even a doubling of the stellar mass of the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs can not account for the observed difference in stellar masses between the mcxc and cl1604 samples .",
    "still , the fact remains that _ in situ _ star formation appears to contribute substantially to the buildup of mass in bcgs and mmcgs from @xmath0 to the present day .      in this section",
    "we compare the concentration of stellar baryonic mass contained in galaxies around the mcxc and cl1604 bcg / mmcg samples in an attempt to determine how much stellar mass these galaxies could accrete through merging processes over the last 7 gyr . in order to make valid comparisons between the galaxy populations of mcxc clusters and those of the cl1604 clusters an important consideration",
    "is necessary which has been eluded to in previous sections .",
    "it has been observed that correlations between the stellar mass of the bcg and the total halo mass of the cluster in which it resides ( e.g. , @xcite ) exist across a wide variety of clusters and redshifts .",
    "the reason it is necessary to account for this correlation here is , unlike other sections , the quantities being compared in this section , stellar mass of the bcg / mmcg and the total stellar mass of the clusters , are inherently linked to mass of the parent cluster in a way that the previous properties are not . in addition , the large homogeneity of the properties investigated in the previous sections of the mcxc bcgs / mmcgs resulted in invariance in our results with respect to the sample being chosen . in this section",
    "we are now studying the relationship between the bcg / mmcg and the cluster population as a whole and , as such , we no longer have the luxury of this invariance .",
    "corrections for the correlation between the stellar mass of a bcg and the total mass of the cluster in which it resides were explored in great detail by @xcite in a study of 160 bcgs observed over a large redshift range ( 0.03@xmath105 ) . the general approach used in @xcite was to evolve the total mass of each of the high - redshift clusters in their sample to the epoch of their low - redshift samples using the mass evolution of clusters observed by @xcite in the millennium @xcite and millennium - ii @xcite @xmath106-body simulations .",
    "the evolved total masses of the high-@xmath45 clusters were then compared to the observed total masses of the low-@xmath45 clusters and a variety of methods were utilized to account for the observed disparity . here we rely heavily on the philosophy of @xcite . all cl1604 clusters and groups were evolved to the mean redshift of the mcxc clusters in a method identical to that of @xcite using the virial mass estimated from @xmath59 as the starting point of the evolutionary model . the resulting average increase in total ( virial ) cluster mass",
    "was found to be a factor of @xmath107 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the average evolved virial cluster mass of the cl1604 clusters and groups ( @xmath108 ) is , however , slightly higher than the mean observed virial mass for the mcxc / sdss sample . to correct for this",
    ", we began cutting the mcxc / sdss sample starting with the lowest virial mass cluster until the mean observed mcxc cluster virial mass equaled that of the evolved cl1604 clusters and groups .",
    "the final mcxc comparison sample comprised a large fraction of the original sample ; of the sample of 53 mcxc clusters defined for this analysis in  [ clustermass ] , the 48 most massive were retained as the mcxc comparison sample ( hereafter simply  comparison sample \" ) .",
    "in addition to the high level of similarity between the average mass of the mcxc comparison sample and the evolved cl1604 clusters and groups , it is important to note that the evolved virial mass range of the cl1604 clusters and groups essentially spans the entire virial mass range of the observed mcxc clusters ( i.e. , those in figure [ fig : mvirdist ] with @xmath109 ) , thereby sampling the sample variance inherent in the mcxc cluster sample .",
    "the minimal difference in the observed virial masses of the @xmath1 clusters and the evolved virial masses of the @xmath0 cl1604 clusters and groups will also be important when we discuss the morphological evolution of the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs in the next section using a sample of all 81 mcxc clusters .",
    "plotted in figure [ fig : stellarmasscum ] is the radial cumulative stellar mass distribution surrounding cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs and those of the comparison sample . for each cluster / group in each sample , the radial distribution was normalized to the virial radius of that cluster / group in order to average the samples at a common scaled physical scale rather than an absolute ( projected ) radial distance .",
    "as will be true for the remainder of this section , only those galaxies which are _ spectroscopically confirmed members _ of each cluster / group are used in this analysis .",
    "the high level of spectroscopic completeness of the cl1604 and mcxc clusters ensures that a large fraction of the true members , including all of the brightest , and , therefore , most massive members in each cluster are represented in the radial distributions . for the cl1604 groups , the level of spectroscopic completeness is not as high as that of the cl1604 clusters and varies considerably from group to group . while it is still true that nearly all of the most massive member galaxies in the groups will be represented in this plot ,",
    "the groups were combined into an average sample to mitigate the effects of differing completeness .",
    "this sample is further combined into a full cl1604 average in figure [ fig : stellarmasscum ] ( black line ) whose spectroscopic completeness ( by construction ) is identical to that of the comparison sample .    several observations can be made from this plot .",
    "the first is the steep inner slope of the radial cumulative stellar mass distribution for the average cl1604 clusters / groups , a phenomenon not observed for the average bcg / mmcg in the comparison sample .",
    "this point will be returned to later in this section . from this plot",
    "it is also possible to directly determine the average growth in stellar mass of the average bcg / mmcg from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "the bcgs in cl1604 are deficient in mass by an average factor of 2.51@xmath1100.71 relative to the comparison sample , where the errors on this quotient are calculated by a combination of the cl1604 stellar mass errors given in  [ cl1604 ] and the sample variance of the comparison sample .",
    "this result is in direct contradiction to previous results that utilized a large sample high - redshift clusters from the european distant cluster survey ( ediscs ; @xcite ) to probe the stellar mass growth of bcgs over the same redshift range @xcite . in that study ,",
    "no stellar mass growth of bcgs was observed between redshift @xmath17 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is unclear whether this contradiction arises due simply to cosmic variance or to some differential bias induced by different methods of comparison between bcgs high- and low - redshift .",
    "however , a more recent study by the same group of people @xcite in which a factor of two growth in bcg stellar mass is observed using a similar sample over the same redshift range strongly suggests that it is the latter .",
    "the factor of stellar mass growth derived for the cl1604 bcgs is similar to that derived in other recent works that combine data from a large number of clusters over similar redshift ranges @xcite .",
    "in addition , the cl1604 mmcgs also appear to grow in stellar mass appreciably over this redshift , suggesting that , at the very least , band - induced selection effects are largely negligible with regard to the binary question of whether or not bcgs / mmcgs have grown in stellar mass over this redshift range . however , the stellar mass growth of mmcgs is milder , with the cl1604 mmcgs being deficient on average by a factor of 1.78@xmath1100.45 relative to their low - redshift counterparts .",
    "the main difference between this quotient and the one determined for the bcgs is the large difference in stellar mass of the cl1604 mmcgs with respect to the bcgs , as the mcxc bcg and mmcg samples are largely the same .",
    "regardless , both growth factors are ( to varying degrees ) consistent with the mass growth of the cluster as a whole over the same redshift range as derived from @xmath106-body simulations ( a factor of @xmath4 2.5 in total mass ) , which suggests that the stellar mass growth of bcgs / mmcgs occurs in lockstep and with the growth of the total mass of the cluster .    exploring this relationship in more detail ,",
    "the dependence between the stellar mass growth within @xmath111 and the total mass of the cluster growth is parameterized with @xmath112 through :    @xmath113    and the bcg stellar mass growth and the total mass of the cluster growth with @xmath114 :    @xmath115    in this work , we obtain a value of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , these values can be directly compared to the slope of the stellar halo mass relation estimated from simulations and optical data ( @xmath118 ; @xcite ) or weak lensing ( @xmath119 ; @xcite ) .",
    "while our results are compatible within the errors , we notice that our average value is significantly higher than those found by other works .",
    "several effects can justify this difference .",
    "first , we are assuming no evolution in the stellar halo mass relation .",
    "although different works @xcite support little evolution with redshift at the massive end , small evolutionary corrections might vary those quantities .",
    "furthermore , theoretical works ( e.g. : @xcite ) have extensively discussed the wide range of uncertainties in modeling this relation which can lead to 0.25 dex or even more .",
    "in addition , fig . 10 in @xcite shows that , to date , there exist few samples able to constrain the high mass regime , in particular the range of halo ( virial ) masses spanned by the cl1604 and mcxc structures ( i.e. , @xmath120 ) .",
    "we note that the sample by @xcite in the halo mass range @xmath121 appears to agree well with both the @xmath112 and @xmath114 derived from our observations in that the average halo - to - stellar mass ratio of the mcxc and cl1604 structures appears to simply extend the trend observed in these structures .",
    "higher than this threshold there exists a significant departure from this trend .",
    "however , for such clusters halo masses are measured via weak lensing and , consequently , the estimation of the dark matter haloes and their errors are not directly comparable to the kinematically - derived halo masses in this work . this exercise , however , serves to illustrate the large uncertainty in the high end of this relation .",
    "unfortunately , it is observationally difficult to improve these results at present .",
    "the main contributor to the errors in @xmath112 and @xmath114 are the errors on the high - z virial masses ( @xmath122 of the errors ) and the systematic uncertainties in the high - z stellar mass estimates ( @xmath123 of the error ) .",
    "the first source of error depends directly on the spectroscopic sampling of the cluster as well as the overall number of clusters to be averaged over , while the second depends on the depth of the rest - frame nir imaging .",
    "given that the high-@xmath45 sample in this work is one of the most complete dataset in terms of spectroscopy coverage available at @xmath124 , a larger sample of clusters spectroscopic covered down to at least the same limiting magnitude as the observations of cl1604 are necessary to constrain these slopes more accurately through observations .",
    "this will perhaps be possible through an inclusion of the full orelse dataset .        in figure",
    "[ fig : stellarmassnorm ] we again plot the radial cumulative stellar mass distribution of galaxies surrounding the cl1604 and comparison sample bcgs / mmcgs .",
    "this time , however , the distribution is normalized by the total stellar mass in each cluster .",
    "it is apparent from the nearly identical fraction of total stellar mass observed at low radii in the combined cl1604 and comparison samples that not only does the stellar mass of bcg / mmcg grow in lockstep with the mass of the cluster as a whole , but it also evolves in tandem with the total stellar mass content of the cluster .",
    "it appears that _ the stellar mass of the bcg is fundamentally linked with the growth of both the baryonic and dark matter mass of the cluster as a whole _",
    ", though , as discussed previously , there exists a large uncertainty on these growth factors . in both the case of the average cl1604 bcg and mmcg",
    ", it can again be seen that the inner profile of the normalized radial cumulative stellar mass distribution is steeper than that of the comparison sample .",
    "this is recast in figure [ fig : stellarmassratio ] in which we plot the ratio of the cl1604 and comparison sample ( un - normalized ) radial cumulative stellar mass distributions ( hereafter  cumulative mass ratio \" ) .",
    "the value of the cumulative mass ratio increases when there is more stellar mass within a given radius ( normalized by the virial radius ) surrounding the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs relative to the low-@xmath45 comparison sample and drops in the reverse case . in the left panel of figure [ fig : stellarmassratio ]",
    "we plot the cumulative mass ratio centered on the bcgs samples . in this light",
    ", the steep inner slope of the cl1604 radial cumulative stellar mass distribution relative to the comparison sample becomes obvious . at very low projected radii ( @xmath125 )",
    "there is a sharp increase in the cumulative mass ratio , which implies a extremely nearby , massive companion or companions surrounding the cl1604 bcgs that are largely absent in the low-@xmath45 comparison sample .",
    "this ratio continues to increase nearly monotonically from @xmath126 to @xmath127 , meaning the number or stellar mass ( or both ) of companions surrounding the _ average _ cl1604 bcg at low projected radii far exceeds those of the low-@xmath45 comparison sample .",
    "the large number of massive companions surrounding the bcgs of the cl1604 clusters and groups is largely consistent with observations of  bcgs \" in a large sample x - ray selected groups that span a large redshift range ( @xmath128 ; @xcite ) . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : stellarmassratio ] the same exercise is performed for the mmcgs . though the same signature of extremely nearby massive companion or companions is seen surrounding the _ average _ cl1604 mmcg ,",
    "the profile of the cumulative mass ratio remains largely flat beyond these radii .",
    "now that we have firmly established the close proximity of a substantial amount of stellar mass surrounding both the high-@xmath45 bcgs and mmcgs , the plausibility of significant stellar mass buildup through merging processes increases considerably . in order to quantify this possibility further , the merging timescale of each galaxy within @xmath129 of each cl1604 bcg and mmcg was calculated using equation 3 of @xcite , which is based on the method presented in @xcite . under this formalism , the merging timescale increases as @xmath130 and linearly with the difference in line - of - sight velocities ( @xmath131 ) and decreases linearly with the mass of the companion galaxy . here",
    "we define major merging candidates as those galaxies which have a stellar mass ratio with respect to the bcg or mmcg of 4:1 or lower and minor merging candidates as those galaxies with stellar mass ratios between 4:1 and 25:1 ( the upper limit being set by the rough stellar mass completeness limit of the cl1604 spectroscopy , see @xcite ) , definitions which are similar to those of other studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . within this projected radius , a total of 47 and 41 merging candidates surround the cl1604 bcgs and mmcgs , respectively .",
    "these galaxies are represented in figure [ fig : spherez ] , where @xmath132 and @xmath131 is plotted for all spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies within @xmath133 surrounding the bcgs and mmcgs of all cl1604 clusters and groups . of the merging candidates within @xmath134 , 51.0% and 31.7% for the bcg and mmcg samples , respectively , are major merging candidates .",
    "the high incidence of major merging candidates at surrounding the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs can be seen in figure [ fig : spherez ] , as many of the galaxies at low @xmath132 and low @xmath131 are of reasonably large stellar mass . however , because of the way we have chosen to represent the galaxies in figure [ fig : spherez ] , with the size of the sphere of all bcgs / mmcgs represented by the most massive bcg / mmcg , and because the definition of major merger is dependent on stellar mass ratios rather than the absolute magnitude of the stellar mass of the bcg / mmcg or its companion , it is not immediately obvious which companion galaxies are of the major merging candidate flavor . regardless , it is sufficient to say that a large fraction of the galaxies at close ( projected ) spatial distances and small differential velocities with respect to the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs are massive and are comprised of nearly all the most massive galaxies in the entire cl1604 clusters / groups sample .",
    "for the 47 and 41 merging candidates surrounding the cl1604 bcgs and mmcgs , respectively , we now make the assumption that all galaxies which have merging timescales lower than the difference in cosmic time between the average redshift of the cl1604 and mcxc / sdss samples ( e.g. , @xmath135 gyr ) merge with their bcg / mmcg companion .",
    "this assumption leads to an average increase in bcg stellar mass of a factor of 2.23@xmath1100.73 and an average increase in mmcg stellar mass of a factor of 1.35@xmath1100.31 .",
    "of the 15 merging candidates with a small enough timescale to have merged by @xmath1 , all but one has a mass ratio lower than 4:1 ( i.e. , 14/15 are major mergers ) .",
    "this high incidence of major merging candidates is similar to that recently found in amongst the bcgs of ten @xmath17 clusters @xcite , which suggests this phenomenon is not unique to the bcgs / mmcgs of the cl1604 supercluster , but is rather common at these redshifts .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the merging events that result from the companion galaxies of the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs are typically not dry ; a majority of the major merging candidates have morphologies or colors or 24@xmath136 detections that imply , along with the properties of the bcg / mmcg , a mixed or wet merging event ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the definitions of dry , mixed , and wet merging as they are applied here ) .",
    "such events subsequently lead to increased star formation activity ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a theoretical view and @xcite for an observation of this phenomenon in the cl1604 supercluster ) , which will in turn increase the resultant stellar mass beyond the simple addition of the stellar masses of the two galaxies . in conjunction with the analysis presented in the previous section , the combination of _ in situ _ star formation , major merging , and merging induced star formation appears more than sufficient to buildup the stellar mass in bcgs / mmcgs from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . as will be discussed in the subsequent section , however",
    ", these results do not preclude the possibility of additional minor merging , as substantial stellar mass of the bcg can be lost to the cluster medium in major merging events .",
    "in the next section we attempt to contextualize these results in terms of parametric morphological evolution between the bcgs / mmcgs of the two samples .",
    "comparing bcg / mmcg structural parameters over cosmic time can , in conjunction with stellar mass and spectral evolution , constrain evolutionary scenarios and differentiate scenarios which solely involve merging from those involving solely adiabatic expansion ( @xcite ) . to this end",
    ", we fit the two dimensional surface brightness ( sb ) profiles of all the bcgs / mmcgs in both the cl1604 and mcxc / sdss samples using galfit 3.0 @xcite , with a single srsic model @xcite .",
    "a single srsic profile is usually sufficient to describe the profiles of  typical \" elliptical galaxies @xcite though bcgs with large haloes , also called dominant ( cd ) galaxies , sometimes require an extra component to describe its light @xcite .",
    "many of the bcgs / mmcgs in our sample exhibit large haloes , primarily in the mcxc / sdss sample .",
    "while a second component can , in principle , be used to model some portion of the halo light , modeling in this manner introduces degeneracies between the different parameters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , most of the halo light likely falls below even the sdss surface brightness limit , confounding the interpretation of this second component in terms of a physical picture ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in the rest of this subsection , structural parameters are derived utilizing only a single srsic profile model for the fitting .",
    "the fitting procedure was as follows .",
    "first , the postage stamps of bcgs and mmcgs from the full sample of the 81 mcxc clusters which defined our full sample were created from the sdss @xmath38 imaging .",
    "the same process was followed for the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs using the acs @xmath32 imaging .",
    "the @xmath38-band sdss imaging was used for the generation of the mcxc postage stamps because this band roughly samples the same rest - frame wavelength range at @xmath1 as the acs @xmath32 band at @xmath0 .",
    "the size of the generated postage stamps were 200 and 100 @xmath71 kpc on a side for the mcxc and cl1604 samples , respectively , considerably larger than those shown in  [ vismorph ] .",
    "these sizes were chosen in order to allow for the measurement of the total profile of the bcg / mmcg in addition to enough  blank \" sky coverage to make a proper determination of the noise properties of each image . following the generation of the postage stamps , point spread function ( psf ) images",
    "were created following the procedure explained in the postage stamp pipeline ( psp ; @xcite ) for the sdss images and @xcite for the acs images .",
    "we then ran sextractor @xcite on the postage stamps with a twofold objective : to create masks of the surrounding objects and to obtain initial positions , orientation angle , and sizes of the central galaxy to be used as initial conditions for galfit .",
    "finally , galfit was run on the all the masked sdss and acs postage stamps .    as alluded to earlier ,",
    "the sdss sample is approximately four times deeper than the acs in limiting surface brightness in terms physical units ( i.e. , 23.5 @xmath44 vs. 94.0 @xmath44 , respectively ) . in order to determine the effect that this differing surface brightness limit might have on our fitting results we performed the following test .",
    "a random subsample of five mcxc bcgs was selected and noise was added to the masked sdss postage stamps to create 7  noise - added \" sdss postage stamps for each mcxc bcg .",
    "the noise was added such a way that the surface brightness limit of the noise - added sdss images , in physical units , ranged between the nominal sdss limit and a limit shallower than that of the acs imaging in equally spaced steps . at each step , the fitting process was repeated . over the relatively large range of surface brightnesses tested here we found essentially no difference in the best - fit parameters ; the variation of the best - fit effective radius and srsic index was @xmath137% and @xmath46% , respectively .",
    "this is also seen in other works using similar tests ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the results presented in this paper are robust to a change of this level on either parameter and we , therefore , take no account of the difference in physical surface brightness depths between the two samples for the remainder of the paper . for illustration ,",
    "we plot in figures [ fig : sbfitlow ] and [ fig : sbfithigh ] the 1d - surface brightness profiles of the mcxc and cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs , respectively , with the results of the single srsic model overplotted .",
    "note that the fits performed in this work are made in two dimensions , while we represent in these figures the one dimensional azimuthally - averaged surface brightness radial profiles including possible satellite galaxies , which are excluded from the fit .",
    "the one component srsic profile sufficiently describes the low- and high - redshift samples in almost all cases .    in figure",
    "[ fig : histo1comp ] , the distributions of the best - fit main structural parameters , effective radius ( @xmath138 ) and srsic index ( @xmath139 ) , derived from the srsic fit are plotted for both the bcgs and mmcgs of the low- and high - redshift samples .",
    "it is apparent from this figure that the bcgs / mmcgs in the low - redshift mcxc / sdss sample are both larger and have increased srsic indices relative to their high - redshift counterparts . in table [ tab : resultfitss ] the average values , along with their errors , of the main structural parameters are given for all samples of bcgs / mmcgs .",
    "a factor of @xmath140 growth in @xmath141 is observed from @xmath0 to @xmath1 in the average bcg and an evolution of the average srsic index of @xmath142 is observed over the same redshift range . for the mmcg sample",
    "the observed evolution in both parameters is similar , with an increase in @xmath141 of a factor of @xmath143 and an increase of the average srsic index of @xmath144 .",
    "as mentioned earlier in this section , these numbers are derived from the full sample of 81 mcxc clusters defined in  [ mcxc ] .",
    "it was shown in  [ clustermass ] that there was not an appreciable difference in cluster properties between the 81 mcxc clusters we selected , the full mcxc cluster sample and the 53 mcxc clusters used as a basis for the sample in  [ massrad ] .",
    "regardless , the average values of the srsic index and size of the bcgs / mmcgs were also calculated from the comparison sample defined in  [ massrad ] .",
    "no significant difference in either of the median structural parameters relative to those derived from our full sample of 81 mcxc clusters were found .",
    "thus , the results presented in this section are broadly applicable to the results presented in other sections .",
    "sample is shown in white and the high@xmath145 sample in black .",
    "the vertical solid dotted and red dashed line refers to the median value for each sample .",
    "the low@xmath145 bcgs / mmcgs have both a higher effective radius and srsic index , on average , than the high@xmath145 bcgs / mmcgs .",
    "these results are quantified in the text . ]",
    "the factor of @xmath3 evolution in size for both the bcgs and mmcgs between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is consistent with evolutionary factors found in other cluster studies @xcite over a variety of redshift ranges .",
    "conversely , in the field ",
    "typical \" massive elliptical galaxies have been observed to increase their size by only a factor of @xmath146 from @xmath1471 to the present day @xcite . given our previous results , it is likely that the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs will accrete stellar mass faster than similar galaxies in the field ( primarily through major mergers ) , which would in turn cause a differential increase in size relative to comparable field ellipticals    however , the evolution in the srsic index from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is moderate ( @xmath148 ) . this evolution is smaller than that expected from many similar measurements for massive field ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this evolution , however , still remains an open question , and the evolution observed amongst the samples presented here are in broad agreement with a measurement of the evolution amongst field and group ellipticals from @xmath17 to the present day ( see fig .",
    "19 in @xcite ) .",
    "environmental effects may play a large role in this evolution and , indeed , in a study of bcgs across a redshift baseline of @xmath12 to @xmath43 , @xcite found no redshift evolution of the srsic index .",
    "thus , in order to attempt to understand the moderate evolution of the srsic index of the bcg / mmcg in our sample , we compared our results with numerical simulations by @xcite , who considered different scenarios , such as adiabatic expansion and major or minor merging , to explain the evolution of structural parameters in massive galaxies . through these simulations , the authors of this study claimed that major and minor mergers will cause both the size and the srsic index of ellipticals to grow in time , while adiabatic expansion could serve to soften the change in the srsic index induced by merging events .",
    "hence , a pure analysis of the structural parameters makes it plausible that the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs evolve through a mixture of different mechanisms , with major / minor merging and adiabatic expansion contributing at different levels and at different times than for massive field ellipticals . in the remainder of the paper",
    "we continue this discussion , using all of our results to contextualize and constrain the prevalence and significance of such mechanisms .",
    "@xmath149 [ tab : resultfitss ]",
    "throughout this work we have shown different lines of evidence , based on the spectral properties , morphological properties , and the radial stellar mass distribution around high- and low - redshift bcgs / mmcgs , that wet or mixed major merging events in tandem with merger induced star formation appears more than sufficient to explain the buildup of the stellar mass from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( see  [ massrad ] ) .",
    "we now attempt to contextualize these results in terms of semi - analytic and hydrodynamical simulations .    in a seminal study ,",
    "@xcite used the millenium simulation to study the formation and evolution of bcgs from a hierarchical point of view .",
    "here we compare our results with their merger tree predictions . in section ",
    "[ massrad ] , we determined that the mean mass quotient of the bcgs is @xmath1470.9 and those at @xmath1 was a factor of @xmath4 2.51@xmath1100.71 .",
    "also in that section it was determined that the stellar mass growth of the bcgs over the same redshift range through major mergers alone was 2.23@xmath1100.73 which is perhaps the more fundamental quantity when comparing to a hierarchical @xmath106-body simulation .",
    "this value is similar to the stellar mass growth found in recent observational works over similar redshift ranges ( e.g. @xcite find a factor of @xmath150 since @xmath124 ) . in the simulations of @xcite a large fraction ( @xmath151% ) of the stellar mass buildup in bcgs",
    "is a result of major merging events , which is in broad agreement with our observational results .",
    "the expected accretion rate estimated from hierarchical merging in @xcite over redshift range of our sample is @xmath43.3 .",
    "this value is higher than either of the values determined from our observational sample and other observational works @xcite , though the difference is only marginally significant .",
    "however , many works have presented evidence of large intracluster light ( icl ) fractions in local clusters ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". predictions from @xmath106-body simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) show that anywhere from 25@xmath15280% of the stellar matter accreted onto bcgs from major merging events ends up lost to the icl . in the previous sections",
    "this effect was not taken into account .",
    "thus , it possible that additional stellar mass buildup is necessary in excess of what is added to the bcgs / mmcgs through the major merging events discussed in  [ massrad ] . as is also discussed in that section and in  [ spectral ] ,",
    "the large number of mixed or wet major merger candidates around the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs will likely increase or at least serve to maintain the already high level of _ in situ _ star formation observed in the average high - redshift bcg / mmcg ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because of the large potential of these galaxies , such stellar mass buildup would likely not be lost to the intracluster medium through supernovae winds or other processes associated strictly with star formation . however , even with the relatively large star formation rate of the average cl1604 bcg / mmcg and assuming a continuous rate from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , a large stellar mass loss ( i.e. , @xmath153% ) during major merging processes still leaves some room for additional stellar mass buildup through other means .",
    "this is true both when comparing to the observed quotient in bcg stellar mass from the mcxc and cl1604 samples ( 2.51@xmath1100.71 ) and to the predictions of @xcite .    in the case of significant mass loss of satellite galaxies during major merging processes ,",
    "it is possible that minor merging could , at least in small part , contribute to the stellar mass buildup of the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs over cosmic time .",
    "the introduction of subsequent minor mergers to major mergers events could also help reconcile the observed evolution in the structural parameters , as minor mergers inflate @xmath141 more quickly for a given evolution in the srsic index than do major mergers @xcite .",
    "however , such minor merging candidates are not detected in our cl1604 spectroscopy , meaning candidate galaxies would have to have extreme mass ratios relative to the bcgs / mmcgs , i.e. , @xmath154 .",
    "depending on the amount of stellar mass lost to the icl in each major and minor merging event ( but requiring that at least 25% is lost ) and assuming a constant sfr of the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs , anywhere from @xmath410 to @xmath155 25:1 minor mergers are allowed by the difference in mass observed between the mcxc and cl1604 samples . given that many galaxies in the cl1604 supercluster have high - quality redshifts and stellar mass measurements at magnitudes fainter ( and stellar masses lower ) than our formal completeness limit , the complete lack of such galaxies observed in the data rules out a large number of minor merging events of this magnitude .",
    "this result is supported by other works , which also find evidence for a very high incidence of major merging candidates in @xmath17 clusters @xcite .",
    "still it is not inconsistent with our data that a few minor merging events with extreme mass ratios could help to build up the stellar mass in high - redshift bcgs .",
    "given the wealth of lower mass blue , gas - rich galaxies still remaining in the cluster and group environments of cl1604 , such events could also aid stellar mass buildup through starbursting events subsequent to cannibalization .",
    "a different mechanism arises when merging events ignite agn activity .",
    "such merging events can be the mixed or wet major merging events , events which we have shown that the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs are fated to undergo , or the cannibalism of low - mass , gas - rich galaxies discussed in the previous section .",
    "such processes are typically characterized by a galaxy losing mass from its central regions in an adiabatic manner producing a response of the stars and dark matter to  puff up \" .",
    "the effects of this mechanism , known as adiabatic expansion , have been observed and characterized by a variety of different observational studies @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , this mechanism is also studied in detail by @xcite , in which numerical simulations were used to study the effect of this mechanism on measured structural parameters .    in this work ,",
    "we have found strong evidence of ongoing or impending major merging amongst the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs .",
    "this observation should be accompanied by a strong evolution of the srsic index between the cl1604 and mcxc / sdss samples .",
    "an evolution of the srsic index is seen from @xmath0 to @xmath1 in our samples , but that evolution is more moderate , only approximately 50% of that expected from simulations . however , observational work on bcgs @xcite in two separate samples spanning from @xmath43 to @xmath12 found no evolution in the srsic index between the two samples , with an increase in @xmath141 similar to what is found in the study presented here . according to @xcite , a small decrease of srsic index",
    "is expected under adiabatic expansion .",
    "thus , a significant amount of adiabatic expansion occurring in conjunction with major ( and possibly minor ) merging events amongst the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs could provide a means to mitigate the increase in the srsic index from merging alone . in other words , if the cl1604 bcgs were to evolve only through some combination of major and minor merging events from @xmath0 to @xmath1 an increase in srsic parameter of a factor between two and four is expected . however , as we have shown , the major merging candidates surrounding the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs will predominantly result in mixed or wet merging events .",
    "the merging events that are observed to be already underway amongst the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs also appear predominantly in late - type hosts .",
    "such events are commonly thought to ignite agn activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which can lead to subsequent adiabatic expansion and a subsequent decrease in the srsic index as measured by the light profile of the galaxy .",
    "the difference between the expected and observed evolution of the srsic index , a difference that is statistically relevant at @xmath156 _ for both subsamples _ , strongly suggests that at least some level of adiabatic expansion must occur in bcgs / mmcgs over the last 7 gyr .",
    "in this study we have analyzed the properties of brightest and most massive cluster and group galaxies at high ( @xmath0 ) and low ( @xmath1 ) redshift . at high redshift ,",
    "the properties of the bcgs / mmcgs of the eight groups and clusters of the cl1604 supercluster were considered .",
    "these were compared to a sample of bcgs / mmcgs of 81 low - redshift clusters drawn from a cross - correlation of the mcxc catalog of x - ray clusters and sdss .",
    "the constituent structures of the mcxc and cl1604 samples were matched in total virial mass and dynamical states using a variety of techniques and comparisons between the bcgs / mmcgs of the two samples were primarily made in a common rest - frame wavelength range . using enormous spectroscopic and imaging databases provided at low redshift by the sdss and at high redshift by orelse , we investigated the evolution of color , morphological , stellar mass , and spectral properties of bcgs / mmcgs over the past @xmath157 gyr .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "* _ color and luminosity evolution : _ a large fraction ( @xmath158% ) of the combined cl1604 bcg / mmcg sample were observed with colors blueward of the red sequence for its parent cluster or group .",
    "in contrast , only a small fraction ( @xmath11% ) of the bcgs / mmcgs at low redshift were observed to be similarly offset of the red sequence .",
    "the gap in magnitude between the bcg and the next brightest cluster / group galaxy in the average cl1604 cluster / group was found to be less than half that of the average mcxc cluster . * _ morphology evolution : _ exactly half of the cl1604 bcg sample were galaxies classified with late - type morphologies and a large fraction ( @xmath159% ) of had signs of interaction .",
    "in contrast , only 2.5% the bcgs at low redshift were classified as late - type and the fraction of those undergoing interactions was less than half of that of the cl1604 sample .",
    "in addition , the cl1604 bcgs were observed in some stage of a merging event greater than five times more frequently than the low-@xmath45 bcgs .",
    "these numbers did not change appreciably when the mmcgs of the two samples were considered . * _ spectral evolution : _ a majority ( @xmath453% ) of the combined cl1604 bcg / mmcg sample show significant ongoing star formation .",
    "in contrast , only a small fraction @xmath160% of the mcxc bcgs / mmcgs were observed with ongoing star formation . from a stacked spectrum of galaxies ,",
    "the average star formation rate of the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs was found to be @xmath161 @xmath93 yr@xmath19 .",
    "this value is in stark contrast with the average sfr of the mcxc - sdss bcg / mmcg , which was consistent with zero .",
    "in addition , strong balmer absorption features and weak features associated with older stellar populations were observed in the cl1604 bcg / mmcg stacked spectrum , which indicated a considerably younger mean luminosity - weighted stellar age as compared to the mcxc / sdss sample .",
    "even those cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs considered passive ( ssfr @xmath162 ) showed signs of a moderately young stellar population . * _ stellar mass evolution : _ the average @xmath0 cl1604 bcg was observed to be deficient in stellar mass by a factor of 2.51@xmath1100.71 relative to a ( cluster total mass ) matched sample of @xmath1 mcxc bcgs .",
    "the average mmcg in cl1604 was found to be deficient in stellar mass by a factor of 1.78@xmath1100.45 relative to the mmcgs same matched low - redshift sample .",
    "surprisingly , this growth factor is consistent with both the increase in total mass and increase of total stellar baryonic mass of the clusters over the same redshift interval .",
    "this result strongly suggested that the growth of the stellar mass of a bcg / mmcg is intimately linked with both the total stellar ( contained in galaxies ) and dark matter growth of the clusters . * _ radial distribution of stellar mass : _ a comparison was made between the stellar mass surrounding the bcgs / mmcgs at low and high redshift in the form of companion galaxies",
    ". a marked increase of stellar mass at low ( projected ) radii @xmath134 was observed surrounding the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs relative to the mcxc bcgs / mmcgs .",
    "merging timescales were calculated for all companion galaxies to the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs that had the possibility of merging within @xmath1637 gyr .",
    "of the 15 merger candidates surrounding the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs with small enough merging timescales , 14 would result in a major merging event ( @xmath1644:1 mass ratio ) .",
    "these potential merging events are primarily comprised of the mixed or wet variety . from these merging events alone",
    ", the average cl1604 bcg will increase in stellar mass by a factor of 2.23@xmath1100.73 and the average cl1604 mmcg by a factor of 1.35@xmath1100.31 under the assumption of 100% retention of stellar matter . * _ structural parameter evolution _ : by fitting the surface brightness profiles of all bcgs / mmcgs in both the high- and low - redshift samples to a single srsic profile , we found an increase of a factor of @xmath165 of the size ( @xmath141 ) of bcgs / mmcgs over the past @xmath157 gyr .",
    "the factor of this size increase was invariant with respect to which low - redshift sample we chose to compare the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs to .",
    "an increase in the average srsic index was also measured over the same redshift range , though its evolution was milder , with an observed increase of @xmath166 .    from our observational data",
    "alone , we strongly favored a scenario in which bcgs / mmcgs grow through a combination of _ in situ _ star formation and major merging events , the latter likely causing subsequent increases in star formation activity .",
    "though we could not completely rule out the involvement of minor mergers in building up at least a small fraction of the stellar mass of the bcgs / mmcgs over the past @xmath157 gyr , the aforementioned scenario is wholly consistent with all of the results in this study .",
    "these observational results were then compared to a variety of hydrodynamical simulations and semi - analytic models chosen from the literature . through these comparisons we found that the observed prevalence of ( potentially ) impending major merging events amongst the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs was sufficient to explain the evolution in the size of bcgs / mmcgs from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . however , the observed evolution in the average srsic index was not as dramatic as that predicted from a large number of major merging events . in order to explain this mild evolution",
    ", we appealed to adiabatic expansion , a process which will serve to soften the evolution of srsic indices of galaxies and a process which naturally follows from the ignition of an agn as a result of a wet or mixed merging event .",
    "this study represents one of the most comprehensive studies of the evolution of bcgs / mmcgs over cosmic time to date in terms of the sheer amount of spectroscopic and imaging data utilized for the galaxy populations of clusters at both high and low redshift . from this study",
    "we were able to draw a definitive picture of the evolution of bcgs / mmcgs in the cl1604 supercluster .",
    "however , the sample of bcgs / mmcgs used here , especially at high redshift , remains somewhat small , and given the large amount of intrinsic variance amongst galaxy cluster populations observed at all redshifts , it is not entirely clear how applicable this picture is to the evolution of an  average \" bcg over the past @xmath157 gyr .",
    "it is encouraging that our results , or at least those which can be directly compared , show broad agreement with similar samples of bcgs taken from other surveys .",
    "however , future work remains to utilize data from the @xmath167 high - redshift clusters and groups of the full orelse sample , as well as datasets available from other high - redshift cluster surveys ( e.g. , ediscs , gclass ) , to determine if the mode of evolution observed here amongst the cl1604 bcgs / mmcgs is fully representative of that of typical bcgs observed across the universe .",

    "the most massive cluster in cl1604 ( b ) shows significant departures from its less massive counterpart , exhibiting both a younger and more active galaxy population and icm properties which appear inconsistent with a high degree of virialization , a trend that is continued for the least massive cluster in cl1604 ( d ) .",
    "the dynamical state of the cl1604 groups is even more ambiguous .",
    "with 50ks of acis - i observations over the entire supercluster , the _ chandra _ observations are simply not deep enough to detect the presence of a hot intragroup medium ( igm ) , nor deep enough to put meaningful limits . while we are able to probe the dynamics of the group galaxies , and do not observe any evidence for significant velocity substructure ( with the possible exception of group c ) , without deep x - ray observations it is impossible to determine definitively the level of virialization of the cl1604 groups .",
    "it has been shown in simulations that massive galaxy clusters which virialize tend to remain in that state , with only minor stochastic fluctuations that cause short - lived departures from virialization ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is , however , much more complicated for lower mass objects ( i.e. , the cl1604 groups ) , which show a larger spread in dynamical states at every epoch and are easier to significantly disturb due to their shallower potential wells .",
    "though it is likely that the cl1604 clusters and groups will be largely virialized by @xmath169 ( the mean mcxc cluster redshift ) , given the inhomogeneity of the cl1604 sample and our ignorance of their current dynamical states and in the evolution of these states to the redshifts of the mcxc clusters , we required that a fraction of the clusters in the low - redshift sample depart in some way from virialization .",
    "in such a way , we can allow for the possibility of at least some fraction of the consitituent clusters and groups of cl1604 to depart from from virialization as they evolve to the present day .",
    "because of the large number of inhomogeneous samples that were drawn upon to create the mcxc catalog , the authors of this catalog chose not to list @xmath170 values . in the absence of x - ray temperatures , we are limited to one point of comparison to infer the level of virialization of the mcxc clusters : the relationship between the x - ray luminosity of the icm and the dynamics of the cluster galaxies . from large samples of local groups and clusters there",
    "exists a broad swath of literature discussing the relationship between these two quantities at low redshift , though there has been a dearth of systematic studies of such structures within the last decade .",
    "this relationship is nearly always measured using x - ray luminosities that are bolometric and are aperture corrected to infinity using a model - dependent correction ( typically a @xmath171-model @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosities available in this study through the mcxc catalog are measured ( or modeled ) in a fixed aperture of @xmath172 and are measured ( or modeled ) over an energy range of 0.1 - 2.4 kev .",
    "while we later adopt the cluster  self - similarity \" relationship of @xcite , we first discuss the possible implications of the differences in x - ray luminosity measurements .    using _ xmm _ observations of a representative sample of low - redshift clusters from the rexcess @xcite survey ,",
    "@xcite measured icm density profiles for each of the clusters in their sample . in that study",
    ", the authors found that the icm density measured at @xmath172 was lower by a factor of @xmath173 from the value in the inner regions of their clusters , suggesting that the integrated x - ray flux originating from the icm at @xmath174 is an accurate approximation of the total integrated x - ray output of the icm .",
    "this claim was further supported by @xcite , in which only minor differences ( @xmath175% ) were observed between @xmath176 and @xmath177 measured at much larger radii .",
    "thus , the difference in spatial measurements between the mcxc catalog and @xmath177 values used to derive  self - similar \" relations between clusters is negligible .",
    "bolometric corrections to observed x - ray luminosities are typically realized through the models of @xcite . in these models",
    ", a large fraction of the luminosity of the icm ( @xmath178% ) is observed in the rest - frame 0.1 - 2.4 kev band , essentially independent of temperature for a reasonable range of values .",
    "since the mcxc clusters are at all at reasonably low redshifts , the @xmath39-correction on @xmath177 for any given cluster is small , meaning that a large fraction of the bolometric luminosity is recovered by the mcxc @xmath177 . taking both the spatial and energy range differences into account ,",
    "the difference between the @xmath179 measured in the mcxc catalog and the @xmath180 measured in @xcite is , at maximum , 20% , and likely significantly less for most of clusters in the mcxc / sdss sample . because we can not constrain this value for any individual cluster in our sample , we chose to ignore this effect and adopt the self - similar relationship of @xcite without correction .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lxsig ] we plot the relationship between @xmath179 as given in the mcxc catalog and the galaxy velocity dispersions for the 81 low - redshift clusters with well - measured velocity dispersions ( see  [ clustermass ] ) .",
    "this is plotted against the backdrop of a best - fit relation for low - redshift virialized clusters @xcite . also plotted are lines which show a @xmath11020% deviation from the best - fit relation , which encompasses the maximum possible fluctuation of an individual mcxc cluster simply resulting from the different methods of calculating @xmath177 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , as mentioned in  [ clustermass ] , some of the mcxc  clusters \" technically fall under the auspices of the term  groups \" . as such ,",
    "also plotted in figure [ fig : lxsig ] is the best - fit relationship determined for groups of galaxies as derived by @xcite .",
    "however , the two relationships ( clusters vs. groups ) have a high level of similarity in the area of this phase space where the majority of our sample lies .",
    "because of this we do not comment on which of these two relationships is more appropriate to adopt for each individual mcxc structure other than to say that the group self - similar relationship may be used to explain some of the mcxc structures that deviate significantly from the cluster relationship , structures whose presence in our sample does not significantly affect our analysis regardless ( see , e.g. ,  [ colormag ] ) . as such",
    ", we have simply refered to the mcxc structures as  clusters \" throughout the study and continue to do so here .",
    "the 81 galaxy clusters plotted in figure [ fig : lxsig ] are broadly representative of the 53 mcxc galaxy cluster adopted for use in some analyses in this paper ( see [ massrad ] ) ; a ks test of the x - ray luminosities of the two sampled show the samples to be statistically indistinguishable .",
    "in addition , the fractions presented here are invariant with respect to which sample is chosen .",
    "a large fraction of the selected mcxc clusters appear consistent with the @xcite self - similar relationship .",
    "however , a small fraction ( @xmath417% ) of the mcxc clusters deviate significantly ( @xmath181 ) from this relationship , implying that at least some fraction of the sample is still undergoing virialization at @xmath1 .",
    "this fraction remains essentially unchanged if we apply the 20% correction discussed above .",
    "the measured fraction is roughly equivalent to the fraction of virialized clusters at @xmath43 in halo masses greater than the evolved virial mass of the least massive cl1604 structure ( group i ) in simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and observations of local abell clusters @xcite . in the case of the latter ,",
    "the data derived from that study were re - analyzed to calculate an equivalent quantity to the one explored here resulting in a fraction of 22.7% .",
    "thus , it appears that the mcxc / sdss sample loosely exhibits a representative distribution of dynamical states potential descendants of the cl1604 clusters and groups . without further knowledge of the true dynamical states of the cl1604 clusters and groups and their evolution , it is sufficient for the purposes of this study that the potential descendants of these clusters which serve as the points of comparison for this study span dynamical states which are broadly representative of galaxy clusters in the local universe .     drawn from the mcxc catalog .",
    "the method used to calculated velocity dispersions and their errors is given in  [ clustermass ] . because of the original inhomogeneity of the x - ray data used for the mcxc clusters and the complicated method of transformation , errors on @xmath179 are not given for each object , though they are roughly @xmath182% on average .",
    "the blue solid line is adapted from @xcite and shows the expected relation between the two quantities for virialized clusters .",
    "the gray dashed lines represent a @xmath11020% departure from this relationship , which is likely the maximum possible correction to the relationship resulting from the differing methodology used to derive the x - ray luminosity values of the clusters in @xcite and those of the mcxc catalog .",
    "the green dotted line shows the same relation for groups of galaxies adapted from @xcite .",
    "while a large majority of the mcxc clusters are consistent with virialization , a non - negligible fraction appear to be still in the process of relaxing . ]"
