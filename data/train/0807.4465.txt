    "in recent years , there has been much interest in the properties of hard sphere fluids .",
    "the study of such systems has played a central role in the understanding of classical fluids and serves as a starting point for the construction of perturbation theories of fluid properties .",
    "a particular interest has been systems of hard hyperspheres @xcite ( i.e. the generalization of spheres to dimensions larger than three , @xmath5 ) .",
    "there are several reasons for this interest .",
    "firstly , as in a variety of interacting many - body systems @xcite , one expects studies of hard - sphere packings in high dimensions to yield great insight into the corresponding phenomena in lower dimensions , such as ground and glassy states of matter @xcite .",
    "secondly , it is hoped@xcite that analytical investigations of hard hyperspheres in large spatial dimensions can serve as an organizing device for a systematic expansion in inverse powers of the dimension , @xmath6 . from a completely different perspective , hard hypersphere systems play an important role in communication theory .",
    "for example , it is known that the optimal way of sending digital signals over noisy channels correspond to the densest sphere packing in a high - dimensional space @xcite , so called  spherical codes \" .",
    "it is common to describe hard - core fluids using approximate theories@xcite .",
    "there are two main reasons for using such approximate theories : on the one hand , a solution of the full problem was , and still is , extremely difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "approximate methods have led to very good predictions in the low density phase . among the most widely used approximations",
    "is the percus - yevick ( py ) equation for @xmath6-dimensional hard spheres @xcite , which is exact to first order in the density of the fluid@xcite , @xmath7 .",
    "a great deal of progress has been made towards understanding the solutions of the py equation in odd dimensions . in principle",
    ", the work of baxter@xcite and leutheusser@xcite reduces the py equation to a set of nonlinear algebraic equations of order @xmath8 for @xmath5 .",
    "however , these can only be solved analytically for @xmath9 so that results in higher odd dimensions must be found numerically .",
    "a more complete survey of the literature for odd dimensions may be found elsewhere@xcite .    in even dimensions",
    "the situation is much less developed . in two dimensions",
    "an approximate numerical solution of the py equation was found by lado  @xcite .",
    "leutheusser @xcite was able to fit many of lado s results using an ansatz for the direct correlation function .",
    "other results available in the literature for hard discs are solutions of the full problem based on molecular dynamics ( md ) or monte carlo ( mc ) methods @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors solved the py equation for hard discs @xcite , by developing a method that reduces the problem to a set of integral equations that are solved numerically without major difficulties .    in larger even dimensions",
    "there are some md simulations@xcite , mc simulations@xcite , mc calculations @xcite and a few analytical results for the low order virial coefficients @xcite . on the analytical front ,",
    "rosenfeld @xcite generalized leutheusser s ansatz@xcite to higher dimensions and compared the results with the analytical results in three and five dimensions . however , to our knowledge , the py equation has not been solved in any even dimension apart from @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    ", we solve the py equation for some even dimensions ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "we do so by generalizing our previous work @xcite , which was based on techniques borrowed from the resolution of crack problems @xcite and uses some results from baxter s classical method  @xcite .",
    "the main difference from the hard sphere case ( and any odd dimension in general ) is that the problem of finding the total correlation function and the direct correlation function are coupled .",
    "this means that the present analysis necessarily yields both correlation functions and therefore provides the equation of state .",
    "the advantage of the current method over previous approaches is that it provides all the quantities of interest as power - series in the density .",
    "thus , questions like existence of negative virial coefficients in four dimensions@xcite and more generally the radius of convergence of the series in large dimensions @xcite can be tackled .",
    "the pair correlation function @xmath11 is related to the direct correlation function @xmath12 through the ornstein - zernike equation by @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath7 is the particle number density and @xmath14 is the total correlation function@xcite .",

    "we observe that in py theory with @xmath3 the virial coefficients determined by both routes are negative for even @xmath138 .",
