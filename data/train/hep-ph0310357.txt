    "phenomenology of high energy deep - inelastic scattering in the framework of qcd leads to the study of evolution equations for the gluon distribution function @xmath0 at high density @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 is the rapidity of the evolved gluons and plays the rle of the evolution variable , and @xmath2 is their transverse momentum .",
    "the main feature of these evolution equations is that they contain nonlinear damping terms which make them difficult to solve by general methods .",
    "these damping terms reflect the effect of saturation , which is due to the recombination of partons densely packed together .",
    "the evolution at low density is well - understood and is described by a linear equation .",
    "the deep saturation regime can also be evaluated .",
    "however , the transition between these two regimes is still a challenge .",
    "some interesting approaches for solving non - linear evolution equations have been proposed @xcite .",
    "recently , the use of solutions of the linear evolution supplemented by `` absorbing '' boundary conditions has been proposed to determine the energy dependence of the saturation momentum @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to propose a new method for handling this problem .",
    "it is based on a deep connection that we have found between the formation of traveling wave fronts in nonlinear physics and the transition to saturation .",
    "we expect our method to be very general and applicable for various types of equations . in the present paper",
    ", we are going to apply it in detail to the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite , which reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "the qcd coupling @xmath5 is either fixed or runs with @xmath2 , in which case it is given by @xmath6 the function @xmath7 is the well - known balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) kernel @xcite @xmath8 and @xmath9 is an integro - differential operator which may be defined with the help of the formal series expansion @xmath10 for some given @xmath11 between 0 and 1 , _ i.e. _ for the principal branch of the function @xmath7 .",
    "the bk equation is expected to capture the main features of saturation effects in high energy scattering processes like virtual photon - nucleus ( or proton under certain conditions ) total cross section .    in a previous paper and in the case of fixed qcd coupling ,",
    "we have already shown @xcite the intimate connection between the limiting speed of a wave front and geometric scaling , namely the dependence of @xmath0 on a unique scaling variable @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the so - called _",
    "saturation scale_. interestingly enough , geometric scaling has been observed in the hera data on inclusive @xmath14 scattering @xcite .",
    "one aspect of the present letter is to go beyond these asymptotic results and to show how the approach to geometric scaling is related to the mechanism of wave front formation .",
    "this requires a method to get information on the form of the wave front when rapidity increases .",
    "another goal is to extend our analysis to both fixed and running qcd coupling .    in sec.[2 ] , we present the general method that we propose . in sec.[3 ] , we treat the fixed coupling problem and in sec.[4 ] the running coupling one . for both cases",
    "we derive the expressions for the saturation scale @xmath15 and for the gluon density @xmath16 in the vicinity of the geometric scaling region @xmath17 .",
    "the final sec.[5 ] is devoted to a discussion and summary .",
    "let us outline the method how to investigate traveling wave solutions to nonlinear partial derivative equations .",
    "our analysis comes from the physics of linearly unstable front equations of diffusion type . they appear _",
    "e.g. _ for rayleigh instabilities in hydrodynamical flows , directed polymers in random media , chemical and bacterial growth models etc ... @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations have the property to admit traveling wave solutions .",
    "their existence is due to nonlinear damping while some of their large time characteristic features ( front velocity , front shape ) are determined by the _",
    "linearized _ equation about the unstable state .",
    "the front is said to be `` pulled '' by this unstable state which appears as an unstable fixed point of the equation .",
    "the main rle of the nonlinearities is to cause saturation .",
    "let us illustrate these features on the generic equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a linear operator acting on functions of @xmath20 , @xmath21 contains the nonlinearities , with the requirement that @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 is a fixed point .",
    "this fixed point is furthermore required to be unstable with respect to perturbations , which has to be checked in each particular case .",
    "the simplest case is the fisher and kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( kpp ) equation @xcite corresponding to @xmath25 and @xmath26 , for which rigorous mathematical results are available @xcite . using a change of variables , we have shown @xcite that the bk equation reduces to the kpp equation when its kernel  ( [ chi ] ) is approximated by the first three terms of the expansion  ( [ chiexpansion ] ) .    more generally , on physical grounds ) .",
    "] , we expect the methods developed to treat the kpp equation to be valid for any saturation equation in qcd .",
    "indeed , the common feature of these equations is that their nonlinearities cause saturation of the parton densities , and the fixed point of low gluon density is clearly linearly unstable under rapidity evolution .",
    "this instability is physically related to the growth of parton densities with rapidity given by the bfkl equation @xcite .",
    "we shall study the form of the wave front at large times by working in its own reference frame which is defined by the change of variable @xmath27 , and in the neighbourhood of the front , namely @xmath28 .",
    "the velocity @xmath29 of the wave front will be determined by consistency as the velocity of the slowest wave present in the initial wave packet .",
    "the solution to the linear part of equation  ( [ general ] ) corresponds to a linear superposition of waves : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mellin transform of the linear kernel ( @xmath32 for the kpp equation ) and defines the dispersion relation of the linearized equation . in particular",
    ", each partial wave of wave number @xmath33 has a _ phase velocity _ @xmath34",
    "whose expression is found by imposing that the exponential factor in eq.([inicond ] ) be time independent for @xmath35 .",
    "by contrast , the _ group velocity _ is defined by the saddle point @xmath36 of the exponential phase factor @xmath37    let us show that the actual velocity @xmath29 of the front depends on the competition between the singularities of @xmath38 and the saddle point of the phase factor .    in eq.([inicond ] ) , @xmath38 is the initial condition in mellin space , _ i.e. _ the mellin transform of @xmath39 .",
    "the physically appropriate assumption is that @xmath38 is a monotoneous function smoothly connecting 1 to 0 as @xmath20 goes from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , with asymptotic behavior @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "then @xmath38 has singularities on the real axis starting at @xmath43 and extending to the left , and at @xmath11 to the right .",
    "a simple case study is @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 , whose exact mellin transform is @xmath48 .",
    "the contour @xmath49 in  ( [ inicond ] ) runs parallel to the imaginary axis and crosses the real axis at a point between 0 and @xmath11 .",
    "there are three relevant cases ( see fig.1 ) :    _ ( i ) _ @xmath50 : dominance of initial conditions .",
    "the integral  ( [ inicond ] ) defining @xmath51 is dominated by the pole at @xmath11 , thus @xmath52 and the velocity of the front is determined by consistency to be @xmath53 , which ensures the time - independence in the reference frame of the front .    _",
    "( ii ) _ @xmath54 : dominance of the saddle point .",
    "the integral in eq.([inicond ] ) is now @xmath55 and thus the velocity @xmath29 of the front is defined by @xmath56 indeed , in this case , the group velocity is identical to the minimum of the phase velocity in analogy with wave physics , has been written in ref.@xcite . ] . in the previous case instead ,",
    "the front velocity is @xmath57 .    _",
    "( iii ) _ @xmath58 : critical case . both the pole and the saddle point",
    "contribute , and @xmath59 .",
    "now that we have determined the velocity of the wave front , reporting it in eq.([inicond ] ) and performing the integral in the large @xmath60 limit gives the asymptotic expression for the form of the front : @xmath61 the typical wave front solutions are illustrated on fig.2 .",
    "the upper plot displays a typical feature of the wave front development for the case @xmath50 . here the front moves with the velocity @xmath62 and keeps the memory of the initial condition .",
    "the lower plot illustrates the case @xmath54 . in this case",
    ", the wave front develops with the fixed group velocity @xmath63 .",
    "the forward part of the curve ( after the knee ) is the part of the front which keeps the memory of the initial condition , which is a typical feature of a `` pulled '' front @xcite .",
    "the middle plot is for the critical case @xmath58 .    in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the case in which the initial condition is steep enough , so that the velocity of the front is the group velocity  ( [ groupvelocity ] ) and the form of the wave front is the second equation of  ( [ asymptotic ] ) .",
    "it is interesting for our purpose to go beyond the asymptotics  ( [ asymptotic ] ) and study how the front reaches its asymptotic form as a function of time . for this sake",
    ", we shall use the following ansatz in the neighbourhood of the front : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a subdominant function of time ( with respect to @xmath66 ) .",
    "indeed , the front velocity receives some subasymptotic corrections w.r.t .",
    "the constant asymptotic velocity @xmath63 , contained in the derivative @xmath67 .",
    "the factors @xmath68 describe a diffusion - like evolution which will be made explicit in each particular case . hence the function @xmath69 represents a subasymptotic correction to the form of the front  ( [ asymptotic ] ) at large times .",
    "this ansatz was proven to be relevant for kpp - like equations  @xcite .",
    "its key property is to be a solution of the linearized equation at large @xmath60 in the neighbourhood of the front , for some @xmath70 and @xmath65 to be determined .",
    "note that since @xmath71 only depends on @xmath72 when the front has reached its asymptotic form of a pure traveling wave , @xmath73 is required to vanish like @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "the features of this ansatz are displayed on the lowest plot in fig.2 .",
    "one sees that a steep initial condition characterized by the exponential decay slope @xmath11 evolves , after a given time @xmath60 , into a front characterized by the critical exponential decay slope @xmath36 .",
    "its width is of order @xmath68 as we will show later on . +",
    "let us first apply the formalism exposed above to the bk equation with fixed coupling @xmath5 .",
    "the linear part of eq.([bk ] ) is solved by @xmath76 the rapidity @xmath1 is the evolution variable , and thus plays the rle of the time @xmath60 , while @xmath77 plays the rle of the spatial coordinate @xmath20 .    let us discuss the relevant initial condition @xmath78 for qcd .",
    "the essential property for the derivation is that at large @xmath79 ( _ i.e. _ large @xmath2 ) , @xmath80 : this corresponds to the color transparency property of gauge theories , and yields @xmath81 . for @xmath79 small or negative ,",
    "the dynamics is unknown since it belongs to the nonperturbative regime of qcd .",
    "however , interestingly enough , it does not play a direct rle in the final result for the front formation .",
    "one may assume that @xmath82 is bounded @xcite , which is a way to impose unitarity on the initial condition .",
    "in mellin space , this leads to singularities of @xmath78 distributed on the intervals @xmath83-\\!\\infty,0]$ ] and @xmath84",
    ". we shall verify in a moment that the wave number @xmath36 which minimizes the _ phase velocity _ , _",
    "i.e. _ the wave number of the partial wave which moves with the _ group velocity _ , is between 0 and 1 .",
    "thus we are in the case _",
    "( ii ) _ of sec.[2 ] in which the saddle point dominates .",
    "we shall now proceed to the determination of the analogous of the group velocity @xmath63 . by comparison of eq.([linsol ] ) to eq.([inicond ] ) , one sees that the dispersion relation reads @xmath85 the phase velocity @xmath86 has a minimum at @xmath36 . from eqs.([groupvelocity],[frontvelocity ] ) , @xmath36 solves the implicit equation @xmath87 which yields @xmath88  .",
    "this number indeed stands between 0 and 1 , and thus we are in a similar situation as the one depicted on the third plot of fig.2 : the front velocity is blocked at the value @xmath89    to study the formation of the front , we will stick to the `` diffusive '' approximation of the bk equation  ( [ bk ] ) , defined by keeping terms up to the second order only in the expansion  ( [ chiexpansion ] ) : @xmath90 within this approximation , the nonlinear equation becomes @xmath91 which is equivalent to the kpp equation @xcite .",
    "we now use the ansatz  ( [ ansatz ] ) as the appropriate solution of the linearized version of eq.([bkapprox ] ) near the wave front . setting @xmath92 ,",
    "@xmath93 and @xmath94 , the linear part of eq.([bkapprox ] ) turns into an ordinary differential equation for @xmath73 , namely @xmath95 where @xmath74 is related to the physical variables through @xmath96 the different terms in eq.([bkapproxlineaire ] ) contribute equally if @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a constant .",

    "@xmath110 @xmath111 absorbs undetermined constants but remains of order @xmath112 .",
    "we turn to the case in which the coupling in eq.([bk ] ) runs with @xmath79 as given by eq.([baralpharun ] ) .",
    "the bk equation reads @xmath113 with @xmath114 defined in eq.([baralpharun ] ) .",
    "using a double mellin transform , the linearized version of the equation gives the solution @xmath115 where @xmath116 at this stage , @xmath117 is an undetermined constant .",
    "the initial condition @xmath118 depends now both on @xmath119 and @xmath33 , but has to satisfy the same requirements as in the fixed coupling case ( color transparency at large @xmath2 , saturation at smaller @xmath2 ) resulting in a specific analytic structure in @xmath33 as already discussed in sec.iii .    performing the integral over @xmath119 in the large @xmath1 limit , the integral",
    "is dominated by a saddle point at @xmath120 .",
    "the solution reads @xmath121 where @xmath78 keeps track of all prefactors . now interpreting @xmath122 as the time variable @xmath60 , the gluon density turns out to be also a linear superposition of traveling waves labelled by @xmath33 , and thus can be treated by the general method exposed in sec.[2 ] . in this case",
    ", the asymptotic dispersion relation is @xmath123 the minimum @xmath124 of @xmath86 satisfies the equation @xmath125 still depending at this stage on the choice of @xmath117 in eq.([x ] ) .",
    "the velocity of the front ( see eq.([groupvelocity ] ) ) is given by @xmath126 requiring the velocity @xmath63 to become independent of the choice of @xmath117 leads to the constraint @xmath127 , namely @xmath128 the comparison with eq.([defbargamma ] ) shows that @xmath124 is identical to @xmath88 , the critical wave number in the non - running case , and thus the velocity of the front reads @xmath129    once the asymptotic velocity is known , we compute the transition to saturation through subleading corrections to @xmath63 . to this aim , one expands the linearized bk equation around @xmath36 to get @xmath130 one uses the ansatz  ( [ ansatz ] ) for the solution to this equation at large @xmath60 , which turns it into an ordinary second order differential equation . after tedious but straightforward compilation of all terms",

    "let us discuss our final results for fixed ( [ nfixedalpha],[qsfixedalpha ] ) and running ( [ nrunningalpha],[qsrunningalpha ] ) coupling . in both cases , we get the leading exponential terms ( resp . @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) in the expressions for the saturation scale found in refs.@xcite .",

    "it is interesting to note that numerical simulations of the fixed coupling case @xcite and of the full equation with running coupling @xcite confirm the validity of the analytic estimates .    to summarize , in this paper",
    ", we have proposed a general method , physically appealing , which allows to determine both the saturation scale and the transition of the gluon density towards saturation for the solution of the balitsky - kovchegov nonlinear equation .",
    "the method is based on a direct analogy with traveling wave solutions of nonlinear equations of the kpp type .",
    "the saturation scale is related to the velocity of the wave front , and the transition to saturation of the gluon distribution to the diffusive type formation of the front .",
    "in particular , we have studied directly the solution to the nonlinear equation , instead of assuming specific boundary conditions on the linear one .    as first applications of this method , using a general ansatz @xcite",
    ", we have derived in a rather simple way the physical solutions to the bk equation at large rapidity for both fixed and running coupling , see eqs.([nfixedalpha],[qsfixedalpha ] ) and  ( [ nrunningalpha],[qsrunningalpha ] ) .",
    "the approach to saturation ( leading to geometric scaling violations ) corresponds to ordinary diffusion ( namely with a diffusion length going like @xmath147 ) in the fixed coupling case and to anomalous diffusion ( in @xmath148 ) in the running coupling case .",
    "these contrasted diffusion patterns towards saturation are made explicit in the evolution of the reduced front profile @xmath149 shown on fig.3 .",
