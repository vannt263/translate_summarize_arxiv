    "we report on our recent progress in radiation transfer modeling for supernova - fallback disks and non - magnetic neutron star ( ns ) atmospheres .",

    "[ disks ] . we then present effects of compton scattering on the thermal spectra of ns atmospheres ( sect .  [ compton ] ) . in sect .",
    "[ nsmodels ] we describe the construction of new line - blanketed nlte atmosphere models for nss . these models are applied to x - ray burst spectra of  ( sect .  [ exo ] ) .",
    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are slowly rotating young isolated nss .",
    "their x - ray luminosities greatly exceed the rates of rotational energy loss .",
    "it is now generally believed that axps are magnetars and that their x - ray luminosity is powered by magnetic energy . as an alternative explanation",
    "the x - ray emission was attributed to accretion from a disk that is made up of supernova - fallback material @xcite .",
    "it is still a matter of debate whether the disk model is appropriate .",
    "for example , the discovery of optical pulsations in 4u0142 + 61 with the same period like the x - ray pulsations @xcite appears to be a strong argument against the disk model .",
    "it was argued that reprocessing of the pulsed ns x - ray emission in the disk can not explain the high optical pulsed fraction , because disk radiation would be dominated by viscous dissipation and not by reprocessed ns irradiation @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite showed that the optical pulsations can be explained either by the magnetar outer gap model or by the disk - star dynamo model . a spectral break in the optical spectrum of 4u0142",
    "+ 61 was discovered by @xcite and also taken as an argument against the disk model .",
    "the recent discovery of mid - ir emission from this axp @xcite , however , has strongly rekindled the interest in studies of fallback - disk emission properties .",
    "the emission was attributed to a cool , passive dust debris disk , but it was shown by @xcite that it can be explained by an active , dissipating gas disk .    the emission from fallback disks",
    "was hitherto modeled with blackbody spectra . in view of the importance of disk models for the quantitative interpretation of observational data",
    "it is highly desirable to construct more realistic models by detailed radiation - transfer calculations .",
    "we employ our computer code acdc @xcite . for a detailed description of the calculation of fallback disk models",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the radial disk structure is calculated assuming a stationary , keplerian , geometrically thin @xmath0-disk .",
    "for the results reported here we selected the following model parameters .",
    "the ns mass is 1.4  @xmath4 .",
    "the radii of the inner and outer disk edges are 2000 and 200000  km , respectively .",
    "the accretion rate was set to @xmath6  @xmath4/yr , which is a relatively large value .",
    "it is motivated by the fact , that this corresponds to the upper limit for the non - detection of uv radiation from a possible disk around sn  1987a under the assumption of an outer disk radius of 100000  km @xcite .",
    "our code allows for the irradiation of the disk by the central source , however , the results presented here are computed with zero incident intensity .",
    "the disk is represented by nine rings .",
    "the vertical structure of each ring is determined from the simultaneous solution of the radiation transfer equations plus the structure equations ( radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium ) .",
    "they also consist of the non - lte rate equations for the atomic population densities .",
    "the chemical composition of sn fallback material is not exactly known .",
    "it depends on the amount of mass that goes into the disk .",
    "a disk with a small mass ( say @xmath7  @xmath4 ) will be composed of silicon - burning ash @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we assume a pure - iron disk composition but also tested a composition that represents silicon - burning ash .",
    "it contains iron ( 80% mass fraction ) as well as silicon and sulfur ( 10% each ) .",
    "[ spectrum_entire_disk_rotation ] displays the overall disk spectrum .",
    "we summarize the model properties as follows :    .",
    "broad iron - line blends are detectable even in the almost edge - on case . ]",
    "* depending on the inclination , the disk flux can be a factor of two higher or lower compared to a blackbody radiating disk at the same inclination . *",
    "strong iron line blanketing causes broad ( @xmath8100   ) spectral features that could be detectable even from almost edge - on disks . *",
    "limb darkening affects the overall disk spectrum ( in addition to the geometric foreshortening factor ) . depending on inclination and spectral band ,",
    "the disk intensity varies up to a factor of three . *",
    "the overall disk spectrum is independent of the detailed chemical composition as long as fe is the dominant species . in particular ,",
    "a pure - fe composition is spectroscopically indistinguishable from si - burning ash . *",
    "the overall disk spectrum is hardly influenced by non - lte effects , however , equivalent widths of individual line blends can change by a factor of two .",
    "( @xmath9  k ) computed with thomson ( dashed lines ) and compton ( full lines ) electron scattering . ]",
    "the nature of isolated ns ( ins ) surface layers is not exactly known . at some conditions ( depending on surface temperature , magnetic field strength and chemical composition )",
    "a surface can be solid , liquid , or have a plasma envelope @xcite . in the last case the envelope can be considered as a ns atmosphere , and the structure and emergent spectrum of this atmosphere",
    "can be computed by using stellar model atmosphere methods .",
    "such modeling was performed by many groups and the model spectra were used to fit observed ins x - ray spectra .",
    "one of the important results of these works is that spectra of light elements ( hydrogen and helium ) atmospheres with low magnetic field are significantly harder than the corresponding blackbody spectra .",
    "these elements are fully ionised in atmospheres with @xmath10  k. therefore , the true opacity ( mainly due to free - free transitions ) decreases with photon energy as @xmath11 . at high energies",
    "electron scattering is larger than the true opacity and photons emitted deep in the atmosphere ( where @xmath12 ) escape after few scatterings on electrons . in all previous work concerning ins , coherent ( thomson ) electron scattering",
    "is considered . as a result , emergent spectra are very hard .",
    "but such a situation is very favorable to change the photon energy due to compton down - scattering .",
    "it is well known that compton down - scattering determines the shape of emergent model spectra of hotter ns atmospheres with @xmath13 k close to the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "these model spectra describe the observed x - ray spectra of x - ray bursting ns in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , and they are close to diluted blackbody spectra with a hardness factor @xmath14  1.51.9 . but",
    "models with compton scattering taken into account were not calculated for relatively cool atmospheres with @xmath15  k. therefore , at present time , the effect of compton scattering on emergent spectra of ins model atmospheres with @xmath16  k is not well known .",
    "we investigated the effect of compton scattering on hot ( @xmath17  k ) ins atmospheres with weak magnetic fields ( @xmath18  g ) . in order to compute lte model atmospheres in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium",
    "we solve the radiation transfer equation with the kompaneets operator .",
    "we calculated a set of models with @xmath19 in the range 15@xmath20  k , with two values of surface gravity ( = 13.9 and 14.3 ) , and different chemical compositions @xcite and the results can be summarized as follows :    * radiation spectra computed with compton scattering are softer than those computed without compton scattering at high energies ( @xmath21  5  kev ) for light element ( h or he ) model atmospheres ( fig .  [ sul_fg1b ] ) .",
    "* the compton effect is most significant in h model atmospheres and models with low surface gravity . *",
    "compton scattering is less important in models with solar abundance of heavy elements . * the emergent spectra of the hottest ( @xmath22  k )",
    "models can be described by diluted blackbody spectra with hardness factors @xmath23  1.61.9 .",
    "we are computing a new grid of model atmospheres for weakly magnetized inss . since it covers a large -range up to high temperatures ( 110@xmath24  k ) it takes into account deviations from lte for the first time . @xcite",
    "have shown that nlte effects can affect the temperature structure of the outer photospheric layers .",
    "the models are line - blanketed and calculated for different chemical compositions comprising h , he , c , n , o , and iron ( rauch , suleimanov , werner , in prep . ) .",
    "we employ the tmap ( tbingen model atmosphere package ) codes @xcite and account for opacities of millions of iron lines in a statistical way @xcite .",
    "the model atoms are constructed using energy levels from nist and oscillator strengths and photoionisation cross - sections calculated by the opacity project ( tiptopbase ) . as an example , in fig .",

    "@xcite have announced the detection of absorption features in the burst spectra of the lmxb .",
    "the three most significant features were identified as photospheric absorption lines , redshifted by @xmath1=0.35 : a feature at 13.00    in the early - burst phases was assigned to the n=23 transition at @xmath27=9.59.7   . in the late - burst phase",
    "a feature appears at 13.75    and it was assigned to the n=23 transition at @xmath27=10.2   .",
    "a double feature at 25.2/26.0   , also appearing in the late - burst phase , was interpreted as a broad self - reversed line profile from  ly@xmath28 ( @xmath27=18.97   ) .",
    "we can use our models to check these line identifications .",
    "the upper curve in fig .  [ exomodels ] is the spectrum of a fe - dominated ( 99% ) model with = @xmath29  k , = 14.39 , redshifted by @xmath1=0.35 .",
    "this figure can be directly compared to fig .  1 in @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the aforementioned / lines at ( redshifted ) @xmath30=13.0/13.75    are much too weak in the model . in models with different  these lines",
    "are even weaker , so that the identification by @xcite is not confirmed .",
    "other fe lines in the models are much stronger and we suggest another possible line identification in the observed spectra .",
    "the lower curve in fig .  [ exomodels ] shows a solar - composition model with the same  and  but with a different redshift , namely @xmath1=0.24 .",
    "the observed lines at @xmath30=13.0/13.75    could stem from ( n=23 , @xmath27=10.611.4   ) .",
    "the  ly@xmath28 line is located at 23.6    in the @xmath1=0.24 redshifted model and a weak feature is seen in the observed spectrum at this location .",
    "we would like to stress that our analysis is in a very preliminary stage .",
