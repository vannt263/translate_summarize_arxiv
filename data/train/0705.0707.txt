    "a survey of the entire northern hemisphere sky for sources of tev gamma rays has been performed using the milagro gamma ray observatory @xcite .",
    "this paper reports on observations of sources in the region of galactic longitude @xmath2 $ ] and latitude @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "this survey is at a higher energy of @xmath6 tev and in a different region than the survey performed by the hess atmospheric cherenkov telescope ( act ) above 200 gev .",
    "the hess survey covered @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] and resulted in the detection of 14 new sources @xcite . at even lower energies ,",
    "egret on the compton gamma ray observatory detected 80 sources above 100 mev @xcite and 28 sources above 1 gev @xcite within 10 deg of the galactic plane .",
    "fourteen of these gev sources are in the region surveyed by milagro .",
    "most of the egret sources and several of the tev sources are unidentified without counterparts at lower energies .",
    "however , the improved localizations of hess have led to identification of supernova remnants ( snr)@xcite , pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) , and molecular clouds @xcite as emitters of tev gamma rays .    in the milagro data , four sources ( including the crab )",
    "are detected with post - trials significance greater than 4@xmath9 , and four additional lower significance candidates are identified .",
    "six of these eight tev excesses are coincident with the locations of egret sources .",
    "many of these sources have stringent upper limits at tev energies , such as those from the whipple observatory @xcite . however , these upper limits weaken for extended sources by the ratio of the radius of the source to the angular resolution . the angular resolution of milagro is approximately an order of magnitude larger than acts , but is less than half that of egret , resulting in little reduction in sensitivity for sources up to @xmath10 diameter",
    "the tev flux , spatial morphology , and potential counterparts of these new sources are discussed below .",
    "the analysis was performed on 2358 days of data collected by milagro during the operational period from july 19 , 2000 through jan 1 , 2007 .",
    "data from the last 3 years of operation were collected after the completion of the outrigger array , which substantially increased the sensitivity of milagro , particularly at high energies .",
    "the milagro data were analyzed using the method described in @xcite , in which the events are weighted based on the gamma / hadron separation parameter ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the signal and background maps are smoothed with the point spread function ( psf ) , which varies based on the number of hits in the events .",
    "the statistical significance of the excess or deficit is computed using eqn .",
    "17 in @xcite .",
    "the milagro detector is located at latitude @xmath12",
    "n , where the galactic center and the central galactic bulge are outside the field of view . in this survey of the northern galactic plane , only events with zenith angle less than @xmath13 are included , which covers declinations north of @xmath14 . in galactic coordinates ,",
    "this region is longitude @xmath2 $ ] and latitude @xmath3 $ ] , which subtends 9.2% of the entire sky and covers more than half of the galactic plane .",
    "the energy threshold and sensitivity of milagro vary with zenith angle .",
    "table 1 shows the median energy and relative sensitivity of the instrument as a function of declination for an assumed differential photon power law spectrum of spectral index @xmath15 .",
    "the background at a given location in celestial coordinates is found use the method described in @xcite with the modification that the events are weighted .",
    "the signal map is searched for excesses over the background map with a statistical significance @xmath1 . when a source candidate is found , the region in the vicinity of the candidate is removed to prevent double counting , and the search is repeated . with this automated procedure ,",
    "two nearby sources may be identified as a single source candidate or a single extended source may be broken up into multiple candidates .",
    "the event excess in the vicinity of each source candidate is fit to a two - dimensional gaussian to determine the location , spatial extent and flux . the average angular resolution .",
    "] of these weighted events is @xmath16 and has been measured with observations of the crab .",
    "astrophysical sources are better described by a top hat function than a gaussian ; however , a gaussian approximates a top hat of less than a few degrees diameter that is convolved with the milagro psf .",
    "therefore , the gaussian sigma is used to constrain the diameter of the top hat function that best fits the angular extent of the source .",
    "the excess above the assumed isotropic background is calculated from the volume of the fit two - dimensional gaussian .",
    "this calculation results in a larger uncertainty than implied by the significance of the detection , but properly accounts for the flux of extended sources .",
    "the excess is converted to a flux with a monte carlo simulation of extensive air showers using corsika @xcite and of the milagro detector using geant4 @xcite .",
    "the source fluxes are computed assuming a differential photon spectrum of a power law with spectral index @xmath15 with no cutoff .",
    "this is the average spectrum for galactic sources observed by hess @xcite .",
    "the flux is quoted at 20 tev , which is approximately the median energy of the gamma rays from the sources detected by milagro , as seen in table 1 .",
    "the median energy of milagro varies with source spectra and declination , however the uncertainty in the flux at 20 tev is relatively insensitive to the assumed spectrum and varies by only @xmath17 when @xmath18 varies from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "figure [ fig : galactic_plane ] shows a psf - smoothed map of the galactic plane , with the color scale indicating the statistical significance of the milagro excess or deficit at each point .",
    "table [ tab : galactic_sources ] gives the locations , fluxes , statistical significances , angular extents , and counterparts for the eight source candidates identified with a pre - trials significance in the psf - smoothed map of @xmath1 . because several of the candidates are extended beyond the psf of milagro , the maximum pre - trials significance for a search with a larger bin of size @xmath21 is also given in table [ tab : galactic_sources ] .",
    "however , the post - trials significances are not based on this _ a posteriori _ observation , but are calculated from the psf - smoothed pre - trials significances .",
    "a monte carlo simulation is used to account for the trials involved in searching this 3800 square degree region .",
    "this simulation predicts that 4% of such searches would result in at least one source with @xmath22 pre - trials significance anywhere in the region due to background fluctuation .",
    "the list of eight candidates includes the crab and mrgo 2019 + 37 , which was previously reported @xcite .",
    "excluding these previously known gamma - ray sources , six new candidates are identified .",
    "the two most significant of these , mgro j1908 + 06 and mgro j2031 + 41 , exceed @xmath23 after accounting for trials .",
    "therefore , the four most significant sources in table 1 are considered definitive tev gamma - ray source detections .",
    "the remaining four source candidates , labeled as c1-c4 , have post - trials significances less than @xmath23 and are regarded as lower confidence detections .    the non - isotropic galactic diffuse gamma - ray background will contribute to the observed flux of a source .",
    "diffuse emission is particularly bright in the cygnus region , where five of the eight candidate sources are located .",
    "the galprop model @xcite predicts that the tev gamma - ray diffuse emission flux is 3 to 7 times lower than the observed flux in the large cygnus region defined as @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath8$]@xcite . for individual sources near high concentrations of matter , the diffuse emission will be a larger fraction of the quoted flux .",
    "however , due to uncertainties in the model predictions , the diffuse emission was not subtracted from the source fluxes .",
    "the * crab nebula * , a standard reference source for tev astronomy , is detected at 15.0@xmath9 .",
    "the flux derived from the milagro data is consistent , within errors , with the flux results obtained from atmospheric cherenkov telescopes @xcite .",
    "the fit location is @xmath25 from the pulsar location , which is consistent with the statistical error .",
    "* mgro j2019 + 37 * is one of five milagro sources in the cygnus region of the galactic plane .",
    "it is the most significant source detection by milagro after the crab and was discussed in depth in @xcite .",
    "more data have been analyzed since the publication of that paper , so the flux and significance in table [ tab : galactic_sources ] have been updated .",
    "* mgro j1908 + 06 * is observed with a pre - trials significance of 8.3@xmath9 , with a flux that is @xmath080% of the crab flux .",
    "this location is the closest of the eight candidates to the inner galaxy , where the diffuse emission is expected to increase .",
    "this source is coincident with gev j1907 + 0557 and with the bright radio , shell - type , snr g40.5 - 0.5@xcite .",
    "gev j1097 + 0557 was observed for 87 hours by the hegra tev observatory , resulting in an upper limit for a point source of 2.6% of the crab flux at 700 gev .",
    "the milagro data are consistent both with a point source and with an extended source with diameter up to @xmath26 .",
    "the milagro data are consistent both with a point source and with an extended source of diameter up 2.6@xmath27 .",
    "the milagro flux and hegra upper limit taken together imply a harder spectrum than other galactic sources detected in this energy range by hess .",
    "however , if the source is extended , the hegra upper limit would be increased , allowing for a spectrum typical of other tev sources .",
    "the tibet air shower observatory has a similar energy threshold and angular resolution as milagro , and reports a location within @xmath28 of * mgro j1908 + 06 * as one of eight locations in their survey of the northern hemisphere sky that is above 4.5@xmath9@xcite .",
    "* mgro j2031 + 41 * is observed with a pre - trials significance of 6.6@xmath9 and is located in the area with the largest concentration of molecular and atomic gas in the cygnus region .",
    "its location is consistent with egret sources gev j2035 + 4214 and 3eg j2033 + 4118 and with tev j2032 + 413 .",
    "the flux of tev j2032 + 413 is measured up to @xmath010 tev , and is only about one third of the milagro flux when extrapolated to 20 tev . the low energy counterpart for tev j2032 + 413 is unclear , but several possibilities have recently been postulated @xcite .",
    "the spatial extent of the milagro detection , at @xmath29 , is much larger than the few arcminute extent of tev j2032 + 413 .",
    "there must be another source or sources contributing to the milagro excess .",
    "there are two source candidates in the cygnus region  *",
    "c1 * and * c2 *  that are less significant and have no obvious egret , pwn , or snr counterparts . * c1 * is located farthest from the galactic plane at b = @xmath30 .",
    "* c2 * may be an extension of * mgro j2019 + 37 * but is @xmath31 away . * c2 * is not well fit by a two dimensional gaussian . for this source , the bin in the psf - smoothed map with the highest excess",
    "is used to determine the best location , and the flux is obtained from the excess in a @xmath32 angular bin .",
    "* c3 * is positionally consistent with geminga , which is the brightest egret source in the northern hemisphere sky .",
    "geminga is a pulsar that is only 160 pc away and is @xmath0300,000 years old @xcite .",
    "the 5.1@xmath9 source detected by milagro is consistent with the pulsar location and is extended with a diameter of @xmath33 .",
    "the significance increases to @xmath34 in a @xmath35 bin .",
    "the significance of the milagro excess at the location of the pulsar is 4.9@xmath9 in the psf - smoothed map .",
    "only pulsed emission was detected by egret , but a pwn has been observed in x - rays @xcite that delineates the bow shock created by the pulsar s motion .",
    "the diameter of the excess implies an @xmath36 pc source extent , which is consistent with the observations by hess of more distant pwn .",
    "upper limits on the tev flux from geminga of @xmath37 mcrab assumed the emission was from a point source and were set at a much lower energy than this observation .",
    "if the spectral index is @xmath38 or harder , or if the source is extended , the milagro detection is consistent with the previously reported limits .",
    "* c4 * is the least significant source in table [ tab : galactic_sources ] at 5.0@xmath9 .",
    "however , as seen in figure 1 , the source appears very elongated and the significance increases to @xmath39 with the larger @xmath21 bin .",
    "the source location is consistent with 3eg j2227 + 6122 , gev j2227 + 6106 , and the snr g106.6 + 2.9 with the accompanying boomerang pwn .",
    "this pwn is predicted by @xcite to be the third brightest tev pwn in the northern sky , surpassed only by the crab and pwn g75.2 + 0.1 , which both have high significance milagro counterparts .",
    "a survey of @xmath40 of the galactic plane at @xmath6 tev has been performed with milagro with a sensitivity from 3 to 6 @xmath41 ( tev@xmath42@xmath43s@xmath44 .",
    "eight sources are identified with @xmath1 pre - trials significance above the isotropic cosmic ray background .",
    "all four of the high confidence sources and two of the lower significance candidates are associated with egret gev sources , of which there are only 14 in the search region .",
    "four of these six sources appear extended , and the significance of the other two lower significance sources increases substantially with a larger bin of size @xmath35 .",
    "the significance for a true point source would be expected to decrease slowly for larger bin sizes due to the addition of gamma rays beyond the edge of the optimal bin . on the other hand",
    ", the significance of a statistical fluctuation of background would be expected to decrease inversely proportional to the bin radius .",
    "the remaining two lower confidence source candidates are within the cygnus region , where the diffuse emission is high and there is a large concentration of egret sources .",
    "the differential photon spectrum that connects the fluxes observed by egret at 1 gev with those observed at 20 tev by milagro is described by a power law with spectral index @xmath45 , except for geminga which is steeper .",
    "this spectrum implies a break from the harder spectra observed for most of these sources by egret above 100 mev .",
    "four of these sources are associated with pwne , of which only 11 are known in this region @xcite , and one is associated with a snr .",
    "other members of these classes of sources have also been detected by hess .",
    "the angular extents of the milagro sources are large , as would be expected if the sources are nearby , like geminga .",
    "the enhanced sensitivity of glast should allow these objects to be resolved at energies above a few gev .",
    "in addition , a milagro energy spectrum analysis is being developed that will measure spectra of these sources up to 50 tev .",
    "the morphology at different energies provides important clues about the energy of the particles producing the radiation and the energy loss mechanisms of these particles .",
    "combining spatial resolution over a broad range of energies is key to understanding the galactic sources that emit the highest energy gamma rays .",
