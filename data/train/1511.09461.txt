    "an outstanding result of modern cosmology is that a significant fraction of the universe is made of dark matter .",
    "however , the nature of such component is still unknown , apart its gravitational interaction with ordinary baryonic matter .",
    "a favored candidate for dark matter is the axion : a new particle introduced by peccei and quinn to solve the strong cp problem @xcite , i.e. the absence of cp violation in the strong interaction sector of the standard model .",
    "axions have properties similar to a @xmath0 particle and have mass @xmath1 inversely proportional to the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking scale @xmath2 . for certain ranges of @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( typically with masses ranging from @xmath3ev to mev ) , large quantities of axions may had been produced in the early universe that could be able to account for a large portion of the cold dark matter forming today galactic halos .",
    "axions have extremely small coupling to normal matter and radiation , but they can be converted into detectable photons by means of the inverse primakoff effect as shown by sikivie @xcite .",
    "the idea of sikivie has been exploited by the several experiments @xcite , of which the most recent is admx @xcite .",
    "the latter experiment is still running , and for the moment it has been capable of exploring the axion model for masses of a few @xmath3ev .",
    "the quax ( quaerere axion ) proposal explores in details the ideas of krauss @xcite , barbieri et al @xcite , and kolokolov and vorobyev @xcite .",
    "these authors proposed to study the interaction of the cosmological axion with the spin of fermions ( electrons or nucleons ) .",
    "in fact , due to the motion of the solar system through the galactic halo , the earth is effectively moving through the cold dark matter cloud surrounding the galaxy and an observer on earth will see such axions as a wind .",
    "in particular , the effect of the axion wind on a magnetized material can be described as an effective oscillating rf field with frequency determined by @xmath1 , and amplitude related to @xmath2 .",
    "thus , a possible detector for the axion wind can be a magnetized sample with larmor resonance frequency tuned to the axion mass by means of an external polarizing static field ( e.g. 0.6 t for 17 ghz , corresponding to a 70 @xmath3ev axion mass ) . the interaction with the axion effective field will drive the total magnetization of the sample , and so producing oscillations in the magnetization that , in principle , can be detected . in order to optimize the detection , a pump rf field is applied in a direction orthogonal to the polarizing field . due to the non linearity of bloch equations in magnetized materials ,",
    "a pump field applied to a suitable magnetized sample , ( e.g. a small yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) sphere ) can amplify the equivalent rf field generated by the axion wind .",
    "the induced change in the magnetic flux along the polarizing field is then fed to a squid magnetometer through a superconducting transformer .",
    "it is worth noticing that the magnetized sample must be cooled to ultra - cryogenic temperature to avoid fluctuations of the magnetization due to the thermal bath .",
    "the quax collaboration is exploring the experimental feasibility of the proposed detection scheme , starting at a precise value of the axion mass of about 70 @xmath3ev .",
    "the quax r&d activities are conducted at the laboratori nazionali di legnaro ( lnl ) of the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare ( infn ) , and funded in the framework of the research call _",
    "what next _ of infn .",
    "we are building a prototype detector to study its sensitivity , intrinsic and technical noises , and demonstrate the possibility to reach the signal level corresponding to the axion coupling constant as predicted by the theoretical model .",
    "let s start from the well known lagrangian which describes the interaction of 1/2 spin particle with the axion field @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath4 are the spinor field of the fermion with mass @xmath7 and the axion field with dimension of momentum , respectively ; here @xmath8 are the 4 dirac matrices , @xmath9 , and @xmath4 is coupled to the matter by the pseudo - scalar coupling constant @xmath10 . by obtaining the euler - lagrange equation and in the non relativistic limit",
    ", the time evolution of a 1/2 spin particles can be described by the usual schroedinger equation @xmath11\\varphi\\ , \\ ] ] where the most relevant interaction term @xmath12 has the form of the interaction between the spin magnetic moment of a fermion ( @xmath13 with @xmath14 the bohr magneton ) and an effective magnetic field @xmath15 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the axion field couples to fermions as a pseudo - scalar field ; in fact , @xmath16 is a pseudo - vector ( like the magnetic field ) and @xmath17 is a true scalar interaction term .",
    "axions represent the best example of non - thermal dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "the expected dark matter density is @xmath18 mev/@xmath19 , and we will suppose that axion is the dominant component . as the axion mass should be in the range @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 axions per cubic centimeter which is a remarkably high density number .",
    "the axion velocities @xmath22 are distributed according to a maxwellian distribution ( the non relativistic limit of the bose - einstein distribution ) , with a velocity dispersion @xmath23 km / sec .",
    "due to galaxy rotation and earth motions in the solar system , the rest frame of an earth based laboratory is moving through the local axion cloud with a time varying velocity @xmath24 , where @xmath25 represents the sun velocity in the galactic rest frame ( magnitude 230 km / sec ) , @xmath26 is the earth s orbital velocity around the sun ( magnitude 29.8 km / sec ) , and @xmath27 the earth s rotational velocity ( magnitude 0.46 km / sec ) .",
    "the observed axion velocity is then @xmath28 .",
    "the effect of this motion is to broaden the maxwell distribution , as well as to modulate it with a periodicity of one sidereal day and one sidereal year .",
    "axions kinetic energy is expected to be distributed with a mean relative to the rest mass @xmath29 and a dispersion about the mean @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the inverse of this last number represent the natural figure of merit of the axion linewidth , @xmath31 .",
    "the mean de broglie wavelength of an axion is @xmath32 m , therefore @xmath33 is much greater than the typical length of experimental apparatus , in our case the magnetized samples .",
    "such theoretical and experimental aspects allow us to treat @xmath4 as a classical field that interacts coherently with fermions with a mean value @xmath34 $ ] where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the field amplitude .",
    "the amplitude @xmath37 can be easily computed by equating the moment transported by this field per unit of volume ( i.e. the associated energy momentum tensor @xmath38 ) to the number of axion per unit volume times the average momentum ( i.e. @xmath39 ) , and it reads @xmath40 . to calculate the effective magnetic field associated with the mean axion field we multiply the gradient @xmath41 by @xmath42 and take the real part @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath45 is the land g - factor for elementary fermions . in the framework of dfsz model of axions@xcite , the value of the coupling constant @xmath10 with electrons can be calculated and expressed in terms of the @xmath46 mass and decay constant @xmath47 and @xmath48 as @xmath49 where we have used @xmath50 for the electron mass .",
    "putting the magnetized samples in @xmath51 , we have that the equivalent oscillating rf field along the @xmath52 direction has a mean amplitude and central frequency @xmath53 with a relative linewidth @xmath54 .",
    "to detect an extremely small rf field we will exploit the electron spin resonance ( esr ) in a magnetized media . in particular , we have to recourse to the continuous wave esr in a magnetic material using a coil oriented along the polarizing field direction .",
    "this method is known as longitudinal detection scheme ( lod ) , and during the last decades it was investigated systematically , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .    a magnetized spherical sample of volume @xmath55 and magnetization @xmath56 is placed in the bore of a solenoid , which generates a static magnetic field @xmath57 ( polarizing field ) .",
    "the value @xmath57 determines the larmor frequency of the electrons , and so the axion mass under scrutiny , through the relation @xmath58 then , an additional radio frequency field @xmath59 is applied to the sample in a direction orthogonal to @xmath60 , that we suppose along the @xmath61 axis . as the radiofrequency field is in the @xmath62 plane",
    ", it can drive the magnetic resonance causing the electron spin to flip between the two zeeman sublevels .",
    "we do nt need the quantum formalism as the rf field amplitude is sufficiently large to drive a macroscopic number of spins .",
    "the evolution of magnetization @xmath63 of the sample is described by the bloch equations with dissipations and radiation damping @xcite @xmath64    where @xmath56 is the static magnetization directed along the @xmath61 axis , @xmath65 is the radiation damping time , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the longitudinal ( or spin - lattice ) and transverse ( or spin - spin ) relaxation time , respectively .",
    "the non linear terms proportional to @xmath68 were introduced by bloom in 1957 to account for electromotive force induced in the rf coils of the driving circuit by magnetization changes without taking into account the dynamics of the rf coils . in this case",
    "@xmath69 , where the filling factor @xmath70 and the quality factor @xmath71 account for geometrical coupling of coil and magnetized sample and circuit dissipations , respectively .    in the higher frequency regime , which is our case , @xmath72 , radiation damping",
    "is dominated by magnetic dipole emission in free space from the magnetized sample , and the relaxation time reduces to @xmath73 .",
    "the steady state solutions of eq.([bloch ] ) in the presence of radiation damping and for various approximations are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . a new relaxation time is introduced @xmath74 .",
    "let us suppose that the rf field is linearly polarized and a linear superposition of the equivalent field @xmath75 , due to the axions , and a pump field @xmath76 , with amplitude @xmath77 .",
    "we assume also that the axion field direction is parallel to the direction of @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , the axion and pump frequencies @xmath79 and @xmath80 are within the linewidth of the larmor resonance of the magnetized sample , i.e. ( @xmath81 and ( @xmath82 . in this way",
    ", the larmor frequency of electrons is driven by the rf field @xmath83    due to the non - linearity of the bloch s equations , as a result of this _ amplitude modulated _ rf field , a variable magnetization is produced along the @xmath61-axis .",
    "in fact , the stationary solution for @xmath84 in eq.([bloch ] ) can be used even in quasi - stationary regimes @xcite , provided that @xmath85 . at the beat note between the two field components we have @xmath86 where we have defined the detection frequency @xmath87 and assumed @xmath88 .",
    "such low frequency oscillations of the magnetization can be detected with suitable devices , e.g. a squid amplifier . in this detection scheme",
    "we can choose the best detection frequency for increasing the signal to noise ratio , and we can use amplifiers that could not work at very high frequencies . moreover , the effective rf field @xmath89 is down converted to a low frequency field with amplitude @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the transduction gain , and it is given by @xmath92 if we assume that the relaxation times satisfy @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the transduction gain will depend only on @xmath65 : @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the wavelength corresponding to the larmor frequency . thus to obtain a gain @xmath97 in free space , the sample volume must satisfy the inequality @xmath98 . on the other hand , the pump field amplitude must be far from saturation @xmath99 , which implies @xmath100 .",
    "this is the reason why we ca nt get @xmath97 in free space with realistic sample volumes and pumping fields .",
    "inside an rf cavity , this problem could be solved but the thermal noise in the hybridized system formed by cavity and magnetized sample is much greater than the axion equivalent field . the solution is to detect axions by placing the sample in a waveguide with a cutoff frequency @xmath101 above the larmor frequency of the sample .",
    "for instance , we can place the sample at a distance @xmath102 from the aperture of a rectangular waveguide of cross section @xmath103 .",
    "the lowest cut - off frequency for an open waveguide @xmath104 is given by ( the waveguide behaves as a high pass filter ) : @xmath105 .",
    "due to boundary conditions , if the larmor frequency is lower than @xmath101 , the magnetic resonant mode can not propagate inside the waveguide , but only evanescent waves can exist .",
    "we expect then a reduction of the radiation damping mechanism for the selected magnetic resonance . the advantage of this experimental configuration is twofold : i )",
    "relaxation times are no longer dominated by radiation damping but by the intrinsic relaxation times of the sample @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; and ii ) the noise associated to thermal photons is greatly reduced .",
    "the main difference with the case of a microwave cavity is that we exploit the non - radiative field to pump energy in the sample by means of a rf coil placed around the sample itself .",
    "we are interested in fluctuations of the magnetization of the sample .",
    "there are at least four sources of noise to consider : a ) pump field noise ; b ) noise at the axion frequency due to thermal photons that can be down converted after interaction with the pump field ; c ) magnetization noise generated by sample that can either be down converted by the pump or can act as a noise source in the low frequency readout ; d ) noise associated with the squid pickup at the readout frequency .",
    "a preliminary evaluation of these noise sources shows that the most challenging issue is related with the pump field noise .",
    "all the noises are in the process of being carefully evaluated .    in addition to these noise sources , we have to take into account any relaxation process that can be active at the readout frequency and can induce fluctuations in the z component of magnetization .",
    "the presence of such processes and their magnitude has to be directly measured on the magnetized sample .",
