    "the properties of such a three - component spinor condensate were first studied using mean - field theories ( mft ) @xcite and polar and ferromagnetic spinor condensates had been implemented experimentally @xcite .",
    "it was initially predicted that the ground state of @xmath4na bec ( @xmath5 ) is either polar ( @xmath6 ) or anti - ferromagnetic ( @xmath7 in the mean - field theory .",
    "however , the results from many body theory @xcite pointed out that the ground state of @xmath4na atoms is a spin singlet with properties drastically different from those of mean field theories ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the singlet ground state in zero field is a fragmented condensate with anomalously large number fluctuations ( @xmath9 ) and thus has fragile stability .",
    "the exact quantum eigenstates in the spin-2 case @xcite are also found and their magnetic response to a weak magnetic field is compared with their mean field counterpart @xcite .",
    "mixtures of scalar condensates with more than one atomic species or state are actively studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the feshbach resonance has exploited to create a double species condensate with tunable interactions and the dynamics of the superfluid and controllable phase separation are observed myatt , modugno , thalhammer , papp . by adjusting the two s - wave scattering lengths @xmath10 and @xmath11 through the so - called optical feshbach resonances @xcite , the spin exchange interaction between individual atoms can be precisely tuned .",
    "the theoretical studies on mixtures of spinor condensates attracted much attention recently and both mean field and quantum many body theories have been applied to this novel system @xcite .",
    "a temporal modulation of spin exchange interaction , which is tunable with optical feshbach resonance , was recently proposed to localize the spin mixing dynamics in a @xmath12rb condensate @xcite .",
    "the interspecies scattering parameters between @xmath12rb and @xmath4na are calculated resorting to the simple approach of the degenerate internal - state approximation ( dia ) @xcite as the low - energy atomic interactions can be mostly attributed to the ground - state configurations of the two valence electrons .",
    "the interspecies scattering lengths for singlet and triplet electronic states are approximately determined already dia1,dia2 , given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath10 is the bohr radius .",

    "however , for the more general case of an arbitrary mixture of spin-1 condensate , the hyperfine interaction between nuclear spin and electron spin gives in general non - neglegible interspecies pairing and dia approximation is not applicable @xcite . in this paper , we first study the various quantum phases of the binary mixture of spin-1 condensates in the ground state ignoring the interspecies singlet pairing .",
    "then the situation with competition between intra- and inter - species singlet pairings is considered . using the full quantum approach of exact diagonalization",

    "we take the intra - condensate atomic interaction in the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 for the two species and the inter - species interaction is described as @xmath23 in contrast to intra - condensate interactions between identical atoms luo , xu09 , the collision between atoms belonging to different species can occur in the total spin @xmath24 channel , which makes the mixture more interesting .",

    "so when these two kinds of atoms are mixed together , the polar atoms are more easier to be influenced , but their back action on to the stable ferromagnetic atoms is negligible .",

    "an interesting observation is that for large and negative ( positive ) value of parameter @xmath163 the system enters the same phase ff ( aa ) , no matter how the atoms interact inside each species .",
