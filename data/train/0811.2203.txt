    "complex systems consisting of large number of highly interconnected dynamic units , whose structure is usually irregular have been the subject of intense research efforts in the past few years @xcite .",
    "the complexity of such systems is reflected not only in their structure but also in their dynamics .",
    "the usual representation of a wide range of systems of this kind in nature and society uses networks as the concept appropriate for the study of both the topology and dynamics of complex systems .",
    "the usual approach to study networks is via graph theory which was well developed for regular and random graphs both of which have been found to be exceptional cases of limited use in real world realizations and applications .",
    "recently , along with the discovery of new types of network structures such as the small - world @xcite and scale - free networks @xcite , the tools of statistical mechanics have been successfully implemented offering explanations and insights into the the newly recognized properties of these systems . in spite of many advances based on statistical mechanics approaches to various issues involving networks , from biology to social sciences",
    ", it is our opinion that there is a need for more versatile approach which would rely on new topological methods either separately or in combination with the techniques of statistical mechanics . in particular",
    ", the program is to encode the network into a simplicial complex which may be considered as a combinatorial version of a topological space whose properties may now be studied from combinatorial , topological or algebraic aspects .",
    "the motivation stems from the q - analysis introduced by r. atkin @xcite , @xcite who advocated its use in various areas of physics and social systems analysis in the 70 s .",
    "the methods of q - analysis were extended further into a combinatorial homotopy theory , called a - theory @xcite .",
    "consequently , the invariants of simplicial complexes may be defined from three different points of view ( combinatorial , topological or algebraic ) and each one of them provides completely different measures of the complex and , by extension , of the graph ( network ) from which the complex was constructed . in @xcite , for several standard types of networks we constructed vector valued quantities representing topological and algebraic invariants and showed , among other issues , that their statistical properties perfectly match their corresponding degree distributions .",
    "such an approach provided a link between topological properties of simplicial complexes and statistical mechanics of networks from which simplicial complexes were constructed .    in the present exposition we focus on simplicial complexes ( obtained from random , scale- free networks and networks with exponential conectivity distributions ) and their homological properties . in most general terms ,",
    "algebraic topology offers two methods for gauging the global properties of a particular topological space @xmath0 by associating with it a collection of algebraic objects .",
    "the first set of invariants are the _ homotopy groups _",
    "@xmath1 @xmath2 the first one ( i.e. for @xmath3 ) , known as the fundamental homotopy group being well known .",
    "homotopy groups contain information on the number and kind of ways one can map a @xmath4-dimensional sphere @xmath5 into @xmath0 , with two spheres in @xmath0 considered equivalent if they are homotopic ( belonging to a same path equivalence class ) relative to some fixed basepoint .",
    "computational demands of such an approach are in general extremely high and for that reason the second set of invariants , the _ homology groups , _ is of more practical interest .",
    "homology groups of dimension @xmath4 , @xmath6 , provide information about properties of chains formed from simple oriented units known as simplices .",
    "the elements of homology groups are cycles ( chains with vanishing boundary ) and two @xmath4-cycles are considered homologous if their difference is the boundary of @xmath7-chain . in more general terms @xmath6 determines the number of @xmath4-dimensional subspaces of @xmath0 which have no boundary in @xmath0 and themselves are not boundary of any @xmath8-dimensional subspace .",
    "in contrast to homotopy groups , homology groups can be computed using the methods of linear algebra and the ease of these methods are counterbalanced by obtained topological resolution .",
    "it should be remarked that these computations can be quite time consuming in spite of recent advances in computational techniques mishaikow .",
    "although homology groups are computable and provide insight into topological spaces and maps between them , our interest is in discerning which topological features are essential and which can be safely ignored , similar to signal processing procedure when signal is removed from noise .",
    "one of the important informations about the topological space is the number and type of holes it contains and going beyond standard homological approaches one could be interested in finding out which holes are essential and which are unimportant .",
    "this is the subject of persistence and persistent homology , as introduced by edelsbrunner , letscher and zomorodian @xcite , whose aim is to extract long - lived topological features ( topological signal ) which persist over a certain parameter range and which are contrasted with short - lived features ( topological noise ) .    with networks encoded into simplicial complexes we are interested in topological features which persist over a sequence of simplicial complexes of different sizes .",
    "this sequence reflects the formation of the network or the change of the existing network when new node or nodes are introduced or removed .",
    "here we focus on recognizing persistent and non persistent features of random , modular and non modular scale - free networks and networks with exponential connectivity distribution . in the following exposition",
    "our main topic will be homology and although it is self contained an elementary knowledge of homology would be helpfull , as may be found for example in chapter 2 of @xcite . our main motivation is to show that each of these different types of networks have different persistent homological properties although here we do not attempt to present these features as generic .",
    "moreover , long - lived topological attributes reveal new and important information related to connectivity of the network which could not be inferred using any other conventional methods .",
    "the outline of the exposition is as follows : in section 2 we review concepts from algebra and simplicial homology while in section 3 we present the methods of constructing simplicial complexes from graphs . in section 4",
    "we introduce the concept of persistent homology and discuss computational aspects .",
    "section 5 contains description of graphical representation of persistent homology groups . in section 6",
    "we present the results of persistent homology calculations for random networks while in section 7 and 8 persistent homologies are determined for networks with exponential degree distribution and three types of scale - free networks respectively .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 9 .",
    "any subset of @xmath9 @xmath10 determines an @xmath11-@xmath12 denoted by @xmath13 the elements @xmath14 of @xmath15 are the vertices of the simplex denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the dimension of the simplex .",
    "any set of simplices with vertices in @xmath15 is called a simplicial family and its dimension is the largest dimension of its simplices .",
    "a @xmath18-simplex @xmath19 is a @xmath18-face of an @xmath17-simplex @xmath20 , denoted by @xmath21 , if every vertex of @xmath22 is also a vertex of @xmath23 a simplicial complex represents a collection of simplices .",
    "more formally , a simplicial complex @xmath24 on a finite set @xmath25 of vertices is a nonempty subset of the power set of @xmath15 , so that the simplicial complex @xmath24 is closed under the formation of subsets .",
    "hence , if @xmath26 and @xmath27.@xmath28 @xmath29 then @xmath30.@xmath31    two simplices @xmath32 and @xmath27 are @xmath33 if there is a sequence of simplices @xmath34 such that any two consecutive ones share a @xmath18-face,.implying that they have at least @xmath35 vertices in common . such a chain is called a @xmath18-chain .",
    "the complex @xmath24 is @xmath18-connected if any two simplices in @xmath24 of dimensionality greater or equal to @xmath18 are @xmath18-connected .",
    "the dimension of a simplex @xmath36 is equal to the number of vertices defining it minus one .",
    "the dimension of the simplicial complex @xmath24 is the maximum of the dimensions of the simplices comprising @xmath24 . in fig .",
    "1 we show an example of a simplicial complex and its matrix representation .",
    "in this example @xmath37 } , and the simplicial complex @xmath24 consists of the subsets @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "its dimension is @xmath40 , as there is a @xmath40-dimensional simplex , in addition to two @xmath41-dimensional ones , two @xmath42-dimensional and one @xmath43-dimensional simplex .",
    "a convenient way to represent a simplicial complex is via a so called incidence matrix , whose columns are labeled by its vertices and whose rows are labeled by its simplices , as shown also in fig .",
    "1 . the multifaceted property ( algebraic , topological and combinatorial ) of simplicial complexes makes them particularly convenient for modelling complex structures and connectedness between different substructures .",
    "chains and cycles are simplicial analogs of paths and loops in the continuous domain .",
    "the set of all @xmath4-chains together with the operation of addition forms a group @xmath44 .",
    "a collection of @xmath45-dimensional faces of a @xmath4-simplex @xmath29 itself a @xmath45-chain , is the boundary @xmath46 of @xmath47 the boundary of @xmath4-chain is the sum of the boundaries of the simplices in the chain .",
    "the boundary operator @xmath48 is a homomorphism @xmath49 and @xmath50 s for @xmath51 connect the chain groups into a chain complex,@xmath52 with @xmath53 for all @xmath4 .",
    "the kernel of @xmath50 is the set of @xmath4-chains with empty boundary while a @xmath4-cycle , denoted by @xmath54 , is a @xmath4-chain in the kernel of @xmath55 the image of @xmath56 is the set of @xmath45-chains which are boundaries of @xmath4-chains with a @xmath4-boundary , denoted by @xmath57 , being a @xmath4-chain in the image of @xmath58@xmath59the collection of @xmath54 s and @xmath57 s together with addition form subgroups of @xmath44 while the property @xmath60 shows that @xmath61 i.e. these groups are nested as illustrated in figure 2 .      the @xmath4-th homology group is@xmath62    if @xmath63 , @xmath64 then the difference between @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the boundary and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are homologous .",

    "since a non - bounding @xmath73-cycle represents the set of components of complex @xmath74 , there is one basis element per component so that consequently @xmath75 represents the number of components of @xmath24 .",

    "each tunnel can be represented as a sum of tunnels from the basis so that @xmath79 represents the dimension of the basis for the tunnels .",
    "these tunnels may be perceived as forming graph with cycles @xcite . a @xmath80-cycle which itself is not a boundary represents the set of non - contractable closed surfaces in @xmath24 , or based on duality principle , a set of voids which exist in the complement of the simplicial complex , i.e. @xmath81 the dimension of the basis for voids , equal to the number of voids",
    "is represented by @xmath82",
    "simplicial complexes may be constructed from undirected or directed graphs ( digraphs ) in several different ways .",
    "here we only consider two of them : the neighborhood complex and the clique complex .",
    "the neighborhood complex _ _ n__@xmath83 is constructed from the graph @xmath84 , with vertices @xmath85 in such a way that for each vertex @xmath86 of @xmath84 there is a simplex containing the vertex @xmath86 , along with all vertices @xmath87 corresponding to directed edges @xmath88 the neighborhood complex is obtained by including all faces of those simplices and in terms of matrix representation , the incidence matrix is obtained from the adjacency matrix of @xmath84 by increasing all diagonal entries by @xmath43 .",
    "an example of the construction of a neighborhood complex is represented in fig . @xmath41 .",
    "the clique complex @xmath89 has the complete subgraphs as simplices and the vertices of @xmath84 as its vertices so that it is essentially the complete subgraph complex .",
    "the maximal simplices are given by the collection of vertices that make up the cliques of @xmath84 .",
    "in literature , a clique complex is also referred to as flag complex .",
    "an example of a clique complex is presented in fig .",
    "4 .    these two methods are not the only ones that may be used for constructing simplicial complexes from graphs .",
    "actually , any property of the graph @xmath84 that is preserved under deletion of vertices or edges may be used for construction purposes .",
    "a detailed account of the methods for obtaining simplicial complexes from graphs , among many other issues related to the relationship between graphs and simplicial complexes , may be found in johnss .",
    "the basic aim of persistent homology @xcite is to measure life - time of certain topological properties of a simplicial complex when simplices are added to the complex or removed from it .",
    "usually the evolution of the complex considers its creation starting from the empty set , hence the assumption is that simplices are added to the complex ( corresponding to the growing network ) .",
    "the sequence of subcomplexes constructed in the process is known as filtration . in more formal terms",
    "the filtration of the simplicial complex @xmath24 is a sequence of complexes @xmath90 , such that:@xmath91the simplices in @xmath24 are indexed by their rank in a filtration sequence and each prefix of the sequence is a subcomplex .",
    "two filtration constructions are usually considered when the history of the complex is studied .",
    "the first one is formed when at each stage of the filtration only one simplex is added ( i.e. @xmath92 consists of one simplex @xmath93 for each @xmath94 ) . in the second case",
    "a simplex @xmath93 is added to the sequence , say to subcomplex @xmath95 , when all its faces are already parts of some @xmath90 @xmath96 hence , the second case does not require only one simplex to be added at each stage of filtration .",
    "these two filtrations contain complete orderings of its simplices and figure 5 illustrates the two progressive sequences .",
    "naturally , other filtrations may also be applied in practice including `` irregular '' ones when simplices are removed or disappear in the sequence . for these filtrations the main aspect of change is not only growth but decrease as well .      following the expositions in the pioneering paper on persistent homology @xcite and in reference",
    "@xcite we give here some basic notions and concepts .",
    "persistence is defined in conjunction with cycle and boundary groups of complexes in filtration i.e. with respect to homology groups and associated betti numbers . since homology captures equivalent classes of cycles by factoring out the boundary cycles , the focus is on the count of non - bounding cycles whose life - span lasts beyond a chosen threshold ( say represented by number @xmath97 of next complexes in the filtration sequence ) and which determine persistent or long lasting topological properties of the complex .",
    "these cycles persist through @xmath97 phases of the sequence , hence they are important . in a complementary manner",
    "our interest also lies in cycles with short life - spans which convert to boundaries during filtration .",
    "algebraically , it is relatively simple to perform the count of persistent non - bounding cycles .",
    "let @xmath98 and @xmath99 represent the @xmath4-th cycle group and the @xmath4-th boundary group , respectively , of the @xmath100-th complex @xmath101 in filtration sequence .",
    "in order to obtain the long - lasting non - bounding cycles , the @xmath4-th cycle group is factored by the @xmath4-th boundary group of the @xmath102 complex , @xmath97 complexes later in the filtration sequence .",
    "formally , the @xmath97-persistent @xmath4-th homology group of @xmath103 is @xmath104clearly @xmath105 is a group itself being an intersection of two subgroups of @xmath106 the @xmath97-persistent @xmath4-th betti number , @xmath107 of the @xmath100-th complex @xmath101 in filtration is the rank of @xmath108@xmath109hence , @xmath110 counts homological classes in the complex @xmath111 which were created during filtration in the complex @xmath101 or earlier .",
    "there is a betti number for each dimension @xmath97 and for every pair of indices @xmath112 @xmath113 to get a more intuitive illustration of persistence concept let us consider a non - bounding @xmath4-cycle created at time ( step ) @xmath94 as a consequence of the appearance of the simplex @xmath32 in the complex so that the homology class of @xmath114 is an element of @xmath115 , i.e. @xmath116\\in h_{k}^{i}.$ ] the simplex @xmath32 will be labelled as a @xmath117 simplex , or @xmath118positive simplex )",
    ". consider the appearance of another simplex @xmath119 at time @xmath120 which turns a cycle @xmath121 in @xmath116 $ ] into a boundary , so that @xmath122 this causes the decrease of the rank of the homology group since the class @xmath116 $ ] is joined with the older class of cycles .",
    "the simplex @xmath119 will be labelled as an @xmath123 simplex , @xmath124(negative simplex ) since it annihilates both @xmath121 and @xmath116 $ ] .",
    "the persistence of @xmath114 and its homology class @xmath116 $ ] is then @xmath125 . as @xmath97 increases by one step ( assuming full ordering of simplices ) , persistence of all non - bounding cycles",
    "is decreased by one so that while @xmath97 increases , negative simplices cancel positive ones which appeared earlier in the filtration .",
    "for @xmath97 large ( long enough ) , the topological noise may be removed from pertinent information about homology groups and betti numbers .",
    "high quality algorithms exists for the computation of homology groups with respect to various applications . a comprehensive introduction to the subject of computational homology is @xcite ( and the associated computational homology project chomp @xcite ) while the algorithms for persistent homology are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "various practical issues related to these algorithms and computational methods for evaluating betti numbers are covered in @xcite .",
    "the matlab - based program `` plex '' @xcite , designed for the homology analysis of point cloud data set converted into a global simplicial complex ( rips , ech or other ) offers a wealth of possibilities for various operations with simplicial complexes and simplicial homology calculations . also , a package `` simplicial homology '' @xcite , requiring `` gap '' @xcite , a system for computational discrete algebra with special emphasis on computational group theory , provides numerous functionalities related to simplicial homology .",
    "both plex and simplicial homology have been extensively used in our calculations presented here .",
    "since persistent homology represents an algebraic invariant that detects the birth and death of each topological feature as the complex evolves in time , it is advantageous to encode the persistent homology in the form of a parametrized version of the rank of homology group i.e. its betti number @xcite .",
    "one possible choice for the parameter is time as it encompasses both the case of simplex growth ( addition of simplex or simplices ) and of its decrease ( removal of simplex or simplices ) .",
    "the other choice is to use intervals whose endpoints are filtration complexes essentially representing the filtered simplicial complex at times when the addition ( or removal ) of simplices takes place . during its temporal existence , each topological attribute plays a part in the formation of some betti number and our interest lies in those properties with long lifetimes ( persistent properties ) .",
    "the parameter intervals represent lifetimes of various stages of filtration and they may be represented on the horizontal axis while arbitrary ordered homology generators @xmath71 may be represented on the vertical axis .",
    "figure 6 shows an example of filtration and the barcode for @xmath126 .",
    "the rank of persistent homology group @xmath127 equals the number of intervals in the barcode of homology group @xmath71 within the limits of the corresponding parameter range or lifetime @xmath128 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath129 may denote filtration times @xmath130 and @xmath131 or filtration complexes @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "clearly , barcodes do not provide information on delicate structure of the homology however the information about persistent parametrized rank ( since @xmath134 @xmath71 a barcode reflects the persistent properties of betti numbers ) enables clear distinction between topological noise and topological `` signal '' .",
    "for the purpose of illustrating persistent homology we first consider random ( erds - rnyi ) networks @xmath135 for which the number of nodes , @xmath136 is fixed and with each link inserted with the same probability @xmath137 as is well known , a random network has a characteristic scale in its node connectivity reflected by the peak of the distribution which corresponds to the number of nodes with the average number of links .",
    "we have constructed the clique complex @xmath89 of a random network so that the obtained complex is a random simplicial complex @xmath138 the filtration @xmath139 of the complex is @xmath140then the @xmath94-th complex in the filtration is given by@xmath141where @xmath142 is the @xmath129-th skeleton of the clique complex ( the set of simplices of dimension less or equal to @xmath129 ) .",
    "the random network considered consists of @xmath143 nodes with the probability of two nodes having a link equal to @xmath144 . the corresponding barcode is presented in fig . 7 . due to sparsity of the network",
    "the filtration steps are limited to complexes of dimension @xmath41 .",
    "it is evident that persistent @xmath78 has betti number @xmath145 @xmath146 corresponding to one line that persists through all stages of filtration .",
    "since the zero dimensional homology measures the connectivity of the underlying graph the graph is always connected and this property remains for arbitrary choice of @xmath97 @xmath147 or @xmath17 , as one would expect .",
    "in addition @xmath148 @xmath149 while @xmath150 @xmath151 the maximal rank of persistent homology of this random network is @xmath43 .",
    "however , due to the short lifetime of @xmath152 through only two filtrations , it may be inferred that the content of topological noise dominates the network for this choice of parameters @xmath97 and @xmath17 .",
    "the same results , from the aspect of persistence , are obtained for the neighborhood complex @xmath153 @xmath154 @xmath155 @xmath156 increasing the probability @xmath97 or the number of nodes @xmath17 leads to occurrence of higher dimensional homology groups which though appear only as noise as illustrated in fig . 8 for the case of @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "there is an interval outside which homology vanishes , and inside which only lowest ranked homologies persist , i.e. @xmath78 and @xmath152 .",
    "this conlcusion is in agreement with recent theoretical studies on clique and neighborhood complexes of random graphs @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in order to analyze the emergence of self - similar properties in a complex network , an e - mail network was studied in @xcite .",
    "each e - mail address in this network represents a node and links between nodes indicate e - mail communication between them . after removal of bulk e - mails ,",
    "the connectivity distribution of this network is exponential , @xmath159 for @xmath160 and with @xmath161 the number of nodes ( e - mail users ) is 1700 .",
    "calculations were performed using both the clique and the neighborhood complex and both showed consistent persistency property . the corresponding persistency barcode is presented in fig . 9",
    "in which the rank of the homology group equals the number of intervals in the barcode intersecting the dashed line which corresponds to the filtration stage .",
    "the first three homology groups , i.e. @xmath78 , @xmath152 and @xmath162 have long lived generators while higher dimensional homology groups appear only as topological noise .",
    "although random networks analyzed earlier and the e - mail network have comparable number of nodes , the number of higher dimensional homology groups is considerably larger in the latter case .",
    "this is the consequence of  an internal organization of an e - mail network into a number of communities arenas which is an essential prerequisite for emergence of higher dimensional complete graphs .",
    "clearly , no such organizational principle exists in random networks ( random simplicial complexes ) and @xmath43-cycles dominate the complex .",
    "the fact that homology groups of dimension higher than @xmath42 have short lifetimes indicates that communications among certain groups of e - mail users may not exist for a certain time during the growth of the network however these communication channels are reestablished at later stages of the network evolution .",
    "among scale - free networks we consider scale - free models with modular structure developed recently @xcite . the model including preferential - attachement and preferential - rewiring during the graph growth",
    "is generalized so that new modules are allowed to start growing with finite probability . the structural properties of modular networks",
    "are controlled by three parameters : the average connectivity @xmath163 , the probability of the emergence of a new modul @xmath164 and the attractiveness of the node @xmath165 by varying these parameters the internal structure of modules and the network connecting various modules is kept under control .",
    "detailed explanation of the role of each of these parameters in the control process are discussed in @xcite .",
    "here we consider the persistent homology of three scale - free networks developed using three diferent sets of parameters @xmath166 @xmath167 @xmath168 chosen as paradigmatic for the type of network considered .",
    "the results for both clique and neighborhood complexes were constructed and since the results do not differ for the two cases the presented ones are obtained from the clique complex filtration [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] .",
    "all networks were generated with 1000 nodes .",
    "the average connectivity ( number of links per node ) is @xmath169 .",
    "the network has @xmath170 nodes and @xmath171 modules so that @xmath172 the attractiveness of the node is @xmath173 which enables stronger clustering effect , hence the label `` clustered modular network '' .",
    "the corresponding barcodes are presented in fig . 10 .",
    "there are unique persistent generators for @xmath78 and @xmath152 while for @xmath174 there are @xmath42 persistent generators .",
    "@xmath175 also has a persistent generator which starts at stage @xmath42 of filtration .",
    "it is interesting that once the homology is generated at later stages of filtration it remains persistent for all @xmath176 @xmath177 as indicated by arrows .",
    "one aspect of existence of persistent homology groups is robustness of the complex ( network ) with respect to addition or reduction of simplices ( nodes ) .",
    "the fact that four homology groups show persistence is a clear sign of robustness .",
    "moreover , practically there is no topological noise in this case .",
    "the parameters for this type of network are @xmath178 @xmath179 ( no modules ) and @xmath173 ( strong clustering ) .",
    "the persistence barcodes for this network are presented in fig .",
    "the most striking feature of these topological persistency representations is the existence of @xmath180 another striking feature is that @xmath175 does not exist for this particular value of clustering parameter @xmath181 showing that higher ranked persistency generators may not be distributed continuously across dimensions .",
    "there are four generators for @xmath182 however they persist through five stages of filtration and there are several more generators with shorter lifetime some of which may be considered as topological noise , such as the ones whose lifetime is one or two filtration phases . the fact that @xmath175 generators do not exist shows that for this choice of parameters there are no @xmath41-dimensional non - bounding cycles in the complex .",
    "the average connectivity is @xmath169 .",
    "modular probability is @xmath183 and clustering coefficient @xmath184 so that there is only one link between each of the modules and effectively there is non clustering .",
    "the corresponding barcodes are shown in fig .",
    "there is only one generator for @xmath185 for @xmath152 there is a unique generator persistent from the beginning of filtration however there are several generators which persist while occurring with the slight delay in filtration sequence .",
    "the maximal persistent homology rank is @xmath42 and @xmath174 has relatively long lived generators with a slight noise .",
    "of the three cases considered this one has the smallest number of persistent homology groups , namely three ( @xmath78 , @xmath186 and @xmath174 ) , and also the smallest number of generators for the homology group @xmath174 .",
    "since both clustered modular and clustered non - modular networks have higher ranked persistent homology ( @xmath175 and @xmath182 respectively ) then the non - clustered modular network ( @xmath174 ) , it is clear that clustered networks are more robust with respect to addition ( removal ) of nodes ( simplices ) .",
    "moreover , clustering property is more important for robustness then modularity as may be also inferred by comparison with the e - mail network discussed in sec .",
    "7 which also shows modular structure .",
    "the fact that only @xmath187-dimensional and @xmath42-dimensional cycles ( voids ) are persistently missing in non - clustered simplices with respect to additional lack of @xmath41 and @xmath40-dimensional cycles in modular simplices may convey important information depending upon the context of the analysis and types of networks under study .",
    "in general the persistence of @xmath17-th homology generators ( @xmath17-th betti numbers ) means that somewhere in the complex @xmath17-th dimensional subcomplex is missing through all stages of complex growth or reduction . in other words",
    "an @xmath17-dimensional object formed by simplices of dimension at most @xmath17 is absent from the complex .",
    "this property may be translated to the `` network language '' in terms of connectivity relations which depend on the context . in simplified terms ,",
    "for example for @xmath188 the network lacks in dyadic ( binary ) relations ; for @xmath188 there are no triadic ( ternary ) relations and so on where @xmath17-adic relations should be regarded not only as the set of its node - to - node relations but in their relational entirety . as an example",

    "construction of simplicial complexes from graphs ( networks ) creates a topological setting which offers flexible tools for gauging various topological attributes . here",
    "our interest lies in detection of long lived homology groups of a simplicial complex ( network ) during the course of its history which includes both addition and removal of simplices ( nodes ) .",
    "the method relies on visual approach of recognizing persistent features in the form of a barcode which may be regarded as the persistence analogue of a betti number .",
    "the results show distinct persistency attributes for random networks , networks with exponential degree distributions and for scale - free networks .",

    "an obvious consequence of persistency is that it gives important information about robust quality of the network so that scale - free networks , especially the ones with clustering properties , exhibit the highest topological resilience to change in the form of addition or removal of the nodes",
    ". however persistence of certain topological attributes assumes also long lived defficiency in certain topological forms in simplicial complexes corresponding to defficiency of certain relations in networks . in order to reveal more about the sense of balance between these two properties we will use more subtle topological methods in our future work .",
