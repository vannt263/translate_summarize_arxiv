    "the problem of studying the nonlinear processes occuring in open dissipative systems which possess a complex phase - space structure is challenging for a number of branches of modern physics @xcite .",
    "in particular , the laser - based and other nonlinear optical systems are studied intensively in this field of science nowadays @xcite , and a number of important fundamental and applied results has already been obtained .",
    "the ideas of quantum electronics have also deeply penetrated into adjacent branches of modern physics , especially into quantum acoustics @xcite .",
    "a series of new nonlinear phenomena , which arise under the quantum amplification or generation of tera- , hyper- or ultrasonic oscillations in nonequilibrium ( inverted ) acoustic and nanomechanical dissipative systems of various origins , have been predicted theoretically and discovered experimentally during last years @xcite .",
    "the researches concerning the conditions , under which the formation of inverted states and the purposeful control over nonlinear processes in such systems ( the acoustic analogs of lasers ) become possible , are of significant independent interest .    as has already been emphasized in works @xcite , if one confines the consideration to the quantum amplification and generation of _ hypersound _",
    ", i.e. the acoustic waves within the microwave range of frequencies , the following circumstances invoke the greatest interest . a microwave phonon laser ( phaser )",
    "emits acoustic radiation with a wavelength of 13  @xmath5 m , which corresponds to the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation in the near - infrared range , where many ordinary lasers generate as well . at the same time , the velocity of hypersound in the phaser active paramagnetic media is 5 orders of magnitude lower than the velocity of electromagnetic waves .",
    "accordingly , the frequency of stimulated emission ( se ) of acoustic waves in a paramagnetic phaser amounts to @xmath6  3  10  ghz only , which is about the same 5 orders of magnitude lower than the frequency of the electromagnetic se in optical lasers .",
    "therefore , the relative intensity of the spontaneous component @xmath7 of emission in a microwave phaser is about 15 orders of magnitude lower than that in an ordinary optical ( electromagnetic ) laser ( because @xmath8 ) , whereas the lengths of corresponding acoustic and electromagnetic waves coincide .",
    "the low level of the quantum noise in phasers opens new opportunities for studying the nonlinear phenomena in nonequilibrium systems .",
    "this conclusion has already been confirmed experimentally for a paramagnetic phaser with a pink ruby crystal ( @xmath9 ) . in works",
    "@xcite , a new nonlinear resonance ( @xmath10-resonance ) , which is accompanied by a number of interesting dynamical phenomena , has been revealed experimentally in a non - autonomous ruby phaser and studied in details at liquid- helium temperatures and electromagnetic pumping with carrier frequency about 23  ghz .",
    "this @xmath10-resonance arises at modulation of pumping ( or zeeman magnetic field ) in the range of ultralow frequencies @xmath11 , where @xmath12  hz @xcite .",
    "it is considerably lower than the typical frequencies @xmath13 of the usual relaxational resonance ( @xmath14-resonance ) in the ruby phaser ( @xmath15 70300  hz ) , which was observed earlier in works @xcite ( note that @xmath14-resonance in the ruby phaser is an acoustic analog of the well - known laser relaxational resonance ) .    in works",
    "@xcite , it has been discovered experimentally that a plenty of coexisting states of the spin - phonon system emerges in the domain of the @xmath10-resonance and the very slow regular transitions , which remind autowave motions , occur between them .",
    "the period of the full cycle of such transitions reaches giant values and exceeds @xmath16",
    "s at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this is several orders of magnitude longer than the period @xmath18 of an external force that modulates phaser pumping ( or zeeman magnetic field ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that a kind of slowing - down of transient processes in paramagnetic crystals , which accompanies the saturation of spin transitions , has already been studied earlier @xcite under conditions of the so - called phonon bottleneck caused by non - coherent ( thermal ) effects in a resonant spin - phonon system which interacts with a thermostat . however , in the 1970 - 1980s , it has been proved experimentally @xcite that , at least in the microwave range , both the quantum amplification and self - excitation of phonons in phasers arise just in the absence of the phonon bottleneck effect , which could only inhibit the normal functioning of a phaser as a quantum oscillator .    anyway , the phonon bottleneck effect in pink ruby in the microwave range and at temperatures of liquid helium is absent both in our system and in analogous paramagnetic systems used by other authors in numerous investigations of quantum paramagnetic amplifiers . in particular , our experimental data for pink ruby crystals @xcite have demonstrated that at temperatures @xmath19  k the maximal lifetime of resonant phonons with a frequency of about 10  ghz is about @xmath20 times shorter than the time of longitudinal spin relaxation @xmath21  s of chromium ions .",
    "this is the direct manifestation of nonoccurence of phonon bottleneck in the active medium of our phaser .",
    "thus , the emergence of slow processes , which were observed in paramagnetic non - autonomous phaser @xcite , can not evidently be a result of influence of incoherent phonon bottleneck .",
    "the slowing - down of the energy exchange in the active medium of non - autonomous paramagneic phaser , as was shown in @xcite , reflects the peculiarities of the self - organization of dissipative structures in the spin - phonon system of such a phaser , provided a strong external perturbation ov the inversion states of paramagnetic centers .",
    "does such or similar slowing - down exists in an _ autonomous _ phaser , where the self - organization emerges in absence of external forces at all ?",
    "the main goal of this work was experimental search for the answer to this question .",
    "the results of theoretical researches and computer studies @xcite , which have been published recently , served as an additional motivation for this work to be fulfilled .",
    "the experimental part of the work was carried out making use of a microwave phaser @xcite . as it was already pointed out in works @xcite ,",
    "a microwave phaser is an acoustic analog of the class-@xmath3 optical lasers @xcite .",
    "in particular , both in class-@xmath3 lasers and in a phaser the slow processes of the population inversion of active centers ( acs ) are the leading ones , while the fast - relaxing system of the field excitations follows the ac - system evolution .",
    "a phaser differs from a class-@xmath3 laser only by the nature of the stimulated emission ( se ) .",
    "namely , in a class-@xmath3 laser the se is purely electromagnetic , but in a phaser it is mainly acoustic .",
    "the pointed difference is very essential , because velocity of acoustic waves is typically 5 orders lower than velocity of light .",
    "we will discuss this principal difference later .",
    "the main element of the phaser , which was already described in @xcite , is a ruby acoustic fabry ",
    "perot resonator ( afpr ) with two flat and parallel acoustic mirrors .",
    "the ac - system of ruby phaser consists of trivalent cromium ( @xmath22 ) paramagnetic ions in non - magnetic corundum crystal matrix .",
    "the inversion of spin - levels populations of ac - system in ruby phaser is formed by continuous stationary pumping .",
    "the pumping field is a microwave electromagnetic field excited from outside in an electromagnetic pump cavity ( epc ) with the afpr inside .    at one of the acoustic mirrors ,",
    "the thin - film piezoelectric transducer ( composed of a textured @xmath23 film and an @xmath24 interlayer ) is mounted .",
    "this transducer admits to detect an acoustic se ( laser - like phonon emission ) that arises in the arfp when the corresponding ( @xmath22 ) spin transitions are being pumped . in the simplest case the acoustic microwave power spectrum of this se consists of very narrow lines located at eigenfrequencies of arfp @xmath25  9  ghz ( @xmath26  khz ) .",
    "it is important that the thin - film piezoelectric transducer is bi - directional .",
    "so , making use of a microwave external generator ( that excites microwave acoustic vibrations of the @xmath23 film ) , one can inject a phonon flux in the phaser active system inependently from the laser - like phonon emission generated by acs .",
    "the frequency of this injected acoustic signal @xmath27 is equal to the frequency of the microwave external generator and generally is not equal to any of eigenfrequencies of afpr .",
    "other details concerning the thin - film piezoelectric transducer , the afpr , the epc , and the control parameters ( the static magnetic field @xmath28 , the pump frequency @xmath29 , the pump power @xmath30 , etc . ) , can be found in works @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to works @xcite , all the measurements of microwave phonon se were carried out provided that any modulation of the control parameters was absent .",
    "therefore , all the se regimes observed in this work concern exclusively the autonomous phaser .",
    "provided that the pumping is absent ( the pump power @xmath31 ) , and the amplitude and direction of @xmath28 are far from the lines of the acoustic paramagnetic resonance ( apr ) of the system @xmath32 , the absorption of injected hypersound with the frequency @xmath27 , is governed by the two following mechanisms :    ( m1 ) non - resonant attenuation of hypersound in the @xmath32 crystal .",
    "this attenuation is characterized by the `` volume '' decrement @xmath33 of hypersound in the crystal medium itself . the value @xmath33 depends , first of all , on the crystal matrix perfection .",
    "in addition , this value includes also hypersound energy leakage through the lateral ( non - mirror ) surface of the afpr ;    ( m2 ) hypersound losses at the acoustic mirrors ( one of which is additively loaded by the thin - film piezoelectric transducer ) .",
    "this attenuation is characterized by the effective `` mirror '' decrement @xmath34 of hypersound .",
    "the value @xmath34 takes into account leakage of the hypersound energy through imperfect mirror surfaces of the afpr .",
    "so it depends strongly on the mirrors quality and the transducer s loading .    both mechanisms ( m1 ) and ( m2 ) lead to decreasing of intensity of the injected hypersound in afpr , because @xmath33 and @xmath34 are always positive .",
    "if the injected hypersound frequency @xmath27 is scanned , the acoustic microwave resonances are observed in the afpr at @xmath35 .",
    "these acoustic resonances are similar to ordinary electromagnetic ones in an optical fabry - perot resonator .",
    "it is obvious that the pointed acoustic resonances one can observe even in pure corundum ( @xmath36 ) afpr .    at @xmath31 and @xmath37",
    ", the value and direction of @xmath28 can be tuned in such a manner that the apr arises in the @xmath38 paramagnetic system @xcite .",
    "the apr is realized when the splitting for a sertain pair of energy levels @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the @xmath32 system approximately coincides with @xmath41 and the quantum transition @xmath42 is allowed for interaction with hypersound @xcite .",
    "additively , the intensity of injected hypersound @xmath43 must not be excessively high , namely @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is saturation intensity for the quantum transition @xmath46 in @xmath32 paramagnetic system .",
    "under these conditions , the additional losses of hypersound take place at @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the vertex of the magnetic - field - line of the apr at the frequency @xmath27 .",
    "so , we have the third mechanism of the absorption of injected hypersound in our system , namely :    ( m3 ) resonant paramagnetic attenuation of hypersound , which depends strongly on @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath43 , as well as on the hypersound type ( longitudinal , fast transverse , slow transverse ) @xcite",
    ".    one can not observe this resonant paramagnetic attenuation in pure corundum ( @xmath36 ) or in any other non - magnetic medium .",
    "the ( m3 ) kind of hypersound attenuation is caused by spin - phonon interaction in paramagnetic medium ( the ruby crystal @xmath38 in our case ) .",
    "phenomenologically this attenuation is characterized by the effective `` magnetic '' decrement @xmath49 of hypersound .",
    "the superscript @xmath50 indicates that pumping is absent ( @xmath51 ) . quantitative description of the apr phenomenon and rigorous formulae for hypersound attenuation one can find in @xcite    it is obvious , that @xmath52 ( as far as @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) , and no amplification of injected hypersound in afpr takes place in absence of pumping .",
    "let the electromagnetic pumping is switched on ( @xmath53 ) at a frequency @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is an eigenfrequency of the epc .",
    "the vertex @xmath56 of the magnetic - field - line of the electron spin resonance ( esr ) at the frequency @xmath29 generally does not coincide with that of the apr line @xmath48 at the frequency @xmath27 .",
    "but if the condition @xmath57 is satisfied ( e.  g. after an appropriate tuning of the frequency @xmath27 ) , and the esr line is saturated , the apr line becomes inverted @xcite .",
    "in other words , the paramagnetic absorption of injected hypersound is changed by its phaser amplification . as for the specific conditions for the inversion of the apr line at the esr saturation ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "if all the non - magnetic losses of hypersound ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) in the afpr are totally compensated owing to the phaser amplification , the self - excitation of hypersound arises .",
    "this self - excitation is possible even in absence of an injected signal : exponential growth of small noisy ( thermal ) acoustic seed is the cause of the acoustic instability leading to the hypersound self - excitation @xcite .",
    "conditions of self - excitation of acoustic waves in a phaser are much more comlicated than conditions of self - excitation of electromagnetic waves in lasers .",
    "two main causes of the pointed complexity are as follows : ( i ) the coexistence of longitudinal , transverse and mixed types of acoustic waves at an arbitrary direction of hypersound propagation and ( ii ) very high anisotropy of spin - phonon interaction in active paramagnetic crystals .    in this work ,",
    "the geometrical axis of the afpr @xmath58 coincides with the ruby s crystallographic axis of the third order @xmath59 . in this case",
    "no mixed types of acoustic waves exist along the afpr axis .",
    "moreover , it is known that , in the case of transverse acoustic waves with the wave vector @xmath60 , the so - called conical refraction takes place @xcite .",
    "the last phenomenon is a consequence of degeneration of fast and slow transverse acoustic modes propagating along @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "hence , only pure longitudinal hypersound modes with the wave vector @xmath61 posses a high q - factor in such an afpr at its microwave eigenfrequencies @xmath62 .    when the pump power in our system is slowly increased beginning from @xmath63 , the considered compensation of non - magnetic losses of hypersound achieves ( step by step ) for different logitudinal afpr modes @xmath62 .",
    "first of all , self - excitation of hypersound arises at the logitudinal afpr mode @xmath64 which is located most closely to the center of the inverted apr line @xmath65 . for this mode",
    ", the condition @xmath66 holds true ahead of all other modes @xmath62 , as @xmath30 increases .",
    "here , @xmath67 is the effective acoustic q - factor of the phaser system for the mode @xmath68 under pumping .",
    "this effective acoustic q - factor is determined by the relation : @xmath69 where @xmath70 ; @xmath71 ; @xmath72 the q - factor of the afpr at the @xmath68 mode in the absence of pumping , and @xmath73 is the magnetic q - factor of this mode under pumping .",
    "in contrast to @xmath74 , the magnetic @xmath73 can be negative .",
    "it looks like @xmath75^{-1 } ,    \\label{eq:03}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the increment of quantum amplification of hypersound for the mode under consideration ; @xmath77 is the inversion ratio for the apr line ( in the case of inversion , @xmath78 ) ; @xmath79 is the effective `` magnetic '' decrement of hypersound with frequency @xmath80 in the absense of pumping .",
    "following works @xcite , we write down the expression for @xmath81 at the spin transition @xmath46 , in the form : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the concentration of paramagnetic centers ; @xmath84 ; @xmath85 is the form - factor of the apr line ; @xmath86 is the crystal density ; @xmath87 is the boltzmann constant ; @xmath88 is the coupling parameter of the spin transition @xmath46 with hypersound .",
    "the matrix element @xmath88 for a longitudinal hypersound wave propagating along the ruby s axis of the third order @xmath89 is determined as follows(the coordinate axis @xmath90 is parallel to @xmath89 ) : @xmath91 here , @xmath92 is the component of the elastic strain tensor ; @xmath93 is the hamiltonian of spin - phonon interaction @xcite ; @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the wave functions of paramagnetic ion in the crystalline field ( these wave functions belong to the ion s energy levels @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) respectively ; @xmath98 is the component of the spin - phonon interaction tensor @xcite ; and @xmath99 is the projection of the vectorial spin operator onto the @xmath90-axis .    in order to estimate @xmath88 ,",
    "let us use the experimentally found value @xmath100  @xmath101 = @xmath102  erg @xcite , as well as the wave functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 which belong to the energy levels @xmath105 and @xmath106 of the @xmath22 ion in the trigonal crystalline field of ruby ( in this work , similarly to works @xcite , @xmath107 ) .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ eq:05 ] ) , for the magnetic field @xmath108  koe directed at an angle @xmath109 with respect to the @xmath90-axis , where @xmath110 , we find @xmath111  erg .",
    "the choice of @xmath112 was dictated by the requirements of the so - called symmetric ( or push - pull ) pumping regime which was also used by us earlier to enhance the inversion ratio in a phaser @xcite . as the result , at @xmath113  ghz , @xmath114  s , @xmath115  @xmath116 , @xmath117  g/@xmath118 , @xmath119  cm / s , @xmath120 , we find from eq .",
    "( [ eq:04 ] ) that @xmath121  @xmath101 .",
    "the acoustic q - factor @xmath74 for our ruby afpr ( loaded by the piezoelectric film ) was measured making use of the pulse - echo method at the frequency @xmath122  ghz .",
    "the value of @xmath74 was found to be @xmath123 at @xmath124 and @xmath31 .",
    "whence , @xmath125 + @xmath126 .    for the case of an autonomous phaser",
    ", a simple relation takes place between @xmath127 , @xmath128 and the threshold value @xmath129 , at which the generation of the first mode begins .",
    "this relation reads as follows : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the critical value of the inversion ratio @xmath77 at the transition @xmath132 . substituting @xmath133  @xmath101 and @xmath134  @xmath101 into eq .",
    "( [ eq:06 ] ) , we find that @xmath135 , which can be ensured liberally by the push - pull pumping scheme .",
    "the autogeneration of longitudinal hypersound in the autonomous ruby phaser was detected provided that external perturbations were absent both in the signal and pump channels .",
    "the microwave electromagnetic signal , excited in the hypersound transducer by the microwave phonon se , was supplied to a heterodyne spectrum analyzer , and the spectra obtained were registered from its screen by a photocamera .",
    "all these experiments were fulfilled at temperatures below the superfluid critical point of liquid helium @xmath136  k , which allowed us to avoid the difficulties related to the boiling of this cryogenic liquid .",
    "now , let us consider the obserwed microwave power spectra of the phonon se in the autonomous phaser generator in detail .",
    "since the frequency width @xmath137 of the apr line for the spin transition @xmath138 amounts to approximately @xmath139  mhz , and the distance between the afpr modes is only about @xmath140  khz , the primary single - mode se easily transfroms to a multi - mode one , even if the excess over the pumping threshold is comparatively small .",
    "in other words , there emerges a coarse structure ( cs ) of the phonon generation ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "provided @xmath141  ghz , and @xmath142  koe , the multimode phonon generation is observed even at @xmath143 .    under the condition of the magnetic - field detuning @xmath144 , it is natural that a considerably more intense pumping is needed for the condition @xmath145 to be satisfied .",
    "on the other hand , the increasing of a pumping level is also necessary if there is some frequency detuning @xmath146 , where @xmath147 .",
    "if the pumping is swithed on abruptly , the transient process , which takes place in the course of establishment of the stationary integral intensity of se @xmath148 , demonstrates an oscillatory behavior .",
    "the frequency @xmath13 of these damped oscillations ( the so called relaxation frequency ) for our system has , as it was already mentioned , a value of the order @xmath149  hz @xcite .    the lifetime of this transient process @xmath150 is shorter than @xmath151  s at @xmath152  mw and provided that the magnetic - field and pump - frequency detunings are absent ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "therefore , if the phaser system is finely tuned and the pumping is powerful enough , the transient process is rather fast ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "this experimental fact agrees with theoretical estimations @xcite of @xmath150 made in the framework of the elementary ( balance ) model of se @xcite : @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the pumping parameter ( for our system , @xmath157 @xcite ) . in other words , under the conditions specified above , the process of formation of the stationary cs of the phaser power spectra terminates approximately within the same time interval , over which the stationary resonant absorption in a passive ( non - inverted ) paramagnetic system becomes settled .",
    "at @xmath158  mw , @xmath159 , and the small magnetic - field detunings @xmath160  oe , the integral intensity @xmath148 of multimode se of an autonomous phaser , as it was already pointed out in works @xcite , practically does not depend on time .",
    "provided that the pumping is powerful enough and its frequency is tuned finely , the measured magnitude of @xmath148 weakly ( in the limits of several percent ) oscillates only if @xmath161 is increased to about @xmath162  oe and more @xcite .    in the corresponding non - stationary microwave phonon power spectra , some cs modes of autonomous phaser become splitted at @xmath163  oe .",
    "one of the typical cases of such the splitting for a phaser se mode is shown in work @xcite .",
    "thus , the fine structure ( fs ) spontaneously arises in microwave phonon power spectrum .",
    "we stress that no external forcing is needed for emergence of fs , in contrary to other nonlinear phenomena investigated by us at the cs level @xcite .",
    "the intensities of the fs components @xmath164 observed in @xcite , were very low , even at @xmath165 .",
    "this is several orders of magnitude lower than the intensities of the non - splitted se components of stationary generation which are depicted at fig .  1 .",
    "however , if the phaser system becomes appreciably detuned by the pump frequency ( @xmath166  mhz ) , the emergence of the fs in the microwave power spectra of phaser generation is observed even at @xmath167  oe . in this case , @xmath164 are of the same order of magnitude as the unsplitted cs components . in fig .  2 , the splitting of the cs mode into two and three intense fs components is demonstrated , as @xmath168 increases from 0 up to @xmath169  oe .",
    "one can also notice very weak additional fs components against the noise background .",
    "the appearance of the regular fs with a few ( 2 to 3 ) components of the splitted cs mode of phonon se can be explained in the framework of the casperson ",
    "yariv mechanism @xcite .",
    "the normalized dispersion @xmath170 of the phase velocity for hypersound with the frequency @xmath171 in a paramagnetic afpr possessing a certain eigenfrequency of the cs mode @xmath172 looks like @xmath173 where @xmath174 , @xmath175 $ ] , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 .",
    "now , let us introduce the additional detuning of the system by changing the static magnetic field @xmath178 with respect to its resonsnt value @xmath179 .",
    "using the dimensionless magnetic - field detuning @xmath180 , we have the following formula for the dependence of the dispersion of the hypersound phase velocity on the magnetic field : @xmath181 where @xmath182    now , we apply the well - known casperson ",

    "this three - component splitting is typical due to it s non - critical nature .",
    "the two - component splitting is , strictly speaking , critically dependent on variations of @xmath198 , but in real experiment there exist a small but finite range of @xmath198 in the vicinity of bifurcation point making it possible to observe unhesitatingly the two - component fs ( see fig .  2 , middle oscillogram ) .",
    "thereby , the `` static '' casperson - yariv model considered above demonstrates a possible mechanism of spontaneous ( not connected with external factors ) splitting of a cs mode into two or three components , depending on magnetic field detuning . this model gives a satisfactory interpretation of such the splitting fs",
    "moreover , the casperson - yariv model can be improved considerably by making allowance for the effects of hole burning in the amplification line etc . @xcite .",
    "but a series of other results on microwave phonon se in the autonomous phaser needs alternative approaches for at least qualitative explanation of phaser dynamics observed in our experiments . very interesting , in particular , are the issues concerning transient processes of the fs emergence , especially in the case where the characteristic time of a transient process @xmath150 is much longer than the spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath213 ( and a control parameter set is far from the critical one ) .",
    "processes of self - induced non - critical slowing of evolution have been studied intensively in recent years in nonlinear autonomous systems of various nature , and important results have already been obtained by means of computer modeling @xcite .",
    "in this work , we focus our attention first on two specific issues , namely , whether such slow processes may proceed in an autonomous phaser and which is the nature of coexistence of incongruous states arising during the pointed transient processes in the phaser active medium .",
    "the relation between obtained experimental results and those of computer modeling @xcite will be discussed in details after exposition of experimental data .",
    "our observations of the spectra of phonon se in the autonomous phaser showed that , provided @xmath214 and @xmath146 , the characteristic time of transient processes , which accompany the emergence of the spectral fs , considerably exceeds the time of longitudinal relaxation of @xmath215 ions in ruby at the same temperature @xmath216 : @xmath217 .",
    "for example , for the fs depicted in fig .  2 , @xmath218  s ( here , @xmath219  k ) .",
    "not only is this by two orders of magnitude longer than @xmath220 , but also is much longer than the time of establishing of the stationary cs at @xmath221 and @xmath159 .",
    "moreover , after the process having terminated , the structure of the power spectra is , as a rule , nonstationary . instead",
    ", there appear periodic oscillations of the intensities of the fs components or even the periodic motions of these components along the frequency axis whithin the limits of several khz .",
    "these oscillations and motions , as well as the preceding transient process , run slowly in comparison to the relaxation time of active @xmath222 centers .    at first glance ,",
    "the anomalously great values of @xmath150 which were observed in the generating phaser system under conditions of detunings @xmath223 can be explained as the result of influence of the slowly relaxing subsystem of magnetic nuclei @xmath224 of aluminium ions @xmath225 which belong to the corundum crystalline matrix .",
    "such an influence of @xmath224 nuclei on electron paramagnetic system of active @xmath222 centers has been revealed experimentally earlier @xcite at qualitatively different conditions , namely in experiments on phaser _ amplification _ of hypersound in ruby .",
    "studying of phaser amplification in @xcite were fulfilled , naturally , below the self - excitation threshold of phaser generation , i.  e. at inversion ratios @xmath226 . in this case , the dominant role of electron - nuclear interactions in slowing - down of transient processes of non - generating phaser was established in @xcite and confirmed in alternative experiments on phaser amplification at the mentioned condition @xmath226 ( under condition of self - focusing of hypersound ) @xcite .",
    "however , our further researches have demonstrated that under the phaser _ generation _ , when @xmath145 , this electron - nuclear mechanism of transient processes slowing - down does not dominate .",
    "really , the slow motions , which were observed in the electron - nuclear magnetic system of ruby phaser amplifier @xcite , are characterized by the well - known restriction on the maximal time of the transient process @xmath150 in this system  the relaxation time @xmath227 of the zeeman reservoir for the subsystem of magnetic nuclei @xcite . under our experimental conditions",
    ", @xmath227 does not exceed 10  s , which is three times shorter than the values of @xmath150 observed at the fs emergence in the power spectra of the phaser generation .",
    "more detailed researches of the power spectra of an autonomous phaser demonstrated that , under definite conditions , the fs formation can occur following much more comlcated scenarios than those in the experiments described above . in this case , the ultimate state of the se line turns out qualitatively different from what is shown in fig .  2 , and the time of the corresponding transient process grows substantially ( @xmath228  s ) .",
    "such the situation takes place , e.  g. , if , provided @xmath229 , the parameter @xmath168 is increased several times with respect to those @xmath168 values , for whch the fs shown in fig .  2 was observed .",
    "let us consider these experimens in detail .",
    "provided the same values of pump power and pump frequency detuning as in the previous experiments ( i.  e. @xmath230  mw , @xmath231  8,8  mhz ) , but for the enlarged magnetic - field detuning up to @xmath232  15  oe , the regular fs ( which is shown in fig .",
    "2 ) was found to be gradually destroyed . in approximately 10  min after the indicated detuning having been introduced , the form of some fs lines became apparently chaotic . in this work ,",
    "we use the term `` chaotic fs '' , not specifying the kind of the disorder observed , because it is not still clear , whether this is a multi - dimensional deterministic chaos or some form of a small - scale spin - phonon turbulence .",
    "the experimental data presented below allow us to assert only that the dimension of the phase space , which is necessary to describe the observed chaotic fs , should be much higher than that in the case of the ordinarylow - dimension deterministic chaos which was studied in phasers whith periodic pump modulation @xcite .    a typical view of the chaotic fs in an autonomous phaser is shown in fig .",
    "3 . unlike the regular fs which can be either static or periodically pulsing ,",
    "the chaotic fs is distinguished for fast , irregular , and mutually non - synchronized pulsations of the amplitudes of its numerous components .",
    "moreover , these chaotic pulsations of amplitudes are accompanied by similar irregular and mutually non - synchronized motions of the fs components along the frequency axis ( back and forth in narrow frequency windows ) .    from fig .  3",
    ", one can see that the spectral width of such a chaotic fs line of the phonon se is several times greater than the width of the line with a regular fs . at the same temperature @xmath233  k , holding both @xmath234 and @xmath168 constant ( namely",
    ", @xmath235  8.8  mhz , @xmath232  15  oe ) , but reducing the pump power @xmath30 by a factor of four , a diminishing of the peak intensity of the chaotic fs components was observed , as well as some narrowing of the fs line as a whole ( fig .",
    "the further reduction of @xmath30 results in disruption of the phonon generation at the chaotic se mode . just before this mode extinguishing ( at @xmath236  mw ) , its structure becomes somewhat ordered as compared with cases shown at fig .  3 and fig .  4 .",
    "the disruption of the phonon generation at a chaotic se mode may happen , as it was observed in our experiments , at fixed @xmath30 as well , but when varying @xmath234 or @xmath168 .",
    "in so doing , contrary to the case of reducing @xmath30 , the chaotization of the nearest neighboring unsplitted cs mode was often observed .",
    "it is essential that the described phenomena of chaotization of fs lines are very selective with regard to detunings of the phaser on the pump frequency and the static magnetic field .",
    "chaotization take place only in the rather narrow windows of @xmath234 and @xmath168 . outside of these windows , the strongly marked chaotization of the se lines",
    "was not achieved , but some intermediate states of the fs were observed outside such windows as well .",
    "for example , a fs line may contain only two or three robust components , which pulse smoothly and move asynchronously along the frequency axis ( within an interval of about 20  khz ) .",
    "a kind of such an intermediate fs state ( emerged in the same ruby phaser , but at @xmath237  30",
    "oe ) was already exemplified by us in @xcite .",
    "the described above internally caused chaotic pulsations of the fs components in our autonomous phaser are fast for most fixed sets of the control parameters used in our experiments .",
    "typical times of the fs intramode motions are less than 1  s. on the other hand , the externally excited _ transitions _ from one chaotic state to another ( initiated by a step - type changing of at least one of the control parameters ) proceed even more slowly than in the case of transitions between various states of a regular fs . typical values of @xmath150 for transitions between states of a chaotic fs ( e.g. , between states shown at fig .  3 and fig .",
    "4 ) amount to @xmath238  s. no external forcing of the system takes place here , so we obviously deal with self - organized bottleneck in transients between selective chaotic states in phaser medium .",
    "giant times of transient processes are comparable with the characteristic times of superslow motions observed earlier in the non - autonomous ( periodically - modulated ) ruby phaser @xcite .",
    "however , the similarity between superslow processes in non - autonomous ( studied in @xcite ) and autonomous ( studied in the present paper ) phasers at this point comes to end . for the _ non - autonomous _",
    "phaser @xcite , the emergence of superslow motions is a characteristic feature of the whole power spectrum ( the typical width of the phonon se power spectrum amounts to several mhz ) . in this case , the `` firing '' of microwave phonon cs modes on one side of the spectrum is accompanied by the `` extinguishing '' of approximately the same number of cs modes on its opposite side .",
    "this phenomenon of alternation of microwave phonon ce modes was observed in @xcite under deep modulation of phaser pump at frequencies of nonlinear resonance ( about @xmath239  hz in the investigated system ) and its even harmonics .    of the _",
    "autonomous _ phaser , typical are the scenarios , when the majority of microwave phonon cs modes are almost stationary , and their frequencies are very close to frequencies of normal modes of the afpr .",
    "only the small quantity of the cs modes ( usually no more than two ) , as it was described above , are splitted , shifted in frequency and even chaotized at certain combinations of the control parameters .",
    "the definite modification of such a combination of the control parameters is needed in order to translocate this selective phonon mode `` fever '' to the nearest neighboring cs modes .",
    "but times of the mode structure reconfiguration are much more greater than times of the individual ac s relaxaton time . generally speaking , there are two unusual and interrelated phenomena observed in our autonomous system : coexistence of incongruous states ( neighboring of dominant normal and selectively chaotized cs modes ) and the self - organized bottleneck in transients between these states in phaser medium .",
    "a theoretical model of the observed highly nonlinear phenomena requires a separate studies which must include spatio - temporal microscopic description of the local interactions between individual acs .",
    "these interactions were considered by us earlier @xcite only at the level of nonequilibrium thermodynamics , namely , by using spin - temperature approach @xcite , which by definition neglects individuality of the acs .",
    "some preliminary numerical results towards this direction have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "below , the spatial phenomena and the transient processes , which were observed in computer experiments on excitable systems @xcite , as well as their relation to the described above results of real experiments ( including self - organized bottleneck and coexistence of incongruous states in the autonomous phaser ) , will be discussed . but",
    "first , it is necessary to stop at some conceptual moments dealing with phaser models .",
    "slow transient processes at the phaser _ amplification _ of hypersound ( below the threshold of the phaser self - excitation ) were observed in 19701980 @xcite .",
    "the characteristic time of those processes did not exceed , as it was said above , the relaxation time of @xmath224 nuclei which form an additional energy reservoir in the phaser active medium .",
    "this reservoir interacts with the electron spin subsystem of the active cromium centers in the crystalline matrix of @xmath240 owing to a thermal contact between the system of @xmath224 nuclei and the electron dipole - dipole ( @xmath241@xmath241 ) reservoir made up by locally interacting @xmath222 @xcite .",
    "such a contact is possible due to the proximity of the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) frequencies of @xmath224 _ nuclei _ to the characteristic frequencies of _ electronic _",
    "@xmath241@xmath241 interactions in the system of @xmath222 ions in ruby ( all these frequencies are of the order of 10  mhz ) . as a result",
    ", the slow evolution of the joint electron - nuclear system of thew ruby phaser amplifier can be described adequately @xcite in the framework of the nonequilibrium spin thermodynamics concept @xcite .",
    "it is known that those concepts are based on the hypothesis about the so - called spin temperatures @xcite , i.  e. some macroscopic characteristics of the energy reservoirs of a nonequilibrium quantum system , the saturation of which is typically ensured by an external coherent field with a frequency close to one of the system s resonances ( nmr , esr , or apr ) .",
    "we emphasize that it is the fact of saturating the system by an external resonant field that enables us to analyze the distribution of spin level populations in the coordinate system which rotates synchronously with the frequency of the applied field . under rather general conditions , such a distribution of spin - level populations is exponential , which allows us to speak about such a macroscopic parameter as the spin temperature .",
    "a different is the situation , when various modes of phaser _ generation _ emerge , evolve , and reach their dynamically stable states .",
    "really , even provided that the fs is absent , the spin system of a phaser generator becomes saturated not only due to the pump field , but also due to the fields of microwave phonon se at several cs frequencies ( see fig .  1 )",
    ", because the single - mode phaser generation is unstable @xcite . in this case , individual spin temperatures for all the individual spin reservoirs ( which generate the corresponding cs microwave modes ) have to be considered .",
    "the quantity of simultaneously self - saturating microwave cs modes with various eigenfrequencies reaches about 10  20 and more @xcite .",
    "so the thermodynamical approach is here not so clear as in the case of single - frequency saturation studied in @xcite .",
    "again , the occurence of a regular fs ( fig .",
    "2 ) not only increases the number of macroscopic parameters , which are necessary for description of the active system behavior , but also calls into question the adequacy of such a thermodynamical approach in general . concerning the _ chaotic _ fs of a phaser generator ( fig .",
    "3 ) , the macroscopic thermodynamical model of saturated spin system @xcite , which yelded the satisfactory results for a phaser amplifier @xcite , becomes obviously unacceptable now .    in order to understand the mechanisms of formation of the chaotic fs ( including such issues as the slowing - down of transient processes , the coexistence of regular and chaotic cs modes , and so on ) we have to deal with the simulation of inversion states dynamics at the _ microscopic _ level .",
    "carrying out the direct simulation of the evolution of an active multiparticle system on the basis of the maxwell  bloch coupled equation @xcite becomes inexpedient even at the number of acs @xmath242 , because too huge computational resources would be required for this purpose .",
    "alternative is the way to apply discrete models of cellular automata ( ca ) type @xcite .",
    "such models use algorithmic schemes with local information processing ( @xmath77- or kolmogorov algorithms @xcite and allow the corresponding ca - programs to run effectively on ordinary personal computers even if @xmath243 .",
    "it is important that @xmath77-algorithms used in most ca - models belong to the @xmath30-time class of complexity @xcite , which allows @xmath244 to be increased by several orders for middle - class computers .      in works",
    "@xcite , a series of computer experiments on a three - level ca ( tlca ) model of a class-@xmath3 phaser - like system was carried out .",
    "the prototype model ( zykov - mikhailov model ) @xcite of excitable system includes mechanisms of global activation ( ga ) , global inhibition ( gi ) and local activation ( la ) of acs .",
    "the la mechanism is a deterministic analog of the one - channel ( 1c ) diffusion of excitations .",
    "the tlca model proposed in @xcite takes into consideration local inhibition ( li ) too . in the framework of the tlca model @xcite ,",
    "the combined la / li interaction between acs is a deterministic analog of the two - channel ( 2c ) diffusion of excitations .",
    "it is well known that in dilute paramagnets the main mechanism of local interactions between acs is namely la  &  li one .",
    "more concrete , this is dipole - dipole magnetic interactions between impurity paramagnetic acs @xcite .",
    "mechanisms of la and li are equal partners in dilute paramagnets , in contrary to negligible role of li in chemical reactions of belousov - zhabotinskii type .",
    "the results of computer experiments showed @xcite , that a typical scenario of the evolution of an autonomous class-@xmath3 system with weak diffusion of excitations is the self - organized formation of vortex - like coherent dissipative structures of the rotating spiral wave ( rsw ) type . in the case of 2c - diffusion ,",
    "transient times for rsw dissipative structures stabilization reach giant values ( of about @xmath245 times more than individual ac s relaxation time ) .",
    "this self - organized coherent bottleneck differs qualitatively from the well - known incoherent phonon bottleneck , which is absent in dilute paramagnets used as phaser active media .",
    "in contrast to the phonon bottleneck or any other incoherent bottleneck , the coherent bottleneck observed in computer experiments @xcite is the result of very slow emergence of dissipative spatio - temporal structures . in some aspects ,",
    "slowing - down phenomena observed in @xcite are similar to self - induced slowing - down of transient processes discovered computationally in both a system of interacting oscillators @xcite and a system of reaction - diffusion type @xcite .",
    "the last system is very similar to the one modeled in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting , that under conditions of strong competition of la and li mechanisms of ac - ac interaction ( 2c - diffusion ) the unexpected phenomenon of rsw `` reflections '' was discovered in three - level ca model of excitable phaser - like system @xcite .",
    "in essence , each `` reflection '' of rsw is , as it was observed in @xcite , the result of nonlinear transformation of the rsw s core in surface layer .",
    "such the phenomenon of rsw _ regeneration _ at the boundaries of an active medium leads to further increasing of transient time in tlca .",
    "a close phenomenon of optical vortex `` self - repairing '' was observed earlier in real physical experiments @xcite .",
    "moreover , computer experiments @xcite demonstrated _ replications _ of rsws in surface layer of three - level active system with 2c - diffusion of excitations . in this case , each collision of rsw with boundary generate several new rsws , which move from boundary into inner area of the system .",
    "self - induced replications of rsws may lead to emergence of transient chaos , when attractor becomes effectively unattainable by any digital computer with limited resources .",
    "hence , plausible looks the assumption that phenomenon of a self - organized bottleneck is the cause of slowing - down of the transient processes in a phaser .",
    "the additional evidence for this assumption is the result of computer experiment @xcite demonstrating coexistence of regular and irregular spatio - temporal structures in tlca ( transient analog of chimera states @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon correlates with the coexistence between the regular and chaotic fs modes of phaser generation described above .",
    "certainly , the possibility for dissipative stuctures of the rsw type to exist in a real phaser system still demands additional researches , also spiral structures have already be observed in dissipative nonlinear optical systems @xcite .",
    "a particular emphasis should be made that , as it was already pointed out in @xcite , the self - organized bottleneck has the origin qualitatively different from that of well - known phenomenon of self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "the soc phenomenon arises only in non - autonomous dissipative systems ( as a nontrivial response to an external destabilizing force ) , whereas the self - organized bottleneck @xcite is a result of internal processes running in the _ autonomous _ dissipative systems .    in this aspect ,",
    "the processes of self0organization observed experimentally in non - autonomous ( our previous works @xcite ) and autonomous ( this work ) phasers may also be examined from qualitatively different points of view . really , slow self - organized motions in the spin - phonon system of a non - autonomous phaser @xcite arize just under the influence of an external resonant destabilizing force and dissappear after swithching the latter off .",
    "a different picture was observed in this work for autonomous phasers , because here the slowing - down of the transient processes is self - induced and does not require any external perturbations .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of a non - autonomous system similar to that described in works @xcite , the slow motions proceed as long as the corresponding destabilizing force is active , while the transient process in an autonomous system has , of course , a finite ( though , may be , very big ) characteristic time . as we have shown in this work ,",
    "the asymptotic state of an autonomous phaser need not necessarily be regular , because the fs may possess a very complicated , turbulent - like structure .",
    "the structure and evolution of power spectra in a ruby - based ( @xmath9 ) autonomous microwave phonon laser ( phaser ) have been studied experimentally at liquid helium temperatures .",
    "the self - organized bottleneck and coexistence of incongruous states ( regular and irregular phonon modes ) were revealed during investigation of fs of microwave phonon power spectra at simultaneous detunings of both the pump frequency and the magnetic field",
    ".    some possible mechanisms of a selective emergence of the irregular fs in the microwave phonon power spectra , the coexistence of regular and irregular phaser spatial subsystems and the nature of superslow transient processes ( self - organized slowing - down ) in an autonomous phaser have been discussed .",
    "the analogous phenomena of self - organized slowing - down have been revealed recently by s.  d.  makovetskiy in computer experiments with a discrete autonomous excitable systems ( daes ) @xcite , which can be regarded as simplified models of phaser media .",
    "one of the typical scenarios of daes evolution is the emergence and very slow ( zeno - like ) development of complicated coherent autostructures ( e.  g. , rotating spiral waves ) which may spatially coexist with irregular ones @xcite .",
    "the numerically revealed phenomenon of the bottlenecked evolution of daes may have the direct relation to the slowing - down of transient processes that were observed experimentally in this work for an autonomous phaser .",
