    "in high energy experiments where the center - of - mass energy , @xmath2 , is much larger than the mass of the quarks , @xmath0 , the latter can often be neglected or an expansion in @xmath3 is sufficient to describe the experimental data . however , there are situations where the full dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath2 is required .",
    "one can , e.g. , think on the high precision which meanwhile has been reached at lep ( cern ) , slc ( slac ) or tevatron ( fermilab ) or on situations where the center - of - mass energy is of the same order of magnitude as the quark masses .",
    "in particular for threshold phenomena the masses are important and the full dependence is desirable .",
    "a variety of important observables can be described by the correlators of two currents with different tensorial structure . if the coupling of the currents to quarks is diagonal quantities like @xmath4 annihilation into hadrons and the decay of the @xmath5 boson are covered by the vector and axial - vector current correlators .",
    "total decay rates of neutral cp even or cp odd higgs bosons can be obtained with the help of the scalar and pseudo - scalar current densities , respectively .",
    "for these cases the full mass dependence at order @xmath6 has been computed in  @xcite for the non - singlet and in  @xcite for the singlet correlators .    in this work we deal with three - loop correlators of currents which couple to two different quarks",
    "flavours : a massless one and one carrying the mass @xmath0 .",
    "the non - diagonal vector and axial - vector correlators describe properties connected to the @xmath7 boson . the absorptive part of these correlators is directly related to the decay width of a ( highly virtual ) @xmath7 boson into quark pairs and gluons",
    ". of particular interest in this connection is the single - top - quark production via the process @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this is because the process directly probes the matrix element @xmath9  one of the few parameters of the standard model not yet experimentally measured .",
    "the imaginary part of the transversal @xmath7 boson polarization function constitutes a gauge invariant and finite contribution of @xmath10 to the process .    as an application of the ( pseudo-)scalar current correlator we consider the decay of a charged higgs boson which occurs in extensions of the standard model .",
    "the corrections provided in this paper describe the total hadronic decay rate of such a boson ( coupled to a massive and a massless quark ) .",
    "in the vector case the polarization function is defined through @xmath11 with @xmath12 . only the transversal part @xmath13 will be considered in the following .",
    "the definition of the scalar polarization function reads @xmath14 with @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath17 quark mass and @xmath0 is its pole mass . throughout this paper",
    "we consider anti - commuting @xmath18 .",
    "this is justified because only non - singlet diagrams contribute ( @xmath19 is supposed to be different from @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus , within perturbation theory , the axial - vector and pseudo - scalar correlators coincide with the vector and scalar ones , respectively .",
    "we consider only the case where one of the quarks is massive .",
    "thus we will identify @xmath19 with @xmath21 , the massless quark , and @xmath20 with @xmath22 which is supposed to be a heavy quark of mass @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variable @xmath23 where @xmath0 refers to the pole mass . for the overall normalization of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 )",
    "we adopt the qed - like conditions @xmath26 .",
    "the physical observables @xmath27 are related to @xmath28 through @xmath29    \\ , ,    \\\\",
    "r^s(s )    & = &   8\\pi \\,\\,\\,\\mbox{im}\\left [ \\pi^s(q^2=s+i\\epsilon ) \\right ]    \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the use of the variables @xmath30 turns out to be useful to describe the high energy and threshold region , respectively .",
    "the expansion of @xmath31 in terms of @xmath32 reads ( @xmath25 ) @xmath33 it is convenient to decompose the three - loop term according to the colour structure @xmath34 where analogous formulae hold for @xmath27 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pidef2 ] ) @xmath35 corresponds to the abelian part already present in qed whereas the non - abelian structure is contained in @xmath36 .",
    "the remaining two structures correspond to the fermionic contributions where @xmath37 counts the number of massless quarks and @xmath38 is the total number of active quark flavours .",
    "a complete analytical computation of @xmath24 at three - loop order or its imaginary part is currently not feasible .",
    "the method we use for the computation of the diagrams is based on conformal mapping and pad approximation  @xcite .",
    "it allows for the computation of a semi - numerical approximation for @xmath24 .",
    "the aim is the reconstruction of the function @xmath24 from the knowledge of some moments for @xmath39 and @xmath40 and additional partial information about the behaviour of @xmath27 close to the threshold , i.e. for @xmath41 .",
    "thus let us in the following briefly discuss the different kinematical regions .",
    "the number of diagrams which contribute at one- , two- and three - loop order is relatively small and amounts to one , three and 31 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless we used geficom  @xcite for the automatic computation .",
    "geficom uses qgraf  @xcite for the generation of the diagrams . in case",
    "an asymptotic expansion has to be applied lmp  @xcite or exp  @xcite are used for the generation of the sub - diagrams .",
    "the occurring vacuum diagrams are passed to matad  @xcite and the massless propagator type diagrams are evaluated with mincer  @xcite .",
    "more details on the automatic computation of feynman diagrams can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we have been able to compute seven terms for small and eight terms for large external momentum @xmath21 both for the vector and scalar correlators of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pivadef ] ) and  ( [ eq : pispdef ] ) , respectively .",
    "this means expansion coefficients up to order @xmath42 , respectively , @xmath43 are available for the pad procedure .",
    "the analytical results are rather bulky and will be published elsewhere .",
    "the born results for the vector and scalar spectral functions are proportional to @xmath44 in the limit @xmath45 as can be seen for the exact results @xmath46 also the corrections of order @xmath32 to @xmath47 and @xmath48 are known  @xcite and a similar threshold behaviour is observed : the spectral functions vanish like @xmath44 ( modulo powers of @xmath49 ) .",
    "this is valid in every order in @xmath32 as follows from heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite .",
    "actually the latter can be used to obtain the leading threshold behaviour of @xmath50 and @xmath51 at @xmath10 from the corresponding correlators in hqet . in particular , the renormalization group equation in the effective theory is used to get the leading logarithmic behaviour at order @xmath6 . afterwards the decoupling relation between the currents in the full and effective theory  @xcite is exploited to get the information about @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for @xmath52",

    "we have computed the non - diagonal correlators of vector and scalar currents at order @xmath6 in the case of the currents composed from a massless and a massive quark field .",
    "our main theoretical tools have been the asymptotic expansions in the large and small momentum region as well as some information about the threshold behaviour provided by hqet .    the obtained results for the case of the ( axial-)vector correlator constitute an important ingredient of the full calculation of next - to - next - to - leading @xmath10 correction to the single - top - quark production via the process @xmath8 .",
