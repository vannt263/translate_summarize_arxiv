    "although significant progress has been made in the last few years in exploring the distribution and chemical composition of intermediate and high - velocity clouds ( ivcs and hvcs , respectively ) in the halo of the milky way , an overall unified model for their formation is still lacking .",
    "these clouds are typically defined as concentrations of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) at velocities inconsistent with a simple model of differential galactic rotation .",
    "the distinction between ivcs and hvcs is loosely based on the observed radial velocities of the clouds ; ivcs have radial velocities with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) of @xmath8 kms@xmath9 kms@xmath3 , while hvcs have velocities @xmath10 kms@xmath3 .",
    "recent studies ( lu et al.1998 ; wakker et al.1999 ; gibson et al.2000 , 2001 ; murphy et al.2000 ; bluhm et al.2001 ; sembach et al . 2001 ) reveal disparate chemical compositions for several of these clouds in different directions in the sky .",
    "the kinematics and chemical make - up of the ivcs and some of the hvcs can be explained successfully by the `` galactic fountain '' model ( shapiro & field 1976 ; houck & bregman 1990 ) , in which hot gas ejected out of the galactic disk by supernova explosions eventually falls back in the form of condensed neutral clouds moving at intermediate and high velocities .",
    "clouds participating in this circulatory pattern should have a nearly solar metallicity reflecting that of their place of origin .",
    "there are , however , a number of hvcs whose abundances are inconsistent with the galactic fountain model .",
    "one such case is the magellanic stream , which has abundances close to those of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and is believed to be tidally stripped out of the smc system during a close encounter with the galaxy ( e.g. , wannier & wrixon 1972 ; lu et al.1998 ; gibson et al.2000 ; sembach et al.2001 ) .",
    "high - velocity cloud complex c has an even lower abundance ( @xmath11 solar ; wakker et al.1999 ) that is inconsistent with gas originating in the disk of the galaxy or in the magellanic clouds .",
    "thus , complex c might represent accreting metal - poor material from intergalactic space .",
    "accretion of substantial quantities of metal - poor gas in the form of hvcs would have a significant influence on the chemical evolution of the milky way .",
    "it is clear that all of the intermediate and high - velocity clouds in the galactic halo do not have a single common origin .",
    "therefore , it is important to quantify the properties of ivcs and hvcs to the greatest extent possible using ultraviolet ( uv ) absorption line spectroscopy .",
    "many astrophysically important atoms and molecules have their electronic transitions in the wavelength region between 912 and 3000  .",
    "ultraviolet absorption line spectroscopy is the most sensitive and accurate method to study gas - phase abundances and physical properties in diffuse interstellar clouds in the galactic halo , where typical gas densities are significantly lower than in galactic disk clouds",
    ". the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) has sufficient sensitivity and spectral resolution to investigate absorption at @xmath12   in the galactic halo and beyond along a large number of sight lines . at longer wavelengths ( @xmath13  ) , the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _",
    "( stis ) on hst provides additional information for a number of atomic species and the ly@xmath14 absorption line of neutral hydrogen near @xmath15  .",
    "combining data from these instruments provides a particulary powerful tool for investigating hvcs and ivcs .    in this study",
    "we use fuse and stis absorption line data to investigate the intermediate- and high - velocity gas in the galactic halo toward the quasar pg1259 + 593 ( @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ; @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "this sight line passes through the intermediate - velocity arch ( iv arch ; kuntz & danly 1996 ) and the high - velocity cloud complex c ( see wakker & vanwoerden 1997 ) .",
    "complex c has been the subject of several recent absorption line studies along different lines of sight .",
    "for example , wakker et al.(1999 ) studied the sulfur abundance of complex c toward mrk290 and found ( s / h ) @xmath18 solar based on uv absorption line data in combination with high resolution hi data from the westerbork radio telescope and h@xmath14 data from the _ wisconsin h@xmath14 mapper _ ( wham ) .",
    "in contrast , murphy et al.(2000 ) observed mrk876 with fuse and found ( / ) @xmath19 times the solar ( fe / h ) ratio in complex c , suggesting little or no depletion of fe into dust grains .",
    "gibson et al.(2001 ) analyzed stis data of the complex c absorption along the sight lines toward mrk 279 , mrk 290 , mrk 501 , mrk 817 , and mrk 876 , and found variations in sii / hi implying ( s / h ) in the range from 0.08 to 0.44 solar .",
    "these variations could be due in part to ionization effects , although intrinsic abundance variations within complex c can not be ruled out .    to avoid having to deal with substantial ionization corrections",
    ", we have chosen to study the metal content in complex c toward pg1259 + 593 .",
    "the sight line passes through complex c in a region of relatively high hi column density ( ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ; wakker et al.2001 ) , so ionization effects are much less important than at lower column densities .",
    "other complex c sight lines either have much lower uv fluxes ( e.g. , mrk 290 ) or substantially lower column densities and greater confusion with lower velocity features ( e.g. , mrk 279 , mrk 876 ) . in the direction of pg1259 + 593 ,",
    "the complex c absorption is well - separated in velocity from the iv arch , thus allowing a direct comparison of intermediate and high - velocity material in the galactic halo _ within the same spectrum_. the iv arch lies at a height of @xmath22 kpc above the galactic plane ( see wakker 2001 ) .",
    "an overall metallicity for the iv arch has yet not been well determined , although several sulfur measurements ( spitzer & fitzpatrick 1993 ; fabian et al . , in preparation ) suggest a near - solar metallicity , in striking contrast to the much lower metallicity of the more distant complex c ( d @xmath23 6.1kpc ; vanwoerden et al.1999 ) .",
    "an extensive summary of absorption line measurements available for many ivcs and hvcs is given by wakker ( 2001 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we review the sight line structure toward pg1259 + 593 in  2 . in ",
    "3 we present the fuse and stis observations of pg1259 + 593 and our analysis methods . in ",
    "4 we discuss absorption from gas associated with complex c ; in  5 we analyze absorption related to the iv arch . in  6",
    "we report the discovery of another ivc component at positive velocities .",
    " 7 provides a brief summary of the velocity distribution of the highly ionized species observed along the sight line .",
    "concluding remarks are given in  8 .",
    "the hi emission lines of the pg1259 + 593 sight line as observed with the effelsberg 100 m telescope ( wakker et al.2001 ; @xmath24 beam ) , the nrao 140 foot telescope at green bank ( murphy et al . , in preparation ; @xmath250 beam ) , and the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( hartmann & burton 1997 ; @xmath26 beam ) are shown in the left panel of figure1 .",
    "three major hi components are visible at @xmath27 and @xmath28 kms@xmath3 , representing emission from local galactic gas , the iv arch close to core iv19 ( kuntz & danly 1996 ) in the lower galactic halo , and high - velocity cloud complex c near the ciii - c core ( giovanelli , verschuur & cram 1973 ) , respectively .",
    "the local galactic hi emission component is weak because the direction @xmath0 , @xmath29 lies close to the `` lockman hole '' , the region with the smallest amount of local hi in the northern hemisphere ( lockman , jahoda , & mccammon 1986 ) .",
    "this makes the analysis of the intermediate- and high - velocity material along this sight - line less complicated than in other directions because 1 ) the local component is not confused with absorption at intermediate velocities , and 2 ) local h@xmath30 absorption , which can blanket a significant portion of the uv spectrum below @xmath31 , is weak .",
    "there are substantial differences in the three emission profiles shown in figure  1 resulting from the different instrumental resolutions of the data and beam - smearing effects .",
    "we adopt the highest resolution ( effelsberg ) data , yielding n ( ) = @xmath32 @xmath21 for the local galactic component at @xmath33 kms@xmath3 , @xmath34 @xmath21 for the iv arch at @xmath4 kms@xmath3 , and @xmath35 @xmath21 for complex c at @xmath28 kms@xmath3 ( wakker et al.2001 ) .",

    "intergalactic absorption detected in the fuse and stis data will be discussed in a future paper . for the present study",
    ", it is sufficient to note that these igm features do not affect the analysis of the absorption associated with complex c and the iv arch presented in this paper .",
    "fuse is equipped with four co - aligned optical channels ( 2 sic channels for 905 - 1105  and 2 lif channels for 1000 - 1187  ) and two microchannel plate detectors .",
    "a detailed description of the fuse instrument and its on - orbit performance is given by moos et al.(2000 ) and sahnow et al.(2000 ) .",
    "the fuse observations of pg1259 + 593 were obtained on 25 february 2000 , 25 december 2000 , and 29 january 2001 through the large apertures ( lwrs , @xmath42 ) of the four channels and were recorded in photon address mode .",
    "sixty - four exposures totaling @xmath43 ks .",
    "are available for all four channels , although the light of the quasar was not optimally centered in all of the apertures throughout the observations and the detector high voltage was down during part of one observation .",
    "table 1 provides an overview of the fuse observations of pg1259 + 593 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the raw time - tagged photon list was required to eliminate small event bursts of unknown origin from the raw data ( see sahnow et al.2000 ) .",
    "the data were extracted using the standard fuse calibration pipeline calfuse ( v1.8.7 ) available at the johns hopkins university , and the individual exposures for each channel were coadded using a cross - correlation technique to remove small relative wavelength shifts between exposures .",
    "the pipeline corrects for geometrical distortions in the detector grid , the doppler shifts introduced by the motions of earth and satellite through space , and small spectral shifts due to thermally - induced motions of the diffraction gratings .",
    "this version of the pipeline does not correct for fixed - pattern noise or the spatial curvature of the lines introduced by the astigmatism of the optical system , which degrades the spectral resolution slightly at most wavelengths . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , the data were rebinned over 5 pixels , resulting in @xmath44 kms@xmath3 wide bins .",
    "no additional smoothing was applied .",
    "the velocity resolution of the combined fuse data is @xmath45 kms@xmath3 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the average flux in the spectrum is @xmath46 erg@xmath21s@xmath3@xmath3 , equivalent to an average s / n of @xmath44 per ( rebinned ) pixel element .",
    "stis observations of pg1259 + 593 were carried out on 1719 january 2001 with the intermediate - resolution far - uv echelle grating ( e140 m ) and the @xmath47 slit .",
    "thirty - four exposures totaling 81 ksec were obtained . in this observing mode , stis provides a resolution of 7 km s@xmath3 ( fwhm ) and wavelength coverage from @xmath481150 to 1730   with only five small gaps between orders at @xmath49 1634  .",
    "we reduced the data with the stis investigation definition team ( idt ) version of calstis at the goddard space flight center .",
    "the individual spectra were flatfielded , extracted , and wavelength and flux calibrated with the standard procedures .",
    "the stis idt correction for scattered light was then applied , and the individual spectra were co - added weighted by their inverse variances averaged over a large , high signal - to - noise region .",
    "finally , overlapping regions of adjacent orders were co - added with weighting based on inverse variance . for further information on the design and on - orbit performance of stis ,",
    "see woodgate et al.(1998 ) and kimble et al.(1998 ) .",
    "the fuse and stis absorption profiles were continuum - normalized by fitting low - order polynomials to the data ; a selection of normalized profiles is shown in figure.1 .",
    "( for display purposes only , we have rebinned the stis data in this figure to @xmath44 kms@xmath3 wide pixel elements , similar to the fuse data . )",
    "we measured equivalent widths for the weakly ionized species in the hvc and ivc gas by fitting single gaussian profiles to the main absorption components at @xmath28 kms@xmath3 ( complex c ) , @xmath4 kms@xmath3 ( iv arch ) , and for the ivc at @xmath7 kms@xmath3 . for every line in the fuse bandpass ,",
    "equivalent widths were measured independently using data for the two highest s / n channels , and then the values were averaged with weights proportional to the inverse squares of the respective errors .",
    "wavelengths , oscillator strengths ( morton 1991 ; 2001 , in preparation ) , and equivalent widths ( and 1@xmath50 errors ) for all measured lines are listed in table 2 .",

    "for the determination of column densities we made use of a standard curve - of - growth technique .",
    "metal line absorption from weakly ionized species associated with complex c is detected near @xmath28 kms@xmath3 in cii , ciii , ni , oi , alii , siii , sii , and feii . weak lines from other species ( e.g. , ari @xmath51 and pii @xmath52 ) are not detected at complex c velocities , but @xmath53 upper limits were derived ( see table 2 ) .",
    "measurements of the equivalent widths of cii , ciii , and siiii in complex c are not possible since these strong lines extend over the entire velocity range between @xmath54 to @xmath55 kms@xmath3 ( see figure1 ) .",
    "the strong lines of oxygen , silicon , and iron exhibit an asymmetry in the red wing of their absorption profiles , implying the presence of a weak absorption component near @xmath56 kms@xmath3 .",
    "multiple complex c components have also been observed toward other background sources ( e.g. , mrk876 , see gibson et al.2001 ) , where hi emission and absorption by weakly ionized species arises in at least two distinct components between @xmath57 and @xmath58 kms@xmath3 .",
    "the present pg1259 + 593 data do not allow us to analyze the two absorptions separately for all species , so we will consider the effect of this weak component on our column density determinations by examining its effect on the and lines observed by stis .",
    "the present effelsberg hi 21 cm emission data do not give any guidance as to the existence of multiple hi emission components , but it is possible to include a narrow , weak ( log @xmath59()@xmath60 ) emission component at @xmath61 kms@xmath3 without a noticeable change in the observed profile .",
    "all of the complex c lines from weakly ionized species collectively fit a single - component curve of growth with @xmath62 kms@xmath3 ( figure2 ) , suggesting that the velocity - dispersion parameter is determined by turbulent motions .",
    "there is a systematic trend for the stronger lines ( e.g. , oi @xmath63 ) to favor a higher @xmath64-value than the weak lines , supporting the idea that in this direction complex c consists of two or more unresolved subcomponents .",
    "column densities and gas - phase abundances relative to the solar values ( anders & grevesse 1989 ; grevesse & noels 1993 ) were derived by fitting the data to a single - component curve of growth with @xmath65 kms@xmath3 ; they are presented in table 3 along with their respective @xmath66 errors .    to estimate the influence of a possible unresolved subcomponent at @xmath61 kms@xmath3 on the complex c column densities , we have created composite apparent column density profiles ( see savage & sembach 1991 ) for the strong absorption lines of oxygen and silicon in the stis data .",
    "a weak component at @xmath67 kms@xmath3 is clearly visible . simulating the influence of this component on the overall complex c line profile",
    ", we find that such a component modifies the curve of growth of the main component in a very gentle manner , and the resulting curve is very similar to the curve of growth with @xmath65 kms@xmath3 , derived from our single - component gaussian fitting analysis .",
    "we estimate an uncertainty of @xmath68 dex ( 12% ) for the abundances in complex  c due to the existence of this unresolved absorption component ( note that this uncertainty is not included in the formal errors cited in table 3 ) .",
    "the presence of this subcomponent does not significantly alter the conclusions of our abundance study of complex c.    all elements considered in this study have normalized gas - phase abundances defined by [ @xmath69/h ] @xmath70 log(@xmath71log(@xmath69/h)@xmath72 dex , except phosphorus , for which only a @xmath53 upper limit of @xmath73 could be derived .",
    "comments regarding the limits for ari and feii are found in subsequent paragraphs .",
    "the normalized interstellar gas - phase abundances for all measured species in complex c are shown in figure3 .",
    "an accurate measure for the mean metallicity in the ism is the oi / hi ratio ; oxygen is not significantly depleted onto dust grains ( meyer et al.1998 ) and the oi / hi ratio is not altered by ionization effects ( i.e. , ( / ) @xmath74 ( o / h ) ) .",
    "this is because oi and hi have similar ionization potentials and both elements are strongly coupled through charge exchange interactions ( e.g. , sofia & jenkins 1998 ) . for complex c ,",
    "we find [ o / h]@xmath75 , equivalent to @xmath76 times the solar ( o / h ) ratio .",
    "the value agrees very well with the low sulfur abundance found toward mrk 290 ( wakker et al.1999 ) , but is significantly lower than the sulfur and iron abundances derived from sii and feii toward mrk 279 , mrk 501 , mrk 817 , and mrk 876 ( gibson et al.2001 ; murphy et al.2000 ) . for sii",
    "we find [ s / h]@xmath77 .",
    "thus , the inferred normalized gas - phase abundance of sulfur is significantly higher than for oxygen , but sii exists in regions were hydrogen is both neutral and ionized . assuming that the sulfur - to - oxygen ratio in complex c is the same as in local galactic gas and that the residual difference in the measured values is caused by sii in ionized gas along the sight line",
    ", we estimate an average degree of ionization of h@xmath78/(h@xmath79+h@xmath80 and @xmath59(h@xmath81h@xmath82h@xmath83 @xmath21",
    ".    if uv radiation is the major source of ionization in complex  c , it would be straight forward to explain the non - detection of neutral argon because has a large photoionization cross section ( sofia & jenkins 1998 ) . comparing to , we find [ ar / h]@xmath84 , but it is possible that the actual value for [ ar / h ] is significantly _ higher _ , if most of the ar is in the form of arii . for similar reasons ,",
    "a significant fraction of the nitrogen may also be ionized , which could account for the very low normalized abundance based on ( [ n / h]@xmath85 ) .",
    "the nii @xmath86 absorption profile observable with fuse is consistent with a strength of @xmath87 m  required to correct the the total nitrogen abundance up to 0.1 solar .",
    "however , this line has low s / n and it is blended by feii @xmath88 .",
    "we derive an upper limit of @xmath89 m(@xmath53 ) for nii absorption at complex c velocities .",
    "although the normalized gas - phase abundances derived for o , al , si , s , and fe are consistent with a single value to within the errors , the data show weak evidence for a slight underabundance of iron in comparison to the other elements .",
    "we find [ si / h]@xmath90 and [ al / h]@xmath91 , and [ fe / h]@xmath92 , based on the data for siii , alii , and feii .",
    "the abundance of al is derived from a single saturated line ( @xmath93 ) and therefore has a relatively large error bar . in the local interstellar medium ,",
    "si , al , and fe are all depleted into dust grains and their gas - phase abundance is significantly lower than that of mildly depleted species , such as o ( e.g. , savage & sembach 1996 ) . for complex c , however , we find [ si / h]@xmath74 [ al / h]@xmath74[o / h ] , indicating that silicon and aluminum are probably not incorporated into dust grains in complex c if the ionization corrections for and are modest . while the ionization potentials for siii and feii are almost identical , the photoionization cross section of feii is much higher than that of siii once the ionizing photons exceed an energy of @xmath94 ev ( see figure3 in sofia & jenkins 1998 ) . thus , its appears plausible that a significant fraction of the missing iron is in feiii because of ionizing radiation at high energies .",
    "we can check on the amounts of doubly ionized species in complex  c. siiii @xmath95 absorption is present at complex c velocities in the stis spectrum , but this line can not be used to derive a siiii column density because the three velocity components are heavily overlapping ( see figure1 ) . the feiii @xmath96 line is observed by fuse but it is blended by galactic feii @xmath97 ( figure1 ) . estimating the strength of the blending feii @xmath97 absorption by comparing with feii @xmath98 ( the two lines have similar values of log @xmath99  see table2 ) yields a galactic feii component strength of @xmath100 m .",
    "the equivalent width of galactic feii @xmath97 plus feiii @xmath96 at @xmath28 kms@xmath3 has a very similar strength , suggesting that there is no significant feiii absorption at complex  c velocities ( @xmath101 m  ( @xmath102 ) ) .",
    "we derive log @xmath59(feiii)@xmath103 and [ ( feii@xmath104feiii)/hi ] @xmath105 , or 0.24 dex lower than [ si / h ] based solely on .",
    "therefore , the apparently low abundance of iron in complex c is not likely to result from ionization effects .",
    "more likely , a low iron abundance in complex c could be due to depletion of iron into fe - rich dust grains . as discussed by savage & sembach ( 1996 ) ,",
    "dust - phase abundance measurements of galactic halo clouds indicate the presence of dust cores that contain mg and fe but do not contain much si .",
    "an alternative , and perhaps more speculative hypothesis , would be that a low iron abundance in complex  c reflects an overabundance of @xmath14 elements ( s , si , and o ) compared to iron .",
    "an enhanced abundance of @xmath14 elements in complex c has also been suggested for the mrk 876 , mrk 290 , and mrk 817 sight lines based upon comparisons of ni , sii , and feii column densities ( gibson et al.2001 ; murphy et al.2000 ) .",
    "however , considering that the abundances of iron and other elements are consistent _ within their error range _ , more accurate data is required to investigate the apparent iron deficiency in complex c on a statistically more reliable basis .    summarizing , we find that complex c has an overall abundance of @xmath480.1 solar in the direction of pg1259 + 593 , strongly supporting the idea that complex c has an origin outside the milky way .",
    "additional high quality data for other sight lines may help to quantify the abundance pattern in complex c and determine whether the apparent abundance variations seen in complex c by gibson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and the apparent iron deficiency toward pg1259 + 593 are intrinsic in nature or due to a combination of effects ( e.g. , nucleosynthetic history , ionization , dust ) .",
    "absorption lines of weakly ionized metals cii , ciii , ni , oi , alii , siii , siiii , sii , and feii are detected at the velocity of the iv arch ( @xmath4 kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "absorption lines of ari and pii are not detected .",

    "figure3 provides an overview of normalized interstellar gas - phase abundances in the iv arch ( see also  4 ) .",
    "the oxygen abundance in the iv arch is [ o / h]@xmath108 , or @xmath109 solar , in striking contrast to the low oxygen abundance for complex c derived in the previous section .",
    "the sulfur abundance ( derived from sii ) is slightly higher , [ s / h]@xmath110 , suggesting an ionization fraction of h@xmath78/(h@xmath79+h@xmath111 using the same line of reasoning in  4 . similar to complex c , argon and nitrogen are very underabundant in comparison to oxygen and sulfur ( [ ar / h]@xmath112 and [ n / h]@xmath113 , based on the data for ari and ni ) .",
    "these low abundances are most likely due to photoionization since neither argon nor nitrogen is readily incorporated into dust .",
    "low argon and nitrogen abundances have been seen also in other intermediate - velocity clouds ( e.g. , richter et al.2001 ) .",
    "abundances for silicon ( siii ) and iron ( feii ) are [ fe / h ] = @xmath114 dex and [ si / h ] = @xmath115 , suggesting relatively mild depletions into dust grains .",
    "the nearly solar abundances and the @xmath116-height bracket of @xmath22 kpc suggest that the iv arch has its origin in the milky way disk , for instance as part of a galactic fountain ( shapiro & field 1976 ; houck & bregman 1990 ) .",
    "the abundances derived here agree well with those for the lliv arch toward pg0804 + 761 ( richter et al.2001 ) .",
    "the fuse and stis data of pg1259 + 593 therefore suggest that the iv arch and complex c have completely different origins .",
    "the strong absorption lines of oi , cii , ciii , alii , siii , siiii , and feii reveal the presence of another ivc component at _ positive _ velocities near + 60 kms@xmath3 .",
    "absorption at positive velocities is not expected for interstellar gas participating in galactic rotation in this direction .",
    "equivalent widths for this absorption component are listed in table 2 .",
    "neither the effelsberg nor the green bank hi data show emission at @xmath7 kms@xmath3 , suggesting that the hi column density is below the detection limit .",
    "another possibility is that the diameter of this cloud is very small and that beam - smearing effects make this component undetectable in hi emission .",
    "the effelsberg data yield a @xmath102 upper limit of @xmath59(hi)@xmath117 @xmath21 for this ivc .",
    "hi absorption in the higher lyman lines ( ly@xmath118 and higher ) may be present , but blending with the galactic hi component and other lines in combination with low s / n at these wavelengths prevents any useful quantitative analysis of the hi absorption .",
    "thus , it is impossible to determine abundances for this ivc with the present data .",
    "in addition to the weakly ionized species , absorption lines of civ @xmath119 , siiv @xmath120 , and ovi @xmath121 are seen in both complex c and the iv arch .",
    "this is the second detection of ovi in complex c ( see murphy et al.2000 for the profiles toward mrk876 ) .",

    "ovi absorption at negative velocities might also be present in the other ovi line at @xmath122 , but is blended by galactic h@xmath30@xmath123r(1 ) .",
    "the high ion absorption at complex c velocities suggests the presence of a highly ionized boundary of complex c caused by interaction with surrounding material in the galactic halo ( e.g. , sembach et al.2000 ; murphy et al.2000 ) .",
    "the fuse spectrum of pg1259 + 593 shows the diverse nature of intermediate- and high - velocity clouds in the halo of the milky way .",
    "absorption line data obtained so far suggest that ivcs generally tend to have abundances similar to those in the disk of the milky way ( for a summary see wakker 2001 ) .",

    "metallicities of @xmath11 solar , as found for complex c in this study and others ( e.g. , wakker et al.1999 ) , indicate that metal - deficient gas is falling into the milky way halo .",

    "( lu et al.1998 ; gibson et al.2000 ; sembach et al.2001 ) has abundances similar to that of the smc and probably is the result of tidal interaction between the milky way and the smc .",
    "high - velocity cloud complex c remains one of the most interesting cases of galactic high - velocity gas investigated so far .",
    "our [ o / h ] abundance for complex c agrees well with the [ s / h ] abundance found by wakker et al.(1999 ) toward mrk290 , but studies of other sight lines suggest that there might be significant abundance variations in complex  c ( gibson et al.2001 ; murphy et al.2000 ) .",
    "the data obtained so far suggests that there might be a slight over - abundance of @xmath14 elements in comparison to iron in complex  c. with this study , an abundance pattern including eight elements ( n , o , al , si , p , s , ar , and fe ) is now available for comparison with other sight lines .",
    "further investigations of complex c , in particular the study of its deuterium and molecular hydrogen content , may help to understand the abundances derived in this paper .    this work is based on data obtained for the the guaranteed time team by the nasa - cnes - csa fuse mission operated by the johns hopkins university .",
