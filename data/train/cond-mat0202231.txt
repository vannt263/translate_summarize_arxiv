    "lattice - gas automata ( lga ) , as introduced by frisch , hasslacher , and pomeau @xcite , are ideal testing systems for kinetic theory .",
    "although they have a simple structure , which makes them extremely efficient simulation tools , they still address the full many - body particle problem .",
    "much of the efficiency originates from the discretization of the positions and velocities of the point - like particles onto a lattice .",
    "the simplified dynamics is a cyclic process : a streaming step , where all particles propagate to neighboring lattice sites , followed by a local collision step .",
    "the collisions typically conserve mass and momentum , and in addition energy if the model under consideration is thermal .",
    "lattice - gases are capable of simulating macroscopic fluid flow  @xcite , and can be used for studying flow through porous media  @xcite , immiscible multicomponent fluids  @xcite , reaction - diffusion  @xcite , von karman streets  @xcite , rayleigh - bnard convection  @xcite , interfaces and phase transitions  @xcite . however , there are practical problems when using lga s : the models are not galilean - invariant , temperature is not well - defined , the transport coefficient have unexpected behavior as a function of temperature and density , and many models contain spurious invariants  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore difficult to make connections with realistic systems .",
    "although in the early years the lga s were thought to seriously compete with other fluid flow solvers , the main line of research has shifted to a testing ground for concepts in kinetic theory .",
    "the main motivation for this paper lies in the exploration of the limits of thermal lattice - gas capabilities concerning diffusion - like phenomena .",
    "diffusion can be incorporated in lga s in several ways .",
    "the computational most efficient method is the _ color mixture _",
    "@xcite , which we have analyzed in detail for a thermal model  @xcite .",
    "the otherwise identical particles are in such a mixture painted with a probability corresponding to the concentration and a color - blind observer would not notice any difference , i.e. all transport properties are the same as for the single - component fluid .",
    "but in addition there is an extra hydrodynamical and color - dependent diffusion mode that does not interfere with the other modes .    in this paper",
    "we consider a different way to include diffusion , namely the regular binary mixture  @xcite . in the regular binary mixture",
    "one has two distinct species of particles , i.e. different mass . for particles of the same species the exclusion principle holds and hence there can be at most one particle of a given species in any velocity channel .",
    "there is , however , no mutual exclusion for particles off different species .",
    "consequently , a given velocity channel can be occupied by two particles , provided they both belong to a different species .",
    "one can interpret this as each species living on its own but identical lattice with exclusion .",
    "since each specie is restricted to its own lattice there can be no mass exchange between the two lattices and there is local mass conservation for both species . upon interaction , however , particles of both lattices corresponding to the same node are able to exchange momentum and energy , provided this does no violate local mass conservation and exclusion for each species . consequently , the dynamics of the regular binary mixture is much more involved than that of the color mixture , but it is closer to the dynamics of real fluids . for simplicity",
    "we here will assume the special case of the two species having the same physical properties , i.e. the same mass , and distinguish both species by a different color label .",
    "we analyze the model at the microscopic level and focus mainly on the behavior of the power spectrum .",
    "the coupling between energy transport and diffusion that arises in these systems , results in a more complicated structure of the power spectrum @xcite , in which the central peak now contains combined effects of both entropy fluctuations and concentration fluctuations .",
    "macroscopically this coupling manifests itself as the dufour effect ( a concentration gradient induces a heat - flow ) and the soret effect ( a temperature gradient induces a diffusion flux ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by introducing the regular binary thermal lattice gas model in section [ sec : model ] and use the molecular chaos assumption to obtain the linearized collision operator .",
    "section [ sec : mode analysis ] is concerned with a mode analysis of the linearized system , revealing the appearance of an extra diffusion mode .",
    "the modes related to thermal diffusivity and mass - diffusion are coupled and form two non - propagating , diffusive modes .",
    "furthermore , in section [ sec : landau - placzek ] we derive a landau - placzek analogue , a formula which describes the power spectrum in the hydrodynamic limit ( long wavelength , small frequency domain ) , which we check with simulation results performed on this system in section [ sec : simulation ] . in the final section we give a brief overview of the main results and some concluding remarks .",
    "the lga model we like to consider here is a thermal model consisting of two different interacting species of particles with identical mass .",
    "they can be thought of to live on separate two - dimensional hexagonal lattices on which they propagate independently , but red and blue particles corresponding to the same node interact during the collision .",
    "the velocities are discretized and have a spatial layout as shown in figure [ fig : spatial layout ] .",
    "they are distributed over four rings : one ring contains a single null - velocity , and three rings each contain six velocities with magnitude @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the velocity set is of size @xmath3 , and equivalent to the gbl - model , proposed by grosfils , boon , and lallemand  @xcite .",
    "since the model under consideration is basically a combination of two gbl models , particles of different type ( red and blue ) can have the same velocity .",
    "however , there can not be more than a single particle of each type in a given velocity state .",
    "the multiple rings correspond each to a different energy level and are a necessary requirement in order to introduce thermal properties .",
    "this particular velocity set guarantees the absence of spurious invariants and results in macroscopically isotropic behavior @xcite .",
    "the state of a node can be specified by a set of boolean occupation numbers @xmath4 , denoting the presence or absence of a particle of type @xmath5 in velocity channel @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a label running over all 19 velocities . due to the boolean nature of the lga ,",
    "the ensemble average of the occupation numbers @xmath8 in equilibrium , is described by a fermi - dirac distribution @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are lagrange multipliers and fixed by setting the value of the average red density @xmath14 , the average blue density @xmath15 ( or alternatively the total density @xmath16 and the fraction @xmath17 of red particles ) , the average velocity @xmath18 , and the energy density @xmath19 . here ,",
    "@xmath12 is the inverse temperature , @xmath10 and @xmath11 fulfill a chemical potential role , and @xmath20 is a parameter conjugate to the flow velocity . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the global zero - momentum case by putting @xmath21 .",
    "the lattice - gas boltzmann equation , describing the time - evolution of the average occupation numbers , is given by  @xcite @xmath22 where the nonlinear collision term @xmath23 is a summation over all pre - and post - collision states @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 the collision rules that are used are taken in to account by the transition matrix @xmath27 , which contains the probability that on collision a state is transformed into an `` equivalent '' state .",
    "we denote the collection of states that can be transformed into each other by an equivalence class @xmath28 , i.e. a class having the same red mass @xmath29 , the same blue mass @xmath30 , the same momentum @xmath31 , and the same energy @xmath32 .",
    "we adopt maximal collision rules , i.e. under collision a state can transform in any other state within the same equivalence class , including itself , thus fulfilling all conservation laws .",
    "hence @xmath33 , where we use @xmath34 to denote the number of elements in the class @xmath35 .",
    "the density and energy density enter the collision operator through @xmath36 , the probability of occurrence of state @xmath24 in equilibrium . in the boltzmann approximation",
    ", the velocity channels are assumed to be independent , hence @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37    if the velocity fluctuations are sufficiently small a taylor expansion of the collision term in the neighborhood of the equilibrium distribution is justified  @xcite , yielding the linearized collision operator @xmath38 @xmath39 where the diagonal matrix @xmath40 is determined by @xmath41 , which is the variance in the occupation number of a channel with the corresponding labels .",
    "it can easily be checked from eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegakappa ] ) that @xmath42 is a symmetric @xmath43 matrix .",
    "in contrast with the colored lga @xcite , @xmath44 is a 38-dimensional diagonal matrix due to the fact that there is no mutual exclusion of a red and blue particle with the same velocity .",
    "it also enables us to introduce the colored thermal scalar product @xcite , @xmath45 where we adopt the convention that the matrix @xmath44 is attached to the right vector .",
    "in first approximation the behavior of the system can be obtained by considering the fluctuations @xmath46 and analyze these deviations from the uniform equilibrium state in terms of eigenmodes .",
    "the solutions of the boltzmann equation ( [ eq : nonlinearboltzmannequation ] ) are then of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 represents the eigenvalue of the mode @xmath49 at wavevector @xmath50 .",
    "the hydrodynamic modes are related to the collisional invariants and satisfy @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "there are five independent collision invariants @xmath53 corresponding to the conservation of the red and blue mass , the conservation of momentum , and the conservation of energy @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and can be combined to form @xmath58 ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the analogue to the microscopic entropy for the gbl model  @xcite and @xmath61 the speed of sound following from the orthogonality requirement @xmath62 .",
    "the remaining invariant @xmath63 is , contrary to the one in the colored gbl model @xcite , not simply the weighted difference between the red and blue densities @xmath64 , but is given by @xmath65 this form is determined by the requirement that it is orthogonal to the four other invariants . in the case of equal red and blue density the last term on the righthand side vanishes , but in general this is not the case .",
    "the origin of this term is in fact the absence of equipartition in this model due to the exclusion principle , which causes the ratio @xmath66 to be dependent on the velocity of the particles as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fermidirac ] ) .",
    "note that this last invariant is also perpendicular to the density , i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "other useful relations between these invariants are @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    the choice of @xmath60 and @xmath63 made here is based on the correspondence of the definition of @xmath60 with the one made for the gbl model and its colored counterpart @xcite . since @xmath60 nor @xmath63 , with the exception of some special limits , is going to be the zeroth order of an eigenmode the choice is somewhat arbitrary and any two linear combinations that are mutual orthogonal could be used as well .",
    "the current choice , however , will facilitate us to make a connection with continuous theory and the proper transport coefficients .",
    "note that this is similar to what is done in the case of continuous theory and generalized versions of hydrodynamics ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) , where one also needs to obtain a set of variables that are statistically independent based on thermodynamic fluctuation theory .",

    "this is for convenience , since strictly speaking @xmath60 and @xmath63 will in general not be the source of an eigenfunction , but both will be a linear combination of two `` true '' modes of the system .    with the introduction of these currents it follows immediately from eqns .",
    "( [ eq : invariantequation ] ) and ( [ eq : order - one ] ) that invariants and currents are orthogonal @xmath109 hence the currents lie in the complement of the null - space .",
    "since this is not affected by applying @xmath38 we obtain @xmath110 for any integer @xmath94 , including negative values .",
    "note that for negative values of @xmath94 the expression @xmath111 is uniquely determined by the requirement that the result has no component in the null - space .",

    "note that at this stage three of the zeroth order eigenfunctions and their corresponding currents are still undetermined .    in the space of @xmath63 , @xmath60 , and",

    "hence the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath125 need to vanish , which could already be seen from eq .",

    "( [ eq : invariantbasis ] ) and ( [ eq : invariant - d ] ) .",
    "consequently one obtains @xmath139 , which is an illustration of the decoupling of entropy and concentration fluctuations in this limit .",
    "in general , however , these two `` true '' transport coefficients do not seem to correspond with a conventional transport coefficient , but rather they always appear in combination with each other , and it is only in the appropriate limits that they reduce to the thermal diffusivity and diffusion coefficient .",
    "this is completely in agreement with the results known for the continuous theory @xcite , where the coupling of fluctuations in concentration and entropy results in the same effect .    in the present model , however , there is some ambiguity in the choice made for the basic invariants .",
    "to arrive at this last formula it was only necessary to assume that the invariants @xmath60 and @xmath63 , are mutually orthogonal , and span a 2-dimensional subspace in the null - space which is perpendicular to @xmath140 , @xmath105 , and @xmath141 .",
    "a good choice necessarily leads to the proper modes in the fully known limit of one specie .",
    "although this puts some limitations on the possible choices it will not uniquely fix the basis .",
    "the present choice for @xmath60 in ( [ eq : invariantbasis ] ) is however the most natural extension of the conventional formulation @xcite and we will refer to @xmath131 as being the generalized thermal diffusivity .",
    "this problem is more easily identified in the diffusion - like mode @xmath63 . in the present formulation ( [ eq : invariant - d ] ) , it contains in general a contribution proportional to @xmath141 , rather than being a weighted difference of the red and blue densities only as found in the colored gbl model @xcite .",
    "this already suggests that this vector is not the proper generalization of the self - diffusion mode .",
    "this is consistent with the continuous theory @xcite , where the analogue of the @xmath142 also depend on more than the thermal diffusivity and diffusion only .",
    "we will address this subject again in a later section .",
    "similar to the case of the gbl model we can introduce @xmath143 , the ratio of specific heats by @xmath144 with @xmath145 the adiabatic speed of sound , @xmath146 the isothermal speed of sound .",
    "two additional useful definitions are @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "these allow us to rewrite the currents related to the sound modes as @xmath149 .",
    "consequently this leads to @xmath150 from symmetry considerations it follows that @xmath151 and @xmath152 because of the isotropy of the lattice , we obtain the following relation for the main transport coefficients @xmath153    an example of the full wave - vector dependent real eigenvalue spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenvalue ] , which also confirms the absence of spurious invariants . of all eigenvalues only the five related to the hydrodynamic modes go to zero in the limit @xmath154 .",
    "it is with these modes that the binary - mixture responds to deviations from thermal equilibrium @xmath155 the first two eigenvalues describe sound propagation in the two opposite directions parallel to @xmath50 with @xmath156 the adiabatic sound speed , the third eigenvalue describes the shear mode , and the last two eigenvalues represent purely diffusive , non - propagating processes . in this hydrodynamic regime",
    "characterized by @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the mean free path length , one can exploit the fact that the real component of the eigenvalues of the hydrodynamic modes is much smaller than that of the kinetic modes .",
    "we will use this in the next section in order to obtain the landau - placzek formula ( [ eq : fulllp ] ) for the power spectrum .    for larger wavevectors ( here roughly @xmath159 )",
    "the relations ( [ eq : zpm])-([eq : zspm ] ) start to deviate from the true values .",
    "this is the generalized hydrodynamic regime ( @xmath160 ) , and the transport coefficients become @xmath86 dependent .",
    "the hydrodynamic modes are , however , still smaller than the kinetic modes yielding a reasonable accurate landau - placzek formula . in the kinetic regime ( @xmath161 ) the hydrodynamic modes and kinetic modes become of the same order of magnitude .",

    "these two modes converge to the thermal diffusivity and diffusion , i.e. @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and is caused by the decoupling of the fluctuations in the concentrations and entropy . in our model",
    "this means that the ratio @xmath166 vanishes .",
    "the value of @xmath133 , however , will in general remain small but finite due to the divergencies of the transport coefficients in the low density limit of lga .",

    "this is actually also the case in the high density limit of fig .",

    "finally , decoupling can also be observed in the case @xmath175 .",
    "in fact this is a rather special limit and could be analyzed completely in a manner similar to the one used for the colored gbl model @xcite , because based on the symmetry of the problem one can decompose the linearized boltzmann operator in two type of contributions , i.e. @xmath176 and @xmath177 .    for @xmath178 the diffusion mode vanishes , since we then recover the original gbl model , but for @xmath179 the diffusion mode remains finite .",

    "here we have however an interesting difference with respect to light scattering experiments  @xcite . whereas in that case",
    "the sensitivity of the dielectric fluctuations with respect to density is much larger than with respect to temperature , the amplitude factors will differ orders of magnitude .",

    "the location of these points in terms of density and relative fractions , however , depends in a non - trivial way on the system parameters .",

    "finally we like to consider the spectra of the diffusive processes only . due to the nature of lga , however , it is not obvious how to define diffusion properly . on the one hand we have",
    "the requirement that a diffusive process is not propagating , on the other hand one expects the diffusion only to be related to the densities of both components in the mixture .",
    "as we will show in this section , it turns out that these two views are not completely compatible .    in the colored gbl model @xcite and in the continuous case",

    "this can easily be checked since the vector is in general not orthogonal to the two soundmodes due to the absence of equipartition .",
    "a simple solution is to subtract the propagating part by adding the appropriate term proportional to @xmath141 @xmath213 in a binary athermal mixture @xcite , however , it was suggested to use @xmath214 unfortunately this choice also leads to a propagating mode in the thermal case .",
    "one could again subtract the propagating part , but the result would be different from ( [ eq : diff-1 ] ) .",
    "the origin of this problem is that we have two different diffusive modes and any linear combination would lead to a diffusive spectrum .",
    "however , due to the lack of equipartition the different choices of fluctuations one wishes to consider do not coincide , not even after the propagating part is eliminated .",
    "naively one would expect a combination of the red and blue component only and in addition it should be perpendicular to the propagating modes .",
    "this leads to the following generalization of the athermal result ( [ eq : differnst ] ) , which in the case of an athermal model would coincide @xmath215 obviously there is some freedom here in order to choose the generalization of the diffusion .",
    "the natural extension would be one that that satisfies the appropriate limits .",
    "however , in the low density limit and in the limit @xmath216 , they all converge to the same value equal to the one found for the single component gbl model .",

    "this limit can be completely analyzed in a manner analogous to what is done for colored gbl model @xcite . for reasons of symmetry",

    "the number of states in that model was @xmath222 , since no red and blue particle could exist with the same velocity .",
    "the simulations could , however , be performed by realizing that the collisions could be separated in a normal gbl collision followed by a redistribution of the colors over the different particles present .",
    "these two separated processes can easily be performed by any computer .    in the present model",
    "this approach can not be used .",
    "one could of course make use of the symmetries present in the model .",
    "the hexagonal lattice leads to six rotations and two reflections .",
    "in addition we can make use of the interchange of red and blue particles , and the interchange of particles and holes . at best",
    "this would lead to a reduction with a factor of 48 on the total number of different states , but in practice this factor is less because a large fraction of the states is invariant with respect to some of these symmetries .",
    "this is however still too large in order to be applied in any but the largest supercomputers available at present .",
    "an alternative , but rather inefficient scheme , would be to store only part of the collision table and generate other collisions on the fly .",
    "binary mixtures , however , do allow for a more convenient solution , which is less efficient than storing the complete collision table , but still has a relative good performance ( about a factor 2 - 5 slower than the colored gbl model ) . rather than storing a collision table based on the states , we make one based on the different classes . in the gbl model there are @xmath223 different classes @xmath224 , characterized by the total mass , momentum , and energy .",
    "since the the binary mixture is the combination of two gbl models there are @xmath225 different combinations @xmath226 of a red and blue class which form a total of @xmath227 classes @xmath28 . if we combine this with the 48 symmetry operations we get a working algorithm that already can be used on a computer with 256 mb of memory .    an arbitrary input state is now analyzed in order to determine to which class @xmath35 it belongs . from its characterization",

    "the spectra can still accurately be described by the boltzmann approximation .",
    "the landau - placzek formula for a regular binary thermal mixture is quite similar in structure as the one for the continuous case .",
    "the main feature is a central peak formed by two lorentzians due to the coupled entropy - concentration fluctuations . in the limits of low density , single specie , their dual interpretations , and equal red and blue density it is possible for the central peak of the spectrum to be decomposed into two lorentzians with linewidths given by @xmath236 and @xmath237 ,",
