    "this paper aims to address the following question : _ given a diffeomorphism @xmath6 on a riemannian manifold @xmath4 subject to a small degenerate random perturbation , under what conditions can we guarantee that all the invariant measures for such a system are absolutely continuous with respect to the riemannian measure on @xmath4 and whether such conditions are satisfied for generic random perturbations of @xmath6 ? _    0.1 in    more precisely , let @xmath4 be a compact riemannian manifold and @xmath6 be a diffeomorphism on @xmath4 .",
    "a random perturbation of @xmath6 is defined as a markov chain on @xmath4 such that for every @xmath7 , the transition probability distribution @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath9 is a probability distribution that depends only on @xmath10 and is not far from the point mass at @xmath10 .",
    "intuitively it means that a particle jumps from @xmath7 to @xmath10 and then disperses randomly near @xmath10 with the distribution @xmath9 .    assuming @xmath9 depends continuously on @xmath7 , such markov chains admit stationary probability measures .",
    "we will refer to these stationary measures as _",
    "invariant measures_. if we denote the riemannian measure on @xmath4 by @xmath11 , an important question to ask is whether the system admits invariant measures absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "the answer to this question is straightforward if we assume that @xmath12 are absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath11 ( i.e. have a density ) for every @xmath7 .",
    "given the absolute continuity of transitional probabilities , every invariant measure of the perturbed dynamics is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "interesting problems arise for degenerate random perturbations in which the probability distributions @xmath9 do not necessarily have densities . in many real systems",
    ", perturbations do not occur everywhere or uniformly in all directions .",
    "frequently , irregular patches on the domain may introduce random patterns or perturbations can occur on the boundary . for discrete time systems , it is also natural for the @xmath9 to have bounded or even small support , making the problem of uniqueness of invariant densities rather delicate .",
    "the analogous problem for continuous - time systems , i.e. for stochastic differential equations with degenerate stochastic noise has been extensively studied .",
    "theorem @xcite states that if a certain combination of lie brackets of the vector fields involved in the differential operator generate the whole space , then the system supports an absolutely continuous stationary measure .",
    "even though the formalism is well - established , a good understanding of what types of dynamics give rise to hypoellipticity in the sde setting is not well understood . on the other hand ,",
    "no comparable result exists for discrete - time dynamical systems so far .",
    "the purpose of this investigation is to study the invariant measures for random perturbations of anosov diffeomorphisms when @xmath9 is _ localized _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath9 is supported on a bounded set for all @xmath7 , and _ degenerate _ , i.e. @xmath9 is not absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "the localization prevents reaching everywhere `` in one step and therefore makes it possible for invariant measures to be supported on small sets ( compared to the scale of the phase space ) .",
    "the degeneracy may prevent invariant measures from being absolutely continuous with respect to the riemannian measure @xmath11 and potentially create too many '' of them .    for definiteness ,",
    "this paper focuses on uniform rank @xmath1 random perturbations , i.e. when @xmath9 are uniform distributions on @xmath1-dimensional disks obtained from @xmath1 vector fields .",
    "such a restriction is not essential for many general properties of the perturbed system , but allows to describe things more precisely .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section 1 we provide background information on the subject of random perturbations ; in sections 2 , 3 and 4 we study rank @xmath5 random perturbations ; and in section 5 we generalize the results obtained in section 2,3 , and 4 for rank @xmath1 random perturbations .",
    "more precisely , in section @xmath13 we discuss very general conditions that apply for rank 1 random perturbations of any @xmath3 diffeomorphism @xmath6 and guarantee absolute continuity of all invariant measures .",
    "however , these conditions do not provide an intuitive description of the relation between @xmath6 and the vector field along which the perturbation occurs .",
    "in section 3 we restrict @xmath6 to the class of @xmath3 anosov diffeomorphisms and aim to provide a different set of conditions that relate the vector field along which the perturbation occurs to certain @xmath6-invariant foliations .",
    "the conditions that guarantee absolute continuity of all invariant measures are obtained for two important subclasses of anosov diffeomorphisms : hyperbolic toral automorphisms and anosov diffeomorphisms with codimension 1 stable manifolds . in section 4",
    "we prove genericity of this these conditions .",

    "we consider a family @xmath16 such that @xmath17 is borel . given @xmath18 , by a random perturbation of @xmath6",
