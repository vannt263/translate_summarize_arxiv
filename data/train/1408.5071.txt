    "numerical studies in large wgmrs , however , pose a significant problem as even with today s computational possibilities full three - dimensional modeling is extremely difficult .",
    "a complete description for the far - field emission patterns from spheroidal wgmrs , as being experimentally investigated in this work , is still an open question in the field .",
    "in addition , the high number of experimentally accessible modes in large wgmrs makes mode analysis a very challenging task .",
    "several experimental methods for mode analysis have been studied in the past , such as near - field probing @xcite , far field imaging @xcite and investigating the spectral response of these resonators @xcite . regarding the breakthrough experiments mentioned earlier in the text ,",
    "an experimental characterization of a macroscopic - size wgmr mode structure has only been achieved in the context of optical sum - frequency generation @xcite on the basis of sideband spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this technique requires an optical probe coupled to the mode of interest at a wavelength that may not be available .",
    "furthermore , finding the mode of interest , e.g. the signal or idler down - converted mode , with the probe laser is experimentally challenging .",

    "the full information on these mode numbers is in principle contained in the far - field images of the outcoupled modes @xcite , and in the frequency spectrum @xcite .",
    "the exact identification of wgms can be extremely difficult in practice using only one of these approaches .    here",
    "we present a combination of these techniques that allows for a complete identification of all significantly coupled wgms of a large scale ( millimeter - sized ) wgmr .",

    "the manuscript is structured as follows : section one theoretically describes far - field emission patterns based on the electric field distributions of wgms .",
    "section two explains the mode spectrum of wgmrs via the dispersion relation . after a description of the experimental setup in section three , experimental results on the characterization of the wgmr , in particular mode analysis ,",

    "its polarization is parallel to the optic axis of the wgmr ( te mode ) .",
    "evanescent coupling to the disk is achieved by focusing the beam onto the inner surface of a diamond prism under an angle of total internal reflection ( see fig . [",

    "the transverse coupling angle was adjusted by maximizing coupling to equatorial modes .",

    "we use a second diamond prism for out - coupling to investigate the modes independently from this interference .",
    "the light emerging from the second prism is sent to a ccd camera placed at a distance of 1.4 cm from the coupling point , which gives us in a good approximation the far - field emission pattern .",
    "in our mode analysis technique , we combine the information from far - field emission patterns and from the frequency spectrum . in the first subsection mode numbers q and p are obtained from an analysis of the far - field emission patterns . in the second subsection a complementary analysis of the frequency differences @xmath57 from the fundamental wgm to higher - order wgms is performed to obtain the wgmr properties and the polar mode numbers @xmath0 .      as a first step , we tune the pump laser frequency over 14  ghz and",

    "optimized for equatorial modes using a tem@xmath62 laser beam , the excitation of modes with odd p is strongly suppressed ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , we expect to see only even numbers of p , whose coupling decreases rapidly for higher p. note that tilting the pump beam from the equatorial plane excites an increasing number of non - equatorial modes .",

    "[ fig : fsrmodespacing ] ) are approximately equal to the pump laser frequency , eq . implies that larger radial mode numbers q correspond to smaller numbers @xmath0 .",
    "hence , an increase in the radial mode number q results in a decrease in the out - coupling angle @xmath22 for equatorial wgms according to eq . .",

    "the measurements of the radii also agree well with the microscopically measured value .",
    "thermal expansion does not affect the wgmr radii within the accuracy of the microscope measurement .    in a final step ,",
    "the spectral characterization is carried out again at a different temperature of the wgm resonator within the same spectral observation window ( see fig . [",
    "fig : atlas](c ) ) .",
    "this results in a shift of the relative frequencies for all the modes within the spectrum ( see fig . [",
    "fig : atlas](b ) ) .",
    "a change in temperature effectively changes the resonator optical length , both through thermal expansion and the thermal change in the refractive index of lithium niobate .",
    "this changes the size parameter @xmath55 of the resonator .",
    "the change in the measured mode spectrum in the fixed spectral observation window can thus be directly related to a change in the @xmath0 number for each mode in the observation window by @xmath87 . in principle ,",
    "temperature tuning can also be used to obtain accurate information on the thermo - refractive and the thermal expansion coefficient . due to experimental uncertainties in the temperature determination , this is not possible here with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "in contrast , we use temperature tuning to demonstrate an efficient method for tailoring the frequency spectrum by choosing the proper @xmath0 number at a certain temperature .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated a practical experimental technique to identify mode numbers of all significantly coupled wgms within the spectral observation window by evaluating far - field emission patterns and frequency differences .",
    "this technique takes advantage of geometrical dispersion arising in wgms due to their curvature .",
    "therefore it is more efficient in application to small resonators .",
    "however , we have shown that the exact determination of the mode numbers is possible even in relatively large resonators .    apart from analyzing an unknown mode spectrum , the understanding of the frequency spectra",
    "can also be used to specifically tailor wgm spectra .",
    "in addition , this measurement technique allows for accurate measurements of the resonator radii @xmath4 and @xmath6 times refractive index @xmath3 .",
    "the determination of the optical circumference @xmath88 is mainly limited by the uncertainty of the laser frequency .",
    "this can be increased experimentally by orders of magnitude to allow very accurate measurements of either resonator geometry or refractive index .",
    "the large set of accurately characterized wgms can be employed to select wgms with specific spatial or spectral properties on demand for a huge variety of applications in classical and quantum optics .",
