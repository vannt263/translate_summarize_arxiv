    "<S> it is also absent in models where scalar particles are not fundamental but composite@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently a new kind , called little higgs ( lh ) model @xcite , which can solve the hierarchy problem was proposed . here </S>",
    "<S> the higgs is a pseudo - goldstone boson whose mass is protected by a global symmetry and , unlike supersymmetry , quadratic divergence cancellations are due to contributions from new particles with the same spin .    </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology of these models has been discussed with respect to indirect effects on precision measurements @xcite and direct production of the new particles introduced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since these early contributions , several variations have been proposed @xcite , but the cancellation of quadratic divergences is inherent to any lh model and this requires definite relations among certain couplings . therefore , any process that involves exclusively these couplings is a robust prediction of the lh mechanism regardless of model variations . </S>",
    "<S> one of such processes is double higgs production , which we study here .    </S>",
    "<S> after the spontaneous breakdown of a global underlying symmetry at a scale @xmath1 of a few tev , the model contains a large multiplet of pseudo - goldstone bosons , which includes the sm higgs doublet . while most members of the multiplet receive large masses ( of a few tev ) , the mass of the higgs boson is protected from quadratic divergences at one loop , and therefore remains naturally smaller . </S>",
    "<S> the cancellation is related to the existence of an extra ( heavier ) top - like quark and its interactions with the scalar sector , feature which is common to all little higgs models . </S>",
    "<S> higgs pair production at lhc is based on exactly the same diagrams that enter the quadratic divergence cancellation ( fig .  1 ) , except for the insertion of two gluons ( fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in order to work out the details , we make use of the littlest higgs model , which is a simple case but contains all the necessary features .    below the scale @xmath1 , the little higgs lagrangian @xcite can be written as a non - linear sigma model based on a coset @xmath2 symmetry : @xmath3 where the subgroup @xmath4 ^ 2 $ ] of @xmath5 is promoted to a local gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath6 . to exhibit the interactions </S>",
    "<S> , one can expand @xmath7 in powers of @xmath8 around its vacuum expectation value @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the doublet that will remain light and @xmath12 is a triplet under the unbroken @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - zero v.e.v . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 of the field leads to the breaking of global @xmath5 into @xmath14 and also breaks the gauge symmetry @xmath4 ^ 2 $ ] into its diagonal subgroup , which is identified with the standard model @xmath15 symmetry group .    </S>",
    "<S> the standard model fermions acquire their masses via the usual yukawa interactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to cancel the top quark quadratic contribution to the higgs self - energy , a new vector - like color triplet fermion pair , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with quantum numbers @xmath18 and @xmath19 must be introduced . since they are vector - like , they are allowed to have a bare mass term which is _ chosen _ such as to cancel the quadratic divergence above scale @xmath20 . accordingly , the standard top quark couples to the pseudo - goldstone bosons and heavy colored fermions in the littlest higgs model as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are antisymmetric tensors , and @xmath25 are parameters of order unity .    </S>",
    "<S> after ewsb , we write @xmath26 , and follow perelstein _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in defining left handed fields @xmath27 , @xmath28 and right handed fields @xmath29 , @xmath30 to obtain @xmath31 diagonalizing this mass matrix , we obtain the usual eigenvalues corresponding to the top quark @xmath32 and the heavy top @xmath33 masses , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , in terms of the scales @xmath36 and @xmath20 , and the couplings @xmath37 . from this analysis one </S>",
    "<S> also derives the couplings of the higgs to the top quarks @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( of left and right chirality ) , in terms of the same parameters . in an obvious notation , </S>",
    "<S> these couplings are denoted as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> one should be aware that , for real values of @xmath37 , the values of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath20 not only are related but also restricted to the condition :  @xcite    @xmath46    the relevant feynman diagrams for the higgs self - energy are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ quadratic ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the cancellation of tadpole diagrams requires that @xmath47 , whereas the cancellation of higgs self - energy quadratic divergences implies @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are satisfied up to terms of order @xmath49 by the masses and couplings defined above .    </S>",
    "<S> an important point to consider is that in the simplest lh models , strict bounds on the parameters exist . in particular , electroweak precision constraints require @xmath50 tev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a recent variation on the littlest higgs model , where a so - called t - parity that interchanges the two subgroups @xmath4_1 $ ] and @xmath4_2 $ ] of @xmath5 is introduced , this bound can be significantly lowered to @xmath51 gev @xcite . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the t - odd states do not participate in the cancellation of quadratic divergences and in this respect our calculation is valid in this model as well . </S>",
    "<S> t - parity also forbids the generation of a vacuum expectation value for the triplet scalar field ( i.e. , @xmath52 in the notation of t.  han _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite ) , which is one of the causes for easing the electroweak constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> gluon - gluon fusion is the dominant mechanism of sm higgs boson pair production at the lhc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude for @xmath53 process has contributions from triangle and box diagrams  @xcite , shown in fig .  [ triangles ] .    </S>",
    "<S> all these diagrams involve integrals that can be converted to passarino - veltmann functions , for which there are computer codes to evaluate them . here </S>",
    "<S> the expressions for the amplitudes in terms of passarino - veltman functions were computed using the package feyncalc @xcite and the numerical integration of these functions is done using looptools @xcite .    from the sum of all these diagrams and squaring , </S>",
    "<S> the partonic differential cross section is obtained ( we have included a factor of @xmath54 from identical particles in the final state ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 is averaged over all 32 initial color and helicity states . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath57 cross section at lhc is then obtained by convoluting this partonic cross section with the gluon distribution functions : @xmath58 \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\qquad\\qquad\\hat{\\sigma } ( gg \\to hh ) \\theta ( x_1 x_2 s - 4 m_h^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we used the set 3 of cteq6 leading gluon distribution function with momentum scale @xmath59 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath60 factor was included to take into account qcd corrections .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ result1 ] we plot the cross section for the double higgs production process at the lhc for fixed @xmath61 tev , a higgs boson mass in the range @xmath62@xmath63 gev and for @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 gev . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , we find that the largest deviations from the sm result occurs for small higgs boson mass and small decay constant @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> we also explored the dependence of this cross section on the mass of the heavy top quark and found that it slowly grows with @xmath35 , but promptly reaches an asymptotic value , becoming insensitive for @xmath67 tev . </S>"
