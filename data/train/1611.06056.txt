    "in the last two decades , complex network became a popular framework to investigate a large variety of real systems , including internet , social networks , biological networks and financial networks  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the complex network approach was found to be useful in studying of climate phenomena , using `` climate network''@xcite . in a climate network ,",
    "usually , nodes are chosen to be geographic locations and links are constructed based on the similarities between the time variability between pairs of nodes .",
    "climate networks have been used to quantify and analyze the structure and dynamics of the climate system  @xcite .",
    "moreover , climate networks have been used to better understand and even forecast some important climate phenomena , such as monsoon  @xcite , the north atlantic oscillation  @xcite and el nio  @xcite .",
    "el nio  is probably the most influential climate phenomenon on interannual time scales  @xcite . during el nio ,",
    "the eastern pacific ocean is getting warmer by several degrees , impacting the local and global climate .",
    "la nia   is cold anomaly over the el nio  region .",
    "the el nio  activity is quantified , for example , by the oceanic nio index ( oni ) , which is noaa s primary indicator for monitoring el nio  and la nia .",
    "el nio   can trigger many disruptions around the globe and in this way affect various aspects of human life .",
    "these include unusual weather conditions , droughts , floods , declines in fisheries , famine , plagues , political and social unrest , and economic changes .",
    "global impacts of el nio  had been investigated in by halpert et al  @xcite . however , the mechanism through which el nio  influences the global climate and the impact of el nio  are still not fully understood .",
    "here we propose a percolation framework analysis to describe the structure of the global climate system during el nio , based on climate networks .",
    "percolation theory is also used to analyze the behavior of connected clusters in a network @xcite .",
    "the applications of percolation theory covers many areas , such as , optimal path , directed polymers , epidemics , immunization , oil recovery , and nanomagnets . in the framework of percolation theory one",
    "may define phase transition based on simplest pure geometrical considerations .    in the present study",
    ", we construct a sequence of monthly - shifting - climate networks by adding links one by one according to the similarities between nodes .",
    "more specifically , the nodes which are more similar ( based on their temperature variations ) will be connected first .",
    "we statistically found that around one year prior to the onset of el nio , the climate network undergoes a first order phase transition ( i.e. , exhibiting a significant discontinuity in the order parameter ) , indicating that links with higher similarities tend to localize into two large clusters , in the higher latitudes of the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "however , during el nio  times , there is only one big cluster via tropical links .",
    "we find that indications the discontinuity in the order parameter is closely related to the oni .",
    "our analysis is based on the daily near surface ( @xmath2 hpa ) air temperature of era - interim reanalysis  @xcite .",
    "we pick 726 grid points that approximately homogeneously cover the entire globe  @xcite ; these grid points are chosen to be the nodes of our climate network . for each node ( i.e. , longitude - latitude grid point ) , daily values within the period 1979 - 2016",
    "are used , from which we subtract the mean seasonal cycle and divide by the seasonal standard deviation . specifically , given a record @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the year and @xmath5 stands the day ( from 1 to 365 ) , the filtered record is defined as , @xmath6 where `` mean '' and `` std '' are the mean and standard deviation of the temperature on day @xmath5 over all years .    to obtain the time evolution of the strengths of the links between each pair of nodes , we define , the time - delayed cross - correlation function as , @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the time lag between 0 and 200 days .",
    "note , that for estimating the cross - correlation function at day @xmath5 , only temperature data points prior to this day are considered .",
    "we then define the link s weight as the maximum of the cross - correlation function @xmath10 .",
    "in lattices model , a percolation phase transition occurs if the systems dimension is larger than one  @xcite .",
    "the system is considered percolating if there is a path from one side of the lattice to the other , passing through occupied bonds ( bond percolation ) or sites ( site percolation ) .",
    "the percolation threshold usually depends on the type and dimensionality of the lattice .",
    "however , for the network system no notion of side exists . for this reason ,",
    "a judgment condition to verify whether the system is percolating is the existence of a giant component ( cluster ) containing @xmath11 nodes , where @xmath12 is the total number nodes in the network .",
    "if two nodes are in the same cluster then there is at least one path passing through them .    in this section ,",
    "we discuss the construction of the climate networks , and study the evolution of clusters .",
    "initially , given @xmath13 isolate nodes , links are added one by one according to the link strength , i.e. , we first add the link with the highest weight , and continue selecting edges ordered by decreasing weight . during the evolution of our network",
    ", we measure the size of the normalized largest cluster @xmath14 and the susceptibility @xmath15 , where @xmath16 represents the size of the largest component .",
    "the susceptibility of the climate network ( the average size of the finite clusters ) is defined as  @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the average number of clusters of size @xmath19 at edge s weight @xmath20 , and the prime on the sums indicates the exclusion of the largest cluster in each measurement .    since our network is finite , we use the following procedure to find the percolation threshold .",
