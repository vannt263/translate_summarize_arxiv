    "the presence of cutoff dependence in the renormalization group ( rg ) flow equations is , however , problematic , since for a consistent rg method the rg invariance has to be part of the rg flow equations in order to have an universality behaviour @xcite .",
    "when a set of rg flow equations is independent of the energy scale cutoff , the corresponding fixed points are not restricted to a given cutoff choice .",
    "although the cutoff dependence in the case proposed , as we will show , is associated to a given choice of parameter , and consequently can be removed by reconsidering a more apropriate parameter . for the parameter proposed for the rg flow , the solutions can be changed by changing the choice of the cutoff contribution .    here we demonstrate that this cutoff dependence can be removed by rewriting the rg flow equations in terms of the energy scale variable @xmath5 . in our propose ,",
    "the rg flow equations assume a cutoff independent form and consequently the fixed points will be independent of cutoff choice .",
    "the consequence of this new form is the invariance of the rg flow under cutoff transformations , turning the problem more suitable for classification of universality classes .",
    "the rg flow equations then turn to be consistent with the rg methods with cutoff independent rg flow equations .",

    "since the rg flow equations in terms of @xmath5 do not carry a cutoff term , we have a consistent rg procedure in terms of this variable choice , whose profile of the rg flows stay invariant under the transformation @xmath31 .    in order to make this point more clear ,",

    "the fixed points are not equivalent .    in general , given a cutoff transformation @xmath38 , the rg equations in terms of the @xmath6 variable will change its form , while the rg equations in terms of @xmath5 will mantain the same form , carrying an universality property for the rg flow equations and consequently with an unique fixed point profile independent of the cutoff choice .",
    "in terms of the energy scale variable @xmath5 , the set of rg flow equations for the tccm can rewriten as follows @xmath39 where @xmath40 and now the cutoff contribution @xmath41 is in fact cutoff independent @xmath28 .",
