    "identifying the dominant physical processes that were responsible for the formation of the hubble sequence has been one of the major goals of galaxy formation for decades @xcite .",
    "morphological surveys of high - redshift galaxies , in particular utilizing the high angular resolution of the _ hubble space telescope ; ( hst ) _ have suggested that only at @xmath171.5 did the hubble sequence begin to emerge ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the spirals and ellipticals becoming as common as peculiar galaxies ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , galaxy morphologies reflect the complex ( non - linear ) processes of gas accretion , baryonic dissipation , star formation and morphological transformation that have occured during the history of the galaxy . furthermore , morphological studies of high - redshift galaxies are subject to k - corrections and structured dust obscuration , which complicates their interpretation .    the more fundamental physical properties of galaxies are their mass , energy and angular momentum , since these are related to the amount of material in a galaxy , the linear size and the rotational velocity .",
    "as originally suggested by @xcite , the hubble sequence of galaxy morphologies appears to follow a sequence of increasing angular momentum at a fixed mass ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one route to identifying the processes responsible for the formation of disks is therefore to measure the evolution of the mass , size and dynamics ( and hence angular momentum ) of galaxy disks with cosmic time  properties which are more closely related to the underlying dark matter halo .    in the cold dark matter paradigm , baryonic disks form at the centers of dark matter halos . as dark matter halos",
    "grow early in their formation history , they acquire angular momentum ( @xmath9 ) as a result of large scale tidal torques .",
    "the angular momentum acquired has strong mass dependence , with @xmath18 ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although the halos acquire angular momentum , the centrifugal support of the baryons and dark matter within the virial radius is small . indeed , whether calculated through linear theory or via @xmath19-body simulations , the `` spin '' ( which defines the ratio of the halo angular speed to that required for the halo to be entirely centrifugally supported ) follows approximately a log - normal distribution with average value @xmath20=0.035 @xcite .",
    "this quantity is invariant to cosmological parameters , time , mass or environment ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the gas collapses within the halo , the baryons can both lose and gain angular momentum between the virial radius and disk scale .",
    "if the baryons are dynamically cold , they fall inwards , weakly conserving specific angular momentum .",
    "although the spin of the baryon at the virial radius is small , by the time they reach @xmath21210kpc ( the `` size '' of a disk ) , they form a centrifugally supported disk which follows an exponential mass profile ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . here ,",
    "`` weakly conserved '' is within a factor of two , and indeed , observational studies suggest that late - type spiral disks have a spin of @xmath22=0.025 ; ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that that that only @xmath2130% of the initial baryonic angular momentum is lost due to viscous angular momentum redistribution and selective gas losses which occurs as the galaxy disks forms ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , if the baryons do not make it in to the disk , are redistributed ( e.g.  due to mergers ) , or blown out of the galaxy due to winds , then the spin of the disk is much lower than that of the halo .",
    "indeed , the fraction of the initial halo angular momentum that is lost must be as high as @xmath2190% for early - type and elliptical galaxies ( at the same stellar mass as spirals ; @xcite ) , with sa and s0 galaxies in between the extremes of late - type spiral- and elliptical- galaxies ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "numerical models have suggested that most of the angular momentum transfer occurs at epochs ealier than @xmath23 , after which the baryonic disks gain sufficient angular momentum to stabilise themselves @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite use identify four dominant phases of angular momentum exchange that dominate this process : linear tidal torques on the gas beyond and through the virial radius ; angular momentum transport through the halo ; and dissipation and disk instabilities , outflows in the disk itself .",
    "these processes can increase and decrease the specific angular momentum of the disk as it forms , although they eventually `` conspire '' to produce disks that have a similar spin distribution as the parent dark matter halo .",
    "measuring the processes that control the internal redistribution of angular momentum in high - redshift disks is observationally demanding .",
    "however , on galaxy scales ( i.e.  @xmath21210kpc ) , observations suggest redshift evolution according to @xmath8=j@xmath24/m@xmath25(1+@xmath0)@xmath26 with @xmath27@xmath281.5 , at least out to @xmath172 ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite exploited the kmos@xmath29 survey of @xmath1712.5 star - forming galaxies at to infer the angular momentum distribution of baryonic disks , finding that their spin is is broadly consistent the dark matter halos , with @xmath300.037 with a dispersion ( @xmath310.2 ) .",
    "the lack of correlation between the `` spin '' ( @xmath32/@xmath33 ) and the stellar densities of high - redshift galaxies also suggests that the redistribution of the angular momentum within the disks is the dominant process that leads to compactation ( i.e. bulge formation ; burkert et al .",

    ", these results suggest that angular momentum in high redshift disks plays a dominant role in `` crystalising '' the hubble sequence of galaxy morphologies .    in this paper",

    "we aim to measure the angular momentum of the stars and gas in large and representative samples of high - redshift galaxies . only now , with the capabilities of sensitive , multi - deployable ( or wide - area ) integral field spectrographs , such as muse and kmos , is this becoming possible ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",

    "we use our data to investigate how the mass , size , rotational velocity of galaxy disks evolves with cosmic time . as well as providing constraints on the processes which shape the hubble sequence , the evolution of the angular momentum and stellar mass provides a novel approach to test galaxy formation models since these values reflect the initial conditions of their host halos , merging , and the prescriptions that describe the processes of gas accretion , star formation and feedback , all of which can strongly effect the angular momentum of the baryonic disk .    in  [ sec :",
