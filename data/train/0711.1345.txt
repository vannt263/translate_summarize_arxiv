    "the feynarts package @xcite can paint feynman diagrams and export them as latex  code , such that they can be included directly in publications .",
    "for example , the diagram    ( 150,150)(1,1 ) ( 0.,10.)(6.,10.)(0.,)/straight0 ( 3.,9.18)[t]@xmath0 ( 20.,10.)(14.,10.)(0.,)/straight0 ( 17.,10.82)[b]@xmath1 ( 6.,10.)(14.,10.)(0.8,)/straight0 ( 10.,5.98)[t]@xmath2 ( 6.,10.)(14.,10.)(-0.8,)/straight0 ( 10.,14.02)[b]@xmath3 ( 6.,10.)0 ( 14.,10.)0    is represented by the latex  code    ....",

    "it is less straightforward , however , to alter the geometry of the diagram , i.e.  to move vertices and propagators .",
    "the new tool feynedit fills this gap by allowing the user to copy - and - paste their latex  code of the feynman diagram into the editor , visualize the diagram , modify it using the mouse , and finally copy - and - paste it back into the text .",
    "the feynedit package can be downloaded from @xmath4 . unpack the tar - file and run @xmath5 , for example :    `  gunzip  -c  feynedit-`@xmath6`.`@xmath7`.tar.gz  |  tar  xvf  - ` + `  cd  feynedit-`@xmath6`.`@xmath7",
    "+ `  make `    the package contains both the source files and the compiled java byte - code .",
    "the actual java program is @xmath8 and the above @xmath5 command only turns the jar - file into a regular executable by adding the script signature with the full path of the local system s java interpreter . on windows with a java runtime installed ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath8 executes directly when double - clicked .",
    "the editor is started by typing @xmath10 at the command line or by double - clicking on the @xmath8 icon on windows .",
    "the start - up screen is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : startup ] .    the start - up screen of feynedit . ]    the window is divided into an upper panel for the diagram display and a lower panel which shows the latex  code . to display an existing feynman diagram , mark its latex  code with the mouse and",
    "paste it into the lower dialog box .",
    "then press the button to display the diagram .",
    "otherwise , start with an empty canvas and use the mouse to add elements .",
    "when finished with editing , press the button to turn the diagrams into latex  code , then pick up the latter with the mouse and paste it ( back ) into your text .",
    "left panel : the diagram pasted into feynedit and displayed .",
    "right panel : the mouse button assignment menu in feynedit.,title=\"fig:\"]left panel : the diagram pasted into feynedit and displayed .",
    "right panel : the mouse button assignment menu in feynedit.,title=\"fig : \" ]    just as in the topology editor of feynarts , vertices are marked with red , propagators with blue , and labels with green squares .",
    "when clicking on a square , the corresponding entity becomes marked and the square is drawn a little larger .",
    "propagators come in two varieties which have to be distinguished for editing purposes : tadpoles , with coincident initial and final vertices , and ` ordinary ' propagators .",
    "the diagram can be edited with the mouse .",
    "four editing functions are available :    * move vertices , propagators , and labels : click on the corresponding box ( red , blue , green ) and drag it to the desired position . *",
    "draw tadpoles : click on the ` footpoint ' of the tadpole and drag it to the desired size and orientation . *",
    "draw ` ordinary ' propagators : click on the starting point and drag to the end point .",
    "* delete objects : click on the square ( red , blue , green ) corresponding to the object you want to delete",
    ". when deleting a vertex , the propagators adjacent to this vertex are also deleted . when deleting a propagator ,",
    "the corresponding label is also deleted .    in the default setup ,",
    "the left mouse button moves objects , the middle mouse button draws tadpoles , and the right mouse button draws propagators .",
    "the assignment of the mouse button can be changed in the mouse button assignment menu ( fig .  [",
    "fig : diagram ] , right panel ) .",
    "following is an overview of all buttons :    * interpret the latex  code and display the diagrams .",
    "* turn the edited diagrams into latex  code . *",
    "turn on grid snap , i.e.  restrict a dragged object s location to lie on a grid position ( ` quantize ' the drag movement ) .",
    "this is to aid the aligned placement of items .",
    "* turn off grid snap , i.e.  allow objects to be dragged to arbitrary positions .",
    "* move forward one diagram . for this button to become active , the latex  code must contain more than one diagram , separated by @xmath11 directives .",
    "* move back one diagram . *",
    "undo last change . *",
    "redo last undone change .",
    "* clear panel .",
    "* delete the currently marked entity .",
    "* copy the contents of the latex  panel into the copy - and - paste buffer . * paste the current copy - and - paste buffer into the latex  panel .",
    "note that details of the diagram , such as line attributes and label texts , are neither displayed by the editor , nor can they be specified for new tadpoles and propagators .",
    "thus , for example , a gluon line is not drawn as a cycloid .",
    "this is largely for performance reasons ( think of dragging a gluon line ) and may be added in a future version . at any rate , it is not a serious deficit because that information can easily be added in the latex  code .",
    "for instance , the line    ....     \\faprop(0.,10.)(6.,10.)(0.,){/straight}{0 } ....    refers to a straight line .",
    "simply changing `` @xmath12 '' to `` @xmath13 '' makes it a gluon line .",
    "the next section gives all such details on the feynarts latex  style .",
    "the feynarts style is included in a latex  @xmath14 document with    ....    \\usepackage{feynarts } ....    it makes three graphics primitives available with which feynman diagrams can be drawn :    * @xmath15 draws a propagator , * @xmath16 draws a vertex , * @xmath17 places a label .",
    "in addition , it provides formatting / geometry directives :    * @xmath18@xmath19@xmath20 delineates a sheet of feynman diagrams , * @xmath11 advances to the next diagram .",
    "since @xmath21 emits direct postscript primitives , the interpretation of which is non - standard across postscript renderers , it is guaranteed to work only with @xmath22 .      a single feynman diagram is always drawn on a @xmath23 canvas .",
    "several such canvasses are combined into a rectangular sheet which can optionally carry a title .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] for illustration .",
    "such a sheet of feynman diagrams is enclosed in a @xmath24 environment in latex :    `  begin(`@xmath25`,`@xmath26`)(`@xmath27`,`@xmath28 ` ) ` + `  ... ` + `  end `    this sheet has a size of @xmath29 ( in units of latex s @xmath30 ) with room for @xmath31 feynman diagrams . @xmath32",
    "need not be an integer and the extra space implied by the fractional part is allocated at the top for the sheet label .",
    "note that it is not possible to distort the aspect ratio of a feynman diagram .",
    "if the ratio @xmath33 is chosen different from the ratio @xmath34 , the sheet will fit the smaller dimension exactly and be centered in the larger dimension .    inside the @xmath24 , the macro    `  fadiagram`@xmath35    advances to the next diagram , which has the title @xmath36 .",
    "the size of @xmath36 can be changed by redefining @xmath37 with one of the usual latex  font - size specifiers , e.g.     ....",
