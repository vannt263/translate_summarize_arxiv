    "these anomalies made pzt material useful for many technical application [ 1 ] . in",
    "particular compositions of pzt enriched by zr ( @xmath11 ) appeared to be useful for application in the novel branches of electronic technique ( see e.g. [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] and ref . therein ) .",
    "theoretical description of the properties and phase diagram nearby antiferroelectric phase transition is hard problem because of complexity of description of antiferroelectric phase itself .",
    "the proximity of free energies of antiferroelectric and ferroelectric state is known to be the characteristic feature of antiferroelectrics [ 4 ] .",
    "this proximity lead to dielectric permittivity anomalies and to the possibility to induce ferroelectric order by application of small enough electric field .",
    "the latter can be the clue of the reasons of ferroelectric phase appearance even at small @xmath12 values .",
    "small content of ferroelectric material in the mixed system can be considered as the source of electric dipoles and induced by them random electric field .",
    "calculation of this field magnitude allowing for dipole - dipole interaction via ferroelectric and nonferroelectric soft modes had shown that mean field is induced by the interaction via ferroelectric soft mode whereas other soft modes increase mean square field [ 5 ] .",
    "the supposition that nonzero internal mean field can destroy antiferroelectric order by the same way as external field made it possible to describe semiquantitively the observed phase diagram [ 5 ] .    in present work we performed detailed calculations of phase diagram of mixed antiferroelectric - ferroelectric system for the region of small concentration of ferroelectric material .",
    "the obtained data fitted pretty good measured phase diagram for pzt and radp .",
    "the application of proposed method for calculation of phase diagrams in different mixed ferroelectrics is discussed .",
    "let us begin with the description of antiferroelectric phase . in ising model",

    "note , that in this model mean dipole moment of the unit cell has the form :    @xmath30    thus we consider the simplest two - sublattice model of antiferroelectric .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) leads to the following expressions for the order parameters :    @xmath31    eqs .",
    "( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) describe antiferroelectric component , i.e. mixed system at @xmath32 .",
    "ferroelectric component corresponds to @xmath33 and its order parameter @xmath34 in ising model has the form [ 4 ]    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is mean field , that defined ferroelectric transition temperature , @xmath37 is effective dipole moment of ferroelectric component ions .",
    "addition of small amount of ferroelectric component to antiferroelectric one leads to appearance of random electric field @xmath38 , induced by electric dipoles of this component in the mixed system .",
    "mean field in the mixed system has to include the contribution from ferroelectric component and from ferroelectric order parameter of antiferroelectric component namely    @xmath39    this field as the most probable one has to define the position of maximum of random field distribution function @xmath40 .",
    "it is equal to @xmath41 in mean field approximation .",
    "beyond of this approximation one has to take into account random field , i.e. to substitute @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) or @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) for @xmath21 in eqs .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , ( [ e4 ] ) and to perform averaging with random field distribution function .",
    "this yields :    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    one can see that in mean field approximation when @xmath40 has the form of @xmath49-function eqs .",

    "let us proceed now to calculations of the transition temperatures @xmath7 ( to antiferroelectric phase ) and @xmath8 ( to ferroelectric phase ) dependence on concentration . for the phase transitions of the second order",

    "one can see , that the transition temperatures are defined by the corresponding transition temperatures and concentrations of the components of mixed system and random field distribution function characteristics .",
    "equations ( 10 ) define concentrational dependence of transition temperature , i.e. phase diagram of mixed system for small concentration of ferroelectric component .",

    "let us limit ourselves by the case @xmath86 which is of  importance both for case of  pzt and radp on the  edges  of phase diagram . to perform the calculations on the base of eqs .",
    "( [ e10c ] ) we have to know concentrational dependence of  integrals @xmath87 defined by the distribution function @xmath88 . for electric dipoles as random field sources",
    "it can be represented in gaussian form ( see [ 6 ] for details ) :    @xmath89    @xmath90    here @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are respectively dielectric permittivity , lattice constant and correlation radius connected with soft ferroelectric mode of antiferroelectric component of mixed system .",

    ", we obtain that this reduces just to renormalization of parameter @xmath97 in ( [ e12 ] ) , giving @xmath98 .",
    "to map correctly the interval @xmath99 into interval @xmath100 we adopt following parametrization for @xmath101@xmath102 let us begin with critical concentration for antiferroelectric phase transition .    at @xmath103 eqs.([e10a ] ) with respect to eqs .",

    "( [ e14 ] ) has been solved numerically during the calculation of @xmath109    critical concentration for ferroelectric phase transition can be obtained by the same way , but in the limit of @xmath110 , i.e. at @xmath111 , this ratio being larger or close to unity .",

    "phase diagram .",
    "i.e. concentrational dependence of antiferroelectric and ferroelectric phase transition temeprature was calculated with help of eqs.(10 ) .",
    "integrals @xmath115 were calculated numerically .",
    "the obtained phase diagram is represented in fig.1 in the region of small concentration of ferroelectric component for several values of dimensionless parameters @xmath116 @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( see eq.([e10b ] ) ) .",
    "one can see from fig.1 that antiferroelectric phase transition critical concentration @xmath82 increases with @xmath119 decrease , its values being close to those calculated on the base of eq.([e14 ] ) .",
    "the obtained critical concentration of ferroelectric phase transition several times smaller than that for antiferroelectric transition .",
    "this seems to be the result of proximity of free energies and may be of @xmath120 and @xmath121 which is characteristic feature of antiferroelectrics .",
    "the dimensionless transition temperature to antiferroelectric phase @xmath107 decreases with concentration increase for all the considered parameters , whereas the behaviour of that to ferroelectric phase @xmath122 depends on the choise of the parameters values .",
    "in particular @xmath122 can increase or decrease with increase of electric dipoles concentration ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "physically these types of behaviour depend on distribution function width and ratio ( @xmath118 ) of ferroelectric phase transition temepratures @xmath123 of ferroelectric component of mixed system to that of antiferroelectric component @xmath120 : the smaller the distribution function width and the larger @xmath118 value , the larger ferroelectric phase transition temperature in the mixed system .",
    "let us begin with comparison of obtained data with experiment .",
    "the prominent example of mixed ferro - antiferro system is known to be pbzr@xmath0ti@xmath124o@xmath125 ( @xmath10 ) , where pbzro@xmath125 is antiferroelectric with transition temeprature from cubic paraelectric phase to rhombic antiferroelectric phase at @xmath126 k and pbtio@xmath125 is ferroelectric with transition temeprature from cubic paraelectric phase to tetragonal ferroelectric phase at @xmath127 k. phase diagram of mixed pzt system was investigated in many papers , but mainly at @xmath128 ( see e.g. [ 6 ] and ref . therein ) .",
    "therefore critical concentration @xmath82 is known , and @xmath129 k at @xmath130 .",
    "one can see that the curve for @xmath131 gives @xmath132 k at @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "general form of calculated @xmath135 concentrational dependence looks like experimental curve at @xmath136 ( fig.1 ) . there is a scattering of experimental data for ferroelectric phase transition temperature at small pbtio@xmath125 content ( @xmath137 ) because of influence of some uncontrolled defects and impurities on @xmath138 value .",
    "the most probable behaviour of @xmath139 is its slight increase ( fig.1 ) [ 6 ] .",
    "such behaviour is similar to the calculated curve with @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "another important example of mixed ferro - antiferro system is rb@xmath0(nh@xmath142)@xmath124h@xmath143po@xmath144 ( @xmath10 ) as a representative of hydrogen - bonded material .",
    "it was studied in many details ( see e.g. [ 7 ] ) .",
    "rbh@xmath145po@xmath144 ( rdp ) undergoes a ferroelectric phase transition at @xmath146 k , nh@xmath144h@xmath143po@xmath144 ( adp ) becomes antiferroelectric near @xmath147 k. in mixed radp system antiferroelectric transition temperature @xmath148 decreases with increase of rdp content and @xmath76 k near @xmath149 of rdp admixture , i.e. @xmath150 [ 8 ] .",
    "substitution of this @xmath82 value into eq.([e14 ] ) gives @xmath151 .",
    "one can see from fig.2 that the curve , which corresponds to @xmath152 fits the experimental points .",
    "contrary to pzt there is no data about existence of ferroelectric phase transition at small ( @xmath153 ) content of rdp .",
    "the reason for this difference can be the approximately equal values of @xmath123 and @xmath154 in radp whereas they are different in pzt . because of this theoretical parameter @xmath155 in radp and at @xmath156 @xmath157 curve may be lower than @xmath158 curve and only antiferroelectric phase transition exists .",
    "one can see from fig.2 , that proposed theory explaines the observed behaviour of ferroelectric phase transition decrease with increase of antiferroelectric component concentration and observed critical concentration @xmath79 ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "note that tuneling has to be taken into account for mixed systems of kdp family .",
    "preliminary calculations have shown , that tuneling result into change of fitting parameters values .",
    "therefore the proposed theory describes pretty good phase diagrams of pzt and radp for small @xmath12 values .",
    "note , that only for small @xmath12 ( @xmath160 ) ti and rb ions can be considered as impurities randomly distributed in pbzro@xmath161 and nh@xmath144h@xmath143po@xmath144 matrices so that they can be the sources of random field .",
    "4.2 . the proposed theory can be applied for another types of mixed systems .",
    "for example , mixture of two ferroelectric systems @xmath162 at @xmath11 described with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) , ( [ e8 ] ) at zero antiferroelectric phase order parameter ( @xmath51 ) . in this case",
    "the equations for @xmath22 and @xmath34 completely the same , i.e. @xmath163 .",
    "in such situation mean field @xmath164 is ferroelectric phase transition temperature of @xmath165 component whereas @xmath166 component defines the form and width of random field distribution function . because the main physical idea of the proposed model is the inhibition and distruction of long range ferroelectric or antiferroelectric order by random electric field of different sources this model can be useful for description to relaxor ferroelectrics like pbmg@xmath167nb@xmath168o@xmath125 ( pmn ) , pbsc@xmath169ta@xmath170o@xmath125 ( pst ) , pb@xmath171la@xmath172zr@xmath173ti@xmath174o@xmath125 ( plzt , @xmath175 ; 0,09 ) .",
    "but the relaxors like pmn , pst are not solid solutions of two component , and in plzt la ions are the impurities .",
    "thus in all these materials there is onlu one ferroelectric component known as burns reference phase ( see [ 9 ] and ref . therein ) , which is pbzr@xmath173ti@xmath174o@xmath125 in the of plzt . the transition temperature from para- to ferroelectric phase of",
    "the reference phase @xmath176 defines the position of random field distribution maxima whereas the substitutional disorder , vacancies of lead and oxygen , impurities like la in plzt define the distribution function width .",
    "namely such a model has been proposed recently [ 10 ] .",
    "it permitted to describe the observed phase diagram of the relaxors , their dynamic and static properties peculiarities ( see e.g. [ 11 ] and ref .",
    "therein ) .",
    "since the model is able to describe the distraction of long range order by any random field sources it can be useful also for description of solid solutions of ferroelectric and dielectric components , e.g. ba(ti@xmath0sn@xmath177)o@xmath125 ( @xmath11 ) . the observed in this material relaxor - like behaviour as well as change of phase transition order [ 12 ] can be the consequence of strong random field influence as it was shown recently [ 11,13 ] .",
    "note that some residual ferroelectric domains were observed in another relaxor plzt ( 9/65/35 ) [ 14 ] .",
    "as the matter of fact , the dipole glass and mixed ferroglass phases ( which appear in the relaxors with temperature lowering ) can be considered as the reentrant phases with respect to this residual ferroelectric phase existing near the burns temperature .",
    "therefore the generality of proposed model gives a possibility to apply it to various mixed systems which are solid solutions of ferro- and antiferroelectrics , two ferroelectrics , ferroelectric and dielectric etc .",
    "as well as to ferroelectric relaxors ."
