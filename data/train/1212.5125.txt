    "classical elasticity theory rests on the hypothesis that a solid may exist in a stress - free state in euclidean space .",
    "the dynamics of the solid is then described by a time - dependent mapping taking the position of each material particle in this relaxed reference state to its actual position at a given time .",
    "now the hypothesis of the existence of a relaxed state is violated when dislocations are present in the solid .",
    "these cause internal stresses even in the absence of external forces .",
    "solids in which a continuous distribution of dislocations is present have been treated in the linear approximation ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . however , the conceptual framework of this linear theory is inadequate for the formulation of an exact theory .",
    "the appropriate conceptual framework was introduced in @xcite and an exact nonlinear theory was proposed .",
    "the basic concept introduced in @xcite is that of the material manifold which captures those properties of a crystalline solid which are intrinsic to it , being independent of the way it is embedded in space .",
    "the dynamics of the elastic body is then described by a mapping from space - time into this material manifold .",
    "while an exact theory of crystalline solids with a continuous distribution of dislocations was formulated in @xcite , the theory was left undeveloped up to the present time .",
    "the aim of the present work is to develop the theory and derive results which may be brought into contact with experimental data .",
    "our focus in the present paper is on the static case , where we have a crystalline solid with a uniform distribution of elementary dislocations in equilibrium in free space . as a basic example we study , in the continuum limit , a two - dimensional crystalline solid with a uniform distribution of edge dislocations , one of the two elementary types of dislocations . in this case",
    "the material manifold is the affine group of the real line , the hyperbolic plane .",
    "we then study , in the continuum limit , a three - dimensional crystalline solid with a uniform distribution of screw dislocations , the other elementary type of dislocation . in this case",
    "the material manifold is the heisenberg group .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to introduce to the mathematics and theoretical physics community a field where beautiful differential geometric structures , in particular lie groups , form the basis of a classical physical theory .",
    "moreover , the laws of the theory form a nonlinear system of variational partial differential equations , which in the static case is elliptic and in the dynamical case is of hyperbolic type .",
    "both cases constitute a worthy challenge for the geometric analyst .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in part",
    "i , we give a general introduction to the theory of crystalline solids containing an arbitrary distribution of dislocations , based on the work of christodoulou @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we introduce the basic concepts of material manifold and crystalline structure . in the present work , the fundamental notion is the canonical form , which is used to define the dislocation density .",
    "we illustrate the theory by giving two basic examples of solids with a uniform distribution of dislocations . in order to state the laws governing the dynamics ,",
    "the thermodynamic space is introduced and the energy function defined .",
    "the dynamics is described by a mapping from space - time into the material manifold .",
    "the equivalence relations for crystalline structures and for the mechanical properties of a solid are discussed to give the proper physical interpretation of the theory . finally , the eulerian picture is given including the non - relativistic limit . in the eulerian picture",
    "the material manifold is eliminated .    in part ii , we focus our attention on the static case .",
    "we derive the boundary value problem from an action principle and give the legendre - hadamard conditions for the energy function .",
    "we then consider the two examples of uniform distributions of elementary dislocations and motivate the choice of our model energy function .",
    "we separately discuss the special cases of uniform distributions of edge and screw dislocations in two and three dimensions , respectively . in concluding the second part",
    ", we derive the scaling properties of the theory .",
    "part iii is devoted to the analysis of equilibrium configurations of a crystalline solid with a uniform distribution of elementary dislocations in two and three dimensions .",
    "we solve the problem in two dimensions and give the method for the solution of the anisotropic problem in the case of a uniform distribution of screw dislocations in three dimensions .",
