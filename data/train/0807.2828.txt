    "most of the known exoplanets are giant planets on short period orbits around their stars . in the core - accretion model ,",
    "such planets should have formed much further away , beyond the so - called `` snow - line '' , where water is solid and contributes to the formation of a massive solid core .",
    "this suggests that inward planetary migration occured in the protoplanetary disc . through mutual gravitationnal interactions , a planet and the gaseous disc exchange energy and angular momentum . for a giant planet ,",
    "this lead to the opening of a gap and to the migration of the planet ( @xcite ) .",
    "a stronger evidence for migration is that a large fraction of multiplanet systems are engaged a mean motion resonance ( mmr ) : the ratio of the orbital periods of the outer to the inner planet , equals that of two small integers .",
    "this can not happen by chance .",
    "it betrays a convergent migration of the planets and a dissipative process to enter this dynamical configuration .",
    "for instance , in gj  876 , the two most massive planets are in a 2:1 mmr , with periods of @xmath0 and @xmath1 days .",
    "to model the formation of this system , @xcite performed 3-body simulations of a central host star and two planets , with additional ( dissipative ) forces that reproduced the effects of disc - planet interaction . only the outer planet was forced to migrate inward ( assuming that the inner planet has no ambient gas ) .",
    "capture into resonance occured when the outer planet crosses the location at which the mean orbital periods have a ratio of 2 .",
    "after the resonant capture , however , the eccentricities of the two planets rise dramatically ( except if an irrealistically high eccentricity damping is applied to the outer planet ) .",
    "a planet of mass @xmath2 , semi - major - axis @xmath3 , and eccentricity @xmath4 has an energy @xmath5 and an angular momentum @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denote the sum of the masses of the central star and the planet . denoting by @xmath8 and @xmath9 ,",
    "one finds : @xmath10    if two planets are in resonance , the ratio between their energies is constant .",
    "we define : @xmath11 .",
    "the variation of the energy of the entire system ( the pair of planets ) , @xmath12 , is the sum of the energy variations applied to both planets , such that @xmath13 .",
    "the same holds for the angular momentum .",
    "if the planets are in mmr and their eccentricities are constant , the ratio between their angular momenta is also constant : @xmath14 .    with some algebra ,",
    "one finds a relation between @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 for the planets to evolve in resonance with given eccentricities .",
    "it reads : @xmath19 the damping rate that should be applied to the inner planet ( @xmath20 ) is the sum of two terms . the first one ( @xmath21 ) is required to balance the action on the outer planet ; it is not zero in general .",
    "this explains why the eccentricities rised too much in lee & peale s simulations .",
    "the second term ( @xmath22 ) is proportional to @xmath23 , with @xmath24 : if the inner planet is pushed outwards by an inner disk ( @xmath25 ) , an additionnal damping is required .",
    "we computed a few hydro - simulations of a giant planet , on a fixed orbit with various eccentricities .",
    "a gaseous disc is present inside the planetary orbit .",
    "we measure the otrque and power of the force of the disc on the planet .",
    "we find that for @xmath26 , the disc damps the eccentricity of the planet .",
    "for @xmath27 , the expected migration if one releases the planet is directed outwards .",
    "thus , the inner disc can play a crucial role on the orbital evolution of a pair of planets in resonance .",
    "note that the evolution of the inner disc depends crucially on the radius of its inner edge @xmath28 , with respect to @xmath3 , the semi - major - axis of the orbit of the gap - opening planet @xcite .",
    "if @xmath29 is not small with respect to @xmath30 , the inner disc should disappear promptly . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath31 , it should not disappear at all .",
    ".parameters of the system gj  876 as given by @xcite for gj  876b and gj  876c , and by ` http://exoplanets.eu/ ` for gj  876d . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : gj876 ]    the two planets gj  876b and gj  876c are in 2:1 mmr ( see table  [ tab : gj876 ] ) . a third , smaller planet orbits very close to the star .",
    "this planet is not massive enough to open a gap in the gas disc ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus it was in type  i migration , and most likely migrated all the way inwards , until it falls in the empty cavity between the star and @xmath32 .",
    "more precisely until the outermost resonance with the planet ( the 2:1 ) lies in the cavity : the disc and the planet exchange angular momentum through the resonances .",

    "the horizontal lines correspond to the observed values , as given by table  [ tab : gj876 ] . ]",

    "we compute a simulation of the two most massive planets of gj  876 in a disc with a viscosity given by an @xmath39-prescription with @xmath40 and an aspect ratio of @xmath41 .",
    "first , the planets are on fixed circular orbits , and shape a gap in the disc . then , they are released and they migrate freely .",
    "the results are shown on figure  [ fig : gj876_hydro ] .",
    "a resonant capture in the 2:1 mmr happens at @xmath42 ; then , the eccentricites increase , but the presence of the inner disc prevents @xmath4 reaching too high values . in the end of the simulation , the semi - major - axes and eccentricities have almost exactly the observed values .",
