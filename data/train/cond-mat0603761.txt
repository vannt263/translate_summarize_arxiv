    "the foundation of many physical theories is the observation that a certain physical quantity is `` small '' . in practice",
    ", this means that the ratio between two different quantities with the same units is much less than unity .",
    "once a small quantity has been identified , there are two ways of proceeding .",
    "first of all , that quantity can be set to zero , if one wishes to emphasize other aspects of the system .",
    "this is what is done when presenting the harmonic oscillator to students for the first time : one usually sets the dissipation to zero , even though its effects are quite important .",
    "the second possibility is to use the small quantity to linearize the equations .",
    "this is what one does when one suspects that the quantity , though small , plays an important role .",
    "an example is linear stability analysis .    in the study of granular materials ,",
    "an obvious choice for a small quantity is the distance particles must move in order to activate contact forces .",
    "this choice is motivated by the common observation that in a pile of stones or marbles , the deformation of the particles due to the stresses put on them is not visible to the naked eye .",
    "should these deformations be set to zero , or kept as a small parameter ?    at the end of the last century , this question was quite controversial , as one can see from browsing through a conference proceeding from that time @xcite .",
    "the issue at hand was the stress distribution at the bottom of a sand pile .",
    "several authors @xcite proposed theories where the grains were assumed to be perfectly rigid . in this way",
    ", they could circumvent the question of a stress - free reference state .",
    "however , these theories were criticized on many points @xcite .",
    "for example , it was pointed out that continuum mechanics could also account for the observations @xcite .",
    "another objection was that they used arbitrary ways to resolve the problem of contact force indeterminacy .",
    "this problem arises because it is impossible to deduce the contact forces in a static granular packing from assuming force equilibrium .",
    "there is no unique solution ; instead many solutions are possible @xcite .",
    "this loss of uniqueness occurs because there are more unknowns ( contact forces ) than equations ( vanishing force and torque on each particle ) .",
    "but the root of all these objections was the realization that rigid particle theories must be radically different from continuum mechanics . in continuum",
    "mechanics , the counterpart to the particle deformations is the strain . thus neglecting deformations corresponds to eliminating the strain .",
    "but strain is a fundamental quantity , and eliminating it destroys the entire structure of continuum mechanics .",
    "continuum mechanics can describe the macroscopic behavior of granular materials , and it would be quite strange if the best microscopic or grain - level theory were incompatible with it .",
    "it was no coincidence that most opposition to rigid particle theories came from engineers , who are more familiar with continuum mechanics than most physicists .",
    "the recently proposed force network ensemble @xcite can be considered as a modern version of the rigid particle theories . instead of adding assumptions to determine the forces , all possibilities are considered .",
    "the system is thus represented by a point in a high - dimensional space @xcite , much like in statistical mechanics .",
    "one should also mention the widely used numerical method of contact dynamics @xcite , which is also based on the assumption of rigid particles .",
    "this paper is concerned with an alternative approach , where the particle deformations are a small parameter of central importance .",
    "we call this approach `` quasi - rigidity ''",
    ". this choice is motivated both by the belief that such deformations determine the contact forces in physical systems , and by the desire to propose a theory compatible with continuum mechanics , in view of arranging a future marriage between microscopic and macroscopic theories .",
    "quasi - rigidity was first proposed as the basis for a numerical method @xcite , but has recently been explored theoretically by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "results of this approach include a deeper understanding of isostatic packings of frictionless particles @xcite , the microscopic origins of strain @xcite , the stability of packings @xcite , the relation between softening and sliding contacts @xcite , and jamming @xcite .",
    "work on a corresponding numerical method @xcite has also continued .    in quasi - rigid theories ,",
    "the state of the packing is given by the deformation of the particles at each contact .",
    "these deformations determine the contact forces , which in turn govern the motion of the particles .",
    "finally , the particle motion gives the change of the deformations .",
    "when studying the response of a packing to an external load , these deformations must be given initial values , analogous to specifying a reference state in continuum mechanics .",
    "do these theories predict a unique evolution of the packing ? two possible sources of non - uniqueness have been pointed out @xcite .",
    "first of all , indeterminacy can occur if there exists a possible motion that would not modify the contact forces .",
    "such motions are called `` floppy modes '' or `` mechanisms '' .",
    "we call this mechanism indeterminacy .",
    "secondly , indeterminacy can arise due to the necessity to choose the status ( sliding or non - sliding ) of each contact .",
    "this is contact status indeterminacy .    in this paper , we show that both types of indeterminacy do not occur . mechanism instability appears to be a problem because force equilibrium is the usual starting point for quasi - rigid theories . but",
    "force equilibrium can be considered as a certain limit of newton s second law .",
    "when this is done , one can assess the impact of any mechanisms that may be present .",
    "contact status indeterminacy can be eliminated by requiring that the contacts obey coulomb friction , and letting contacts slide only when necessary .",
    "this is what is commonly done in numerical simulations .",
    "a precise definition of ` necessary ' will be given later in this paper .",
    "a third possible source of indeterminacy is opening or closing contacts .",
    "in this situation , one must consider transitions between four different statuses(open , non - sliding , and two different sliding directions ) .",
    "one would like to be sure that such transitions are always uniquely determined .",
    "unfortunately , the methods developed in this paper are not sufficient to show this , so that this possible source of indeterminacy must be investigated in the future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ synopsis ] presents an overview of the paper , detailing the questions posed in the introduction , and sketching the results of the rest of the paper .",
    "readers not wishing to savor the details may read this section , and then skip directly to sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] for a discussion of the results .",
    "the stiffness matrix for frictional disks is derived in sec .",

    "[ statusindet ] deals with contact status indeterminacy by showing that there is a unique way to choose contact statuses .",
    "and @xmath0 are applied to the vertical and horizontal walls . ]    in this paper , we will deal with an assembly of disks , interacting via coulomb friction and subjected to a slowly changing force . as a concrete example , consider a biaxial box , where a granular sample composed of disks is enclosed in a rectangular box of dimensions @xmath1 , with forces @xmath2 and @xmath0 exerted on the walls .",
    "these forces vary slowly with time , and one measures the resulting movement of the walls . a sketch of the biaxial box is shown in fig .",
    "[ biaxial ] .    in sec .",
    "[ qqd ] , we define the quasi - rigid limit precisely , and show that it leads to a piece - wise linear behavior of the packing . thus time can be divided into intervals @xmath3 $ ] during which the velocities of the particles are linearly related to the change in forces : @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the external forces ( @xmath2 and @xmath0 for the biaxial box ) , @xmath6 contains the velocities of the particles , and @xmath7 is called the _",
    "stiffness matrix_.    the motion is only _ piece - wise _ linear because the stiffness matrix @xmath7 depends on the contact status . whenever a contact status changes , therefore , @xmath7 must be modified",
    "therefore , the times @xmath8 which define the intervals of linearity are the times when one or more contacts change status .      what happens when the stiffness matrix has a zero eigenvalue ?",
    "in that case , there exists @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "any multiple of @xmath11 can be added to the solution of eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) , and it would still be a solution . thus it would seem that the theory is incapable of determining the amplitude of @xmath11 .",
    "but it important to realize that one obtains eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) under the assumption that the external forces change on a time scale that is very long compared to the vibrations in the granular packing .",
    "the appearance of a zero eigenvalue corresponds to a diverging time scale of vibration , and thus the assumptions leading to eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) are not met .",
    "one must use instead newton s second law , and in this case , the amplitude of @xmath11 can be determined . if there is no interaction between the mechanism and the external force ( @xmath12 ) , then the mechanism is decoupled from the other degrees of freedom , and eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) can still be used .",
    "another source of indeterminacy may arise from the dependence of @xmath7 on the contact status .",
    "each contact in the packing may be sliding or non - sliding , and each choice leads to a different stiffness matrix . if there are @xmath13 contacts , there are @xmath14 ways to assign contact status , and thus @xmath14 possible stiffness matrices , and @xmath14 different solutions to eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) .",
    "which one is correct ? as stated in the introduction , there is a unique solution if the contacts have coulomb friction , and slide only when necessary .",
    "coulomb friction means that the condition @xmath15 must be obeyed at each contact . here",
    ", @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the normal and tangential components of the contact force .",
    "the constant @xmath18 is the coulomb friction coefficient .",
    "when we say that contacts should slide only when necessary , we mean that they should slide only when they would violate eq .",

[ block ] .",
    "a force tangential to the plane @xmath20 is also applied .",
    "the contact between the block and the plane exerts a normal force @xmath21 and a tangential force @xmath22 .",
    "let these forces be directed opposite to the external ones , so @xmath23 indicates force equilibrium .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath19 is fixed , while @xmath20 is slowly increased from zero .",
    "as long as @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 and @xmath26 , so the block remains in place , and the contact is non - sliding . when @xmath27 , the block must begin to slide , since the contact can not cancel the imposed tangential force without violating eq .",
    "( [ coulombcondition ] ) .",
    "the contact is now sliding and @xmath28 .",
    "now suppose @xmath20 is decreased again , so that @xmath24 .",
    "the block will de - accelerate , and finally stop .",
    "when the block stops , the principle of minimum sliding says that the contact must become non - sliding .",
    "then the block will remain in place as long as @xmath29 . note that if we did not apply the principle of minimum sliding , we would obtain a nonsensical result : the tangential contact force would remain constant at @xmath30 and start to accelerate the block .",
    "the frictional forces would thus be doing work on the block , which is a violation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "thus , there is nothing artificial about the principle of minimum sliding .",
    "it is simply makes explicit what is needed to obtain sensible results .",
    "it also describes what is done in numerical simulations .",
    "now let us return to the problem of choosing the contact statuses in a granular packing .",
    "it is helpful to consider the contact forces as points in the ( @xmath31 plane .",
    "the set of forces @xmath32 that obey eq .",
    "( [ coulombcondition ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ cone ] as a shaded region .",
    "this set is called the _ coulomb cone _ because it forms a cone when plotted this way .     plane .",
    "the coulomb cone is shaded .",
    "the contact begins at point @xmath33 within the cone . at @xmath34 , it reaches the surface of the cone , becomes sliding , and moves along the cone boundary . at @xmath35",
    "it becomes non - sliding and moves into the cone interior . ]",
    "as the particles move , the contact forces change , and thus trace out continuous trajectories in the @xmath32 plane .",
    "these trajectories must of course remain within the coulomb cone . for contacts in the interior of the coulomb cone ,",
    "any motion is allowed ( for short enough times ) , since there is no danger they will leave the cone . therefore , all such contacts will be non - sliding by the principle of minimum sliding .",
    "contacts whose forces lie on the boundary of the coulomb cone @xmath36 are called _ critical _ contacts , and must be handled carefully , since they may leave the coulomb cone .",
    "if they are sliding , they will stay on the boundary .",
    "but as we saw above , we must also allow them to leave this surface and enter back into the interior of the coulomb cone .",
    "therefore , each critical contact could be sliding or non - sliding .",
    "it seems that one could determine the status of the critical contacts simply by inspecting the particle velocities @xmath6 .",
    "these velocities determine the change in contact forces , and one can easily determine if these changes would cause a critical contact to return to the interior of the coulomb cone or not .",
    "however , changing a contact status also changes the matrix @xmath7 and thus through eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) the velocities @xmath6 .",
    "these new velocities may require changing the status of other contacts , provoking another re - calculation of @xmath6 , etc .",
    "thus it seems one must use an iterative procedure .",
    "one assigns the contact status in a certain way , uses eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) to calculate the particle velocities @xmath6 , and then begins to check if these velocities are consistent with the chosen statuses .",
    "if an inconsistency is found , the status must be changed , and the procedure begins again .",
    "this procedure must be continued until a solution is found .    in this paper , we are not concerned with this algorithm , but rather about the uniqueness and existence of a solution .",
    "is it always possible to find a solution ? or are there many solutions ?",
    "note that it is difficult to investigate these questions numerically .",
    "even though we must only deal with the critical contacts , we are often faced with situations where all possibilities can not be investigated .",
    "for example , it is common to have hundreds of critical contacts in numerical simulations involving thousands of particles .",
    "this means that the possible ways to choose the status can not even be numbered with 64-bit integers .",
    "either the non - existence or non - uniqueness would bring up hard questions about the quasi - rigid approach .",
    "if there were sometimes no solutions , the theory could not be applied to those situations .",
    "on the other hand , if the solution were not unique , the stiffness matrix , combined with the principle of minimum sliding , would not be a complete description of the system .",
    "some physical process must decide between the different possibilities .",
    "this unknown process would have been left out of the model , leading to indeterminacy in the same way that neglecting particle deformations leads to force indeterminacy .",
    "we would then have to ask what that physical process could be .",
    "one possibility is sound waves .",
    "as we show below , the quasi - static assumption amounts to removing ` fast ' processes like sound waves . when a contact changes status , there is probably a `` negotiation '' between the critical contacts , mediated by sound waves , that establishes their status . in the quasi - static limit , this period of negotiation becomes a single point in time , and it is assumed that the principle of minimum sliding suffices to determine the new status .",
    "non - uniqueness of the choice of contact status means that the details of this negotiation must be taken into account .",
    "we now sketch the proof that that there is always one , and only one choice of contact status that satisfies the principle of minimum sliding everywhere in the packing .",
    "we begin by defining some terms .",
    "let the _ state _ of a packing be a way of assigning the status to all the critical contacts . to each state",
    "belongs a corresponding set of velocities @xmath6 , which can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) .",
    "a state is _ locally consistent at contact @xmath37 _ if the principle of minimum sliding is obeyed at that contact , and _ locally inconsistent _ otherwise .",
    "we also refer to the _ consistency _ of a contact , which means whether or not the principle of minimum sliding is obeyed there or not .",
    "a state is _ globally consistent _ if it is locally consistent at all contacts .",
    "we are thus concerned with the existence and uniqueness of the globally consistent state .",
    "the proof has two premises .",
    "first , we assume that all possible states lead to a stable packing .",
    "the packing is stable if @xmath38 for a certain ( large ) class of relevant vectors @xmath6 .",
    "the second premise is the observation that the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) is not modified by the status of the contacts .",
    "thus if we consider two different states @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the global contact status , one has @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the stiffness matrix obtained if one chooses @xmath39 , and @xmath43 is obtained by choosing @xmath40 .",
    "the corresponding velocities are @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ previewstability ] ) and ( [ previewsamesol ] ) it is possible to derive a series of inequalities , from which one may deduce the following theorem :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ status change theorem : _ if the status of any set of critical contacts changes , the consistency of at least one of those contacts must also change . _",

    "a particular state corresponds to a @xmath46-bit binary number , @xmath47 , with each bit corresponding to the status of a single critical contact , and @xmath46 is the number of critical contacts . for concreteness ,",
    "let us say @xmath48 if contact @xmath37 is sliding , and @xmath49 if it is non - sliding . to check the consistency of a given state @xmath50 of contact status",
    ", we would construct the corresponding stiffness matrix @xmath51 , solve eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) for @xmath52 , and then check for consistency at each critical contact .",
    "the result of this procedure can be represented by a second @xmath46-bit binary number @xmath53 , where each bit gives the consistency of a critical contact , i.e. @xmath54 if contact @xmath37 is consistent , and @xmath55 otherwise .",
    "now , the above theorem can be stated as follows : changing any number of bits of @xmath50 causes at least one of the corresponding bits in @xmath35 to change .",
    "this means that no two different values of @xmath50 can lead to the same value of @xmath35 .",
    "there are @xmath56 possible choices for @xmath50 , and @xmath56 possible values for @xmath35 , so each possible value of @xmath35 must be associated with a unique value of @xmath50 .",
    "this applies also to @xmath57 , corresponding to global consistency .",
    "this result can be elegantly stated using a more mathematical language .",
    "the process of determining the consistency of a state defines a mapping @xmath58 of one @xmath46-bit binary number to another : @xmath59 now the status change theorem becomes simply : _ the mapping @xmath58 is bijective_. this proves the existence and uniqueness of the consistent choice since @xmath58 is a mapping from @xmath60 onto itself .",
    "in this section , we present a derivation of eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) , where the motion of the particles is related to the change in applied force by the stiffness matrix .",
    "several related derivations have already been published @xcite .",
    "the formulation presented here is distinguished from these other works in several ways .",
    "first , it incorporates sliding contacts , which is necessary to consider the uniqueness of the globally consistent contact status .",
    "the second difference is that eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) is shown to be a certain limit of newton s second law .",
    "this is essential to resolving the question of mechanism indeterminacy . on the other hand , the simplest possible form of the grains  disks in two dimensions",
    " is assumed .",
    "we first describe how interactions between the grains are modeled .",
    "we then assemble the quantities introduced here into vectors and matrices that describe all particles in the assembly .",
    "we then insert these results into newton s second law to obtain equations for the motion of the grains .",
    "then a limit of these equations is taken , leading to eq .",
    "( [ previewstiffness ] ) .",
    "a discussion of mechanism indeterminacy completes this section .",
    "we suppose that the grains interact through cohesionless repulsion and coulomb friction .",
    "we adopt the convention that a positive normal contact force @xmath16 corresponds to repulsion .",
    "thus the absence of cohesion requires @xmath61 recall that coulomb friction means that eq .",

    "( [ stable1 ] ) through ( [ stable4 ] ) . by eq .",
    "( [ wronghypothesisbis ] ) either @xmath192 or @xmath193 is negative .",
    "therefore , the only way for both of these inequalities to hold is if the sums are positive : @xmath194 this completes the induction step , and thus the proof .",
    "this work considered only circular particles .",
    "the conclusions are probably not modified if other shapes are considered .",
    "the particle shape most strongly affects the geometric stiffness , which is neglected because of the quasi - rigid assumption .",
    "the moment of inertia plays only a small role , because it is eliminated in the quasi - static approximation . to accommodate particles of different shapes , the particle radius @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( [ feqn ] ) must depend on the contact , and the torque may also depend on the normal force .",
    "this requires modifying the matrix @xmath116 . but none of these should alter our considerations of mechanism indeterminacy , nor alter the two premises of the proof used to resolve contact status indeterminacy .    another assumption that seems quite restrictive is the use of the linear force law in deriving the stiffness matrix .",
    "this is no restriction , because this paper revolves around the question of what occurs at one point in time , when the system must adjust the status of the contacts .",
    "therefore , one could always linearize the force law around the positions of the particles .",
    "a second assumption is that all possible states must be stable .",
    "this assumption is reasonable because if there is an unstable state , the packing will probably collapse , rendering the question of uniqueness irrelevant .",
    "the state that is most likely to be unstable is the one where all @xmath46 critical contacts are sliding .",
    "this is so , because the contributions of sliding contacts to the quadratic form are on the average negative @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the only way to obtain instability is for negative contributions of the sliding contacts to the quadratic form outweigh the positive contributions of the non - sliding contacts [ see discussion of eq .",
    "( [ slidingnegative ] ) ] .",
    "now , the packing is always close to this state , because when a contact becomes non - sliding , it leaves the boundary of the coulomb cone and becomes non - critical .",
    "therefore , when the assumption of stability for all possible states is violated , we expect the packing to yield .    furthermore , if there are vibrations in the system , they will be governed by eq .",
    "( [ oscillate ] ) .",
    "these vibrations will cause the relative motion at each contact to fluctuate . at critical contacts ,",
    "the contact status will therefore switch between non - sliding and sliding .",
    "thus the packing will sample many different possible states , and if it finds an unstable one , it may collapse . thus all states must be stable in order to guarantee that the vibrations will damp out , meaning that this is a necessary condition to obtain quasi - static balance .",
    "finally , let us remark that theory presented in sec .",
    "[ qqd ] requires some modifications to deal with opening and closing contacts . to account for a contact that opens ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce the status `` open '' , and allow @xmath62 to become positive .",
    "another problem is presented by contacts that are initially `` open '' but may later close . in the theory , the particle deformations are assumed to be infinitely small , so that no two particles separated by a finite distance will ever touch .",
    "this may lead to the omission of important effects when the particle separations are very small , such as in a regular packing of almost monodisperse spheres .",
    "this work suggests that the stiffness matrix , together with the principle of minimum sliding form a complete description of quasi - static granular material .",
    "since the globally consistent state always exists and is unique , there is no need to appeal to other processes that have been left out of the model to decide between various possible states . instead of rather brutally setting the particle displacements to zero ,",
    "as is done in various `` stress - only '' approaches to granular matter , one should consider taking the `` quasi - rigid '' limit , where the stiffness of the particles diverges , and the displacements become infinitesimally small , but are not set to zero . taking this limit leads to the stiffness matrix approach discussed in this paper .",
    "this work supports the conjecture that the quasi - rigid limit preserves all the necessary physics needed to describe the quasi - static behavior .",
    "of course , there remain some open questions .",
    "for example , the question of opening and closing contacts has not been dealt with .",
    "when a contact reaches the apex of the coulomb cone , it can then go into four different states .",
    "it can become non - sliding , and move into the interior of the coulomb cone .",
    "then , there are two distinct sliding states - each one corresponding to a different side of the coulomb cone . finally , the contact can open .",
    "are these four states mutually exclusive , as we have shown to be the case for the sliding and non - sliding states in this paper ?    this work should also encourage the use of numerical methods based on the stiffness matrix .",
    "the problem faced by these methods is , of course , to find the globally consistent contact status .",
    "this work shows that such a state always exists , and is unique .",
    "thus any way to find the state is acceptable .",
    "furthermore , perhaps it is possible to use the results of this paper to design intelligent strategies for finding the globally consistent state .",
