    "chromospheric variability on rotational time scales has been well - demonstrated through a variety of spectral indicators in late f- through k - type stars , due to discrete active regions crossing the visible disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as in the sun , these active regions are thought to be associated with concentrated magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , long - term cycles ( years to decades ) analogous to the 11-year solar cycle have been found in sun - like stars @xcite .    the situation with regards to chromospheric variability in the early f - type stars is less clear .",
    "the standard activity indicators become more difficult to observe and there is uncertainty as to the role of magnetic fields in driving the activity resulting from the very thin near - surface convective regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nearly all early f - type stars show at least moderately strong activity , with few if any analogs to the weak activity of the sun @xcite and no apparent dependence on age @xcite .",
    "however , within a narrow temperature range or at a specific age across all early f - type stars , a large activity range exists .    numerous uv emission lines , which stand out against the weak uv continua of these stars , as well as the optical @xmath25876 ( d@xmath0 ) absorption line have been successfully used as chromospheric activity indicators in the early f - type stars .",
    "these indicators have occasionally been used in attempts to search for variability , which is one possible explanation for the activity range in these stars .",
    "@xcite used the _ iue _ satellite to observe several uv emission lines in hertzsprung gap star @xmath3 cas in an attempt to find rotational modulation . in twenty spectra",
    "the author measured three lines , ly@xmath4 , @xmath21335 , and @xmath21549 .",
    "the observations of the two carbon lines showed standard deviations 2050% larger than the typical measurement uncertainties while the ly@xmath4 observations showed standard deviations more than twice as great as the typical measurement uncertainties .",
    "however , ly@xmath4 measurements are greatly affected by interstellar absorption and geocoronal emission , and in addition the author indicated that the measurement uncertainties may have been underestimated in some cases .",
    "@xcite observed the d@xmath0 line in @xmath5 vir 12 times , but attributed the spectrum - to - spectrum variation to inaccuracies in the removal of telluric line contamination .",
    "@xcite reported evidence for d@xmath0 variability in relatively low - precision data obtained for two early f - type open cluster stars , one in coma and the other in praesepe . despite very limited temporal coverage , the data suggested short - term variability on time scales of less than one day .",
    "finally , @xcite observed the d@xmath0 line in a variety of late - type stars , including several f - type stars .",
    "teresova reported evidence for short - term d@xmath0 variability in one early f - type star and possible evidence for long - term variability based on comparisons with d@xmath0 results from other authors .    to further explore chromospheric variability in the early f stars",
    ", we have undertaken an observing program involving high - precision measurements of d@xmath0 in 15 bright stars .",
    "a key component of this study is the uniform processing and analysis of the data , particularly important because we must remove photospheric and telluric lines that contaminate the d@xmath0 line .",
    "in addition , we pay careful attention to the uncertainties in our measurements , crucial for quantifying variability .",
    "thus , we describe our procedures in some detail , not only in support of the present work but also for related future studies using a broader dataset .",
    "we organize the rest of the paper as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the observations and the reduction to 1-dimensional spectra . in ",
    "3 we describe in detail our analysis procedures that yield d@xmath0 line parameters . in ",
    "4 we give an overview of our stellar sample . in   5 we describe the results of our search for short - term d@xmath0 variability . in   6 we describe the results of our search for long - term variability . in   7 we discuss our results and their implications . finally ,",
    "we summarize the paper in   8 .",
    "all data were obtained with the now defunct 0.9-meter coud feed telescope at kitt peak national observatory , using the echelle grating , camera 5 , and the f3 kb ccd .",
    "we used a 300 @xmath5 m slit corresponding to 2.1 arcsec projected on the sky and the dispersion was 25 m  pixel@xmath6 near the d@xmath0 line .",
    "based on measurements of th - ar lamp spectra , we obtained 2.8 pixel resolution ( 70 m , 3.6 km s@xmath6 , or @xmath7 @xmath8 85000 ) .",
    "table 1 gives an overview of the observing runs during which we obtained data .",
    "we used standard routines from the iraf echelle package for bias subtraction , flat - fielding , scattered light removal , reduction to one - dimensional spectra , continuum normalization , and wavelength calibration .",
    "for the latter , we obtained several th - ar spectra each night , and by fitting @xmath130 lines per echelle order , we obtained @xmath150 m s@xmath6 rms uncertainty in the wavelength scale on most nights .    with the large horizontal format of the ccd ( 3072 pixels ) , we cover @xmath875   in each order with about 20% overlap across adjacent orders .",
    "to perform spectral fits across a wide wavelength range , we must normalize each echelle order and `` stitch '' together the adjacent orders . the iraf continuum package allowed us to interactively fine - tune the continuum fitting to best exclude low - flux points associated with photospheric and telluric lines .",
    "thus , we could use a relatively high polynomial order without distorting the stellar lines . as discussed in   3.6",
    ", the final measurement of the d@xmath0 line involves a small portion of an echelle order which can be fitted with a low - order continuum .",
    "precise measurement of the d@xmath0 line or any other spectral line requires that the line be as unaffected as possible by other spectral features . for d@xmath0 ,",
    "adjacent photospheric lines as well as telluric water vapor lines can be serious contaminants .",
    "the latter is particularly problematic because it is highly variable .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the problem and demonstrates our ability to correct for these contaminants .",
    "as this figure shows , much of the problem lies with the telluric lines superposed on the d@xmath0 line , but it is also important to remove photospheric lines for proper continuum rectification .    we remove the photospheric lines by fitting model spectra to a large portion of our observed spectra to determine stellar rotational velocity and abundances of the relevant chemical elements , and then using this information to generate a model spectrum for the immediate d@xmath0 region .",
    "we remove the telluric lines by fitting a model to the observed target spectrum , and then using that information to properly scale a very high s / n telluric template spectrum to match the target spectrum .    in both cases",
    "we take advantage of the fact that there are photospheric and telluric lines in other portions of the spectrum that are stronger than the lines that must be removed from the d@xmath0 vicinity .",
    "thus , the absolute errors in the photospheric and telluric fits are minimized when removing the weaker lines . once we have removed the contaminating photospheric and telluric lines ,",
    "it is in principle a simple matter to measure the remaining d@xmath0 line . in the following sections we describe the entire process in more detail .",
    "we synthesized spectra with the spectrum program @xcite , which requires as inputs a line list and a stellar atmospheric model .",
    "for the former , we started with the list of solar lines given by @xcite , supplemented with robert kurucz s on - line lists .",
    "we synthesized each line individually for both a solar model ( @xmath9 = 5777 k and log @xmath10 = 4.4377 ) and a late a star ( @xmath9 = 8000 k and log @xmath10 = 4.0 ) to see which lines are important in the temperature range of our data , deleting lines with equivalent widths less than 0.1 m  in both models . through an iterative process we adjusted some of the oscillator strengths to match our own solar spectrum ( the lunar disk observed with the same equipment as the stellar observations ) . except for a small percentage of lines in the kurucz list that were grossly in error ,",
    "most differences were small , and we only adjusted lines which clearly did not match our observed spectrum . for these adjustments , we used the solar abundances tabulated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "319 , see references within ) .",
    "we assume that the photospheric lines remain constant in the stars , so to determine the elemental abundances we optimized the s / n to provide a `` key '' spectrum for each star .",
    "target information will be given in   4 , but for stars with a small number of observations , we chose the one with the highest s / n ( excluding data from a run with limited wavelength coverage ) , and for the stars that were observed several times in a night we coadded all spectra from a single night to give a very high s / n key spectrum .",
    "we chose the range 60076200   to maximize the number of elements we could fit and minimize the presence of telluric lines as this latter correction is best determined with accurate knowledge of the photospheric spectrum .",
    "for the key fits we used the levenburg - marquardt non - linear least squares method ( i.e. , the  curfit  algorithm from * ? ? ?",
    "the free parameters in the fits are the zero - point wavelength shift , microturbulent speed , @xmath11 sin @xmath12 , and the logarithmic elemental abundances .",
    "in addition to rotational broadening , we include instrumental broadening ( a gaussian with fwhm of @xmath170 m  based on the th - ar lines used for wavelength calibration ) , and macroturbulent broadening ( a polynomial approximation to the radial - tangential macroturbulence function given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pg . 1 - 18 ) corresponding to 5 km s@xmath6 for the f - type stars ) . both additional broadenings are generally small compared to @xmath11 sin @xmath12 for our stellar sample .",
    "we only perform the key fit for one spectrum ( or one summed spectrum ) for a star and use that information to produce a model spectrum for the d@xmath0 area in all spectra . however , we need an accurate wavelength shift to properly apply this model spectrum to each additional spectrum .",
    "thus , we fit the 58455865 region , which contains enough lines to provide an accurate shift and is in the same original echelle order as d@xmath0 , eliminating possible differences between the wavelength solutions in different orders .",
    "however , in this region only calcium , iron , and barium have strong enough lines for abundance determinations .",
    "we perform this fit for all spectra using the downhill simplex method ( the  amoeba  algorithm from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we prefer over `` curfit '' when fitting poorly known parameters .",
    "the information from these fits can then be used to provide good guesses for the parameters of the key fit for each star , which includes more elements as discussed below .",
    "we use the wavelength shift from the 58455865   region to derive heliocentric velocities using the iraf rvcorrect procedure .",
    "we report these velocities along with the d@xmath0 line parameters , primarily as a rough indicator of binarity .",
    "we do not report formal uncertainties for each of these measurements as the `` ameoba '' algorithm does not report them , but they typically range from about 0.20.3 km s@xmath6 for the stars with the smallest @xmath11 sin @xmath12 to as much as 12 km s@xmath6 for the stars with the largest @xmath11 sin @xmath12 .",
    "these uncertainties are far smaller than those for the d@xmath0 central wavelengths that we report and are thus not a significant source of error for these wavelengths .",
    "in addition to the two fitted spectral regions , we must model the 58805904   range ( also in the same original echelle order as d@xmath0 ) to properly determine the strength of telluric absorption , and the 58655885   region to remove the contaminating lines from the d@xmath0 vicinity .",
    "the net result is that we end up modeling the entire range from 58455904  .",
    "we used 72-level @xcite stellar models , originally generated on a temperature grid with spacing 250 k and log @xmath10 spacing of 0.5 dex . for our fits , we interpolated the models to provide 125 k and 0.1 dex spacing , respectively , for temperature and gravity .",
    "the models assume a depth - independent microturbulence of 2.0 km s@xmath6 , a reasonable choice for our stars as the actual derived microturbulences from the model fits are in the range 14 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we used the software developed by @xcite to derive the effective temperature and surface gravity from uvby@xmath3 photometry taken from the @xcite catalog .",
    "we then rounded these values to match our kurucz model grid and used that specific model for a particular star .",
    "the @xcite code also calculates stellar radii based a relationship between the strmgrem photometry and surface brightness derived by @xcite , and a slightly modified version of the @xcite relationship between surface brightness , absolute magnitude , and radius .",
    "however , we used _ hipparcos _",
    "absolute magnitudes instead of those calculated by the @xcite code .",
    "the stellar radii in turn allow us to calculate the projected rotational periods for the stars .    in the key fits",
    ", we allowed the abundances of up to nine elements to vary , including the elements that are most likely to interfere with d@xmath0 .",
    "these elements are listed in table 2 which also gives our derived solar abundances , discussed in  3.4 . for our early f - type stars",
    "we could not always reliably determine abundances for all nine elements , so we only report values for the five elements most accurately fitted in all 15 stars .",
    "this still includes all species that significantly interfere with the d@xmath0 region in f - type stars .",
    "weaker lines from approximately 20 additional elements were modeled using solar abundances .",
    "the spectrum program calculates model spectra using the lte assumption . in the early f stars ,",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for the weak to moderate line strengths we cover .",
    "we tested our fitting procedures on spectra of the sun ( the lunar disk ) and @xmath4 cmi ( procyon ; f5 iv ",
    "v ) , one of our d@xmath0 program stars .",
    "since we used the solar spectrum to adjust the @xmath13 factors , we would expect the fit to this spectrum to be an excellent match to other studies and it is .",
    "table 2 shows the results of the solar fit for a spectrum with a s / n @xmath8 500 , using a model with @xmath9 = 5770 k and log @xmath10 = 4.4377 .",
    "we found a reasonable microturbulent velocity , @xmath14 = 1.04 km s@xmath6 , and a rotational broadening , @xmath11 sin @xmath12 = 2.13 km s@xmath6 , that closely matches the solar equatorial rotation speed of 1.98 km s@xmath6 .",
    "table 3 lists similar data for a spectrum of procyon with s",
    "/ n @xmath8 300 , using a model with @xmath9 = 6625 k and log @xmath10 = 4.1 .",
    "we found @xmath14 = 1.85 km s@xmath6 and @xmath11 sin @xmath12 = 5.78 km s@xmath6 .",
    "these values compare well with other studies ; e.g. , @xmath14 = 2.1 km s@xmath6 by @xcite from a curve - of - growth analysis and @xmath14 = 1.9 km s@xmath6 by @xcite via a similar procedure to ours . @xcite",
    "derived @xmath11 sin @xmath12 = 4.9 km s@xmath6 and @xcite found @xmath11 sin @xmath12 = 7 km s@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite used a model with @xmath9 = 6696 k , so to provide a further comparision to our fit , we also performed a fit with @xmath9 = 6750 k. this choice brackets the @xcite fit with the two most similar models from our grid and we give the results of both of our fits in table 3 . additionally , this provides an estimate of the uncertainties in our quoted abundances based on the temperature uncertainty , which @xcite report as about 2.5% ( @xmath1160180",
    "k ) in the temperature range covered by our sample .",
    "we see that the resulting abundance uncertainties resulting from the temperature calibration are less than 0.1 dex for the five elements reported for the rest of our sample .",
    "our procedure for removing telluric water vapor lines is essentially identical to that used in previous papers @xcite so we only give a brief overview here .",
    "@xcite catalogued the telluric water vapor lines in the range 58685917  , which accounts for virtually all telluric absorption in this wavelength range .",
    "the strongest telluric lines within this range are near the sodium d lines , which were covered by the same echelle order as d@xmath0 in our spectra .",
    "with @xmath11 sin @xmath12 and wavelength shifts known from the 58455865 synthetic spectral fits , we generated an approximate synthetic photospheric spectrum for the range 58845904   to flag pixels that are significantly affected by photospheric lines and totally exclude them from the telluric model fit .",
    "we then fitted the telluric model to the remaining pixels based on the line catalog .",
    "since the water vapor lines scale together , this gives one parameter describing the strength of the lines for that exposure .",
    "we produced a very high s / n template of the telluric spectrum by observing a rapidly rotating , unreddened hot star ( regulus ) and using the continuum routine in iraf to `` flatten '' the few shallow photospheric lines .",
    "we scaled the template based on the telluric line strength in each target spectrum derived from the model fits , and this scaled template provides the telluric removal . by using this technique , we avoided issues with minor imperfections in the modeling of the weak telluric lines near d@xmath0 since we divided through an actual observed spectrum instead of the model .      after dividing the target spectrum by the photospheric model and the scaled telluric spectrum , we are left with a spectrum that should only contain d@xmath0 absorption . as with the telluric correction ,",
    "our techniques are similar to those used in previous work @xcite .",
    "one potential problem with the construction of the original target spectra is that we must use a relatively high - order polynomial fit to normalize each order of the spectrum , mostly due to the echelle blaze function .",
    "while this works well for the spectrum as a whole , there is the risk of small differences from spectrum to spectrum due to the variability of the telluric lines and putative variability in the d@xmath0 line , which may change the exact pixels that are included in the continuum fit .",
    "for instance , more pixels may be excluded in the d@xmath0 vicinity if the telluric and d@xmath0 absorption are strong .",
    "while we did not see any obvious problems in the normalized spectra , we wanted to be conservative in our search for variability .",
    "the original continuum can accurately be fitted with a third - order polynomial in the narrow range around d@xmath0 , thus we applied the photospheric and telluric corrections to the unnormalized spectra .",
    "the d@xmath0 line is typically broadened in excess of the stellar @xmath11 sin @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "thus , while the observed d@xmath0 profiles are not simply gaussian nor the @xmath11 sin @xmath12 `` bowl '' function , at the level of precision of our spectra a gaussian provides a good match to the profiles .",
    "importantly , this gives us an analytic fitting function for which it is easy to generate formal uncertainties in our derived equivalent widths , crucial for assessing variability .",
    "thus , we performed a 7-parameter fit for each spectrum using the curfit routine : central wavelength ( @xmath15 ) , gaussian width ( @xmath16 ) , gaussian depth ( @xmath17 ) , and a 3rd order continuum .",
    "the equivalent width of a gaussian absorption profile in a normalized spectrum is then simply @xmath18 with the final uncertainty in equivalent width calculated with standard error propagation techniques based on the formal uncertainties in @xmath16 and @xmath17 .      to assess the existence of variability",
    ", we must be certain that the uncertainties on the individual d@xmath0 measurements are accurately determined . to verify that the uncertainties reported by the fitting routine were correct , we performed monte carlo simulations whereby we generated `` perfect '' d@xmath0 profiles ( plus continuum ) that matched the results of fits for several stellar spectra .",
    "then we added a large number of random noise vectors to each profile corresponding to the measured s / n of the original spectrum .",
    "we then fitted these simulated noisy profiles in the same way as the actual data .",
    "we found that the simulated profiles produced d@xmath0 equivalent widths with uncertainties and standard deviations within 15% of the originally derived values for that spectrum , while the mean equivalent widths of the simulated lines provided nearly exact matches to the actual lines .",
    "the results for the central wavelengths and line widths were similar , and indicate that we are not strongly over or underestimating the uncertainties on the individual measurements we report .",
    "however , given the relatively small sample sizes , a 15% underestimate of the uncertainties is sometimes enough to significantly affect the interpretation of the results and this will be discussed in more detail in   5.1 .",
    "we mostly attribute the small differences between the actual spectra and the simulations to slight inaccuracies in the telluric and photospheric line removals , and slight differences between the true shape of the observed d@xmath0 lines and a gaussian .",
    "with the exception of four stars that were extensively observed throughout a specific observing run , most of the observations were taken during non - optimal observing conditions when we could not observe fainter targets ; i.e. , light to moderate cloudiness or twilight .",
    "thus , we were limited to stars with @xmath19 @xmath20 5 .",
    "in addition , the weak d@xmath0 line becomes much more difficult to detect with large rotational broadening , so we limited the sample to @xmath11 sin @xmath12 @xmath20 100 km s@xmath6 .",
    "our goal was to obtain continuum s / n ratios around 200300 , yielding d@xmath0 equivalent width precision of about 510% for targets with `` normal '' line strengths ; this goal was not achieved in all cases .",
    "table 4 lists the program stars along with pertinent photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "in addition to data from the _ hipparcos catalog _ @xcite we also quote a more uniform set of modern spectral types that provide a much better match to our effective temperatures and surface gravities calculated as described in   3.2 .",
    "figure 2 gives the positions of each star in a color - magnitude diagram of nearby stars observed by _",
    "hipparcos_. in table 5 , we give the results of our synthetic spectral fits , including microturbulence , rotational velocity , rotational period , and elemental abundances . our sample can be broadly described as ranging from one - half solar metallicity to full solar metallicity , and our [ fe / h ] values agree well with previous measurements .",
    "we had particular reasons for observing two of the four stars for which we investigated short - term variability .",
    "we observed 18 boo due to highly discrepant literature values of the d@xmath0 equivalent width ( 40 m  from @xcite and 10 @xmath21 5 m  from @xcite .",
    "in addition , as discussed in   1 , @xmath5 vir has already been the subject of a search for d@xmath0 variability .",
    "although our observations were made before the @xcite study , there are several additional targets in common between our studies .",
    "we have reported d@xmath0 equivalent widths for nine of these stars in a previous work @xcite .",
    "we reanalyzed those spectra for the present study to provide a uniform comparison with the newer observations .",
    "in particular , our photospheric fitting and modeling procedure has improved by determining specific abundances for each element for each star , and we model the d@xmath0 lines as gaussians in the present work as opposed to a wavelength - by - wavelength summation .",
    "our present equivalent widths are generally slightly smaller than the previously reported values , which we mostly attribute to better photospheric line removal , but otherwise the agreement is reasonable .",
    "we emphasize that it is somewhat difficult to precisely compare sets of d@xmath0 measurements that have not been processed in exactly the same way due to the telluric and photospheric line removals .",
    "in tables 6 through 9 we give observing information and resulting d@xmath0 parameters for the 100 spectra of four stars we used for the investigation of short - term variability , including a few spectra taken to search for long - term variability which will be discussed in   6.2 .",
    "the s / n was determined in the vicinity of the d@xmath0 line , but varies somewhat across the overall spectrum .",
    "we also give heliocentric radial velocities , which illustrate that we do not see significant radial velocity variability for these stars .",
    "we have numbered the spectra in the tables so we can refer to them individually in further discussion . in all cases , we have also listed the observing run for each observation using the same notation as table 1 to provide a simpler context for the timing of the observations than the julian dates .",
    "we give the central wavelengths of the d@xmath0 lines in the rest frame of the star , based on the photospheric line fits in the 58455865   range .",
    "the reported uncertainties do not explicitly include the wavelength uncertainty of the photospheric fits or possible run - to - run differences in the wavelength solutions , but these errors are typically much smaller than the errors in the d@xmath0 fits . for convenience",
    ", we have converted the gaussian linewidths into the full width at half maximum expressed in km s@xmath6 , which can then be compared with @xmath11 sin @xmath12 for the star .    to explore the existence of short - term variability , we begin by calculating various statistics on the measurements of equivalent width , central wavelength , and linewidth . table 10",
    "gives a summary of these values .",
    "for each quantity we have tabulated the weighted mean , the weighted standard deviation , and the mean uncertainty of the individual measurements .",
    "we chose the mean uncertainty instead of the median uncertainty because the mean was usually slightly larger , giving a slightly more conservative basis for comparing the standard deviation and measurement uncertainties .",
    "still , a comparison between the standard deviation and typical uncertainties immediately illustrates that we may be seeing significant variability in our sample .    a more formal way to assess variability",
    "is to perform a @xmath22 test on @xmath23 measurements of a quantity @xmath24 with error @xmath16 relative to the null - hypothesis of non - variability using the equation @xmath25 and @xmath26 degrees of freedom .",
    "this measures the probability that the sample does not represent a constant variable with normally distributed deviations from the mean , which we call the variability probability .",
    "we performed this test not only using the measurement uncertainties reported in tables 6 through 9 , but also for the possibility that our uncertainties are underestimated by 15% , as discussed in   3.7 .",
    "these results are given in table 11 and will be discussed on a star - by - star basis .",
    "we can use similar ideas to determine the statistical significance of the difference between two measurements of a value @xmath24 with error @xmath16 , using the z - statistic : @xmath27 we use this test mostly for long - term variability , but also occasionally in the short - term dataset .    in figures 46 , we show the time series for equivalent width , central wavelength , and linewidth for each of the four stars . for convenience",
    ", we have expressed the central wavelengths as a velocity relative to the average d@xmath0 wavelength in the sample , 5875.72  , consistent with the expected central wavelength of the multiplet .",
    "this will make it easier to assess whether any apparent wavelength shifts are a large fraction of the rotational velocity of the stars .    before discussing each star",
    ", we note that since there are several telluric lines within the d@xmath0 profiles , if our removal process does not work well we might see a dependence of the equivalent width on the strength of telluric absorption during that particular exposure .",
    "figure 7 shows this data for each star .",
    "the `` telluric line depth '' corresponds to the strongest line in the vicinity of the sodium d lines , which is much stronger than the lines that interfere with d@xmath0 .",
    "clearly , we see no statistically significant trend of d@xmath0 line strength with telluric line strength .    in the following sections , we discuss the four stars from least to most evidence of short - term variability in the d@xmath0 line strength .",
    "this star falls well within the usual temperature and spectral class range for early f - type stars and lies at the bottom of the _ hipparcos _ main sequence in figure 2 .",
    "it has an m - type companion which is 8 magnitudes fainter visually @xcite , so it does not contribute light to our spectra . @xcite report large radial velocity variability with a standard deviation of 15.0 km s@xmath6 based on 3 measurements covering 3.1 years .",
    "our data cover a 5.0-year period and show at most slight evidence for low - level long - term variability relative to the @xmath10.5 km s@xmath6 uncertainties , and our velocities are similar to others referenced by simbad .",
    "we observed the star twice per night during each of the 8 nights of the sp97 run . in this dataset , the equivalent width , central wavelength , and linewidth show weighted standard deviations that are about 1025% greater than the mean uncertainties of the original values .",
    "thus , as table 6 indicates , a claim of variability requires that our uncertainties are accurately specified .",
    "the time series in figure 4 shows that there is one observation with a small equivalent width ( number 10 in table 6 ) , and that both observations from the 6th night ( numbers 13 and 14 in table 6 ) are relatively high .",
    "these three points provide almost exactly half of the total @xmath22 , and even with our reported measurement uncertainties , the @xmath22 probability is not at a level where we would claim variability .",
    "the variability probabilities are greater for both central wavelength and fwhm .",
    "the central wavelength does not show a particular pattern , but rather a scatter that appears larger than the uncertainties while remaining a small fraction of @xmath11 sin @xmath12 .",
    "the fwhm mostly follows the pattern seen for equivalent width , but with larger differences between the two nightly measurements for several nights .",
    "overall , we do not find strong evidence for variability in the strength of the d@xmath0 line in @xmath28 gem .",
    "the evidence is slightly stronger for the central wavelength and linewidth , but requires that our measurement uncertainties are not underestimated .",
    "this is clearly a late f - type star that falls under the category of `` solar - type , '' i.e. , it is on the cool side of the point near spectral type f5 where stars begin to show activity levels related to the strength of the magnetic dynamo via rotational speed and age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "as figure 2 shows , this star appears to be about twice as luminous as a zero - age main sequence star of the same color , thus it is either near the end of its main sequence lifetime or is a binary system with nearly equal components .",
    "we see some evidence for radial velocity variations in our data , and @xcite indicate both radial velocity variability and an advanced age for this star ( 3.1 gyr )",
    ". however , we did not detect spectral lines from a secondary star , and presume that any companion is faint .",
    "another possibility is that the two stars show minimal velocity separation due to their orbit , e.g. , a small inclination . in that case",
    ", the two stars would have to have very similar spectral types , abundances , and rotational velocities .",
    "speckle interferometry by @xcite constrains any companion to a separation of less than 0.03 and @xmath30 greater than 1.5 mag . for our purposes ,",
    "this star was chosen due to small @xmath11 sin @xmath12 , strong d@xmath0 line , and its brightness , which gave us the most precise data of the four stars with integration times of 20 minutes .",
    "we obtained repeated observations of this star in two different observing runs .",
    "in the sp97 run , we obtained 7 spectra over the course of 5 consecutive observing nights , while in the sp98 run , we obtained 12 spectra across 6 of the 7 nights .",
    "figures 46 show both of these time series .",
    "we only see limited evidence for variability in equivalent width or fwhm in both runs .",
    "the @xmath22 value and resulting probability for equivalent width variability in the sp98 run is fairly large , but most of the total @xmath22 is due to a single point , number 17 in table 7 .",
    "still , we see nothing unusual about the spectrum or the fit that would invalidate this point .",
    "if we compare this value with that from the 18th exposure taken 4.6 hours later , the z - statistic gives a 3.3@xmath16 difference , corresponding to only a 0.1% probability that these two values result from a purely statistical variation .",
    "the @xmath22 values indicate strong support for variability in the central wavelengths , particularly in the sp97 run .",
    "figure 5 clearly shows the putative variation , which covers a range of about 5 km s@xmath6 as compared with @xmath11 sin @xmath12 = 31.8 km s@xmath6 . as noted in table 5 , we calculate a maximum possible rotational period ( @xmath31/sin @xmath12 ) of 2.8 days for this star .",
    "thus , the combination of a statistically constant d@xmath0 equivalent width with an apparent oscillation in the central wavelength over a few days would be consistent with rotational modulation of one or more strong active longitudes analogous to the sun .",
    "the low amplitude of the velocity variation in the line would imply that the overall activity was broadly distributed across the disk .",
    "while this is a plausible hypothesis , the data from the sp98 run do not as clearly show this pattern , although the central wavelength does appear to be variable .      as noted in   1 , there is some evidence in the literature for chromospheric variability .",
    "as seen in figure 2 , this star is located at the top of the _ hipparcos _ main sequence , consistent with being slightly evolved , although our derived surface gravity is similar to main sequence stars .",
    "it is also the brightest star of the short - term variability sample and thus we were able to obtain 26 observations during the 8 nights of the sp98 run with typical integration times of 15 minutes . as with @xmath28 gem ,",
    "@xcite report significant radial velocity variability with a standard deviation of 12.4 km s@xmath6 in 3 measurements covering 1.4 years .",
    "@xcite reported possible variability of about 10 km s@xmath6 in 21 measurements spread over 4.8 years with a possible period of 0.9 years .",
    "however , our measurements over 4.1 years ( with intervals between observations of 1.2 , 1.3 , and 1.7 years ) only support the possibility of a years - scale variation of up to 2 km s@xmath6 , a much smaller range than either previous dataset .",
    "the @xmath22 analysis provides strong evidence for equivalent width variability in our sample .",
    "this variation is most easily seen in figure 4 by comparing the first and fourth night s worth of data .",
    "interestingly , the appearance in the time series is that of a gradual rise in activity over the first four nights , followed by a decrease . however , the value of the maximum possible rotational period ( @xmath31/sin @xmath12 ) in table 5 is just 2.2 days .",
    "thus , this trend represents a more gradual variation than would be explained by rotation . in addition to night - to - night variability",
    ", the time series also indicates variability within a single night , particularly on the final night .",
    "we do not find significant periodicities at either time scale with a periodogram analysis .",
    "the variability probabilities for central wavelength are extremely close to 1 .",
    "this variability is evident in the time series in figure 5 and appears strongest on short time scales within a night .",
    "the total range of the line centers is 15 km s@xmath6 which is still a relatively small fraction of the d@xmath0 line width or @xmath11 sin @xmath12 .",
    "a key point is that the variability occurs on a much shorter timescale than rotation .    in a statistical sense ,",
    "the variability in the wavelength is more pronounced than that for the equivalent width .",
    "one possibility is that if the activity is spread across the disk in some way , a rapid redistribution in point - to - point activity levels could affect the disk - averaged central wavelength without affecting the equivalent width as much .",
    "one test of this hypothesis would be to look for subtle line asymmetries , but at the s / n of our data we can not confirm this possibility .",
    "as already noted , the literature values for the d@xmath0 equivalent width significantly disagree .",
    "the star lies near the bottom of the _ hipparcos _ main sequence in figure 2 , and it is a possible member of the ursa major moving group @xcite , which would also imply a relatively young age of 300500 myr .",
    "our radial velocities in table 9 show no evidence for variability nor did we locate other evidence to support classification as a spectroscopic binary although it is a wide visual binary .",
    "this star shows very strong evidence for line strength variability , the strongest in the present sample .",
    "figure 4 clearly shows the variability , and the probabilities in table 11 are very large .",
    "the variability on the 4th and 7th nights is highly pronounced and covers a large fraction of the range seen in the full sample .",
    "in contrast , the line strength is tightly clustered on the 5th night .",
    "it is important to note that the observed variability in 18 boo on the 4th and 7th nights is not matched by @xmath5 vir on those nights . for all spectra of the two stars ,",
    "if one star was observed the other star was observed immediately before and/or after .",
    "this gives further support to the hypothesis that our observed variability is not a data analysis artifact .",
    "as with @xmath5 vir , we do not find strong evidence for periodicities in the time series .    to further illustrate the line variability , we show a stack plot of all 25 spectra from the sp98 run in figure 8 , along with the gaussian fits",
    ". the variability can be most clearly seen near the top , as well as when looking closely at the variable spacing between adjacent spectra at the line core , despite the uniform spacing of the continua .",
    "the variability probabilities for the linewidths are similar to those for line strength .",
    "a comparison of figures 4 and 6 indicate that the putative variability in both quantities is related and this relationship between equivalent width and fwhm is most pronounced for 18 boo .",
    "the variability probabilities are smaller for the central wavelength . the total velocity range of about 12 km s@xmath6 is covered by the spectra on the first night , with a smaller range for the rest of the data . as with @xmath5 vir",
    ", the implication is that the variability is operating on non - rotational timescales .",
    "based on our measurements , we believe that the large difference in the two previous literature values of equivalent width represents the same variability that we have observed .",
    "indeed , those measurements provide a good match to the high and low values of equivalent width that we report .",
    "as one final additional test of our d@xmath0 results , we fitted several photospheric lines to see if those lines appeared variable . since 18 boo shows the strongest evidence for d@xmath0 variability , we give those results in table 12 , which are also representative of @xmath5 vir .",
    "we see that for two lines that are somewhat stronger than d@xmath0 and one line that is comparable to the weakest d@xmath0 measurement , the standard deviation of the line measurements is nearly identical to the measurement uncertainties .",
    "a @xmath22 analysis gives variability probabilities generally in the range 0.40.8 , supporting the idea that our measurement techniques are not creating the appearance of variability in the d@xmath0 lines where none is present .",
    "out of the nine probabilities , only one is greater than 0.9 , but that is for the central wavelength of the weakest line , and only a few of our d@xmath0 lines in 18 boo are that weak .",
    "furthermore , a gaussian is not as good of a match to the photospheric lines as for the d@xmath0 line and that might contribute to larger fluctuations in the fits .",
    "we obtained additional measurements of the four stars in the short - term sample to look for long - term variability and those measurements have already been presented in tables 69 .",
    "table 13 provides measurements of an additional eleven stars for which we obtained measurements in at least two different observing runs and we give the same data as for the short - term sample . in the rest of this section we make note of literature values of the d@xmath0 equivalent width where available .",
    "while one can not exactly compare these results due to differences in the telluric and photospheric line removal procedures , those values should at least be similar to ours if there is no variability .",
    "as with the short - term study , we give heliocentric radial velocities . again",
    ", we want to make sure that the d@xmath0 lines are not being `` polluted '' by a cooler star or that binarity is affecting the activity levels . in no case did we see any spectral lines from a secondary component .      as seen in tables 69 , for all four stars in the short - term sample we obtained spectra in at least three additional observing runs . these values are broadly consistent with the short - term variability ( or lack thereof ) seen in the large samples within a single observing run .",
    "the evidence for equivalent width variability for both @xmath28 gem and @xmath29 boo becomes more significant when including the additional data .",
    "for @xmath28 gem , three out of the four additional spectra ( numbers 1 , 2 , and 20 in table 6 ) show equivalent widths considerably smaller than the bulk of the sp97 sample .",
    "in fact , these values match the single low point ( number 10 ) seen in that sample . if we include all 20 measurements of @xmath28 gem , the probability of equivalent width variability rises to 0.994 with our reported uncertainties and 0.926 if our uncertainties are underestimated by 15% .",
    "our two sets of observations for @xmath29 boo indicate long - term variability . if we compare the values in table 10 , 41.1 @xmath21 1.6 m  for sp97 and 33.3 @xmath21 3.2 m  for sp98 , we derive a 2.2@xmath16 difference using the z - statistic , and that does not take into account a @xmath32 reduction in the uncertainty if we used the sample standard deviation .",
    "notably , all seven equivalent widths from sp97 are larger than all twelve values from sp98 .",
    "previous investigators have reported equivalent widths for all four stars .",
    "we have already mentioned that the previously discrepant 18 boo measurements are consistent with our observed variability .",
    "previous values for @xmath28 gem match the high end of our measurements ; 38 m  from @xcite and 7 measurements of 30.048.2 m  from @xcite .",
    "@xcite found an average equivalent width for @xmath5 vir of 19 m  from 12 measurements , somewhat smaller than our average of 28.5 m .",
    "finally , @xcite found an equivalent width of 35 m  for @xmath29 boo and @xcite found 27.736.2 m  in 5 measurements ; these values are generally consistent with ours .",
    "this star lies well above the main sequence in the hertzsprung gap , and has by far the smallest surface gravity in our sample .",
    "the star has one of the largest @xmath11 sin @xmath12 values in the sample , and thus the radial velocities are particularly uncertain and not indicative of variability . we have already mentioned the possible uv emission line variability in   1 .",
    "as found by @xcite , giant stars in this temperature range show similar d@xmath0 equivalent widths as dwarfs , and our d@xmath0 equivalent widths for @xmath3 cas are typical for early f - type stars .",
    "the first two equivalent widths are statistically identical , but the third value differs from the second value at the 2.0@xmath16 level .",
    "interestingly , while the central wavelengths of the d@xmath0 line are not statistically variable , they consistently deviate to the blue .",
    "an average of the three measurements yields 5875.41 @xmath21 0.15  , or a blueshift of 16 @xmath21 7 km s@xmath6 relative to the 5875.72   mean found for the short - term sample .",
    "@xcite found similar blueshifts for the o iv ] 1401 , c iv 1548 , and c iv 1550 lines and similar amounts of excess broadening beyond the photospheric @xmath11 sin @xmath12 .",
    "these lines form at temperatures near 10@xmath33 k , while the d@xmath0 line is thought to form at temperatures near 10@xmath34 k. however , other uv emission lines that form at temperatures comparable to d@xmath0 did not show these blueshifts .",
    "this star is one of the best - studied @xmath35 doradus non - radial pulsating variables @xcite .",
    "there is a 12th magnitude m - type component 5 arcsec from the main star which is too faint to affect our spectra .",
    "our first d@xmath0 measurement is rather uncertain , but no variability is detected .",
    "this star lies very near 9 aur on the _ hipparcos _ color - magnitude diagram in figure 2 with similar temperature and gravity , but appears not to show significant photometric or radial velocity variability .",
    "in particular , @xcite report statistically constant radial velocity in 13 measurements covering 16.3 years and our three measurements spanning 1.3 years agree with this conclusion .",
    "the equivalent widths and line widths for the three observations are statistically identical",
    ". however , the central wavelength for the first and second observations disagree at the 2.9@xmath16 level based on the z - statistic .",
    "the wavelength difference corresponds to a velocity difference of 3.9 @xmath21 1.2 km s@xmath6 , a small fraction of @xmath11 sin @xmath12 = 17.4 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this implies a situation similar to that for @xmath5 vir where there may be some sort of redistribution of activity that causes little if any equivalent width variability , but slightly distorts the shape of the line leading to a change in the measured line center .",
    "procyon was observed not only because it is the brightest main sequence f - type star , but also because at spectral type f5 and @xmath37 = 0.42 it is at the high temperature edge of solar - type stars which show activity - rotation - age correlations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this star exhibits low - amplitude variability in the ca ii h & k lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a d@xmath0 equivalent width of 5 m  and our three values are similar and highly consistent , as are the line widths .    in contrast , the central wavelength of the second observation is considerably bluer than the other two measurements .",
    "the z - statistic indicates that the second and third measurements differ at the 2.8@xmath16 level .",
    "given that this appears to be a solar - type star , the situation may be similar to what we found for @xmath29 boo , a variation in wavelength due to rotational modulation of active regions .",
    "it is important to note that the first two observations were made just 5 days apart and @xmath31/sin @xmath12 for procyon is 18.5 days , thus our observations likely cover something close to one - quarter of a full rotation .",
    "the wavelength difference between these two observations corresponds to 12 @xmath21 7 km s@xmath6 . recall that we found @xmath11 sin @xmath12 = 5.3 km s@xmath6 , which would also be the maximum observable velocity range for one - quarter of a period . @xcite",
    "derive @xmath11 sin @xmath12 = 3.2 km s@xmath6 from a more sophisticated 3-dimensional model atmosphere .",
    "thus , our results are statistically consistent with rotational modulation , with the caveat that our first measurement is rather uncertain .",
    "this star is an interesting case due to the very weak d@xmath0 line for an otherwise normal , but slightly evolved early f - type star .",
    "we see evidence for long - term radial velocity variability , but this mostly appears in the sp95 observation for which there may be a slight zero - point offset relative to other runs due to the more limited wavelength coverage .",
    "we did not find significant evidence for radial velocity variability in the literature .",
    "for the four spectra in which we could measure the d@xmath0 line at the 2@xmath16 level or greater , the measurements are statistically identical . we were unable to obtain a statistically significant d@xmath0 detection in the sp98 data , but given the weakness of the line in the other spectra , this non - detection is consistent with the other measurements .",
    "although somewhat uncertain , the linewidths are relatively narrow . the weighted mean and weighted standard deviation for the four d@xmath0 detections give fwhm = 35 @xmath21 13 km s@xmath6 , as compared with @xmath11 sin @xmath12 = 27.5 km s@xmath6 .",
    "although @xmath16 boo ( see below ) has a very narrow d@xmath0 line , it also has very small @xmath11 sin @xmath12 , and @xmath38 leo is the only star in our present sample with an average d@xmath0 linewidth only slightly broader than photospheric lines . for comparison , @xmath4 cmi also shows a consistently weak d@xmath0 line , but with fwhm = 5657 km s@xmath6 , indicating the effects of greater thermal and turbulent broadening for d@xmath0 as compared with photospheric lines .    in principle , a small equivalent width for a d@xmath0 line in an f - type star suggests a low active - region filling factor @xcite ,",
    "although the hottest star considered in that study was 6500 k. in turn , a small active - region filling factor would generally produce a narrower line than the case of a larger filling factor , particularly if the activity were constrained to a limited longitude range and/or high latitudes .",
    "@xcite found one other case of an unusually narrow d@xmath0 line in a pleiades star ( h ii 1266 ) , but in that case the d@xmath0 line was clearly narrower than @xmath11 sin @xmath12 even when not compensating for the larger thermal and turbulent broadening for d@xmath0 .",
    "activity concentrated at high latitudes was invoked to explain the contradiction in linewidths . in that case , @xmath11 sin @xmath12 = 76.6 km s@xmath6 , so it was much easier to rule out spectrum - to - spectrum wavelength shifts in the d@xmath0 line to within very small fraction of rotational broadening and thus mostly rule out rotational modulation of an active region at a single stellar longitude . since @xmath38 leo has one - third as much rotational broadening as the pleiades star , our wavelength uncertainties amount to 1020% of @xmath11 sin @xmath12 .",
    "thus , even though our d@xmath0 central wavelengths show no variability within the precision of our measurements , we can not as easily rule out rotational modulation .",
    "this star lies at the bottom of the _ hipparcos _ main sequence , although the spectral classification indicates a slightly evolved star .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity difference between our two observations would be statistically significant , but as already mentioned , we have concerns about the zero - point of the sp95 observations .",
    "@xcite find a strong likelihood of radial velocity variability in 20 measurements over 14.9 years .",
    "we see no significant difference between the two d@xmath0 measurements .",
    "this star lies at the bottom of the _ hipparcos _ main sequence .",
    "@xcite found radial velocity scatter less of than 0.1 km s@xmath6 based on high - precision observations used in a search for exoplanets .",
    "note that our velocities are about 1 km s@xmath6 greater than theirs , which gives some indication of the systematic errors that may exist in our radial velocity measurements .",
    "the two d@xmath0 equivalent widths differ by 2.4@xmath16 via the z - statistic .",
    "the literature values are consistent with the possibility of variability as @xcite found an equivalent width of 8 m , while @xcite found 19.0 m . our central wavelength and linewidth measurements are not statistically different .",
    "this star has the largest @xmath11 sin @xmath12 in our sample .",
    "it has a wide companion nearly 2 arcmin away which is itself a long - period binary ( @xmath40 boo ) .",
    "photographic spectra indicate at best low - amplitude radial velocity variability @xcite .",
    "our data is also of relatively low precision due to the large @xmath11 sin @xmath12 and low s / n for the observation that appears to differ from the other two .    the two observations in which we detect d@xmath0 show reasonable statistical agreement .",
    "we do not conclusively detect d@xmath0 in the low quality observation .",
    "however , depending on the width of a putative d@xmath0 line , the 2@xmath16 upper limit could be comparable the other observations .",
    "our d@xmath0 measurements are statistically identical and given the relatively large @xmath11 sin @xmath12 and the possible zero - point issue with the sp95 data , the heliocentric radial velocities are likely non - variable .",
    "@xcite found an equivalent width of 23 m  and @xcite found 29.2 m , broadly consistent with our values .",
    "this star is a single - line spectroscopic binary with a period of 3.8 years @xcite .",
    "our two radial velocity measurements are broadly comparable to those results .",
    "the wavelength of the d@xmath0 line differs by 2.2@xmath16 between the two observations , but the line strength and width are nearly identical .",
    "this star is a visual binary with @xmath30 = 4.0 and a separation of 14.4 arcsec .",
    "our radial velocities suggest variability , as do the three observations by @xcite covering 263 days .",
    "however , the d@xmath0 measurements are nearly identical in all three parameters .",
    "our results for 18 boo and to a lesser extent @xmath5 vir appear to establish the reality of short - term chromospheric variability in some fraction of early f - type stars .",
    "both stars appear to be single with no reported optical variability in _ hipparcos _ observations or other literature sources .",
    "stellar parameters are quite similar for the two stars , although @xmath5 vir appears to be somewhat evolved towards the terminal - age main sequence while 18 boo appears to be very near the zero - age main sequence , consistent with its possible membership in the ursa major moving group .",
    "the physical nature of this variability is not clear , but we can explore various situations involving rotation . while we do not know the sin @xmath12 factors for individual stars , the maximum possible value of @xmath11 should be similar to or less than the largest @xmath11 sin @xmath12 seen in young clusters . for the pleiades and alpha persei clusters ,",
    "@xcite found early f - type stars with @xmath11 sin @xmath12 @xmath1 200 km s@xmath6 . even in that extreme case ,",
    "the rotational period would still be @xmath18 hours and pure rotational modulation of isolated active regions would not seem to be responsible for the variability we see .",
    "furthermore , even in the early f - type stars , rotation slows down with age and with decreasing effective temperature .",
    "in fact , for the temperature range of our field stars , @xmath42 sin @xmath43 is about 3050 km s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "thus , the three early f - type stars in the short - term sample have nearly average values of @xmath11 sin @xmath12 and are not likely to be viewed nearly pole - on .",
    "thus the rotational periods will be much closer to the values in table 5 than they are to the hypothetical minimum value of @xmath18 hours .",
    "we have already noted that we do not find any clear periodicities in the equivalent widths , albeit the temporal coverage is limited .",
    "furthermore , the d@xmath0 line in this temperature range is purely chromospheric , e.g. , in the sun the line is only seen in conjuction with plages @xcite .",
    "thus , the line only samples the portions of the rotational broadening function at speeds corresponding to the apparent velocities at those stellar longitudes .",
    "if we were seeing rotational modulation of a small number of isolated active regions , we should see velocity shifts ( or asymmetries ) in the d@xmath0 line that are a large fraction of @xmath11 sin @xmath12 , unless the active regions are all at high latitudes .",
    "however , figure 5 clearly shows that such large shifts are not observed .",
    "the total velocity range of the d@xmath0 line for both 18 boo and @xmath5 vir is less than 20% of the quantity 2 @xmath44 @xmath11 sin @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the rotational modulation produced by high - latitude features would be less likely to explain the full range of equivalent width variation that is seen for these two stars .",
    "another aspect of significant axial inclination is that we would mostly be observing polar regions . in the sun",
    ", activity is concentrated near the equator , thus in other stars with sun - like activity , over time we should see activity covering the full range of equatorial rotation . however , the other consequence of observing polar regions is the possibility of significant stellar oblateness .",
    "interferometric studies of rapidly rotating ( @xmath1200 km s@xmath6 ) a - type stars indicates that such stars can be highly oblate , which causes the surface temperature to be considerably hotter in the polar regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , a star may be cool enough at the equator for convective activity while being hot enough near the poles to shut off convection .",
    "this effect could influence the observed strength and distribution of active regions on the star and thus the appearence of chromospheric spectral features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , we have no evidence that the stars in our sample are rotating at such high speeds . plus , this effect would merely mimic the observed situation on the sun where activity tends to lie near the equator .",
    "our results suggest that the observed variability must either result from some sort of global phenomenon or significant variations of a large number of small active regions",
    ". either of these possibilities could produce significant short - term activity variations without large velocity variations or obvious periodicity , and thus no observable relationship with rotation .    as a final note on short - term variability ,",
    "it is worth considering in more detail the actual distribution of equivalent width values in our sample .",
    "we have already shown with the @xmath22 analysis that the equivalent widths for both 18 boo and @xmath5 vir significantly differ from a gaussian distribution of width comparable to the measurement uncertainties . in figure 9",
    ", we give histograms of the equivalent widths for both stars .",
    "if changes in activity were mostly the result of some level of flaring on top of a basal level of activity , we might expect many points for a star to be clustered in the low end of the distribution with a noticeable `` tail '' of larger equivalent widths .",
    "if the activity were somehow related to a `` high / low state '' phenomenon we would expect a bimodal distribution .",
    "( a similar result would occur if we were seeing a purely sinusoidal variation whereby the star would spend more time near the peak and trough of the variation . )",
    "however , we see nothing conclusive in the distributions . for both stars",
    "the distributions look like something in between a broad gaussian and a uniform distribution , with just a couple of high points for 18 boo .",
    "admittedly , with our limited number of data points , the @xmath32 errors are large in the histograms , but the point is that we do not see a clear pattern that would indicate a well - defined mode of variability .    as for the long - term variations , we can only claim 2@xmath16 variability in the d@xmath0 equivalent width for two of the eleven stars in the purely long - term sample , @xmath3 cas and @xmath16 boo .",
    "given the apparent short - term variability we have found in @xmath5 vir and 18 boo , it may be difficult to claim long - term variability based on a small number of measurements because a significant difference between two measurements widely separated in time might simply be due to the short - term variability .",
    "however , we can use the short - term results to set an expectation on how often we might find such variability in the long - term sample , even if there is no true long - term variability .",
    "we can take all combinations of the short - term observations for a star and see how often we get a z - statistic greater than 2.0 or 3.0 .",
    "for @xmath28 gem , there are 120 possible pairs of observations that can be chosen , 14 ( 11.7% ) of which have z @xmath45 2.0 , including just 2 ( 1.7% ) with z @xmath45 3.0 .",
    "in contrast , for 18 boo there are 300 possible pairs of observations , 88 ( 29.3% ) of which have z @xmath45 2.0 , including 29 ( 9.7% ) with z @xmath45 3.0 . naturally , we can also note that if all stars are constant , we expect only 4.6% of a large sample to show z @xmath45 2.0 and 0.3% with z @xmath45 3.0 .",
    "our finding of only two out of eleven stars with possible long - term variability is thus most consistent with the minimal or non - existent short - term variability of @xmath28 gem .",
    "however , given the small sample size , this finding is also consistent with the other two possibilities .",
    "the key is that our results do not suggest significant excess long - term variability in the early f - type stars beyond that which can be explained by short - term variability , unless the long - term variability happens on very long time scales .",
    "if long - term variability were important on several year time scales , we might expect a large fraction of our long - term sample to show variations due to a combination of short - term and long - term variability and that appears not to be the case .",
    "however , we do not have enough information to support an explanation for why we do not see variability in more stars .",
    "given the long - term data for @xmath28 gem , the combination of bad luck and slightly poorer data quality may have conspired to hide more obvious short - term variability .",
    "in fact , we certainly can not rule out the possibility that all early f - type stars exhibit variability at a level that would be detected by a large number of observations at a precision comparable to our best data .",
    "it is worth noting that most stars in the long - term sample have average line strengths below that of the short - term sample , making it more difficult to detect activity variations at a given fractional level .",
    "as far as the activity levels themselves , it is clear from a variety of studies using numerous activity indicators that the early f - type stars exhibit a wide range in activity , even when considering a narrow temperature range .",
    "this is true for chromospheric emission lines such as @xmath21335 @xcite and lyman @xmath4 @xcite , and x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "results for the d@xmath0 line are similar @xcite .",
    "however , the results of these studies can rule out some mechanisms that might explain the range , such as luminosity class @xcite , age @xcite , and rotational velocity @xcite .",
    "an important motivation for the present study was to assess whether short - term and/or long - term variability can explain the large range in activity levels .",
    "this does not appear to be the case . among the most persuasive arguments to support this conclusion are the general lack of significant variability in the long - term sample , and the fact that @xmath38 leo seems to have consistently very low activity .",
    "stars such as @xmath16 ser and @xmath36 lep are near @xmath38 leo on the color - magnitude diagram and have very similar temperatures and gravities , but have d@xmath0 line strengths a factor of @xmath15 greater .",
    "thus , if variability is responsible for this difference , it must happen on time scales longer than a few years .",
    "furthermore , the general agreement we see between our measurements and those reported by other authors many years before and/or after also suggests that long - term variability is not a major factor .",
    "we have performed the most detailed study to date on chromospheric variability in the early f - type stars . through a combination of intensive observations of four stars over intervals of several days and occasional observations over a period of a few years for these stars plus an additional eleven stars ,",
    "we have searched for variations in the strength , wavelength , and width of the helium d@xmath0 line .",
    "key aspects of our study are the rigorous procedures used to eliminate contaminating telluric and photospheric lines from the chromospheric d@xmath0 line and our careful assessment of measurement uncertainties .",
    "we find significant evidence for short - term ( hours to days ) variability in two early f - type stars , amounting to about a factor of two in equivalent width .",
    "the central wavelength of the line also shows evidence for variability , but this variability covers a small fraction of the total range due to rotational broadening .",
    "our data do not support a simple explanation associated with pure rotational modulation of discrete active regions or active longitudes for the early f - type stars , but this explanation does appear to apply to the short - term variations seen in the two coolest stars , @xmath4 cmi and @xmath29 boo .    in a statistical sense , the small number of stars in the long - term sample showing possible variability is consistent with the idea that some small fraction of early f - type stars show short - term variability large enough to be detected at our measurement precision .",
    "however , the long - term sample does not point to the likelihood of variability on the scale of years in the early f - type stars beyond that which can be explained by short - term variability .    finally , the general lack of variability larger than a factor of two implies that variability is not an explanation for the large range in activity levels seen in the early f - type stars and this range remains unexplained .",
    "we thank the referee for very helpful comments on the manuscript .",
    "we would also like to thank darrel smith for his careful reading of the manuscript and andri gretarsson for discussions concerning statistical analysis .",

    "<S> using precise measurements of the helium d@xmath0 line , we have searched for statistically significant variations in the strength of chromospheric activity in 13 early f - type stars and two late f - type stars . in two early f - type stars , </S>",
    "<S> we find short - term ( hours to days ) variability based on @xmath125 observations over the course of a week . in an additional two cases we find significant differences between observations taken years apart , but we can most likely explain this apparent long - term variation as an artifact of probable short - term variations . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence suggests that pure rotational modulation of discrete active regions is not responsible for the short - term variations in the early f - type stars and that either a more global process is at work , or we are seeing large number of small active regions spread across the star . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the two late f - type stars in the sample show strength and/or wavelength variations that are consistent with `` solar - type '' activity typified by the rotational modulation of active regions . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that variability does not cause the wide range in activity levels observed within the early f - type stars . </S>"
