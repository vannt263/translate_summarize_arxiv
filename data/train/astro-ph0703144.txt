    "a standard model for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been the fireball model @xcite . in this scenario , it is assumed that by whatever a process , a radiation - dominated , optically thick , and baryon - poor plasma fluid is suddenly produced in a compact volume .",
    "the radiation field drives the fireball into relativistic expansion , so that a significant fraction of the initial energy of the radiation is converted to the kinetic energy of the fireball @xcite . at the end of acceleration ,",
    "the fireball starts to expand freely with a constant lorentz factor @xmath0 ( kobayashi , piran & sari 1999 ) .",
    "later on , the fireball becomes optically thin and the thermal radiation trapped originally in the fireball starts to leak out .",
    "as the fireball becomes sufficiently large , its kinetic energy is converted to the prompt gamma - ray emission through the internal shock and the afterglow emission through the external shock @xcite . for a review on the fireball model and the internal / external shocks ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in many ways",
    "a grb fireball is like a cosmological big bang @xcite .",
    "both theories assume that the event ( the grb and the universe ) starts with a state of a radiation - dominated plasma of very high temperature , in which the production of electron - positron pairs is important , and the plasma is optically thick . the energy of the radiation drives the expansion of the plasma .",
    "the plasma and the radiation cool down as the fireball expands . at some moment , the mass density of the plasma becomes low enough so that the plasma becomes optically thin to the photons trapped in it , and the fireball ( of the grb or of the universe ) undergoes a transition from an opaque phase to a transparent phase .",
    "however , a grb fireball also differs from the big bang .",
    "the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at a very high degree . at the time of recombination the fluctuation in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation relative to the mean",
    "temperature is only @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the grb fireball could be highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic .",
    "indeed , the fluctuation in the lorentz factor of the fireball is required for the internal shock model to work @xcite .",
    "the universe is a closed system so that the total energy in it must be conserved .",
    "however , the grb fireball interacts with the surrounding matter and photons are radiated away from its surface .",
    "the central engine of the grb may also continue pumping energy into the fireball even after the prompt grb emission has ended ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , it is usually assumed that the universe is infinite , but of course the grb fireball has a finite volume .",
    "a remarkable success of the big bang theory has been the prediction of the existence of a blackbody cmb of temperature @xmath2  k in today s universe @xcite and its detection @xcite .",
    "the cmb is in fact the cooled remnant of the primeval fireball  an echo of the big bang . because of the expansion of the universe",
    ", the temperature of the cmb is redshifted and is hence very low as the cmb photons reach an observer of today .",
    "similarly , we expect that the grb fireball has also a remnant of the radiation initially trapped in the fireball , and that the remnant would have a quasi - thermal spectrum . however , because of the fact that the surface of the fireball is assumed to be moving relativistically towards an observer who detects the grb , the temperature of the radiation as measured by the observer would be significantly boosted by the doppler effect .    because of the fact that the radiation in the fireball has a finite energy , the remnant event must have a finite duration .",
    "the event starts when the fireball is still optically thick , while the main burst takes place when the fireball is already optically thin .",
    "hence , the remnant event must occur before the main burst , with a smaller distance from the grb central engine than the main burst . as we will see",
    ", the remnant event often has a shorter duration than the main burst ( due to the remnant event s smaller distance from the central engine ) , and is separated from the main burst by a quiescent period of time .",
    "since it is produced by the emission from the photosphere of the fireball , the remnant event should have a spectrum that is dominated by a quasi - thermal component .",
    "hence , at least in a high energy band , the remnant event should look weaker than the main burst . therefore",
    ", the remnant event should be observed as a _ precursor _ of the grb .",
    "the aim of the paper is to quantitatively investigate the properties of the grb precursors as the remnant of the radiation initially trapped in the fireball and look for their possible observational consequences .    in at least several cases , precursors of grbs",
    "have been unambiguously detected .",
    "grb 030406 , a burst that was detected out side of the field of view of the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( ) , had a precursor that occurred @xmath3  s before the main burst @xcite .",
    "grb 041219a , a burst that was detected by the burst alert system ( ibas ) , had a precursor that occurred @xmath4  s before the main burst @xcite .",
    "grb 050820a triggered the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard by a precursor , and by the main burst .",
    "the precursor occurred @xmath5  s before the main burst , and the entire duration of the burst is @xmath6  s @xcite .",
    "grb 060124 , also detected by both bat/ and , had a precursor that occurred @xmath7  s before the main burst @xcite .",
    "the entire duration is @xmath8  s , making grb 060124 one of the longest bursts .",
    "another interesting case is grb 061121 , detected by bat/ ( also by and _ rhessi _ ) , which had a precursor that occurred @xmath9  s before the main burst @xcite .",
    "these observed gamma - ray precursors have the following characters : ( 1 ) the precursor is separated from the main burst by a long period of quiescent time ; the time separation is comparable to the duration of the main burst .",
    "( 2 ) the precursor is weaker than the main burst , and has a shorter time - duration .",
    "( 3 ) the precursor often has a smooth and fred ( fast rise and exponential decay ) shape lightcurve .",
    "( grb 050820a is an exception , whose precursor has a lightcurve with at least two peaks . )",
    "( 4 ) the precursor has a much softer spectrum than the main burst , and in at least two cases ( grb 030406 and grb 041219a ) the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody or a blackbody plus a power - law .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have found that about 3 percent of the grbs detected by the burst and transient spectrometer experiment ( batse ) on the compton gamma - ray observatory ( ) have precursors . with a precursor definition different from that of @xcite",
    ", @xcite has found that about 20 percent of the long - duration batse grbs have evidence of precursor emission .",
    "soft precursor activities in x - rays have been detected in a number of grbs by _ ginga _ @xcite and watch onboard _",
    "the precursors detected by _",
    "ginga _ have a thermal spectrum with a temperature @xmath10@xmath11 kev .    on the thermal emission in grbs",
    ", we would also mention that @xcite has found that up to 30 percent of long - duration grbs detected by batse/ have a spectrum that can be interpreted as combination of a thermal peak plus a power - law component .",
    "but his results refer to the prompt gamma - ray emission in the main burst , not the precursor emission .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a very simple model for the grb fireball . by assumption ,",
    "the fireball is homogeneous and spherically symmetric , and expands with a constant and relativistic speed .",
    "the fireball contains a thermal radiation field , but the energy density of the radiation is not large enough to affect the dynamics of the fireball . the rest mass and the kinetic energy of the fireball are conserved . for the radiation field in the fireball ,",
    "the change in the number of photons is caused only by the emission from the photosphere .",
    "hence , the number of photons is an adiabatically conserved quantity .",
    "the last condition requires that the electron - positron pairs have already annihilated .",
    "thus , in addition , we assume that the opacity in the fireball is given by the constant thompson opacity .",
    "our model corresponds to the post - acceleration phase of the grb outflow .",
    "this assumption is justified by the fact that the radius of the fireball at the time of photosphere emission is much larger than the radius at the end of acceleration ( * ? ? ? * and section [ char ] in the present paper ) .",
    "our model is similar to that of @xcite in several aspects : both models assume a freely expanding and optically thick fireball in which an amount of energy was generated instantly at a beginning time , and the observable event is determined by the evolution of the fireball and the radiation in it .",
    "there is no continuous injection of energy or mass , unlike the steady wind model of @xcite .",
    "however , our model also differs from that of @xcite . in the model of @xcite",
    ", the fireball is very hot and the process of pair production is very important , and the photosphere was not explicitly included in the calculation .",
    "while in our model , the fireball is relatively cool and hence the process of pair production can be ignored ( see section [ char ] for a justification of this assumption ) , and the photosphere is calculated in details .",
    "in addition , the model of @xcite [ as well as that of @xcite ] was aimed to interpret the prompt emission of grbs ( the main bursts ) , while our model is aimed to interpret the precursor emission of grbs .",
    "this leads to a cooler fireball since a grb precursor usually has a spectrum that is softer than the main burst .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ milne ] , we describe the geometry and the kinematics of a grb fireball , the kinematics of a radiation field in it , and the structure of the photosphere . in section",
    "[ precursor ] , we describe a formalism for calculating the properties of the precursor event of a grb arising from the emission by the photosphere , including the luminosity , the blackbody spectrum , and the photon rate observed by a remote observer . in section [ numer ] , we present our numerical results . in section [ char ] ,",
    "we derive some scaling relations for the characteristic quantities of the precursor , including the characteristic time scale , the characteristic total energy , and the characteristic photon energy .",
    "we also give brief justification for some key assumptions in our model . in section [ discussion ] , we discuss the effect of jet collimation , the dependence of our results on the energy band of the detector , and the effect of spectrum distortion by electron scattering . in section [ concl ] , we summarize the results and draw our conclusions .    in appendix",
    "[ const_vel ] , we present the simplified results for a limiting case : a photosphere with a constant expansion velocity , which applies to the beginning part of the precursor .",
    "we remark that thermal precursors of grbs in the internal shock model have been previously studied by @xcite .",
    "the thermal emission from a grb photosphere and its effect on the prompt spectrum of a grb have been investigated by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; peer , mszros & rees ( 2006 ) ; @xcite ; and thompson , mszros & rees ( 2007 ) . the emission from a photosphere of a poynting flux dominated magnetized fireball and its relation to the grb precursor or",
    "the prompt emission of the main burst has been discussed by @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "our model differs from that adopted in their papers . in their work",
    ", they have assumed a steady wind model for the fireball , in which mass and energy are continuously injected into the wind at the center . and",
    ", the expansion of the fireball in our model was driven by radiation , not by the poynting flux as in the magnetic models .",
    "bianco , ruffini & xue ( 2001 ) have calculated the thermal emission from a fireball dominated by electron - positron pairs arising from the quantum vacuum polarization process around a charged black hole .",
    "the results have been applied to interpretation of the precursor emission , the main burst , as well as the afterglow of grbs in a unified way @xcite .",
    "we also remark that thermal precursors produced by the shock wave ( or jet ) breakout of the progenitor star in the collapsar model of grbs have been studied by macfadyen & woosley ( 1999 ) ; macfadyen , woosley & heger ( 2001 ) ; ramirez - ruiz , macfadyen & lazzati ( 2002 ) ; and waxman & mszros ( 2003 ) .    finally , whenever an observer is referred to in the paper , we ignore the cosmological effect .",
    "that is , we assume that the universe is euclidean . the correction of the cosmological effect is straightforward , which mainly includes three factors : cosmological redshift to the observed photon energy , time dilation in the observed lightcurve duration , and that the grb distance appearing in our formulae should be interpreted as the appropriate cosmological distance .",
    "a freely expanding , homogeneous , and spherically symmetric fireball is like a milne universe ( see , e.g. , rindler 1977 ) , except that a fireball has a finite volume but the milne universe has an infinite volume .    let us denote the time in the grb s rest frame by @xmath12 , and the spherical coordinates in it by @xmath13 .",

    "equation ( [ r_t ] ) demonstrates that , at any moment of constant @xmath12 , we have @xmath27 .",

    "the peak spectral energy given by equation ( [ epeak_es ] ) , which is defined in the observer s frame , appears to be in agreement with that of the precursors detected by gamma - ray detectors .",
    "another effect that may help shifting up the photon energy is that the blackbody emission from the photosphere may be nonthermalized by some scattering process and have a nonthermal spectrum . for example , @xcite has shown that the scattering of the adiabatically cooled thermal photons by the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence in the photosphere can boost the thermal photons up to a larger peak energy and lead to a spectrum that have a broken power - law or a band function @xcite shape .",
    "we have studied a simple model for the precursor event of a grb , where the precursor is produced by the emission from the early photosphere of a fireball .",
    "the fireball is assumed to be homogeneous , spherical , and expand freely and relativistically .",
    "the fireball contains a constant amount of rest mass , and has a constant total kinetic energy .",
    "it also contains a radiation field , which drives the acceleration of the fireball expansion at the very early stage , but simply cools down with the expansion at the late free expansion stage .",
    "these assumptions make our model different from that has been adopted in the literature for studying the photosphere emission of a grb , which usually assumes a steady wind with mass and energy injection at the center @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the fireball is the same as that of a milne universe , except that the fireball has a finite size and contains a finite amount of mass and energy . in the same way as the universe ,",
    "at very early time the fireball is opaque to the photons contained in it , but later it becomes transparent ( fig .",
    "[ fireball ] ) .",
    "the photosphere is defined to be the hypersurface where the total optical depth is unity . if the fireball had an infinitely large radius , then as in the milne universe , the photosphere were just a spacelike hyperbola .",
    "however , because of the fact that the fireball has a finite radius , the hypersurface of the photosphere is timelike when @xmath468 .",
    "it is the emission from this timelike part that makes the dominant contribution to the precursor emission detected by a remote observer , since this timelike surface moves towards the observer with a relativistic speed .",
    "however , the spacelike part of the photosphere produces a long tail of soft emission .",
    "the luminosity , the photon rate ( the lightcurve ) , and the blackbody spectrum of the precursor are calculated .",
    "the results are presented in figs .",
    "[ luminosity][spectrum_int ] . a remarkable feature of the results is that , when the quantities are properly scaled and the time is not too large , the results are almost invariant with respect to the lorentz factor of the fireball .",
    "that is , if the observer time is in units of @xmath469 ( eq .  [ t0 ] ) , the luminosity is in units of @xmath287 ( eq .",

    "thus , a critical time scale for the precursor is @xmath273 ( eqs .",
    "[ t0 ] and [ t0_num ] ) , which is @xmath472  s for typical parameters .",
    "the luminosity starts with a constant @xmath473 , and drops to @xmath474 at @xmath475 .",
    "the total energy emitted by the photosphere is @xmath476 .",

    "the characteristic time is shorter than the duration of a typical long grb ( the main burst ) , and the characteristic photon energy is in the x - ray band .",
    "because of the thermal nature of the spectrum , at least in the high energy band the total energy is expected to be smaller than the main burst .",
    "a constraint on these three characteristic quantities is given by equation ( [ eph_max ] ) , which does not depend on the value of the opacity in the fireball .",

    "the time separation between the precursor and the main burst is then @xmath493 .",

    "this relation between the duration of the main burst and the time separation between the main burst and the precursor appears to be consistent with the observation ( see introduction ) .",
    "we have assumed a spherical fireball . if the grb outflow is collimated and the resulted fireball has a configuration of a cone spanning a solid angle @xmath500 that satisfies @xmath501 , the results are still valid until a time is reached when the flux - averaged polar angle of the photosphere increases to a value @xmath502 ( fig .",
    "[ lum_gamma ] ) .",
    "however , in the results , @xmath270 and @xmath266 should be interpreted as the isotropic - equivalent luminosity and the isotropic - equivalent photon rate respectively .",
    "equations ( [ lam0])([rc0 ] ) still hold , but @xmath60 and @xmath356 should be interpreted as the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy and the isotropic - equivalent characteristic total energy of radiation , respectively . this fact is caused by the relativistic beaming effect , which implies that when the photosphere expands relativistically the dominant contribution to the spectrum and the luminosity observed by a remote observer comes from a small region on the photosphere that spans a solid angle @xmath503 .",
    "the dependence of the observed lightcurve and spectrum on the finite energy range of a detector has also been discussed ( sec .",
    "[ detector ] ) .",
    "overall , as the lower limit of the detector energy increases , the duration of the lightcurve decreases and the maximum of the lightcurve shifts to earlier time ( figs .  [ lightcurve2 ] and [ lightcurve2_peak ] ) .",
    "the peak photon energy of the spectrum increases with the lower energy bound of the detector ( fig .",
    "[ lightcurve2_peak ] ) .",
    "the photon energy predicted by our simple model seems to be consistent with the x - ray precursors of grbs detected by _ ginga _ and watch/_granat _ @xcite , but is too small for the precursors detected by gamma - ray detectors @xcite .",
    "however , in our model we have assumed that the emission from the photosphere has a spectrum that is perfectly blackbody . when electron scattering dominates the opacity , the blackbody spectrum is distorted @xcite .",
    "we have estimated this effect by adopting a modified flux equation in equation ( [ qq ] ) and found that the distorted spectrum could have a peak spectral energy of @xmath4 kev , which is consistent with the hard spectrum of the observed gamma - ray precursors ( sec .",
    "[ distortion ] ) .",
    "scattering of the soft blackbody photons by e.g. the magnetic turbulence in the fireball may also lead to a nonthermal spectrum @xcite . a detailed study on these issues",
    "is left for our future work .",
    "a strong assumption in our model is that there is no continuous injection of energy and mass , and hence the total mass and the kinetic energy of the fireball are conserved .",
    "a big benefit from this simplified assumption is that the shape of the lightcurve and the duration of the emission can be predicted , in contrast to the steady wind model where the lightcurve and the duration depend on the rate of energy and mass injection as a function of time . on the physics side , this type of models with ` instant release of energy ' may be relevant to the precursors that have smooth and fred shape lightcurves .",
    "more complicated models with continuous injection of mass and energy may be relevant to the precursors that have complex lightcurves .    although the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on has discovered that flares are common in early x - ray afterglows of grbs and it seems that the most likely cause of the flares is the late - time activity of the grb central engine ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ,",
    "the time separation between two adjacent flares are usually much longer than the duration of the precursor event predicted by our model and hence the assumption of no continuous energy and mass injection remains valid .",
    "of course the fireballs or expanding shells related to the late - time activity would also have photosphere emissions .",
    "however , the late - time photosphere emissions would overlap with the prompt main grb emissions or the afterglows @xcite and hence are hard to detect [ see , however , @xcite ; and @xcite ] .    in summary ,",
    "our model implies the existence of a quasi - thermal precursor of a grb . the precursor is a remnant of the thermal radiation contained in the fireball during its initial acceleration phase , just like that the cmb is a remnant of the radiation in the big bang .",
    "the precursor emission has a quasi - thermal spectrum , and a smooth and fred shape lightcurve with a duration @xmath10@xmath439  s. if the distortion of the blackbody spectrum by the electron scattering process is not important , the radiation observed by a remote observer is in the x - ray band with a peak photon energy @xmath10@xmath440  kev .",
    "if the distortion by electron scattering is important , the peak photon energy could be of several hundred kev and hence be in the gamma - ray band . under some conditions the soft thermal photons may also be nonthermalized and have a nonthermal spectrum .",
    "although in reality the situation may be much more complicated , our simple model may provide a reasonable interpretation for at least a class of grb precursors  those having smooth and fred - shape lightcurves and quasi - thermal spectra .",
