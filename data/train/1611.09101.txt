    "recent papers by dalton et al @xcite , @xcite , dalton16b have dealt with the topic of bipartite quantum entanglement and experimental tests for demonstrating it in the context of systems of identical massive bosons",
    ". however , although the quantum states of composite systems can just be classified into disjoint sets of separable or entangled states , it is also possible to classify them into distinct categories based on local hidden variable theory @xcite , where the two basic disjoint sub - sets of quantum states are the bell local states and the bell non -local states .",
    "based on the work of wiseman et al @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the bell local states can then be divided into three disjoint sub - categories .",
    "the four categories of states associated with local hidden variable theory have differing features regarding entanglement , epr steering and bell non - locality - as will be explained below .",
    "this paper is aimed at developing tests based on experimentally measureable quantities for demonstrating which category applies for quantum states of bipartite composite systems of identical massive bosons .",
    "the local hidden variable theory treatment has origins in papers by einstein , schrodinger , bell and werner ( @xcite , schrodinger35a , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "einstein suggested that quantum theory , though correct was incomplete - in that it did not deal satisfactorily with the issue of whether the possible measured outcomes for observable quantities ( such as position and momentum ) could be regarded as elements of reality irrespective of whether an actual measurement has taken place .",
    "this issue was raised in the context of entangled states such as for the epr  paradox , in which the entangled state for two well - separated and no longer interacting sub - systems had well - defined values for the position difference and the momentum sum . here",
    "the choice of measuring the position or momentum for one sub - system would instantantly determine affect the outcome for measuring position or momentum of the other sub - system - a feature we now refer to as steering - but which einstein called `` spooky action at a distance '' and regarded as being in conflict with causality the schrodinger cat paradox @xcite is another example .",
    "bohm @xcite described a similar paradox to epr , but now involving a system consisting of two spin @xmath12 particles in a singlet state , and where observables with quantised measured outcomes were now involved .",
    "einstein suggested that quantum theory could be the statistical outcome of a more deterministic underlying theory - essentially what we now refer to as a hidden variable theory - where in its simplest form the possible measured outcomes for all observables always have specific values , and measurement merely revealed what these values are .",
    "this is in direct contradiction to the copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory , in which the values for observables do not have a presence in reality until measurement takes place .",
    "however , it was not until 1965 before a quantitative general form for hidden variable theory which could be tested in experiments was proposed by bell @xcite . basically , the key idea is that hidden variables are determined probabilistically when the state for the composite system is prepared and these would determine the values for all the sub - system observables even after the sub - systems have separated - and even if the observables were incompatible ( such as two different spin components ) .",
    "quantum states for composite systems that could be described by hidden variable theory ( the bell local states ) were such that certain inequalities would apply involving the mean values of products for the results of measuring pairs of observables for both sub - systems - the bell inequalities @xcite , @xcite . based on the entangled singlet state of two spin @xmath12 particles",
    "clauser et al @xcite proposed an experiment that could demonstrate a violation of a bell inequality .",
    "this would show that hidden variable theory could not account for experiments that can be explained by quantum theory . in more elaborate versions of hidden variable theory ( see @xcite for a description )",
    ", the hidden variables would merely determine the probabilities of measurement outcomes for each of the sub - systems , whilst the overall expressions for the joint sub - system measurement outcomes are still obtained via classical probability theory .",
    "bell inequalities of the same form still apply in this more elaborate version of hidden variable theory .",
    "subsequent experimental work violating bell inequalities confirmed that there are some quantum states for which a hidden variable theory does not apply and where quantum theory was needed to explain the results ( see brunner et al @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "states for which a hidden variable theory does not apply ( and hence violate bell inequalities ) are the bell non - local states .",
    "it was recognised @xcite that all separable states could be described by hidden variable theory ( and hence are bell local ) and hence a state had to be entangled to be bell non - local .",
    "however , werner @xcite showed that some entangled states could also be described by hidden variable theory - and hence not violate a bell inequality .",
    "the relationship between the classification of states into separable or entangled on one hand , and a classification into bell local and bell non - local states on the other hand is therefore not a simple one .",
    "in addition to bell locality or non  locality , there is the question of which categories of states demonstrate the feature of steering @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , in which a choice of measurement on one sub - system can be used to instantly affect the outcomes for possible measurements on the other sub - system - even if it they are well separated .",
    "as we will see , steerability requires the absence of the so - called local hidden states - which are sub - system quantum states whose density operator is specified by the hidden variables .    in the work by wiseman et al , @xcite , @xcite , cavalcanti09a states for bipartite systems defined in terms of local hidden variable theory",
    "were first categorised by whether they are bell local or bell non - local . within the states that are bell local a more detailed categorisation was made based on a hierarchy of non - disjoint sub - sets - firstly by whether they are epr steerable or not , and then secondly for epr non - steerable states by whether they are separable or not .",
    "in the present paper we find it convenient to categorise the bell local states into three sub - sets which are disjoint , but which are still related to the heirarchy of non - disjoint sub - sets introduced by wiseman et al .",
    "the disjoint sub - sets of states are defined by whether two , one or none of the sub - system hidden variable probabilities is associated with a local hidden quantum state determined from the hidden variables .",
    "category 1 states involve two hidden states , and this bell local sub - set is the same as the separable states - which are non - steerable .",
    "category 2 states involve only one hidden state and for this bell local sub - set the states are entangled but non - steerable .",
    "category 3 states do not involve any hidden state , and these bell local states are both entangled and steerable .",
    "we will also designate the states that are bell non - local as category 4 states , and these states are both entangled and steerable .",
    "it is of some interest to devise tests for which specific category a quantum state falls into .",
    "the main focus of this paper is on whether the quantum state is steerable - which means showing that it is not in category 1 or category 2 . in previous work tests",
    "have been obtained ( see @xcite for details of a range of tests found by various authors ) for showing that a state is entangled , which therefore rules them out from being in category 1 . hence we only need to consider tests for showing that the state is also not in category 2 .",
    "a second focus of this paper is to devise a test for bell non - locality that can be applied when the measurable quantities for the two sub - systems have a range of outcomes other than the more limited @xmath13 outcomes considered by clauser et al @xcite .",
    "we begin with a brief review of measurement probabilities in bipartite systems , focusing both on quantum expressions for joint measurenment probabilities and local hidden variable theory expressions .",
    "we then consider the detailed description of how the quantum states for composite systems may be categorised .",
    "we relate our categories of states to the heirarchy of sub - sets discussed in refs.@xcite , @xcite , cavalcanti09a , @xcite , and discuss the question of how to interconvert between quantum and local hidden variable theory quantities .",
    "the approach used for bipartite systems involves replacing annihilation and creation operators by quadrature amplitudes , including in expessions for spin operators .",
    "important relationships between the mean values for measurements given by quantum theory and by local hidden variable theory are highlighted .",
    "we then consider various tests for quantum entanglement , epr steering and bell non - locality , taking into account that the local hidden states must comply with the local particle number super - selection rule , since they must be possible quantum states for the particular sub - system considered on its own .",
    "tests for quantum entanglement ( bloch vector test , spin squeezing in any spin component @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 , hillery et al spin variance test , strong correlation test , a two mode quadrature squeezing test ) can also be applied as tests for epr steering .",
    "in addition , as well as a new strong correlation test , a further test for epr steering involving the sum of the variances for spin operators @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the mean boson number is obtained following an approach in cavalcanti et al cavalcanti11a and he et al @xcite . this test is a stronger version of the hillery spin variance test and also involves the mean value for @xmath17 .",
    "finally , a test for bell non - locality is then found for the situation where sub - system spin operators are measured , generalising the result in clauser et al @xcite to the sutaution where the measured outcomes are not restricted to @xmath18 .",
    "the bell inequality now involves the mean boson numbers @xmath19 for the sub - systems .    in the appendices we discuss quantum features that underlying hidden variable theories need to explain , the physical issues behind epr steering , and some general features of mean values and variances .",
    "the werner states are also described , since in various parameter regimes they provide examples of the four categories of states in the local hidden variable theory model .",
    "the idea behind epr steering is discussed in an appendix and details for the derivation of an epr steering test presented in another . in a further appendix",
    "we examine the possibility of an epr steering test based on the difference between the variances of the number difference and number sum .",
    "this paper deals with measurements on _ bipartitite _ composite quantum systems , where we have two _ distinguishable _ sub - systems @xmath9 and @xmath11 which are each associated with measureable physical",

    "probabilities _ rather than being _ deterministic _ , and",

    "as noted in the introduction , hidden variable theories were based on einstein s hypothesis that although quantum theory is _ correct _ , it was _ incomplete _ in that it could be underpinned by an underlying _ classical _ deterministic theory that described the true _",
    "_  reality _ _ and which was built on _",
    "hidden variables_. such an approach has been described above in the context of providing an alternative theory of the _ joint probabilities _ for the _ _  outcomes _ _ of measurements of pairs of _ observables _ on _ separate sub - systems _ of a _",
    "composite _ quantum system .",
    "this aspect of hidden variable theory focused on the _ key quantum _",
    "_ features _ of measurement outcomes being governed by _",
    "probabilities _ in general , and the unusual features of these probabilities associated with _",
    "entanglement _ and _ bell non - locality _ for composite quantum systems .    basing the two categories 2 and 3 on lhv  theories in which one or two of the sub - system measurement probabilities @xmath157 and @xmath83 for particular preparation processes are _",
    "not _ determinable via any well - defined theory that actually can be used to _ derive _ the probability expressions from the evolution of the hidden variables associated with a _ known _ initial state to those associated with the _ prepared",
    "_ state may seem a rather questionable approach from the general scientific methodology point of view .",
    "however , the point of view involved is based on seeing if _ any _ lhv theory can account for the measurement outcomes _ irrespective _ of whether a _",
    "consistent _ and _ complete _ lhv dynamical theory is actually _",
    "available_. the aim is to see if all lhv can be ruled out , which then would make it _ unnecessary _ to try to develop a fully predictive version .",
    "in contrast with all local hidden variable theories , quantum theory _ does _ provide an actual consistent and complete dynamical theory both for determining the density operator @xmath65 associated with a given preparation process , and for calculating the measurement probabilities via ( [ eq.quantumjointprob ] ) and ( [ eq.quantumsingleprob ] ) .",
    "as previously noted , einstein et al @xcite did not doubt the _ correctness _ of such quantum predictions , but rather asked the question whether the joint measurement probabilities could be accounted for by some sort of _ underlying _ realistic theory - such as the local hidden variable theories considered here .",
    "although the possible bell inequality violations are important situations for consideration regarding whether hidden variable theories are compatible with quantum theory , we wish to point out that there is actually _ more _ than just one key feature of quantum theory that a hidden variable theory would need to account for .",
    "the hidden variable theory approach is even _",
    "harder _ to implement than just dealing with bell localilty .",
    "as we will see , several of these features are _ difficult _ to account for via a hidden variable theory .",
    "we begin by listing a number of _ key features _ of quantum theory .",
    "_ probabilities for measurement outcomes_. outcomes only predictable probabilistically , in contrast to deterministic outcomes in classical theory .",
    "born s rules based on square of probabilty amplitudes .",
    "classically forbidden events ( quantum tunneling ) may occur that are forbidden in classical physics .",
    "_ quantum superposition_. states can occur that are superpositions of other states leading to superposition of probability amplitudes .",
    "quantum constructive and destructive interference effects in outcome probability amplitudes .",
    "_ quantum entanglement_. feature may occur in certain states for composite quantum systems .",
    "effects such as violations of bell inequalities .",
    "schrodinger cat paradox .",
    "_ quantisation_. the possible measured outcomes for certain physical observables only take on certain discrete vaules , with values in between never occuring .",
    "often the quantised outcomes depend on planck s constant , which does not appear in classical theories .",
    "quantum numbers often related to irreducible representations of a symmetry group .",
    "lack of _ simultaneous measurement _ outcomes .",
    "certain pairs of physical observables are such that carrying out a precise measurement for one leads to imprecise measurement outcomes for the other , as exhibited via heisenberg uncertainty principle inequalities for the variances of the measurements - again often involving planck s constant .",
    "_ wave - particle duality_. a quantum system sometimes behaves like a classical particle , sometimes like a classical wave - but never both in the same experiment .",
    "related to heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "_ non - classical _ physical quantities .",
    "new physical quantities occur which are absent from classical theories ( parity , spin angular momentum , .. ) .",
    "often these quantities are relate to symmetries of the system .",
    "\\8 . _ symmetrisation principles _ for _ identical particles_. the quantum state can at most change sign when identical particles are interchanged .",
    "related to permutation symmetry and seen in phenomena such as the periodic table and bose - einstein condensation .    \\9 .",
    "_ creation _ and _ destruction _ of matter .",
    "the basic particles do not always have a permanent existence when the relativistic regime of quantum theory is involved , unlike in classical theory .",
    "associated with quantum theory of fields .",
    "dynamical _ evolution _ of _ quantum states_. states evolve in accordance with non - classical equations , such as liouville - von neumann equation .",
    "involves planck s constant and is first order in time in contrast to classical equations such as newton s law , which is second order in time .",
    "_ conservation laws_. measurement outcome probabilities for certain physical quantities may not change during state evolution . related to symmetry of system hamiltonian .",

    "strong _ link between the key features of quantum theory and the _ mathematical structure _ that is applied in quantum theory . representing pure _ quantum states _ by vectors in a _",
    "hilbert space _ leads naturally to the _ quantum superposition _ feature .",
    "_ tensor products _ of hilbert spaces being used for composite quantum systems is closely linked to _ quantum entanglement _ and the _ symmetrisation _ principle . representing _ physical quantities _ by _ linear hermitian operators",
    "_ is linked to the possible measured outcomes being associated with one of the main characteristics of such operators - the spectrum of__real eigenvalues__. in addition such sets of eigenvalues often exhibit the _ quantisation _ effects associated with the outcomes of measurements in quantum theory . representing physical quantities by operators also faciltates the presence of _ non - classical _ physical quantities as new linear hermitian operators for the syatem are identified . _",
    "symmetry properties _ are linked to the presence of groups of _ unitary operators _ and _ conserved physical quantities _ are associated with the _ generators _ of these operator _ groups_. the lack of _ simultaneous measureability _ of certain pairs of physical quantities",
    "is related to the absence of _ simultaneous eigenvectors _ for _ non - commuting operators_. finally , the _ measurement probabilities _ can be expressed in terms of mathematical processes in the hilbert space that involve the vectors representing the quantum states and the _ projector operators _ associated with the eigenvalues and _ eigenvectors _ of the operator representing the observable quantity .",
    "in contrast , the link between the mathematical structures generally used in trying to formulate an underlying hidden variable theory that could account for all these quantum features is rather _ weak_.",
    "this is often essentially the same as that used in classical physics involving _ time dependent functions _ or _ fields _ to represent the _ classical state _",
    ", with _ physical quantities _ introduced as _",
    "mathematical operations _ on these _ functions _ - such as the velocity being the time derivative of the function specifying position .",
    "although no one can categorically rule out hidden variable theories as being incapable of accounting even for most of the above quantum features ( the violation of bell inequalities is not regarded as being compatible with hidden variable theory ) , it does at least seem to be the case that the task would be a very difficult one - probably requiring the introduction of a _ novel _ mathematical structure to describe such a theory .",
    "to _ highlight _ some of the _ issues _ : - how would quantisation appear from the theory ? how would symmetrisation effects based on indistinguishable particles be accounted for when hidden variable theories are supposed to enable such particles to be distinguished by their differing trajectories ? where does planck s constant come from ?    given the flexibility in the range of possible hidden variable theories it is possible to generate _ some _ of these _ quantum features _ by just requiring the hvt to be subject to certain _",
    "constraints_. for example , quantisation of an angular momentum component @xmath556 could be achiweved by requiring @xmath557 tobe zero unless the outcome @xmath558 is an integer or half integer times @xmath559 .",
    "this would be rather _ ad _ _ hoc_. however , of all the quantum features the one that has rightly been identified as the key feature which rules out hvt is the _ violation _ of a _",
    "bell inequality_. these inequalities are constructed in terms of the most general unconstrained form of local hvt , so their violation must rule out a hvt interpretation .",
    "in this appendix we consider for reasons of completeness the physical idea behind epr steering , as presented in the papers @xcite , jones07a and @xcite .",
    "we can derive expressions within lhv theory for the _ conditional probabilities _ defined in ( [ eq.lhvtconditionalprob ] ) .",
    "these expressions apply for all three bell local categories considered here .",
    "we will focus on lhs states , which in terms of our lhvcs may be either in category 1 or category 2 .",
    "we will initially consider the latter .    in the case of _ category 2 _ states ( which are _ lhs states _ ) we obtain from ( [ eq.categorytwostates ] ) and ( [ eq.lhvtconditionalprob ] ) * *  * * @xmath560using ( [ eq.lhvtsingleprob ] ) and ( [ eq.singleproblhvquantumsubsys ] ) .",
    "it is also important to realise that these lhs model states are still related to an overall quantum state , but one which is _ non - separable _ since we can not derive the density operator ( [ eq.quantsepstate ] )  for separable states from category 2 expression ( [ eq.categorytwostates ] ) for the joint probability . for category 2 lhs states , @xmath82 is _ not _ given by a quantum expression . however , as in @xcite , @xcite we can relate the quantities in the lhs model ( [ eq.categorytwostates ] ) to a density operator for sub - system @xmath561 that is _ conditional _ on the results for measurements on sub - system @xmath562 .    from ( [ eq.quantumsingleprob ] ) the _ quantum theory _",

    "this strange quantum effect allows for an experiment carried out on sub - system @xmath9 to instantly change ( or `` _ _ steer _ _ '' ) the quantum state for sub - system @xmath11 into a new quantum state , even when the two sub - systems are localised in well - separated spatial regions and the experimenter on @xmath9 may have no direct access to sub - system @xmath11 . for those who accept the copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory",
    "there is nothing really strange involved .",
    "quantum states merely specify all that can be known about the physical state ( and no distinction between `` physical state '' and `` quantum state '' is made ) , so as the measurement of @xmath25 has led to a particular outcome @xmath22 our knowledge about the state has changed , and hence the quantum state for both the overall system and its sub - systems should change accordingly . using quantum theory",
    "we can obtain an explicit formula for @xmath574 and this is@xmath575where the original density operator @xmath570 is expressed in terms of orthonormal basis states @xmath576 that are eigenstates for @xmath577 and @xmath52 , with @xmath578 and @xmath579 allowing for degeneracy .",
    "we can also show that the sum of the conditional density operators @xmath580 each weighted by the probability @xmath581 for the measurement outcome @xmath28 for @xmath25 gives the reduced density operator @xmath582 associated with the original state @xmath570 .",
    "this result is not surprising , since carrying out the measurement of any choice of @xmath25 and then discarding the results would be described by reduced density operator . * *  * * @xmath583the proofs of ( [ eq.conddensoprsubb ] ) and ( eq.weightedsumconddensoprb ) are straightforward .",
    "thus , we have seen how according to quantum theory the quantum state describing sub - system @xmath11 changes as a result of measuring @xmath25 on sub - system @xmath9  and obtaining outcome @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , we have obtained quantum theory expressions ( [ eq.condprob ] ) for the conditional probability @xmath584 for measurement of @xmath26 on sub - system @xmath11  and obtaining outcome @xmath23 when measurement of @xmath25 on sub - system @xmath9 resulted in outcome @xmath22 and ( [ eq.conddensoprsubb ] ) for the quantum state describing sub - system @xmath585 .",
    "the question then is : although quantum theory gives the correct results for the conditional probability @xmath584 , can the same results _ also _ be explained in a local hidden variable theory ?    following the operational definition for steering in refs .",

    "we then see from ( eq.quantumsingleprob ) that for _ this state _ the probability for measurement of @xmath587to have outcome @xmath23 is given by @xmath592which is the same as ( [ eq.condproblhsstates ] ) obtained for the category 2 states ( which are lhs states ) .",
    "thus the sub - system @xmath11 quantum state ( eq.condquantstatelhsmodel ) has been constructed purely from the category 2 lhs  model probabilities @xmath91and @xmath593 - which is a possible quantum state for sub - system @xmath11 based on hidden variables @xmath6 .",
    "the sub - system @xmath11 quantum state @xmath590 in ( [ eq.condquantstatelhsmodel])determines the correct probability for measurement of @xmath587to have outcome @xmath23 .",
    "the same analysis would apply to the lhs states in category 1 , the only difference being that @xmath594 would be replaced by @xmath595 in terms of our notation .",

    "several difficult issues need to be dealt with .",
    "firstly , in a lhv the observables are basically considered as classical c - numbers , but given that the predictions from quantum theory are accepted as being correct these classical observables must correspond to underlying quantum hermitian operators - especially as in the lhs model where the probabilities @xmath677 for subsystem @xmath11 are also to be given by quantum formulae .",
    "also , there are several entanglement tests involving spin components , these are represented by the spin operators @xmath678 , @xmath212  and @xmath679  , where @xmath680  and @xmath285 are mode annihilation operators .",
    "the tests also involve the total number operator @xmath681 .",
    "all these operators are hermitian and represent observable quantities applying for the overall two mode system .",
    "we may also consider number operators for the two modal subsystems defined by @xmath682 and @xmath217 , which again are hermitian and represent observable quantities for each subsystem .",
    "the question then arises : how do you define the spin components and the boson number when the observables are supposed to be non - quantum ?",
    "@xmath683secondly , when considering entanglement tests involving spin components , both subsystem @xmath9 and @xmath11 involve mode annihilation operators - which are non - hermitian and not themselves associated with measurable observables . what meaning can we give to lhv probabilities @xmath82  and associated mean values @xmath684",
    "for subsystem @xmath9  when during the discussion of spin squeezing tests in the lhs model we consider situations where @xmath25corresponds to a mode annihilation or creation operator ? to give meaning to the lhs model do we need to consider lhv  probabilities @xmath685  associated with the outcomes of measuring * *  * * _ _ two _ _ * *  * * observables @xmath686  for sub - system @xmath9  when the hidden variables are @xmath78  and which may correspond to quantum operators that do not commute ?",
    "what happens when we need to consider a product such as @xmath687  such as may occur when we are considering expressions for variances ?",
    "would this mean that for products of subsystem observables we should determine the mean values via @xmath688where @xmath689  @xmath690  and @xmath691  @xmath692  ?",
    "but what meaning is there to the quantum expression when the corresponding operators @xmath693  do not commute ?",
    "none of these questions arise in considering whether spin squeezing is a test for standard quantum entanglement , since no hidden variables are involved nor are issues of the existence of probabilities for measurement of individual subsystem operators that may become involved in the evaluation .",
    "however , when non - quantum lhv expressions for measurement probabilities are involved , the analogous results to those for quantum mean values need further consideration .",
    "until  these issues are resolved we can not begin to modify the operator based proof regarding the consequences for spin variances and means for the lhs state .",
    "the proof would involve expressions giving meaningful interpretations to the mean values of what would appear to be non - physical quantities such as mode annihilation and creation operators for subsystem @xmath9 .      before dealing with the above issues it is useful to prove some results for mean values and variances in lhv that are analogous to similar results in quantum theory .",
    "we now consider the measurement of an observable @xmath128 with outcomes @xmath694 for a preparation process @xmath3 .",
    "the probability @xmath695 for this outcome can be written in lhv as @xmath696where @xmath6 are the hidden variables and @xmath5 is the probability for preparation process @xmath3 that the hidden variables are @xmath78 and @xmath697 is the probabilty of outcome @xmath694 for measurement of @xmath128 when the hidden variables are @xmath78 .",
    "the _ mean value _ for measurement outcomes for observable @xmath128 will then be given by@xmath698where the first equation is the definition and the second equation shows that the mean value is given by weighting the mean value @xmath699 that would apply if the hidden variables are @xmath6 by the probability @xmath5 for these hidden variables when the preparation is @xmath3 . the result ( [ eq.meanhvtresult ] ) is similar to the quantum result for the mixed state @xmath700 where @xmath701  where @xmath702 .",

    "@xmath707 would be @xmath708this result will be useful when we consider steering tests .",

    "here we have used @xmath710 and ( eq.meanhvtdefn ) .",
    "we can then write@xmath711where the second line gives the definition for the mean of the square of the observable when the hidden variables are @xmath6and the first line expresses the mean of the square of the observable in terms of an average over this quantity .",
    "we then have@xmath712which establishes an important inequality .",
    "the second line follows from the modulus of a sum being less than the sum of the moduli and the last line follows from the cauchy inequality @xmath713 with @xmath714 .",
    "but we also have@xmath715showing that when the hidden variable is @xmath6 the variance for measured outcomes of observable @xmath128 is equal to the difference between the mean value for measured outcomes of the square of the observable and the square of the mean value ( as expected ) .",
    "we finally have the inequality@xmath716this result may be compared to the quantum theory result @xmath717 .",
    "finally , we consider mean values in lhv for complex combinations of observables @xmath191 and @xmath196 , which have measured outcomes @xmath718 and @xmath719 .",
    "we simply define@xmath720where in hvt we have@xmath721since the two fundamental probabilities @xmath722 and @xmath723 alway exist in a lhv , _ even if _ in quantum theory the corresponding operators @xmath724 and @xmath625 do _ not _ commute .",
    "this is an important feature to recognise about lhv .",
    "the result ( eq.meancomplexcombhvtdefn ) may be compared to the quantum result ( eq.meannonhermopr ) .",

    "@xmath206 @xmath726 @xmath727 and @xmath728 @xmath729 @xmath730 are the definitions of the mean values for measurement outcomes for @xmath25 and @xmath21 . the latter is also determined from quantum theory , the former is not . _ variances _ can be obtained based on considering the mean values of the squares of @xmath25 and @xmath21 . the similarities and differences between the lhs and the qss expressions ( [ eq.meanvalues ] ) and ( [ eq.meanvalqss ] ) should be noted .",
    "the experimental paper by gross et al @xcite involving atomic homodyne detection in a two mode system in which the two modes ( signal and idler ) are populated from a bec with all atoms in an @xmath731 hyperfine state .",
    "collisions of two @xmath731 hyperfine state atoms lead to one atom in each of @xmath732 and @xmath733 hyperfine states , corresponding to the signal and idler modes . measurements of the variance for the _ number difference _ and _ number sum _ for the signal signal and idler modes show a small fluctuation for the number difference and a large fluctuation for the number sum .",
    "the experiment also measures two mode _ quadrature _ variances and the results are interpreted as demonstrating epr steering .",
    "however , another possibility worth exploring is whether the difference between the variances of the number sum and number difference observables might itself provide a test for epr steering .",
    "as we will see , no such test has been found .",
    "we now consider the difference between the variances of the number sum and number difference observables . from ( [ eq.modenumboprs ] )",

    "the question is whether a test for epr steering can be obtained based on the differences in the variances of @xmath736 and @xmath737 .",
    "the differences between the variances for @xmath736  and @xmath737  are given in a lhv via@xmath738for the _ lhs model _ we then find that@xmath739 ) we have @xmath740an inequality is needed for the right side .",
    "the cauchy inequality @xmath741 with @xmath742 , @xmath743 , @xmath744 and @xmath745 is applicable since we know that both @xmath746 and @xmath747 are positive and @xmath748 .",
    "we see that @xmath749    the right side of ( [ eq.diffvarlhsmodel2 ] ) is always @xmath674 since the mean of a square always exceeds the square of the mean .",
    "but this is consistent with @xmath750so we do not have a test for epr entanglement since @xmath751 may be negative or positive for the lhs model .",
    "hence _ no _ test based on the differences of variances for the number sum and number difference is available for _ epr steering_.",
    "the inequalities ( [ eq.ineqcat1 ] ) , ( [ eq.inequalcat2 ] ) and ( eq.ineqalcat3 ) derived above can be put into a more useful form involving _ spin operators _ - whose mean values and variances can be measured .",
