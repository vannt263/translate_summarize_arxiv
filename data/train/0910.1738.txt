    "in the last few years , our knowledge of the soft gamma - ray sky ( e@xmath220 kev ) has greatly improved thanks to the observations performed by the imager ibis ( ubertini et al .",
    "2003 ) onboard integral ( winkler et al . 2003 ) and by the bat telescope ( barthelmy et al . 2005 ) onboard swift ( gehrels et al . 2004 ) .",
    "in particular , ibis is surveying the 20100 kev sky with a sensitivity better than a mcrab and a point source location accuracy of the order of a few arcmin .",
    "the 4th ibis catalog has been just released , listing 723 soft gamma - ray sources ( bird et al .",
    "it represents an extension both in exposure and sky coverage with respect to the previous catalog ( bird et al .",
    "the ibis soft gamma - ray sky is surprisingly dynamic and diverse , with many different types of objects such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , galactic x - ray binaries , cataclysmic variables ( cvs . ) and also newly discovered classes of sources such as supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts , sguera et al .",
    "2005,2006 ) and highly absorbed supergiant high mass x - ray binaries ( walter et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "recently , integral and swift have been joined in operation by the fermi gamma - ray satellite launched in june 2008 , providing a coverage of the sky over 10 orders of magnitude in energy , from kev to gev .",
    "onboard this satellite , the large area telescope ( lat , atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) is an imaging high energy gamma - ray telescope ( 20 mev  300 gev ) which provides , with respect to its predecessor egret , superior angular resolution , sensitivity , field of view and observing efficiency .",
    "these improved capabilities have allowed a catalog of 205 highly significant detections ( @xmath210@xmath1 ) after three months of an all sky survey ( abdo et al .",
    "many fermi lat sources have been identified as agns ( 121 ) and pulsars ( 30 ) , but interestingly there are also 2 high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) while the remaining objects have no obvious counterparts . to identify those sources ibis",
    "is particularly suited since it provides a hard x / soft gamma - ray point source location accuracy of the order of an arcmin as well as information close to the mev band .",
    "many of the detected fermi lat sources are expected to emit around 20 kev , i.e. in the ibis regime . with the aim of investigating such a link ,",
    "we have cross - correlated the positions of the 205 fermi lat bright sources with the 4th ibis catalog .",
    "specifically , following stephen et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) , we took both catalogs and calculated the number of lat sources which could be considered to be coincident with ibis sources as a function of distance .",
    "as a control , we then created another database of 205 false sources derived from the fermi lat catalogue but with positions mirrored in both galactic longitude and latitude .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the number of coincidences for both the real and false datasets while the bottom panel illustrates the difference between the two .",
    "the leveling off of the lower curve in fig .",
    "1 at a distance of about 4 arcminutes indicates that there is a real correlation , with @xmath3 13 - 14 sources common to both catalogs . in comparison , at this distance only one source in the fake dataset appears to be correlated .",
    "the 14 associations are listed in table 1 ( the first 14 sources in the list ) .",
    "the most likely chance correlation is 0fgl j1746.0 - 2900/igr j17459 - 2902 found in the galactic center region , i.e. where a likelihood of an association by chance is very high due to integral reaching the confusion limit and the presence of strong fermi diffuse emission overlapping with compact sources .    in applying this technique",
    ", we only employ the positions of the sources , and not the errors on these positions and therefore sources which have relatively large error boxes could become `` lost '' in the chance association distribution . in order to make use of this extra information and retrieve these associations",
    "we have applied another procedure in which we compare the distance between ibis and lat sources with the quadratic sum of their corresponding error radii .",
    "we first convert the fermi 95% and ibis 90% quoted error radii to the equivalent 1 values , which were then added in quadrature .",
    "this value is then compared with the distance between the fermi and ibis catalog positions and sources are assumed to be potentially correlated when their separation is less than 2.15@xmath1 , corresponding to 90% for a 2-d normal distribution .",
    "the result of this second procedure is to reaffirm the 14 associations found using the first method and to recuperate 2 more sources ( the last two rows in table 1 ) .",
    "the first is 1es 0033 + 59.5 which appears in both the ibis and fermi catalogs and so is assumed to be a correct association , while the second corresponds to eta carinae/0fgl j1045.6 - 5937 , listed in the fermi lat bright source catalog as unidentied .",
    "2 shows its 95% error circle ( @xmath3 7.4 arcmin radius ) superimposed on the ibis 18 - 60 kev significance mosaic with an exposure of @xmath3 2.3 ms .",
    "the clear ibis detection ( @xmath3 5.5@xmath1 ) is eta carinae , located right on the border of the lat error circle .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the agile gamma - ray satellite detected an mev source ( 1agl j1043 - 5931 , 95% error radius of 0.68 degrees ) consistent with the position of eta carinae ( tavani et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "for all the remaining 189 fermi lat sources for which no ibis counterpart was found , we calculated the 2@xmath1 upper limit in the energy band 20 - 40 kev , and these are listed in table 2 .",
    "the fermi sources firmly detected by ibis comprise the 10 optically identified agns complemented by the 2 isolated pulsars crab and vela and 2 hmxb , while there are a further two possible associations with unidentified fermi sources .",
    "this can be interpreted as an indication that the acceleration processes dominating in the high energy range are only partially efficient in the soft gamma ray regime .",
    "vice versa , the well populated integral sky , comprising 13% lmxb , 13% hmxb , 35% agn , 10% pulsar , snr and cv and 29% unknown emitter , is barely detectable at mev energies , in spite of the unprecedented sensitivity of fermi .",
    "figure 3 shows the gamma - ray flux ( 100 mev - 1 gev ) of each catalogued lat source as a function of the ibis flux in the 20 - 40 kev range .",
    "first of all we note that no lat sources ( except for the peculiar object eta carinae ) have been detected by ibis at a flux below 1 mcrab despite the fact that a large fraction of the ibis sky has a detection limit well below this value ( typically about 0.1 mcrab ) and is well populated with hard x - ray sources .",
    "this indicates that the typical lat source is either very strong or very weak in the ibis energy range providing important information on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these objects .",
    "further , only a couple of the seyfert 1 and 2 detected by integral ( bassani , et al . , 2009 ,",
    "beckmann , et al .",
    ", 2009 , molina , et al . , 2009 ) are present in the fermi catalog , i.e. the two bright radio galaxies ngc1275 and cen a. in contrast to blazars , most radio galaxies have large inclination angles and hence their emission is not significantly amplified due to doppler beaming ; however , if the jet has velocity gradients ( georganopoulos & kazanas , 2003 , ghisellini et al . , 2005 , lenain et al . , 2008 ) then it is possible to produce bright gamma - ray emission via the ic process where one component sees the ( beamed ) radiation produced by the other , and this enhances the ic emission of all components in the jet .",
    "the majority of the associations reported in table 1 refer to blazars , mainly detected by ibis during too observations , hence in flaring , or in deep studies with long devoted exposures or because they are bright objects over the entire gamma - ray band ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "their detection in the ibis band is therefore not unexpected and suggests that the number of blazars common to both gamma - ray regimes will increase as the integral and fermi catalogues expand .",
    "interestingly , ibis also sees both types of blazars , i.e. flat spectrum radio quasars ( flsq ) and bl lac type objects . in the widely adopted scenario of blazars",
    ", a single population of high - energy electrons in a relativistic jet radiates from the radio / fir to the uv / soft x - rays by the synchrotron process and at higher frequencies by inverse compton scattering of soft photons present either in the jet ( synchrotron self - compton [ ssc ] model ) , in the surrounding material ( external compton [ ec ] model ) , or in both ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) . therefore , a strong signature of the blazar nature of a source is a double peaked structure in the sed , with the synchrotron component peaking anywhere from infrared to x - rays and the inverse compton extending up to gev or even tev gamma - rays ( maraschi and tavecchio , 2003 sambruna et al . , 2006 ) .    the analysis of the gamma - ray properties of fermi blazars ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) have revealed that the average gev spectra of bl lac objects are significantly harder ( @xmath4 @xmath31.99@xmath50.22 ) than the spectra of fsrqs ( @xmath4 @xmath3 2.40 @xmath50.17 ) .",
    "this is probably due to fermi observing different parts of the compton bump in the different blazar populations : the ascending part in bl lac and the descending part in fsrq .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed with ibis detected blazars despite the poor statistics .",
    "the class of bl lac objects seen by ibis , including bl lac , mkn501 and mkn421 , are weak emitters in soft gamma rays when not flaring and have 20 - 100 kev spectral indices usually steeper than 2 ( guetta et al . , 2004 , lichti et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "conversely , the fsrq , including 3c454.3 , pks1830 - 211 , 3c273 and 3c279 are characterised by harder spectra , though more easily detectable by ibis in the 20 - 100 kev range even if in the quiescent state ( de rosa et al , 2005 , vercellone , et al . , 2008 , iafrate et al .",
    "2009 , chernyakova et al 2007 ) .",
    "their sustained emission in this energy range is due to ic plus ec on a broad line region ( blr ) or disk photons in the case of 3c454.3,(vercellone et al . , 2008 ) , to a mix of ssc plus ec from a blr and torus for pks 1830 - 211 , ( de rosa et al , 2005 ) and to a more complex scenario in the cases of 3c279 and 3c273 ( costamante , et al . , 2009 , s. soldi et al.,2008 ) . the difference in the spectral shapes of bl lac and fsrq recently reported by integral / ibis and swift / bat ( ajello et al .",
    "2009 ) indicates that their energy range probes the end part of the synchrotron peak in bl lacs and the ascending part of the compton peak in fsrq .",
    "as far as galactic sources are concerned , the only two fermi isolated pulsars detected by ibis ( crab and vela ) are among the brightest gamma - ray sources known ( 100 mev - 1 gev ) .",
    "ibis also detected a few more pulsars including the newly discovered hard x - ray pulsars psr b1509 - 58 and psr b0540 - 69 as well as some radio quiet / dim young pulsars located in snrs ( psr bj1846 - 0258 , psr b1811 - 1925 and psr b1617 - 5055 ) .",
    "these spin - powered pulsars are characterized by a hard spectral tail and different pulse profile though the radio quiet / dim ones show both light curves and spectral shape of the pulsed spectrum similar to psr b1509 - 58 .",
    "the non - thermal hard x - ray component can be explained with synchrotron emission both in a slot - gap or outer - gap model ( hirotani et al .",
    "2008 ) , but there is not yet any firm conclusion on the origin of the high energy electrons and how and where they are being accelerated . apart from the crab with a luminosity peak at around 100 kev ,",
    "all the remaining gamma - ray pulsars show a dominating emission at energies higher than 10 mev .    of particular interest",
    "are the ibis detections of the two fermi hmxbs ls 5309 and ls i + 61 303 .",
    "it has been suggested that these are both microquasars although another scenario is that they host young non - accreting pulsars and are powered by the interaction between the pulsars relativistic wind and the wind from the massive stellar companion ( dubus 2006 ) .",
    "both these hmxbs are those with the most exposure ( apart from the crab ) at tev energies , and now also in the mev / gev regime .",
    "the measurements indicate that the emission mechanisms active in these two energy ranges are not correlated ( abdo et al .",
    "2009b , holder et al .",
    "integral has detected several ( 10 - 15 ) bhc / microquasar candidates , but it is necessary that fermi detects more of these sources in order to be able to disentangle the emission mechanisms active at high energies and at soft gamma - rays in these objects .",
    "from our analysis it appears that mev / gev fermi sources are not commonly associated with ibis sources in the range 20  100 kev .",
    "the handful of objects common to both surveys comprise so far mainly fsrq and bl lac , with no xrb apart from the two microquasars . equally absent are the axp which are strong emitters in the kev - mev range with a total energy rising in @xmath6f@xmath6 and no cut - off detected up to a few hundreds of kev ( kuiper and hermsen 2009 ) , implying some kind of switch - off mechanism in the mev regime .",
    "similarly , sgr and magnetars , detected even in quiescence mode by ibis ( rea et al , 2009 ) and among the brightest sources when flaring ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1999 , gotz et al . 2006 ,",
    "israel et al .",
    "2008 ) are not detected so far by fermi / lat .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
