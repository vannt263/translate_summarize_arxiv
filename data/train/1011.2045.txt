    "work by @xcite , later updated by @xcite , suggested a relationship between the speed class ( in terms of the time for the wind flux to decline 3 magnitudes from peak @xmath14 @xmath22 ) and the major to minor axis ratio of the expanding nova shell , where the faster the nova the less the degree of shaping .",

    "( a colour version of this figure is available in the online journal.),width=283 ]    several mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in the shaping of cn ejecta .",
    "these can be identified as that associated with the common - envelope phase during outburst , the presence of a magnetised wd , the spin of the wd and an asymmetric thermonuclear runaway ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the most widely accepted model involves the common - envelope phase where the ejecta from the wd envelope engulf the secondary star within a matter of minutes following outburst .",
    "the secondary transfers energy and angular momentum to the ejecta ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "wd rotation , when incorporated into calculations of the common - envelope phase , produces the observed prolate remnants @xcite .",
    "it is desirable when dealing with modelling to reduce computing time and yet have a physically sound model .",
    "the modelling of permitted line profiles so early after outburst is complicated by the fact that they are most likely affected by an optically thick medium .",
    "the full treatment of radiative transfer requires full knowledge of several parameters of the system and further assumptions are required .",
    "for example , the temperature of the central system in outburst , which can be derived from multi - frequency observations , and the density of each component , which is much harder to derive since we must assume an ejected mass and a geometry of the system .",
    "we considered the effects of radiative transfer on the line profile and found that the the lower the inclination the more the absorption affects the system but the overall line shape does not significantly change from the optically thin case .",
    "furthermore , the absorption affects more the lower velocity systems .",
    "so when dealing with the results caution is necessary especially with the densities derived from the models because applying a density in the optically thin case will actually be only a lower limit to the true density of a system with greater opacity .",
    "we also made the assumption that at early times the structures are still volume filled .",
    "@xcite have shown the h@xmath8 spectral evolution of v382 vel from early outburst to the nebular stages ( 5 to 498 days after outburst ) ; at early stages the line profile showed an asymmetric saddle - shape with the blue component more prominent than the red .",
    "the blue component diminishes in strength and the whole line profile develops to become a flat - topped shape .",
    "they associate this with the termination of the post - outburst wind phase and the complete ejection of the envelope .",
    "our higher resolution spectra , fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_evo ] , also show a similar development , and a similar interpretation can be made here .      given v2491 cyg s fast decline from maximum we assume an axial ratio of 1.15 for our chosen structures following the relationships in @xcite .",
    "we also consider the possibility of a structure similar to rs oph , first coined `` peanut - shaped '' @xcite and later modelled as a dumbbell structure with an hour - glass - shaped central overdensity @xcite .",
    "this model is included in our studies because , as mentioned before , this system has been suggested as a rn and a similar structure has been proposed for the rn u sco @xcite .",
    "the candidate structures we chose are ( i ) polar blobs with an equatorial ring ( model a , e.g. , hr del ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( ii ) a dumbbell with an inner hour - glass overdensity with an axial ratio the same as derived above for rs oph ( model b ) ; ( iii ) prolate shell with an equatorial ring ( model c ) ; and ( iv ) a prolate shell with tropical rings ( model d , e.g. , v705 cas ; * ? ? ?",
    "as noted above , model b differs from that generated by the common - envelope phase described above because the observed structure could arise due to interaction with a pre - existing red - giant wind and/or collimation by the accretion disc ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our models , as visualised in shape , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] .",
    "the lack of a resolved image of the remnant means any model is not as well constrained as when the structure is spatially resolved .",
    "however , for the models assumed above we constrain a system inclination ( where an inclination @xmath23 = 90 degrees corresponds to the orbital plane being edge - on , and @xmath23 = 0 degrees being face - on ) and an expansion assumed to take place in a hubble flow .",

    "the flux is dominated by the prolate structure .",

    "the flux is again dominated by the prolate structure .    as previously mentioned these results",
    "are not as well constrained as they would be if we could have the spectra combined with imaging data .",
    "we also performed modelling for a simple sphere .",
    "the results suggest that the best fit maximum expansion velocity @xmath24 @xmath3 2700 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the shape of the synthetic spectra was that of an inverted u ( similar to the prolate components in models c and d of fig .",
    "[ fig : model_result ] ) .        to determine",
    "the best fitting morphology we examined the derived reduced @xmath26 probabilities and found that models a and b showed comparable probabilities .",
    "the other structures gave negligible probabilities .",
    "another test we perform on our models to see which best reproduces the data , considering only models a and b , is to evolve the models to a later epoch , keeping the parameters for inclination and @xmath24 as derived from the first epoch to the second epoch . in the case of model",
    "a , it was allowed to evolve linearly .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that their central component for rs oph showed deceleration and we therefore kept this central component the same size from one epoch to the next in model b.    what is evident is that if the models are allowed to evolve linearly , with the derived parameters the same , then the line profile should look identical from one epoch to the next in the absence of other physical changes .",
    "for the line profile to change , but with the velocity field and inclination constant , there must be a transition involving other factors . just changing the densities",
    "does not suffice without the addition of new components .",
    "this transition may therefore be associated to the termination of the post - outburst wind phase and the complete ejection of the envelope , which is proposed to happen within the first couple of weeks ( as in v382 vel ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the later epoch modelling does not have a filled distribution but now has a depth of material ( shell ) determined by the first epoch model .",
    "we therefore apply a volume distribution within this shell to both models and compare with the spectrum at day 108 after outburst ( fig . [",
    "fig : spec_evo ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite from photo - ionisation models showed the nova to be in the nebular stage at day 108 after outburst and the  6548 and 6584  emission lines may contribute significantly to the h@xmath8 profile .",
    "certainly  was about ten times stronger than h@xmath8 at this time ( see table 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "we do not show the model b synthetic spectrum as it did not reproduce the observed second epoch spectrum at all well .",
    "the synthetic spectrum was that of an upside down `` t '' shape .",
    "we therefore , believe that model a is the correct model for v2491 cyg .      in light of the presence of",
    "we should account for this when modelling the spectra on day 108 .",
    "we should expect  to appear as the expanding remant becomes less dense overall and the nebular spectrum emerges . in the first instance , to fit the observed spectrum the velocities were kept constant from the first epoch for the h@xmath8 and  lines and only the relative flux was allowed to change .",
    "we assume here that the model derived for h@xmath8 is the same for .",
    "this did not reproduce the observed spectrum without introducing significant additional absorption features .",
    "we therefore allowed the velocity of the different components to change keeping the flux ratio of the  lines always at 1:3 and the relative flux of the h@xmath8 to the  lines as a free parameter .",
    "the result of this modelling is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : epoch2 ] .",
    "this provides an excellent fit to the spectrum at day 108 .",
    "the derived velocities for the polar blobs were @xmath3 3500 km  s@xmath2  ( h@xmath8 ) and @xmath3 3600 km  s@xmath2  ( ) and for the equatorial ring @xmath3 2700 km  s@xmath2  ( h@xmath8 ) and @xmath3 2600 km  s@xmath2  ( ) .",
    "these results are within 2@xmath27 of those derived for the first epoch .",
    "it should be noted that there is a change in the contributions to the flux of the different components of h@xmath8 .",
    "where in the first epoch the two components were of comparable flux , in the second epoch the ring is the major contributor to the flux with relative flux contribution of the polar blobs to the ring of 1:2.5 for h@xmath8 .",
    "this change in relative flux can be easily understood as arising from the fact that material moving at higher velocities will fade faster in h@xmath8 emission .",
    "therefore , the change shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : epoch2 ] , where the equatorial ring becomes the dominant component stems from the fact that it presents an expansion velocity lower than that of the polar blobs .    in the case of the  line",
    "the polar blobs to ring relative flux contribution is 2.2:1 .",
    "their expansion velocities are @xmath3 3600 km  s@xmath2  and @xmath3 2600 km  s@xmath2 , respectively",

    "* their figure 10 ) show a line profile at day 477 which is very different from the day 108 line profile .",

    "our model can also account for this if the densities of the different components continue to evolve . as the nebula becomes less dense",
    "we expect that the relative contribution from  should increase .",
    "there is one more test we can perform to further constrain our model .",
    "the derived inclination of 80 degrees is very high and we therefore expect eclipses whose existence we are now investigating . such eclipses should be easily observed in this system .",

    ", if v2491 cyg turns out to be eclipsing this will also enable us to determine more precisely important parameters of the central binary .",
    "of the morphologies discussed above early in outburst , models a and b , are the best fitting and give results that are very similar to each other early in outburst and this is reflected on the fact that the inclinations of the two morphologies overlap , within the errors .",
    "furthermore , the main real difference is in the size of the central region .",
    "model a is representative of a cn system , while the model b has a morphology that has been observed in the rn rs oph .    to model the second epoch observations the model was allowed to evolve into a system that was not volume filling but a shell . to replicate the observed spectrum with model a at this time we needed to introduce significant emission from the  lines and the components densities required to be changed with the equatorial ring becomimg the dominant contributor to the flux .",
    "the change in derived densities between the components should also be expected since the different components are moving at different speeds .",
    "emission from the polar blobs moving at higher speed will be observed to fade faster than the equatorial ring .",
    "model b at the second epoch did not reproduce the line profile . therefore , from the second epoch observations we suggest that model a is the most likely with an inclination of 80@xmath0 degrees and a maximum expansion velocity of 3100@xmath1 km  s@xmath2 , for the polar blobs .",
    "this velocity is in line with those found in high - ionisation absorption lines in x - ray spectra by @xcite .",
    "the high inclination found for model a is however difficult to reconcile with the outburst amplitude vs. decline rate relationship for classical novae @xcite .",
    "the observed amplitude of 10 mags is much lower than that predicted for the derived inclination of 80 degrees ( 15.5 mags ) while a pole - on system would still have a predicted amplitude of 12.5 mags .",
