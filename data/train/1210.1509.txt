    "the optical properties of small metal particles have been of interest to physicists since the time of maxwell@xcite . such particles , if subjected to light of wavelength much larger than their linear dimensions , exhibit optical resonances due to localized electronic excitations known as `` particle '' or  surface \" plasmons",
    ". these plasmons can give rise to characteristic absorption peaks , typically in the near - infrared or the visible , which may play an important role in the optical response of dilute suspensions of metal particles in a dielectric host@xcite .",
    "because of recent advances in sample preparation , it has become possible to study _ ordered _ arrays of metal particles in a dielectric host@xcite . in one - dimensional ordered arrays of such closely - spaced particles , waves of plasmonic excitations can propagate along the chains , provided that the interparticle spacing is small compared to the wavelength of light@xcite . in this limit ,",
    "the electric fields produced by the dipole moment of one nanoparticle induces dipole moments on the neighboring nanoparticles .",
    "the dispersion relations for both transverse ( @xmath1 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath0 ) plasmonic waves can then be calculated in the so - called quasistatic approximation@xcite , in which the curl of the electric field is neglected .",
    "while this approximation neglects some significant coupling between the plasmonic waves and free photons@xcite , it gives reasonable results over most of the brillouin zone .",
    "interest in such plasmonic waves has grown vastly in recent years@xcite .    in this paper , we extend the study of propagating plasmonic waves in two ways .",
    "first , we calculate the dispersion relation for such plasmonic waves when the metallic chain is immersed in an anisotropic host , such as a nematic liquid crystal ( nlc ) . using a simple approximation",
    ", we show that both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves have modified dispersion relations when the director is parallel to the chain axis .",
    "if the director is perpendicular to that axis , we show that the previously degenerate @xmath1 branches are split into two separate branches . secondly , we consider the effects of a static magnetic field applied either parallel and perpendicular to the chain .",
    "for the parallel case we show that a linearly polarized @xmath1 wave is rotated as it propagates along the chain . for a field of 2 tesla and reasonable parameters for the metal",
    ", this faraday rotation may be as large as 1 - 2@xmath3 over ten interparticle spacings . a perpendicular field mixes together the @xmath0 branch and one of the @xmath1 branches , leading to two elliptically polarized branches .",
    "these results suggest that either an nlc host or an applied magnetic field could be used as an additional `` control knob '' to manipulate the properties of the propagating waves in some desired way .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the formalism which allows one to calculate the dispersion relations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 waves in the presence of either an anisotropic host or an applied dc magnetic field . in section iii",
    ", we give simple numerical examples , and we follow this by a brief concluding discussion in section iv .",
    "we consider a chain of identical metal nanoparticles , each a sphere of radius @xmath4 , arranged in a one - dimensional periodic lattice along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "the n@xmath6 particle is assumed centered at @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the propagation of plasmonic waves along such a chain of nanoparticles has already been considered extensively for the case of isotropic metal particles embedded in a homogeneous , isotropic medium@xcite .",
    "various works have considered the quasistatic case in which the electric field is assumed to be curl - free ; this is roughly applicable when both the radius of the particles and the distance between them are small compared the wavelength of light @xcite .",
    "the extension of such studies to include radiative corrections , i.  e. , to the case when the electric fields can not be approximated as curl - free , has also been carried out ; these corrections can be very important even in some long - wavelength regimes @xcite .",
    "here we consider how the plasmon dispersion relations are modified when the particle chain is immersed in an anisotropic dielectric , such as an nlc , or subjected to an applied dc magnetic field .",
    "for the case of metallic particles immersed in an nlc , we assume that the host medium is a uniaxial dielectric , with principal dielectric constants @xmath9 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . for metal particles in the presence of an applied magnetic field ,",
    "we take the host medium to be vacuum , with dielectric constant unity .    in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the medium inside the particles is assumed to have a scalar dielectric function @xmath11 .",
    "if there is a magnetic field along the @xmath5 axis , the dielectric function of the particles becomes a tensor , whose components may be written @xmath12 with all other components vanishing @xcite . in the calculations below , we will assume that the nanoparticles are adequately described by a drude dielectric function .",
    "in this case , the components of the dielectric tensor take the form @xcite @xmath13 and @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the plasma frequency , @xmath16 is a relaxation time , and @xmath17 is the cyclotron frequency , where @xmath18 is the magnetic field , @xmath19 is the electron mass , and @xmath20 is its charge .",
    "we will use gaussian units throughout . in the limit @xmath21 , we may write @xmath22      we first assume that the host has a dielectric tensor @xmath23 with principal components @xmath9 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "such a form is appropriate , for example , in a nematic liquid crystal below its nematic - to - isotropic transition .",
    "we begin by writing down the electric field at @xmath24 due to a sphere with a polarization @xmath25 . in component form",

    ", we consider the polarization of the n@xmath6 particle , which we write as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the electric field within the n@xmath6 particle and @xmath42 .",
    "this field , in turn , is related to the external field acting on the n@xmath6 particle and arising from the dipole moments of all the other particles .",
    "we approximate this external field as uniform over the volume of the particle , and denote it @xmath43",
    ". this approximation should be reasonable if the particle radius is not too large compared to the separation between particles ( in practice , an adequate condition is probably @xmath44 , where @xmath4 is the particle radius and @xmath45 the nearest neighbor separation )",

    "we also plot the corresponding rotation angles @xmath161 for a distance equal to one interparticle spacing in fig .",

    "im@xmath164 is also small , showing that a linear incident wave acquires little ellipticity over such distances . over a distance of thirty or so interparticle separations ,",
    "a linearly polarized transverse wave would typically rotate by only 1 - 3@xmath3 .",
    "since theory and experiment suggests that the wave _ intensity _ typically has an exponential decay length of no more than around 20 interparticle spacings @xcite , the likely faraday rotation of such a wave in practice will probably not exceed a degree or two , at most , even for a field as large as 2 t. thus , while the rotation found here is likely to be measurable , it may not be large , at least for this simple chain geometry with one particle per unit cell .",
    "the present expressions also indicate that @xmath127 is very nearly linear in b , so a larger rotation could be attained by increasing b.    as can be seen , @xmath127 depends strongly on frequency in the case of zero damping , but less so at finite damping . in the ( unrealistic ) no - damping case , at the very top and the very bottom of the plasmonic band , only one of the two circularly polarized waves can propagate down the chain . because this filtering occurs only over a very narrow frequency range ( of order @xmath165 ) , and",
    "because this calculation assumes no damping , it would be quite difficult to detect a region where only one of the two circularly polarized waves can propagate .    finally , we mention the case where @xmath166 for the same parameters as in the parallel case .",
    "the effect of a finite b causes two non - degenerate dispersion relations ( one an @xmath0 and the other a @xmath1 wave ) for the perpendicular case to become mixed .",
    "we have not computed the rotation angles for this perpendicular case , but we expect that they would be similar in magnitude to the values shown in fig .  4 .",
    "the calculations and formalism presented in the previous section leave out several effects which may be at least quantitatively important .",
    "first , in our numerical calculations , but not in the formalism , we have included only nearest neighbor dipolar coupling .",
    "inclusion of further neighbors will quantitatively alter the dispersion relations in all cases considered , as well as the faraday rotation angle when there is an applied magnetic field , but these effects should not be very large , as is already suggested by the early calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite for an isotropic host .",
    "another possible effect will appear when @xmath167 is significantly greater than @xmath168 , namely , the emergence of quadrupolar and higher quasistatic bands@xcite .",
    "these will mix with the dipolar band and alter its shape .",
    "for the separations we consider , this multipolar effect should be small . also , even if @xmath169 , the plasmon dispersion relations will still be altered by an nlc host or by an applied magnetic field in the manner described here .",
    "the present treatment also omits radiative damping . in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "such damping is known to be small but non - zero in the long - wavelength limit , but it becomes more significant when the particle radius is a substantial fraction of a wavelength .",
    "even at long wavelengths , radiative damping can be very important at certain characteristic values of the wave vector@xcite .",
    "we have not , as yet , extended the present approach to include such radiative effects .",
    "we expect that , just as for an isotropic host in the absence of a magnetic field , radiative effects will further damp the propagating plasmons in the geometries we consider , but will not qualitatively change the effects we have described .    for the case",
    "when the host is an nlc , the present work oversimplifies the treatment of the nlc host by assuming that the director field is _ uniform _ , i.  e. , position - independent . in reality",
    ", the director is almost certain to be modified close to the metal nanoparticle surface , i.  e. , to become nonuniform , as has been pointed out by many authors@xcite .",
    "the effects of such complications on the optical properties of a single metallic particle immersed in an nlc have been treated , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , and similar approaches might be possible for the present problem also .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that the dispersion relations for plasmonic waves propagating along a chain of closely spaced nanoparticles of drude metal are strongly affected by external perturbations .",
    "first , if the host is a uniaxially anisotropic dielectric ( such as a nematic liquid crystal ) , the dispersion relations of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes are significantly modified , compared to those of an isotropic host , and if the director axis of the nlc is perpendicular to the chain , the two degenerate transverse branches are split . secondly ,",
    "if the chain is subjected to an applied magnetic field parallel to the axis , the @xmath1 waves undergo a small but measurable faraday rotation , and also acquire a slight ellipticity .",
    "a similar ellipticity develops if the magnetic field is perpendicular to the chain , but its effect will likely be more difficult to observe , because the magnetic field couples two non - degenerate branches of the dispersion relation .",
    "all these effects show that the propagation of such plasmonic waves can be tuned , by either a liquid crystalline host or a magnetic field , so as to change the frequency band where wave propagation can occur , or the polarization of these waves",
    ". this control may be valuable in developing devices using plasmonic waves in future optical circuit design .",

    "<S> a chain of metallic particles , of sufficiently small diameter and spacing , allows linearly polarized plasmonic waves to propagate along the chain . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider how these waves are altered by an anisotropic host ( such as a nematic liquid crystal ) or an applied magnetic field . in a liquid crystalline host , with principal axis ( director ) oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the chain , we find that the dispersion relations of both the longitudinal ( @xmath0 ) and transverse ( @xmath1 ) modes are significantly altered relative to those of an isotropic host . furthermore , </S>",
    "<S> when the director is perpendicular to the chain , the doubly degenerate @xmath1 branch is split by the anisotropy of the host material . with an applied magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 parallel to the chain , the propagating transverse modes are circularly polarized , and the left and right circularly polarized branches have slightly different dispersion relations . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> if a linearly polarized transverse wave is launched along the chain , it undergoes faraday rotation . for parameters approximating that of a typical metal and for a field of 2 t , </S>",
    "<S> the faraday rotation is of order 1@xmath3 per ten interparticle spacings , even taking into account single - particle damping . if @xmath2 is perpendicular to the chain , one of the @xmath1 branches mixes with the @xmath0 branch to form two elliptically polarized branches . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations include single - particle damping and can , in principle , be generalized to include radiation damping . </S>",
    "<S> the present work suggests that the dispersion relations of plasmonic waves on chain of nanoparticles can be controlled by immersing the chain in a nematic liquid crystal and varying the director axis , or by applying a magnetic field . </S>"
