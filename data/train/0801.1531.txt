    "recent years have seen an increase in the number of experiments using noble liquids as materials for detecting weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , a well motivated dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "the current best limit for the spin - independent wimp - nucleon cross section for a 60-gev wimp mass is @xmath2 , set by the cryogenic dark matter search ( cdms ) experiment  @xcite .",
    "because many noble liquids have high scintillation yields , are easily purified of radioactive impurities , and are likely scalable to large masses with relative ease , they hold great promise for this application . the current best limit from a noble liquid detector is @xmath3 @xmath4 at 100 gev , set by xenon10  @xcite .",
    "noble liquid detectors with larger target masses will likely improve on these limits .",
    "the key to the noble liquid dark matter detectors is discriminating between nuclear recoil events that constitute a wimp signal and electronic recoil events that form the primary backgrounds .",
    "the xenon and zeplin experiments are designed to collect both scintillation light and ionization from liquid xenon  @xcite .",
    "these are dual - phase detectors that use both scintillation light and ionization charge collection to discriminate between event classes , as nuclear recoils and electronic recoils produce different ratios of charge to light .",
    "liquid argon is an attractive alternative to liquid xenon due to the lower cost of natural argon and its simpler purification requirements .",
    "the wimp argon programme ( warp ) and argon dark matter ( ardm ) experiments employ dual - phase detectors that use liquid argon as the target  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a single - phase detector collecting solely scintillation light might distinguish electronic and nuclear recoils using pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) . in 1977 , kubota _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the time dependence of scintillation light in liquid xenon and liquid argon is significantly different for heavy ionizers such as @xmath5 particles and fission fragments when compared to light ionizers such as @xmath6 decay and compton - scattered electrons  @xcite .",
    "this is because scintillation in liquid noble gases is produced by the decay of excimers that can exist in either singlet or triplet molecular states , which have very different lifetimes ( table [ table : nobles ] ) .",
    "the slow scintillation light emitted by triplet molecules can be suppressed in intensity by destructive triplet interactions , primarily penning ionization and electron - triplet spin exchange ; it is believed that these reactions are stronger for high excitation densities such as those produced by nuclear recoils , causing the observed time dependences .",
    "therefore , the relative amplitudes of the fast and slow components can be used to determine which type of excitation occurred for a given event .",
    ".lifetimes of the singlet and triplet states for neon , argon , and xenon excimers  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we estimate the erc as the number of tagged electronic recoil events with @xmath7 divided by the total number of electronic recoil events , where @xmath8 is the estimated mean @xmath9 for nuclear recoils of that energy .",
    "this restriction sets a nuclear recoil acceptance level of approximately 50% .",
    "since the shielding , coincidence , and timing cuts do not eliminate all neutron backgrounds in the detector , a background estimation @xmath10 is made by measuring the rate of background neutrons @xmath11 and assuming that the background is dominated by these neutrons hitting in accidental coincidence with @xmath12 rays ( @xmath13 in the liquid scintillator during the time allowed by the time - of - flight cut : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the acquisition time of the data . to enable comparison with the measured erc , we divide @xmath10 for each energy bin by the total number of electronic recoil events in that bin .",
    "figure  [ fig : aa_57 ] shows the erc observed using the prompt fraction method .",
    "we also plot the background estimation , two psd projections based on the statistical model described below , and the erc observed by applying a multibin method of psd described in the next section .",
    "we convert the energy axis in fig .  [",
    "fig : aa_57 ] to kev of nuclear recoil energy ( kevr ) from kevee by dividing all electron equivalent energies by a constant nuclear recoil scintillation efficiency of 0.29 .",
    "this value was obtained by measurements using the same apparatus described in this paper and will be discussed in an upcoming publication  @xcite .",
    "we present the psd results in kevr because that is the unit of interest for a dark matter detector . using the prompt fraction method , for a nuclear recoil acceptance level of approximately @xmath1",
    ", we measure a background- and statistics - limited level of erc in our detector of @xmath16 between 52 and 110 kevr ( 11 contamination events ) .",
    "we observe no nuclear recoil - like events above 69 kevr . for comparison",
    ", there is an uncorrelated neutron background rate of @xmath17 mhz between 69 and 110 kevr , corresponding to 0.25 expected background counts in that energy range .",
    "following work done by members of the deap collaboration  @xcite , we model our estimates of the number of photoelectrons in the prompt and late time windows , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as normally distributed , independent random variables with means @xmath20 and @xmath21 and variances @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the estimated total number of photoelectrons , @xmath24 , is also a random variable , with mean @xmath25 and variance @xmath26 .",
    "we express @xmath20 and @xmath21 in terms of @xmath27 and @xmath28 and we decompose the variances into two components : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent additional sources of random variability beyond what we expect from poisson counting statistics ( for example , integration noise ) .",
    "hinkley  @xcite has described in detail the probability density function of the ratio of two normally distributed , correlated random variables . for simplicity ,",
    "we present here an approximation [ given by eq .  9 of ref .",
    "@xcite ] to the pdf of @xmath32 : @xmath33 , \\label{eqn : mf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the fact that the correlation , @xmath34 , between @xmath35 and @xmath36 is @xmath37 for the analysis below , we use the exact pdf [ eq .  1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ] , although in practice the approximation is extremely good down to the lowest energy bin examined .",
    "we fit the electronic recoil data with the statistical model in each energy bin by fixing @xmath38 according to our measured light yield and treating @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 as free parameters .",
    "we assume that the statistical distribution of @xmath39 does not strongly depend on the value of @xmath38 for events of the same energy .",
    "for any particular energy deposit , @xmath38 is a random variable , and events due to many different energy deposits can contribute to prompt ratio data in any one bin in @xmath38 space .",
    "the probability density function for prompt ratio data is a mixture of energy dependent pdfs , and we neglect this energy blurring effect .",
    "simple monte carlo studies suggest that the ratio - of - gaussians model breaks down for idealized gaussian data due to the constraint on @xmath38 resulting from the binning of data , and this effect has not been taken into account in our analysis .",
    "we use the statistical model to estimate the expected fraction of electronic recoils that are misclassified as nuclear recoils : @xmath40 here , we choose @xmath41 to set the nuclear recoil acceptance level to approximately 50% , and we choose the parameters of @xmath42 according to the fits to the electronic recoil @xmath9 distribution .",
    "[ fig : aa_57 ] shows the predicted erc versus energy according to this model .",
    "we also plot the idealized case where @xmath31 and @xmath30 are set to 0 . in general",
    ", we expect that the normal distribution model for @xmath18 and @xmath19 is an approximation for any energy of interest .",
    "for the idealized case where @xmath43 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 would be poisson random variables rather than gaussian random variables . hence , the erc predicted by the ratio - of - gaussians model for the idealized case should be interpreted with caution particularly at lower energies where the accuracy of a normal distribution model for a poisson random variable can be very poor .",
    "figure  [ fig : statmodel ] shows an example of the model fit for 1415 kevee and 3031 kevee electronic recoil events . there is a deviation from the model at low @xmath9 values that we attribute to pile - up and noise triggers .",
    "there is also an excess of events in the high @xmath9 region .",
    "this excess might be caused by edge effects in our detector coming from @xmath12 tracks going into the walls or the tpb layer , producing extra prompt light .",
    "a larger detector with position reconstruction capability might be able to eliminate such edge effects",
    ". there could be some unknown phenomena at work in the production and decay of argon molecular states , yielding a small fraction of events with anomalously large @xmath9 values .",
    "a third possibility is approximation error stemming from incorrect model assumptions , such as the gaussianity of @xmath18 and @xmath19 or the effect of data binning .",
    "these possible effects can be better investigated by detectors with improved neutron shielding , and future studies will require more work to better calibrate the erc predictions made by the ratio - of - gaussians model .",
    "figure  [ fig : noise ] shows the fitted values of the variances , @xmath44 and @xmath45 versus the estimated number of photoelectrons in @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "the ideal case of zero additional noise ( @xmath46 ) has been shown for comparison .",
    "the relationship between the estimated variance parameters and the corresponding estimates of the number of photoelectrons is approximately linear , suggesting that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are proportional to @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "straight line fits to the late and prompt variances have slopes of 2.2 and 1.3 , respectively . due to the various uncertainties in the fit such as that associated with data binning",
    ", these numbers do not represent a rigorous estimate of the amount of noise in the late and prompt distributions ; however , they might be used as a point of comparison with future detectors in trying to reduce the overall noise in the system .",
    "possible sources of this additional noise include integration noise , the widths of the single photoelectron spectra , and variability in the prompt window size arising from uncertainty in the determined trigger position .",
    "to improve psd , future experiments will need to reduce the size of this additional noise to approach the ideal case .",
    "the prompt fraction method of psd is based on binning the voltage trace into two time bins .",
    "we generalize this approach by representing a normalized voltage trace as a @xmath49 dimensional matrix . in this representation",
    ", we categorize the data by the number of photoelectrons in the event , and @xmath50 refers to this division of data into photoelectron bins .",
    "we also partition the voltage trace into @xmath51 time bins .",
    "we choose @xmath52 for ease of computation , but there may be a better choice of @xmath51 . with the exception of the four smallest signal bins , which have been combined to form bins of 2029 and 3039 photoelectrons , we use the same average voltage traces obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : timepdf ] as templates .",
    "we partition each template into @xmath52 time bins .",
    "the upper and lower endpoints of each time bin are selected so that the fractions of the template trace for 8099 photoelectron electronic recoil events that falls in each time bin are approximately equal .",
    "the initial bin starts 50 ns before the trigger , and the endpoints of each bin are as follows , measured in nanoseconds from the trigger : 8 , 18 , 56 , 200 , 440 , 750 , 1180 , 1800 , 2950 , and 8000 .",
    "we do not adjust these endpoints for different photoelectron number but use the 8099 photoelectron based time binning scheme for all cases .",
    "the @xmath53th component of the normalized template for an event that falls in the @xmath54th photoelectron bin for the nuclear and electronic recoil classes is denoted @xmath55 or @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "for instance , @xmath57 represents the fraction of the 2029 photoelectron nuclear recoil template trace that falls in the first time bin ( between 50 ns before the trigger and 8 ns after the trigger ) .    to assign an event to",
    "either the nuclear recoil or electronic recoil class , we first compute a discrimination statistic for the event .",
    "we motivate a discrimination statistic based on analysis of an idealized experiment in which we could observe the absolute detection time of each photoelectron without error . in this ideal case , for a fixed number of detected photoelectrons , the observed number of photoelectrons in the time bins is a multinomial random variable .    given that the fraction of detected photoelectrons in the @xmath53th bin is @xmath58 , the multinomial log - likelihood statistics for the nuclear and electronic recoil classes are @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively  @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath38 is the total number of detected photoelectrons , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the expected values of the fraction of detected photoelectrons in the @xmath53th time bin for the nuclear and electronic recoil classes , respectively . for this idealized case ,",
    "a natural choice for the discrimination statistic is the log - likelihood ratio statistic , @xmath61 :    @xmath62    in our experiment , the observed data is not multinomial , primarily because we observe a noisy voltage waveform rather than discrete detection times .",
    "nonetheless , we compute a discrimination statistic using eqns .",
    "[ eq : logn][eq : logratio ] where we estimate @xmath38 and @xmath58 from any voltage trace of interest , and determine @xmath56 and @xmath55 as described earlier .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratio ] shows a scatter plot of @xmath63 versus energy , analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] . from this point",
    "the analysis parallels the prompt fraction method , as we form histograms of @xmath63 by energy bin and fit a gaussian function to the observed @xmath63 statistics to estimate the mean of @xmath63 .",
    "[ fig : maxgaussian ] shows an example of the fitted projections for 1415 kevee and 3031 kevee events .    for each energy bin",
    ", we estimate the mean values of @xmath61 for nuclear recoils based on the gaussian fits to the observed distributions , and this estimated mean value determines an approximate @xmath1 nuclear acceptance threshold .",
    "we then determine the fraction of events in the tagged electronic recoil data set that have discrimination statistics less than this mean value to determine the observed level of erc using the multi - bin method .",
    "if we determine the @xmath1 nuclear acceptance threshold by finding the median values of the nuclear recoil distributions , the observed erc is not significantly affected .",
    "figure  [ fig : aa_57 ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : promptfraction ] shows the erc using the multibin method .",
    "the multibin method outperforms the prompt fraction method by as much as an order of magnitude . for a nuclear recoil acceptance of approximately @xmath1",

    "we observe no contamination events above 62 kevr using the multibin method .",
    "we predict the psd achievable in a large detector with many pmts by assuming we can measure discrete times for each photoelectron detected in an event .",
    "we simulate events in this detector using the pdfs measured in sec .",

    "we define the log - likelihood function , @xmath66 , of this data following ref .  @xcite as @xmath67 where @xmath68 @xmath69 is the time at which the energy deposit occurs , @xmath70 is the pdf for the observed photoelectrons [ eq .

    "additionally , the time window in our simulations is 40 @xmath82s , so @xmath83 .",
    "thus , for our case the likelihood function of the observed data is well approximated as @xmath84    following ref .",
    "@xcite and the discussion above , for each simulated event we determine @xmath85 for both the electronic and nuclear recoil event classes as modeled in sec .  [ sec : timepdf ] . these values are denoted @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "the event is assigned to the nuclear recoil class if @xmath88 is less than an adjustable threshold that can be varied to increase the discrimination against electronic recoils at the cost of decreasing nuclear recoil acceptance . the monte carlo estimate of the distribution of @xmath88 has prominent ripples even though the monte carlo estimates of @xmath90 and @xmath91 do not . in our monte carlo study , we simulate events that yield a fixed number of photoelectrons according to pdfs with the assumption of perfect knowledge .",
    "furthermore , we neglect dark current noise . in an actual experiment",
    ", we expect that imperfect energy resolution due to variability in counting statistics and dark current effects would attenuate the ripples in the @xmath88 distribution .",
    "to illustrate the maximum likelihood method , we simulate a detector with a signal yield of 6 photoelectrons / kevee , as might be possible in a detector with full pmt coverage .",
    "we neglect dark current and we set the discrimination threshold to accept 50% of nuclear recoils .",
