    "this note reports the tevatron average top - quark mass obtained by combining the most precise published and preliminary measurements of the top - quark mass , @xmath2 .",
    "the experiments cdf and d , taking data at the tevatron proton - antiproton collider located at the fermi national accelerator laboratory , have made several direct experimental measurements of the top - quark mass , @xmath2 .",
    "the pioneering measurements were based on about @xmath3 of  data  [ 1 - 12 ] collected from 1992 to 1996 , and include results from the @xmath4  ( all - j ) , @xmath5  ( l+j ) or @xmath6 .",
    "decay channels with explicit tau lepton identification are presently under study and are not yet used for measurements of the top - quark mass .",
    "decays with @xmath7 are included in the direct @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels .",
    "] , and @xmath10  ( di - l ) decay channels .",
    "several more measurements have been performed in  ( 2001 - present ) in all decay modes .",
    "the  measurements considered here are the most recent results in the l+j , di - l , and all - j channels using @xmath11 of data and improved analysis techniques  [ 13  20 ] . with respect to the march 2009 combination@xcite",
    ", the preliminary  cdf measurement in the l+j channel has been updated using 5.6fb@xmath12 of data , and improved analysis technique@xcite .",
    "the now published  cdf measurement in the di - l channel@xcite has been substituted with a more precise preliminary result that uses 4.8fb@xmath12 of data@xcite .",
    "also , the  measurements in the all - j channel , and the measurement based on charged particle tracking have been published@xcite .",
    "the d  measurements are unchanged .",
    "the tevatron average top - quark mass is thus obtained by combining five published  measurements  @xcite with two published  cdf results  @xcite , two preliminary  cdf results  @xcite and two preliminary  d  results  [ 18  20 ] .",
    "the combination takes into account the statistical and systematic uncertainties and their correlations using the method of refs .",
    "@xcite and supersedes previous combinations  .",
    "the definition and evaluation of the systematic uncertainties and the understanding of the correlations among channels , experiments , and tevatron runs , is the outcome of many years of joint work between the cdf and d  collaborations .",
    "the input measurements and uncertainty categories used in the combination are detailed in sections  [ sec : inputs ] and  [ sec : uncertainty ] , respectively .",
    "the correlations used in the combination are discussed in section  [ sec : corltns ] and the resulting tevatron average top - quark mass is given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "a summary and outlook are presented in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "for this combination eleven measurements of @xmath2  are used : five published  results , two published  results , and four preliminary  results , all reported in table  [ tab : inputs ] .",
    "in general , the  measurements all have relatively large statistical uncertainties and their systematic uncertainties are dominated by the total jet energy scale ( jes ) uncertainty . in both cdf and d",
    "take advantage of the larger @xmath13  samples available and employ new analysis techniques to reduce both these uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the  d  analysis in the l+j channel and the  cdf analyses in the l+j and all - j channels constrain the response of light - quark jets using the kinematic information from @xmath14 decays ( _ in situ _ calibration ) .",
    "residual jes uncertainties associated with @xmath15 and @xmath16 dependencies as well as uncertainties specific to the response of @xmath17-jets are treated separately .",
    "the  cdf and d  di - l measurements and the cdf measurement of ref .",
    "@xcite use a jes determined from external calibration samples .",
    "some parts of the associated uncertainty are correlated with the  jes uncertainty as noted below .",
    ".summary of the measurements used to determine the tevatron average @xmath18 .",
    "integrated luminosity ( @xmath19 ) has units in @xmath20 , and all other numbers are in @xmath21 .",
    "the uncertainty categories and their correlations are described in the sec.[sec : uncertainty ] .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty and the total uncertainty are obtained by adding the relevant contributions in quadrature .",
    "the new measurements utilized here are the two cdf preliminary results in the last column . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : three_observables ]",
    "a preliminary combination of measurements of the mass of the top quark from the tevatron experiments cdf and d  is presented .",
    "the combination includes five published  measurements , two published  measurements , and four preliminary  measurements . taking into account the statistical and systematic uncertainties and their correlations , the preliminary result for the tevatron average is : @xmath22 , where the total uncertainty is obtained assuming gaussian systematic uncertainties . adding in quadrature the statistical and systematic uncertainties yields a total uncertainty of @xmath23 , corresponding to a relative precision of 0.61% on the top - quark mass .",
    "rounding off the uncertainty to two significant digits , the combination provides @xmath1 .",
    "the central value is 0.20gev/@xmath24 higher than our march 2009 average of @xmath25gev/@xmath24 , while the relative precision has improved by 15% with respect to the previous tevatron average .",
    "the mass of the top quark is now known with a relative precision of 0.61% , limited by the systematic uncertainties , which are dominated by the jet energy scale uncertainty .",
    "this source of systematic uncertianty is expected to improve as larger datasets are collected since analysis techniques constrain the jet energy scale using kinematical information from @xmath14 decays .",
    "it can be expected that with the full  dataset the top - quark mass will be known to an accuracy better than the one presented in this paper . to reach this level of precision further work",
    "will be focuses on a better understanding of @xmath17-jet modeling , and in the uncertainties in the signal and background simulations .",
