    "the fields due to proton and electron are not exactly opposite of each other .",
    "this should have observable effects on the formation of atoms and particularly on the time of decoupling .",
    "when we consider individual azimuthal states of dirac particles , the source term vanishes .",
    "when we consider dirac particles after the particle - antiparticle annihilation , the number density is greatly decreased so that all the available states can not be occupied . in particular ,",

    "@xmath0 is composed of even angular momentum ( @xmath66 ) states and @xmath1 is composed of odd states .",
