    "it is widely accepted that experiments in high - energy heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have produced clear signals that nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition to a deconfined partonic phase at sufficiently large values of energy density @xcite .",
    "a similar transition presumably took place in the early universe a few seconds after the big bang @xcite .",
    "in fact , this whole picture is expected from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which exhibits the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom .",
    "the nature of the quark - hadron transition , nevertheless , remains an open question . although lattice qcd @xcite , whose recently improved techniques allow for performing calculations with almost realistic quark masses @xcite , seems to indicate a crossover , the possibility of a weakly first - order transition is not ruled out from the experimental point of view . in reality , most hydrodynamic calculations within high - energy heavy ion collisions adopt an equation of state which provides a strongly first - order transition @xcite .",
    "another point that is seldom mentioned is that , being built on equilibrium assumptions , lattice qcd thermodynamics does not provide any information on the dynamical nature of the deconfining transition . in actual experiments",
    ", the critical ( dynamical ) behavior could be very different from what one would expect from a crossover in the ( equilibrium ) phase diagram , simply because the phase conversion is achieved via a nonequilibrium evolution process @xcite .",
    "indeed , results from simulations in statistical mechanics show that the critical behavior can differ significantly if one compares the equilibrium phase diagram to the ( nonequilibrium ) time evolution of a given system , and suggest that the dynamics could change the nature of the phase transition , even though the situation is still unclear @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "the scenario of a _ weakly _ first - order deconfining transition is physically appealing , especially since it comes out naturally by matching two equations of state that are realistic in their own regimes of temperature , namely the equations of state provided by lattice qcd and by a hadron resonance gas .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the process of phase conversion in a thermally - driven _ weakly _ first - order quark - hadron transition .",
    "we build an effective potential by combining the equation of state obtained from lattice simulations for one heavy and two light flavors of quarks , which we use for the partonic sector , with the equation of state of a gas of resonances for the hadronic phase . using standard techniques for the dynamics of first - order transitions , we compute bubble nucleation features , such as bubble profiles , critical radii , the surface tension and the free energy as functions of the temperature .",
    "we study the process of phase conversion evaluating the nucleation rate and investigating the time evolution of the temperature of the system and its hadronic fraction , as well as the role played by reheating .",
    "bubble nucleation is one of different simplified mechanisms used to describe the dynamics of a first - order phase transition @xcite . in this kind of transition , for temperatures",
    "slightly lower than the critical temperature , @xmath0 , the thermodynamic potential exhibits a metastable minimum besides the global minimum .",
    "the former gradually disappears as the system cools down , and is turned into a point of inflection known as spinodal instability . by decreasing further the temperature , the transition follows a qualitatively different ( explosive ) evolution , since the free energy barrier disappears and there is no extra surface cost for small amplitude long - wavelength fluctuations . therefore ,",
    "depending on the dynamics of supercooling , the phase conversion can proceed via more than one mechanism . in a slowly expanding system",
    ", the phase transition occurs through the nucleation of bubbles of the `` true vacuum '' state via thermal activation . in general , in order to know whether the system reaches the spinodal instability before nucleation is completed , it is necessary to investigate the time scale for thermal nucleation relative to that for the expansion . in the case of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )",
    "presumably formed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , the expansion of the plasma is faster than that in the case of the early universe during the cosmological quark - hadron transition by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , it is clear that one should expect major differences in the process of phase conversion when comparing the big bang to the little bang @xcite .",
    "our findings confirm the standard picture of a cosmological first - order transition , in which the process of phase conversion is entirely dominated by nucleation , also for the case of a weakly first - order transition . on the other hand , we show that , even for expansion rates much lower than those expected in high - energy heavy ion collisions , nucleation is very unlikely , indicating that the main mechanism of phase conversion is spinodal decomposition .",
    "our results are compared to those obtained for a strongly first - order transition , as the one provided by the mit bag model .",
    "the dynamics of nucleation and spinodal decomposition in the hadronization of an expanding qgp after a high - energy heavy ion collision has been studied under different approaches for more than twenty years @xcite , as is also the case for the cosmological quark - hadron transition @xcite . however , previous studies were mostly based on equations of state obtained in the frame of the mit bag model or within effective models , such as the linear sigma model @xcite , the nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite and the polyakov loop model @xcite in the environment of a strongly first - order transition .",
    "only more recently , stimulated by the findings of lattice qcd , a few studies have considered the case of a smooth crossover , and how its dynamics compares to a strongly first - order transition , including the effects from fluctuations and inhomogeneities and the presence of a critical point @xcite .",
    "our proposal in this paper is , as described above , to investigate a scenario which is in - between these two extrema .",
    "furthermore , in the case of high - energy heavy ion collisions , in which there is a very fast quench down to the spinodal instability , the dynamics can possibly be well described by spinodal decomposition even in the case of a smooth ( but very fast ) crossover .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii reviews the theoretical methods we use to describe the nucleation process of an expanding system , including a brief presentation of the thin - wall approximation following a different reasoning , and discusses the dynamics in an expanding background plus the role of reheating .",
    "our numerical results are discussed in section iii , where we display the relevant bubble features , as well as the time evolution of the temperature and of the hadronic fraction , and analyze the process of reheating .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "thermodynamically , a phase transition happens when a given system shifts its state of equilibrium from one free energy minimum to another in response to the change of some critical thermodynamic parameter . in real transitions ,",
    "this shift between equilibrium states is often an essentially non - equilibrium process and , in principle , one has no hope to describe it using the machinery of equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "however , several natural systems exhibit phase transitions in which the system is trapped in a metastable state ( false vacuum ) for a long time before reaching the final equilibrium configuration ( true vacuum ) .",
    "this is certainly true in a strongly first - order scenario in which the time scale of supercooling ( superheating ) in a thermally - driven transition is not much faster than the typical reaction time of the system .",
    "a first - order phase transition occurs between non - contiguous states in the thermodynamic configuration space , and manifests itself as a discontinuity in the entropy .",
    "this latent heat is a consequence of an energy barrier that prevents the system to simply roll down to the true minimum .",
    "if this barrier is high ( characteristic of a strongly first - order transition ) , a statistically improbable fluctuation is required , and the system is held in a metastable state for an appreciable time interval .    a similar metastable behaviour sets in when the change in the critical parameter is fast as compared to the relaxation time of the system .",
    "this is the case of the hadronization of the qgp formed in high - energy heavy ion collisions , where the time scale of the expanding plasma is orders of magnitude shorter than the typical reaction time of the deconfined matter .",
    "it turns out that it can be impossible ( and immaterial ) to determine the `` real nature '' of the phase transition in this dynamical system since the quenched plasma does not have to follow a continuous path in the thermodynamic configuration space . assuming a weakly first - order scenario for the quark - hadron transition , we review in the next sections some theoretical tools used in the description of the decay of metastable states .",
    "the paramount example of metastability in a first - order transition is the supersaturated vapor in a gas - liquid mixture below the condensation temperature .",
    "the mixture is composed of bubbles of liquid suspended in the gas , the two phases separated by a definite surface .",
    "taking into account the surface energy of the partially developed phase , the notion of thermodynamic equilibrium can be extended in spite of the fact that the gas can not be in equilibrium with a fully developed liquid phase .",
    "since it takes energy to make a surface , small bubbles will not be energetically favorable , and will be constantly created and evaporated . on the other hand ,",
    "if a sufficiently large bubble is formed in the medium , it will tend to grow , eventually converting the entire system to the new phase .",
    "the mechanism of bubble nucleation can play an important role in a first - order phase transition .",
    "it ignores the initial stages of the development of bubbles , being an effective theory for semimacroscopic elements of volume .",
    "still , one may have a flavor of what really happens by studying the dynamics of the nucleated bubbles .",
    "the question of the formation of bubbles is extremely relevant , mainly when external agents play the role of nucleating centers , leading to a significant increase of the nucleation rate .",
    "this is actually what happens to most natural systems , and is known as heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "however , we will not consider this kind of nucleation mechanism , but one in which bubbles originate from intrinsic thermodynamic fluctuations : the mechanism of homogeneous nucleation .",
    "it is a more fundamental process for which there is a field theory which captures its basic features .",
    "most of the formalism is based on a series of papers written by langer in the late sixties @xcite , where the basic theoretical apparatus to describe the decay of a metastable state of a classical system interacting with a heat bath at temperature @xmath2 is proposed ( see also @xcite ) . in this approach ,",
    "stable and metastable phases appear as local minima of a smooth energy functional @xmath3 .",
    "based on a phenomenological droplet model , it is conjectured that , in going from one minimum to a neighbor one , the system is likely to pass across a saddle point which is a minimum of @xmath3 in all directions of functional space but one , the latter giving rise to the instability .",
    "this saddle point configuration plays the role of the critical bubble in the formalism .",
    "langer derived an equation of motion for the probability distribution of the system , and obtained a steady - state solution flowing across the saddle point , allowing for the calculation of a classical nucleation rate ( probability per unit time per unit volume that a critical bubble nucleates ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a prescribed analytic continuation of the free energy of the stable phase in the unbroken ( single - well ) version of the theory which becomes metastable after the analytic continuation .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is the negative eigenvalue of the fluctuation operator characterizing the instability of the saddle point configuration .",
    "the zero - temperature quantum field theoretic case , where transitions are exclusively due to quantum tunneling , was considered by coleman and callan in @xcite , and , when both quantum and thermal fluctuations act together , the decay rate is approximately given by ( [ decayrate1 ] ) , as proved by affleck @xcite in a quantum mechanical context .",
    "of course , the existence of a single direction of instability simplifies the extension of langer s formalism to quantum field theories , and direct applications were proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "a good description of the nucleation process relies on a suitable choice of the free energy functional governing the dynamics of the bubbles .",
    "the natural choice corresponds to deriving the free energy from a more fundamental theory .",
    "when this is not feasible , and this is the case for the full qcd lagrangian , one can resort to a phenomenological approach , imposing symmetry requirements , as will be discussed in the next section .      as customary",
    ", one can obtain information about the phase transition by studying the evolution of a scalar field @xmath7 which represents the order parameter .",
    "it is reasonable to assume spherical symmetry for nucleating bubbles , so that one defines a coarse - grained free energy functional of the form : @xmath8 \\;.\\ ] ] thus , the field @xmath7 evolves in space in the presence of an effective potential that can be parametrized in the form of a landau expansion around the equilibrium phases , i.e. @xmath9 the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the interpretation of the order parameter are determined by the scenario under consideration , namely the supercooled ( @xmath13 ) qgp .",
    "one should notice that , in this simple approach , the temperature enters only as a parameter of the effective potential .",
    "the potential ( [ effpot ] ) is suitable for a first - order phase transition due to the properties of its extrema .",
    "the order parameter configurations ( bubble profiles ) are solutions of the following euler - lagrange equation : @xmath14 the potential ( [ effpot ] ) has two minima , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which correspond to the equilibrium phases . here , @xmath15",
    "( @xmath16 ) corresponds to the quark ( hadron ) phase .",
    "there is a barrier separating @xmath15 and @xmath16 which can be associated with a latent heat , a jump in entropy from one phase to the other .",
    "in addition , one can prove that , as required by langer s formalism , this theory has a saddle - point solution , @xmath17 , connecting the two minima and with a single unstable direction @xcite .",
    "the minimum @xmath15 is conveniently chosen to be zero , while the other one is located at @xmath18 the transition temperature is reached when the pressure of the competing phases coincide .",
    "this condition sets a connection with thermodynamics through the identification @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the pressures of the quark ( deconfined ) phase and hadron phase , respectively .    in order to proceed with the study of the phase conversion from the deconfined state to hadrons",
    ", one has to fix the potential , either by connecting it to pressures computed for each phase , as described above , or by extracting the effective potential directly from some effective field theory , such as the linear sigma model as , for instance , in ref .",
    "we choose to follow the first procedure and , instead of using the mit bag model as usually done for simplicity , we profit from the currently more robust knowledge of the equation of state of qcd in the two different regimes ( partonic and hadronic ) which justifies the use of more realistic expressions for the pressure .",
    "concretely , we use lattice qcd results for @xmath22 quark flavors to describe the high - temperature sector @xcite , and a gas of over 250 free resonances for the hadronic phase @xcite .",
    "this yields a _",
    "weakly _ first - order deconfining transition , to be contrasted to the usual case of a strongly first - order transition as provided by the bag model , and the value of the critical temperature is automatically determined by the crossing of the high and low temperature pieces of the equation of state ( eos ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . for comparison",
    ", we also use the bag model for the quark phase in our calculations and discussion , choosing the bag constant according to the critical temperature obtained by the crossing of the pressure curves @xcite .",

    "this nontrivial behavior of @xmath131 suggests that the temperature in which @xmath131 reaches its maximum can be interpreted as a ( generous ) limit to the applicability of the thin - wall approximation .",
    "following the previous criterion , one can say that the thin - wall approximation fails for supercooling higher than @xmath139 .",

    "@xmath66 can be calculated either directly from ( [ freeenergy ] ) or , in a computationally faster way , by using the formula @xmath141 this expression resembles the thin - wall expression for @xmath66 , but here the temperature dependence of the surface tension makes this formula a good approximation to the exact value obtained using ( [ freeenergy ] ) , once the functions @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath131 are known .",
    "the different results to @xmath66 , calculated using a simple thin - wall ( where @xmath51 is a constant ) , using eq . ( [ eq : pseudothin - s3 ] ) ( which we call _ t - dependent thin - wall _ ) , and from eq . ( [ freeenergy ] ) , are shown in fig .",

    "we first analyze how the temperature evolves with time if we consider the reheating backreaction effects on the expanding system . as a first example",
    ", we consider three different expansion rates : @xmath144 fm / c ( fast ) , @xmath145 fm / c ( critical ) and @xmath146 fm / c ( slow ) . from fig . 6 we can see that in the first case the temperature drops so fast that the system reaches the spinodal temperature without having time to grow enough bubbles to reheat .",
    "this is an example of a _",
    "quench _ into the spinodal region .",
    "as the expansion rate @xmath117 is lowered , the growing bubbles eventually have time to effectively release enough latent heat .",
    "then , the cooling process is reversed and the temperature is raised to a value close to ( and lower than ) @xmath25 . in this way",
    "the phase transition is completed through bubble nucleation .",
    "when the whole plasma is hadronized , there is no more release of latent heat , the expansion once again dominates and the temperature falls abruptly . for the realistic equation of state we adopt , we find that the lowest ( critical ) expansion rate @xmath117 at which there is reheating corresponds approximately to @xmath147 fm / c . finally , we also consider a very low expansion and verify that the phase conversion proceeds almost entirely at @xmath24 , which is equivalent to having an almost _ in equilibrium _ phase conversion .",
    "notice , however , that , if we take a closer look at the temperature as a function of time , even for the slowest expansion rate there is a slight supercooling in the beginning of the phase transition ( as can be seen in the zoom for early times displayed in fig",
    ". 7 ) . in any case ,",
    "the slower the expansion rate , the closer to equilibrium the transition evolves .",
    "furthermore , the product @xmath148 is the same for all expansion rates .",
    "[ fig : reaq1ads ]    -0.25 cm , as a function of time , in units of @xmath149 , for different expansion rates.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    dissipation effects can generally affect significantly the dynamics of phase conversion , even in the case of an explosive spinodal decomposition @xcite .",
    "in our framework , viscosity enters as a parameter in the dynamical prefactor of the nucleation rate ( see eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) ) . recalling that",
    "the viscosity of the qgp is presumably very small @xcite and that , on the other hand , holographic models set a lower bound ( @xmath150 ) @xcite , we compare the dynamics of the phase conversion for two values of viscosity : @xmath151 and @xmath152 . fig .",
    "8 shows that by increasing the viscosity from @xmath151 to @xmath152 the supercooling decreases approximately by a factor of two , although the time to complete the transition remains unaffected .",
    "[ fig : reaq1ads_zoom ]    -0.25 cm , as a function of time , in units of @xmath149 , for different expansion rates at early times.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    the effects of different values of latent heat on the dynamics of the phase transition was also studied . in fig .",
    "9 , we show the time evolution of the temperature considering the two equations of state discussed in section [ effvandeos ] and an expansion rate @xmath147 fm / c .",

    "9 we can see that the eos provided by the bag model , which leads to a latent heat larger than the one produced by the mixed eos we adopt , implies a different transition dynamics .",
    "in fact , the larger latent heat of the bag eos leads to a faster reheating of the plasma , since each nucleated bubble releases much more latent heat .",
    "thus , a faster reheating means that the system will spend more time close to the critical temperature and the average nucleation rate will be much smaller for higher values of latent heat .",
    "therefore , as can be seen in the figure , the nucleation process will take much longer to be completed .",
    "[ fig : reaq600_1_latt_bag ]    -0.25 cm , as a function of time , in units of @xmath149 , for the mixed and the bag model equations of state with @xmath147 fm / c.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    we can now focus on the hadronic fraction of the plasma , i.e. , the fraction which has been hadronized via bubble nucleation up to time @xmath98 , @xmath93 . as can be easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : frac_t ] ) , @xmath93 depends very strongly on @xmath153 , another measure of the supercooling .",
    "in fact , for a small @xmath154 , when the thin - wall approximation is valid , @xmath155 \\approx \\frac{{\\cal p}_0}{2\\pi }                    \\exp{\\left[-\\frac{16\\pi\\sigma^3}{3\\ell^2 t_c\\tilde\\delta^2}\\right ] } \\;,\\ ] ] which depends very strongly on @xmath154 .",
    "this implies that @xmath93 will also grow exponentially as the temperature decreases , but before reheating effects are manifest .",
    "indeed , after reheating the fluid temperature is near @xmath25 and it is unlikely that new bubbles nucleate .",
    "this means that after reheating @xmath93 grows due to the expansion of the existing bubbles , i.e. in a much milder fashion than during the supercooling phase , as can be seen in fig .",
    "we also notice that , for a slow expansion , the first stage ( nucleation of new bubbles ) takes place very early , and almost all of the dynamics of phase conversion is due to the expansion of the bubbles .",
    "[ fig : fraction_t ]    -0.25 cm   fm / c ( critical expansion ) and for @xmath156 fm / c ( slow expansion).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    by examining both @xmath157 and @xmath93 on the same plot ( fig . 11 ) , one can see quite clearly the relation between the reheating and the growth of @xmath93 on one hand and , on the other hand , that after the reheating the temperature drops only after the phase transition is completed , i.e. , after the system reaches @xmath158 .",

    "a curious possibility is that of a double process phase conversion , in which the reheating takes the plasma back to some metastable temperature , in which nucleation dominates . as a result , part of the plasma is converted through spinodal decomposition and part by ( inhomogeneous ) nucleation",
    ". it would also be interesting to explore experimental consequences of such a hybrid transition process .",
    "using two different equations of state , a realistic matching of hadron gas of resonances and lattice qcd for @xmath159 on one side , and the bag model ( matched onto a hadron gas in the low temperature sector ) on the other , we calculated both static and dynamical features of homogeneous bubble nucleation in a weakly first - order quark - hadron transition scenario , which is physically appealing if one takes into account results from the lattice and from experiments , as well as the nonequilibrium nature of the phase conversion process , especially in the case of high - energy heavy ion collisions .    after setting up an effective potential , we obtained numerically bubble profiles , critical radii , the surface tension and the free energy as functions of the temperature .",
    "we also compared our numerical results to those derived in the thin - wall approximation .",
    "we showed how this approximation ( valid only near the critical temperature ) can be used to _ overestimate _ the nucleation rate for lower temperatures .",
    "this indicates that an adequate approach to the dynamics of nucleation away from @xmath25 should take into account exact bubble profiles @xmath160 , which in general have to be calculated numerically . with these",
    "_ static _ quantities we were able to feed a model for the dynamics of bubble nucleation in a homogeneously and isotropically expanding plasma , which is often adopted in studies of the early universe and heavy - ion collisions . within this model",
    ", the only essential difference between these two physical settings is the value of the inverse hubble constant @xmath161 , which is about @xmath162 fm / c in the early universe during the quark - hadron transition era , and about @xmath163 fm / c in the case of heavy - ion experiments .",
    "we computed the temperature and the fraction of hadronized plasma as functions of time for different expansion rates , @xmath117 , in order to make a quantitative estimate of the importance of nucleation in ( homogeneous and isotropic ) expanding systems .    in the scenario of a weakly first - order transition investigated in this paper ,",
    "it is clear that nucleation remains as the dominant mechanism of phase conversion in the early universe , as expected from the standard cosmological picture .",
    "nevertheless , previous estimates for relevant time scales using the bag model equation of state , which yields a much stronger first - order transition , may differ by a factor of two when compared to results from a more realistic equation of state . for high - energy heavy ion collisions , where the plasma expands very quickly , the main mechanism for phase conversion",
    "must be greatly dominated by spinodal decomposition , which possibly has some effect on particle correlations and fluctuation @xcite .",
