    "in the microelectronic industry , the continuous quest for devices with improved performance and lower power consumption has recently stimulated an intense research on dielectric materials .",
    "indeed , for over three decades , sio@xmath0 has formed the perfect gate dielectric material for metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors ( mosfets ) .",
    "however , fundamental limits have recently been reached that impede further downscaling of mosfets based on sio@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite candidate materials to substitute the latter are transition metal oxides and silicates with an high dielectric constant , specifically higher than sio@xmath0 , and are commonly referred to as _ high - k _ dielectrics . in this framework , zro@xmath0 and hfo@xmath0 , and more generally zr and hf compounds , have attracted considerable attention ,  @xcite hafnium - based microprocessors being now in development or even already in production .",
    "@xcite    _ ab - initio _ calculations can nicely complement the experimental work to investigate the properties of these novel materials ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) and to engineer the interfaces .",
    "@xcite the method of choice for investigating ground - state properties is density - functional theory ( dft ) that allows to treat quite large systems on the one hand , and to obtain reliable results on the other hand .",
    "@xcite for the si / zro@xmath0 and si / hfo@xmath0 interfaces , various models have been explored using dft .",
    "@xcite it was found that due to their analogous electronic structure , the two transition metal oxides present a very similar interfacial bonding .",
    "moreover , there is general agreement that the o - terminated interfaces are more stable than metal - terminated ones .",
    "one of the most stringent criteria in the design of si / oxide interfaces is their band offsets ( bos ) that control the transport properties , and hence the leakage current .",
    "@xcite in particular , both the valence and conduction band offsets ( vbo and cbo ) should be larger than 1ev to obtain a low leakage .",
    "dft relying on local or semilocal approximations for the exchange  correlation potential does not guarantee quantitatively correct bos since the dft eigenenergies do not correspond to the quasiparticle ( qp ) energies .",
    "@xcite however , the vbos are often found with an accuracy of a few tenths of ev , especially for semiconductor interfaces .",
    "@xcite therefore , the cbos can also be predicted using a simple scissor operator to correct the band gaps to their experimental values .",
    "several works have addressed the bos at the si / zro@xmath0 and si / hfo@xmath0 interfaces using this scissor - corrected dft scheme.@xcite the calculated vbos for the stable insulating o - terminated interfaces of si / zro@xmath0 and si / hfo@xmath0 are around 2.53ev , in reasonable agreement with the experiments ( 2.73.4ev ) .  @xcite the scissor - corrected cbos are about 1.72.2ev , and compare quite well with the experimental values ( 1.52ev ) .",
    "@xcite    in contrast with dft , the many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) within the @xmath1 approximation has proven to be a practical and sufficiently accurate method for calculating qp energies .",
    "@xcite in this method , the dft eigenenergies within the local density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) level are corrected perturbatively ( qp corrections ) to obtain the qp energies . for semiconductor interfaces ,",
    "the qp corrections on the band edges are often similar on both sides  @xcite and do not substantially affect the vbos , explaining the success of dft .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , this approach can not be generalized to other interfaces .",
    "for example , for the si / sio@xmath0 interface , the difference between the dft and the experimental vbo is larger than 1ev .",
    "recent accurate calculations have shown that the qp corrections account for this discrepancy ,  @xcite and hence they are essential to reproduce quantitatively the experimental measurements . for the si / zro@xmath0 interface , a correction of about 1.1ev has been extracted from @xmath1 calculations for si  @xcite and zro@xmath0  @xcite and used together with the experimental band gap to correct dft bos in several works .",
    "@xcite for the si / hfo@xmath0 interface , the same correction as for si / zro@xmath0 has been adopted  @xcite since there were no @xmath1 calculations available for hfo@xmath0 .",
    "such an assumption seems quite reasonable given the analogous electronic structure of zro@xmath0 and hfo@xmath0 .",
    "however , for both si / zro@xmath0 and si / hfo@xmath0 interfaces , the vbos obtained applying this correction are too large ( and as a consequence the cbos too small ) with respect to the available experiments .",
    "@xcite    in this work , the origin of this disagreement is discussed .",
    "qp calculations are performed for the thermodynamically stable phases ( cubic , tetragonal and monoclinic ) of hfo@xmath0 and zro@xmath0 as well for a strained tetragonal polymorph . in particular , we calculate the qp corrections at the top valence and bottom conduction bands in order to determine the fundamental band gaps and by comparison with si , the qp correction for the si / oxide band offsets .",
    "in contrast with previous qp calculations , our results show that the vbo remains almost unchanged while the cbo is corrected by 1.31.5ev , thus explaining the success of the scissor - corrected dft .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the methodological background is briefly described .",
    "iii is devoted to the presentation and discussion of our results : the dft geometries and band structures , the qp corrections to the band gaps , and finally the qp corrections to the si / oxide band offsets .",
    "the geometries and electronic structures for all the systems are computed within the dft .",
    "all the calculations are carried out with the abinit  @xcite code within the lda for the exchange  correlation energy functional .",
    "@xcite troullier - martins  @xcite norm conserving pseudopotentials are used which include semicore states in the pseudopotentials for zr and hf ( for details see refs .  ) .",
    "the wave functions are expanded on a plane - wave basis set up to kinetic energy cutoff of 12 ha for si and up to 30 ha for the hfo@xmath0 and zro@xmath0 polymorphs .",
    "for all systems , the brillouin zone ( bz ) is sampled with a 4@xmath24@xmath24 monkhorst ",
    "pack  @xcite grid .",
    "the qp energies are evaluated using the mbpt within the @xmath1 approximation . in this approach ,",
    "the dft eigenenergy @xmath3 and wavefunction @xmath4 for the @xmath5 state are used as a zeroth - order approximation for their quasiparticle counterparts .",
    "thus , the qp energy @xmath6 is calculated by adding to @xmath3 the first - oder perturbation correction that comes from replacing the dft exchange - correlation potential @xmath7 with the @xmath1 self - energy operator @xmath8 : @xmath9 the renormalization factor @xmath10 accounts for the fact that @xmath8 , which is energy dependent , should be evaluated at @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath1 self - energy operator @xmath8 writes as a convolution in frequency space between the one - electron green s function @xmath12 and the screened coulomb potential @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a positive infinitesimal .",
    "the explicit expression for the green s function @xmath12 is : @xmath16^ * } {   \\omega -e_n^{\\text{dft } } + i\\delta\\,\\text{sgn}(e_n^{\\text{dft } } - \\mu ) } , \\label{eq : greens}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the chemical potential .",
    "the screened coulomb potential is determined as convolution between the inverse of the dielectric function @xmath18 and the bare coulomb interaction : @xmath19 the dielectric function @xmath20 is calculated within the random phase approximation .",
    "its dependence on the frequency is approximated using the plasmon pole model ( ppm ) proposed by godby and needs .",
    "@xcite for the cubic zro@xmath0 , we explicitly test the validity of this choice . on the one hand , we perform the same calculation with the ppm proposed by hybertsen and louie .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , we take into account the full frequency dependence of the dielectric matrix without resorting to any ppm at all ,  @xcite in order to discriminate between the two ppms .    in our qp calculations , both @xmath12 [ eq .  ( [ eq : greens ] ) ] and @xmath13 [ eq .  ( [ eq : scrclb ] ) ]",
    "are first evaluated from the dft eigensolutions ( which is often referred to as @xmath21 ) .",
    "successively , the dft energies are self - consistently replaced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : greens ] ) by the corrected values obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : qpcrrct ] ) ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the qp corrections are evaluated only for a few valence and conduction bands around the gap , the other energies @xmath6 are extrapolated using a scissor operator .",
    "we find that 23 iterations are enough to converge the orbital energies up to 0.010.02ev .",
    "a systematic study  @xcite on several bulk systems has recently pointed out @xmath22 as a practical and accurate method for evaluating qp energies .",
    "indeed , while @xmath21 provides underestimated energies for almost all systems , @xmath22 shows a good agreement with both experimental data and full self - consistent @xmath1 including a bethe  salpeter - like vertex correction .",
    "@xcite    the @xmath1 calculations are performed with the yambo  @xcite code , except for the calculation of cubic zro@xmath0 with the ppm of hybertsen and louie ,  @xcite which is performed with the abinit code .",
    "we carefully study the convergence of the qp corrections with the numerical cutoffs : for si and the cubic polymorphs of hfo@xmath0 and zro@xmath0 , we include 200 bands in the calculations of the green s function [ eq .  ( [ eq : greens ] ) ] , and 200 bands and 331 reciprocal lattice vectors in the calculation of the dielectric matrix  @xcite in eq .  ( [ eq : scrclb ] ) .",
    "for the tetragonal polymorphs ( strained and at equilibrium ) , we include 500 bands in the calculations of the green s function , and 300 bands and 735 reciprocal lattice vectors in the calculation of the dielectric matrix .",
    "finally , the monoclinic polymorphs requires 600 bands for the green s function , and 400 bands and 1177 reciprocal lattice vectors for the dielectric matrix . with these parameters ,",
    "we estimate an error on the qp energies of about 0.050.1ev depending on the system .",
    "for both zro@xmath0 and hfo@xmath0 , the three thermodynamically stable phases ( cubic [ c ] , tetragonal [ t ] , and monoclinic [ m ] ) are investigated .",
    "in addition , a strained [ s ] form of the tetragonal polymorph is also considered in which two sides are fixed to @xmath23 ( @xmath24=5.40   is the lda theoretical lattice constant of si ) while all other degrees of freedom are relaxed .",
    "this last structure aims at simulating the effect of the epitaxial strain on the oxide in the mosfet device .",
    "the calculated equilibrium parameters describing these four geometries are reported in table  [ tb : geores ] .",
    "our results agree within 12% with previous lda  @xcite and gga  @xcite results , as well as with experimental data .",
    "@xcite for the strained polymorphs ( s - zro@xmath0 and s - hfo@xmath0 ) , a contraction is observed along the tetragonal direction @xmath25 of about 2% compared to their fully relaxed tetragonal analogs ( t - zro@xmath0 and t - hfo@xmath0 ) .",
    "this is a direct consequence of fixing the lattice constant @xmath26 in the basal plane ( in fact , @xmath26 is expanded by 7% and 5% in s - zro@xmath0 and s - hfo@xmath0 , respectively ) . as an indirect consequence ,",
    "the internal parameter @xmath27 becomes larger in the strained forms .",
    "for the latter structure , no direct meaningful comparison is possible with previous works in which epitaxial strained tetragonal polymorphs are also considered ,  @xcite since these rely on the gga value for si lattice constant .",
    ".structural parameters of the thermodynamically stable phases ( cubic [ c ] , tetragonal [ t ] , and monoclinic [ m ] ) and of the strained [ s ] tetragonal structure ( see text ) of zro@xmath0 and hfo@xmath0 .",
    "the lattice constants ( @xmath26 , @xmath28 , and @xmath25 ) are in expressed in  , while the angle @xmath29 ( between @xmath26 and @xmath28 ) is given in degrees . for the tetragonal and strained forms ,",
    "the internal parameter @xmath27 is the displacement of the oxygen atoms with respect to their ideal cubic position in units of the lattice vector @xmath25 . for the monoclinic polymorph , the internal coordinates for the metal ( @xmath30=zr or hf ) and the two oxygen ( o@xmath31 and o@xmath0 )",

    "the qp correction to the band gap , which is  1.9ev in the three thermodynamically stable phase , is 0.4ev lower than the value previously obtained in ref .   for the cubic phase .",
    "this variation can be attributed to the different ppm ( by hybertsen louie  @xcite ) used by the authors in the frequency integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scrclb ] ) . indeed , by repeating our calculation for the cubic phase with the same ppm , the qp correction to the band gap increases up to 2.4ev in good agreement with ref .  .",
    "in order to discriminate between the two ppms , the calculation is also repeated without resorting to any ppm . the qp correction is found to be 2.1ev , which is 0.2ev higher than the value obtained with the godby and needs ppm , and 0.3ev lower than the one obtained with the hybertsen and louie ppm .",
    "it can be argued that our qp corrections to the band gap and hence the resulting qp band gaps are probably also underestimated for the other polymorphs of zro@xmath0 and for hfo@xmath0 due to the use of the ppm .",
    "thus , when comparing the results with the experiments or other theoretical work , this extra uncertainty of about 0.2ev should also be taken into account .",
    "our calculated qp band gaps for c- , t- , and m - zro@xmath0 , also show an overall agreement with those of ref .   relying on the screened - exchange lda method .",
    "this confirms the validity of this approximation for the calculation of band structures . for hfo@xmath0 ,",
    "our result for the cubic phase agrees well with the @xmath1 band gap reported in ref .  , while for the tetragonal and monoclinic phase our values are larger by 0.2ev .    experimentally , the optical band gaps determined from energy loss and transmission spectroscopies range from 5.2 to 5.7ev for zro@xmath0  @xcite and from 5.3 to 5.8ev for hfo@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite hence , the agreement between our calculations of the fundamental gap and experimental results is quite reasonable considering the temperature , excitonic , and impurities effects and the possible substrate strain in case of deposited films that should be taken into account . for the thermodynamically stable phases of zro@xmath0 , reflectance vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy",
    "indicate 6.17.1ev , 5.86.6ev , and 5.87.1ev for the cubic , tetragonal , and monoclinic phases , respectively . for the last two , our calculated values fall into the range of the experimental estimates .",
    "in contrast , for the cubic phase , our band gap is much lower even when considering the minimum direct band gap ( 5.5ev at x ) and when taking into account the underestimation by 0.2ev coming from the ppm .",
    "this discrepancy may be related to the yttrium used to stabilize the cubic phase at room temperature and/or the tendency of reflectance measurements to overestimate the gap ( see ref .   for a thorough discussion ) . for hfo@xmath0 , a `` theoretical '' band gap of 6.7ev  @xcite was proposed for a film deposited on a sio@xmath32n@xmath33/@xmath34-si substrate ( monoclinic phase ) by comparing direct / inverse photoemission spectroscopy with dft density - of - states calculations , arguing that the reduction of 0.9ev with respect to the experimental band gap ( 5.9ev ) should be attributed to defects tail states . our value compares better with the band gap determined directly from the experiment .      in the dft approach , the vbo and cbo",

    "@xcite for the stable insulating o - terminated interfaces of si / zro@xmath0 and si / hfo@xmath0 , the vbos calculated are found to range from 2.5 to 3ev , in good agreement with the experimental findings ( 2.73.4ev ) .",

    "( [ eq : cbo_scissor ] ) , the scissor - corrected cbos lie thus between 1.7 and 2.2ev .",
    "this is also in good agreement with experiments ( 1.52.0ev ) .",
    "@xcite    in the qp framework , it was often assumed  @xcite and it has recently been proven  @xcite that the lineup of the potential @xmath38 is already well - described within dft . so that , only the band - structure contribution is modified : @xmath44 where @xmath45 ( resp .",
    "@xmath46 ) is the quasiparticle correction at the vbm ( resp .",

    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite evaluated the qp effects on the vbo of si / zro@xmath0 combining the value for tetragonal zro@xmath0 ( @xmath49=@xmath501.23ev ) from ref .   with the value for si from ref .",

    "the vbos obtained in this way were found to be too large ( and as a consequence the cbos too small ) with respect to the experimental values .",
    "@xcite    for the oxides , our qp corrections to the dft valence band @xmath49 vary from @xmath500.3 to @xmath500.5ev ; while for the conductions bands , @xmath53 ranges from 1.4 to 1.7ev . for si , our qp corrections , which are reported in table  [ tb : allmqp ] ,",
    "lead to a band gap that agrees well with previous theoretical works ( e.g. see ref .  ) , and with the experimental value .",
    "@xcite the total qp correction to the gap @xmath54 of about 0.7ev , comes mostly from the downshift of valence band state ( @xmath49=@xmath500.6ev ) .",
    "this @xmath49 value is almost the same as that found for the polymorphs of both zro@xmath0 and hfo@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the qp correction on the vbos are only of 0.1 - 0.2ev and the correction on the cbos is about 1.31.5ev .",
    "this explains why previous studies based on scissor - corrected dft were in such a good agreement with experimental results .",
    "turning to previous works  @xcite that accounted for qp corrections to the bos of si / zro@xmath0 and si / hfo@xmath0 interfaces using values from prior @xmath1 calculations ,  @xcite their disagreement with experiments can be explained as follows .",
    "on the one hand , the qp corrections in the oxide and si are not consistent since a different approximation has been used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scrclb ] ) for the dielectric function @xmath20 .",
    "the calculations for si use a model dielectric function ,  @xcite while the calculations for zro@xmath0 use the random phase approximation . in particular , the value obtained for si @xmath49=@xmath500.2ev is lower in absolute value with respect to the value found from the random phase approximation ( @xmath49=@xmath500.6ev ) , and hence this inconsistency artificially increases the qp correction on the vbo . on the other hand , our qp results ( in particular , those for c- and t - zro@xmath0 ) differ from those obtained in ref .   where it was found that the total qp correction @xmath54=2.3ev resulted from lowering the valence bands by about 1.3ev , and raising the conduction band by about 1.1ev .",
    "the difference with our results is due again to the different ppm used . indeed , repeating the calculations with the hybertsen and louie ppm for the cubic phase , we found a correction @xmath49 of @xmath501.1ev for the valence and @xmath53 of @xmath551.3ev for the conduction in agreement with ref .  .",
    "when performing the same calculation without resorting to any ppm , we obtain @xmath49=@xmath500.7ev and @xmath53=1.4ev , meaning that @xmath49 is 0.2ev too low for the godby and needs ppm , and 0.5ev too high for the hybertsen and louie ppm . for the conduction bands ,",
    "@xmath53 differs by less than 0.1ev with the former , while it is 0.3ev too low with the latter .    as final remark",
    ", we stress that rigorously , the qp corrections on the band offsets should be calculated using the same pseudopotential and the same exchange - correlation approximation as for the interface calculations .",
    "indeed , while the @xmath1 band gap has been demonstrated to be quite insensitive to the starting point , this is not true for the qp corrections that reflect  as a consequence  the differences in the choice of the pseudopotential and the exchange - correlation approximation .",
    "therefore , we would recommend to calculate  when possible  qp corrections on dft band offsets using the same pseudopotentials , and exchange - correlation approximation as for the interface calculation and using the same ppm for both materials .",
    "the electronic properties of zro@xmath0 and hfo@xmath0 polymorphs and their interface with si have been investigated using @xmath1 calculations .",
    "the qp corrections are found to be very similar for the two oxides consistently with their analogous band structure , and depend only slightly on the crystalline structure . while , at the dft level , the epitaxial strain was found to dramatically shrink the band gap ( especially for zro@xmath0 for which the lattice parameter mismatch with si is larger ) , the qp corrections depend only slightly on the strain . when considering the interface si / oxide , the qp corrections to the vbos",
    "were calculated to be very small ( a few tenths of ev ) by cancellation of the corrections on the valence band maximum of the si and those of oxides . on the other hand ,",
    "the correction was found to be of the order of 1.5ev for the cbos .",
    "these results disagree with the correction on the vbos of more than 1ev used in the literature,@xcite which was extracted from existing @xmath1 calculations .",
    "@xcite we have traced back the differences with our results to the difference in the ppm used for the zro@xmath0 , and to the inconsistence in the level of approximation for the screened interaction @xmath13 .",
