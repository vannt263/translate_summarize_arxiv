    "high harmonic generation can be used for attosecond imaging of molecules @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the structure of an aligned molecule can be inferred from quantum - interference patterns , which appear in the high - harmonic spectra",
    ". understood in terms of the three - step model , in which an electron reaches the continuum by tunneling or multiphoton ionization , is accelerated by the field and subsequently recombines with a bound state of its parent molecule , emitting a high - order harmonic photon @xcite , this phenomenon occurs due to the electron returning to different spatially separated centers .",
    "the simplest scenario is high - harmonic generation in a diatomic molecule , for which , in principle , recombination and thus high - harmonic emission can take place from either atomic center .",
    "this is a microscopic equivalent to the double slit experiment doubleslit .    how to accurately describe the whole process of high harmonic generation ( hhg ) in molecules is still an open problem .",
    "there are two main theoretical approaches that can be used .",
    "firstly one can attempt a fully numerical solution by using density functional theory , which gives accurate results but inhibits a more complete understanding of the process @xcite .",
    "secondly , one can employ the traditional atomic three step model , within the strong - field approximation @xcite , and calculate the molecular bound - state wavefunctions using a quantum chemistry code @xcite .",
    "in this framework , the bound states of the molecule are mainly incorporated in the ionization and recombination steps , in the form of prefactors .",
    "the latter approach allows a better physical understanding of the problem . the price one pays , however , is that , in order to be able to treat hhg within a semi - analytical framework , several approximations must be made .",
    "it is well known that the harmonic spectrum is proportional to the modulus squared of the fourier transform of the dipole acceleration . by using the ehrenfest theorem",
    "the dipole acceleration can be replaced by the dipole velocity or the dipole length , with no loss of accuracy so long as the integration is over all time and no physical approximations are made upon all wavefunctions involved .",
    "however , when the sfa is used , this is no longer the case , and replacement of the dipole operator gives rise to inconsistencies in the sfa dipole matrix elements , which vary depending on the form of the operator used .",
    "the most well known of these is the lack of translational invariance when using the length form of the dipole operator . in the single - active electron approximation",
    ", it has been shown that the velocity form gives the most reliable results @xcite and is easier to use than the acceleration form .    in calculating the sfa",
    "prefactors the simplest approach is to use the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) @xcite .",
    "however , the problems that arise in this case are 1 ) which orbitals have the predominant influence on high harmonic generation and 2 ) how to accurately include the multielectron effects of electron exchange and correlation .",
    "the first problem has to some extent been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite by noting that the ionization potential of different orbitals varies with the rotation of the molecule and hence the corresponding cutoffs in the high harmonic spectra will be different .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry of the orbital will strongly affect the contribution of specific orbitals to high - order harmonic spectra .",
    "this is particularly true as the alignment angle of the molecule with respect to the laser - field polarization varies . in previous work @xcite",
    "we also investigated high - order harmonic generation beyond the single - active orbital approximation .",
    "in particular , we addressed the quantum interference between the homo and the homo-1 of @xmath1 and the homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of @xmath2 .",
    "for the latter case , we have also observed that electron recombination to different orbitals can be mapped into different cutoffs in the hhg spectra .",
    "our investigations , however , did not incorporate electron correlation .",
    "in fact , we have either dealt with simplified multielectron models , in which the time evolution of the optically active electrons has been decoupled , or with a coherent superposition of one - electron states .",
    "the second problem is what we propose to investigate in this paper and in doing so to consider the influence that these multielectron effects have on high harmonic generation . in particular , we wish to incorporate such effects perturbatively around the contributions of the highest occupied molecular orbital .",
    "although correlation in molecular high - order harmonic generation has been addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite , utilizing a multielectron version of the strong - field approximation , such studies have been performed numerically to a great extent . including the correlation analytically in the dipole matrix elements facilitates more insight into the effects that correlation has on the high harmonic spectra . in ref .",
    "santra , many - body perturbation theory was used to include electron correlation as corrections to the standard three step model .",
    "therein , however , only the response of single atoms has been addressed .    from the viewpoint of",
    "which form of the dipole operator to use , we are particularly interested in how such corrections are affected by the different formulations , especially in molecular targets .",
    "indeed , even in the single - active electron approximation , the discrepant results obtained for each dipole form have raised considerable debate . by extending the debate to multielectron effects in molecules , more insight into",
    "which operator is most accurate for harmonic generation , and indeed all strong field phenomena , is gained .",
    "the use of molecules is beneficial because the two - center interference pattern gives another indicator of how the formulation is performing .    in order to make such an assessment",
    ", we will employ many - body perturbation theory along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite and the dipole moment in its length and velocity forms . for that purpose , we will consider two isoelectronic molecules : @xmath1 and co@xmath3 the homo , lumo and homo-1 in both molecules have similar geometry . the main difference between them is that @xmath1 is a homonuclear molecule , while co is heteronuclear .",
    "this means that , for the latter molecule , there is an intrinsic static dipole moment .",

    "a comparison of panels ( a ) and ( b ) shows that the two - center minimum is slightly displaced , depending on the form of the dipole operator .",
    "for instance , for vanishing alignment angle , in the velocity form this minimum is near @xmath182 , while in the length form it is at a slightly higher energy ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath184 mixing , which determines the energy position of this minimum , is different for each case .",

    "this behavior occurs both for the length and the velocity form of the dipole operator , and is due to the fact that the corrections are considerably smaller both in the ionization and recombination prefactor .",
    "the above - mentioned suppression of ionization for the @xmath187 orbitals also contributes to such results .",

    "[ cutsover ] .",
    "therein , we present spectra computed for a fixed alignment angle assuming @xmath188 to be constant and equal to unity .",

    "the figure shows that , while the overall spectra changes relatively little , or may even increase if this prefactor is removed ( see orange and black lines in fig .",
    "[ cutsover].(a ) ) , the corrections increase in several orders of magnitude .",
    "this can be attributed to the following . in the parameter range of interest , the zeroth order ionization prefactor , which is the main influence in the overall spectra , is of the order of unity or even slightly larger for a @xmath181 orbital .",

    "the figure shows the overall spectra together with the first - order corrections taking into account only the direct or overlap integrals .",

    "[ cutsover ] is the influence of the so - called overlap integrals , in which the dipole operator couples wavefunctions at different centers in the molecule , in the multielectron corrections . in general",

    "hence , in many cases the overlap integrals are neglected .",
    "we have verified , however , that this depends strongly on the form of the dipole operator .",
    "for the velocity - form dipole , the spectra obtained from the overlap integrals are comparable to those obtained from the direct integrals only [ fig .  [ cutsover].(a ) ] .",

    "in contrast , if the length form is considered , the contributions from the overlap integrals are considerably smaller than their direct - integral counterparts [ fig .  [ cutsover].(b ) ] .",
    "therefore , the former may be neglected .",
    "next , we will discuss the spectra encountered for co. the overall spectra are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figco ] , together with the first - order corrections ( upper and lower panels , respectively ) . as an overall feature , the spectra exhibit no perceivable two - center interference minimum , as co is a heteronuclear molecule .",
    "this means that , upon recombination , there will be more high - order harmonic emission from a specific spatial region , where the orbital with which the electron recombines , i.e. , the homo , is more localized .",
    "this occurs both for the velocity and length forms ( figs .",
    "[ figco].(a ) and ( b ) , respectively ) .",
    "one notices , however , that the decrease in the overall yield as the molecular alignment angle approaches @xmath189 remains , due to the fact that the homo is a @xmath193 orbital , and thus highly localized along the internuclear axis . as the laser - field polarization direction moves away from this axis , recombination , and hence high - order harmonic emission becomes less and less probable .",
    "due , however , to the heteronuclear nature of this molecule , this suppression occurs at a different angle compared to @xmath0 .",
    "once more , we find that the contributions of the first - order multielectron corrections to the spectra are several orders of magnitude smaller than the zeroth - order terms .",
    "these contributions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figco].(c ) and ( d ) , for the length and velocity form , respectively . for such corrections , the interference minimum due to high - harmonic emission at different centers has been washed out .",
    "this minimum was very clear for @xmath0 ( see figs .",
    "[ n2ionrec].(c ) and ( d ) for comparison ) .",
    "there is , however , a very pronounced minimum near @xmath194 for the velocity - form corrections , which is independent of the harmonic frequency ( see fig .",
    "[ figco].(d ) ) . this minimum is due to the geometry of the three lower - lying @xmath193 orbitals , which influence the corrections .",
    "this suggests that the imprints on the high - order harmonic spectra due to purely geometric features , such as nodal planes or minima in the orbitals , are more robust than those related to quantum interference between harmonics emitted as spatially separated centers .",
    "the length - form corrections , in contrast , do not exhibit any such feature .",
    "in fact , we have verified that they are dominated by the static dipole moment , which behaves in the same way as the homo .",
    "below , in fig .",
    "[ cutsco ] , we perform a more detailed analysis of the above - mentioned issue . for that purpose , we consider the contributions of individual orbitals to the corrections , and their influence on the harmonic spectra , for fixed harmonic order .",
    "we consider a mid - plateau harmonic , namely @xmath195 .",
    "these results are displayed for both @xmath0 and co , as functions of the alignment angle ( upper and lower panels in the figure , respectively ) . as an overall feature",
    ", we observe that , for a homonuclear molecule , all contributions are symmetric upon @xmath196 ( see panels(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "physically , this is expected , as such molecules exhibit inversion symmetry and a rotation of @xmath187 should not alter the physics of the problem .",
    "clearly , this no longer holds for a heteronuclear molecule . in this latter case , however , the contribution of @xmath197 to the yield is the mirror image of @xmath198 .",
    "this is clear , as in this case the right and the left ions are reversed .",
    "harmonic of a field with the same parameters as in the previous figures , as functions of the alignment angle @xmath180 of the molecule relative to the laser - field polarization .",
    "the thick black lines in the panel give the overall contributions of all @xmath193 orbitals and the orange stars the contributions of the @xmath187 orbitals , respectively .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) refer to @xmath0 , and panels ( c ) and ( d ) correspond to co , respectively .",
    "the left and right panels display the results using the length and velocity form of the dipole operator , respectively .",
    "the minima due to the two - center interference are indicated by green arrows in the figure .",
    ", width=359 ]    the individual contributions provide useful information about the geometry of the orbitals involved in the corrections .",
    "this can be seen in all cases , regardless of whether the molecule is heteronuclear or homonuclear .",
    "for instance , the contributions from the @xmath187 orbitals , shown as the orange symbols in the figure , decay very abruptly for @xmath199 .",
    "this is due to the fact that such orbitals exhibit nodal planes in the case of @xmath0 and a feature similar to nodal planes in the case of co. the main difference between the homonuclear and the heteronuclear case is the two - center interference minimum , which is absent in the heteronuclear case .",
    "furthermore , the shapes of such distributions do not change with the form of the dipole operator .",
    "any changes are mostly quantitative ( for a comparison , see panels ( a ) and ( b ) for @xmath0 and panels ( c ) and ( d ) for co )",
    ".    the contributions from the @xmath193 orbitals , on the other hand , can behave in very different ways depending on whether the velocity or the length form is taken , in the heteronuclear case , such as co. for @xmath0 , in contrast , different forms of the dipole operator will mainly lead to a different weighting of the contributions from individual orbitals to the overall corrections .",
    "for instance , in the length - form case , the contributions of the @xmath200 orbital are prevalent , while if the velocity form is taken , the contributions from both @xmath185 orbitals are comparable .",
    "another interesting feature is that both forms lead to a sharp harmonic suppression near @xmath201 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the nodal planes of the @xmath202 and @xmath200 orbitals are parallel to the laser - field polarization for such angles .    in co , however , we notice two interesting features .",
    "firstly , the nodes disappear if the length form is taken .",
    "this is partly due to the static dipole moment , which is only present in the length form and leads to corrections which behave like the homo .",
    "this implies that the overall dipole will decrease for @xmath203 as shown in the figure .",
    "in contrast , in the velocity form , as this term is absent , there are minima near @xmath192 .",
    "these minima come from the geometry of @xmath204 and @xmath205 , which are the heteronuclear counterparts of @xmath202 and @xmath200 , leading to a strong suppression in the yield close to @xmath201 .",
    "they are , however , slightly shifted from these values due to the heteronuclear character of the molecule .",
    "the remaining @xmath193 orbitals shift these minima even further , to @xmath206 .",
    "in conclusion , our results show that an adequate choice of the dipole operator in order to model high - order harmonic generation is still an open question . in the single - active - electron approximation ,",
    "enough evidence has been provided in @xcite that the velocity form yields the best agreement with the double - slit physical picture .",
    "if one goes beyond this approximation , however , the velocity form leads to a vanishing static dipole moment for heteronuclear molecules .",
    "this may be a particularity of the basis set involved .",
    "another issue in the velocity form are the so - called overlap integrals , in which the dipole operator couples wavefunctions localized at different ions in the molecule . throughout the literature",
    ", it has been argued that such integrals are small and may be neglected without loss of information .",
    "our results , however , indicate that , depending on the basis set used , their outcome may be comparable to that of the direct integrals , in which wavefunctions at the same ion are coupled . as the internuclear distance increases ,",
    "however , the overlap integrals become vanishing small .    in contrast",
    ", the length - form of the dipole operator leads to a non - vanishing static dipole moment for a heteronuclear molecule , and very small overlap integrals , in comparison to their direct counterparts .",
    "the main problem , however , is that such a formulation leads to terms in the dipole - matrix elements with increase indefinitely with the internuclear separation .",
    "they also couple states with the same parity , which is unphysical for an odd operator such as the dipole .",
    "such terms have been also found in the single - active electron context @xcite .",
    "hence , it seems that the velocity form still gives better results .",
    "furthermore , suppression of the harmonic spectra caused by the presence of nodes in the orbitals is far more robust than the maxima and minima coming from two - center interference .",
    "interestingly , for heteronuclear molecules , despite interference minima being washed out , the high - harmonic suppression caused by the geometry of the orbitals is still present in the spectra .",
    "however , compared to their homonuclear counterpart , this suppression occurs at different alignment angles .",
    "finally , in order to incorporate multielectron effects in sfa - like models in an appropriate way , one must consider the dynamics of the target .",
    "concrete examples are excitation , relaxation , electron orbits starting or finishing at different molecular orbitals , or the motion of the bound electrons .",
    "this paper has shown that , if multielectron effects are considered statically by employing many - body perturbation theory around the single - electron strong - field approximation , they lead to corrections which are several orders of magnitude smaller than the zeroth - order spectrum .",
    "this holds for both homonuclear and heteronuclear molecules .",

    "<S> we find that the velocity form incorrectly finds zero static dipole moment in heteronuclear molecules . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the length form of the dipole operator leads to the physically expected non - vanishing expectation value for the dipole operator in this case . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the so called `` overlap '' integrals , in which the dipole matrix element is computed using wavefunctions at different centers in the molecule , are prominent in the first - order multielectron corrections for the velocity form , and should not be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> finally , inclusion of the multielectron corrections has very little effect on the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that relaxation , excitation and the dynamic motion of the core are important in order to describe multielectron effects in molecular high - order high harmonic generation . </S>"
