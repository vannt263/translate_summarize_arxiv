    "in fig .  [ fig : pueg](a ) we show the self - consistent profile of @xmath33 across the qshi - sc interface for a few representative values of @xmath17 and @xmath27 .",
    "as seen , there is a depletion of cooper pairs , or inverse proximity effect , on the sc side of the junction with the accompanied leakage of pairs , or proximity effect , into the qshi .",
    "the spread in @xmath33 on the qshi side is essentially the same as the spread of the qshi edge state , whereas the depletion region is a few unit cells wide on the sc side .",
    "as can be expected , the proximity effect is larger for larger @xmath27 , whereas , perhaps more surprisingly , there is very little dependence on the qshi doping level @xmath17  for small to moderately large tunneling amplitudes .",
    "only a self - consistent approach can capture the inverse proximity effect and in fig .",
    "[ fig : pueg](b ) we plot the value of @xmath22 on the first sc site , s1 , as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "as seen , this value is significantly lower than @xmath34(bulk ) ( dashed line ) . we also in ( b ) plot the extracted superconducting gap in the qshi edge state , @xmath35(i1 ) .",
    "the self - consistent values of @xmath35 are shown with a solid line whereas non - self - consistent results , using a step - function of @xmath34(bulk ) at the interface , are shown with crosses and , as seen , they are essentially identical . therefore , self - consistency is _ not _ important for calculating the induced superconducting gap at the edge of a qshi from an @xmath0-wave  sc .",
    "this is in contrast to a @xmath2-wave  sc where self - consistency is crucial as we will discuss below .",
    "we also see that @xmath35(i1 ) , in general , increases with @xmath17  for all experimentally relevant @xmath27 .",
    "the slight downturn at small @xmath17  is due to the fact that for a highly transparent interface the sc induces a slight electron doping in the qshi edge state whereas the ( positive ) applied chemical potential @xmath17  creates an overall hole doping .",
    "we note especially that even for the highest @xmath17 we can achieve and still have a bulk gap , i.e.  @xmath36 , @xmath35(i1 ) is always finite .",
    "this is in contradiction to the prediction by stanescu _",
    "@xcite for a 3d ti .",
    "while @xmath1-wave  components are induced at the interface as we show below , we attribute the non - zero @xmath35 to the fact that the @xmath0-wave  component @xmath33 on site i1 is always finite for any @xmath17 , and thus @xmath35 is set by this value of @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , in the inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : pueg](a ) we show on a linear relation between @xmath33 and @xmath35 on site i1 , where the linear relation is independent of both @xmath17  and @xmath27 . to describe processes _ along _ the qshi edge",
    ", it is therefore possible to use a model where the effect of the sc is only taken into account through an effective @xmath37 for the edge state , where the effective pairing potential @xmath38 is independent of both @xmath17  and @xmath27 .",
    "such an effective model has been completely dominating in the literature @xcite , and our calculations provide a fully self - consistent evidence for the validity of this approach .",
    "as established by fu and kane @xcite , the low - energy spectrum in a 3d ti with an @xmath0-wave  superconducting order parameter resembles that of a spinless @xmath3-wave sc in momentum space , although time - reversal symmetry is not broken .",
    "however , in the present case of a 2d qshi with a 1d edge , any odd - in - momentum component necessarily only has a simple @xmath1-wave  symmetry .",
    "even though this @xmath1-wave  symmetry is intimately linked to the generation of majorana fermions , no detailed study has yet appeared on its origins .",
    "@xcite very recently predicted , after some rather restrictive approximations , that the @xmath1-wave component is directly proportional to @xmath39 , but no detailed calculations were preformed .",
    "here we explicitly calculate both on - site and bond superconducting order parameters that are odd in momentum , or @xmath1-wave .",
    "since the @xmath0-wave state in the sc is induced through a local pairing and the qshi edge state is extremely localized at the interface , all significant @xmath1-wave  pairing amplitudes should be captured within these two , locally defined , quantities .",
    "we start by defining the momentum - resolved on - site pairing amplitude @xmath40 .",
    "the conventional on - site order parameter can then be written as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number of @xmath43-points .",
    "obviously , only the part of @xmath44 that is even in @xmath43 contributes to @xmath33 .",
    "there can also , technically , be a term in @xmath44 that is _ odd _ in @xmath43 , which we will call @xmath45 . for @xmath46",
    "this odd component is zero , but on the edge of a qshi it is finite .",
    "we can understand this odd component better by defining the _ spinless on - site _",
    "operator @xmath47 ) at the qshi edge .",
    "then the cooper pair amplitude @xmath48 , due to the explicit coupling of spin and momentum at the edge of a qshi .",
    "thus , @xmath49 is nothing else than a spinless on - site @xmath1-wave pairing amplitude . in fig .",
    "[ fig : podd](a ) we show the spatial extent of @xmath50 for a prototypical interface . we see that @xmath50 peaks at site i1 but that it is also present on site s1 , and that there is a sign change between the two sites .",
    "this sign change interestingly also encodes an odd character _ across _ the interface , and we speculate that this might be a 1d manifestation of the @xmath51-wave present on the surface of 3d tis . fig .",
    "[ fig : podd](b ) furthermore shows that @xmath50 increases approximately linearly with @xmath17 , with @xmath27  determining the slope .",
    "since @xmath50 changes sign with @xmath17 , the finite charge transfer between the qshi and the sc discussed above makes @xmath50 slightly negative for small positive ( bulk ) @xmath17  at , especially , large @xmath27 .    without",
    "this charge transfer @xmath50 is zero at @xmath52 .",
    "this can also be seen from the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : podd](a ) , where we plot the @xmath43-dependence of the @xmath1-wave  order parameters .",
    "@xmath45 peaks sharply at the @xmath43 value where we find the qshi edge dirac cone in the bogoliubov spectrum . since this cone is at @xmath53 when @xmath52 , time reversal symmetry will then force @xmath50 to vanish @xcite .",
    "we also note that for all small to moderately large tunneling amplitudes @xmath50 is linear in @xmath27 , which is also different from the earlier prediction of @xmath54 behavior @xcite .",
    "we also note that @xmath55 for all @xmath17  and @xmath27 .",
    "this further supports our earlier conclusion that the induced @xmath1-wave  state will never close the superconducting gap in the qshi , even at high doping levels .",
    "we also study the cooper pair amplitude on nearest neighbor bonds , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 labels the bonds as defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . a small , but finite ,",
    "@xmath58 exists at the qshi - sc interface , but its value is largely independent on @xmath6 .",
    "thus this ( even ) order parameter is not a consequence of the topological nature of the qshi but it is a property of the surface of the sc .",
    "however , by using the same momentum - resolved technique presented above for @xmath33 , we can also define an odd - in - momentum component @xmath59 , which is only non - zero for finite @xmath6 .",
    "we find that especially @xmath60(i1 ) , which resides on the @xmath27  bond , is large .",
    "this could have been expected , since the qshi edge state leaks substantially into the sc . furthermore , we find that @xmath59 increases approximately linearly with @xmath27  but that it is essentially _ independent _ on @xmath17 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : podd ] .",
    "previous work @xcite has established a finite @xmath1-wave  order parameter at high doping levels , but our results explicitly show that there also exists a finite induced @xmath1-wave  order parameter at @xmath52 .",
    "this is despite time - reversal symmetry dictating that @xmath61 at @xmath53 for half - filling .",
    "the finite @xmath59 is still possible due to a rather broad @xmath43-dependence , as seen in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : podd](a ) . to further analyze @xmath59",
    "we define the _ spinless bond _ operator @xmath62 $ ] , where @xmath8 is on the i1 site and b is on the s1 site",
    ". then we can construct the spinless cooper pair amplitude residing on the @xmath27  bond as @xmath63 \\equiv f_{j}^o$ ] .",
    "since @xmath50 at sites i1 and s1 have different signs , @xmath60(i1 ) contributes crucially to this spinless @xmath1-wave  bond order parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig : podd](b ) wee see that @xmath64 increases moderately with @xmath27 , similar to @xmath65 and @xmath50 , but , contrary to @xmath50 , it is essentially independent on @xmath17  in the whole range @xmath66 . in summary , we have here explicitly shown that spinless @xmath1-wave  order parameters exists for all doping levels of the qshi . at low to",
    "moderate doping levels the spinless bond order parameter @xmath64 dominates , whereas for very high doping levels the spinless on - site @xmath50 eventually becomes larger .",
    "this helps explain why the majorana mode found in e.g.  vortex cores exists for all doping levels of the ti .",
    "while the @xmath1-wave  character of an induced @xmath0-wave  superconducting state at a ti surface is of wide interest due to majorana fermion creation , so are of course other systems with majorana fermions .",
    "recently linder _ et al . _",
    "@xcite discovered that majorana fermions also exists at the surface of a @xmath2-wave  superconducting 3d ti .",
    "the surface / interface of a @xmath2-wave  sc contains zero energy states , or midgap andreev bound states , since @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the angle of incidence ( see e.g.  ref .  ) .",
    "when these states exist on the surface of a ti , their double spin - degeneracy is broken and a majorana fermion appears instead .",
    "this is contrast to the topologically trivial high - t@xmath69 scs where spin - degeneracy is never broken but gives rise to `` double '' majorana fermions . from an experimental perspective",
    ", however , there are two crucially important questions that needs to be addressed before realizing this majorana system . ( 1 ) : in a self - consistent model of a qshi - @xmath2 sc interface , will the induced superconducting state in the qshi be of the required @xmath2-wave  character , and ( 2 ) : how protected is the majorana fermion , i.e.  how large is the excitation gap ? by rotating the sc in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] to a ( 1,1 ) interface and , instead of @xmath18 , using an effective pairing amplitude @xmath70 on nearest neighbor bonds , we can model an interface between a qshi and a @xmath2-wave  sc .",
    "we start the self - consistency loop with @xmath71 having a pure @xmath2-wave  symmetry , i.e. @xmath72 , but we do not impose any symmetry constraints on @xmath73 during the loop , as to not prevent the formation of other , competing pairing symmetries at the interface .",
    "this procedure results in a solution that is fully @xmath2-wave  in the bulk and persists out to the s1 site with only a moderately large inverse proximity effect .",
    "this @xmath2-wave  state also leaks weakly into the qshi insulator where it very rapidly decays .",
    "however , there is a larger , but imaginary , component of @xmath74 on the @xmath27-bond , accompanied by an imaginary and opposite signed @xmath75 . in aggregate",
    "this gives a local @xmath76-wave symmetry @xcite at the qshi edge .",
    "thus an effective model with a purely @xmath2-wave  superconducting order parameter at the qshi edge is not valid for a proximity induced @xmath2-wave  state .",
    "however , a small , but finite , @xmath2-wave  component still exists at the interface , so zero energy states might still exist at the interface .",
    "we thus turn to investigating the bogoliubov band structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwave ] .",
    "the dirac cone ( red ) close to @xmath77 ( exact position is set by @xmath17 ) lives on the left hand side of the qshi and is thus unaffected by the sc .",
    "the low - lying band at @xmath78 ( green ) lives on the unaffacted right hand side of the sc and thus gives the doubly degenerate zero energy states always present at the surface of @xmath2-wave  scs . for @xmath79 , the zero energy states on the left hand side of the sc creates a mirror - symmetric band at @xmath80 to the green band .",
    "however , for finite @xmath27  this band ( blue , crosses ) is found mainly at non - zero energies and it has only _ one single _ crossing of @xmath81 ( arrow ) . this is a single majorana fermion mode and",
    "its @xmath43-value is the same as the @xmath43-value for the ( now gapped ) dirac apex of the qshi edge state .",
    "however , this mode joins the nodal quasiparticle excitations arising from the bulk @xmath82-wave order parameter at @xmath53 .",
    "thus , this single majorana mode has _ no _ excitation gap to topologically trivial states .",
    "thus , the single majorana fermion at @xmath81 has _ no _ excitation gap to topologically trivial states .",
    "the band structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwave ] is qualitatively similar for all finite @xmath27  and moderately small to large @xmath17 .",
    "however , for @xmath83 the would - be majorana mode merges with the conical @xmath82-wave  nodal structure at @xmath84 and disappears , i.e.  there is then no state at zero energy that is localized at the qshi - sc interface .",
    "we also note that in order to achieve the band structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwave ] self - consistency is crucial . with a step - function order parameter @xmath85 ,",
    "the band for the zero energy states at the qshi - sc interface is essentially mirror symmetric to the equivalent band residing on the unaffected side of the sc , and thus no single majorana mode is created .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to our results for a @xmath0-wave  sc and is due to the intricate interplay between the qshi edge state and the zero energy states of the @xmath2-wave  sc . to summarize this section ,",
    "we have shown that a single majorana fermion exists only for doped qshi-@xmath2-wave  sc structures and that there is no excitation gap for this mode .",
    "thus , from an experimental point of view , we do not expect this majorana fermion to be stable for quantum computing operations @xcite ."
