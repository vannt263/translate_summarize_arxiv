    "our understanding of the ferromagnetic phase transition foresees the appearance of a finite , spatially uniform spontaneous ( i.e. occurring in zero applied magnetic field ) magnetization as the temperature is lowered below a well - defined critical ( curie ) temperature  @xcite . strictly speaking , however , a finite three - dimensional body",
    "( i.e. a body extending over sufficiently large but _ finite _ lengths in all three spatial directions ) lacks a finite uniform magnetization at any temperature  @xcite , as a result of the dipole - dipole interaction , which , albeit weak , frustrates the tendency to ferromagnetism inherent to the exchange interaction  @xcite .",
    "thus , the dipole - dipole interaction leads necessarily to a situation of `` avoided critical point ''",
    "@xcite , where the phase transition proceeds via a yet not fully elucidated and probably not universal mechanism  @xcite . at present , both the theoretical and experimental behavior of the various thermodynamic quantities in the vicinity of such an avoided critical point",
    "are uncertain . here",
    "we demonstrate , on one side , the validity of conventional notions like critical exponents and scaling hypothesis@xcite in the vicinity of such an avoided critical point , implying the existence of a correlation length governing the phase transition . on the other side",
    ", we also establish that , when the putative critical point is _ approached _ , the non - analytic behavior transforms into an analytic one .",
    "simultaneously , we observe that the paramagnetic - to - ferromagnetic phase transition proceeds within a background of spatially nonuniform magnetization .",
    "this observation implies that the typical period of modulation  established by the competition between exchange and dipole - dipole interaction and characterizing the phase with nonuniform magnetization ",
    "persists below as well as above the putative critical temperature , alongside the correlation length .",
    "the paramagnetic - to - ferromagnetic phase transition investigated in this work occurs in ultrathin fe films grown at room temperature by molecular - beam epitaxy onto the ( 001 ) surface of a cu single crystal ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "the system has macroscopic lengths within a plane but finite thickness perpendicular to the plane ( typically between 1.6 and 2.0 atomic monolayers ( ml ) ) .",
    "it is magnetized perpendicularly to the plane , so that it has the right symmetry to realize the famous onsager critical point  @xcite of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model .",
    "however , as shown in ref .  , it also suffers the very same frustration foreseen for finite three - dimensional bodies so that the paramagnetic - to - ferromagnetic phase transition is associated with the appearance of stripes and/or bubble domains of opposite magnetization rather than with the formation of a spatially uniform spontaneous magnetization  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the transition falls into the category of transitions with `` avoided critical point '' .",
    "+ we have followed three strategies : on one side an experimental one , consisting in performing magneto - optical kerr effect ( moke )  @xcite measurements of the macroscopic , spatially averaged magnetization as a function of temperature @xmath1 and external magnetic field @xmath2 applied perpendicularly to the film . technically speaking ,",
    "moke measures a signal which is _ proportional _ to the average magnetization  @xcite .",
    "here we use the character `` @xmath3 '' to identify the measured quantity , which is accordingly given in arbitrary units . in a second step ,",
    "the measurement of macroscopic thermodynamic quantities was complemented with spatially resolved magnetic imaging  performed with sempa@xcite  aimed at measuring the evolution of the _ local _ magnetization during the phase transition , with submicrometer spatial resolution .",
    "the complementary use of moke and sempa microscopy to define the phase diagram of the fe films investigated in this work is pictorially sketched in fig.1 .",
    "finally , we explored the possibility of realizing the scaling hypothesis in monte - carlo simulations of a 2d ising model , with spins on a lattice and interacting via the familiar exchange interaction  which promotes ferromagnetic order  and dipolar interaction .",
    "the latter , albeit weak , is long ranged and in films magnetized perpendicularly to the plane frustrates the tendency to ferromagnetism . in the presence of the dipolar interaction ,",

    "we have detected a substantial dynamical component and the results of these studies will be reported in a separate paper .",
    "a color code , indicated along the vertical bar , is used for the values of @xmath2 .",
    "we distinguish two extreme sets of @xmath11-curves . on the right - hand side those corresponding to larger values of @xmath2 , taken in a state of uniform magnetization .",
    "they show the familiar behavior of @xmath11-curves separating out with increasing magnetic field and are suggestive of a conventional underlying critical point becoming more and more `` avoided '' with increasing applied magnetic field ( this is an example of trivially `` avoided critical point ''  @xcite ) . on the left - hand side the family of curves corresponding to low @xmath2 : while the temperature is increased the average magnetization abruptly drops to almost zero as the system enters the state of static modulated order , observed directly with sempa ( not reported here ) .",
    "those images indicate that the magnetization within the domains is still large and therefore the vanishing of @xmath3 ( _ global _ magnetization ) below @xmath15 300 k for small applied fields is entirely due to the cancellation of finite opposite values of the local magnetization within the domains .",
    "we point out , however , that our distinction between `` high '' and `` low '' magnetic field curves is based on our imaging of the spatial distribution of the magnetization : the macroscopic thermodynamic quantity @xmath10 itself does not contain , at first glance , any specific information which could be used to classify the set of @xmath11-curves . + the scaling hypothesis  @xcite states that the equation of state @xmath16 can be simplified to a one variable relation @xmath17 , provided the rescaled variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 are used , @xmath20 being the so called reduced temperature . in conventional ferromagnets",
    "@xmath21 is the critical temperature at which , e.g. , the _ critical isochamp _ ( order parameter ) @xmath22 vanishes .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath23 is defined via the asymptotic behavior of the critical isochamp near @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath24 . in our system",

    "streactly speaking  does not exist either .",

    "therefore , `` collapsed '' and `` non - collapsed '' points can be reported in the proper location of the @xmath4 plane to define the phase diagram . in the scaling plot of fig.2 ( bottom ) ,",

    "notice that many reddish color - coded points appear in the lower left - hand section of the scaling plot fig.2 ( bottom ) .",
    "they correspond to high temperatures and low applied magnetic fields and they are scattered because of noise , resulting in a small density . despite this , we consider them as `` collapsed '' , because they are spread along the continuation of the scaling function of the 2d ising model ( the dashed line in fig.2 ( bottom ) ) .",
    "the bell - shaped region starts on the left with the boundary line marking the transition from ( static ) modulated - to - uniform phase , recorded by direct sempa imaging of the spatial distribution of the magnetization .",

    "<S> we indeed observe power laws and scaling behavior over extraordinarily many decades of the suitable scaling variables at the paramagnetic - to - ferromagnetic phase transition in ultrathin fe films . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that , when the putative critical point is approached , the singular behavior of thermodynamic quantities transforms into an analytic one : the critical point does not exist , it is replaced by a more complex phase involving domains of opposite magnetization , below as well as @xmath0 the putative critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> all essential experimental results are reproduced by monte - carlo simulations in which , alongside the familiar exchange coupling , the competing dipole - dipole interaction is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that a scaling behavior of macroscopic thermodynamic quantities is not necessarily a signature for an underlying second - order phase transition and that the paramagnetic - to - ferromagnetic phase transition proceeds , very likely , in the presence of at least two long spatial scales : the correlation length and the size of magnetic domains . </S>"
