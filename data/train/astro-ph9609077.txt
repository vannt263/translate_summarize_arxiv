    "damped lyman - alpha absorber ( dla ) systems , detected along lines of sight to unrelated high - redshift quasars , have been proposed as possible progenitors of normal disk galaxies today .",
    "they appear to contain a substantial fraction of the baryons known to exist in normal galaxies today ( lanzetta , wolfe , & turnshek 1995 ) .",
    "several searches for the galaxies responsible for various dla systems have resulted in a few detections of emission  line galaxies ( lowenthal  1991 ; macchetto  1993 ; mller & warren 1993 ; francis  1996 ) , but all appear either to be agn or are at a similar redshift as the qso , suggesting that the source of their ionization may not be a result of star formation .",
    "we report on the detection of an object , designated dla 2233 + 131 , responsible for a previously known dla system at @xmath7 ( lu  1993 ) in the spectrum of qso  2233 + 131 ( @xmath8 ; crampton , schade , & cowley 1985 ) .",
    "it was found serendipitously during observations of a candidate for a different dla system in the same field .",
    "the object was also selected independently as a dla candidate on the basis of its broad - band colors by steidel , pettini , & hamilton ( 1995 ) , which was unknown to us at the time .",
    "we obtained direct images of the field in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands , and long - slit spectra using low and moderate resolution gratings .",
    "details can be found in djorgovski  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the discovery spectrum of the dla is shown in figure 1 ; the qso spectrum is plotted for comparison .",
    "we find the dla in emission at a location offset @xmath2 ( @xmath11  kpc for @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) from the qso line  of  sight .",
    "there are no signs of any higher  ionization emission lines from the dla , suggesting that this object does not harbor an agn .",
    "the star formation rate implied by the ly@xmath0 line is @xmath14 , and that by the restframe far  uv continuum is @xmath15 , suggesting that there is very little dust present in this galaxy .",
    "the ly@xmath0 luminosity for this galaxy is the highest for non  agn at these redshifts in the list of steidel  ( 1996 ) .",
    "this galaxy s luminosity is similar to that of a @xmath16 galaxy today .",
    "the emission line appears offset by @xmath6  km  s@xmath5 from the damped absorption line , which could be explained by a rotating disk galaxy .",
    "dla systems represent a significant population of high  redshift objects which have been proposed as the progenitors of normal disk galaxies ( wolfe 1993 ) .",
    "our observations for dla  2233 + 131 are fully  consistent with that hypothesis .",
    "hst images are planned for this source ( c. steidel , private communication ) , which may be capable of determining if the source shows a disk  like morphology or one more similar to that of the steidel population ( e.g. in giavalisco  1996 ) .",
    "the search for primeval galaxies  a population of the progenitors of present  day spheroidal galaxies  is a central goal of modern observational cosmology .",
    "recent optical searches for the signs of ly@xmath0 emission from such a population ( e.g. thompson , djorgovski , & trauger 1995 ) have been largely unsuccessful .",
    "those optical searches for ly@xmath0 could be brought into agreement with the present - day space density of spheroidal systems if the primeval galaxies were , in general , enshrouded in a modest quantity of dust .",
    "similar searches for longer ",
    "wavelength emission lines should be much less - affected by dust obscuration .",
    "for this reason , we are pursuing a search for the o  ii , h@xmath17 , [ o  iii ] , and h@xmath0 lines at redshifts of @xmath18 using the near - infrared camera on the w. m. keck telescope .",
    "we have deliberately chosen fields centered on high redshift qsos , dlas , or radio galaxies , and narrow - band filters to match an emission line at that known object s redshift .",
    "results for the first four fields were presented by pahre & djorgovski ( 1995 ) ; to date we have surveyed nearly three times the area described in that work , and are reaching flux limits up to twice as deep .",
    "the estimated limits imposed by our survey are shown in figure 2 .",
    "comparison is made to several other near - infrared searches : thompson , djorgovski , & beckwith ( 1994 , tdb ) ; parkes , collins , & joseph ( 1994 , pcj ) ; and mannucci , beckwith , & mccaughrean ( 1994 , mbm ) .",
    "( see pahre & djorgovski 1995 for further details on the comparison . ) in our search we have found a few promising candidates with narrow  band excess emission of @xmath19 , and are currently following these up with optical spectroscopy .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , we are beginning to probe the relevant region of parameter space where we would expect to find a population of primeval spheroidal galaxies if they were to form during a relatively short burst ( @xmath20  gyr ) of star formation while obscured by a small quantity of dust .",
    "we note that the population of star  forming galaxies discovered by steidel  ( 1996 ) should be undetected in our survey because of their low star formation rates and surface density . on the other hand , if there exists a population of highly  reddened , star  forming galaxies at these redshifts they would be missed by the blue selection criteria of steidel  but should in principle be found by our search for the longer ",
    "wavelength nebular lines .",
    "furthermore , the importance of resonant scattering of the ly@xmath0 found by steidel  should not affect the nebular lines used in our near - infrared search .",
    "we would like to thank l. lu , m. rauch , c. steidel , and d. thompson for many useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf pyi award ast-9157412 and the bressler foundation .",
