    "a long standing and yet unsolved problem is to explain color confinement in qcd .",
    "an important first step in this direction would be to prove the confinement of static quarks .",
    "indeed , this has been convincingly demonstrated by many lattice studies @xcite .",
    "however , it would be desirable to study this phenomenon with less reliance on numerics , since monte carlo simulations do not have the logical transparency of mathematical derivations .",
    "the relevant observables are products of wilson - loop operators @xcite .",
    "when one has periodicity in euclidean time ( ie .",
    "finite temperature ) then one may use a polyakov loop @xcite operator , ie .",
    "the polyakov loop is a closed , periodic time - like wilson loop .",
    "since the lagrangian includes massless fields and one is interested in the infrared behaviour of the theory , it is sensible to implement some kind of infrared cutoff .",
    "it is well - known for example that in supersymmetric theories with massless modes , the non - renormalisation `` theorems '' fail in the absence of an infrared regulator @xcite .",
    "one possibility is to use a wilsonian effective action @xcite which by definition includes a momentum space infrared cut - off on the quantum fluctuations .",
    "an alternative procedure is to simply work on some compact euclidean space . of these",
    ", the four torus , @xmath1 , is the most attractive .",
    "when dealing with @xmath1 , one automatically includes the finite temperature case ( @xmath2 ) , and unphysical curvature effects are absent . on @xmath1 one also maintains translational invariance , and thus any relevant supersymmetry .",
    "we assume that our gauge fields are periodic in time a_(x^0+,)=a_(x_0 , ) . in the quantum theory",
    ", we may interpret @xmath3 as the inverse temperature , see for example @xcite . the polyakov loop operator @xmath4 is defined as the following trace of a path ordered exponential of @xmath0    and @xmath5 is the representation of the gauge group which acts on the fermions .",
    "the polyakov loop is invariant under gauge transformations which are periodic in time , @xmath6 being the time transition function ( see section 2 ) .",
    "however , since we always work with time periodic objects , ie .",

    "the two - point function    yields the free energy @xmath8 in the presence of a heavy quark at @xmath9 and a heavy antiquark at @xmath10 . in",
    "the confining low - temperature phase @xmath8 increases for large separations ] of the quark - antiquark pair and thus @xmath11 . in the deconfining high - temperature phase the free energy reaches a constant value for large separations and @xmath12 .",
    "inferring the cluster property we see that @xmath13 vanishes in the confining phase but not in the deconfining one . in other words , it is an order parameter for confinement .",
    "note that the weyl gauge , @xmath14 , is not compatible with time - periodicity .",
    "yet we still would like @xmath0 to be as simple as possible , since we are interested in observables only depending on @xmath0 .",
    "on the two dimensional torus , @xmath15 , one can perform an abelian projection @xcite with respect to the polyakov loop operators and gauge fix in such a way that @xmath0 is in the cartan subalgebra and is independent of time , while preserving the time periodicity of @xmath16 . in this gauge one",
    "has a remarkable cancellation between part of @xmath17 and the fadeev - popov determinant .",
    "this simplifies the calculation of the partition function and the expectation value of the polyakov loop order parameter , and avoids zero mode ambiguities @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of to what extent the gauge fixing used in @xcite can be generalised to qcd on the four torus .",
    "the gauge fixing procedure hinges on the diagonalisation of the path ordered exponential , @xmath18 , whose trace is the polyakov loop .",
    "it is convenient that @xmath18 be periodic in the spatial variables . yet unless we are in the perturbative sector , the gauge fields themselves are necessarily non - periodic .",
    "this non periodicity is characterised by a set of group - valued transition functions .",
    "we introduce a set of _ non - abelian _ transition functions which facilitate a periodic @xmath18 even in the non - perturbative sectors .",
    "unlike the well known abelian transition functions introduced by t hooft @xcite , our transition functions encompass all instanton sectors , thus solving the problem of finding smooth transition functions for the odd instanton sectors of @xmath19 gauge theory .",
    "in contrast to the two dimensional case the diagonalisation procedure has unavoidable singularities . the singularities can be interpreted as dirac strings @xcite joining magnetically charged `` defects '' .",
    "here we understand defects as points , loops ( not to be confused with the dirac strings ! ) , sheets and lumps where @xmath18 has degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "the locations of the defects are gauge invariant and may be viewed as additional `` collective coordinates '' associated to the gauge fixing .",
    "the simplest case ( and probably the most relevant for the qcd path integral ) is where one only has point defects ( which can be viewed as magnetic monopoles ) . here the final gauge fixed potential has very simple periodicity properties , and the topological charge is completely fixed by the network of monopoles and dirac strings ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we also consider the more general case where one has extended defects .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section two",
    "we recall some basic facts about gauge fields on the torus , including the standard abelian transition functions .",
    "our new set of non - abelian transition functions ( which includes the odd sector of @xmath19 ) is presented in section 3 .",
    "we also explain how one can use the polyakov loop itself to define a different set of non - abelian transition functions .",
    "next , in section 4 we elaborate our gauge fixing procedure , and study the special case where one has no defects . in section 5",
    "we discuss the problem of defects , and show how they contribute to the instanton number .",
    "conventions and some technical results are collected in three appendices .",
    "we view the four torus as @xmath20 modulo the lattice generated by four orthogonal vectors @xmath21 .",
    "the euclidean lengths of the @xmath22 are denoted by @xmath23 ( we may identify @xmath24 with the inverse temperature @xmath3 ) .",
    "local gauge invariants such as @xmath25 are periodic with respect to a shift by an arbitrary lattice vector .",
    "however , it follows that gauge fields have to be periodic only up to gauge transformations . in order to specify boundary conditions for gauge potentials @xmath26 on",
    "the torus one introduces a set of _ transition functions _",
    "@xmath27 , which are defined on the whole of @xmath20 .",
    "the periodicity properties of @xmath26 are as follows a_(x+b _ ) = u_^-1(x)a_(x)u_(x)+i u_^-1(x)_u_(x ) , = 0,1,2,3where the summation convention is _ not _ applied .",
    "the transition functions @xmath27 have to satisfy the cocycle condition where the _ twists @xmath28 lie in the centre of the group . in this paper",

    "if we are to describe the non - perturbative sectors , one must consider non - trivial transition functions .",
    "for a given @xmath33 we only require _ one _ set of transition functions",
    ". if we have two sets of transition functions with the same instanton number then they are gauge equivalent @xcite .    for @xmath34 , @xmath35",
    ", one can write down a set of very simple _ abelian _ transition functions , which include all possible values of @xmath33 . for @xmath19 ,",
    "the situation is rather peculiar , in that there exist abelian transition functions for the even instanton number case , but for odd @xmath33 , the transition functions are _ necessarily _ non - abelian .",
    "consider the following set of transition functions    where @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being the discrete lattice in the cartan subalgebra @xmath38 ;    and we have introduced the dimensionless coordinates [ dim]_=x_/l_,=0,1,2,3.these transition functions satisfy the cocycle condition ( [ cocycle ] ) , and using ( [ q ] ) , the instanton number associated with these transition functions is simply    now , if we take @xmath39 to be proportional to @xmath40 it is easy to see that @xmath33 is always even . to get an odd charge one must take non - parallel @xmath41 s . for example",
    ", in @xmath42 consider @xmath43 in this case @xmath44 .",
    "however , for @xmath19 @xmath40 and @xmath39 must be parallel since the cartan subalgebra is one dimensional .",
    "hence , within this class of transition functions one is restricted to even topological charges .",
    "although the transition functions ( [ trans ] ) are not the most general abelian transition functions , it is easy to see that _ any _ abelian transition functions lead to an even @xmath33 for @xmath19 .",
    "although we have concentrated on the transition function question , another ( to date unsolved ) problem is to obtain the instantons for pure gauge theory on @xmath1 .",
    "while t hooft found some extremely simple `` abelian '' instantons @xcite , these can only represent single points in the moduli space of a given instanton sector .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the situation on @xmath45 where atiyah _ et al _ @xcite gave an algebraic recipe for computing all instantons .",
    "in fact one of the few things known about instantons on @xmath1 is a negative result . using the nahm transformation @xcite ,",
    "van baal @xcite has argued that there are no @xmath34 instantons with @xmath44 for @xmath46 .",
    "we should stress that while there are _ no charge one instantons _",
    "there do exist _ configurations _ with @xmath44 .",
    "while for @xmath44 , the minimal action is never achieved one can find configurations whose action is arbitrarily close to the instanton number .",
    "numerical @xcite and analytical studies indicate that as one brings the action closer to the minimum the action density becomes concentrated near a point . for the higher charge",
    "@xmath47 sectors , smooth instantons are known to exist @xcite .",
    "however , for the purposes of our gauge fixing the explicit form of the instantons is not required .",
    "we have seen that abelian transition functions are not sufficient to describe the odd charge sectors , for the gauge group @xmath19 . yet",
    "we would still like to have our transition functions as simple as possible .",
    "consider the following possibility ; let us take three of the four transition functions to be the identity , ie .    within this ansatz , the cocycle condition ( [ cocycle ] ) implies that @xmath48 is periodic in @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . now the formula ( [ q ] ) for the instanton number reduces to    with @xmath52 .",
    "note that the two dimensional integrals in ( [ q ] ) drop out , and one only has a single three dimensional integral .",
    "furthermore , it is evident that the @xmath53 dependence of @xmath54 is irrelevant , and we may assume that @xmath54 is independent of @xmath53 .",
    "in other words , suppose we have a @xmath48 which depends on @xmath53 , then a simpler @xmath54 with the same instanton number can be obtained simply by setting @xmath53 to be an arbitrary constant .",
    "a very useful consequence of ( [ 3dintegral ] ) is that if @xmath48 can be decomposed into _ periodic _ factors , then the topological charge is simply a sum of the contributions of the periodic factors , more precisely , if we can write @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are periodic in all directions , then @xmath58 much like the situation on @xmath45 .",
    "first we show that ( [ idea ] ) is easily achieved in the even sectors of @xmath19 .",
    "let us start with _",
    "_ transition functions    which lead to @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( we use the dimensionless coordinates @xmath61 defined by ( [ dim ] ) ) . here",
    "only two transition functions are the identity .",
    "however it is straightforward to gauge transform @xmath62 to unity . to achieve this",
    "we require a gauge transformation @xmath30 which is periodic in @xmath49 and @xmath51 ( since we wish to keep @xmath63 and @xmath64 as unity ) , and has the property that @xmath65 choosing the parameterisation    @xmath66 and @xmath67 are periodic in @xmath49 and @xmath51 , and satisfy @xmath68 one can simply take ( our conventions regarding theta functions are explained in appendix a )    where @xmath69 is not an integer . since the two theta functions are regular and have no common zeroes , the functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 are smooth .",
    "note that @xmath30 only depends on @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "after this gauge transformation ( [ idea ] ) holds and @xmath48 becomes non - abelian @xmath70 multiplying @xmath48 by the periodic abelian factor @xmath71 does not change the instanton number .",
    "hence , an equally valid set of transition functions for the @xmath72 sector is @xmath73 note that @xmath54 is independent of @xmath53 and periodic in @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "now consider the following set of transition functions u_0=u_1=u_2=,u_3=v^-1(x)e^i n _ 0 _ 3 v(x)e^-i n _ 0_3,nz .",
    "@xmath48 is still periodic in @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 and thus these transition functions satisfy the cocycle condition ( [ cocycle ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the instanton number of these transition functions is precisely half that of ( [ 2n ] ) ; i.e. now we have @xmath74 , @xmath60 .",
    "thus we have a set of @xmath75 transition functions for all instanton sectors .",
    "let us write our @xmath54 more explicitly @xmath76 note that    this will greatly simplify the analysis of the gauge fixing in the next section .",
    "suppose we have a set of transition functions with the following properties    the non - abelian transition functions introduced here clearly satisfy these conditions .",
    "then consider the following gauge transformation @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the path ordered exponential in ( [ defpol ] ) which in general is non - periodic in time . now @xmath78 has the following periodicity properties    for brevity we use the notation ( ) : = ( l_0,).using ( [ newu],[condition],[polloopperiod ] ) , the gauge transformed transition functions are @xmath79",
    "thus we have performed a gauge transformation from transition functions where @xmath80 to transition functions with @xmath81 .",
    "note however that the new @xmath63 is simply the path ordered exponential of the original @xmath0 whose trace is the polyakov loop . applying the formula ( [ q ] ) for the instanton number to the new set of transition functions yields    where @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "it is evident that for @xmath19 the right hand side is the winding number of the map @xmath84 , ie .",
    "the instanton number is just the winding number of the polyakov loop .",
    "the analogous result for gauge theories on @xmath20 has been given in ref .",
    "we emphasise that ( [ polloopindex ] ) is only valid when the ( original ) transition functions satisfy ( [ condition ] ) .",
    "we may always assume that we start with a smooth gauge potential which is periodic in time , so that @xmath7 .",
    "we may also assume that we are in a gauge where the spatial transition functions have the property ( [ condition ] ) .",
    "thus we may use the formula ( [ polloopindex ] ) for the instanton number . another useful consequence of ( [ condition ] ) is that this together with ( [ polloopperiod ] ) implies that @xmath85 is _ periodic in all spatial directions .",
    "_ note that the standard abelian transition functions can only have property ( [ condition ] ) if we are in the perturbative ( @xmath86 ) sector .",
    "the non - abelian transition functions given in the last section do indeed satisfy ( [ condition ] ) .",
    "following @xcite we seek a ( time - periodic ) gauge transformation , @xmath30 , for which the gauge transformed @xmath0 is independent of time and in the cartan subalgebra .",
    "below we argue that it is impossible in general to find a smooth gauge transformation which leads to a gauge field with the desired properties . while it is straightforward to _ formally _ define a suitable gauge transformation , the gauge transformed potential is ill defined in the presence of `` defects '' where @xmath87 has degenerate eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to define the _ defect manifold _    which is invariant under time - periodic gauge transformations .",
    "a _ defect _ is understood to be a connected subset of @xmath88 .",
    "before we consider the various defects , we first show that in the absence of defects a suitable non - singular gauge transform exists .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath89 , there is a smooth ( periodic in time but non - periodic in the spatial variables ) gauge transformation which transforms our starting gauge field , so that @xmath0 has the simple form    with @xmath90 in the cartan subalgebra and periodic ,    consider the time - periodic gauge transformation @xcite gauge - trf-1 where @xmath91 is the path ordered exponential ( [ defpol ] ) , and @xmath92 diagonalises @xmath93 , i.e.    with @xmath94 in the cartan subalgebra @xmath38 . the fractional power of @xmath95 in ( [ gauge - trf-1 ] ) is defined via this diagonalisation of @xmath95 .",
    "then it follows at once that the gauge transformed @xmath0 reads    for @xmath89 the eigenvalues of @xmath95 are nowhere degenerate and we can find smooth @xmath96 . since @xmath93 is periodic in all spatial directions it has the same spectrum at @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in the absence of defects",
    "the spectral flow from @xmath97 to @xmath98 can not interchange two eigenvalues , that is the situation depicted in fig.[spectorus]b can not occur , and @xmath99 must be periodic .",
    "in general , the periodicity of @xmath99 implies only that the eigenvalues of @xmath41 are periodic modulo @xmath100 .",
    "but if they are not periodic they would have to wind as shown in fig.[spectorus]a when we move from @xmath97 to @xmath98",
    ". then at least one eigenvalue of @xmath41 is degenerate somewhere on @xmath101 and @xmath102 is not empty .",
    "thus @xmath103 must be periodic ,    > from ( [ a0 ] ) it is clear that the transformed @xmath0 indeed has the stated properties .",
    "= 5 cm    if @xmath95 has no degenerate eigenvalue , then @xmath104 in ( [ diagonalization ] ) and hence the gauge transformation @xmath105 in ( [ gauge - trf-1 ] ) is determined up to right - multiplication by a diagonal matrix .",
    "the role of the residual local gauge group @xmath106 , and in particular the transformation properties of the various matter and gauge fields under this residual symmetry , has been discussed lucidly in @xcite .",
    "hence , although @xmath93 and @xmath107 are periodic , we may not assume that @xmath92 is periodic .",
    "all we can say is that    where the @xmath108 lie in the residual gauge group @xmath109 , i.e. they are abelian and satisfy the cocycle condition [ cocycle - ii ] r_i()r_j(+b_i)=r_j()r_i(+b_j).using ( [ newu],[polloopperiod ] ) and ( [ condition ] ) , the final form of the transition functions is @xmath110 and    which are abelian .",
    "inserting these transition functions into ( [ q ] ) yields @xmath86 .",
    "this already shows , that for gauge fields with non - zero instanton number there are necessarily defects on @xmath101 .",
    "in the @xmath19 case we may write @xmath111 where the @xmath112 are functions of the spatial coordinates . the cocycle condition ( [ cocycle - ii ] ) implies that    unless all the @xmath113 are zero one can not find a smooth diagonalising @xmath92 such that the abelian transition functions @xmath108 become the identity .",
    "we have seen , that @xmath92 , which diagonalises @xmath93 is defined only up to right - multiplication ,    if we append to each point in @xmath101 the set of all diagonalising matrices @xmath92 , we get a @xmath114-principal bundle over @xmath101 , here denoted by @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "a smooth and _ periodic _ @xmath92 on @xmath101 would be a global section in this bundle .",
    "but in general the @xmath114-bundles over @xmath101 are non - trivial and are characterised by three integers . indeed , with a ( time - independent )",
    "abelian gauge transformation ( [ resgauge ] ) we can bring the transition functions @xmath116 into the standard form    where the @xmath117 are the integers defined in ( [ integers ] ) . if not all @xmath117 vanish , then these are transition functions of nontrivial @xmath114-bundles over @xmath101 .    a more direct and physical way to understand the obstruction uses the ( magnetic ) @xmath114-gauge potential @xcite    on @xmath101 , which transforms under the residual gauge transformation ( [ resgauge ] ) as @xmath118 using ( [ cocycle - ii ] ) it follows at once that the @xmath119 magnetic fluxes @xmath120 are quantised .",
    "we conclude that the integers @xmath117 in ( [ integers],[simpletrans ] ) can not be changed by a smooth ( abelian ) gauge transformation .",
    "note , that the flux @xmath121 is independent of @xmath122 and @xmath123 may be interpreted as a sourceless magnetic potential permeating the torus .",
    "the fixing of the residual gauge freedom can be accomplished much like in the two - dimensional case @xcite and is discussed in appendix c.",
    "below we shall argue that isolated defects may be identified with magnetic monopoles , line defects with magnetic loops and sheetlike defects with domain walls .",
    "monopoles may be present if @xmath124 contains non - contractable 2-spheres and magnetic loops if @xmath125 has non - contractable loops ( besides the 3 topologically distinct loops winding around @xmath101 ) . in other words , monopoles and loops can only be present",
    "if    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     besides monopoles and loops , there may exist defect walls extending over the whole three torus .",
    "the three types of defects are depicted in fig.[defects ] .",

    "along such a path the eigenvalues of @xmath41 can neither wind nor exchange as in the absence of defects .",
    "hence , spectral flows as shown in fig.[spectorus ] are not possible and @xmath103 must be periodic , and as in chapter 4 we have @xmath128 .",
    "since such transition functions have instanton number zero , we have a contradiction in all @xmath129 sectors .",
    "we now specialise to the gauge group @xmath19 ; we will consider @xmath34 elsewhere .",

    "the magnetic charge of the @xmath137 defects is minus that of the @xmath136 defects so that the _ total magnetic charge is zero .",
    "this differs from the @xmath20 case , where one only has magnetic charge neutrality if one includes `` charges at infinity '' . in order to establish these results",
    "it is convenient to introduce a static `` higgs '' field @xmath138 via ( ) = e^i ( ) , = _ j _ j . [ higgs0 ] of course @xmath139 is not globally defined .",

    "n_alt(s_i ) .",
    "hence the instanton number is the sum over the winding numbers of the higgs field @xmath170 at @xmath171 defects .",
    "taking into account equation ( [ relation - phi - alt ] ) we obtain ( _ alt _",
    "alt_alt ) = - 8 i f_mag .",
    "thus a @xmath171 defect with winding number @xmath172 has magnetic charge @xmath173 .",
    "similar considerations yield that the instanton number @xmath33 is given by the sum over winding numbers of the higgs field @xmath174 at @xmath175 defects , or equivalently , by the sum of all monopole charges at @xmath175 defects .",
    "the relation between the instanton number and the magnetic charges of _ pointlike monopoles _ on @xmath20 has already been obtained by reinhardt @xcite . _    for a non - zero flux the magnetic potential @xmath123 must necessarily be singular somewhere on @xmath147 , else the flux @xmath176 would vanish . as is well - known from the dirac monopole",
    ", we may assume that @xmath123 is regular on @xmath147 with one point removed .",
    "since this holds true for any @xmath177 surrounding a charged defect we must attach a string to each such defect on which @xmath123 is singular . by definition , wherever the magnetic potential is singular the diagonalisation matrix @xmath92 is singular .",
    "let us now consider a @xmath178 surrounding a monopole - antimonopole pair .",
    "on such a sphere the higgs field has no winding and can smoothly be diagonalised .",
    "this means that the strings on which @xmath92 ( and @xmath123 ) is singular start and end at defects with opposite magnetic charge . outside of these strings it is possible to choose @xmath104 smooth .",
    "a possible distribution of monopoles connected by strings is shown in fig.[monostrings ] .",
    "the string positions are gauge dependent . but",
    "they must start and end at ( anti)monopoles whose positions are gauge invariant .",
    "= 8 cm    there is some freedom regarding which defects are connected to each other with dirac strings .",
    "suppose we have a dirac string emanating from a @xmath156 defect .",
    "then this string may be connected to _ either _ a @xmath156 or @xmath159 defect with the opposite charge .",
    "we have shown that the instanton number , @xmath33 , is proportional to the total magnetic charge at @xmath136 defects .",
    "we can restate this result in terms of the dirac strings as follows ; @xmath33 is proportional to the number of dirac strings joining @xmath156 and @xmath159 defects anti - monopoles to @xmath159 monopoles count with a relative minus sign to strings joining @xmath156 monopoles and @xmath159 anti - monopoles . ] .",
    "in fact , it is possible to rewrite the instanton number formula ( [ polloopindex ] ) so that the contribution of the strings is transparent without introducing higgs fields .",
    "this calculation is given in appendix b.    to gain further insight we investigate @xmath95 in the vicinity of a point defect ( see also @xcite ) . for that we follow the eigenvalues along a closed path from @xmath179 to @xmath179 ( see fig.[defects]a ) passing through a monopole - monopole with @xmath156 ] .",
    "we may slightly deform this path so that it misses the monopole . on the deformed path",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath95 are nowhere degenerate and thus @xmath41 in ( [ diagonalization ] ) must be periodic ( see above ) . returning to the undeformed path through the monopole we conclude , that at the monopole , where both eigenvalues are @xmath100 , the two eigenvalues are reflected at @xmath181 as shown in fig.[defects]a .",
    "the spectral flow is continuous but not differentiable .",
    "since @xmath93 is smooth , the diagonalising @xmath92 in ( [ diagonalization ] ) must be singular to compensate for the non - smoothness of @xmath99 .",
    "as in the case without defects , @xmath92 is not necessarily periodic and obeys ( [ hilfs1 ] ) .    to summarise , in the presence of monopole and loop defects we can still perform the gauge transformation ( [ gauge - trf-1 ] ) .",
    "but it is necessarily singular on strings connecting the defects .",
    "the gauge transformed @xmath182 is periodic , but singular on these strings .",
    "after gauge fixing the transition functions can be chosen as in ( [ simpletrans ] ) .",
    "the instanton number is related to the magnetic charges of the defects in a very simple way .    in cases where domain walls extend over the whole torus",
    "the situation is analogous to the one in @xmath141-dimensional gauge theories .",
    "we can not avoid defects when going from one `` face '' of the torus to the opposite one .",
    "there is no obstruction for the eigenvalues to vary smoothly along a path crossing the wall .",
    "neither @xmath41 nor @xmath104 are singular at the wall ( see fig.[defects ] ) .",
    "but the eigenvalues of @xmath41 may wind or interchange if we move from @xmath97 to @xmath98 and thus @xmath99 may be periodic only up to a permutation of its entries , i.e. @xmath183 where the @xmath184 are weyl - reflections and the @xmath185 , with @xmath37 being the discrete lattice defined in ( [ discrete ] ) .",
    "now we can only prove , that the gauge transformed transition functions have the form @xmath186 where again the @xmath116 are in the abelian subgroup and fulfil the cocycle condition ( [ cocycle ] ) .",
    "this time dependence in the transition functions is reminiscent of the @xmath15 analysis @xcite . the gauge fixed @xmath0 has the form    as in the case without defects there are residual gauge transformations ( see appendix c ) .",
    "in this paper we have considered the gauge - fixing of yang - mills theory on the four torus for arbitrary instanton sectors .",
    "of course the choice of gauge fixing does not affect physics , but an appropriate gauge - fixing may considerably simplify the mathematical problem of computing or approximating functional integrals . motivated by their success in two dimensions we adopted an extended abelian projection on the four torus . here",
    "we require @xmath0 to be abelian , time independent and the spatial components @xmath187 of the gauge potential to be periodic in time .",
    "one difference with the @xmath15 problem is that we have the added complication of instanton sectors . in two dimensions",
    "one may assume that before gauge fixing the gauge potential @xmath188 is completely periodic , ie .",
    "the transition functions are trivial @xmath189 . in four dimensions",
    ", we may only assume this if we are in the zero instanton sector ( ie .",
    "the topological charge @xmath33 is zero ) .",
    "we have argued that for @xmath129 it is convenient to work with a new set of non - abelian transition functions . with these transition functions",
    "the path ordered exponential , @xmath190 , which is central to the gauge fixing is completely periodic , even though of course the gauge field itself is non - periodic . moreover , these transition functions include the odd instanton sectors of @xmath19 . to our knowledge ,",
    "smooth untwisted transition functions for this case have not been given before .",
    "the most significant break with the two dimensional treatment is the presence of unavoidable singularities in the final gauge fixed potential @xcite .",
    "these singularities are due to ambiguities in the diagonalisation of @xmath190 where the eigenvalues of @xmath190 are degenerate ( for @xmath19 this degeneracy occurs where @xmath191 ) .",
    "there is a close analogy between these defects ( ie .",
    "points , loops or surfaces where @xmath190 is degenerate ) and magnetic charges in yang - mills - higgs theories @xcite .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the special case where one only has point and loop defects , which can be interpreted as magnetic monopoles and magnetised loops .",
    "the gauge fixed potential is smooth everywhere except for `` dirac strings '' joining monopole ( loop ) pairs .",
    "the instanton number , @xmath33 is simply the number of magnetic charges at the @xmath156 defects .",
    "> from one viewpoint the existence of these magnetic defects imply that our attempt to generalise the two dimensional fixing has failed .",
    "we take the opposite view .",
    "it is a long standing conjecture that confinement of color is produced by dual superconductivity ( of type ii ) of the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "indeed , lattice calculations @xcite indicate that magnetic monopoles ( or loops ? ) are the dominant infrared degrees of freedom , at least in the maximal abelian gauge and the polyakov gauge .",
    "there is a long way from the picture of condensed magnetic monopoles to real @xmath192 . at present",
    "there is no analytic proof of the existence of the condensate of monopoles .",
    "however , in those theories where we understand confinement , the latter is due to the condensation of monopoles ; these examples are compact @xmath193 @xcite and supersymmetric yang - mills theories @xcite .",
    "the balancing of the energy and the entropy of monopoles ( and/or loops ) may explain the occurrence of the deconfinement transition in @xmath192 . at low temperatures",
    "we expect a condensation of monopoles with @xmath156 and of monopoles with @xmath159 . in the broken high temperature phase , where @xmath194",
    ", we do not expect long monopole loops but rather a dipole gas of monopole - antimonopole pairs , both with @xmath156 ( or both with @xmath159 ) .",
    "of course the treatment given here has been purely classical",
    ". the next step would be to study the path integral within this gauge fixing . at this point",
    "one would need a suitable approximation @xcite .",
    "with a view to investigating the confinement of static quarks it would be interesting to consider whether in any regime the monopoles and dirac strings play a dominant role in the path integral .",
    "we are grateful to o. jahn , f. lenz , g. rudolph and p. van baal for helpful discussions .",
    "our conventions with respect to theta functions are the same as ref .",
    "we work with the jacobi theta function with characteristics a + b ( z , i)= _ nz e^-(n+a)^2 + 2i(n+a)(z+b ) .",
    "this function has the following periodicity properties a + m + b+n ( z , i)= e^2i n a a + b ( z , i),m , nzand has zeros where @xmath195 .",
    "in this appendix we derive some of the technical results quoted in chapter 5 .      to relate this winding number to the magnetic flux we parameterise the normalised higgs field as    where the angles @xmath196 are functions on @xmath147 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath197 is diagonalised by @xcite @xmath198 the magnetic potential ( [ magnpot ] ) is @xmath199 , and the corresponding field strength is @xmath200 on the other hand , taking the higgs field ( [ higgs ] ) we get ( ) = 4 i = 8 i f_mag . comparing with equations ( [ magnwind3 ] ) and ( [ magnwind1 ] ) one readily obtains",
    "now we will relate @xmath201 to the higgs field @xmath202 . with the notation @xmath203 and @xmath204 we have @xmath205 and it follows that [ p3 ] ( p^-1 ) ^3 & = & - ^4| | - i ^3| || | + & & - 3 i ^2| | | | . under the trace",
    "the first two terms on the right hand side of ( [ p3 ] ) drop out .",
    "hence we have @xmath206      we showed in the paper that in the presence of magnetic monopoles the diagonalization is not smoothly possible .",
    "the matrix @xmath207 becomes singular on dirac strings connecting monopoles with opposite magnetic charges .",
    "we shall argue that the strings on which @xmath104 is singular contribute to the instanton number @xmath33 .",
    "setting @xmath208 one first observes for arbitrary gauge groups that @xmath209 where the @xmath141-form @xmath210 is @xmath211 thus we can convert the integral in ( [ polloopindex ] ) into a surface integral over the `` boundary '' of the torus and over infinitesimal cylinders around the strings ( see fig.[monostrings ] ) : @xmath212 where the individual contributions from the strings and boundary of the torus read @xmath213 if only monopoles are present , then @xmath214 is periodic and @xmath215 , where the @xmath116 are abelian and satisfy the cocycle conditions ( [ cocycle - ii ] ) . after some algebra",
    "we obtain @xmath216 we parametrize the diagonal matrix as d = e^i _ 3 d^-1 d = i _ 3 [ parametrization ] and arrive at @xmath217 \\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\frac{1}{4 i \\pi^2 } \\sum_{i , j } \\int_{x_i = x_j = 0 } \\varepsilon_{i j k } \\alpha \\tr \\left ( \\left ( r_i ( x + b_j ) ^{-1 } \\partial_k r_i ( x + b_j ) -   r_i ( x ) ^{-1 } \\partial_k r_i ( x ) \\right ) i \\sigma_3 \\right ) d",
    "x^k \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] differentiating equation ( [ cocycle - ii ] ) one sees that the trace term is symmetric in @xmath218 and @xmath219",
    ". therefore we conclude @xmath220 in accordance with the fact that the spatial transition functions are simply given by the functions @xmath221 , see equation ( [ transition - fct-2d ] ) .",
    "the strings do contribute to the instanton number .",
    "we consider a dirac string connecting monopoles .",
    "we argue that this string contributes to the instanton number the sum of monopole charges of @xmath175 monopoles attached to the string . using the parametrisation ( [ parametrization ] ) we can write & = & - 12 a_mag + 12 f_mag + & = & - 12 ( + ) a_mag + 12 ( a_mag ) . integrating over a closed surface @xmath222 surrounding the string the contribution from the second term vanishes .",
    "now we choose a @xmath175 monopole and the dirac string emanating from it .",
    "we introduce coordinates @xmath223 on @xmath222 such that @xmath224 is independent of @xmath225 . the contribution of the string to the instanton number reads _ = - z ( + ) a_mag .",
    "the integral @xmath226 is up to the sign given by the magnetic flux through the dirac string , ie .",
    "it is @xmath227 times the magnetic charge of the @xmath175 monopole .",
    "therefore the contribution of the string to the instanton number is given by @xmath228 .",
    "hence , if the string ends at a @xmath171 monopole then it contributes @xmath229 and , if it ends at a @xmath175 monopole @xmath230 , it will not contribute .",
    "the generalisation to arbitrary strings is straightforward .",
    "after the gauge fixing procedure described in sections 4 and 5 , @xmath0 is independent of time and restricted to the cartan subalgebra .",
    "furthermore , the transition functions become abelian ( upto an element of the weyl group if one has wall defects ) . however , the gauge is not fixed completely , since one must fix the residual gauge freedom related to gauge transformations which preserve the properties of @xmath0 mentioned above .",
    "if we have no walls we may assume that the transition functions have the standard form ( [ simpletrans ] ) . thus we only consider residual gauge transformations which do not change the transition functions .",
    "one may regard this fixing of the transition functions as the first part of our residual gauge fixing .",
    "let us first consider the case considered in chapter 4 , where one has no defects .",
    "here we assume that the defect manifold @xmath88 is empty , in which case @xmath87 is smoothly diagonalisable .",
    "we may also assume that @xmath103 is smoothly restricted to the first weyl chamber .",
    "after the first part of the gauge fixing given in section four the transition functions are abelian .",
    "the residual gauge transformations are @xmath231 where all @xmath41 s are in the cartan subalgebra , @xmath232 is periodic in all spatial directions , and @xmath233 .",
    "clearly these residual gauge transformations have no effect on @xmath0 . accordingly , to fix the gauge we must impose constraints on the _ spatial _ components of the gauge field .",
    "of course , @xmath234 depends on time , whereas the residual gauge transformations under consideration are time - independent .",
    "thus we could impose constraints on @xmath187 for some fixed time , say @xmath235 .",
    "alternatively , if we wish to treat all times on an equal footing we can consider the time - averaged object a_i()=^l_0_0dx_0 a_i(x_0 , ) .    using the result that the transition functions are abelian _ after gauge - fixing , the cartan part of @xmath236 ( or @xmath237 )",
    "may be decomposed into a periodic piece @xmath238 and a contribution @xmath239 , which is linear in the spatial coordinates . if we impose _",
    "t^3 a_i^c , perd^3x /l , i=1,2,3,we fix the gauge freedom with respect to the @xmath240 . here",
    "@xmath241 is the torus obtained by dividing the cartan subalgebra @xmath38 by the lattice @xmath242 . _",
    "if we demand the following relations , we can fix the residual gauge freedom concerning @xmath232 upto an abelian global gauge transformation [ first ] a^c , per_1 = h_1(x_2,x_3),_0^l_1a^c , per_2 dx_1 = h_2(x_3),_0^l_1_0^l_2a^c , per_3dx_1dx_2=h_3,where the functions @xmath243 are cartan subalgebra valued functions of the relevant spatial coordinates .",
    "an alternative to ( [ first ] ) which is symmetric in the spatial variables is simply the coulomb type condition ^c , per()=0 .",
    "we now assume that the defect manifold , @xmath88 , is non - empty .",
    "thus our gauge fixed potential is not well defined for @xmath244 and on the dirac strings joining the defects . while @xmath88 is gauge invariant , the paths taken by the dirac strings are not .",
    "however , one can only change the path of the dirac strings with a _ singular gauge transformation .",
    "the residual gauge transformations considered in the previous subsection were ( implicitly ) assumed to be smooth .",
    "thus it is convenient to separate the residual gauge fixing into two parts .",
    "firstly , one fixes the location of the dirac strings ( which can be viewed as a singular residual gauge fixing ) .",
    "for example consider the case where one only has point - like monopole defects . here",
    "one can take the dirac strings to be straight lines all meeting together in the centre of @xmath101 .",
    "then one repeats the residual gauge fixing of section c.1 , except that now one must exclude a closed set , @xmath245 , containing both the defect manifold @xmath102 and the ( by now fixed ) dirac strings from the relevant integrals in ( [ first ] ) .",
    "_      if we allow for wall defects then we actually have a wider class of residual gauge transformations @xmath246 where @xmath247 , and @xmath248 is an element of the weyl group _ which commutes with all the transition functions.the reason for this extra freedom is that in the cases considered in the previous subsections we could assume that @xmath103 is restricted to the first weyl chamber , and we only considered residual gauge transformations which respected this constraint . _      a.m. polyakov , phys .",
