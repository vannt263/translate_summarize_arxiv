    "after the launch of the spitzer space telescope and the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) satellites the study of the star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies has improved considerably .",
    "the 24@xmath0 m  and 8@xmath0 m  spitzer bands have been proposed as new sfr indicators in galaxies of different types ( e.g. calzetti et al . 2005 ; 2007 ,",
    "alonso - herrero et al .",
    "while the classical h@xmath1  and far - ir ( fir ) emissions are directly linked to the star formation process , the h@xmath1  luminosity is produced by the recombination of photoelectrons and the fir luminosity is produced by the amount of stellar light absorbed by dust , the consideration of both 24@xmath0 m  and 8@xmath0 m  emissions as sfr tracers relies on the observational correlation between the integrated luminosity at these two wavelengths and the extinction  corrected h@xmath1  luminosity .",
    "the relation has been found to hold in a statistically significant number of hii  knots in different galaxies .",
    "calzetti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a correlation between the 24@xmath0 m  and the extinction ",
    "corrected pa@xmath1  luminosities for the central hii  emitting knots in m51 , which holds over more than two orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "a similar correlation was found for the hii  regions in m81 , but with higher dispersion in the low - luminosity range and a larger range of dust opacities in those objects ( prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "these correlations were also confirmed for luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulrigs ) ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "the 8@xmath0 m  emission was also studied as a star formation tracer in m51 and m81 , but higher dispersion was found in the correlation of the 8@xmath0m - h@xmath1  luminosities of hii  regions in these galaxies . a more complete study by calzetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) involving a large galaxy sample shows the ability of the 24@xmath0 m  emission to trace the star formation in galaxies of different types and metallicities ( see also wu et al .",
    "2005 and rela~ no et al .",
    "these relations between dust emission and ionizing luminosity strictly hold only in very dusty hii  regions , where most of the stellar luminosity is reprocessed by dust . for hii  regions with a wider range of dust opacity , kennicutt et al .",
    "( 2007 ) show that a linear combination of the 24@xmath0 m  emission , tracing the obscured star formation , and the observed h@xmath1  luminosity , which would trace the un - absorbed star formation , correlates better than other sfr tracers with the extinction  corrected h@xmath1  luminosity .",
    "this correlation has been confirmed in a large sample of hii  regions by calzetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and more recently for galaxies by zhu et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the previously mentioned studies assume a direct correspondence between the 24@xmath0 m  and h@xmath1  emissions .",
    "but although a considerable analysis has been carried out from a statistical point of view , little has been done to corroborate the spatial correlation of the emissions proposed as tracers of the star formation , and the geometries of the gas and dust relative to the position where the stars actually form within hii  emitting knots . using spatially resolved observations we are able to test the assumptions upon which the previous studies rest .",
    "the study of the emission distribution within an hii  region at the wavelengths that trace the sfr and the relation with the classical components of the hii  regions ( central ob stars , ionized gas , photodissociation region ( pdr ) and molecular gas ) offer an opportunity to test the hypotheses that are assumed in the statistical studies .",
    "such an analysis , carried out in a set of giant hii  regions at different evolutionary stages , can help to test the basis for the results derived from the previous statistical correlations .",
    "m33 is an especially appropriate object because it offers a sample of giant hii  regions spanning wide ranges in luminosity and size .",
    "the distance of the galaxy ( 840  kpc ; freedman et al .",
    "1991 ) allows an intermediate spatial resolution at the infrared wavelength range ( at the distance of m33 , the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) has a linear resolution of @xmath220pc at 24@xmath0 m , which is @xmath210 times smaller than the typical sizes of giant hii  regions ) . among the brightest hii  regions in m33",
    "there is a wide range of properties which allows us to select a complete set of giant hii  regions covering different luminosities and evolutionary stages .",
    "for example , ic131 contains a compact hii  region , ic131-west , and ngc  604 is a more evolved and dispersed high luminous hii  region .",
    "ngc  604 is of special interest .",
    "it is the brightest luminous hii  region in m33 and the second most luminous nearby hii  region after 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "its ionized gas shows a complex morphology of cavities , shells and filaments that testify to the large amount of kinetic energy involved in the interior of the region .",
    "relevant to this paper , the stellar content has been analyzed with filter imaging ( e.g. , hunter et al .",
    "1996 , drissen at al . 1993 ) and spectroscopically ( e.g. , pellerin 2006 , terlevich et al . 1996 , gonzlez - delgado et al .",

    "the size of the region and its evolutionary stage make it very suitable for analyzing the correspondence of the ir spitzer emission and the location of knots of star formation within the hii  region .",
    "we study a set of luminous hii  regions in the nearby galaxy m33 combining data at different wavelengths : 24@xmath0 m , 8@xmath0 m  from spitzer , @xmath2 154 nm , @xmath2 232 nm from galex , h@xmath1  and r - band ground based data and h@xmath1  and h@xmath3  hst data . for two of the most luminous hii  regions in the sample",

    "the study of the components of the interstellar dust is improving considerably since the launch of spitzer ( e.g. draine & li 2007 , lebouteiller et al .",
    "the general model of the interstellar dust suggests the existence of three different components : large grains ( emitting at wavelengths @xmath16 50@xmath0 m ) , very small grains ( vsg ) ( emitting at @xmath16 10@xmath0 m ) and pah molecules with emission at concentrated features in the 3 - 15@xmath0 m  region ( dsert et al 1990 ; draine 2003 ) . in this general picture",
    "we would expect that the emission corresponding to the 24@xmath0 m  mips band will be related to the emission of the vsg , while the 8@xmath0 m  irac band will include part of the pah emission features .",
    "the relation of the dust model components and the infrared ( ir ) emission in the irac and mips bands has been recently studied by draine & li ( 2007 ) . while the vsg are heated by single photons from the stellar radiation field producing a broad temperature distribution and",
    "are believed to be located close to the central stellar cluster in star forming regions ( cesarsky et al . 1996 , lebouteiller et al . 2007 ) ; the pah grains can be of various sizes emitting at different bands ( draine & li 2001 ) and their emission is seen to peak in the interfaces between the hii  regions and the molecular clouds and pdrs ( cesarsky et al . 1996 ) .    in this section ,",
    "we analyze the emission at 8@xmath0 m  and 24@xmath0 m  in the interior of a set of hii  regions ( ngc  604 , ngc  595 , ngc  588 , ngc  592 and ic131 ) and relate them to the uv and h@xmath1  emission observed in the hii  regions .",
    "ngc  604 and ngc  595 , which are more extensively studied objects than the rest , will be discussed separately below ( see  5 ) .",
    "we first analyze the spatial correspondence between the 24@xmath0 m  and h@xmath1  emissions . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show continuum - subtracted h@xmath1  images for the selected hii  regions with 24@xmath0 m  contours overlaid .",
    "there is a clear spatial correlation between h@xmath1  and 24@xmath0 m  emission in all hii  regions of our sample .",
    "the most luminous h@xmath1  knots correspond spatially to the most luminous ones at 24@xmath0 m  and the h@xmath1  morphology is perfectly traced by the 24@xmath0 m  emission at lower resolution : the most luminous knots at 24@xmath0 m  and h@xmath1  are located at the same position within ngc  588 , the same is seen in ngc  592 , and ic131-west , a very concentrated h@xmath1  knot , shows the same highly concentrated morphology at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "the same spatial correspondence is seen for ngc  604 in figure  [ fig2 ] ( lower left panel ) , where the h@xmath1  emission at 6  resolution is compared to the 24@xmath0 m  emission . in ngc  595",
    "the agreement is not so good : the 24@xmath0 m  emission peaks in between the two central h@xmath1  maxima , which could be due to a higher extinction at this particular position within the region ( see figure  18 in bosch et al .",
    "2002 ) , but in general the 24@xmath0 m  emission follows the same shell - like distribution as h@xmath1  in this region .",
    "the strong correspondence between the emission at both wavelengths confirms the general trend observed in other galaxies ( e.g. calzetti et al .",
    "2005 ; prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2005 , alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2006 , prescott et al . 2007 ) and in nearby hii  regions ( churchwell et al . 2006 ; watson et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the good spatial correlation between 24@xmath0 m  and h@xmath1  emissions shows that the dust emitting at 24@xmath0 m  would be predominantly heated by the emission coming from the ob stars within the hii  regions .",
    "in this situation , the 24@xmath0 m  emission radiated by the dust , that has previously absorbed the light coming from the stars , would be more related to the absorbed h@xmath1  luminosity than to the observed h@xmath1  luminosity in the region . in order to test this hypothesis",
    "we have produced a map of absorbed h@xmath1  luminosity of ngc  604 ( figure  [ fig2 ] , right panel ) using the following method .",
    "we have obtained a map of the gas extinction using hst continuum subtracted h@xmath1  and h@xmath3  images ( the derivation of this map will be explained below in   [ s5 ] ) , then the extinction map was used to derive an extinction  corrected h@xmath1  luminosity map of the region . assuming a color excess of e(b@xmath17v ) = 0.07  mag ( van den bergh 2000 ) and cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) extinction law with @xmath18=3.1 , we derive a contribution of a(h@xmath1)=0.17 for the foreground galactic extinction .",
    "the h@xmath1  luminosity absorbed in the hii  region will be the difference between the total extinction ",
    "corrected h@xmath1  luminosity and the h@xmath1  luminosity corrected for the foreground galactic extinction .",
    "the result is shown in the right panel in figure  [ fig2 ] with 24@xmath0 m  emission contours overlaid .",
    "in spite of the relatively low extinction in ngc  604 we can clearly see that the absorbed h@xmath1  luminosity ( right panel ) correlates better with the 24@xmath0 m  emission than the observed h@xmath1  luminosity ( left panel ) .",
    "this result qualitatively confirms previous results showing that the 24@xmath0 m  is directly linked to the _ extincted _ star formation ( kennicutt et al .",

    "we show the continuum - subtracted h@xmath1  images with 8@xmath0 m  emission contours overlaid .",
    "in the outskirts of the hii  regions the 8@xmath0 m  emission traces the filamentary structure , delineating in some cases the h@xmath1  filaments and shells ( e.g. in ngc  595 and ngc  588 and ngc  604 in figure  2 , upper left panel ) . in the central part of the hii  regions the 8@xmath0 m  maxima is in general displaced from the h@xmath1  maxima ( e.g. ngc  595 and western part of ngc  604 ) , while the maxima at 24@xmath0 m  coincide with h@xmath1  maxima .",
    "the morphology suggests that the 8@xmath0 m  emission is more related to the pdr than to the location of the ionizing stars or the ionized gas .",
    "differences between 24@xmath0 m  and 8@xmath0 m  emissions within extragalactic hii  regions were also suggested by helou et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for ngc  300 , but the linear resolution of their data ( a factor of 2.5 lower than ours ) did not allow them to make a firm statement about this .",
    "similar results related to the distribution of the 24@xmath0 m , 8@xmath0 m  and h@xmath1  emission as these shown here for our set of hii  regions have been reported for galactic hii  regions ( e. g. churchwell et al .",
    "2006 ; watson et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "as one would expect the uv stellar emission follows a different distribution from the dust emission at the 24@xmath0 m  and 8@xmath0 m  spitzer bands , and from the emission of the ionized gas at h@xmath1 .",
    "the uv stellar radiation is generally absorbed by the dust , thus we would not expect to observe uv emission from the stars and dust emission in the same positions within the star forming regions . in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    ", we show the continuum subtracted h@xmath1  images for our set of hii  regions with fuv contours overlaid .",
    "the h@xmath1  emission , in general , surrounds the fuv emission in all hii  regions of our sample .",
    "this effect is much better appreciated in the shell - like hii  regions such as ngc  595 , ic 131 , ngc  588 and in ngc  604 ( figure  2 , upper right panel ) .",
    "the exception to the trend is ic131-west .",
    "this knot shows very highly concentrated emission at all wavelengths , it is probably a compact hii  region but the extinction derived from different methods ( see table  2 ) reveals a low dust content in the knot .",
    "the existence of uv emission in the center of the shell - like hii  regions was also observed by calzetti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for m51 and thilker et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for m33 in a general study of the uv emission across the galaxy .",
    "the trend observed in all these figures , with the exception of ic131-west , seems to be a _ stratification _ of the different emissions . from inside to the outer border of the region : fuv emission is located at the center , then h@xmath1  and 24@xmath0 m  emissions spatially correlate and both of them are surrounded by the low intensity filamentary 8@xmath0 m  emission structure .",
    "the best representative cases of the stratification are ngc  595 and ngc  604 . for these regions we have also analyzed co molecular emission and we will comment on the results later .",
    "we have obtained aperture fluxes for our set of hii  regions in all the wavelengths available in this study .",
    "the apertures used to extract the fluxes in each hii  region ( column 4 in table  1 ) were selected to include the total h@xmath1  emission in our images . background contamination was eliminated using concentric annuli of 2535  width and internal radii of 2545 , depending on the aperture size selected for each hii  region .",
    "the observed h@xmath1  luminosities are given in column 9 of table  1 .",
    "based on the noise of the h@xmath1  image and the aperture size for each hii  region we estimated uncertainties in the derived h@xmath1  luminosities to be in the range of 4%-12% .",

    "we show that an instantaneous burst of sf is a better approximation for our objects and we present the corresponding sfs calibrations for a burst of age 4  myr .",
    "the detailed study presented here using high - resolution data allows us to disentangle the spatial correspondence between the 24@xmath0 m  and 8@xmath0 m  emissions , which have been recently proposed as tracers of the sfr , and the location where the stars form .",
    "this study shows that the assumptions on which the statistical studies rely are valid and that the conclusions inferred from them also hold at small galactic scales . in spite of this ,",
