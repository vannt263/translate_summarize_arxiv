    "we present a multipole method to search for a characteristic anisotropic flux of neutrinos from dark matter annihilation in the galactic halo .",

    "@xmath57 is the total number of events in the data sample and @xmath78 is the dirac - delta - distribution .",
    "since the median angular resolution of the events ( @xmath53 ) is much smaller than the anisotropy to search for , the usage of dirac - delta - distributions is justified .",
    "coefficients with negative @xmath73 do not provide additional information , because the sky map is described by a real function , leading to @xmath79 , and a fixed relation between @xmath80 and @xmath81  @xcite .",

    "there is a clear separation from the origin .",
    "also , a clear preferred phase can also be observed , which corresponds to the orientation of the expected anisotropy in the sky .",
    "this phase is the same as the preferred phase for the sky maps with partial signal ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "furthermore , a linear dependency between the signal strength @xmath85 and the mean power @xmath94 can be seen .",
    "[ fig : alm_abs_sig ]    in practice the number of events @xmath57 in the map is limited .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath70 has a statistical error , which depends on the total number of events in the sky map @xmath57 and weakly on the signal fraction @xmath85 . for the value @xmath95 of this analysis",

    "for the pure background case most of the power is contained in the coefficients @xmath97 , related to the pure zenith structure . because the background was assumed to be isotropic in ra all coefficients with @xmath98 are at noise level .",
    "the statistical noise level in the map is of the order of @xmath99 and corresponds to the width of the distribution , as shown in figure  [ fig : example_coefb ] and figure  [ fig : example_coefa ] .    from equation  ( [ eq : spherical_harmonics ] ) one can see that spherical harmonics with @xmath100 are independent of ra and thus purely depend on declination .",
    "the @xmath97 coefficients have an absolute value larger than the noise level that means they contain power .",
    "these coefficients describe the full declination structure , that is mainly influenced by the declination - dependent acceptance and the declination - dependent variation of the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "furthermore it was found that there is no preferred phase in any coefficient for background .",
    "for pure signal ( figure  [ fig : alm_abs_bgd ] , right ) there is also power in coefficients with @xmath98 , resulting from the characteristic anisotropy of the signal .",
    "it was found that all coefficients that have a power larger than the noise level also have a preferred phase . the characteristic checkered pattern in the coefficients results from the observation of just one hemisphere @xmath101 , leading to a suppression of coefficients with even @xmath102 , that correspond to a symmetric spherical harmonic with respect to the equator .",
    "from figure  [ fig : alm_abs_bgd ] ( right panel ) it becomes obvious that coefficients with small @xmath71 and @xmath73 carry most power .",
    "this is due to the large - scale anisotropy of the line - of - sight integral ( see figure  [ fig : jofpsianisotropy ] ) . in analogy to the relation of @xmath71 and the characteristic angular scale of the structure , @xmath73 is related to the characteristic angular scale in ra , thus small @xmath73 represent large structures in ra and large @xmath73 represent small structures in ra .",
    "the test statistic ( @xmath103 ) to separate signal from background combines the phase information and the power of a complex coefficient into one value .",

    "this projected expansion coefficient has the following advantages .",
    "first @xmath107 is proportional to the power of the expansion coefficient .",
    "second , the most sensitive direction is the axis of the preferred phase , and the value of the projection gets smaller , the more the phase differs .",
    "this results in negative values for @xmath107 , if the phase differs more than @xmath108 , indicating that the anisotropy is in the opposite direction of the expectation .    using these projected expansion coefficients",

    ". the definition of the test statistic is motivated by a weighted @xmath116-function .",

    "has been estimated from the burkert profile .",
    "the gray band describes the natural scale if all dark matter consists of wimps and the gray upper region is excluded by the unitarity bound  @xcite . ]",
    "the most stringent exclusion limits from @xmath5-ray telescopes in the energy - range of this analysis are set by h.e.s.s  , with an analysis focusing on the galactic center , and fermi  @xcite with an analysis focusing at dwarf galaxies .",
    "these limits are about two orders of magnitude more stringent .",
    "however it is important to note , that the systematic uncertainties for @xmath5-ray and neutrino telescopes are of very different nature .",
    "also @xmath5 telescopes have the highest sensitivity for the soft channel and vice versa , smallest sensitivity for the hard channels .",
    "the halo profile dependencies in this analysis are very small compared to the galactic center analysis of icecube .",
    "this can be seen by comparing this analysis with a galactic center search , that focuses on the central part of the galaxy .",
    "the sensitivity for the @xmath44 annihilation channel of the icecube-79 galactic center analysis described in  @xcite and the sensitivity of this analysis are compared in figure  [ fig : comp_gc ] .",
    "the bands represent the model uncertainties determined from burkert and nfw profile , whereas nfw is used as baseline .",
    "it is clearly visible that the halo profile uncertainties are much smaller for a halo analysis ( compare figure  [ fig : jofpsi ] ) , while the overall sensitivity of the two approaches are remarkably similar .",
    "we have presented a competitive analysis technique to search for characteristic anisotropies by using a multipole expansion of the neutrino arrival direction sky map .",
    "it was found that the multipole analysis is a sensitive and robust analysis method , that has the feature to reduce systematic uncertainties in an easy way .",
    "we applied the analysis to one year of data taken with the icecube detector in its the nearly completed detector configuration .",
    "the search for a neutrino flux , resulting from dark matter annihilation , has found no significant deviation from the background expectation .",
    "exclusion limits on the self - annihilation cross - section @xmath0 were calculated approaching @xmath142 .",
    "the resulting exclusion limits are more stringent than the predecessor analysis of ic22 data in a wide parameter range .",
    "furthermore the extracted limits come close to limits from @xmath5-experiments , that also focus on the outer galactic halo , for hard annihilation channels and large dark matter masses .",
    "the presented analysis , focusing on the galactic halo , is very robust against halo profile uncertainties compared to analyses targeting the galactic center or dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( compare figure  [ fig : jofpsi ] ) .",
