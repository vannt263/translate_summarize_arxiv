    "the ams-02 experiment reports an excess of the positron over the cr background upto energies @xmath0350 gev @xcite , consistent with the positron excess reported by pamela upto 100 gev @xcite . in either experiment there is no corresponding excess seen in the anti - protons flux over the cr background . to explain the positron excess of ams-02 and pamela interms of @xmath8-@xmath9 gev scale dark matter annihilation ,",
    "would require the annihilation cross - section of @xmath10 of order of @xmath11 @xcite , but no annihilation into baryons or @xmath12 channels ( to avoid a line spectrum in the positron signal ) .",
    "dark matter with relic density consistent with planck @xcite and wmap @xcite observations arises in the neutralino sector of supersymmetric extension of the standard model . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ,",
    "the heavy dark matter in the tev scale can be winos @xcite . in mssm",
    "the annihilation of wino dark matter is primarily into @xmath13 and gives a significant anti - proton flux , which is not seen by pamela or ams-02 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we construct a leptophilic dark matter by considering an @xmath14 extension of mssm , where @xmath15 gauge symmetry .",
    "it is known that in standard model , one can have anomaly free gauged symmetry @xcite if the gauge charges are as following , @xmath16 leptophilic dark matter from @xmath17 extension was considered to study the baryon asymmetry @xcite .",
    "we choose the @xmath18 symmetry to get @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the final states dark matter annihilation and to avoid hard positrons and anti - protons in the final states .",
    "the @xmath18 symmetry is also a natural frame work for constructing the see - saw model , which can explain the large @xmath19 mixing in the light neutrinos @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath18 gauge boson @xmath5 is very light , few gev , then this extended model can explain the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment @xcite .",
    "in supersymmetry one has to introduce two extra superfields @xmath20 and @xmath21 to cancel the anomalies from the @xmath18 gauginos .",
    "the scalar components of @xmath20 and @xmath21 also provide masses to the @xmath18 gauge boson @xmath5 .",
    "the mass of @xmath5 , @xmath22 is greater than 2 tev from recent lhc searches @xcite .",
    "there can be kinetic mixing between the field strength of the superfields @xcite .",
    "this gives the kinetic mixing between @xmath23 and @xmath24 gauge fields and also a mixing between gauginos @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath22 is much larger than @xmath27 , the kinetic mixing is required to be small .",
    "this in term means that the mixing between @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the d - term of the higgs potential , is small .",
    "there is no significant contribution to the tree level lightest cp even higgs mass from the @xmath30 and @xmath31 sector .",
    "the dark matter is a combination of the @xmath32 gaugino , @xmath26 and the fermionic partner of @xmath30 and @xmath31 . by taking @xmath33",
    ", we can make the thermal relic density close to the planck observed value of @xmath34 at 68@xmath35 cl@xcite . in the early universe",
    "the center of mass energy is not exactly coincident with the mass of @xmath5 in the propagator , but in the present era the dark matter velocity is @xmath36 and we have annihilation close to the resonance peak @xcite . by parameterizing the dark matter mass in terms of @xmath22 as , @xmath37 and choosing @xmath38 , we obtain the required boost factor of 100 needed to explain the ams-02 flux @xcite .",
    "the particle content of the model is described in section-[sec2 ] , where we give the superpotential , the kinetic mixing and neutral part of the scalar potential . in section-[sec3 ] we discuss the mass matrices of cp - odd scalar , cp - even scalar and the @xmath39 neutralino mass matrix arising from gauge eigenstates , @xmath40 . in section [ sec6 ] we give the numerical results for scalar and neutralino masses .",
    "we also compute the thermal relic density at decoupling , the boost factor of our model in the present era with breit - wigner resonance and direct detection constraints .",

    "we study the supersymmetric model of the @xmath41 gauge theory where , @xmath42 .",
    "the particle content of the theory is given in table.([ptc ] ) .",
    "in addition to the mssm , we need to add two fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 to cancel the anomalies from gauginos of @xmath14 .",

    "the cross - section of dark matter scattering off target nucleus is as follows , @xmath90 where the reduced mass of nucleon is @xmath91 .",

    "@xmath101 is the product of the higgs - quark coupling of mssm and @xmath100 .",
    "if the lightest cp - even higgs is the propagator , then neutralino - higgs coupling is highly suppressed and hence @xmath102 and cross - section becomes @xmath103 .",
    "if the propagator is the heavy cp - even higgs , the cross - section is even smaller .",
    "because the higgs - quark coupling is suppressed as the heavy higgs has dominant fraction from @xmath30 and @xmath31 only and less from @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in this case",
    ", @xmath104 will be @xmath105 .",
    "hence cross - section remain well below the exclusion limit of xenon100 @xcite .",
    "we provide a susy model of leptophilic dark matter to explain the excess of positrons seen at ams-02 and pamela .",
    "in addition there is no antiproton excess over the cr background .",
    "we consider @xmath2 extension of mssm where the dark matter is a combination of @xmath14 gaugino and the corresponding higgsinos . by choosing the dark matter mass @xmath106",
    ", we get a resonance enhancement of the annihilation cross - section @xmath107 in the present era correspond to the freeze - out cross - section .",
    "this model provides the most economical extension of susy model to explain the positrons excess seen in ams-02 and pamela , consistent with other constraints from direct and indirect dark matter observations .",
