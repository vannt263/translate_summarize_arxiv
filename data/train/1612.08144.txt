    "in the distribution of molecular mass across the milky way galaxy , dense molecular clumps are the sites where the gas begins its gravitational collapse and produces new stars .",
    "several studies have shown that these clumps not only create individual stars , but that many of these stars formed together as clusters @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the processes within and characteristics of clumps that form star clusters .",
    "this process of star formation is a driving force behind galactic evolution , and describes the global conversion of gas into stars described by the kennicutt - schmidt ( ks ) relations @xcite .    considering this significant effect on galactic evolution",
    ", it is important to understand the physical conditions and kinematics within these dense clumps in their prestellar phase . until recently ,",
    "unbiased studies of molecular emission at millimeter wavelengths have typically been for a small number of sources @xcite , while others have chosen sources based on emission at other wavelengths @xcite , creating the possibility of statistical biases .",
    "due partly to these shortcomings , there has been little consensus on the basic formation mechanism of stars .",
    "recently , however , this statistical limitation has begun to be addressed in several large - scale surveys of molecular line emission in the galactic plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among these , the galactic census of high- and medium - mass protostars ( champ * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) was specifically developed in order to better resolve such issues . with its large - scale , complete ,",
    "unbiased , uniform , sensitive , and multi - wavelength coverage , champ gives the properties of these dense molecular clumps and the stars that are produced from them .",
    "it also allows us to identify the evolutionary stages , and for the first time derive the time scale of the stages with a demographic analysis .",
    "some of the champ data include molecular emission lines with hyperfine - split components , such as hcn and n@xmath8h@xmath9 . by using hyperfine - split lines ,",
    "spatially resolved maps of physical conditions and chemistry can be created .",
    "these maps can be compared with hco@xmath9 and other species where simple rotational line analysis also yields abundances and kinematics ( see paper i ) .    from the champ survey , byf40 ( part of region 6 , at galactic coordinates near @xmath10 = 284.0 , @xmath11 = 0.8 )",
    "was selected for this initial analysis . while byf40 is one of the more distant clouds ( @xmath126.6kpc ) in the champ sample , it is otherwise fairly typical of the brighter hcn - emitting clouds .",
    "our objective was to measure and analyze the hcn column density of byf40 in the survey , examine the science leading from these results , and to create usable code that would allow us to expand this analysis to rest of the survey .",
    "in paper i we described the observational setup with the mopra radio telescope , including the configuration of the mops spectrometer , which collects data simultaneously on multiple transitions within an 8 ghz segment of the 3 mm band . in phase",
    "i of the observing ( 20042007 ) , mopra was used to collect data on several `` dense gas tracer '' spectral lines in the 8593 ghz range , including hcn @xmath13=1@xmath140 .",
    "paper i fully describes the observing and data reduction procedures , including mopra s on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping capabilities , the livedata / gridzilla software pipeline , and other details .",
    "a brief summary of these procedures is outlined next .",
    "byf40 contains 7 subclumps , @xmath15 , across an area of @xmath120.2@xmath16 , with masses of a few @xmath17 @xmath18 m@xmath19 each ( see figure [ 3color ] and table 1 ) .",
    "the raw data were processed with the standard livedata / gridzilla pipeline . at 88.6 ghz",
    "the various telescope efficiencies are essentially the same as for the hco@xmath20 line at 89.2 ghz , as reported in paper i. four otf fields of size @xmath21 arcmin each took about 3 hours to complete with two orthogonal otf mapping passes , and adjacent fields were composited in gridzilla .",
    "the final product is a calibrated spectral line data cube ( @xmath22 ) converted to the @xmath23 scale , with a mass of 2000 - 7000 m@xmath19 per clump ( based on the hco@xmath9 analysis ) .",
    "normally , such data cubes would then be amenable to moment analysis , but the hyperfine lines contain additional information and artificially widen the otherwise gaussian profile .",
    "we describe our alternative hyperfine approach next .",
    "the hcn @xmath13=1@xmath140 line is not a simple transition , since the @xmath24n nucleus has a large nuclear quadrupole moment which induces a hyperfine splitting of the rotational levels .",
    "thus , species such as hcn and n@xmath8h@xmath9 have hyperfine structure which is not well served by the methods used in paper i. in this case we have 3 hyperfine components , which will have intrinsic line strengths in the optically thin limit of 1:5:3 , assuming they are formed in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "radiative transfer analysis of all three components allows solutions for both the lines excitation temperature ( @xmath5 ) and optical depth ( @xmath6 ) , but such treatments exist in only a few software packages , not all of which are easy to use .",
    "the pyspeckit package @xcite was used for the hyperfine line fitting of the byf40 hcn @xmath25 data cube we chose as a test area for our code development , and has the advantage of being scriptable in a modern computing environment , as well as having a built - in tool for fitting the model across all spectra in a cube .",
    "assuming lte , it solves for the common parameters of all hyperfine components .    in order to improve the fit quality",
    ", the original fits cube input for the package was binned by two spectral channels and convolved from an original resolution of 40@xmath26 to 60@xmath26 .",
    "once a minimum s / n threshold is set for the hyperfine fitting , pyspeckit yields separate 2d maps of the excitation temperature @xmath5 , opacity @xmath6 , mean velocity @xmath3 , and velocity dispersion @xmath27@xmath28 , as well as error maps for each parameter map . a sample fit is shown in figure [ spectra ] , while the parameter maps appear in figures [ vlsr][tex ] .      after obtaining the parameter maps and uncertainties as outputs from pyspeckit , the column density @xmath29 was evaluated using a mix of c - shell and miriad @xcite software . @xmath6 and @xmath5 were measured in each voxel and then converted into @xmath30 using the equation    @xmath31    here , @xmath32 refers to the partition function , @xmath33 is the energy of the upper level above the ground state of the @xmath34@xmath14@xmath35 transition , @xmath36 is the energy of the transition , and @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the derived @xmath30 map is shown in figure [ ncol ] , and has a flatter distribution compared to the overlayed @xmath0 contours .    under traditional methods , the @xmath38 factor for @xmath39co",
    "is often used to estimate column densities with a simple linear conversion .",
    "the accuracy of such conversions have frequently been debated , and recent work by our group @xcite has shown that , in the case of co at least , both the lines @xmath5 and @xmath6 need to be properly accounted for , and must be self - consistently measured .    in this paper , we calculate the uncertainty in @xmath30 by propagating all of the formal fit errors , and applying the constraints @xmath5 > 2.73 k and @xmath6 > 0 on the pyspeckit solutions . by using the error images and the output images together , relative errors were also determined for several intermediate quantities in the calculation , and for @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath3 values range from 810 km / s , @xmath4 = 1.22.2 km / s , @xmath5 = 49k , and @xmath6 = 0.52.5 .      in table 1",
    "we give the observed and physical parameters of the byf40 clumps used to derive these results .",
    "the values appear similar to table 4 from paper i , due to the high correlation present between hcn and hco@xmath9 in the clump .",
    "additionally , figure [ hcovshcn ] shows that there is a high correlation between the integrated intensities of hcn and hco@xmath9 .",
    "this can be seen in the [ byf40 ] mopra map , where the blue of hco@xmath9 occurs frequently in proportion to the green hcn , yielding the overall cyan color in this rendering .",
    "integrating the column density map across each clump gives the total clump mass , and a total mass column measurement across the map ( @xmath40 = 57,000 m@xmath41 ) , assuming an intrinsic hcn abundance of 10@xmath42 , the same as for hco@xmath9 .",
    "this result is roughly twice as large as the 24,000 - 37,000 m@xmath41 value obtained when converting the @xmath0 using a standard linear conversion .",
    "this is caused by significant areas in region 6 of low @xmath7 and low @xmath5 , but very high @xmath6 .",
    "it should be noted that this is an overall result , where some measured clumps are more or less massive than the value linearly converted from @xmath7 .",
    "this shows that when simple @xmath7 scaling is used to estimate the mass in a clump , the mass can be substantially underestimated , and suggests that there is more dense gas in the clumps not engaging in massive star formation than previously measured .",

    "it is often challenging to evaluate equation ( 1 ) , since one needs ways to separately estimate @xmath6 and @xmath5 . in the literature",
    "it is often assumed , in the radiative transfer equation @xmath60 that @xmath6 @xmath61 1 , so that @xmath6 can be approximated by @xmath62/@xmath5 .",
    "then with the excitation - dependent terms in equation ( 1 ) approximated as being linear in @xmath5 ( for reasonably high t@xmath63 ) , @xmath29 can be obtained via @xmath64 so that @xmath6 and @xmath5 are not explicitly required , unless the emission is in the low-@xmath5 and/or high-@xmath6 regime . however , if we take advantage of hyperfine - line splitting and assume the components are formed in lte , @xmath6 and @xmath5 can be obtained directly , along with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , allowing a more direct measure of @xmath29 , and mass estimates to be obtained from relative abundance maps or vice versa .",
    "figure [ 3fit ] shows that when calculating the mass estimate , relying on a simple @xmath7 scaling may substantially underestimate the mass of gas in these clumps , especially where @xmath7 is low ( but still at reasonably high s / n ) , @xmath5 is low , but @xmath6 is high .",
    "figure [ 3fit ] therefore shows exactly why one needs to consider the low-@xmath5 or high-@xmath6 case when evaluating @xmath29 in cold molecular clouds .",
    "it also shows that the uncertainty measure of @xmath29 from our method is low enough that the numerous high-@xmath6 pixels are not noise - dominated .",
    "thus , there is a significant amount of dense gas in these massive clumps that is not obviously engaged in massive star formation , as traced ( e.g. ) by br@xmath65 emission or bright ( high-@xmath5 ) molecular lines .",
    "these hyperfine results allow us to compare the column densities and kinematics of hcn as presented here with the hco@xmath9 from paper i , with the n@xmath8h@xmath9 from @xcite , and with other unpublished data on region 6/byf40 .",
    "several different molecular tracers in these clouds , such as hcn , @xmath66co , and hco@xmath9 , seem to have a similar @xmath13=1@xmath140 morphology and distribution , as demonstrated in figures [ mopra ] and [ hcovshcn ] , while @xcite shows similarities between hcn @xmath13=3@xmath142 and hco@xmath9 @xmath13=3@xmath142 .",
    "however , as can be seen in figures [ 3color ] and [ hcovsn2hp ] , the n@xmath8h@xmath9 @xmath13=1@xmath140 has a very different distribution .",
    "this disparity among n@xmath8h@xmath9 and other molecular species is similar to the results of @xcite , who were one of the first to find chemical discrepancies between hco@xmath9 and n@xmath8h@xmath9 ; it has also been reported in other contexts , such as @xcite .    since hco+ and hcn",
    "are very tightly correlated in byf 40 , the correlation between hco+ and br@xmath65 seen in @xcite must now extend to hcn and @xmath66co as well .",
    "this demonstrates that the ratio of n@xmath8h@xmath9 emission to that of the other species ( including hcn ) must be temperature- and/or ionisation - sensitive , while a similar chemical origin is shared between hcn , @xmath66co , and hco@xmath9 .",
    "indeed , in contrast to hco@xmath9 and hcn , n@xmath8h@xmath9 tends to trace cooler , quiescent gas and must therefore express dissimilar chemical behaviour to the warm , energetic gas traced by hco@xmath9 , hcn , and @xmath66co that is present within byf 40 .    in the case of @xmath66co",
    ", this ionisation - sensitivity may not be so surprising .",
    "@xcite noted that hco@xmath9 , conventionally thought of as a cold and dense gas tracer , is unexpectedly well - correlated with myso photospheric tracers ( i.e. , br@xmath65 ) .",
    "we now see that hcn shows the same relationship with , which is perhaps even more surprising given that it is a neutral species .",
    "hcn is assumed to be a cornerstone of the dense - gas kennicutt - schmidt ( ks ) star formation relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and @xmath0 should be a better tracer of the dense gas column most directly engaged in active star formation than are lower density tracers like co or hi .",
    "therefore , the idea that hcn is measuring the same thing as br@xmath65 ( a presumably direct tracer of star formation activity ) , calls into question the entire basis of the hcn version of the ks relations .",
    "we have used the hcn analysis to show that @xmath7 @xmath67 @xmath29 is not true , especially at small @xmath7 .",
    "this is very important for the rest of the argument about the ks relation , which says that @xmath68 @xmath67 @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is some power .",
    "we showed that in byf40 , @xmath0 = const * @xmath1 .",
    "but we showed in @xcite that @xmath1 = const * @xmath71 .",
    "this is not as tight as the hcn / hco@xmath9 connection , but it is significant .",
    "br@xmath65 comes primarily from hii regions , which are ionized only by massive young stars , providing a relatively direct link between the observable line luminosity and the recent star formation rate .",
    "we therefore show that @xmath0 is proportional ( in the log ) to sfr as traced by ( e.g. ) @xmath72 or @xmath73 . in summary",
    ", the br@xmath65-@xmath0 correlation suggests that hcn is a star - formation - driven feedback indicator .",
    "now consider the masses .",
    "hcn is the canonical `` dense gas tracer , '' so by convention , it is widely assumed to trace the mass involved in sf more directly than co. ( e.g. see * ? ? ? * and references therein . )",
    "this was also the justification for using @xmath0 in the original linear @xcite @xmath73-@xmath0 version of the ks law in external galaxies .",
    "the canonical assumption is therefore : @xmath0 @xmath67 @xmath74 .",
    "we contend that the @xcite interpretation of the ks law is invalid .",
    "the linear correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath68 does not link star formation and dense gas mass .",
    "instead , the hcn luminosity is driven directly by stellar feedback and is therefore a direct tracer of star formation .",
    "therefore , if hcn traces @xmath75 instead of @xmath76 , the @xcite result fails to establish a `` dense gas '' ks law and instead is a result of hcn excitation in the presence of sf .",
    "more generally , and especially at low @xmath7 , hcn strongly does @xmath77 trace mass ( and is not even fitted by a power law ) .",
    "n@xmath8h@xmath9 s poor correlation with hco@xmath9 shown in figure [ hcovsn2hp ] supports our argument that hco@xmath9 and hcn do not trace dense gas . to establish what the `` dense gas '' ks law really looks like",
    ", we must use a different method than just measuring @xmath0 to find @xmath74 , although instead it may be possible to use @xmath0 or @xmath1 to measure @xmath75 .    despite these arguments ,",
    "our sample size is quite small , and our conclusions are tentative .",
    "however , once we apply the same analysis to the rest of the champ hcn data ( schap et al .",
    ", in prep ) , we will have a much stronger statistical base over which to examine these arguments .    in the context of our column density results",
    ", we can conjecture that , should the existence of large masses of cold , non - starforming gas be confirmed , the normalisation of the ks relations could be shifted strongly towards higher mass / lower sfr in the @xmath78(gas)-@xmath78(sfr ) plane .",
    "this would consequently lengthen the gas depletion timescale by a correspondingly large factor .",
    "the next step will be to apply the methods outlined in this paper to hcn maps for the rest of the 303 champ clumps .",
    "once the analysis of the hcn is complete it can be extended to other species , such as the n@xmath8h@xmath9 data . from there , column density and relative abundance maps can be calculated using these results , giving new mass estimates for these massive clumps , and will give a strong statistical basis for testing the physical underpinnings of the ks relations .",
    "using the pyspeckit package , we developed a new pipeline for hcn hyperfine line data analysis , and tested it on one of the regions of the champ project , containing the 7 clumps that are part of the source byf40 .",
    "the intent is that this pipeline can next be used to analyse the rest of the regions of the survey . following the full evaluation of hcn",
    ", the analysis can be extended to the champ n@xmath8h@xmath9 data and more .",
    "we also examine the science derived from the hcn analysis , where the hyperfine fitting simultaneously and directly gives solutions for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 at each pixel . using these results",
    ", @xmath30 can be directly measured across the mapped area , without having to convert from @xmath0 and make assumptions about @xmath6 or @xmath5 .",
    "assuming an hcn abundance , we also compute the 7 clump masses .",
    "the total mass of byf40 is calculated to be @xmath1257,000 m@xmath19 , roughly twice as large as the 24,000 - 37,000 m@xmath41 value obtained from converting the @xmath0 in the traditional manner , due largely to the contribution to the total from areas with low @xmath5 , but very high @xmath6 , and hence high @xmath29 .",
    "thus , there is a significant amount of dense gas in the clumps not engaging in massive star formation , as traced by measures of excitation from ysos .",
    "in addition , we find a very strong correlation between the integrated intensities of hcn and hco@xmath9 , which has previously been shown to be correlated with br@xmath65 emission .",
    "this suggests that even @xmath0 may not be an unbiased tracer of high - density , star - forming gas in the sense required by the kennicutt - schmidt relations .",
    "our results suggest a recalibration of the ks relations may be necessary , implying also a longer gas depletion timescale in galactic star forming regions .",
    "this and future results will be made publicly available for modellers on the champ website , http://www.astro.ufl.edu/champ , providing the fits files of data , derived quantities , and machine readable tables and catalogues .",

    "<S> there is a strong correlation between the hcn integrated intensity , @xmath0 , and previously reported @xmath1 in the clumps , but @xmath2 is not well - correlated with either of these other two `` dense gas tracers '' . </S>",
    "<S> the four fitted parameters from pyspeckit in this region range over @xmath3 = 810 km / s , @xmath4 = 1.22.2 km / s , @xmath5 = 415 k , and @xmath6 = 0.22.5 . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters allow us to derive a column density map of these clouds , without limiting assumptions about the excitation or opacity . a more traditional ( linear ) method of converting @xmath0 to total mass column gives much lower clump masses than our results based on the hyperfine analysis . </S>",
    "<S> this is primarily due to areas in the sample region of low @xmath7 , low @xmath5 , and high @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that there may be more dense gas in these massive clumps not engaged in massive star formation than previously recognized . </S>",
    "<S> if this result holds for other clouds in the champ sample , it would have dramatic consequences for the calibration of the kennicutt - schmidt star formation laws , including a large increase in the gas depletion timescale in such regions .    </S>",
