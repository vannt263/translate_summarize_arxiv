    "quantum wires formed in two - dimensional electron gases are electron waveguides allowing transmission only along one direction . due to the lateral confinement , at typical",
    "electron densities a number of energy subbands may be occupied , which are referred to as transverse modes or channels .",
    "depending on the behavior of the electronic states along the wire they are usually classified in propagating and evanescent .",
    "the latter decay with the distance and , therefore , are irrelevant in the asymptotic regions of the quantum wire , where only propagating modes can exist .",
    "nevertheless , evanescent modes are of paramount importance for a wire with inhomogeneities such as potential barriers or wells.@xcite this is because the evanescent modes strongly influence the scattering conditions determining the reflection and transmission coefficients from a given potential inhomogeneity .",
    "this way , the evanescent modes determine the amplitudes of the propagating modes in the asymptotic regions of a wire with a scattering center .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath0 gives the dependence with the distance @xmath1 along the wire for each specific mode as @xmath2 . while for propagating modes @xmath0 is a real number , for evanescent states it must obviously have an imaginary part . in the most general case @xmath0",
    "may also contain a real part for evanescent modes . when transverse and longitudinal motions are decoupled the wavenumbers for propagating and evanescent modes can be trivially obtained .",
    "indeed , if transverse motion energies are quantized by a set of @xmath0-independent eigenvalues @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , the propagating mode wavenumbers fulfill @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total energy . on the contrary ,",
    "evanescent modes are characterized by @xmath7    the above scenario of eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) with analytically known wavenumbers , purely real and purely imaginary for propagating and evanescent modes , respectively , breaks down when motion along longitudinal and transverse directions are coupled . in this case ,",
    "transverse quantization is not given by a fixed set of eigenvalues @xmath3 but must be solved explicitly for each @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "this makes , in practice , the calculation of evanescent states a formidable task .",
    "the mathematical difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that for general complex @xmath0 s one looses standard properties such as the hermitian condition of the eigenvalue equation , required in most matrix diagonalization algorithms . as a matter of fact ,",
    "given @xmath6 the problem can be mathematically presented as a non - linear eigenvalue equation for @xmath0",
    ". this situation is found , for instance , when a magnetic field is coupled with the electron s orbital motion @xcite or in the specific case addressed in this work , when a spin - orbit coupling is present .",
    "evanescent states with spin - orbit interaction have been recently considered in refs .",
    "and in the context of plane - wave formalisms , adequate for interfaces between flat bottom potentials .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , a general method to obtain the evanescent modes in transmission channels with arbitrary transverse confinements is lacking in the literature .",
    "we stress that the evanescent states do not fulfill proper boundary conditions along the channel since the fact that they vanish in one direction necessarily implies their divergence in the reversed one .",
    "these modes are , therefore , not physically realizable in the entire channel , for @xmath1 spanning the interval @xmath8 . nevertheless , they are extremely important because many physical states do behave as evanescent in restricted domains . this _ unphysical _ condition of the extended evanescent states explains why , mathematically , they are solutions of a non hermitian problem , while physical states always originate from hermitian operators in quantum mechanics .    in this work",
    "we shall discuss a practical algorithm to obtain the evanescent modes when transverse and longitudinal motions are coupled through a spin - orbit term of rashba type,@xcite typical of two - dimensional electron nanostructures . although in the specific applications we shall assume a parabolic transverse potential , the suggested approach will be equally valid for arbitrary transverse confinements .",
    "numerical results for selected values of the rashba coupling strength will be presented as an illustration of the method .",
    "interest in the rashba spin - orbit coupling is mostly due to the tunability of the rashba strength by means of electric gates which opens a possibility of spin control in nanostructures , with the datta and das spin transistor as a well known spintronic device proposal.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the physical system .",

    "v draws the conclusions of the work .",
    "we consider a two dimensional electron gas lying on the @xmath9 plane , with a parabolic confinement in the @xmath10 direction and perfect translational invariance along @xmath1 . the corresponding hamiltonian operator @xmath11 reads @xmath12 additionally , a spin - orbit coupling of rashba type , with coupling strength @xmath13 , is also active @xmath14 the coupling strength @xmath13 is assumed constant throughout the system , including the asymptotic regions in @xmath1 and @xmath10 directions .",
    "the total hamiltonian is thus @xmath15 and we are interested in the solutions of schrdinger s equation for a given energy @xmath6 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is labelling the spin double valued variable .",
    "any energy is physically acceptable since the wire spectrum will be continuous for the propagating modes and , moreover , since we also consider evanescent modes even negative energies will yield solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the spinorial wavefunction is assumed to be separable in the following form @xmath18 it is convenient to express the spin - dependent part in terms of the eigenspinors of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , as @xmath21    equation ( [ eq5 ] ) can be recast as a matrix equation for the amplitudes @xmath22 ,    @xmath23    where we have defined the transverse oscillator operator @xmath24 equation ( [ eq8 ] ) is the central equation we intend to solve in this work .",
    "although it has the formal appearance of a linear eigenvalue equation , with eigenvalue @xmath6 , in our case the energy is given and what is unknown is the wavenumber @xmath0 .",
    "notice also that for complex @xmath0 s the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) in non hermitian , which prevents the use of standard matrix diagonalization routines .",
    "this invalidates the computational strategy normally used for propagating modes and consisting in : a ) preassign a value to @xmath0 ; b ) diagonalize ( [ eq8 ] ) ; c ) find _ a posteriori _",
    "what @xmath0 s give as eigenvalues the energy of interest @xmath6 .",
    "an essential property allowing a strategy to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) is that the amplitudes @xmath22 must fulfill the boundary condition that they vanish for @xmath25 . of course",
    ", @xmath22 must also be smooth functions of @xmath10 , continuous and with continuous derivatives for all @xmath10 s .",
    "these conditions can be fulfilled at the same time _ only _ for some specific wavenumbers representing propagating ( real @xmath0 s ) and evanescent ( complex @xmath0 s ) modes .",
    "our algorithm is based on the use of finite differences , discretizing the @xmath10 axis in @xmath26 uniformly distributed points in the interval @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "the derivatives can then be computed using @xmath28-point formulas , @xcite i.e. , @xmath28 neighboring points are required to compute the derivative at each grid point .",
    "we transform our problem into a linear system of @xmath29 scalar linear equations , yielding the @xmath29 unknowns corresponding to @xmath30 and @xmath31 on the grid .",
    "this linear system has a solution fulfilling the boundary conditions at @xmath32 and @xmath33 for any @xmath0 , real or complex , but only for the physically acceptable wavenumbers both functions have continuous first derivative at an arbitrarily chosen matching point @xmath34 .",
    "since the derivatives may be discontinuous at @xmath34 it is essential in the calculation of the derivatives not to invoke points lying on opposite sides of the matching border .",
    "this is accomplished with the use of non - centered formulas for the derivatives at points near the matching border .     while the rashba strength is chosen as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the oscillator length .",
    "the position of the matching point is given by the dashed line .",
    "upper and lower panels correspond to the indicated wavenumbers.,width=226 ]    at the matching point we do not impose the discretized eq .  ( [ eq8 ] ) but , instead , we ensure a solution different from the trivial one ( vanishing for all @xmath10 s ) by arbitrarily choosing that @xmath37 .",
    "an additional equation is needed to have as many equations as unknowns .",
    "we impose continuity of the first derivative of @xmath31 at @xmath34 . in summary ,",
    "the resulting linear system is given by :    * @xmath38 equations obtained by discretizing ( [ eq8 ] ) for @xmath39 , without crossing the matching border for the derivatives , * @xmath37 , * @xmath40 , where @xmath41 represent @xmath31 derivatives at @xmath34 using noncentered formulas with the left ( @xmath42 ) and right ( @xmath43 ) neighboring points .",
    "the suggested algorithm does not yield normalized transverse amplitudes but , of course , normalization @xmath44 can be trivially imposed after the solution has been obtained .",
    "the matrix representing the linear system is greatly sparse and can be very efficiently solved using standard numerical routines.@xcite the precision of the method increases when using larger @xmath28 s for the derivatives .",
    "we have used up to 11-point formulas but , typically , 5 or 7 points already provide quite accurate results . as an example , fig .",
    "1 shows the amplitudes @xmath22 for two different wavenumbers : upper panel shows a discontinuous first derivative at the matching point , indicating that the chosen @xmath0 is not physically valid ; the situation is different in the lower panel , with perfectly smooth functions .     showing the position of the nodes .",
    "we have used @xmath45 and @xmath35.,width=226 ]    finding the physically acceptable wavenumbers is done by exploring the complex-@xmath0 plane . in practice , we define the real function @xmath46 and look for the zeros of @xmath47 by sweeping @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the real and imaginary parts of the wavenumber , within a preselected range .",
    "figure 2 shows the contour lines of @xmath47 circling the position of the nodes for selected values of @xmath6 and @xmath13 .",
    "having determined the approximate locations , it is then a simple matter to zoom in and accurately determine the nodes .",
    "one must be careful , however , not to miss nodes for which the corresponding minimum is very narrow .",
    "the figure illustrates a symmetry in the @xmath0 plane : if a mode has a certain @xmath0 then wavenumbers obtained by changing sign @xmath50 and/or @xmath51 are also physically valid .",
    "similar conditions were discussed in ref .   for a quantum wire in a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "evanescent modes with wavenumbers having a nonzero real part will therefore come in groups of four , such as the modes in fig .",

    "( [ eq8 ] ) , we find a solution having @xmath57 . on the other hand",
    ", our starting hamiltonian @xmath58 is time reversal invariant which , for a spin 1/2 system , implies that the solutions must appear in degenerate pairs of time reversed states known as kramers doublets . using the time reversal operator for a spin 1/2 system , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 represents complex conjugation",
    ", we find the kramers partner of @xmath56 as @xmath61 . in summary , with both complex conjugation ( cc ) and time reversal symmetry we obtain the fourfold degeneracy @xmath62    it is worth stressing that the degeneracies expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq11n ] ) are valid irrespective of the @xmath10-inversion symmetry of the wire potential .",
    "this is a qualitative difference with the result for wires in perpendicular magnetic field,@xcite where it was found that asymmetric wires display asymmetric @xmath48 branches , i.e. , they do not fulfill the symmetry @xmath63 .",
    "the difference originates from the breaking of time reversal invariance by the external magnetic field .      the mode dispersion for the same wire of the preceding figures is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "we only plot positive wavenumbers noting that , with the above mentioned symmetry , wavenumber signs can be inverted giving a four - fold degeneracy of each evanescent mode and two - fold for the propagating ones .",
    "the dispersion of propagating modes shows a familiar picture , already investigated in detail.@xcite there is a threshold energy @xmath64 for the activation of the @xmath28-th propagating mode . due to the spin - orbit coupling , when @xmath6 slightly exceeds @xmath64 , propagating states with nonzero wavenumber @xmath65 , belonging to the @xmath28-th mode , are allowed .    surprisingly , the evanescent modes in fig .",

    "this is true even for energies much smaller than @xmath64 .",
    "notice that , on the contrary , for evanescent states @xmath49 rapidly increases when @xmath6 decreases , indicating a faster decay of the evanescent mode when the energy separates from the threshold @xmath64 .",
    "strictly speaking , the real part also varies with @xmath6 although it can be hardly noticed to the scale of fig .",

    "nevertheless , it remains true that below the threshold of a propagating mode there is an evanescent mode whose wavenumber initially coincides with @xmath65 , the wavenumber of the propagating mode at threshold .",
    "if the energy is further decreased , @xmath48 does not remain almost constant as in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , but displays a rather strong variation , first decreasing and then increasing again .",
    "it is worth stressing that the symmetry discussed above still applies to fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and one can obtain valid wavenumbers by reverting signs in either @xmath48 or @xmath49",

    "[ fig:4 ] is that @xmath67 , the branches giving @xmath49 , are not monotonously increasing with decreasing energy but display a marked wiggle at @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the simpler behavior of the weak coupling case suggests an analytical expression for the evanescent mode wavenumbers .",
    "we have indeed found that when @xmath72 the evanescent mode wavenumbers can be well approximated by @xmath73 in terms of the threshold energy @xmath74 and wavenumber @xmath75 of the @xmath28-th propagating mode .",

    "actually , the latter patterns are similar to those discussed in ref .   when considering a different physical system ; namely , an interface between a ferromagnet and a semiconductor .",
    "focussing on the evanescent mode side , there is a strong injection of spin @xmath10 magnetization @xmath106 , clearly due to the fact that the incident mode @xmath94 is mostly polarized along @xmath107 ( it is not completely polarized due to the admixture induced by the rashba intersubband coupling term @xmath108 ) .",
    "there is also an important accumulation of evanescent @xmath109 magnetization , of different signs on the two sides of the wire .",

    "the vanishing spin magnetization when adding the contributions from the two left incident channels @xmath94 and @xmath110 can be interpreted , theoretically , as a manifestation of the time reversal symmetry which is conserved by the rashba interaction .",
    "indeed , when @xmath111 is such that there can be no propagation to the right all incident flux is reflected backwards , yielding a solution which is invariant by time reversal .    a remarkable feature in fig .  [ fig:5 ]",
    "is that the density takes its maximum value for @xmath100 , the evanescent mode side .",
    "this is totally unexpected for purely exponentially decaying modes .",
