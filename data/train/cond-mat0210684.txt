    "( [ gs ] ) and threading vortices through the hole of the cylinder .",
    "it should be emphasized here that the above discussion assumed that the three - sublattice structure is respected by the boundary conditions .",
    "while it is clear that the bulk properties do not depend on this , there is an additional quirk when we consider topological degeneracy in a geometry that does not respect the three - sublattice structure .",
    "this is legitimate when all ring exchange couplings are equal .",
    "consider , e.g. , a cylindrical geometry with the circumference along the horizontal direction of figs .  [ lattice ]  and  [ hexlattice ] .",
    "when an a - type particle is transported around the periodic direction , it does not return to its initial position , but rather becomes a b- or c - type particle .",
    "it takes three turns for the particle to return to the original position . from table  [",
    "tab : charges ] , such @xmath98 particle will not register any flux in this process .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that for @xmath99 the ground state of the system in this geometry is nondegenerate . on the other hand , for @xmath100",
    "the ground state is found to be three - fold degenerate , since in this case there is a composite object that returns to its initial state when transported once around the cylinder and that senses some flux through the hole of the cylinder in the process .",
    "returning to our microscopic bosonic model , the `` particle description '' of the @xmath39 phase is as follows : we have two species of @xmath0 vortices ( with gap @xmath101 ) and we have charged particles ( with charge gap @xmath102 ) that can be classified as carrying two distinct @xmath0 gauge charges , in addition to their fractional electrical charge .",
    "finally , note that the @xmath39 state is associated with the additional symmetries in the hexagonal lattice ring exchange hamiltonian but is protected by the same charge gap projection , since any move within the uncharged state sector is necessarily a combination of hexagon ring exchanges .",
    "we showed that it is possible to produce more complicated fractionalization patterns such as @xmath0 fractionalization in relatively simple bosonic models . while the resulting fractionalized state turned out to be even more complicated than initially intended , the microscopic model was not too contrived .",
    "it is hoped that this work will encourage further searches for other exotic states .",
