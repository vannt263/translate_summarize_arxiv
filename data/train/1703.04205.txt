    "the nonlocal extension of general relativity ( gr ) has been realized via gr@xmath0 , the teleparallel equivalent of gr .",
    "gr@xmath0 is the gauge theory of the abelian group of spacetime translations .",
    "the formal analogy between gr@xmath0 and electrodynamics originally led friedrich w. hehl to suggest that a nonlocal gr@xmath0 could be developed in analogy with nonlocal electrodynamics .",
    "friedrich s idea has been constructive : the nonlocal part of the resulting nonlocal gravity theory may provide a natural explanation for  dark matter \"  @xcite . _ we dedicate this paper to friedrich on the occasion of his eightieth birthday . _    nonlocal gravity is a tetrad theory ; that is , the gravitational potentials in nonlocal general relativity are given by the fundamental tetrad frame field @xmath1 from which one obtains the spacetime metric via orthonormality , namely , @xmath2 .",

    "we use units such that @xmath10 , unless specified otherwise .",
    "the indices are raised and lowered by means of the metric tensors @xmath11 and @xmath4 ; furthermore , in order to change a holonomic index of a tensor into an anholonomic index or vice versa , we project the tensor on the fundamental tetrad field . the spacetime metric is compatible with the levi - civita connection as well as the weitzenbck connection.the fundamental tetrad frame field is globally teleparallel via the weitzenbck connection , which is curvature - free .",
    "thus two distant vectors are considered parallel in nonlocal gravity if they have the same components with respect to their local fundamental tetrad frames .",
    "the curvature of the levi - civita connection and the torsion of the weitzenbck connection are related and constitute complementary aspects of the gravitational field in nonlocal gravity .",

    "@xcite and the references cited therein . using the electromagnetic analogy , nonlocal gravity has been obtained from gr@xmath0 by rendering it nonlocal by means of a  constitutive \" kernel .",
    "that is , the nonlocality is due to a causal constitutive kernel that is introduced into the theory in close analogy with the nonlocal electrodynamics of media .",
    "the kernel acts as the weight function for a certain average of the gravitational field over spacetime ; indeed , in the absence of this nonocal contribution to the gravitational field equations , the theory reduces to einstein s general relativity .",
    "nonlocal gravity is thus history dependent and gravitational memory must therefore be taken into account .",

    "it turns out that this simple spacetime memory of past events that is reflected in the nonlocal aspect of gravity simulates dark matter .",
    "that is , there is no dark matter in nonlocal gravity ; instead , what appears as dark matter in astrophysics and cosmology is expected to be due to the nonlocal character of the gravitational interaction .",
    "other than the trivial solution indicating the absence of a gravitational field in minkowski spacetime , no exact solution of the field equation of nonlocal gravity is known at present ; therefore , we must resort to the general linear approximation and its newtonian limit  @xcite . to explore some of the cosmological implications of nonlocal gravity",
    ", we have extended nonlocal gravity in the newtonian regime to the cosmological domain  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have assumed that nonlocal newtonian cosmology is related to nonlocal gravity theory in much the same way as newtonian cosmology is related to the standard homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models of gr  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite and discuss further some of the consequences of our cosmological model . in particular , we study the formation of spherically symmetric structures within the framework of nonlocal newtonian cosmology .",

    "further comparison with observational data is expected to determine which reciprocal kernel is in better agreement with experiment . in this connection , we should mention that at this stage of development of nonlocal gravity , the possibility that more complicated kernels may be required involving other parameters can not be excluded .    at the present epoch @xmath24",

    "@xmath26 is the short - range parameter that remains to be determined , while @xmath30 kpc and @xmath31 kpc are galactic lengths that have been tentatively determined from the rotation curves of nearby spiral galaxies and the internal dynamics of nearby clusters of galaxies .",

    "further details about the force law are contained in section v. we expect that the gravitational physics of the solar system is affected by nonlocal gravity ; indeed , using current solar - system data regarding the perihelion precession of saturn , a preliminary lower limit of order @xmath46 cm has been placed on @xmath26 , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    how can the functional form of @xmath18 during past cosmological epochs be determined ? in the absence of exact cosmological models",
    "@xcite , nonlocal newtonian cosmology has been developed in close analogy with newtonian cosmology  @xcite .",
    "that is , as in newtonian cosmology  @xcite , we assume that after recombination nonlocal gravity is adequate for the description of the nonrelativistic motion of matter on subhorizon scales . in principle , the parameters of the reciprocal kernel @xmath18 could change with cosmic time ; then , we would have @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , such that @xmath50 , etc .",
    "we note , based on inspection of eqs .",
    " , that @xmath47 and @xmath51 would determine the shape of the kernel over short and long distances , respectively , while @xmath48 would determine its overall strength . following recombination ,",
    "once clumps of matter start to separate from the expanding background , they are expected to undergo internal gravitational collapse and eventually contribute to the formation of galaxies that are then very weakly affected by the gravitational tidal forces of the background expanding universe  @xcite .",
    "we therefore tentatively assume for the sake of simplicity that @xmath52 and @xmath53 , since these parameters primarily affect the internal structure of self - gravitating galactic systems . on the other hand , the tohline ",
    "kuhn parameter @xmath48 determines the overall strength of the reciprocal kernel and this could be time - dependent .",
    "thus the main new idea is that the fading of memory in time implies that the nonlocal aspect of gravity must have been stronger in the past cosmological epochs ; that is , the net strength of the gravitational interaction must decrease with cosmic time , since the _ effective amount of dark matter _ decreases as the universe expands .",
    "to implement this idea , we assume that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 monotonically increases with cosmic time and @xmath56 .",

    "this general circumstance leads to the problem of missing baryons in the standard model of cosmology  @xcite .",
    "of course , the same problem of missing baryons could possibly exist in nonlocal gravity theory as well .",
    "we emphasize that the nonlocal cosmological model under consideration here is a toy model .",
