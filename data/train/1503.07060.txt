    "since the equations of the system are to be satisfied for arbitrary values of spin , we obtain the system of six equations for six unknowns @xmath166 .    first , there are three equations for three unknowns @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , at given @xmath0 : @xmath167 these equations describe the parameters of isco for the spinless case .",
    "solution of the first two equations in this system gives us the values of @xmath155 and @xmath156 for an arbitrary circular orbit of given inverse radius , see ( [ xe ] ) .",
    "solving three equations simultaneously , we can obtain the equation for @xmath157 , see ( [ u-0 ] ) .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ u-0 ] ) for @xmath157 has a complicated form .",
    "therefore it is more convenient to express the six unknowns not as explicit functions of @xmath0 but as the explicit functions of @xmath0 and @xmath157 , keeping in mind that @xmath157 can be found from eq.([u-0 ] ) at arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "before we proceed we need to notice that representation of all unknowns via @xmath157 given below could be rewritten in a different form using ( [ u-0 ] ) .    to get @xmath155 and @xmath156 for isco we can substitute @xmath168 into the expressions for an arbitrary circular orbit ( [ xe ] ) .",
    "but it is more convenient to obtain directly the connections between parameters @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 for isco from three equations ( [ system - null ] ) .",
    "it is easy to obtain that : @xmath169 whereas @xmath156 has positive value and we can write @xmath170 the value of @xmath155 can have both signs . from expression for @xmath155 in ( [ xe ] ) , we see that the second term in numerator is always bigger ( or equal ) than the first term , which means that the sign of @xmath155 is determined by sign in front of the second term in numerator .",
    "therefore @xmath171 stands for co - rotating orbits and @xmath172 for counter - rotating orbits .",
    "we can write : @xmath173 for @xmath156 we can also write : @xmath174    three equations for small - spin corrections @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , partially simplified with using the third equation in ( [ system - null ] ) and relation @xmath175 , are : @xmath176    after significant simplifications with using expressions ( [ x0e0viau0 ] ) , ( [ x0viau0 ] ) , ( [ e0viau02 ] ) we succeed to obtain the corrections in a simple form : @xmath177 to avoid singularity in the schwarzschild case ( @xmath11 , @xmath178 ) , we can also rewrite ( [ lineinye - popravki ] ) as @xmath179    let us summarise the results of this section . to obtain isco parameters for given @xmath0 in the form ( [ podstanovka ] ) one should find @xmath157 from equation @xmath180 and then calculate @xmath155 with using ( [ x0viau0 ] ) , @xmath156 with using ( [ e0viau01 ] ) , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 with using ( [ lineinye - popravki ] ) or ( [ lineinye - popravki - schw ] ) .",
    "the value @xmath131 can be found by using @xmath181 : @xmath182 the isco radius @xmath63 can be found by using @xmath183 : @xmath184    we calculate also the isco frequency for arbitrary value of @xmath0 , as described at the end of section [ section - epspin ] .",
    "using ( [ x0viau0 ] ) , ( [ e0viau02 ] ) and ( [ lineinye - popravki ] ) in ( [ omega - definition ] ) we obtain @xmath185 as @xmath186 @xmath187 or , in terms of @xmath188 as @xmath189    in all the formulae the upper sign corresponds to the antiparallel orientation of particle s angular momentum @xmath190 and bh spin @xmath191 ( counter - rotation , @xmath192 ) , the lower  to the parallel one ( corotation , @xmath193 ) ; @xmath1 is the projection of spin on the @xmath44-axis and can be positive ( spins of particle and bh are parallel ) or negative ( antiparallel ) ; @xmath0 is positive or equal to zero ; the @xmath44-axis is chosen to be parallel to bh spin @xmath191 .",
    "in order to illustrate the obtained results , let us consider some important limit cases : schwarzschild metric and kerr metric , when the bh rotation is slow ( @xmath14 ) and extremely fast ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "the latter case is called `` extreme kerr bh '' , for at the values of @xmath0 exceeding @xmath10 the bh disappears and we have a naked singularity @xcite without an event horizon .    in the schwarzschild case there is no prefential direction associated with bh spin ( @xmath11 ) , so @xmath44-direction can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "choosing @xmath44-axis along @xmath190 vector , and taking @xmath195 , we obtain : @xmath196 here instead of @xmath1 , which is the projection on @xmath44-axis that does not unabiguously correspond to any physical direction in schwarzschild case , we use @xmath197 which is the projection of particle s spin upon the direction of @xmath190 and is positive when the particle s spin is parallel to it and negative when it is antiparallel .",
    "value @xmath131 is considered as positive in this case .",
    "small - spin corrections for schwarzschild metric were derived by favata @xcite .",
    "the case of slowly rotating kerr bh ( @xmath14 ) allows us to separate corrections that arise from different types of angular momentum coupling .",
    "our general formulae , presented in section [ section - arbitrary ] , allow us to obtain correction terms proportional to @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath198 . considering @xmath14 in equation ( [ eq - u0 ] ) , we get @xmath157 : @xmath199 using the first two terms from ( [ u0-slow - kerr ] ) in ( [ e0viau01 ] ) , ( [ x0viau0 ] ) , ( [ lineinye - popravki - schw ] ) , we obtain @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "note that when using formulae ( [ lineinye - popravki ] ) for calculation of corrections @xmath159 and @xmath160 , the quadratic terms from ( [ u0-slow - kerr ] ) should be also taken into account .",
    "corrections @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath198 for isco parameters can be as well obtained directly by solving the system ( [ p ] ) , with keeping terms linear in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "if we do nt assume any ratio between values @xmath0 and @xmath1 , a full description of the problem requires also to obtain quadratic terms @xmath200 and @xmath201 in isco parameters .",
    "the scheme for obtaining the squared corrections is analogous to the linearisation procedure , only we need to express the parameters in the form @xmath202 and retain the squared in spin terms in the system ( [ p ] ) .    for our purposes we can use more simple way : corrections @xmath200 can be found from solution of the system ( [ p ] ) for schwarzschild case , and @xmath201-corrections can be found from consideration of the spinless case .",
    "finally , we obtain : @xmath203 different situations of mutual orientation of bh and particle spin are presented on figure [ figure - im2 ] , where the case @xmath14 is drawn on the basis of the first three terms in formula ( [ kerr - slow ] ) for @xmath204 .",
    "for example , for particle @xmath205 we should use the upper sign and @xmath107 , for particle @xmath206 we should use the lower sign and @xmath108 .",
    "this result allows to understand the character of the spin - orbital coupling in gr . from the terms @xmath207 and @xmath208 , we see that the the spin - orbital coupling depends on mutual orientation of the spin and angular momentum vectors : it is attractive and the radius decreases , when they are parallel , and repulsive , if they are antiparallel .    the terms with @xmath198 , @xmath201 , @xmath200 in formulae ( [ kerr - slow ] ) are of second infinitesimal order and include information about interactions of particle spin , bh spin and orbital momentum . considering the formula for radius it is easy to show that the trinomial containing these three terms is negative for all possible values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , quadratic corrections always lead to decrease of the isco radius .    substituting values of @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath204 from ( [ kerr - slow ] ) into ( [ omega - definition ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the isco frequency as @xmath211",
    "in the extreme kerr background ( @xmath194 ) for a spinless particle the isco radius is @xmath9 in the antiparallel case ( counter - rotation ) , and @xmath10 in the parallel case ( co - rotation ) .",
    "numerical solution of the system ( [ p ] ) for @xmath0 close to @xmath10 shows that isco radius has very different behaviour for co - rotating ( @xmath193 ) and counter - rotating ( @xmath192 ) particles , see fig .",
    "[ figure - ekerr - co ] and [ figure - ekerr - rr ] .",
    "we will therefore consider these cases separately .    in the antiparallel case",
    "we get , using ( [ e0viau01 ] ) , ( [ x0viau0 ] ) , ( [ lineinye - popravki ] ) , ( [ omega - arbitrary - a ] ) : @xmath212    for the parallel case we search for isco parameters at values of @xmath13 , @xmath213 , because divergences may appear at @xmath214 at some ways of calculations . using ( [ e0viau01 ] ) , ( [ x0viau0 ] ) , ( [ lineinye - popravki ] ) , ( [ omega - arbitrary - a ] )",
    ", we get : @xmath215 we see that in the case of @xmath12 ( @xmath216 ) the corrections , linear in spin , are absent in formulae for isco radius and frequency .",
    "this was also demonstrated in @xcite . in the next section",
    "we discuss this feature in details and find the exact in spin expressions for the isco parameters .",
    "the radius of horizon of the kerr bh , @xmath217 in the case @xmath218 will have the form @xcite @xmath219 as @xmath220 and @xmath221 for @xmath213 , it will always be that @xmath222 .",
    "in the work @xcite on basis of the numerical calculation , it was noticed that in the extreme kerr background for the parallel case the magnitude of test - body s spin does not influence the radius of the last stable orbit and it always remains equal to @xmath10 . solving numerically eqs ( [ p ] ) , we plot fig . [ figure - ekerr - co ] where this conclusion is distinctly visible .",
    "we also succeeded in proving this analytically .    on basis of results of the numerical solution",
    "we have substituted @xmath223 into the system ( [ p ] ) and have obtained the expressions for @xmath89 and @xmath27 , which is the analytical proof of existence of such solution of the system .",
    "the exact solution is then @xmath224 using ( [ kerr - exact ] ) in ( [ omega - definition ] ) , we obtain the isco frequency as @xmath225    developing ( [ kerr - exact ] ) in series in @xmath1 , we get the linear in spin terms which are in agreement with ( [ kerr - co ] ) at @xmath216 .",
    "this result allows us to obtain the full in spin correction to the nearly extreme black hole , with @xmath218 , considered in the section [ section - extreme - kerr ] . for this purpose after substituting this value for @xmath0 we develop the system ( [ p ] ) in series in @xmath226 and seek for the solution in the form @xmath227 , where @xmath228 stands for @xmath229 .",
    "after some algebraic calculation we obtain for the nearly extreme kerr metric the expressions :    @xmath230    developing this result in series in @xmath1 , one obtains all terms in expressions ( [ kerr - co ] ) .",
    "note that derivation of mpd equations was performed under condition @xmath220 , so always we have @xmath231 , @xmath232 in ( [ kerr - exact ] ) and ( [ kerr - delta ] ) .",
    "indeed , equations of motion of a spinning particle were derived under the assumption that its characteristic size is very small compared with the characteristic length of the background field ( e.g. the distance from the central body ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "mller @xcite had shown in the context of special relativity that the classical spinning body must have a certain minimum characteristic size connected with its specific spin , see also wald @xcite . for particle at isco , in our system of units",
    "the above conditions reduce to @xmath220 , see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in previous parts of the present paper we have discussed isco , and investigated how the presence of spin influences parameters of isco for different given @xmath0 .",
    "let us now discuss not innermost stable but arbitrary circular orbits .",
    "we will investigate how the presence of spin influences orbit of given radius ",
    "namely , how @xmath27 , @xmath131 , @xmath185 of a circular orbit of given radius are changed if a test particle has spin .",
    "let us suppose that inverse radius @xmath77 of circular orbit is known and consider the system ( [ n ] ) .",
    "we shall seek for its solution in the form @xmath233 here @xmath155 and @xmath156 are the values of @xmath89 and @xmath27 in the `` spinless '' case , see ( [ xe ] ) , @xmath158 and @xmath159 are the linear corrections associated with spin .",
    "we obtain for the linear corrections :    @xmath234    these expressions are valid for both stable and unstable circular orbits with the zero order isco parameters given by ( [ xe ] ) .",
    "value of total angular momentum @xmath235 can be obtained using @xmath181 .",
