    "recently , granular systems are intensively studied using methods of statistical physics .",
    "the main motivation of this research is to get basic understanding of these technologically important materials whose behaviour , however , very often appears elusive and mysterious  @xcite .",
    "one of the classical experiments in this field concerns the spatial separation of shaken sand  @xcite . in this experiment one uses a box which is divided into two equal compartments by a wall which has a narrow horizontal slit at a certain height .",
    "when the box is filled with a sand and shaken one observes that under certain conditions ( e.g. , frequency and amplitude of shaking ) one compartment of a box is preferentially filled with sand .",
    "theoretical arguments to understand how the symmetry breaking arises in this experiment , were given by eggers  @xcite . in his approach",
    ", eggers studied a continuous model based on partial differential equations which takes into account certain particular characteristics of shaken granular systems  @xcite .",
    "namely the fact that effective temperature of a granular system decreases when the density of particles increases .",
    "this at first counterintuitive feature of granular systems is now understood as a result of inelastic collisions between particles which effectively cool the system  @xcite .",
    "this feature is also responsible for the symmetry breaking in the experiment with shaken sand .",
    "indeed , with nonequal distribution of sand the temperature in the compartment with majority of particles is substantially reduced .",
    "consequently , particles from this compartment are less likely to cross the slit .",
    "eggers has shown that a continuous phase transition accompanies the symmetry breaking .",
    "the approach used by eggers was generalized for a larger number of compartments separating the box .",
    "it was shown that in such a case the phase transition becomes discontinuous  @xcite .",
    "eggers s model is however quite complicated and its analysis must be supplemented with some simplifying assumptions .",
    "the analysis of fluctuations or dynamical properties seems to be particularly difficult for this model .",
    "a possible alternative might be to examine a different , presumably simpler model , which would nevertheless grasp the essence of the phenomena .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to define and analyze such a model .",
    "our model is a certain generalization of the urn model introduced by ehrenfest  @xcite . in ehrenfest model one has balls which are distributed between two urns and certain dynamical rules according to which balls can change their location .",
    "ehrenfest model greatly contributed to the understanding of some basic notions of statistical mechanics like the equilibrium or approach to the equilibrium .",
    "various modifications of this model were examined  @xcite .    at first sight",
    "it seems natural that ehrenfest model could provide an approximate description of experiments with shaken sand .",
    "however , none of its generalizations described in the literature exhibits a spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the modification which we propose does exhibit a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "although the model is rather simple it exhibits a rich behaviour .",
    "in addition to having a line of continuous transitions , the model has a tricritical point and a line of discontinuous transitions .",
    "the discontinuous transitions are screened by very strong metastability .",
    "existence of this , unobservable in fact ( due to metastability ) transition in our dynamical model requires , however , some comments . in equilibrium systems it is the free energy which unambiguously determines the phase which is stable for a given set of parameters . for our dynamical model",
    "we do not know how to calculate the free energy .",
    "nevertheless , certain features enabled us to locate the discontinuous transitions in our model .",
    "namely probability distribution of the order parameter exhibits characteristics which are typical to equilibrium systems with discontinuous transitions",
    ". additional evidence of such a transition in our model comes form the analysis of characteristic times , which we determine solving numerically the first - passage problem .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model and examine its steady - state properties . in section iii , from the solution of the master equation we analyze the steady - state probability distribution and fluctuations in the model .",
    "section iv is devoted to the metastable properties and characteristic times obtained from the solution of the first - passage problem .",
    "conclusions and possible extensions of our work are discussed in section v.",
    "our model is defined as follows : @xmath1 particles are distributed between two urns a and b and the number of particles in each urn is denoted as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "particles in a given urn are subject to thermal fluctuations and the temperature @xmath8 of the urn depends on the number of particles in it . to mimic the effect that a larger number of particles leads to a smaller temperature",
    ", we use the following rule : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a fraction of a total number of particles in a given urn and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive constants .",
    "with such a choice , temperatures of urns changes linearly with @xmath13 from the value @xmath11 to @xmath14 . for granular systems",
    "the relation between temperature and the number of particles is very complicated and depends on certain parameters like density of particles or the type of driving  @xcite . for the experiment with separation of sand",
    "certain arguments suggest that @xmath15 would be more suitable  @xcite . however , with such a choice the location of the critical point changes with @xmath1 . as expected on general grounds , the observed behaviour for finite @xmath1 is only a crossover and a well - defined phase transition exists only in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "our choice ( [ temp ] ) , leads to results which are well - defined in the thermodynamic limit @xmath16 .",
    "however , it would be interesting to examine other choices too .",
    "next , we assume that particles within a given urn obey the standard maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "it means that their distribution changes with the height @xmath17 ( above the bottom of an urn ) as @xmath18 , \\label{height}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the mass of a particle and @xmath20 is the earth acceleration .",
    "one can easily calculate that the fraction of particles obeying distribution ( [ height ] ) , which are above a certain height @xmath21 is given as @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "next , we define dynamics of our model as follows : + ( i ) one of the @xmath1 particles is selected randomly . + ( ii ) with probability @xmath22 $ ] the selected particle changes urns .",

    "it turns out , however , that in a certain region of phase diagram both symmetric and asymmetric solutions are stable ( see fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "it suggests that in that region a line of discontinuous transition should exist .",
    "this line would meet a critical line at a certain point which , by analogy with equilibrium systems  @xcite , can be called a tricritical point .",
    "location of this point can be easily determined from eq .",
    "( [ flux1 ] ) . indeed , requiring that the third order ( in @xmath24 ) coefficients are the same  @xcite and taking in account eq .",
    "( [ critical ] ) , we obtain the the tricritical point is located at @xmath35 .",
    "however , it is by no means obvious how to determine the line of discontinuous transitions in our model . in equilibrium systems",

    "for our urn model one can write evolution equations for the probability distribution @xmath36 that in a given urn ( say a ) at the time @xmath37 there are @xmath38 particles .",

    "the above equation are equivalent to the ones of the ehrenfest model  @xcite .",
    "supplementing the above equations with initial conditions one can solve them numerically  @xcite .",
    "examples of such solutions in a long - time limit are shown in fig .",
    "[ config ] .",
    "as expected , one finds a single- and double - peak distribution in regions i and ii , respectively .",
    "the width of these peaks decreases with the number of particles @xmath1 .",
    "the behaviour of the probability distribution in regions iii and iv is however more complicated .",
    "although for small @xmath1 it has three - peak structure , the shape changes in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "the final distribution depends whether the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath11 are in region iii or iv . in region",
    "iii , for increasing @xmath1 , the central peak diminishes and in the limit @xmath42 we obtain a two - peak distribution . on the other hand , in region",
    "iv only the central peak survives in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "as we will show , a line which separates these two regions can be interpreted as a line of discontinuous transitions .",
    "before we approximately locate this line , let us study fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "since we know the probability distribution , these fluctuations can be calculated numerically , without making additional assumptions  @xcite .",
    "using the variance of the order parameter we define the susceptibility @xmath43 as : @xmath44 ^ 2\\ } , \\label{susc}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 denotes the steady - state probabilities obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ evol1 ] ) .",
    "susceptibility is known to diverge at the continuous phase transition .",
    "our calculations for @xmath46 confirm such a behaviour ( fig .",
    "[ susc ] ) for @xmath47 the inverse susceptibility @xmath48 decays linearly which implies @xmath49 ( mean - field value ) . for @xmath50 ( asymmetric phase )",
    "the behaviour is less clear but we also expect a linear decay of @xmath48 .    to check our steady - state and master - equation calculations we performed monte carlo simulations which are also presented in some cases .",
    "the implementation of this method for the present model is rather straightforward .",
    "let us notice that the behaviour of the probability distribution as seen in fig .",
    "[ config ] bears some similarity to equilibrium systems .",
    "in particular , it is known that the simultaneous existence of peaks of both phases is an indicator of the first - order phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "although our model is defined only using dynamical rules and thus has no free energy ( at least as defined for equilibrium systems ) it does exhibit some other features typical to equilibrium systems . to precisely locate the transition point we calculated the scaled susceptibility @xmath51 .",
    "we expect that when only a single peak survives @xmath51 vanishes , while it remains positive in the double - peak region . for @xmath52 the obtained results ( fig",
    ".  [ location ] ) locate the transition around @xmath53 . as we will see in the next section",
    "there is also a dynamical indicator of this transition .",
    "analysis of the probability distribution for our dynamical model which was done in the previous section shows some similarity to equilibrium discontinuous transitions . it is known that such transitions are usually accompanied by metastability . in the present section",
    "we examine such effects in our model .",
    "the most transparent indication of metastability is hysteresis . that our model exhibits such a behaviour is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ hister ] .",
    "one can see , that upon increasing @xmath12 , the system prepared in the asymmetric state remains in this state up to @xmath54 which is close to the limits of stability of this state ( see fig .  [ diagram ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath12 decreases the symmetric state persists up to @xmath55 which is again close to the limits of stability of symmetric phase .",
    "simulations show that the range of the hysteresis only slightly depends on the system size and the simulation time .",
    "for large system sizes the model will persist in the initial state until the limits of stability of this state are reached , as calculated from the steady - state equation ( [ flux1 ] ) .",
    "such a behaviour indicates a very strong metastability . as we will show below , in regions iii and iv of the phase diagram certain characteristic times diverge exponentially with the system size which corresponds to the broken ergodicity ( i.e. , dynamical phase space of the model is decomposed into disconnected sectors ) .",
    "let us notice that in ( short - ranged ) equilibrium systems metastability has always a finite lifetime and longer simulations or larger system size shrink the hysteresis .    to examine the metastable properties of our model",
    "further we will calculate certain characteristic times .",
    "it is known that for urn models some of these quantities can be calculated as the so - called first - passage problem .",
    "we will use a similar approach . more specifically ,",
    "let us consider a configuration where there are @xmath38 and @xmath56 balls in urn a and b , respectively ( @xmath1-even ) .",
    "now , we define an average time @xmath57 needed for such a configuration to reach a symmetric configuration ( @xmath58 ) . from the dynamical rules of our model",
    "one finds that @xmath57 s obey the following @xmath59 linear equations ( to simplify notation we omit the second argument in @xmath60 s ) : @xmath61+[1-\\omega(n)][\\tau(n)+1]\\nonumber\\\\ \\tau(n-1)=&&\\frac{n-1}{n}\\omega(n-1)[\\tau(n-2)+1]+\\frac{1}{n}\\omega(1)[\\tau(n)+1 ] + [ 1-\\frac{n-1}{n}\\omega(n-1)-\\frac{1}{n}\\omega(1)][\\tau(n-1)+1]\\nonumber\\\\ \\vdots\\nonumber\\\\ \\tau(m)=&&\\frac{m}{n}\\omega(m)[\\tau(m-1)+1]+\\frac{n - m}{n}\\omega(n - m)[\\tau(m+1)+1]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + [ 1-\\frac{m}{n}\\omega(m)-\\frac{n - m}{n}\\omega(n - m)][\\tau(m+1)+1]\\nonumber\\\\ \\vdots\\nonumber\\\\ \\tau(0.5n+1)=&&(0.5+\\frac{1}{n})\\omega(0.5n+1)+ ( 0.5-\\frac{1}{n})\\omega(0.5n-1)[\\tau(0.5n+2)+1]+\\nonumber\\\\ & & [ 1-(0.5+\\frac{1}{n})\\omega(0.5n+1)-(0.5-\\frac{1}{n})\\omega(0.5n-1 ) ] [ \\tau(0.5n+1)+1 ] \\label{taurec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similar equations can be written for the ehrenfest model  @xcite .",
    "we were unable to write an explicit solution of the above set of equations .",
    "however , its tridiagonal structure greatly simplifies its numerical solution .",
    "in particular the so - called gaussian elimination can be used to calculate @xmath60 s recursively  @xcite . since",
