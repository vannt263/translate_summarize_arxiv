    "if one is interested in a discrete approximation of , one faces the problem that the operator acting on @xmath2 is the sum of a multiplication operator and a kernel operator ; and the former is never compact ( apart from trivial cases ) .",
    "therefore , a direct application of most standard methods of approximation theory fails because , for these , compactness is a prerequisite . in this article , it will be shown that , under some moderate extra conditions , these methods can nevertheless be applied .",
    "one motivation to study equations of the form is their occurrence in population genetics , which is concerned with the ( micro)evolution of the genetic composition of populations . for many situations ,",
    "individuals are adequately described by a continuous scalar variable , representing , for example , a quantitative character under selection .",
    "this leads to the definition of so - called continuum - of - alleles ( coa ) models , in which individuals are identified with this variable , referred to as their type .",
    "usually , selection is then modeled by type - dependent fitness values , whereas mutation is described , for every source type , by a probability distribution for the mutant types .",
    "for a recent review of and relevant literature on coa models , see @xcite .    in population genetics , evolution",
    "may quite generally be assumed to proceed in continuous time , with overlapping generations , or in discrete generations .",
    "for the coa model , in both cases , equilibrium is described by an equation of the form , compare @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath3 is the set of possible types . assuming the population to be effectively infinite , we represent it by the probability density @xmath2 .    the notation chosen here",
    "best fits the case of continuous time , where @xmath10 describes the effective reproduction rate of type @xmath11 ( i.e.ifnextchar , , the difference of its birth and death rate ) , the so - called malthusian fitness , and @xmath12 is the mutation rate @xmath13 of type @xmath14 times the density @xmath15 of mutant types @xmath11 , conditioned on a mutation to occur for @xmath14 . with discrete generations , @xmath10 has the interpretation of the expected number of offspring of an individual of type @xmath11 , i.e.ifnextchar , , its wrightian fitness , and mutation is assumed to occur during reproduction with some probability @xmath16 for type @xmath14 .",
    "the distribution of mutant types is again given by @xmath15 , hence @xmath17 . in both cases",
    ", @xmath9 equals the equilibrium mean fitness @xmath18 .",
    "there are several reasons why it is desirable to approximate a coa model by a model with discrete types .",
    "one reason is the need for numerical investigations of coa models , since most of them are not tractable analytically .",
    "these inevitably require a discrete formulation of the model .",
    "another reason is that recently a simple characterization of the equilibrium of discrete mutation ",
    "selection models has been found @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ; this takes the form of a scalar maximum principle in a limit of infinitely many types that densely fill a compact interval .",
    "gaining a better understanding of the relation between models with discrete and continuous types is therefore promising to enable a transfer of some of these results .",
    "this article starts with a summary of brger s results on in section  , since these form the basis for our treatment .",
    "we will then consider two methods to approximate compact kernel operators and extend them to our case .",
    "one , the nystrm method , is applicable to continuous functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 on compact intervals @xmath3 and involves sampling of these functions .",
    "this is presented in section  .",
    "the other one , the galerkin method , is based on projections to finite - dimensional subspaces and works  in principle  for a broad class of compact operators . in our case , however , one has to make relatively strong assumptions , e.g.ifnextchar , , that the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , in some sense , uniformly continuous .",
    "then , it turns out that the local averaging in the projection process can be replaced by sampling again ( if an additional condition is satisfied ) .",
    "this is discussed in section  .",
    "a comparison of both methods in section   and an outlook in section   complete this article .",
    "[ sec : operatornot ]    let us first put the equilibrium condition in operator notation . since we are interested in probability densities , we will consider @xmath0 , or a subspace thereof , as the underlying function space .",
    "we define the total mutation rate of type @xmath11 as @xmath21 and , for notational brevity , @xmath22 then , is equivalent to the eigenvalue equation @xmath23 where , for elements @xmath24 of the function space and all @xmath25 , @xmath26 as mentioned above , being a ( non - zero ) multiplication operator , @xmath27 can not be compact ( compare ( * ? ? ? * thm .",
