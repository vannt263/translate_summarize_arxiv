    "within landau theory , phases of matter are identified by their local order parameters , and transitions taking place between different phases are successfully understood by analyzing how order parameters change on crossing the transition points . in this framework , local quantities ( including two - point correlation functions ) fully characterize the phase .",
    "nonetheless , phases that can not be detected through local quantities do exist .",
    "they are usually referred to as topological phases , both protected and non - protected by symmetries  @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of non - local order in one dimension is probably the string order ( so ) , first discussed in the context of the haldane phase  @xcite , which characterizes the ground state of integer - spin heisenberg chains .",
    "so accounts for correlations between spins that are not detected by a simple two - point correlation function  @xcite , and reveals the presence of a hidden order parameter , that is related to a non - local symmetry of the hamiltonian  @xcite .    whereas the resilience of so to local static perturbations has been thoroughly characterized  @xcite , much less is known on its robustness to dynamical perturbations .",
    "building on the results reported in an earlier work  @xcite , in this paper we continue the characterization of the time evolution of so in a specific dynamical protocol : a quantum quench  @xcite . here",
    ", an initially - prepared many - body state evolves under the action of a time - independent hamiltonian .",
    "when the quenched hamiltonian is extensive , as it is in the case considered in this work , one refers to a global quench .",
    "the key result upon which this paper is built is the following : so can be abruptly destroyed after an infinitesimal amount of time .",
    "we call this phenomenon _ string - order melting _  @xcite .",
    "this is in stark contrast with landau local order , e.g. the magnetization of a spin lattice , where the order parameter of the system can not disappear instantaneously , but only after a finite amount of time , because of continuity of its time evolution .",
    "the goal of this paper is to elucidate the nature of this peculiar situation with numerical simulations and analytical discussions of specific limits .    a number of theoretical works dealt with the problem of studying the dynamics in topological systems after a quantum quench  @xcite . a general analysis of the behavior of all the indicators of a symmetry - protected topological phase in the presence of a quantum quench is still lacking . to the best of our knowledge , the sudden disappearance of so , one of the mentioned indicators , has not been observed yet , neither theoretically nor experimentally .",
    "our result opens the intriguing perspective that symmetry - protected topological phases might disappear abruptly in the presence of a time - dependent perturbation .",
    "this should be the object of further investigations .    in this paper , we focus on the dynamics of so in a spin-1 chain after a global quantum quench .",
    "we consider the protocol already introduced in ref .",
    "initially , the system is prepared in the ground state of the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) hamiltonian  @xcite , known as aklt state , which is the simplest example of a state in the haldane phase , featuring its typical properties .",
    "the persistence of so after the quench is related to the symmetries of the hamiltonian ruling the time evolution  @xcite .",
    "the case in which the symmetries allow the presence of so at finite times has been characterized in ref .",

    ", we focus on cases in which the symmetries of the quenched hamiltonian are such that so is either preserved or suddenly destroyed after the global quantum quench , and characterize this situation in detail .",
    "our numerical results are based on simulations using matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite .",
    "a rich phenomenology can be observed at different length scales .",
    "we observe the clear presence of a short - length region , roughly identified as the thermalization region , where correlations induced by the quench have propagated , and of a long - length region , where the physics of melting is occurring .",
    "we corroborate these results with a simple analytical model which explicitly illustrates the mechanism of so melting .",
    "properly tuned symmetry properties simplify the analytic description , thus allowing a quantitative description of the dynamics of so after the quench .    understanding the robustness of topological order to a dynamical perturbation is not the only motivation of this work .",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum many - body systems has been theoretically studied since several decades  @xcite .",
    "the impressive experimental progresses in the field of ultra - cold atomic gases ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) spurred a great deal of interest and a consequent renewed theoretical activity  @xcite .",
    "a prominent portion of this activity on non - equilibrium dynamics has focused on quenches , this special attention being in part motivated by the fact that current experiments can easily implement this protocol .",
    "thanks to the amazing progresses in the quantum simulation of effective spin models through one - dimensional chains of trapped ions and cold atoms  @xcite , these questions are not a mere academic curiosity , but retain an experimental relevance . in particular , since both string operators  @xcite and the short - time dynamics of closed quantum systems are experimentally accessible , it is possible to envision an experimental verification of our results in the near term future .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the presence of these edge modes makes the aklt state four - fold degenerate on an open chain , whereas in the presence of periodic boundary conditions it is non - degenerate .",
    "this phenomenology is intimately related to the existence of so .",
    "indeed , both these features can be regarded as a consequence of a hidden symmetry breaking related to the @xmath11 group : @xmath12 note that even if @xmath9 is left invariant by the action of @xmath13 , there is no contradiction in the fact that symmetry - breaking might occur in a one - dimensional system at zero - temperature because the group is finite .",
    "the aklt open chain can be mapped onto a local ferromagnetic chain with four symmetry - broken magnetic states by means of a non - local transformation ( the kennedy - tasaki transformation )  @xcite .",
    "string operators in the aklt chain are mapped onto two - point spin correlators which reveal ferromagnetic order , and thus , in this dual picture , string operators reveal the presence of hidden , long - range antiferromagnetic order , as earlier proposed in ref .",
    "so can be considered as the nonlocal order parameter which identifies states in the haldane phase , and its relation to hidden long - range order has also been discussed in different contexts  @xcite .",
    "because of the special role of the symmetry group @xmath14 , the haldane phase is better referred to as a symmetry - protected topological phase . indeed , it has been shown that a perturbation @xmath15 which is not left invariant by the group @xmath14 destroys so in the ground state .",
    "more rigorously , it has been demonstrated that the presence of so is equivalent to the existence of a local symmetry  @xcite ; in the case of the aklt state , this means that so is related to the fact that @xmath5 is invariant with respect to the action of @xmath14 . in the absence of such symmetry , so will exponentially vanish on increasing the length of the string  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we start recapitulating the theory of global quantum quenches applied to so developed in ref .  @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the evolution of string order in a spin-1 chain following a quantum quench . </S>",
    "<S> after initializing the chain in the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki state , we analyze in detail how string order evolves as a function of time at different length scales . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian after the quench is chosen either to preserve or to suddenly break the symmetry which ensures the presence of string order . </S>",
    "<S> depending on which of these two situations arises , string order is either preserved or lost even at infinitesimal times in the thermodynamic limit . the fact that non - local order may be abruptly destroyed , what we call _ string - order melting _ , makes it qualitatively different from typical order parameters in the manner of landau . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is thoroughly characterized by means of numerical simulations based on matrix product states algorithms and analytical studies based on a short - time expansion for several simplified models . </S>"
