    "at low - redshift , powerful radio galaxies are hosted by giant ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the inference that high - redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ; @xmath3 ) host a supermassive ( @xmath4 m@xmath5 ) black hole @xcite , and the close connection between the mass of the black hole and that of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , provides an evolutionary path to the present - day giant ellipticals .",
    "hzrgs are therefore excellent laboratories for studying the evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "most hzrgs found to date have been selected on the basis of their steep radio spectral index @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 for flux density @xmath8 at frequency @xmath9 ) , since ultra - steep - spectrum ( uss ; @xmath10 ) radio galaxies are more likely to be found at @xmath3 @xcite . the physical basis for this so - called @xmath11 correlation",
    "was previously thought to be due to a concave radio galaxy spectrum that was assumed to steepen to higher frequencies .",
    "the steeper part of the spectrum would be redshifted , giving a steeper spectral index at a given observed frequency for a high - redshift source than a low - redshift one .",
    "however , this interpretation has recently been challenged by @xcite who introduced a new paradigm for interpreting the radio spectra of high - redshift massive galaxies , in which uss massive galaxies are located in extremely dense environments , comparable to rich clusters of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the high ambient gas density in this environment means that the radio lobes are pressure - confined and lose their energy slowly by synchrotron and inverse compton losses ( rather than rapidly by adiabatic expansion as occurs in more rarefied environments at low redshift ) .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then not only do radio galaxies represent the extreme limit of the galaxy mass function at early times , they may also locate the most extreme overdensities of matter in the early universe .",
    "the number density of hzrgs is low , only a few times @xmath12mpc@xmath13 @xcite . of these",
    ", 96 per cent are detected to @xmath14 @xcite and hence a @xmath1-band survey is an efficient method of identifying the hosts of uss radio - selected galaxies .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of old ( @xmath15gyr ) stars peaks in the near - infrared at low redshift , while that of young blue stars dominates the @xmath1-band at high redshift , and therefore it has been argued that the @xmath1-band emission can be assumed to trace the stellar mass .",
    "hzrgs have the highest @xmath1-band luminosities in the early universe , and are brighter than optically - selected galaxies at all redshifts , which demonstrates that radio galaxies are among the most massive galaxies at all epochs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they follow a well - known linear and @xmath1 magnitude corresponds to a power - law relation between @xmath16 and @xmath17 m flux . ]",
    "correlation between redshift and @xmath1 magnitude , the @xmath1@xmath16 relation @xcite , which is an efficient tool for filtering out the low - redshift galaxies , leaving a smaller sample of potential high - redshift objects for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "we have carried out a search in the southern hemisphere designed to find high - redshift ( @xmath3 ) radio galaxies , to study their evolution , and to form a significant sample of those at @xmath18 for a detailed quantitative study of their environments .",
    "this is the first survey in the south to use sensitive low - frequency catalogues to data mine a large area of sky , and it became possible with the completion of the 843-mhz sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the reanalysis of the 408-mhz molonglo cross data @xcite to give the revised molonglo reference catalogue ( mrcr ; crawford , private communication ) .",

    "we have adopted a flat , @xmath19 cold dark matter cosmology with @xmath20 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the sources for our survey were selected by cross - matching    \\(i ) the 843-mhz sumss catalogue ,    \\(ii ) the 408mhz mrcr , which lowered the earlier mrc flux density limit of 0.95jy to @xmath24200mjy ( @xmath25 ) , and    \\(iii ) the 1400-mhz nvss @xcite in the overlap region with sumss ( declination @xmath26 to @xmath27 ) .",
    "we then selected sources with a spectral index between 408 to 843mhz , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( to avoid confusion from the galactic plane ) .",
    "double lobed sources were inspected by eye to ensure that both components were included in the flux density measure .",
    "minimum flux density cut - offs of 200mjy and 15mjy were applied to the mrcr and nvss catalogues respectively to improve the accuracy of the spectral indices .",
    "the target selection is discussed in detail in .",
    "radio images were obtained with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in several runs in 20032006 .",
    "both 1384- and 2368-mhz images were needed to pinpoint the @xmath1-band identification .",
    "the full details of the radio observations and reduction are given in where the analysis was done with natural - weighted images .",
    "however , in this paper , in cases where the @xmath1-band counterpart was not clear , we used uniform - weighted images as they have better resolution of @xmath30arcsec@xmath31 at 2368mhz .",
    "higher - resolution observations were obtained for 29 sources on ut 2008 january 16  20 .",
    "dual - frequency observations at 4800 and 8640 mhz were carried out with a @xmath32 mhz bandwidth correlator configuration .",
    "the 6a array configuration was used , spanning baselines from 337 to 5939 m. the median integration time per source was @xmath2470 min , consisting of well - spaced cuts of 34 min in duration .",
    "pks b1934@xmath33638 was used as the primary calibrator , while phase calibrators were observed every 20 min .",
    "a log of observations for the 4800- and 8640-mhz data is given in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "the data were reduced with miriad @xcite , following a procedure similar to that described in .",
    "we used natural weighting to optimise the sensitivity ; the median angular resolution is @xmath34 arcsec@xmath31 at 4800 mhz and @xmath35 arcsec@xmath31 at 8640 mhz .",
    "clean boxes were defined using both the automatically constrained clean technique described in , and manual selection where necessary .",
    "after the clean regions had been defined , each dirty image was cleaned to 23 times the theoretical rms noise level ; typically only @xmath24100 iterations were necessary .",
    "phase - only self - calibration was then used to improve the dynamic range .",
    "the median rms noise levels are 0.14 mjybeam@xmath21 at 4800 mhz and 0.20 mjybeam@xmath21 at 8640 mhz ; the measured rms noise level is in close agreement with the theoretical value in all but a handful of the clean images .",
    "we estimate that the typical positional uncertainty is @xmath36arcsec at both 4800 and 8640mhz .",
    "however , in a handful of cases , the positional uncertainty may be up to @xmath240.5arcsec at 8640mhz because of poor phase stability .",
    "the @xmath1-band observations are listed in the log of observations in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "a @xmath37 filter was used for the @xmath1-band imaging .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     nvss  j111921@xmath33363139 ( see fig .  [ highres ] ) has extended @xmath1-band emission which can not be fitted by an ellipsoid , with broad patches of emission lined up along the radio axis .",
    "this morphology has been previously associated with either ionisation cones or the presence of dust in the host galaxy . at the redshift of the host galaxy ( @xmath38 )",
    "there are no prominent emission lines in the @xmath37-band filter , so we may be seeing either an inclined dust lane , through which the nucleus can be seen ( similar to eso 248-g10 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or widely distributed dust and star formation along the radio jet axis .      in some earlier papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the @xmath1-band magnitudes have been converted to an equivalent 64-kpc aperture value .",
    "this value was chosen by @xcite because it corresponds to an 8-arcsec aperture at @xmath39 .",
    "[ kk ] , based on data from @xcite , shows that the actual correction to the @xmath1-band magnitudes is quite small and applies over the full magnitude and redshift range .",
    "the basis of the empirical correction adopted by @xcite is that the integrated emission of galaxies at @xmath40 within an aperture of radius @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath42 . while a profile of this form may be an acceptable fit to nearby , bright galaxies , the galaxies in our sample are faint and distant , and the @xmath43band images are not deep enough to justify fitting such a profile .    at high redshift ( @xmath3 )",
    "it is expected that many galaxies are still in the process of merging and have not yet relaxed to an elliptical profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an @xmath42 profile is therefore unlikely to apply over an epoch range as large as @xmath44@xmath45 .",
    "this is supported by @xcite who found that the surface brightness profiles of @xmath46 hzrgs are steeper than those at @xmath47 .",
    "the assumption of a ` universal ' radial profile then introduces an added error , estimated to be as large as 20 per cent . a contribution to",
    "this error comes from the chosen starting aperture which could , in principle , be based on the profile of the galaxy .",
    "the practical issue , however , is that profiles can not be determined accurately for the faint and distant galaxies . as a result",
    ", some authors have adopted an 8-arcsec aperture from which to convert to a 64-kpc aperture based on the simplicity of their equivalence at @xmath39 . in practice",
    "an 8-arcsec aperture is often too large to avoid including additional flux from nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that the majority of hzrgs in their sample have most of their flux contained within a 2-arcsec aperture .    in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] we plot the radial profiles of our @xmath1-band identifications with @xmath48 and @xmath49 representing nominal high- and low - redshift groups respectively .",
    "almost all the galaxies have their total emission enclosed by a 4-arcsec aperture , with no difference between the brighter and fainter sources .",
    "infrared imaging is relatively insensitive to low - surface - brightness emission , and for most of our objects , the flux has dropped to the background sky level within a 4-arcsec aperture . on the other hand , there are frequent cases where the intensity increases again beyond a radius of 2 arcsec , indicating contaminating emission from a nearby source . for the sources in our sample , therefore , we do not believe there is any significant missing flux in the 4-arcsec apertures . extending the aperture to",
    "8-arcsec adds sky noise , which increases the error .    over the large time interval from @xmath50 to the present ,",
    "galaxies undergo significant evolution .",
    "we have no evidence that one physical size scale is a reasonable representation of hzrgs which may range over a factor of ten in mass @xcite and which we observe at different evolutionary stages in their formation . for these reasons ,",
    "we have chosen not to use 64-kpc - aperture magnitudes , and instead to use 4-arcsec - aperture magnitudes in this paper .",
    "essentially all uss - selected hzrg samples have selection biases resulting from the different spectral index cut - offs and selection frequencies , which results in samples with vastly different flux density distributions .",
    "a k - correction was thought to underpin the effectiveness of uss - selection as a steepening radio sed would be shifted with redshift to lower frequencies and therefore the highest redshift objects would be steepest at a given observed frequency @xcite . therefore uss samples selected at lower frequencies should net a higher redshift distribution .",
    "this theory was challenged by @xcite who found that the seds of sources in the 843-mhz - selected sumss ",
    "nvss sample are predominantly straight .",
    "sumss sample was then selected at the lower frequency of 408mhz , and the resulting @xmath1-band magnitude and 1400mhz flux density distributions are compared in fig .",

    "the mccarthy sample is a set of 277 @xmath1-band observations of radio galaxies , of which 175 have redshifts .",
    "while it remains unpublished , it is the largest non - uss @xmath1-band sample and therefore provides an interesting comparison with the other samples discussed here .",
    "we obtained 1400mhz flux density values for the mccarthy sample by cross - matching the positions with the nvss catalogue within a 60-arcsec search radius .",
    "for the 38 of the 293 sources which had two matches within 60arcsec , we selected the closest match .",

    "the 1400mhz flux densities were obtained from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) by selecting the most recently published total integrated flux density . in several cases only peak flux densities were available and 26 targets have no published observations at 1400mhz . while the 3crr/6c@xmath51/6ce/7crs combined sample is less complete in 1400mhz flux density than the other samples shown in fig .",
    "[ k_shist ] , it has a more complete redshift follow - up ( see paperiii ) .",

    "sumss sample is much larger than the other uss - selected samples in terms of the number of @xmath1 measurements , and therefore will give a more complete picture of uss radio galaxy redshift distributions once the spectroscopic followup is complete .",
    "the most striking result is that even though the uss - selected samples each have completely different selection criteria and vary by a factor of 3.5 in median flux density , the resultant @xmath1-band distributions are the same , and are fainter than for the non - uss - selected samples .",
    "the non - uss - selected samples have vastly different flux density distributions , but have similar @xmath1-band medians that are brighter than the uss - selected samples .",
    "therefore the effectiveness of uss - selection in identifying fainter and potentially higher - redshift galaxies in the samples shown , is not dependent on the selection frequency or the resultant flux density distributions of these samples .",

    "<S> we have compiled a sample of 234 ultra - steep - spectrum ( uss ) selected radio sources in order to find high - redshift radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the sample covers the declination range @xmath0 in the overlap region between the 1400-mhz nrao vla sky survey , 408-mhz revised molonglo reference catalogue and the 843-mhz sydney university molonglo sky survey ( the mrcr  </S>",
    "<S> sumss sample ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the second in a series of papers on the mrcr  </S>",
    "<S> sumss sample , and here we present the @xmath1-band ( 2.2@xmath2 m ) imaging of 173 of the sources primarily from the magellan and the anglo - australian telescopes . we detect a counterpart to the radio source in 93 per cent of the new @xmath1-band images which , along with previously published data , makes this the largest published sample of @xmath1-band counterparts to uss - selected radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the @xmath1-band identification has been compared to the features of the radio emission for the double sources . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the identification is most likely to lie near the midpoint of the radio lobes rather than closer to the brighter lobe , making the centroid a less likely place to find the optical counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> 79 per cent of the identifications are less than 1arcsec from the radio lobe axis . </S>",
    "<S> these results differ from studies of low - redshift radio samples where the environments are typically not nearly so dense and disturbed as those at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to some literature samples , we find that the majority of our sample shows no alignment between the near - infrared and radio axes . </S>",
    "<S> several different morphologies of aligned structures are found and those that are aligned within 10degrees are consistent with jet - induced star formation . the distribution and median value of the @xmath1-band magnitudes for the mrcr  </S>",
    "<S> sumss sample are found to be similar to several other uss - selected samples even though each sample has a very different median 1400mhz flux density . </S>",
    "<S> uss - selection from a lower - radio - frequency sample has not netted fainter @xmath1-band magnitudes , which may imply that the k - correction is not responsible for the effectiveness of uss - selection . </S>",
    "<S> due to space constraints , lower resolution figures are shown here , and the full resolution is available in the mnras published paper .    # 1to 0pt#1    [ firstpage ]    galaxies : active  surveys  galaxies : high - redshift  infrared : galaxies  radio continuum : galaxies . </S>"
