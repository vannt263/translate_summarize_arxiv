    "i then used movies from the dutch open telescope and [ fig : disk - images ] reside there also , under _ dot movies_. ] ( ) to argue that much so - called chromosphere is actually transition region , that much other so - called chromosphere is actually upper photosphere , and that only those  mottles and fibrils that span across and between internetwork cells and active regions constitute the actual chromosphere .",
    "i compress the argument here into a two - figure summary of the evidence and a list of brief conjectures with explanatory cartoons .",
    "the upshot is that radiation modeling of the field - guided filamentary features ( mottles , fibrils , spicules , `` straws '' ) that infest  if not constitute  the quiet - sun domain between photosphere and corona should mix steep gradients in varied configurations with thick - to - thin radiation simulation containing everything from lte to coronal conditions .",
    "one conjecture is that the latter dominate such things as  superbasal magnetic - activity emissivity , making that a transition - region diagnostic .",

    "modeling : chromospheric modeling should upgrade to the comprehensive val / fal radiation treatment of @xcite and @xcite which covers the whole gamut from high - density lte in their photospheric bottoms through nlte and prd to coronal conditions at their @xmath28k model tops  but not in 1d radial geometry but for chromospheric cylinders and sheets , with variation in orientation , density , and temperature , embedded in coronal or upper - photosphere surroundings , and possessing transition - region sheaths to these and upward coronal contact as in types 1 and 2 .",
    "the next step is to feed them mass from below through dynamic pistoning including @xmath15-modes and convective squirting ( @xcite ) , and energy from above through conduction .",
    "nomenclature : the _ chromosphere _ consists primarily of type-3 mottles and fibrils . they appear as a crowded forest at the limb and collectively cause the purple +  flash at the onset of totality for which the chromosphere is rightfully named .",

    "the _ transition region _ is extremely warped , consisting of the regime e parts of type-1 straws plus the d - f interface in type 2 mottles plus thin low - emissivity d - f sheaths along type 2 and 3 mottles . as a spherical shell it exists only around the fictitious but superbly didactic star valiii ( @xcite ) .",
    "cool - star activity : the superbasal ``  emission '' which is so useful as stellar activity indicator ( , ) comes primarily from type 1 structures , just like and other uv lines .",
