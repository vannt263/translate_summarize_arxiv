    "vibrational molecular motion is an interesting and important example of complex dynamics . due to nonlinearity , nonadiabatic effects and interactions with the environment ,",
    "the behavior of such systems is remarkably rich , and their theoretical description away from the equilibrium becomes a challenge . in many cases , e.g. when the frequencies of the vibrational modes do not exceed the temperature ,",
    "a completely classical description is adequate .",
    "the dynamics far from equilibrium is typically irregular and can exhibit chaotic features . in the extreme case of strong chaos all trajectories in phase space are unstable , and",
    "the phase - space dynamics shows mixing features .",
    "spectroscopic methods represent powerful tools for obtaining detailed information on vibrational dynamics .",
    "the outcome of spectroscopic experiments can be naturally interpreted in terms of optical response functions , either in the time or in frequency domain .",
    "the multi - time ( nonlinear ) response functions that constitute the main objects in multi - dimensional time - domain spectroscopy are usually analyzed using their spectral decompositions , i.e. the fourier transforms with respect to the time intervals .",
    "these time intervals can be viewed as the time delays between the exciting pulses , provided the latter are short compared to the typical time scales of the system dynamics .",
    "periodic features of response functions are routinely interpreted as signatures of periodic motions .",
    "the central frequencies of diagonal and off - diagonal ( cross ) peaks are associated with some coherent vibrations , whereas the peak shapes contain information on the system - bath coupling .",
    "smooth behavior of response functions in the case of almost harmonic vibration of the primary system is achieved due to its coupling to a macroscopically large number of the bath motions .",
    "the bath is often considered in the harmonic approximation : such model is known in the spectroscopic literature as a multi - mode brownian oscillator .",
    "the situation is totally different in the case of chaotic motion of the primary system .",
    "the spectrum of a strongly chaotic system is known to consist of so - called ruelle - pollicott ( rp ) resonances that represent the eigenmodes of the perron - frobenius operator @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of any particular resonance describes an oscillating feature in the system correlations , whereas its real part is responsible for the correlations decay .",
    "an individual rp resonance is not directly related to any particular periodic motion , although their positions can be expressed in terms of all periodic orbits in a very collective way via the dynamical @xmath0-function .",
    "these collective resonances in chaotic systems should be distinguished from the signatures of stable periodic motions .",
    "nonlinear response functions of quantum systems can be conveniently represented in terms of spectral decompositions via the system s stationary states .",
    "these spectral decompositions that are often referred to as bloembergen s expressions allow to relate resonances in the spectroscopic measurement data to the transitions between the stationary states . a natural question that arises in the context of approaching the classical limit is what would be the classical counterpart of the quantum liouville space spectral decomposition for the linear and nonlinear response functions ?",
    "in quantum mechanics the system state can be described by a density matrix , whereas the evolution is governed by the quantum liouville operator .",
    "one can try to reach the classical limit by replacing the quantum density matrix by the classical phase - space distribution using the wigner transformation .",
    "the quantum liouville operator should be naturally replaced by its classical counterpart .",
    "this conceptually straightforward approach , however , faces certain major difficulties .",
    "quantum liouville operators are second - order elliptic operators , whose eigenstates belong to certain natural hilbert spaces . in particular in the case of compact ( restricted )",
    "coordinate spaces the corresponding spectra are discrete , and finding spectral decompositions does not face conceptual difficulties , at least on the physical level of rigor .",
    "the situation with the classical limit is much more involved since the classical liouville operator is a first - order non - elliptic operator that describes the propagation of phase - space distributions along classical trajectories . in particular",
    "any non - periodic classical trajectory generates a family of eigenstates of the classical liouville operator , concentrated on the trajectory with all possible eigenvalues .",
    "such a spectrum contains no useful information on the system relaxation .",
    "a meaningful spectrum that provides detailed information on the relaxation of a strongly chaotic system is known to be represented by the rp resonances .",
    "one of the ways to reproduce the rp resonances as eigenvalues of the classical liouville operator is based on the appropriate simultaneous definition of the functional space where the operator acts .",
    "these functional hilbert spaces , often referred to as rigged spaces , are very different from `` standard '' hilbert spaces involved in spectral decompositions of quantum operators .",
    "they are usually chosen on the case - to - case basis .    to avoid these difficulties we follow a more physical approach introduced in ref . .",
    "the approach is based on introducing weak langevin noise , followed by considering the limit of vanishing noise .",
    "it has several major advantages .",
    "first of all , this describes a realistic situation since any system is at least weakly coupled to some environment , and in many cases the system - bath coupling can be described on the level of langevin noise .",
    "second , it allows to avoid dealing with a problem of choice of the appropriate hilbert space .",
    "the stochastic langevin processes can be described by adding a diffusion operator to the liouville operator @xmath1 , which results in the fokker - planck operator @xmath2 .",
    "the fokker - planck operator @xmath3 is a second - order elliptic operator , and its spectral decomposition is free of the aforementioned difficulties that arise in the case of classical liouville operator .",
    "the rp resonances are obtained from the spectrum of the fokker - planck operator by taking the limit @xmath4 .",
    "this allows to interpret introducing infinitesimal noise as a regularization procedure similar to coarse graining .",
    "the dependence of the eigenfunctions of the fokker - planck operator @xmath3 on the noise strength @xmath5 is nonanalytical . in the limit @xmath4 of the vanishing noise strength the smooth eigenfunctions turn into generalized functions ( distributions ) .",
    "the rigged hilbert spaces are reproduced from the `` standard '' hilbert spaces in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "they are spanned on the generalized eigenfunction obtained from the eigenfunctions of @xmath6 by applying the noiseless limit .",
    "the calculation of the linear response function in terms of the generalized functions does not pose a problem , since the expression involves an expansion of the smooth function over generalized functions .",
    "the calculation of nonlinear response functions is essentially more complicated because one needs to define expansions of the generalized functions over similar generalized functions .",
    "we avoid dealing with the latter problem by performing all calculations for weak , yet finite noise , followed by applying the limit @xmath4 to the final expressions .    in our previous work @xcite",
    "we demonstrated the convergence of the second - order response function for strongly chaotic systems .",
    "as an example of the strong chaos , we considered free motion on a compact surface of constant negative curvature .",
    "the model has been studied since more than a century and served as a prototype for quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "the motion on a surface of genus @xmath7 is in particular known as a hadamard billiard . using the dynamical symmetry ( ds ) of the system we found analytical expressions for the response functions .",
    "the long - time asymptotic expansion of the second - order response function turned out to have the form of the double decomposition in the resonances that appear in the linear response .",
    "in the present work we find the decomposition of the linear and nonlinear response in ruelle - pollicott resonances for this classical strongly chaotic model by introducing weak langevin noise .",
    "the spectral decomposition in this case is conceptually straightforward .",
    "we further demonstrate that the decomposition coefficients converge in the noiseless limit @xmath4 , and the resulting spectral decompositions reproduce the asymptotic expansions for the purely classical response functions computed in our earlier work @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first calculation of the classical nonlinear response for a chaotic flow that uses spectral decomposition based on the noise regularization .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "ds with respect to the action of the group @xmath33 does not mean symmetry in a usual sense , i.e. that the system dynamics commutes with the group action , but rather reflects the fact that the vector field @xmath34 that determines the classical dynamics is represented by an element of the corresponding lie algebra @xmath31 , whereas the stable and unstable directions of our hyperbolic flow are determined by @xmath35 .",
    "the algebra generators @xmath36 , @xmath37 are anti - hermitian , i.e. satisfy the equalities @xmath38 with respect to the natural scalar product @xmath39 . in addition , the poisson bracket of two functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 reads @xmath42    the smooth action of @xmath43 in @xmath14 can be interpreted as that the space @xmath44 of smooth functions in @xmath14 constitutes a representation of @xmath45 , which turns out to be a unitary representation ( see refs . ) , and therefore can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible representations of @xmath45 . stated differently , any distribution in the reduced phase space @xmath14 can be decomposed in irreducible representations .",
    "ds implies that the distributions in different representations evolve independently .",
    "we focus on the principal series representations of @xmath32 since only these provide experimentally interesting contributions to the linear and second - order response @xcite .",
    "a principal series representation @xmath46 is labeled by an imaginary number @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "eigenfunctions @xmath49 of the momentum rotation operator @xmath50 , hereafter also referred to as angular harmonics , form a convenient basis set in the irreducible representation @xmath46 .",
    "the functions @xmath51 do not depend on the momentum direction and can be viewed as eigenfunctions of the laplacian operator on our compact riemann surface @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the laplacian eigenvalues provide a set of numbers @xmath52 according to the equation @xmath53 .",
    "the angular harmonics have the following properties : @xmath54 where we introduced the raising and lowering operators @xmath55 .",

    "the description of unitary representations of @xmath45 @xcite allows us to identify the functions @xmath58 in reduced phase space with the corresponding functions on the circle @xmath59 for any @xmath52 . in the case of the principal series @xmath60 , @xmath48 , and @xmath59 form an orthogonal normalized basis set with the natural scalar product .",
    "therefore , the normalized functions @xmath58 are naturally associated with @xmath61 . on the circle",
    "the algebra generators are represented by ( see @xcite ) @xmath62    using the dynamical symmetry ( ds ) of the problem , one can calculate the response functions .",
    "two - point correlations that are related to the linear response via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem have been also considered in ref . .",
    "detailed calculations of the response functions are presented in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "since the zero harmonics @xmath51 are momentum - independent , the expansion of the dipole @xmath63 in irreducible representations has the form @xmath64 where only the principle series contributions are retained .",
    "typically the dipole is represented by a smooth distribution , and , therefore , only a small number @xmath65 of representations are relevant in the expansion .",
    "for the sake of the presentation clarity we focus on the case @xmath66 .",
    "generalizations to @xmath67 are straightforward and can be easily performed .",
    "strongly chaotic systems are characterized by complicated irregular dynamics @xcite . exponential divergence of initially close trajectories and mixing make the description in terms of individual trajectories complicated and inadequate .",
    "an alternative picture , based on liouville representation of classical mechanics , involves propagating phase space densities .",
    "suppose that the system initially occupies a certain region in the phase space which correspond to a range of initial phase space variables .",
    "in the course of the evolution of a chaotic system , the shape of the region becomes stretched along the unstable directions and contracted along the stable ones .",
    "the response functions characterize the system response to a time - dependent external driving field @xmath68 and constitute the basic outcome of spectroscopic measurements . the external field",
    "is coupled to the system via the polarization @xmath63 , also often referred to as the dipole .",
    "the function @xmath69 of the system coordinates is the classical counterpart of the polarization operator .",
    "the total classical hamiltonian of the system coupled to the driving field has the form @xmath70    the initial equilibrium phase space distribution @xmath71 starts to evolve once the external field is turned on .",
    "the phase space density @xmath72 at time @xmath73 depends on the values of the external field at preceding times . in most cases",
    "the observed signal at time @xmath73 is directly related to the same polarization @xmath63 , which describes the system - field coupling . within the classical mechanics",
    "formalism the observed polarization is given by @xmath74 .",
    "the evolution of the phase space distribution @xmath75 is governed by the classical liouville equation @xmath76 where the liouville operator @xmath34 acts as the poisson bracket with the hamiltonian according to eq .",
    "( [ liouville - operator ] ) .",
    "the sign of the poisson bracket is defined by a convention that @xmath77 for canonically conjugate coordinates @xmath78 and momenta @xmath11 .",
    "note that the liouville operator is a first - order linear differential operator .",
    "as stated earlier , it can be identified with the vector field @xmath79 in the phase space .",
    "the liouville operator is anti - hermitian with respect to the conventional scalar product , so that @xmath80 .",
    "this makes the evolution operator @xmath81 unitary and leads to the conservation of phase space volume ( liouville theorem )",

    "( [ liouville - equation ] ) iteratively considering the right - hand side as a small perturbation and taking @xmath71 for the zero approximation .",
    "then the phase space density , and hence the response ( observed signal ) can be naturally represented in the form of the functional taylor expansion over the external field .",
    "the @xmath82-th order response function @xmath83 is defined as the coefficient ( more precisely , an integral kernel ) in front of the @xmath82-th power of the driving field .",
    "the response function @xmath83 depends on @xmath84 time moments , and if the unperturbed system is initially at equilibrium , it actually depends on @xmath82 time intervals .    for the linear and second - order response functions we have the following expressions : @xmath85    here @xmath86 is the the phase space density evolution operator , often referred to as the perron - frobenius operator .",
    "we understand @xmath87 as the solution @xmath88 of the equation @xmath89 with the initial condition @xmath90 .",
    "since @xmath34 is a first - order differential operator , the solution can be readily found using the method of characteristics . in other words ,",
    "the first - order operator @xmath34 allows to write @xmath91 .",
    "phase space trajectories found from the hamilton equations of motion are invariant with respect to the time reversal .",
    "this property is easily observed in the behavior of integrable systems .",
    "namely , any integrable dynamics can be represented by a set of quasiperiodic motions , which implies reversibility and recurrence in the values of physical observables .",
    "the behavior of chaotic systems is quite different .",
    "although described by the same formalism based on eqs .",
    "( [ liouville - operator ] ) and ( [ liouville - equation ] ) that possess time - reversal symmetry , one observes obviously irreversible features such as relaxation phenomena .    the apparent paradox and its solution are well known in statistical mechanics .",
    "in the course of evolution of a chaotic system , more and more fine features develop in the phase space distribution .",
    "the distribution width decreases exponentially along the stable directions . at the same time",
    ", physical quantities are represented by smooth functions in phase space",
    ". therefore , fine features of the distribution are actually irrelevant for the smooth observables .",
    "in particular , this results in the exponential damping of the linear and nonlinear response functions in a strongly chaotic system @xcite .",
    "only coarse grained properties of the phase space density remain relevant .",
    "for instance , in the long - time asymptotic , the strongly chaotic system may be found in the neighborhood of any point of the phase space with equal probability , which is reflected in the homogeneity of the stationary phase space density .",
    "a physically useful and meaningful definition of the evolution operator which relates initial and final distributions must rely on some kind of regularization that eliminates unnecessary distracting details .",
    "coarse graining can be introduced either directly in phase space or , alternatively , in the functional space of phase space distributions .",
    "sometimes coarse graining is inevitable , e.g. in computer simulations , where numerical errors determine the precision .",
    "the finest scale of classical dynamics is limited by the onset of quantum effects .",
    "one of well - known examples is the quasiclassical calculation of the entropy .",
    "quantum effects were also shown to remove unphysical power - law divergences in the nonlinear response functions of integrable systems @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the limit @xmath92 should be taken after calculating the long - time asymptotics .",
    "this property resembles the characteristic feature of our approach to the second - order response in a chaotic system , as presented below .",
    "besides , real physical systems are never isolated .",
    "the influence of an environment shows up as noise or random forces at the level of equations of motion , and as unobservable degrees of freedom and diffusive behavior of relevant variables in the statistical description .",
    "although in many cases interaction with the environment is sufficiently weak and can be neglected , it is often utilized as a convenient and physically meaningful way to perform calculations .    the effect of the diffusion in the chaotic system is to regularize the long - time dynamics and to introduce irreversible leveling of gradients in the stable direction .",
    "we regularize the operator generating the density evolution by adding a small diffusive term in the form of the second - order differential operator : @xmath93 since @xmath94 generates rotations of the momentum , @xmath95 has the meaning of the angular diffusion coefficient .",
    "factor @xmath96 is chosen for reasons of convenience .",
    "we will be interested in the case @xmath97 .",
    "as we will see , the limit @xmath4 does exist in the spectral decomposition , therefore in the limit the factor does not play any role .",
    "the resulting fokker - planck operator @xmath98 defines the evolution of the phase space density .",
    "this statistical description for the density is equivalent to the description in terms of the langevin equations for the dynamical variables .",
    "such equations contain a random force which tends to change the momentum direction keeping the energy constant .",
    "this can be formally described by a stochastic liouville operator @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a random gaussian markovian process with the zero mean .",
    "the noise intensity is determined by @xmath5 , and the two - point correlation function reads @xmath101    the addition of the diffusion term with the second derivative defines the spectrum of the resulting operator in the space of smooth functions .",
    "the eigenfunctions become regular , differentiable functions . as we will see , they are still singular at @xmath102 , and in the limit @xmath4 they turn into generalized functions , which is natural for the case of a small parameter in front of the highest derivative .",
    "the mixing property of chaos makes the type of noise irrelevant .",
    "random force exerted on any of the phase space variables affects other variables if they are not fixed by conservation laws .",
    "thus , in the reduced phase space represented by the shell of constant energy the mixing leads to the fast and irregular randomization of the position variables @xmath78 .    as a result ,",
    "the liouville equation ( [ liouville - equation ] ) that describes the phase space density evolution in a system perturbed by an external field @xmath103 , is replaced by the fokker - planck equation : @xmath104 the evolution operator in the unperturbed system can be written symbolically as @xmath105 , in a full analogy with the noiseless case .",
    "similarly , the iterative solution of eq .",
    "( [ fokker - planck - equation ] ) yields the phase space density in a form of an expansion in powers of @xmath103 .",
    "the response functions are obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ first - order ] ) by replacing @xmath34 with @xmath106 : @xmath107 where angular brackets stand for the integral over the reduced phase space , and we defined the action of the operator @xmath108 on a function @xmath109 as the poisson bracket of @xmath110 and @xmath109 so that @xmath111 .",
    "in the well - known situation with quantum response , the response functions can be readily represented in the form of spectral decompositions , since the infinitesimal evolution is determined by a hermitian operator .",
    "the conjugation property with respect to a simple scalar product facilitates expansions in the basis of the eigenstates .",

    "is an anti - hermitian first - order differential operator .",
    "however , the fokker - planck operator @xmath98 is obtained by adding a second - order hermitian contribution to @xmath1 .",
    "this makes the resulting operator @xmath98 neither hermitian nor anti - hermitian .",
    "namely , its adjoint is @xmath113 it seems that there is no natural choice of the scalar product that would make our fokker - planck operator simply related to its adjoint .",
    "the expressions for the response functions include integrations over the reduced phase space .",
    "the convolution @xmath114 of two functions @xmath115 and @xmath116 can be recast in the form of the natural scalar product as @xmath117 .    as shown by the construction of eigenmodes in section [ section : eigenstates ] , the operator @xmath98 is diagonalizable in @xmath46 , and the jordan - block structures that are possible in a general case do not appear in our spectral decompositions .",
    "therefore , any function in @xmath118 can be expanded in the eigenfunctions @xmath119 that obey the equation @xmath120 the expansion coefficients are linear functionals of @xmath121 and hence can be represented by scalar products of @xmath121 with certain functions denoted by @xmath122 : @xmath123 it follows from the expansion of @xmath119 and @xmath124 that the functions @xmath122 are the eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath125 which satisfy the following properties : @xmath126    we focus our detailed treatment on the simplest case @xmath66 of a single irreducible representation contributing to the dipole moment @xmath63 .",
    "this corresponds to a single contribution in the expansion ( [ f - expansion ] ) , and below we imply @xmath127 .",
    "a generalization to an arbitrary linear combination of @xmath67 such terms with different @xmath47 is straightforward for both response functions under consideration @xcite .",
    "we can successively apply the expansion procedure ( [ varphi - expansion ] ) and obtain any response or correlation function as a spectral decomposition .",

    "( [ second - order - general1 ] ) , we in addition introduce a double expansion in the basis of the angular harmonics that are defined by eqs .",
    "( [ sigma - act - irred0 ] ) : @xmath129    the double expansion in the angular harmonics yields a geometric matrix element @xmath130 studied in our previous work @xcite . note that @xmath131 in the middle angular brackets contains a derivative @xmath132 acting on all functions of the momentum to the right of it .",
    "this complication occurs due to the absence of the integration over @xmath0 in the angular brackets which correspond to projections onto the basis set in @xmath46 .",
    "as stated earlier the fokker - planck operator ( [ fokker - planck - operator ] ) is neither hermitian nor anti - hermitian with respect to any natural scalar product and , therefore , not necessarily diagonalizable . in what follows ,",
    "we show that it actually is : we apply the representation on the circle to find its eigenstates and demonstrate that they constitute a basis set .",

    "however , since the hamiltonian does not contain first derivatives , we can define a symmetric ( non - hermitian ) scalar product @xmath140 so that the hamiltonian is self - adjoint with respect to it : @xmath141 .",

    "as we will see , only even eigenstates contribute to the spectral decompositions of response functions .",
    "therefore , we present the detailed expressions only for even eigenstates on the half - circle @xmath145 .",

    "the small parameter @xmath5 allows to solve the schrdinger equation using the wkb method .",
    "the imaginary part of the potential energy is small compared to its real part .",
    "this supports the use of such terms as the `` minimum '' of the potential and the `` under the barrier '' wave function .",
