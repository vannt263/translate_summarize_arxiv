    "( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "however , many basic issues remain unsolved even for a simple linear equation with constant coefficients .    in this paper",
    ", we study the following linear stochastic differential equation with distributed delay @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are constants , @xmath3 is a one dimensional wiener process , and @xmath4 represents the density function of the delay @xmath5 . in this study , we always assume it interpretation for the stochastic integral .",

    "particularly , this paper gives the characteristic function of the equation , through which sufficient conditions for the second moment to be bounded or unbounded are obtained .    despite the simplicity of , which is a linear equation with constant coefficients ,",
    "current understanding for how the stability and moment boundedness depend on the equation coefficients is still incomplete .",
    "most of known results are obtained through the method of lyapunov functional .",
    "the lyapunov functional method is useful for investigating the stability of differential equations , and has been well developed for delay differential equations @xcite , stochastic differential equations @xcite , and stochastic delay differential equations @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov functional method can usually give sufficient conditions for the stability of stochastic delay differential equations .",
    "for general results one can refer to the razumikhin - type theorems on the exponential stability for the stochastic functional differential equation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) .",
    "however , these results often depend on the method of how the lyapunov functional is constructed and are incomplete , not always applicable for all parameter regions . for example , sufficient conditions for the @xmath6 moment stability of following stochastic differential delay equation @xmath7 can be obtained when @xmath8 , but not for @xmath9 ( * ? ? ?",

    "lei and mackey @xcite introduced the method of laplace transform to study the stability and moment boundedness of the equation with discrete delay ( @xmath10 ) . in this particular case ,",
    "the characteristic equation was proposed , which yields a sufficient ( and is also necessary if not of the critical situation ) condition for the boundedness of the second moment ( see theorem 3.6 in @xcite ) .",
    "this result gives a complete description for the second moment stability of the equation ( the delay can be rescaled to @xmath11=1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is a disadvantage in the characteristic equation proposed in @xcite in that the characteristic function is not explicitly given by the equation coefficients .",

    "we briefly introduce basic results for the fundamental solutions of linear delay differential equations with distributed delay .",
    "main results and proofs of this paper are given in section 3 . in section 3.1",
    "we discuss the first moment stability and show that it is identical to that of the unperturbed delay differential equation ( theorem [ thm3.3 ] ) .",
    "section 3.2 focuses on the second moment .",
    "when the stochastic perturbation is an additive noise , the result is simple and the bounded condition for the second moment is the same as the stability condition for the unperturbed delay differential equation ( theorem [ thm3.4 ] ) .",
    "however , in the presence of multiplicative white noises , boundedness for the second moment depends on the perturbation terms .",
    "we prove that the second moment is unbounded provided that the trivial solution of the unperturbed equation is unstable ( theorem [ thm3.6 ] ) .",
    "when the trivial solution of the unperturbed equation is stable , we obtain a characteristic equation , and the boundedness of the second moments depends on the maximum real parts of all roots of the characteristic equation ( theorem [ thm3.8 ] ) .",
    "the characteristic function is given explicitly through the equation parameters . in section 4 , as applications , we obtain some useful conditions for the boundedness of the second moment in some special situations ( theorem [ thm4.1 ] ) , and also sufficient conditions for the second moment to be unbounded ( theorem [ thm4.2 ] ) . an example is studied in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we first give some basic results for the fundamental solution of a linear differential equation with distributed delay @xmath12 we also give sufficient and necessary conditions for the stability of the trivial solution of equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) , which are useful for the rest of this paper .",
