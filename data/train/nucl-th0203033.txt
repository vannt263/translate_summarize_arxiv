    "during the last fifteen years a quiet revolution has taken place in the perception of the nucleus . during this period the study of the ( e , e@xmath0p ) reaction has clarified the limits of validity of the mean - field description of nuclei . in particular ,",
    "absolute spectroscopic factors have been obtained for the removal of protons from many nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative features of the strength distribution suggest a considerable mixing between single - hole states and more complicated configurations , like two - hole@xmath7one - particle states .",
    "the resulting fragmentation pattern of the single - particle ( sp ) strength exhibits a single peak carrying about 65 - 70% of the strength for states in the immediate vicinity of the fermi energy , while more deeply bound orbitals display a strongly fragmented distribution reminiscent of a complex sp energy .",
    "in addition to these fragmentation features , an important depletion of the sp strength has been established which is associated with ground - state correlations induced by strong short - range and tensor correlations  @xcite .",
    "this leads to an overall reduction of the sp strength for all mean - field orbits in all nuclei by 10 - 15%  @xcite .",
    "this theoretical result has recently been confirmed also for deeply - bound orbits in an ( e , e@xmath0p ) experiment on @xmath8 in a wide domain of missing energy and momentum  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the ( e , e@xmath0p ) data has relied on the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) for both the coulomb distortion of the electron waves ( in heavy nuclei ) and the outgoing proton  @xcite .",
    "the proton distortion is described in terms of an optical potential required to describe elastic proton scattering data at relevant energies  @xcite .",
    "there is some uncertainty related to this treatment since elastic proton scattering is considered to be a surface reaction and no detailed information is obtained related to the interior of the nucleus .",
    "this uncertainty gives rise to an estimated error of about 10% .",
    "such an estimate may be inferred by considering the difference between the relativistic and nonrelativistic treatment of the proton distortion .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this difference is essentially due to the reduction of the interior wave function in the relativistic case .",
    "this feature can also be generated by including a reasonable amount of nonlocality in the optical potential  @xcite .",
    "a serious challenge to the interpretation of ( e , e@xmath0p ) experiments was recently published in refs .",
    "this challenge consists in questioning the validity of the constancy of the spectroscopic factor as a function of the four - momentum ( squared ) , @xmath1 , transferred by the virtual photon to the knocked - out nucleon . in ref .",
    "@xcite a conventional analysis of the world s data for ( e , e@xmath0p ) experiments on @xmath9 at low @xmath1 generated results consistent with previous expectations .",
    "data at higher values of @xmath1 were then analyzed within the framework of a theoretical model which employs skyrme - hartree - fock bound - state wave functions for the initial proton , a glauber - type description of the final - state interaction of the outgoing proton , and a factorization approximation for the electromagnetic vertex  @xcite . within the framework of this theoretical description ,",
    "spectroscopic factors were obtained which increase substantially with increasing @xmath1 for the @xmath9 nucleus .",
    "the spectroscopic factor is a many - body quantity defined without reference to a probe . for valence hole states in nuclei it simply represents the probability for the removal of a nucleon with prescribed quantum numbers from the ground state of the target while ending up in a state of the nucleus with one particle less . in the conventional analysis of the experimental data",
    "these quantum numbers involve the trivial values of parity and total angular momentum but also require the corresponding wave function to be a solution of a woods - saxon potential at the appropriate binding energy .",
    "this potential is adjusted to generate an optimum description of the shape of the experimental cross section .",
    "the resulting theoretical representation of the cross section must then be multiplied by a constant factor to coincide with the experimental cross section .",
    "this constant factor is then interpreted as the spectroscopic factor . another important ingredient in this analysis",
    "is the choice of the electron - proton cross section which must be considered off - shell  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a small additional uncertainty in the analysis of low @xmath1 data as discussed recently in ref .",
    ".    further clarification of this intriguing situation with different spectroscopic factors at different @xmath1 is urgently needed . for this purpose",
    "we consider in this paper a study of recently published ( e , e@xmath0p ) data for @xmath10 at @xmath3 ( gev/@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "an unfactorized approach is used , as it is required at low @xmath1  @xcite and has been recently advocated also for high @xmath1 reactions in ref .",
    "however , the higher energy of the outgoing proton requires a description which contains different elements than the conventional low @xmath1 analysis . for the electromagnetic current operator",
    "we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a relativistic current operator was used in a schrdinger - based calculation , avoiding any nonrelativistic reduction and including the effect of spinor distortion by the dirac scalar and vector potentials ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as for the final state",
    ", we employ a recently developed eikonal description of the final - state interaction ( fsi ) of the proton with the nucleus that has been tested against dwia solutions of a complex spin - dependent optical potential  @xcite .",
    "the absorption of the proton is described theoretically by linking it to the corresponding absorption of a nucleon propagating through nuclear matter .",
    "the relevant quantity is the nucleon self - energy which is obtained from a self - consistent calculation of nucleon spectral functions including the effects of realistic short - range and tensor correlations  @xcite .",
    "this description of fsi is combined with previous results for the bound - state wave functions of the @xmath5-shell quasihole states in @xmath10  @xcite , that have been deduced by solving the dyson equation with a nucleon self - energy containing the same short - range correlations but in a finite volume . in ref .",
    "@xcite these wave functions have been used to analyze low @xmath1 data for the @xmath2o(e , e@xmath0p ) reaction  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "these very same wave functions produce a good description of the shape of the coincidence cross section for the @xmath5-shell quasihole states at high @xmath1  @xcite using the same spectroscopic factors obtained from the low @xmath1 data  @xcite .",
    "a preliminary result was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a consistent analysis of low and high @xmath1 data requires an approach in which the same quasihole wave functions and corresponding spectroscopic factors are used in both cases .",
    "in this paper we present such an approach . in sec .",

    "in the one - photon exchange approximation , the differential cross section for the scattering of an ultrarelativistic electron with initial ( final ) momentum @xmath11 , off a nuclear target from which a nucleon is ejected with final momentum @xmath12 , reads  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the momentum and energy transferred to the target nucleus , respectively .",
    "the lepton tensor @xmath16 and hadron tensor @xmath17 are conveniently expressed in the basis of unit vectors @xmath18 which define the longitudinal ( 0 ) and transverse @xmath19 components of the nuclear response with respect to the polarization of the exchanged virtual photon .",

    "this complicated @xmath25-body problem can be simplified by projecting out of the hilbert space the specific channel that corresponds to the experimental asymptotic conditions of a knocked - out nucleon with momentum @xmath12 and of a residual nucleus , recoiling with momentum @xmath26 and mass @xmath27 , in a well - defined state @xmath28 with energy @xmath29 and quantum numbers @xmath30 .",

    "the norm of @xmath36 is 1 and @xmath39 is the spectroscopic factor associated with the removal process , i.e. it is the probability that the residual nucleus can indeed be conceived as the target nucleus with a hole .",
    "the dependence of @xmath37 upon @xmath40 is hidden in the asymptotic state @xmath24 and the boundary conditions are those of an incoming wave .    because of the complexity of the eigenvalue problem in the continuum , a complex mean - field interaction with energy - dependent parameters is usually assumed between the residual nucleus and the emitted nucleon .",
    "then , @xmath41 and the nonlocality of the original feshbach hamiltonian is taken into account by multiplying the scattering wave by the appropriate perey factor  @xcite .",
