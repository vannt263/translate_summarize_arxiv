    "the recent discovery of ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) such as @xmath1@xcite and @xmath0,@xcite and the intensive efforts to increase the ferromagnetic transition temperature in view of potential technological applications , has generated tremendous interest in the novel ferromagnetism exhibited by these systems in which magnetic interaction between localized spins is mediated by doped carriers.@xcite the nature of the ferromagnetic state has also attracted much attention , particularly in the context of competing antiferromagnetic ( af ) interaction which result in noncollinear ordering , spin - glass behaviour , and significant sensitivity of spin stiffness and transition temperature @xmath2 on carrier concentration , spin clustering etc .",
    "dms are mixed spin - fermion systems , involving randomly distributed localized magnetic impurities ( e.g. , mn@xmath3 , having @xmath4 ) and mobile carriers ( e.g. , holes ) in the semiconductor band . with carrier concentration @xmath5 much smaller than the magnetic impurity concentration @xmath6",
    ", the dms systems provide a complimentary limit to kondo systems .",
    "conventionally , the coupling between localized impurity spin @xmath7 and mobile valence band holes is represented by the exchange interaction @xmath8 , where @xmath9 \\psi$ ] is the fermion spin operator .",
    "cuprates form another class of strongly correlated systems in which the concentration of doped carriers is small in comparison to that of ( cu ) spins .",
    "extensively studied within the hubbard model , the dominant interaction in cuprates is the af exchange interaction between neighbouring cu spins , and af spin correlations persist even for small hole doping . against this strong tendency for af ordering , the delocalization energy gain of doped carriers , which favours parallel spin alignment , results in only a marginal twisting of spins , as in the proposed spiral phases.@xcite it is therefore interesting that elimination of the strong af spin interaction in a _ diluted _ hubbard model,@xcite with no direct hopping between relatively distant impurity spins , does indeed lead to a ferromagnetic state stabilized by carrier - induced spin couplings .",
    "the spin stiffness in the ferromagnetic state of the diluted hubbard model goes through a maximum with respect to both doping concentration @xmath5 and the interaction strength @xmath10 .",
    "this optimization behaviour can be qualitatively understood in terms of a competition between the increasing magnitude of carrier spin polarization @xmath11 and the increasing rapidity of its oscillation , which limits the growth of the spin coupling @xmath12 between two magnetic impurities at a fixed separation .",
    "similar behaviour was observed in the spin - fermion model for the effective ferromagnetic coupling @xmath13 in terms of the generalized spin response @xmath14 for finite @xmath15.@xcite as @xmath14 involves particle - hole processes , the spin couplings identically vanish in the absence of doping .",
    "however , in the diluted hubbard model , even with no carrier doping ( @xmath16 ) in the majority - spin band , particle - hole processes involving the empty minority - spin impurity band result in antiferromagnetic spin couplings , which destabilize the ferromagnetic state below a critical doping concentration .    in this paper , we study the novel ferromagnetic state of the diluted hubbard model for _ ordered _ impurity arrangements .",
    "we focus on magnon excitations and the spin stiffness , which provide quantitative measures of the stability and spin couplings in the ferromagnetic state , as well as the transition temperature in three dimensions . while preliminary real - space studies for both ordered and disordered impurity arrangements were carried out earlier on three - dimensional finite - size lattices,@xcite use of @xmath17-space representation in this paper allows for much larger lattices , thus permitting a more refined study of the competing spin interactions with respect to carrier concentration , impurity separation , interaction strength , and wave vector .",
    "indeed , the antiferromagnetic - ferromagnetic quantum phase transition stands out as a significantly prominent feature in the low doping regime .",
    "af - f and spin - glass transitions at low doping have actually been observed in mn - doped ii - vi semiconductors.@xcite with increasing doping concentration , an anomalous increase in the spin stiffness is observed which involves , as explained in section iii b , a subtle interplay of impurity moment reduction , impurity character of doped states , and competing particle - hole processes , all characteristics of the itinerant ferromagnetic state .    within the relatively simpler ferromagnetic kondo lattice model ( fklm ) ,",
    "in which a localized spin is present at every lattice site , magnon excitations have been studied recently , as a function of electron density @xmath18 in the conduction band and the spin - fermion coupling @xmath15 , in the context of heavy fermion materials,@xcite ferromagnetic metals gd , tb , dy , doped eux,@xcite and manganites.@xcite magnon dispersion has also been obtained in the context of dms.@xcite however , a uniform impurity - induced zeeman splitting of the carrier spin bands is assumed.@xcite    ) on a square host lattice ( @xmath19 ) . also shown are the sublattice labels corresponding to the four distinct sites within the unit cell . ]",

    "the energy - scale origin is set so that the host on - site energy is zero , and we take the impurity level to lie at the top of the host band ( @xmath26 in @xmath27 dimensions ) to optimize local - moment formation . for a positive sign of the hopping term",
    ", the top of the host band lies at @xmath28 , as in the valence band of dms . for simplicity",

    "do not connect the same sublattice in general , yielding a hermitian hamiltonian matrix with hopping terms @xmath53 etc .",
    "the case of impurity spacing 2 is , however , special as hopping terms in opposite directions do connect the same sublattice , yielding a real symmetric hamiltonian matrix .",

    "2 .      each magnetic impurity contributes two spin states .",
    "the minority - spin impurity state ( energy @xmath59 ) is pushed up by the local coulomb repulsion , and forms a split - off narrow impurity band due to the small overlap with neighbouring impurity states .",
    "the majority - spin impurity state ( energy @xmath60 ) mixes with the host band states for @xmath61 , and splits off on the low - energy side for large @xmath62 .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show a comparison of the quasiparticle density of states @xmath63 for two @xmath62 values for the 2-d and 3-d cases , showing the four and eight sub - bands corresponding to the sublattices , respectively .    for minority spin",
    ", while the impurity band shifts up with increasing @xmath62 and narrows due to decreasing effective impurity hopping @xmath64 , the host sub - bands remain unaffected reflecting strong host - impurity decoupling .",
    "the majority - spin sub - bands , however , are pulled down in energy by the exchange interaction , decreasing the energy separation between the two bands . with increasing @xmath62 , the impurity character of majority - spin states at the top of the band diminishes , as seen in fig .",

    "virtual hopping between impurity sites therefore generates antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath87 between neighbouring magnetic impurities , resulting in antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the carrier - mediated ferromagnetic couplings are absent , and the self - consistent ferromagnetic state is therefore unstable and actually represents a saddle point . the instability is reflected in a negative sign of the coefficient @xmath86 ( spin stiffness ) , which makes the transverse response eigenvalue @xmath88 and yields negative magnon energies [ fig .",
    "5(a ) ] . with hole doping ,",
    "ferromagnetic coupling strengthens , long - wavelength magnon - mode energy changes sign , and ferromagnetic ordering is stabilized at some critical hole concentration [ fig .",

    "5(b ) is the distinct behaviour of long- and short - wavelength magnon modes . even in the unstable regime , with negative - energy long - wavelength modes , the zone - edge modes @xmath89 may have positive energy , thereby giving a spurious indication of stability . incorporating only the zone - edge ( ising ) excitations ,",
    "the dynamical mean - field theory is therefore insensitive to the non - trivial long - wavelength behaviour arising from competing spin couplings .",
    "the long - wavelength magnon - mode energy @xmath79 and spin stiffness @xmath90 provide a composite measure of impurity spin couplings in the carrier - mediated ferromagnetic state .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show the behaviour of spin stiffness with doping concentration @xmath5 and interaction strength @xmath10 for the 2-d and 3-d cases with impurity spacing @xmath91 .",
    "a minimum hole concentration to stabilize the ferromagnetic state is clearly seen , especially for low @xmath10 , when the competing antiferromagnetic spin couplings are relatively stronger .",
    "the increase in spin stiffness with hole concentration exhibits the essence of carrier - mediated ferromagnetism .",
    "the initial increase is nearly linear in two dimensions and distinctly sublinear in three dimensions .",
    "the spin stiffness exhibits an optimization with respect to both @xmath5 and @xmath10 , which can be understood qualitatively within the generalized rkky theory in terms of a competition between increasing magnitude of carrier - spin polarization and increasing rapidity of its oscillation .",
    "similar behaviour of spin stiffness is seen ( fig .",
    "8) when impurity spacing is increased to 3 in the 2-d case .",
    "the peak spin stiffness is clearly reduced , reflecting the weakening of spin couplings with increased impurity separation .",
    "however , in the low doping regime , the spin stiffness for @xmath92 is actually greater than that for @xmath93 ( see inset ) .",
    "as the stiffness must eventually decrease with increasing impurity separation , this interestingly shows an optimization behaviour with respect to impurity concentration @xmath6 as well .    the anomalous increase at higher @xmath5 , seen in figs .",
    "6 - 8 for lower @xmath10 values , is due to a competition between two particle - hole processes , as discussed below .",

    "( 8) , labeled as 1 and 2 , which provide measures of the corresponding spin - stiffness contributions .",
    "positive ( negative ) value indicates dominant ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) spin coupling .",
    "process 2 , which is activated only upon doping in the majority - spin band , is seen to be dominantly ferromagnetic in the low - doping regime and exhibits the typical rkky peak behaviour before turning negative due to the oscillating carrier - spin polarization .",
    "however , process 1 , which is weakly antiferromagnetic for @xmath95 , changes sign with doping , and becomes increasingly ferromagnetic ; it is the sharp increase seen at higher doping which causes the distinct minimum feature in the total spin stiffness .",
    "this feature is more pronounced at lower @xmath10 because the sharply reduced impurity moment and @xmath62 at higher doping ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , cause the impurity states to be more extended , thus enhancing the process 1 stiffness .",
    "determination of the magnon spectrum in the carrier - mediated ferromagnetic state allows an estimation of the transition temperature @xmath2 for the diluted hubbard model in three dimensions .",
    "as the ferromagnetic state is characterized by small spin stiffness due to strong competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin couplings , the dominant contribution to reduction in magnetization is from the thermal excitation of long - wavelength magnon modes .",
    "therefore , the transition temperature @xmath2 can be estimated in terms of an equivalent heisenberg model with matching spin stiffness .    for a nearest - neighbour , spin-@xmath96 quantum heisenberg model with interaction energy @xmath15 on a cubic lattice ( coordination number @xmath97 ) , the magnon energy @xmath98 where @xmath99 , corresponding to the magnetic lattice spacing @xmath91",

    "the renormalized spin - fluctuation theory is somewhat lower than the mean - field value @xmath105 due to the spin - fluctuation factor @xmath106 , which is approximately 1.5 for the cubic lattice .",
    "extrapolating to spin-@xmath96 magnetic impurities in the diluted hubbard model , represented by multiple magnetic orbitals per site,@xcite with the same equivalent interaction energy @xmath107 as obtained above , the transition temperature reduces to the expression in eq .",

    "is the hf result obtained from a finite - temperature analysis of the self - consistency condition .",
    "the hf @xmath2 is naturally an order of magnitude higher as it really corresponds to a moment - melting temperature .    at the hf level",
    ", the impurity moment vanishes at a temperature @xmath109 , the minority - spin impurity - band energy relative to the fermi energy .",
    "the marginal increase seen in @xmath110 with doping is simply due to the decreasing fermi energy , whereas the impurity - band energy remains essentially unchanged .",
    "similar estimations of @xmath2 from magnon energy were recently carried out for the ferromagnetic kondo lattice model@xcite and in the context of dms,@xcite as a function of carrier concentration @xmath5 .",
    "optimization behaviour was found in these cases as well , with @xmath2 increasing with @xmath5 upto a maximum , followed by a monotonic decrease .",
    "carrier - induced ferromagnetism was investigated in the diluted hubbard model for ordered impurity arrangements .",
    "momentum - space representation within the sublattice basis permitted a detailed study with respect to carrier doping , impurity spacing , electron correlation , and wave vector .",
    "the delicate competition between spin couplings results in an af - f quantum phase transition in the low - doping regime .",
    "competition between the increasing magnitude and increasing rapidity of oscillation of the carrier - spin polarization was observed , yielding a characteristic optimization of the spin stiffness with doping concentration @xmath5 and interaction strength @xmath10 .",
    "surprisingly , in the low doping regime , the spin stiffness was found to actually increase when the impurity separation increased from 2 to 3 in the 2-d case , indicating an interesting optimization with respect to impurity concentration as well .",
    "in addition , the itinerant ferromagnetic state exhibits a subtle interplay of impurity moment reduction , impurity character of doped states , and competing particle - hole processes in the carrier - spin polarization , resulting in a distinct minimum and an anomalous increase in the spin stiffness at higher doping concentration .    for the cubic impurity arrangement ,",
    "doping dependence of the ferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath2 was calculated within the renormalized spin - fluctuation theory from the magnon spectrum , and compared with the hf result so as to highlight the difference between spin - ordering and moment - melting temperatures . for @xmath4 and a realistic heavy - hole bandwidth of 2 ev ,",
    "the peak calculated @xmath2 of 960 k at @xmath111 is in good agreement with the highest reported @xmath2 value of 940 k observed in @xmath0.@xcite    while our main objective was to examine the novel ferromagnetism in the diluted hubbard model , several features of this itinerant ferromagnetic state are of relevance to dms systems as well .",
    "for example , impurity bands formed by overlap of mn d orbitals are prominent features in density functional calculations within the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) , and a characteristic dependence of @xmath2 on mn concentration is obtained for impurity bands formed within the gap , as is the case for @xmath0.@xcite furthermore , correlation effects have also been examined recently within the lsda+u approach@xcite to obtain better agreement of the mn d - dos peak position with recent photoemission experiments .",
