    "since stars are observed to form in molecular clouds ( mcs ) , the properties of these stellar nurseries are expected to be closely tied to the processes of star formation .",
    "it has been a continuing goal of astrophysicists to thoroughly characterize the structure of mcs and to understand how this structure relates to protostellar collapse .",
    "the realization since at least the 1980s that mcs of similar masses can have drastically different rates of star formation gives further impetus to fulfilling this objective .",
    "the g216 - 2.5  molecular cloud and the rosette molecular cloud , as emblems of extreme contrasts in star formation activity , are good astrophysical laboratories for testing issues related to mc and star formation . also known as maddalena s cloud or the maddalena - thaddeus cloud ,",
    "g216 - 2.5  is noteworthy for its low temperature ( @xmath12 10 k ) , high mass ( @xmath13 ) , but low levels of star formation activity , compared to other mcs ( maddalena & thaddeus 1985 ) . in a series of papers in the 1990s , lee , snell & dickman ( 1991 ; 1994 ; 1996 ) mapped g216 - 2.5  in and and studied its infrared properties .",
    "lee et al .",
    "confirmed the earlier result of maddalena & thaddeus ( 1985 ) that the molecular cloud does not host massive star formation . through near - infrared imaging of point sources detected by the",
    "_ infrared astronomy satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) , they suggested that low - mass star formation is occurring primarily toward the boundaries of the cloud , and deduced that it is a remnant cloud that achieved its properties from past episodes of massive star formation .",
    "only recently were observations presented that indicate low - mass star formation is occurring in the main body of the cloud ( megeath et al .",
    "the rosette molecular cloud stands in stark contrast to g216 - 2.5 .",
    "the well - studied mc contains the ob association ngc 2244 whose stars excite the rosette nebula which , in turn , may be triggering star formation elsewhere in the cloud ( heyer et al .",
    "mid - infrared , near - infrared , and x - ray observations have revealed the presence of several embedded clusters within the rosette ( e.g. , phelps & lada 1997 ; romn - ziga et al .",
    "2008 ; ybarra et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "thus , the rosette and g216 - 2.5  represent two limits of star formation activity : on the one hand , the star formation rate ( sfr ) per unit mass in the rosette is higher than the galactic average ( williams & mckee 1997 ) , while g216 - 2.5  does not contain even one o star , as is expected for most galactic mcs of similar mass .",
    "does g216 - 2.5  have such low levels of star formation because it is very young ( a few myr ) and has only begun to form stars , as suggested by maddalena & thaddeus ( 1985 ) ? or is the mc in between episodes of massive star formation , as lee et al .",
    "( 1994 ) proposed ?",
    "the main disadvantage of the latter proposal is the lack of stars detected in g216 - 2.5 .",
    "a study of the atomic hydrogen ( @xmath14 ) gas associated with the cloud was more ambiguous in its conclusions about the cloud s evolutionary status ( williams & maddalena 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , the arguments that g216 - 2.5  is a relic of past star formation were made prior to the _ spitzer _ observations by megeath et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , which show there is an embedded population of young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the main body of the cloud .    in this and a following paper ,",
    "i take a fresh look at g216 - 2.5  to address the questions of the mc s evolutionary status and why it has such a low star formation activity . in light of new observations since the 1990s ,",
    "especially those of the _ herschel _ space observatory , as well as advances in numerical simulations of mc formation and evolution , a reexamination of this unusual molecular cloud is timely .",
    "this paper addresses the g216 - 2.5  mystery by comparing properties of its molecular gas  in particular , the column density distribution  with that of the well - studied rosette molecular cloud , which is considered to be representative of mcs harboring high - mass star formation . in ",
    "2 , i review previous results that are germane to this study . in  3 and  4 , i discuss the data and methods used in this study .",
    "the results , including column density maps and co - to-@xmath2  conversion maps , are presented in  5 .",
    "the key findings are further discussed in  6 and summarized  7 .",
    "in the 1990s , lee et al .",

    "( 1991 ) mapped g216 - 2.5  in the and @xmath15 transitions .",

    "lee et al . (",
    "1994 ) described how the large line widths , @xmath16 , might have resulted from prior star formation .",
    "their data indicate a complex velocity structure ( e.g. , shells and rings ) that could be the vestiges of past massive star formation activity .",
    "they estimated a mass of @xmath17 from observations and an assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) . to infer the total hydrogen column density",
    ", they derived a relation between and @xmath18 , which they measured from star counts . adopting a distance to g216 - 2.5  of 2.2 kpc and a diameter of 100.8 pc , lee et al .",
    "( 1994 ) determined a virial mass of @xmath19 .",
    "they suggested that the factor of 6 discrepancy between the two mass estimates could be explained if the cloud is not in virial equilibrium but , rather , is undergoing expansion .",
    "nevertheless , even by the lte mass estimate , g216 - 2.5  is more massive than many other nearby galactic , star - forming mcs ( e.g. , imara & blitz 2011 ) .",
    "lee et al . (",
    "1996 ) utilized infrared observations to infer the dust and low - mass star formation properties of g216 - 2.5 .",
    "they derived a correlation between dust and gas emission reminiscent of that observed in nearby dark clouds .",
    "they measured a far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity to molecular gas mass ratio of @xmath20 .",
    "this ratio , which is often used as a proxy for star formation efficiency , is close to @xmath21 for mcs in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , scoville & good 1989 ) and is @xmath22 for the rosette ( heyer et al . 2006 ) .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 1996 ) examined objects in the _ iras _ point source catalog in the vicinity of the cloud , and with follow - up near - infrared observations in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 bands , they identified four of the _ iras _ sources as possible sites of low - mass star formation ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "altogether , they estimated that 14 young stellar objects ( ysos ) are located at these sites .",
    "notably , none of these sources are located in the main body of the cloud .",
    "two are associated with satellite clouds to the north of the main mc , and the other two are located near the boundary of co emission . in this study , lee et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also pointed out that infrared emission in the north - east region of g216 - 2.5  is contaminated by emission from the more distant @xmath26  region s286 ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .        a little more than a decade passed before megeath et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found evidence of low - mass star formation within the main body of g216 - 2.5 .",
    "this group took observations with the _ spitzer _ telescope s infrared array camera ( irac ) and multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer_. using color - color selection criteria , they identified 74 ysos corresponding to a peak in emission located near @xmath27 , ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "they noted that the surface density distribution of ysos in g216 - 2.5  is similar to the distribution in taurus and much less than the surface density of ysos in orion a. curiously , g216 - 2.5  is roughly 10 times as massive as taurus .",
    "the remainder of this work will explore the molecular gas distribution of g216 - 2.5 , as revealed in rich detail by _ herschel_.",
    "i will derive and make detailed comparisons between the @xmath2  column density maps of the g216 - 2.5  and rosette mcs , in order to probe the evolutionary state of the former .",
    "i will also address the question of whether the co - to-@xmath2  conversion factor , the so - called @xmath28-factor , differs depending on local cloud conditions . while @xmath2  is the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium , it can not be observed directly at the cold temperatures of molecular clouds because it does not have a permanent dipole moment .",
    "therefore , alternative tracers of molecular gas must be used to infer the properties of molecular clouds .",
    "the second most abundant molecule , co , is commonly used , especially in external galaxies . to convert integrated co emission , @xmath1 , into @xmath2  column density , @xmath0",
    ", one can use the @xmath28-factor , @xmath29 bolatto et al .",
    "( 2013 ) discussed in detail the independent techniques employed to determine @xmath3 .",
    "one involves using tracers of column density , such as dust or optically thin molecular lines .",
    "historically , this was the first method used ( dickman 1975 ) and is justified since dust is observed to be well - integrated with gas ( e.g. , boulanger et al . 1996 ) and since the @xmath2  molecule forms most efficiently on dust grains .",
    "dickman ( 1975 ) observed the emission from 68 galactic clouds and compared this to optical extinction measurements . if a typically observed ratio of @xmath30 to @xmath31 is applied to those observations , this yields @xmath32 .",
    "the method used to derive @xmath3  in this analysis belongs to the same category as that initiated by dickman ( 1975 ) . in this case , however , dust far - infrared _ emission _ ( as opposed to dust _ extinction _ ) is used to trace the total hydrogen distribution . to convert from dust to total gas to @xmath2",
    "requires certain assumptions , including a gas - to - dust ratio ( see  [ sec : methods ] ) .",
    "another type of @xmath3  determination requires the potentially problematic assumption that mcs are in virial equilibrium , and the third compares co emission with @xmath33-ray emission produced by cosmic - ray interaction with @xmath2  molecules . while there is general accord among the different techniques to measure @xmath3 , variations in @xmath3",
    "have nevertheless been observed .",
    "bolatto et al .",
    "( 2013 ) propose a galactic conversion factor of @xmath34 with @xmath35 30% uncertainty , noting that departures from this value should be anticipated .",
    "dame et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that average value of @xmath3  in the solar neighborhood is @xmath36 and varies as a function of galactic latitude .",
    "the conversion factor has been found to vary in spatially resolved galactic mcs ( e.g. , pineda et al .",

    "it is one of the aims of this study to address the unsettled questions of how and what other environmental factors drive changes in @xmath3 .",

    "after testing different values of @xmath55 , i use a fixed value of @xmath56 and found this to be a valid choice , since it yields average mc column densities and total masses in agreement with independent methods of measuring these quantities .",

    "the predicted sfr in g216 - 2.5  is @xmath197 , about half the sfrs in ophiuchus and taurus , and consistent with the above estimates from equation [ eq : yso ] .",
    "if anything , the predicted value may _ slightly _ overestimate the sfr in g216 - 2.5 , however , due to the assumption that high - extinction material corresponds to @xmath195 @xmath196 . as clark & glover ( 2014 ) pointed out",
    ", the appearance of high - density gas at high extinctions does not necessarily mean high - extinction material is composed only of high - density gas . in their simulations of clouds of different masses ,",
    "clark & glover ( 2014 ) found that early on in a cloud s evolution , the quantity of gas above the volume density threshold can be less than the quantity of gas above the column density threshold by orders of magnitude .",
    "indeed , this may be the case in g216 - 2.5  if it is a young mc . as was shown in  [",
    "sec : distribution ] , g216 - 2.5  has a number of high - column - density regions with low number densities and with no evidence of star formation activity .",
    "this is in keeping with the williams & blitz ( 1998 ) study of clumps in g216 - 2.5  and the rosette in the co(3 - 2 ) , co(1 - 0 ) , and cs(2 - 1 ) lines .",
    "they found that @xmath198 of the clumps in the rosette are star - forming or incipient star - forming and @xmath199 are `` dormant '' ( i.e. , non - star - forming ) . in g216 - 2.5 , by comparison , nearly all the clumps are dormant .",
    "moreover , williams & blitz ( 1998 ) found that dormant clumps in the rosette tend to be denser and have steeper radial density profiles , suggesting that they are more evolved than dormant clumps in g216 - 2.5 .",
    "thus , as g216 - 2.5  as a whole ages , perhaps the number of gravitationally bound cores capable of forming stars will increase , as was the case for the clouds in the clark & glover ( 2014 ) simulations . with regards to the star formation history , with the data available here and the given assumptions , the estimates of the sfr in g216 - 2.5",
    "are within only a factor of 2 of each other .",
    "new observations in other regions of the cloud of deeply embedded sources may help to provide a more accurate measure of its star formation history .",
    "the idea that different regions within g216 - 2.5  may be evolving at different rates may also explain , in part , the regional differences in pdfs . from figure [ fig10 ] ,",
    "the following points are of note .",
    "first , the pdfs of star - forming regions display a power - law tail .",
    "but at least three regions in which star formation has not been detected ( 6 , 8 , and 9 ) also have pdfs with an excess of high column densities ( relative to log - normal ) , leading one to speculate that these regions might have deeply embedded sources or that star formation is incipient .",
    "second , there does not appear to be a characteristic width of pdfs of star - forming regions . while signatures of star formation activity have been identified in regions 1 , 2 , 5 , and 7 , the widths of pdfs of regions 1 and 7 are broader than those of 2 and 5 .",
    "moreover , the width of these latter two regions are also narrower than 3 , 6 , and 9 , in which star formation has yet to be detected .",
    "third , each of the star - forming regions have pdfs which peak at higher column densities than the pdf of the cloud as a whole .",
    "fourth , the pdfs of regions without detected star formation  regions 3 , 4 , and 6also peak at high column densities , relative to the peak of the entire cloud ( indicated by a dotted line in figure [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "fifth , in addition to possessing high - column density gas , regions with star formation contain a significant amount of low - column - density gas , to varying degrees depending on the region .",
    "the different sizes of the regions analyzed ( figure [ fig9 ] ) do not account for these regional differences , since the characteristics of the pdfs listed above are robust to variations in the boundary sizes .",
    "factors , such as turbulence , that may contribute to the regional differences will be explored in a future study .",
    "theoretical and observational studies suggest that , as a consequence of the gravitational collapse occurring on small scales within molecular clouds , the column density pdfs evolve .",
    "numerical simulations of molecular cloud evolution indicate that the pdf of a cloud acquires a power - law tail or `` wing '' at high extinctions and that this tail tends to flatten over time as the star formation efficiency increases ( e.g. , federrath & klessen 2013 ; clark & glover 2014 ; ward et al . 2014 ) . in their study of 23 galactic molecular clouds , kainulainen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that actively star - forming clouds have pdfs with non - log - normal tails at high - extinctions , while quiescent , non - star - forming clouds have log - normal pdfs over the entire range of column densities",
    ". figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show that both g216 - 2.5  and the rosette have high - extinction tails .",
    "interestingly , the slope of the g216 - 2.5  pdf is slightly flatter than that of the rosette , even when the range of values chosen for the fits are changed . taking this to suggest that g216 - 2.5  is more evolved than the rosette would be an over - interpretation , however , since it should be kept in mind that the slope of the high - extinction tail is probably not universal for clouds of similar age ( federrath & klessen 2013 ) . moreover",
    ", observational column density pdfs do not easily translate to volumetric pdfs , and as discussed above , high @xmath0 does not necessarily imply high @xmath200 . to better understand ( i ) the regional differences in pdfs discussed above , and",
    "( 2 ) how the properties of gas in g216 - 2.5  determine its sfr , high - resolution observations of molecular lines that trace high - density gas would be useful . with observations of @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and hcn , for instance , future work could focus on comparing cores in g216 - 2.5  with those in other mcs .    in the context of observational studies that aim to understand the nature of diffuse gas in molecular clouds ,",
    "the large excess over log - normal of low - column - density gas in g216 - 2.5  is interesting .",
    "previous studies that derived column density pdfs of mcs from extinction measurements are sometimes inconclusive about the origin of this low - extinction material ( e.g. , kainulainen et al .",
    "2009 ; lombardi et al .",
    "in particular , it can be difficult to ascertain whether low - extinction material is real ( i.e. , from the cloud of interest ) or if it is mostly contamination from foreground objects along the line of sight toward the cloud .",
    "the work presented here indicates that this low - extinction feature of the pdf persists when column densities are measured using dust emission measurements and , in the case of g216 - 2.5 , is likely to represent real structure .",
    "spatially , the low - density tail of the g216 - 2.5  pdf corresponds to low - density gas from within the cloud itself . in the pdf represented in figure [ fig4 ] , each column density is the excess above the boundary of the cloud , as defined by @xmath1  (  3 ) .",
    "thus , the low - column density tail of the pdf does not arise from the adjacent photodissociation region , discussed in williams & maddalena ( 1996 ) , which lies beyond the co boundary of the cloud . not including gas beyond this boundary also ensures that high - density features are not over - represented in the tail of the pdf .",
    "it is worth considering whether this low - density gas truly arises from within g216 - 2.5  itself , or is due to line of sight ( los ) contamination .",
    "one way to test for the latter possibility is to consider how much of a contribution the low - density gas makes to the total mass of g216 - 2.5 .",
    "for instance , gas having values to the left of the peak in the pdf in figure [ fig4 ] ( i.e. , @xmath203 ) contributes to 30% of the estimated total molecular mass . subtracting this contribution would result in an unrealistically low value for the total mass , so it is likely that this low - density material results from real dust emission within g216 - 2.5 .",
    "schneider et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , unlike this study , make a correction for los contamination toward g216 - 2.5 , which brings down their average column density before correction ; they consider only extinctions above @xmath204 mag . in this study ,",
    "the contribution of atomic gas to the total hydrogen column density is corrected for (  4 ) , which also has the effect of driving down the value derived here for the average column density , and values below @xmath205 mag are included in the analysis .",
    "ultimately , the combined effects of our different analyses result in schneider et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , deriving a higher value for the peak of the g216 - 2.5  pdf ( @xmath206 mag , after correction ) than that derived here .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the column density at which the pdf transitions from log - normal to the high - density power - law tail ( called tp in table 1 ) . in terms of visual extinction",
    ", this transition occurs at @xmath8 mag , in both clouds .",
    "kainulainen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) called this transition extinction @xmath207 and found that it occurs between 2  4 mag in most of the clouds from their 2009 study , in which they derived column densities from extinction maps using star counts .",
    "schneider et al .",
    "( 2014 ) derived column density pdfs for a sample of clouds , including g216 - 2.5 , from _ herschel _ dust emission maps . for g216 - 2.5",
    ", they found that @xmath208 mag ; and overall , for their group of four mcs , they found a higher range of transition extinctions occurring between 4  5 mag .    in their study of cluster formation in the rosette ,",
    "schneider et al . ( 2012 ) derived pdfs in six subregions of the cloud .",
    "they found that the pdf for the whole cloud has a log - normal distribution up to a visual extinction of @xmath209 mag and a power - law tail at high extinctions ( @xmath210  20 mag ) . in this study , the contribution of @xmath14  to the total gas column density is subtracted , thus , lower values of the pdf peak and the transition extinction are derived : @xmath211 mag ( equivalently , @xmath212 ; see table 1 ) .",
    "the essential point , nevertheless , is that the shape of the pdfs derived here  log - normal at low extinctions with power - law tails at higher extinctions  is consistent with previous studies , in spite of the different criteria for defining clouds .    taken together , the findings of this and previous studies give the impression that g216 - 2.5  is a `` young '' mc no more than a few million - years - old .",
    "hartmann et al .",
    "( 2001 ) noted that the stellar populations of most molecular clouds have age spreads of no more than 1  3 myr .",
    "this fact as well as the absence of older stars favor mcs being transient entities that live no more than @xmath213 myr ( e.g. , blitz & shu 1980 ) .",
    "hartmann et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue for a picture in which star formation and mc formation are triggered by the same large - scale flow of distant star - forming sites .",
    "outflows from high - mass stars ultimately disperse the cloud of which they formed ; but it is an open question as to whether low - mass stars can similarly disperse their parent cloud on short timescales .",
    "this line of reasoning is not necessarily at odds with the argument of lee et al .",
    "( 1994 ) that g216 - 2.5  is a remnant cloud from past massive star formation .",
    "one need only ( re)consider the term `` remnant '' and its connotation of oldness . if mcs form at the interface of large - scale flows , as some simulations suggest ( e.g. , hartmann et al .",
    "2001 ; hennebelle et al .",
    "2008 ) , then new clouds naturally condense from the `` remnants '' of old clouds .",
    "future work related to this study will examine the dynamics of g216 - 2.5  and of the atomic gas associated with it .",
    "williams & maddalena ( 1996 ) already showed that g216 - 2.5  appears to be connected to s287 , a distant star - forming region , by an @xmath14  cloud . and lee et al .",
    "( 1994 ) established that g216 - 2.5  has a global velocity gradient that could be explained if the mc is part of a large , expanding shell .",
    "another interpretation , however , is that the gradient is due to shear ( if , for instance , the cloud formed at the interface of converging flows ) .",
    "considered together , this could mean g216 - 2.5  recently merged from large - scale flows and has not had enough time to build up the @xmath14  necessary to shield @xmath2  and co from dissociating uv radiation as effectively as older mcs .",
    "this is not a firm conclusion , nevertheless , and so subsequent work will concentrate on understanding the large scale surroundings of g216 - 2.5 .",
    "although evidence for differing sfrs in mcs is not new , g216 - 2.5  still seems to be exceptional , considering the peculiar combination of its properties : ( 1 ) it has a total mass comparable to the most massive mcs ( e.g. , california , orion b ) ; ( 2 ) its total dense mass is comparable to medium - sized mcs with hundreds of ysos ( e.g. , taurus , ophiuchus ) ; and yet ( 3 ) it forms stars at a rate similar to low - mass clouds ( e.g. , lupus ) . in this work ,",

    "<S> the pdfs of both clouds are log - normal for extinctions below @xmath8 mag and both show departures from log - normality at high extinctions . although it is the less - massive cloud , the rosette has a higher fraction of its mass in the form of dense gas and contains @xmath9 of gas above the so - called extinction threshold for star formation , @xmath10 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the g216 - 2.5  cloud has @xmath11 of dense gas above this threshold . </S>"
