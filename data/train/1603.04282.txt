    "actinides play an important role in astrophysics in different ways .",
    "first , the use of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 to estimate astrophysical ages has a long history , a milestone of which is the much celebrated piece of work of @xcite . for long , the field of nucleo - cosmochronology that emerged from this paper has been aiming at the determination of the age @xmath8 of the nuclides from abundances in the material making up the bulk of the solar system .",
    "the astrophysical importance of th and u was enhanced further with the observation of th and u in some very metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "these measurements raised the hope of a possible nuclear - based evaluation of the age of individual stars other than the sun .",
    "additional recent observational advances have triggered substantial interest in other actinides that are shorter - lived than th and u. this comes about following the measurement of the galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) abundances of the @xmath9 elements , including the actinides , with unprecedented resolution , using the trek detector @xcite .",
    "further significant progress is expected by the determination of the gcr abundances of the actinides th , u , pu and cm both relative to each other and relative to the pt - group of elements .",
    "precise abundance measurements of this type would yield an estimate of the time elapsed between the nucleosynthesis of the gcr actinides and their acceleration to gcr energies ( the gcr actinide propagation time after acceleration is very short , i.e of the order of 2 my ) .",
    "hence , they would help determining whether gcrs were accelerated out of fresh ejecta of the astrophysical r - element sources ( supernovae or neutron - star mergers ) , superbubble material , or old , well - mixed galactic material .    also attempts to measure the @xmath3pu content of the local interstellar medium should be mentioned here .",
    "such measurements may allow for conclusions on the frequency of the astrophysical events producing actinides . at present",
    ", this can be done through the analysis of dust grains of identified interstellar origin recovered in deep - sea reservoirs ( sediments and femn crusts ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by the recovery of @xmath10fe incorporated in fossil biogenic samples @xcite .",
    "marine sediments were also analysed for a @xmath3pu signal associated with measurements of @xmath10fe in a ferromanganese crust @xcite , which has been interpreted as product of a supernova close to the solar system about 2.2my ago @xcite .    for all these reasons ,",
    "there is an obvious need to provide detailed theoretical estimates of the possible stellar production of actinides with half - lives in excess of typically @xmath11  y. most importantly , the uncertainties in these predicted abundances should be evaluated as well . while the actinides are clearly produced by the rapid neutron - capture process ( or r - process ) of stellar nucleosynthesis , the site(s ) of this nucleosynthesis process",
    "have not been unambiguously identified yet @xcite .",
    "two possible astrophysical sites of r - process production are discussed : supernovae and neutron - star mergers . in the case of supernova explosions a variety of scenarios for r - element creation by primary and secondary processes",
    "were proposed .",
    "neutron - rich jets in rare , magnetohydrodynamic explosions of rapidly rotating stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and neutron production by neutrino reactions in the helium layer of compact , metal - poor exploding stars @xcite were considered as being potentially responsible for an early enrichment of the young galaxy with r - process matter .",
    "however , supernovae could be a major or even dominant source of r - process elements only if the so - called neutrino - driven wind , a low - mass baryonic outflow from newly formed neutron stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , were able to provide an r - process viable environment @xcite .",
    "self - consistent models , however , do not only yield wind entropies that are too low to enable a strong r - process that could make lanthanides and actinides ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but state - of - the - art supernova models with high - fidelity neutrino transport also yield proton - rich conditions instead of neutron excess in the wind ejecta @xcite .    recently , growing attention has been paid to mergers of binary neutron stars ( ns - ns ) and neutron star - black hole ( ns - bh ) systems as possible r - process sites @xcite , following the confirmation by hydrodynamic simulations that non - negligible amounts of matter , typically about @xmath12 to several @xmath13@xmath14 , can be ejected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to the supernova case , investigations with growing sophistication have so far supported ns merger ejecta as viable sites for strong r - processing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for steps towards including neutrino effects ) .",
    "in particular , comprehensive nucleosynthesis calculations @xcite show that the combined contributions from both the dynamical ( prompt ) ejecta expelled during ns - ns or ns - bh mergers , and the neutrino and viscously driven outflows generated during the post - merger remnant evolution of relic nss or bh - torus systems can lead to the production of r - process elements from @xmath15 up to thorium and uranium with an abundance distribution that reproduces extremely well the solar distribution , as well as the elemental distribution observed in low - metallicity stars @xcite .",
    "despite a roughly 1000 times lower ns merger rate compared to the core - collapse supernova rate , ns - ns / bh mergers could still explain the total amount of r - material in the galaxy because the amount of ejected r - process - rich matter per ns merger is roughly 1000 times higher than the potential contribution from the neutrino - driven wind of a supernova .",
    "based on observed binary pulsars and population synthesis calculations , the ns - ns merger rate is currently estimated to be within the plausible range of 3 to 190  myr@xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "initially there were concerns that the low rate of compact star mergers ( with their correspondingly larger ejecta masses per event ) in addition to the long time delay of binary mergers after the preceding , iron - producing supernovae would be incompatible with the galactic enrichment history as deduced from observations of ( ultra-)metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "however , more recent models of the chemical evolution of the milky way show a much more promising situation . taking into account a short - lived binary component ( with inspiral times of less than 100  myr ) , incomplete galactic mixing and/or the sub - halo merger history of the milky way",
    ", these new studies conclude that double compact star mergers might indeed be the major producers of r - process elements and might even be responsible for the enrichment of metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "although these investigations , which are based on largely different modeling approaches , ranging from traditional , highly simplified box models to hydrodynamical simulations , do not agree in all quantitative details of the picture , the majority of them suggests that compact binary mergers as r - process sites are better compatible with the considerable event - to - event scatter of the r - process abundances in metal - poor stars .    if ns - ns / bh mergers are indeed the main cosmic sources of heavy r - process matter , the rarity of such events would leave little hope for discovering on earth larger amounts of radioisotopes of cosmic origin like @xmath3pu .",
    "in fact , a recent measurement found a very low @xmath3pu abundance in deep - ocean reservoirs , about two orders of magnitude lower than expected from continuous production by frequent sources like supernovae  @xcite . in combination with abundance measurements for the early solar system this experimental result was therefore interpreted as strong evidence for the origin of @xmath3pu from compact binary mergers @xcite .    however , more experimental and observational confirmation with better statistics and based on alternative reservoirs is highly desirable to consolidate the picture suggested by the existing measurements , which are subject to considerable uncertainties associated with limited statistics and our incomplete knowledge of the probability with which supernova - made nuclei make their way to earth and finally end up in the investigated sample material .",
    "such caveats certainly justify ongoing efforts to directly identify supernovae as cosmic sources of r - process matter or , alternatively , to derive increasingly stronger bounds to the supernova origin of this matter by searching for r - nuclei in the envelopes of supernova companion stars and for radioisotopes in dated terrestrial sediments .",
    "it should be kept in mind that without any unambiguous identification of an r - process source by the in - situ detection of r - nuclei our understanding of the astrophysical origin of this nucleosynthetic component is based on complex indirect arguments and on theoretical models with their natural limitations .",
    "such limitations are associated with numerous simplifications that still enter the modeling of supernovae as well as compact binary mergers , with constraints set by the finite numerical resolution and by the omission of physics that could play a role like , for example , acoustic waves due to ns vibration  @xcite , fallback in supernovae and associated re - ejection of matter @xcite , strong neutron - star magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a rigorous treatment of neutrino oscillations , or non - standard weak - interaction physics .    with the goal to assist future experimental searches we provide here state - of - the - art estimates of the possible production of the actinides .",
    "in order to circumvent the uncertainties of current core - collapse supernova and neutrino - wind models , we adopt an optimistic point of view here and assume that the r - process taking place in type - ii supernovae is capable of producing elements up to the heaviest actinides and in addition that each such event leads to an r - abundance distribution similar to the one found in the solar system . the striking similarity between the solar distribution of r - element abundances in the @xmath17 range and the corresponding abundance pattern observed in ultra - metal - poor stars like",
    "cs 22892 - 052 @xcite led to the conclusion that every astrophysical event producing r - elements gives rise to a solar system - like r - abundance distribution , at least for elements above ba .",
    "such observations therefore tend to lend support to our assumption , although recent observations also indicate that star - to - star variations in the r - process content of metal - poor globular clusters may be a common , although not ubiquitous , phenomenon @xcite .",

    "several wind models of analytical or semi - analytical nature exist . they differ in their level of physical sophistication and in their way to parametrize the wind characteristics . in all cases",
    ", the wind is assumed to be spherically symmetric , which appears to be a reasonable first approximation even in two - dimensional simulations , at least at late enough times after core bounce @xcite .",
    "in addition , the wind is generally treated as a stationary flow , meaning no explicit time dependence of any physical quantity at a given radial position @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 , let @xmath21 be the velocity , temperature , density , internal energy , pressure , entropy , or composition .",
    "the validity of this approximation is discussed in @xcite , where it is concluded that stationarity may be reasonably assured , even if some caution is warranted .",
    "newtonian , post - newtonian , and relativistic descriptions of spherically symmetric , stationary neutrino - driven winds originating from the surface of proto - neutron stars ( pns ) have been developed along the lines of a long experience with previous mathematical treatments of the solar wind and of accretion flows onto black holes .",
    "the wind model adopted here corresponds to the analytical newtonian , adiabatic and steady - state wind model , referred to in the following as nass , derived by @xcite .",
    "it provides a simple , fully analytical description of the dynamics of the wind outflow at relatively late times or sufficiently far away from the pns surface .",
    "the nass wind model relies on the general assumptions listed above , in particular those of a newtonian pns gravitational potential and of an adiabatic expansion .",
    "in addition , all the elementary @xmath22 and e@xmath23/e@xmath24 weak interaction processes are assumed to be frozen out , nuclear @xmath25-decays not to affect @xmath26 or @xmath27 , and possible deviations from nuclear equilibrium with regard to strong and electromagnetic interactions to have no influence on the thermodynamical properties of the wind . under such simplifying assumptions",
    ", the nass model can not predict any time variations of the entropy @xmath27 , electron fraction @xmath28 , or of the wind mass loss rate @xmath29 , which are thus treated as constant input parameters .",
    "the basic nass wind dynamics in the regime under consideration , and in particular for high enough entropies , is well approximated @xcite by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pns mass , @xmath19 the radius , @xmath32 the velocity , @xmath33 the temperature . the total energy per unit mass @xmath34 may be obtained by setting a boundary condition and is usually expressed as a function of the wind energy : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 equals the local adiabatic sound speed @xcite . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the solutions correspond to a sonic wind , whereas for @xmath39 they are of subsonic wind type and usually referred to as breeze solutions .",

    "is followed by starting at a temperature of @xmath47 , the total entropy is essentially equal to the radiation entropy ( within a few percents ) . note that the ` radiation entropy ' is measured here per baryon in units of the boltzmann constant @xmath48 and includes both the photon and lepton contributions , but not the baryonic ones . for the initial conditions adopted here , the latter amounts to typically 9  @xmath48/baryon .    in the wind model of @xcite , the radial evolution of the velocity , @xmath49 , and density , @xmath50 , for specified total energy ( @xmath34 ) per unit mass of outflow material ( or , equivalent , for given @xmath51 ) , given entropy and given mass - loss rate ( @xmath52 ) is determined by the energy equation ( based on bernoulli s equation , see eq .",
    "[ eq : wind_motion ] ) and the continuity equation @xmath53 .",
    "the temperature then follows from the assumption of constant entropy , which couples temperature and density .",
    "varying @xmath51 ( or @xmath34 ) , @xmath54 or @xmath55 therefore also implies different values of the expansion time scale .",
    "within the nass wind model , the velocity at small radii ( and high temperatures ) is found to vary as @xmath56 and consequently significantly increases with the radiative entropy for given @xmath55 and @xmath51 .",
    "the nass equations describe the outflow dynamics ( wind and breeze solutions ) as functions of radius and as determined by @xmath55 , @xmath34 ( or , equivalent , @xmath51 ) , and @xmath54 .",
    "these parameters as well as the electron fraction , @xmath57 , are considered to be independent of each other , which implies that the nass model does not invoke any physical mechanism by which these characteristic parameters of the flow are coupled . in reality , the physical processes that drive the mass outflow from the pns surface will determine the values of these quantities and may lead to relations between them .",
    "the nass model therefore provides a more general description of outflows from new - born nss than , e.g. , the usual neutrino - driven wind models mentioned above , where neutrino heating near the pns surface sets the conditions in the ejecta .",
    "this more general modeling approach is an advantage and requirement of our study , which intends to explore also the uncertainty limits of predictions of actinide nucleosynthesis associated with still unsettled aspects of the wind physics ( like , e.g. , the impact of acoustic waves from ns vibrations or strong magnetic fields ) .",
    "because of this freedom of the nass model , however , we have to define suitable ranges of the parameters of the model , which allow us to scan the range of possibilities .",
    "naturally , this can happen only by the investigation of a limited number of cases , which we define as `` ranges i  iv '' .",
    "the four ranges of outflow conditions considered in the present study are defined as follows , aiming at a good reproduction of the solar r - process abundances from the first to the third abundance peak . in range",

    "this restricted set of 40 trajectories will be shown in sect .",

    "the astrophysical conditions thus considered are associated with a wide range of expansion time scales @xmath65 . if we define @xmath65 as the time required for the temperature to drop from @xmath47 to @xmath66 , @xmath65 ranges between 120 and 950  ms for an entropy of @xmath67 and between 18 and 30  ms for @xmath68 at conditions of range  i. in range ii ( iii ) , @xmath69 ( 31 )  ms for the largest entropies of @xmath70 , but increases up to 7.3 ( 7.2 )  s for @xmath71 .",
    "in contrast to the usual behavior of neutrino - driven winds , where higher entropies are associated with increasing expansion time scales @xcite , the conditions defined by ranges i  iii exhibit inverse relations , namely greater entropies for shorter expansion time scales .",
    "this appeals to some unknown mechanism that can provide such conditions ( which is not implausible in view of the fact that ordinary neutrino - driven winds are not found to produce heavy r - process material ) .",
    "the standard behavior of neutrino - driven winds can be reproduced by our nass model by making use of the relation @xmath72 and by modifying the outflow rate such that the effect of higher entropies on the wind velocity is compensated . in order to study a case",
    "more compatible with neutrino - driven winds and breezes , we therefore consider an additional set of breeze solutions , range  iv , with the following entropies @xmath73 and outflow rates @xmath55 ( in @xmath74s ) : ( 100 , 0.6 ) , ( 125 , 0.17 ) , ( 150 , 0.06 ) , ( 175 , 0.015 ) , and ( 200 , 0.006 ) . with @xmath62 ,",

    "we derived updated estimates of the production of the radioactive actinides of @xmath0th , @xmath1u , @xmath2np , @xmath3pu , and @xmath4 cm and of the corresponding uncertainty ranges based on the assumption that the neutrino - driven wind of the proto - neutron star in core collapse supernovae is able to provide r - process viable conditions and can well reproduce the universal r - process abundance pattern observed in the sun and found in metal - poor stars .",
    "since current state - of - the - art hydrodynamical models of supernova explosions and of the neutrino - driven wind do not yield the dynamic and thermodynamic conditions needed for the production of heavy r - process material , we base our study on the simple , analytical nass ( newtonian , adiabatic , steady - state ) wind model and take into account the mass - weighted superposition of a large number of wind components with different nucleosynthesis - relevant characteristics of entropy , expansion time scale , and neutron excess .",
    "the set of chosen conditions is constrained by the ability of the integrated wind material to match the solar r - abundance distribution . in order to explore the sensitivity of our estimates for the actinide production to uncertain nuclear physics",
    ", we tested the influence of six different sets of nuclear - rate ingredients .",
    "the consideration of neutrino - driven winds of supernovae as possible r - process site , despite the unfavorable conditions provided by current hydrodynamical models , and the combination of wind components under the mentioned constraint , can be justified by the fact that also the state - of - the - art models still suffer from major uncertainties , e.g.  with respect to neutrino opacities in correlated nuclear matter , the effects of potentially strong magnetic fields inside and around the nascent ns , or the incomplete exploration of neutrino - oscillation effects and possible non - standard weak interaction physics in the pns environment . on the other hand , despite considerable modeling progress and generally more promising properties of the ejecta dynamics , also ns - ns and/or ns - bh mergers are by far not established as the main sources of heavy r - process nuclei , because in this case too , major uncertainties still affect the weak - interaction sector as well as the description of strong magnetic field effects .",
    "further observational efforts for a positive confirmation of the one or the other or of both possible sources are therefore needed .",
    "this includes searches of electromagnetic transients associated with the radiation emission of ns - ns / bh merger ejecta heated by the radioactive decay of r - process nuclei ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the exploration of cosmic and terrestrial reservoirs for signatures of freshly produced r - nuclei . our work is intended to facilitate the observational and experimental analyses of the latter kind and their interpretation .",
    "we find a considerable spread of the results of actinide yields with the largest uncertainty ( a factor of @xmath105100 ) for @xmath0th and the lowest uncertainty for @xmath3pu ( factor of @xmath10512 ) and for @xmath4 cm ( factor of @xmath1057 ) , with supersonically expanding wind solutions producing considerably less actinide material than more slowly , subsonically expanding breeze outflows . for investigations of terrestrial material",
    "like recently performed by @xcite , it is interesting to know the isotope - production ratio of @xmath3pu compared to the long - lived radioactive nucleus @xmath10fe .",
    "current supernova models predict a yield of @xmath10fe of @xmath106 per massive - star death or @xmath107 per supernova @xcite .",
    "since this theoretical value seems to exceed estimates based on cosmic - rays near the earth by about a factor of 2 @xcite , we consider here a @xmath10fe output per exploding massive star of @xmath108 . with this number",
    "we obtain a theoretical range for the supernova - produced @xmath3pu/@xmath10fe isotope ratio between roughly @xmath109 and @xmath110 , using the yields of table  [ tab2 ] . with experimentally determined limits of less than @xmath111 for their crust and sediment samples",
    ", @xcite set a bound still more than a factor of 10 below our lower limit .",
    "therefore this bound seems to exclude a recent insemination of the earth by r - process material from a frequent source like supernovae , in particular from a nearby supernova @xmath1052.2my in the past",
    ". however , the exclusion may not be as convincing as suggested by the two orders of magnitude discrepancy advocated by @xcite .",
    "not only the probability with which @xmath3pu from a possible supernova origin ends up in the investigated material samples is uncertain , also the extreme sensitivity of the actinide production to the model variations tested in our work should be taken as a warning .",
