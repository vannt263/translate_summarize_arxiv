    "as with the seti null results , the interpretation of even this trivial positive result is disputed .",
    "the debate frequently centers around two principles : the anthropic principle and the copernican principle .",
    "the anthropic principle essentially says that our existence or situation is somehow inevitable , regardless of how special or improbable we are @xcite .",
    "the most commonly invoked version is the weak anthropic principle , which applies if the universe is very large .",
    "the weak anthropic principle can be formulated in terms of observations , as a statement about inference : we can not deduce the probability of our evolution just from our existence .",
    "our situation could be very special ( but not unique ) and still be consistent with observation .",
    "in statistical terms , as long as the probability of intelligent life evolving is nonzero , the likelihood of it existing in an infinite universe is 1 .",
    "the inferential weak anthropic principle is also interpreted as a statement about selection bias @xcite .",
    "the weak anthropic principle can also be stated in in terms of theoretical predictions , as a statement about causality : in a sufficiently big universe , the appearance of humanity somewhere is to be expected , even if the probability of that happening in a particular location is very low but non - zero .",
    "the conditions necessary for our evolution may just be one of the special , rare events that occasionally happen in an infinite universe .",
    "there are stronger versions of the anthropic principle , which apply not just to the contingent circumstances within the universe , but to the fundamental laws of physics themselves @xcite .",
    "the most extreme formulations argue that conscious observers or humanity play some crucial role in the functioning of the universe .",
    "these versions imply that the universe is actually compelled to produce us , and it would be logically impossible for the universe to exist without us @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the causal weak anthropic principle , in which the probability of our not existing in an infinite universe has measure @xmath15 ; the impossibility in the weak case is merely statistical rather than logical .",
    "as such , stronger anthropic principles say that humanity is truly special in terms of function or role , not just in terms of being rare , and they are far more controversial .    in tension with the anthropic arguments",
    "is the copernican principle .",
    "the fundamental argument of the copernican principle is that we are not in a special location of the universe , as demonstrated by centuries of astronomical observation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "more generally , we should assume that our circumstances are not special ( as in its controversial application by @xcite ) .",
    "as far as we can observe , the earth , solar system , and galaxy are fairly typical in astrophysical terms ; other bodies like them should be common throughout the universe .",
    "after all , they are the result of natural processes that could occur anywhere .",
    "the copernican principle is related to the principle of mediocrity : in the absence of information , we are more likely to find ourselves in a typical situation than a rare one ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even if the evolution of intelligent life is extremely rare , we can still hold to a weaker argument that i will call the weak copernican principle .",
    "the weak copernican principle states that our evolution is the result of physical processes that have a non - zero probability of occurring independently elsewhere in the universe .",
    "if one accepts a naturalistic view of evolution , this may seem trivial , but it is not .",
    "it is logically possible for a class of events to have probability measure @xmath15 : for example , one could flip a fair coin infinitely many times and get only heads .",
    "the weak copernican principle is also technically distinct from the causal weak anthropic principle , even if they both imply our existence is expected in a large enough universe .",
    "the weak copernican principle implies the evolution of intelligence at a suitably distant location is independent of our evolution .",
    "in contrast , one could imagine that the evolution of intelligence on one planet somehow makes it impossible for it to evolve anywhere else in the universe .",
    "for example , the universe might be a computer simulation which is designed to randomly place life on one and only one planet .",
    "this could still be consistent with the weak anthropic principle , as long as the probability of life appearing the first time is large enough .",
    "on the other hand , the weak copernican principle does nt say that our evolution is inevitable ; it still applies if the chance that life evolves around a star is @xmath10 and there are only @xmath16 stars in the universe .    in some sense",
    ", it is clear that both the anthropic and copernican arguments are partly true .",
    "the weak anthropic principle is true in that most of the universe s volume is not filled with intelligent life forms , even if every planet is habitable . for that matter , the other planets in our solar system and the sun are unfit for human habitation ; this was not clear a few centuries ago @xcite .",
    "the copernican principle is true in that there are planets besides the earth , and solar systems besides our own .",
    "just a few decades ago , it was an open question if exoplanets existed at all or if the solar system was the result of an improbable stellar event @xcite , and the existence of other planets was also unclear a few centuries ago .",
    "now the problem is to figure out how to extrapolate these principles beyond the evolution of stars and planets to the evolution of life and intelligence .",
    "the philosophical debate about the existence of aliens can be understood as a debate about priors . in bayesian probability theory ,",
    "a prior is a subjective judgment about how much one believes in a hypothesis before an observational test is done . given a continuously varying parameter @xmath17 , the prior @xmath18 takes the form of a probability distribution function ( pdf ) over the allowed values of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "when new evidence arrives , bayes theorem describes how the prior can be transformed into a posterior describing subjective levels of belief after considering evidence from an observation @xcite : @xmath19 bayes theorem requires the likelihood @xmath20 , which is the probability that one would make a given observation if the hypothesis is true .",
    "the likelihood can frequently be estimated theoretically for a well - characterized model and a well - understood experiment .",
    "in addition , bayes theorem requires an evidence factor @xmath21 , which is a normalizing factor .",
    "it basically is the probability that one would make an observation according to a prior , including the cases where the hypothesis is true and where the hypothesis is false . for the continuous parameter @xmath17 ,",
    "bayes theorem is phrased as @xmath22    although the choice of prior is subjective , the principle of mediocrity is a general guiding principle .",
    "it says that , in the absence of evidence , we should assume that no particular value is special , and therefore we should favor no value over another @xcite .",
    "otherwise , if all of the prior weight is concentrated into a few hypotheses , we effectively assume whichever hypothesis we wish to prove .",
    "then even if evidence strongly points towards an alternate hypothesis , we essentially ignore it and cling to the old theory ( for example , the `` presumptuous philosopher '' thought experiment recounted in @xcite ) . for a continuous parameter ,",
    "the prior should not be too strongly weighted towards one value , which is fulfilled if it is flat .",
    "note that a flat prior for a parameter @xmath17 does not remain flat if the variable @xmath17 is transformed , such as if we then consider @xmath23 . if @xmath17 might have values that vary over orders of magnitude , a logarithmic prior that is uniform in @xmath23 ( flat log prior ) seems like a reasonable choice , since it has no scale .",

    "different conclusions are reached if different facts of our evolution are emphasized as representative .",
    "the timescales for our evolution is a common source of speculative reasoning .",
    "the idea is that a habitable planet has some unchanging chance of producing intelligent life in a unit of time , @xmath24 .",
    "this is appropriate if the appearance of intelligence depends on a process that is independent of history , like an evolutionary process generating certain key traits through a random walk @xcite .",
    "life appeared quite early in our planet s history , which would not be typical if life arose through such random processes ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "@xcite interprets this observation as evidence that life arises quickly on planets and is common ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but others argue that intelligence can only arise if life appears early and this atypicality could be an anthropic bias @xcite .",
    "the choice of a prior on @xmath26 also affects whether meaningful constraints are then set on @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "@xcite applies an analogous argument on cosmological scales , arguing for a large @xmath24 large because the earth formed before most of the universe s virialized gas had a chance to collapse into planets .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite noted that the timescale for humanity s evolution is close to the habitable lifespan of the earth .",
    "he essentially interprets this observation according to a flat log prior in the evolutionary timescale .",
    "of all the many orders of magnitude this timescale could have been , it is unlikely to have matched the earth s lifespan so closely , so he interprets the coincidence as the result of anthropic selection ; the expected timescale is much longer , and intelligent life is very rare .",
    "furthermore , using a simple model of evolution , he argues that the timing is related to the number of unlikely steps that occurred along the way of our evolution ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "but this argument too has been disputed ; @xcite argues that astrophysical extinction events like gamma ray bursts can slow down the actual time it takes for intelligent life to evolve even if the unimpeded timescale is fairly short .",
    "it s also possible that a critical evolutionary step is directly tied to the sun s properties @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggests the critical step is the development of an ozone layer , which is related to the photodissociation of atmospheric water vapor into oxygen ; this process is only efficient for blue stars no more long - lived than the sun .",
    "it s also possible that the evolution timescale is not the relevant factor , because the evolution of life is constrained by earlier arbitrary events .",
    "for example , it is unlikely that a life form will greatly change the genetic code mapping amino acids to dna nucleotide sequences ; the cost is too great as it risks turning all of the genes into gibberish @xcite . but this code was set very early in the development of life . if the appearance of intelligence depended on having a particular genetic code ( compare with * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then whether it evolves on a particular planet could have little to do with the time available .    by itself",
    ", this would nt explain the coincidence between the sun s lifetime and the time for humanity to evolve , but one could imagine that events very early in life s evolution launches it on a nearly fixed course that predetermines whether and how long until intelligence appears .",
    "if there s a small chance that this trajectory leads to intelligence appearing in 10 gyr , a much smaller chance that intelligence appears in 1 gyr , a much smaller chance that it appears in 100 myr , and so on , most intelligence would appear near the end of their planet s lifespan , without depending on the presence of discrete evolutionary barriers along the way .    in a recent book ,",
    "@xcite presented a relatively simple argument that suggests that we are alone .",
    "the probability that intelligent life @xmath0 arises on a given planet is unknown , even at an order of magnitude level , so we can adopt a prior that is uniform in @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath27 is between @xmath28 and @xmath15 , then we are not alone .",
    "but we have no reason to set @xmath28 as a lower limit ; given our ignorance , it could easily extend to @xmath29 or further .",
    "because of the huge range in @xmath27 allowed by our ignorance , relatively little weight is left to be spread over the range of @xmath30 , so this reasonable prior indicates that we are likely alone in the observable universe @xcite .",
    "is given as the motivation .",
    "the fundamental quantity is the probability that intelligence evolves on a world , and the number of worlds tracks comoving volume .",
    "the logarithm of the comoving distance is not proportional to the logarithm of the comoving distance if space is slightly curved .",
    "second , @xcite applies the fermi paradox ( described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to rule out @xmath31 , closing the window for which aliens could exist in the observable universe .",
    "but systematic uncertainties can blunt null results , and the prior weight in this window could be so low for the log prior that applying the fermi paradox has insignificant value . ]    but this argument has a problem  the lower bound is left undefined , which can lead to strange results .",
    "fundamental physics implies that there are at most @xmath32 configurations for the observable universe",
    "@xcite , so we might take @xmath33 as a lower bound .",
    "unfortunately , this prior then makes it essentially impossible to convince its holder that aliens exist , since the prior probability for their presence in the observable universe is @xmath34 . besides requiring an extremely high level of statistical confidence before concluding a positive result is correct",
    ", it is essentially impossible to rule out the possibility of systematic errors to that degree . even for a well characterized experiment",
    ", you could always decide that the evidence is always fraudulent , or that you are hallucinating . while such possibilities are unlikely , can you really be sure that they are more unlikely than @xmath2 part in @xmath35 ?",
    "a fundamental disagreement in estimates of @xmath0 is the number of conditions that are required for intelligent life to evolve .",
    "suppose there are @xmath36 conditions that must be fulfilled for aliens to appear , and for simplicity , each is independent of each other and the probability of each holding is @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath38 : so if @xmath39 , @xmath40 ; if @xmath41 , @xmath42 ; if @xmath43 , @xmath44 and so on . if @xmath36 is uncertain at the order of magnitude level , then even the order of magnitude of @xmath0 is also uncertain at the order of magnitude level .",
    "this accounts for the vast disagreements about @xmath0 : an optimist who believes that only a few conditions are relevant can end up thinking that @xmath45 , while a pessimist that believes that thousands of conditions need to be fulfilled can find combinatorially small estimates of @xmath46 .",
    "the notion of an uninformative prior thus suggests that we should use a prior for the number of conditions that is constant in @xmath47 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this translates to a prior that is constant in @xmath48 .",
    "the advantage of this prior is that it can handle scenarios where @xmath36 is allowed to range up to @xmath49 , the entropy of the universe ( with @xmath50 ) , while remaining responsive to any future evidence that aliens exist .",
    "the loose motivation for the log log prior is developed further in more quantitative terms in section  [ sec : basis ] .",
    "the concepts of entropy , information , and state space dimensionality play key roles .",
    "i discuss some problems that arise when trying to formulate a log log prior and apply it .",
    "i also provide a simple model of a seti experiment to demonstrate the prior s response .    the bayesian credibility that etis exist in our past light cone is calculated in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "i use various estimates of the entropy of biological systems and their environments to establish a lower limit to @xmath0 for a planet .",
    "i also describe what happens if we consider smaller birthsites , to allow for the possibility that intelligence evolves off of planets or can evolve many times on a planet .    in section  [ sec : setireach ] ,",
    "i evaluate seti surveys according to how much of the prior s weight they might constrain .",
    "then i discuss some additional problems and implications of the log log prior in section  [ sec : discussion ] : ( 1 ) in a small universe , one can construct a joint prior on the universe s size and @xmath0 , complicating the weighting .",
    "( 2 ) the log log prior suggests that the diversity of intelligent species is beyond astronomically vast . ( 3 ) the small probabilities considered for @xmath0 raise the issue if there s a similarly small probability that intelligent life is starfaring , which would neutralize the fermi paradox .",

    "if @xmath140 is large , @xmath152 , however , the spike in the posterior pdf merely adds a small step to the cdf that does not breach the credibility intervals ; our opinion on @xmath0 is not changed much from the original log log prior . the cumulative increase in the cdf over the `` spike '' is nearly @xmath153 \\frac{dp_{\\rm prior}}{d\\pi } d\\pi}{\\displaystyle \\int_0^{\\pi_{\\rm max } } { \\cal l } [ n_{\\rm report } | n_{\\rm survey } , \\peti(\\pi ) ] \\frac{dp_{\\rm prior}}{d\\pi } d\\pi},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which is about @xmath154^{-1}$ ] if @xmath155 . because @xmath156 , the survey actually could rule out high values of @xmath0 : this is seen as the steep cliffs in the cdf when @xmath140 is small .",
    "if @xmath140 is large , though , the survey does not rule out large @xmath0 , since these could be false negatives .",
    "this is the gist of arguments against the fermi paradox , which apparently rules out other technological societies in the milky way s history , but depends on uncertain assumptions about alien behavior  we might assign some moderately high probability @xmath140 to the possibility that they all stay on their home planets , or that their presence would be undetectable , blunting the paradox .",

    "if there are no systematic errors , the log prior responds to the evidence well ( solid black line in figure  [ fig : logposterior ] ) , showing a similarly sharp spike near @xmath147 for @xmath146 , but systematic errors wash away these features rapidly .",
    "when the systematic errors are as small as @xmath157 ( dotted grey line ) , the spike seems basically unaffected , but the prior weights for other @xmath0 are not exponentially suppressed .",

    "the null result is entirely redundant ; one is far more committed to the prior conclusion that there are no aliens in our past light cone than to any data .",
    "while this demonstration uses an extremely small @xmath105 , it shows that the log log prior responds to both positive and negative results , avoiding a potential pathology of the log prior . as noted above , actual surveys would need to account for their efficiency at detecting any etis who have ever lived .",
    "in addition , the use of a single @xmath140 is a very simplistic model .",
    "more realistically , one might use some function to assign the probability that @xmath139 host planets will be reported as @xmath138 detections .",

    "if the phenotype entropy is small enough , the universe being crowded is favored by the prior ; @xmath300 implies @xmath301 , for example .",

    "the prior probability that the universe is crowded but the solar system is not , with @xmath313 eti arising per @xmath62 of stars , is reduced to a few percent .    if the main bottleneck for the appearance of intelligence is the origin of life , the number of birthsites might increase vastly further still .",
    "it could be that every pool , every rock , every bubble provides an independent opportunity for the origin of life .",
    "when the chance of aliens evolving is just the chance of any life appearing at all , every new chance for abiogenesis must be considered a birthsite .",
    "additional birthsites may also be located at different times in the solar system s evolution , not just different places .",
    "as the sun expands into a red giant , many of the outer icy worlds will become warm enough for surface liquid water oceans @xcite .",

    "a world can also host many birthsites , with multiple chances to play out life s evolution , if mass extinctions devastate it frequently and if the bottlenecks occur late in evolution @xcite .",
    "early in the earth s history , life may have arisen many times after being repeatedly destroyed by impacts @xcite .",
    "if the development of etis requires a particularly robust kind of life prevailing in the biosphere , then earth may have had several opportunities to develop it .",
    "the highest estimate for the number of birthsites in the universe is provided by the @xcite ( ml98 ) bound , a limit on how fast the quantum state of a system can change .",
    "this is a necessary requirement for any kind of dynamics , including biological processes .",
    "we can divide the universe at any given moment into subsystems which may serve as birthplaces for life : these can be as large as the entire observable universe or as small as individual baryons .",
    "according to the ml98 bound , the rate of dynamics is limited to @xmath314 , where @xmath315 is the average difference between the internal energy of the system and its ground state energy @xcite",
    ". then the number of birthsites in a region of spacetime is found by integrating each system s @xmath316 over its volume and adding them together .",
    "since @xmath316 is linear in energy , the total number of birthsites is directly proportional to the amount of internal energy in the region . for cold systems like planets and stars with masses of @xmath210 , @xmath317 . within the past light cone",
    ", the baryonic birthsite number is below @xmath318 where @xmath319 is the comoving distance of an object observed at redshift @xmath320 along the past light cone and @xmath321 is the comoving baryonic density @xcite .",
    "the values for @xmath78 now range from @xmath322 to @xmath6 ( table  [ table : pcrowdedestimates ] ) , about twice the values expected for terrestrial planet birthsites .",
    "the relatively limited effect is because @xmath323 is still only @xmath324 , compared to the @xmath105 values of @xmath325 or less ; @xmath326 is nt much bigger than @xmath327 .",
    "if birthsites did not interfere with each other , then virtually all of the weight in @xmath78 is for scenarios where there is more than one intelligent species per terrestrial planet , as with the cometary birthsite case .",
    "in fact , of the crowded universe scenarios , about half of the weight is for @xmath328 , naively implying @xmath329 etis per planet .",
    "the prior probability that the universe is crowded but not every planet is packed with intelligences is just @xmath330 . but interaction between birthsites can reduce the number of intelligent species that actually appear on a planet .",
    "even if life originates a great number of times on a world , only one biosphere may result , either through merger and symbiosis or elimination and competition .",
    "one can also consider more restrictive definitions of birthsites .",
    "@xcite estimates that most terrestrial planets orbit red dwarfs .",
    "the habitable lifespan of such planets might greatly exceed the age of the universe @xcite , and their @xmath0 values may include intelligences that wo nt evolve for tens of billions of years .",
    "if one only considers those orbiting f , g , or k dwarfs to be potential habitats , then the number of birthsites falls to @xmath331 .",
    "while the resulting @xmath78 values are slightly smaller , the decrease is of order @xmath332 ( total ) or @xmath333 ( relative ) ( table  [ table : pcrowdedestimates ] ) .",
    "the probabilities considered for @xmath105 defy our normal intuitions , being vastly smaller than the probabilities of many situations that seem to violate common sense .",
    "rare astronomical phenomena , like nearby gamma - ray bursts , are not so rare compared to these kinds of odds . likewise ,",
    "whatever the odds are for panspermia , the transfer of life between planets , they are probably high enough that its entropy cost is relatively small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a transfer of life from mars to earth already is a widely considered possibility ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but transfers between the earth and the outer solar system , across interstellar space , or passing back and forth between the inner planets a hundred times would not dent the protocellular entropy .    by itself , this does not mean panspermia is likely  if life is equally likely to arise and thrive on the earth as the other worlds , then it probably started here .",
    "but if other worlds were much more conducive to forming life for some reason , these greater probabilities could easily offset the low probability that life would survive a transfer between a distant world and the earth .",
    "for example , @xcite hypothesized that triton had a thick hydrogen atmosphere shortly after its capture by neptune , a bit like the simulated atmosphere in the urey - miller experiment ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if that chemical environment increased the probability of a limiting step from @xmath334 on earth to @xmath10 , for example , a triton origin for life would not be so implausible .",
    "or we can go much further .",
    "one issue that makes chemical evolution difficult is that the synthesis of different chemicals favors different environments , and the reaction products tend to interfere with one another @xcite .",
    "that difficulty might be evaded by placing the production sites far away from each other , even on different planets ( c.f .",
    "* quoting a thought experiment by robert shapiro ) .",
    "maybe on early earth there was a pool that formed ribose , and it just so happened that a meteorite from a planet in a different star system delivered uracil to the pool , and _ coincidentally _ a meteorite from a guanine planet landed at the same time in the same pool , and _ coincidentally _ a meteorite from an adenine planet landed there too , and _ coincidentally _ that s when a meteorite from a cytosine planet landed there , allowing these ingredients to mix into rna .",
    "it sounds silly , but if there are such planets , this scenario is still probably more likely than a protocell arising through thermal fluctuations . as the probability falls , the number of bizarre paths to life increases , and it becomes essentially impossible to prove that there s only one thermodynamically unlikely way for life to arise .",
    "the log log prior can inform judgments about which seti surveys are effective . while in principle we can not conclusively say that we re isolated until we thoroughly check every habitat in our past light cone , we can be fairly convinced even if we check a fairly small fraction of them , simply because it s unlikely that @xmath0 happens to lie very near @xmath335 .",
    "instead , we simply have to constrain most of the prior s weight before our opinion changes much  that is when the posterior will start to diverge from the prior .",
    "seti surveys observe @xmath336 targets and look for some trace of a technological society .",
    "however , it s important to distinguish between the _ reach _ of a survey and its _ grasp_. in this discussion , reach measures how many targets it observes , regardless of the survey efficiency .",
    "i define the weighted reach as the weight assigned to hypotheses where @xmath337 . for how much prior weight",
    "would the survey find a society if all societies that ever evolved left a detectable trace ?",
    "this can be estimated as @xmath338 the maximum possible @xmath339 is 1 .",
    "grasp , as i define it , is how much of the prior weight could be ruled out if nothing is found : @xmath340 the posterior @xmath341 is then @xmath342 after a null result .",
    "the likelihood here is the estimated probability that at least one society will be found for a given value of @xmath0 .",
    "it is different from reach because not all etis necessarily leave an observable trace .",
    "first , we usually are uncertain about whether etis leave a given trace at all .",
    "this uncertainty is systematic .",
    "for example , whether or not aliens can build megastructures is uncertain ; if megastructures are completely impossible , we will never find any no matter how many targets we search or how big @xmath0 is . in analogy with section  [ sec : posteriorexample ] ,",
    "let @xmath343 be the subjective probability that aliens never leave a trace visible to the survey .",
    "second , there is a statistical factor @xmath344 that measures the detection efficiency of a survey .",
    "this factor might be parameterized as @xmath345 , where @xmath346 is the actual fraction of societies that ever leave a given trace and @xmath347 is the fraction of the traces ever produced that would be visible now .",
    "the former factor could actually be greater than @xmath2 if societies replicate by interstellar travel , although it increases the survey s grasp only if the progenitor society would not have been visible in the original survey @xcite .",
    "the latter factor is roughly the ratio of the trace s lifespan and the universe s age .",
    "an analogy can be made with drake s equation : @xmath346 corresponds to @xmath8 , the probability that an intelligent species forms a communicative society , and @xmath347 corresponds to the lifetime of the society .",
    "note that a trace s lifetime may not equal the society s lifetime  either because the artifacts outlast the society @xcite , or because the society is visible only for a short phase of its existence @xcite .",
    "after accounting for these factors , @xmath348,\\ ] ] remembering that @xmath349 means complete certainty that some intelligent lifeforms leave an observable trace and @xmath350 means the possibility is too far - fetched to consider . plugging in the log log prior , @xmath351}{\\ln ( 1 + \\ln n_{\\rm lc})},\\ ] ] if @xmath352 .",
