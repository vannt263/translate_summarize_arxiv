    "for instance , regarding multiobjective optimization ( when @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) , it is usually admitted that weakly efficient solutions , efficient solutions , and super efficient solutions are preferable from the computational , practical , and stability perspectives , respectively ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) . on the other hand ,",
    "weak orders allow to apply the elegant conjugate duality machinery ( @xcite ) .",

    "this is usually done through the introduction of qualification conditions on @xmath59 ( called constraint qualifications when they only involve @xmath6 and @xmath25 )  allowing to represent @xmath60 in terms of @xmath59 ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
