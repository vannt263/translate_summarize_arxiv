    "graphite and layered material made from metal disulphides ( mos@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 ) and similar composites ( mose@xmath0 , wse@xmath0 , bn , etc . ) are good lubricants since under shear the layers can easily slide over each other due to atomic smoothness and weak van der waals ( vdw ) interactions @xcite",
    ". therefore they are widely used as solid lubricants or additives to liquid lubricants . however",
    ", finite sized crystallites in powders have edges with dangling bonds which can react chemically with the sliding surfaces .",
    "this problem can be avoided by using hollow nanoparticles made from the same material , where the layers are not planar , but are bent into closed shells .",
    "it has been shown recently that multi - walled ws@xmath0 nanoparticles perform very well as additives @xcite .",
    "closer investigations using the surface force apparatus ( sfa ) revealed that ws@xmath0 layers are transfered onto the sliding surfaces by delamination of the nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "these peeled layers form islands on which the friction force microscope measured much smaller friction than on the surrounding mica .",
    "hence multi - walled nanoparticles can act as reservoirs which release layers of low shear strength exactly where needed while avoiding too many dangling bonds .",
    "a theoretical understanding of the mechanical properties of multi - walled hollow nanoparticles is important for future tribological applications . in this paper",
    ", we use scaling arguments based on continuum elasticity theory and pairwise summation of vdw interactions in order to investigate theoretically the effect of adhesion , pressure and shear flow on the deformation and mechanical stability of hollow nanoparticles of spherical shape .",
    "figure [ overview ] schematically depicts some of the aspects discussed in the following .",
    "we show that vdw adhesion to the substrate ( as well as to each other ) can be several orders of magnitude larger than thermal energies and scales linearly with radius , but is almost independent of thickness . despite the large energy of adhesion",
    ", we find that for typical ws@xmath0 nanoparticles , coherent and even incoherent deformations due to the vdw adhesion to the substrate are only in the angstrom range and will leave the nanoparticles basically intact . thus for ws@xmath0 nanoparticles the vdw adhesion favors the release of delaminated layers onto the surfaces , but does not trigger the delamination itself . the main mechanism for delamination of ws@xmath0 nanoparticles is shown to be pressure which leads to a mechanical instability in linear elasticity theory .",
    "this might explain why damage of ws@xmath0 nanoparticles was found to occur only beyond a critical load @xcite .",
    "we also show that shear flow does not lead to considerable deformation of ws@xmath0 nanoparticles and that very large shear rates are needed in order to make adhering particles roll in shear flow .",
    "similar methods have been used before to predict the shape of fullerenes @xcite and to account for the faceted shape of metal disulphide particles @xcite .",
    "compared with _ ab initio _",
    "methods @xcite , tight - binding schemes @xcite and molecular simulations @xcite which have been used before to investigate the mechanical properties of fullerene - like material , our approach has the advantage that it is asymptotically correct for large systems and universal in the sense that different material systems enter on the level of their elastic and vdw constants .",
    "in particular we discuss c , mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , although we focus on the ws@xmath0 nanoparticles used in the tribological experiments mentioned above .",
    "our scaling approach allows us to predict how tribological performance depends on radius @xmath1 , shell thickness @xmath2 and layer thickness @xmath3 of the nanoparticles .",
    "we show that scaling with @xmath2 does not result from the vdw contributions , but rather from the scaling of the elastic constants with @xmath2 .",
    "several critical quantities derived scale strongly with @xmath4 for coherent deformation and with @xmath5 for incoherent deformation . hence tribological performance can be tuned by varying the concentration of defects ( which switches between the coherent and incoherent regime ) and the ratios @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "in the following we consider hollow nanoparticles with outer radius @xmath1 and thickness @xmath2 which results from nesting several elastic shells of thickness @xmath3 each .",
    "typical ws@xmath0 particles used in tribological experiments have @xmath6 nm and @xmath7 nm ( @xmath8 layers with an interlayer distance of @xmath9 nm , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) . in fig .",
    "[ tem ] a high resolution transmission electron micrograph of a ws@xmath0 nanoparticle with @xmath12 layers is shown .",
    "the elastic shells are closed since their formation is driven by the energy reduction due to the absence of dangling bonds . in order to achieve closure",
    ", topology dictates that for carbon shells @xmath13 pentagons have to be inserted into the graphite network of hexagons . for",
    "hexagonally layered composites , the sheets have a more complicated molecular structure ( typically triple layers ) and different kinds of defects have to occur to ensure closure . in our continuum approach , we assume that defects are distributed in a homogeneous way to give a spherical shape with a certain preferred radius @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "similar approaches to fullerene - like particles have considered sheets which are planar in equilibrium ; in order to account for their curvature , they explicitly considered defects @xcite .",
    "however , in this approach the elastic response of a spherical shell is very complicated and no unifying scaling approach is possible .",
    "the new feature of the elasticity of a closed shell with a preferred radius @xmath1 is that stretching is a first - order effect and the spherical shell can not be bent without being stretched @xcite .",
    "this interplay between bending and stretching has been studied before for thermal fluctuations of polymerized vesicles @xcite .",
    "the elastic behavior of the shell is determined by two contributions : bending energy @xmath14 with bending rigidity @xmath15 and mean curvature @xmath16 , and stretching energy @xmath17 with in - plane stretching modulus ( or two - dimensional young modulus ) @xmath18 and in - plane strain @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 represents the surface integral ; the elastic contributions in shell theory follow by integrating over the thickness of the shell . consider a spherical shell of radius @xmath1 which is expanded by @xmath21 .",
    "then @xmath16 changes by @xmath22 and @xmath19 by @xmath23 , thus both contributions are first order effects .",
    "since @xmath24 , the relative strength of bending and stretching depends both on material parameters and radius ; on large length scales @xmath25 and stretching will always dominate .    in the framework of continuum elasticity theory ,",
    "the elastic moduli @xmath15 and @xmath18 can be calculated from the in - plane stretching elastic constant @xmath26 of the corresponding hexagonal layered material as @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the values for @xmath26 are @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 erg/@xmath32 for c , mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , respectively @xcite . the same scaling with @xmath2 is found for thin films made from isotropic elastic material @xcite .",
    "it only applies for coherent bending of the different layers ; for incoherent bending , slip occurs between adjacent layers and overall bending becomes easier .",
    "the bending rigidity then follows as @xmath33 where @xmath3 is the effective thickness of a single layer @xcite .",
    "it should be of the same order of magnitude , but somewhat smaller than the interlayer distance ( which is @xmath34 for c and @xmath35 for mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 ) .",
    "note that the in - plane modulus @xmath36 stays the same since it scales linearly with thickness .",
    "the change from coherent to incoherent bending can be considered to be defect mediated ; dislocations will proliferate for increasing thickness and finally will lead to grain boundaries which account for the typical faceted shape seen in fig .",
    "[ tem ] @xcite .",
    "we consider a substrate which interacts by attractive vdw forces with a film of thickness @xmath2 which is a distance @xmath37 away from the substrate .",
    "pairwise integration of the potential @xmath38 ( where the hamaker constant @xmath39 is typically of the order of @xmath40 erg ) over the two volumes yields the vdw energy per unit area @xmath41 here @xmath37 is an atomic cutoff for the vdw interaction which in the following is chosen to be @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "although the adhesion energy @xmath43 scales linearly with @xmath2 for small @xmath2 , for more than one layer we have @xmath44 and @xmath43 saturates at a constant value @xmath45 erg/@xmath46 . for the case of a single layer , one can replace the volume integral over the film by a surface integral times the effective thickness @xmath2 ; this is equivalent to considering @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vdw ] ) and leads to @xmath48 .",
    "since @xmath37 and @xmath2 are of the same order of magnitude , we essentially recover the result for a multi - layered film .",
    "hence we conclude that due to the rapid saturation of the vdw binding energy with increasing @xmath2 , for multi - layered films under adhesion conditions no considerable scaling with @xmath2 is expected from the vdw terms .",
    "it can be shown by similar arguments ( _ e.g. _  by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : vdw ] ) within the derjaguin approximation ) that the energy of a hollow nanoparticle adhering to a substrate does not depend on @xmath2 as long as @xmath49{$\\;\\stackrel{>}{\\sim}\\;$}}d$ ] .",
    "then the adhesion energy equals the vdw energy of close approach between a sphere and a substrate , @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "using values for @xmath39 , @xmath37 and @xmath1 as given above yields @xmath51 kt . the energy of adhesion between two particles is only a factor of @xmath52 smaller than the one between a particle and the substrate , and hence well above thermal energies as well .",
    "we thus conclude that the vdw interaction leads to considerable adhesion of the particles to the substrate and to each other .",
    "the same holds true for peeled off outer layers : with @xmath53 nm , the energy of adhesion can be estimated to be @xmath54 kt .",
    "the onset of delamination can be estimated by considering large deformations of the nanoparticles .",
    "we do not offer a theory for fracture and estimate the limit of mechanical stability by an internal criterion within our continuum description : fracture and delamination sets in when so much stress has accumulated that the deformation becomes of the order of the radius .",
    "determining the deformation of a spherical elastic shell is a difficult problem which depends on prestress , elastic constants and size as well as on the nature of the deforming force .",
    "here we discuss the deformation on a substrate for two cases which can be treated in the framework of our scaling approach . in the following @xmath55",
    "is the indentation . for small deformations @xmath56 ( fig .",
    "[ deformation]a ) , the shell flattens at the bottom . for large deformations @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "[ deformation]b ) , a contact disc with radius @xmath58 develops and the elastic energy is localized in the circular fold surrounding it .",
    "the respective elastic energies are @xcite @xmath59 here we neglect a bending term @xmath60 .",
    "we also assumed that due to low friction , slip can occur between the contact disc and the substrate ; otherwise compression energy @xmath61 would accumulate in the contact disc .",
    "the rest of the relaxing shell is assumed to keep a spherical form with radius @xmath62 in order to keep area constant and to avoid compression energy .",
    "however , the difference is @xmath63 and can be shown to be negligible in the following .",
    "if the deformations are driven by vdw adhesion , the energy gained on adhesion can be shown to scale as @xmath64 for both small and large deformations . setting this adhesion energy equal to the estimates for the elastic energies from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deformation ] ) yields estimates for indentation : @xmath65 here and in the following we will always give the result both in terms of the elastic moduli and their scaling with thickness for coherent bending . the dimensionless quantity",
    "@xmath66 is the ratio of van der waals adhesion energy to two - dimensional young modulus and will be of order @xmath67 for the ws@xmath0 nanoparticles . in this case",
    "we are in the regime @xmath56 and deformations will be in the angstrom range .",
    "thus delamination can not be expected to be caused by adhesion . for incoherent bending",
    ", @xmath4 has to be replaced by @xmath5 in both regimes .",
    "one system for which vdw adhesion leads to strong deformations are _ single - walled _ hollow nanoparticles . in this case",
    ", care has to be taken to use the correct values for @xmath18 and @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath18 is a purely two - dimensional quantity , @xmath28 can be used where @xmath2 is identified with the interlayer distance .",
    "however , @xmath15 has to be extracted from molecular calculations @xcite . for carbon",
    ", one finds @xmath68 erg/@xmath46 and @xmath69 kt . for both mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , @xmath18 is smaller by a factor @xmath70 and @xmath15 is larger by a factor @xmath71 . in all three cases , for radii larger than a few nm considerable deformations arise .",
    "the critical radius @xmath72 where indentation @xmath55 and radius @xmath1 become of the same magnitude follows from the second relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : flattening ] ) as @xmath73 . for c",
    ", we find @xmath74 and for the metal disulphides @xmath75 . for nanotubes , we find similar results which are in good agreement with experiments and molecular calculations @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to show that pressure can lead to an instability which could account for the observed delamination .",
    "we consider the formation of a contact disc for a shell which is pressed onto the substrate by pressure in the surrounding liquid .",
    "the corresponding energy is @xmath76 , thus it scales more strongly with @xmath55 than the restoring elastic energy @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deformation ] ) .",
    "this scaling indicates an instability : small deformations are suppressed , but large deformations grow without limits beyond the critical indentation @xmath78 where @xmath79 attains a maximum @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath80 gives an estimate for the critical pressure for delamination : @xmath81 using typical values gives @xmath82 gpa .",
    "incoherent deformations can be treated by replacing @xmath83 by @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : criticalpressure ] ) and hence would decrease the estimate to @xmath85 mpa .",
    "although a full treatment of the instability requires a theory for the non - linear elasticity , we can still suggest that pressure will be a very likely mechanism to cause delamination .",
    "this prediction agrees nicely with the experimental observation that damage sets in at a finite threshold of the load @xcite .",
    "note that for single - walled buckyballs c@xmath86 with @xmath87 , eq .  ( [ eq : criticalpressure ] ) gives @xmath88 gpa which is in surprisingly good agreement with the value @xmath89 gpa found experimentally @xcite .",
    "although the pressure values estimated here seem to be high , they refer to particles of nm - size , and the corresponding forces are of the order of @xmath90 dyn . in friction experiments ,",
    "the pressures and forces needed for delamination are most likely to occur near asperities .",
    "this might explain why delamination has been observed in the sfa only when shearing the two surfaces @xcite : the nanoparticles then behaves as granular material which gets jammed and pressure and forces become localized .",
    "since the ws@xmath0 nanoparticles are immersed in liquid lubricant in strong motion , we finally consider the effect of shear flow .",
    "balancing the deforming viscous force with the elastic restoring force and setting the resulting deformation equal to the radius gives an estimate for the shear rate at which delamination sets in .",
    "for @xmath91 , we find that only stretching is relevant and that the critical shear rate is @xmath92 using viscosity @xmath93 cp ( which applies both to water and mineral oil ) , we find @xmath94 hz .",
    "such high shear rates are unattainable even near contacting asperities in macroscopic friction experiments , thus delamination is not likely to occur due to shear flow alone .",
    "shear flow past nanoparticle adhering to a substrate can cause them to roll .",
    "the particle begins to roll if the viscous drag evaluated at the midpoint , @xmath95 , equals the friction force @xmath96 caused by the adhesive load @xmath97 . assuming amontons law for rolling friction , @xmath98 , we find @xmath99 where the coefficient of rolling friction @xmath100 can be taken to have the typical value @xmath90 ; then @xmath101 is of the order of @xmath102 hz . this value is higher than typical shear rates probed with the sfa ( @xmath103 m/s , @xmath104 hz on nm - separation ) , but certainly lower than shear rates occurring near the asperities of macroscopic friction experiments ( @xmath105 m/s , @xmath106 hz on nm - separation )",
    "we have shown that in friction experiments with multi - walled hollow nanoparticles , delamination is likely to be caused by pressure . when nanoparticles delaminate , dangling bonds develop as they do for powders from layered material . however , there are two reasons why they should be less problematic .",
    "first delamination takes place with one or two layers and the density of dangling bonds remains low .",
    "second we showed that delamination may occur under adhering conditions .",
    "the adhesion ( and possibly the shear ) will cause the layers to align parallel to the substrate , in contrast to the powders where the orientation is preferentially perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "it has been shown experimentally that delaminated layers from nanoparticles form islands while platelets form a thicker , more disorganized film @xcite .",
    "our scaling approach shows that there are two control parameters which might be used for tribological optimization : the ratio of radius to thickness and the concentration of defects ( that determine the regimes of coherent and incoherent bending ) .",
    "using nanoparticles as additives to liquid lubricants raises interesting questions about the role of wetting .",
    "the lubricant used in the friction experiments mentioned is a bad solvent for the nanoparticles , which provides an additional force to drive them onto the substrate .",
    "a dewetted region is expected to form between the adhering particle and the substrate ; like a capillary bridge in a good wetting situation , it might enhance adhesion .",
