    "many mechanisms are proposed to explain the phenomenon of charmonium suppression@xcite in relativistic heavy ion collisions@xcite . in models@xcite ,",
    "the charmonium is supposed to be created by the hard processes in the initial state , on the way out , it firstly collides inelastically with spectators which leads to the normal suppression@xcite .",
    "the anomalous suppression@xcite is attributed to different mechanisms : collisions with spectators@xcite , instantly melting in quark - gluon plasma ( qgp)@xcite , collisions with gluons in qgp@xcite or collisions with hadronic comovers@xcite .",
    "recently , there appeared another kind of models@xcite based on the assumption that charmonium is created at qcd hadronization according to statistical law , which is the extrapolation of the well - tested thermal model@xcite for light hadrons .",
    "there is also a two component model@xcite which mixes these two kinds of mechanisms . with some adjustable parameters in each mechanism",
    ", almost all models can describe the @xmath0 anomalous suppression data at sps very well . in order to differentiate these models ,",
    "we need more information such as open charm , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) distribution . in this letter",
    ", we concentrate on the observables related to the @xmath4 distribution of @xmath0 , the average transverse momentum @xmath5 and the anisotropic asymmetry parameter ( @xmath6 ) of @xmath0 as well as the @xmath4 integrated anomalous suppression in the heavy ion collisions at sps and rhic .",
    "we follow the method in refs .",
    "@xcite to treat the anomalous suppression .",
    "we neglect the formation time and assume that the charmonium is created instantaneously after the binary collisions .",
    "on the way out , it collides firstly with spectators and then with gluons in the qgp .",
    "the former and the later are , respectively , the origin of normal and anomalous suppression in our approach .",
    "the qgp evolution is calculated with a 2 + 1 dimensional boost invariant relativistic hydrodynamics@xcite . since @xmath0 is heavy enough , a classical boltzmann - type transport equation in the transverse phase space@xcite",
    "is used to describe the evolution of its transverse distribution function .",
    "we assume that the local equilibrium is reached at a proper time @xmath7 when the normal suppression has ceased and the anomalous suppression starts .",
    "therefore , the initial condition of the transport equation is determined by the normal suppression .",
    "we neglect the elastic collisions between charmonium and particles in the medium , for the much larger charmonium mass than the typical temperature of the medium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the evolution of the medium in section 2 , give the details of the cross sections between charmonium and particles in section 3 , discuss the transverse transport equation in section 4 , and show the numerical results in section 5 .",
    "finally we conclude in section 6 .",
    "as in ref.@xcite , we assume that the produced medium reaches local equilibrium at a proper time @xmath8 fm / c for @xmath9a gev pb - pb collisions at sps and @xmath10 fm / c for @xmath11a gev au - au collisions at rhic . the consequent evolution is described with relativistic hydrodynamics , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath14 the baryon current with four - velocity @xmath15 of the fluid cell , energy density @xmath16 , pressure @xmath17 and baryon density @xmath18 . in our calculation , we use bjorken s hydrodynamical model@xcite . with the hubble - like longitudinal expansion and boost invariant initial condition , the hydrodynamical quantities are functions of the proper time @xmath19 and transverse coordinates only , and the equations can be simplified as @xmath20 with the definitions @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the lorentz factor .    to close the hydrodynamical equations we need to know the equation of state of the medium .",
    "we follow ref.@xcite where the deconfined phase at high temperature is an ideal gas of massless @xmath25 , @xmath26 quarks , 150 mev massed @xmath27 quarks and gluons , and the hadron phase at low temperature is an ideal gas of all known hadrons and resonences with mass up to 2 gev@xcite .",

    "the mean field repulsion parameter and the bag parameter are chosen as @xmath28=450 mev @xmath29@xcite and @xmath30=236 mev to obtain the critical temperature @xmath31 mev at vanishing baryon number density .",
    "we assume that the medium maintains chemical and thermal equilibrium until the energy density of the system drops to a value of @xmath32 mev/@xmath29 , when the hadrons decouple and their momentum distributions are fixed .",
    "we have tested that a slight modification on the freeze - out condition will not change our conclusions .    at sps energy , we follow ref.@xcite to set the initial energy density and baryon number density with the wounded nucleon number density , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the thickness function of nuclear a(b ) with nuclear density profile @xmath35 .",
    "we choose woods - saxon profile , @xmath36 .",
    "the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 are from ref.@xcite . at rhic energy ,",
    "we follow refs.@xcite and assign 75% of the entropy density to soft contribution which is proportional to the wounded nucleon number density and 25% to hard contribution which is proportional to the binary collision number density @xmath41 .",
    "the baryon density is obtained by adjusting the entropy per baryon to 250@xcite .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section @xmath42 is 32 mb at sps and increases to 41 mb at rhic .    in peripheral collisions or in the peripheral region of central collisions , the system can not reach thermalization even if the energy density is larger than the critical value for phase transition . in order to describe this effect , we incorporated a cut in the initial condition .",
    "we assume that the medium will hadronize and decouple at the initial time if the local entropy density is less than a critical value @xmath43 .",
    "this critical value will be an adjustable parameter of our approach , and will be fixed by fitting the @xmath0 anomalous suppression data at sps .",

    "we have neglected the medium effect on the dissociation cross sections . in relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",

    "we can calculate it in this rest frame .",

    "when we know the time evolution of the produced medium and the @xmath45 dissociation cross section in the medium , we can calculate the number of @xmath45 and its @xmath4 distribution at freeze - out time @xmath98 with eq .",

    "it is obvious that due to the missing of @xmath104 fluctuation in our calculation , the anomalous suppression starts suddenly at @xmath105 gev .",
    "with increasing centrality , the volume and the life - time of the produced qgp will increase , and the anomalous suppression becomes more and more important .",
    "a good fit with the suppression data has been achieved in the whole @xmath104 range except in most central collisions where the fluctuations was shown to be important@xcite .",
    "suppression and @xmath5 as functions of centrality at sps energy . ]    after fitting the parameter @xmath43 , we can calculate observables related to the @xmath4 broadening effect . in fig.[sps ] ( b ) , we show the @xmath5 as a function of @xmath104 .",
    "the dashed and solid lines are , respectively , @xmath106 calculated without and with anomalous suppression .",
    "the later agrees well with the experimental results from na50@xcite . with increasing centrality , @xmath5 increases steadily till @xmath107 gev .",
    "after that , @xmath5 becomes saturated and finally drops slightly in most central collisions .",
    "there are two competing mechanisms that affect @xmath106 : the @xmath0 with large @xmath4 is mostly produced in central collisions according to the cronin effect .",
    "since the matter produced in central collisions is denser and hotter than that in peripheral collisions , the @xmath0 with large @xmath4 has more chance to be absorbed by the qgp ; on the other hand , the @xmath0 with large @xmath4 has more chance to escape the anomalous suppression region , when its duration time in the qgp is shorter than the anomalous suppression time .",
    "this is the leakage effect initially indicated by matsui and satz@xcite and studied in detail in the transport approach in @xcite .",
    "the former mechanism suppresses the @xmath5 , while the later enhances the @xmath5 .    with the fixed parameter @xmath43 , we calculate now the @xmath0 suppression and @xmath5 at rhic energy .",
    "fig.[rhic ] ( a ) shows that our result on @xmath0 suppression agrees with the low statistical data from phenix@xcite .",
    "the suppression at rhic is much stronger than that at sps , but does not approach zero . since there is still no transverse momentum data from rhic , we displayed only the theoretical results in fig.[rhic ] ( b ) .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath5 at rhic is similar to the corresponding result at sps energy .",
    "however , it is obvious that the leakage effect prevails even in very central collisions , and there is no clear decrease of @xmath5 , very different from the predictions@xcite calculated with @xmath4 independent dissociations and without considering the leakage effect .",
    "suppression and @xmath5 as functions of centrality at rhic energy . ]     of @xmath0 as a function of centrality at sps and rhic . ]",
    "finally we consider the elliptical flow defined by @xmath108    in high - energy nuclear collisions , the initial spatial anisotropy is transferred to final momentum anisotropy via partonic and/or hadronic interactions .",
    "interesting information about the early stage of the hot and dense medium may be obtained from the study of this azimuthal anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "the measured values of anisotropy @xmath6 of hadrons with light quarks ( u , d , s ) at rhic are positive and large compared with lower energy results , and show a clear hadron mass dependence in the low transverse momentum region , @xmath109 gev / c @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic calculations have been used to explain the observed collective expansion behavior @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic charm mass is large compared with the initial temperature that might be reached at rhic @xcite .",
    "therefore , any collective motion of charmed hadrons will be a useful tool for studying : ( i ) charm production mechanism in nuclear collisions : via direct early pqcd - type creation @xcite or via later coalescence @xcite ; ( ii ) early thermalization of light flavors ( u , d , s ) in the high - energy nuclear collisions . in the case of thermalization , if coalescence is the dominant process for charmed hadron production , @xmath6 could be large@xcite , while it is predicated that the direct pqcd produced charmed hadrons carry small or zero @xmath6",
    ". however , the leakage effect , discussed above , will lead to finite @xmath6 for @xmath0 in non - central collisions@xcite .",
    "this can be understood transparently : the anormalous suppression of the @xmath0 depends on the length that the particle travels throught the medium .",
    "hence more suppression is expected in the out - of - plane direction ( y - direction ) which leads to finte value of @xmath6 with positive sign .    in fig.[v2fig ]",
    "the solid and dashed lines are our results of @xmath0 @xmath6 at fixed transverse momentum @xmath110 gev / c at sps and rhic .",
    "it is clear that @xmath6 is not zero but finite in mid - central collisions .",
    "for very central and very peripheral collisions @xmath6 approaches to zero due to symmetric anomalous absorption and no anomalous absorption , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath6 at rhic are found to be larger than that at sps due to the fact that the colored medium created at rhic has larger volume and longer life - time which lead to the stronger leakage effect .",
    "if the @xmath0 s are created at hadronization , their minimum - bias @xmath6 has been evaluated in coalescence model with the assumption of complete thermalization of charm quark with the medium and the assumption of the same maximum @xmath6 ( about 9% ) for charm and light quarks@xcite .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",

    "the minimum - bias @xmath111 which is the average of @xmath6 over the impact parameter should be less than the maximum .",
    "it is clear to see that the maximal @xmath6 calculated in the frame of @xmath0 transport is less than @xmath112 of that calculated in the approach with full charm quark thermalization @xcite .     as a function of @xmath4 at rhic energy .",
    "the solid line is the maximal @xmath6 with impact parameter b=7.8 fm calculated in the frame of @xmath0 transport , and the dashed line is the minimum - bias @xmath6 ( scaled by a factor of 0.1 ) of the coalescence model with the assumption of complete charm quark thermalization . ]",
    "by combining the hydrodynamic equations for the qgp evolution and the transport equation for the primordially produced @xmath0 in the qgp , and considering the anomalous charmonium suppression induced by the gluon dissociation process , we calculated the @xmath0 suppression , averaged transverse momentum square , and elliptic flow at sps and rhic energies .",
    "it is found that the leakage effect reflected in the transport equation and the @xmath4 dependence of the charmonium dissociation cross sections play an important rule in explaining the experimental @xmath4 broadening effect at sps .    in our transport approach",
    ", the main driving force of the elliptic flow is the leakage effect , the @xmath0 s moving in the direction of the long axis of the anisotropic medium are strongly suppressed , but those moving in the direction of the short axis are easy to escape the medium .",
    "the inelastic interaction with the medium will transfer collective flow to the charmonium , but the effect is small . since the primordially produced @xmath0 is not thermalized in our transport approach , the calculated @xmath6 is the low limit of the @xmath0 elliptic flow .",
    "any calculation with partial or full charm quark or charmonium thermalization should be larger than this low limit . from the comparison of theoretical calculations in different models with the experimental data ,",
    "the elliptic flow may be a useful tool to determine which mechanism is the dominant one of @xmath0 production , initial pqcd production , coalescence at hadronization , or the mixture of the both .    the possible gain term on the right hand side of the transport equation due to the recombination of @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the parton stage will probably enhance the charmonium production at rhic energy and affect @xmath5 and elliptic flow .",
