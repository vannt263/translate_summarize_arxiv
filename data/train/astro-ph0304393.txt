    "except at very low radio frequencies , most electromagnetic telescopes have good angular rejection , so that faint sources and backgrounds can be seen by looking between bright sources .",
    "in contrast all currently implemented gravitational wave detectors , and most of those envisaged for the future , simultaneously respond to sources all over the sky , modified only by a beam pattern of typically quadrupole form .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the brightness of the gravitational wave sky , since this will limit the ultimate sensitivity attainable in gravitational wave astronomy . one immediate pressure to understand this background comes from the need to set design requirements for the esa / nasa laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) mission ( lisa mission documents and status may be found at http://lisa.jpl.nasa.gov/ and http://sci.esa.int/home/lisa/ ) .",
    "in this paper , we attempt to predict the gravitational wave background produced by all the binary stars in the universe , excluding neutron stars and black holes .",
    "this is believed to be the principal source of gravitational wave background in the frequency range @xmath3 hz .",
    "below @xmath4 hz , the background is probably dominated by merging supermassive black holes , and above @xmath5 hz , it is probably dominated by merging neutron stars and stellar mass black holes ( whose complicated and poorly understood formation histories and birth velocities make predictions more uncertain , cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    besides the extragalactic background",
    ", there is also a galactic background produced by the binary stars in our milky way ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the galactic background is many times larger in amplitude than both the extragalactic background and lisa s design sensitivity , the individual binaries contributing to it can be ( spectrally ) resolved and removed at frequencies above @xmath6 hz @xcite . below this frequency they can not be removed ( at least in a mission of reasonable lifetime @xmath7 years ) , but the unresolved galactic background will be quite anisotropic . as the detector beam pattern rotates about the sky , the galactic background will thus be modulated , while the isotropic ( or nearly so ; see @xcite ) distant extragalactic background will not .",
    "modelling of the angular distribution of the galactic background using both _ a priori _ models and the observed distribution of higher frequency resolved sources will thus allow the galactic background to be subtracted to some precision ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , there will be anisotropies due to the distribution of local galaxies , at the level of 10 per cent of the distant extragalactic background from the lmc , and at the per cent level from m31 or the virgo cluster ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the immediate motivation for this work is a design issue for lisa .",
    "one of lisa s major science goals ( see the lisa science requirements document at http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/listwg1/ ) is the detection of gravitational waves from compact objects spiralling into supermassive black holes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , since these can provide precision tests of strong field relativity and the no - hair theorem @xcite .",
    "however , these signals are weak , and their templates not yet fully understood .",
    "it has thus been proposed that lisa should be designed with somewhat greater sensitivity to increase the probability that these signals are detected .",
    "however , this would be pointless if the principal background were cosmological rather than instrumental . as we shall see ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lisa ] ) , we find that this is most probably almost , but not quite the case at the relevant frequencies ( @xmath8 mhz ) .",
    "so there would be a point to increasing lisa s sensitivity in the @xmath8 mhz range , but not to increasing it by more than a factor of 3 in gravitational wave amplitude @xmath9 ( 9 in @xmath10 ) .",
    "a second motivation for this work comes from the fact that this background is an astrophysical _ foreground _ to searches ( both with lisa and with future detectors with extended frequency range and sensitivity ) for backgrounds produced in the very early universe .",
    "gravitational waves from bubble walls and turbulence following the electroweak phase transition are expected to be in the lisa frequency band , with amplitude that could be well above lisa instrumental sensitivity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another potential source of isotropic gravitational waves in the lisa band are those produced when dimensions beyond the familiar four compactified , which occurred when the universe had temperature @xmath11tev @xcite .",
    "note that detection of a gravitational wave background can possibly be made even if it is considerably below the noise limit of the lisa detectors shown in our fig .",
    "[ fig : lisa ] .",
    "this can be done by comparing the signals from michelson beam combinations ( sensitive to instrument noise and gravitational waves ) with sagnac beam combinations ( sensitive to instrument noise , but insensitive to gravitational waves ) , thus calibrating the instrumental noise cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves are the only directly detectable relic of inflation in the early universe , and their detection over a range of frequencies would provide a valuable test of models of inflation @xcite . it has been proposed that advanced space - based gravitational wave detectors might search for the background of gravitational waves from inflation .",
    "the gravitational waves from slow - roll inflation models contribute to the critical density in the universe @xmath12 per octave of frequency .",
    "we shall see ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wdtypes ] , [ fig : nsources ] ) that the gravitational wave background from cosmological binaries makes such detection impractical except at frequencies below @xmath4 hz ( where supermassive black holes continue to make it impossible ) , or above @xmath13 hz .    a third motivation is that a detection of the extragalactic binary background , e.g. by lisa , would set an independent ( and unaffected by dust extinction ) constraint on a combination of the star formation history of the universe and binary star evolution .",
    "there have been previous estimates of the extragalactic binary background .",
    "@xcite made detailed estimates of the galactic binary background , and estimated that the extragalactic background from close double white dwarf pairs should be about 2 per cent ( in flux or @xmath14 units ) of the galactic background .",
    "this estimate was refined , using more modern star formation histories , by @xcite , who found instead a level of @xmath1510 per cent .",
    "@xcite used a descendant of the utrecht population synthesis code to estimate the extragalactic binary background as a function of frequency , and claimed that the background should have a large peak at @xmath16 hz , just below the frequency at which typical binaries have a lifetime that equals the age of the universe .",
    "we have followed the spirit of this previous work , but with an independent binary population synthesis code .",
    "more importantly , we have devoted much effort to the normalisation of the background , to understanding the contributions of different types of binaries and their formation pathways to the background , and to estimating the uncertainties in all of these , so that we can have a better idea of the sources and level of uncertainty in the predicted background .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : lgw ] , we describe the gravitational wave ( gw ) emission from a binary system , then in section [ sec : evol ] we outline the main evolutionary pathways to the close double degenerate ( dd ) stage , which we shall see is the dominant source of gw background in the lisa band . in section [ sec : anal ] , we use the preceding sections to make some simple analytic arguments about the nature of dd inspiral spectra . we describe the use of the bse code in our population synthesis , in section [ sec : test ] , then go on to construct a set of synthesis models whose results we test against the observed galactic dd population .",
    "we also motivate some modifications made to the prescription for the evolution of am cvn stars in the bse code . in section [ sec : cosmocalc ] , we present the cosmological integrals used in the code , along with the cosmic star formation history and overall normalisation chosen .",
    "section [ sec : results ] is devoted to a discussion of the gw background spectra produced by our code , in terms of the systems contributing to the background and the progenitors of these sources .",
    "we also discuss the differences between our population synthesis models . in section [ sec : opt_pes ] , we place limits on the maximum and minimum expected background signals , and compare these with the lisa sensitivity and in section [ sec : prev ] with previous work . in section [ sec : conclusion ] we summarise and conclude .",
    "a binary system of stars in circular orbit with masses @xmath17 and @xmath18 and orbital separation @xmath19 emits gravitational radiation , at the expense of its orbital energy , at a rate given by @xcite @xmath20 where primes denote quantities expressed in solar units , i.e. @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the gravitational radiation is emitted at twice the orbital frequency @xmath23 of the binary , @xmath24 .",
    "if the binary is eccentric with eccentricity @xmath25 , this expression must be generalised to include emission at all harmonics @xmath26 of the orbital frequency , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",

    "[ eq : sumharm ] , @xmath35 as a function of @xmath36 consists of points along a skewed bell - shaped curve with maximum near the relative angular velocity at pericentre , where the greatest accelerations are experienced ( @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the angular velocity of the relative orbit at pericentre , @xmath39 ) . in terms of harmonic number ,",
    "a good approximation for all @xmath25 ( becoming very good for @xmath40 ) is that @xmath41 peaks at @xmath42 , and @xmath43 peaks at @xmath44 .",
    "we shall see that the gw background is dominated by the emission from close double degenerate ( dd ) binaries at frequencies @xmath45 hz . in this work , the term dd will refer to wd  wd pairs and loosely to wd ",
    "naked helium star pairs , i.e. we exclude neutron stars from our definition . in this section",
    "we describe the two main evolutionary pathways from the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) to the close dd stage .",
    "the route followed depends mainly on the initial orbital separation of the zams stars .",
    "similar descriptions can be found in e.g. @xcite .",
    "we begin with an intermediate - mass zams binary system with primary mass @xmath17 , secondary mass @xmath18 ( @xmath46 ) , semi - major axis @xmath19 and eccentricity @xmath25",
    ". the orbit may evolve somewhat due to tidal interactions between the stars , particularly if they have convective envelopes .",
    "when the primary evolves off the main sequence and swells in size , it may fill its roche lobe and start to transfer matter on to the secondary .",
    "the stability of this mass transfer determines which of the two main pathways to the dd stage is commenced .",
    "if the primary fills its roche lobe when it has a deep convective envelope ( i.e. on the red giant branch ( rgb ) or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) ) , then for mass ratios @xmath47 , the ensuing mass transfer is dynamically unstable ( for conservative transfer ) . the envelope of the primary spills on to the secondary on a dynamical timescale , leading to the formation of a common envelope , inside which orbit the secondary and the core of the primary . the envelope is frictionally heated at the expense of the stars orbital energy , until eventually either they coalesce , or the envelope is heated sufficiently that it is ejected from the system , leaving the primary s core ( a hot subdwarf which will rapidly cool to become a wd , or if the primary was on the rgb and had mass @xmath48 , then a helium star which will evolve to the wd stage ) .",
    "the basic idea of the common envelope phase is well accepted and observationally motivated , though not well simulated ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several formalisms have been proposed to model it in population synthesis studies .",
    "the evolution code used here ( see section [ sec : bse ] ) follows closely the prescription of @xcite ( originally from @xcite ) , in which @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the initial binding energy of the envelope of the overflowing giant star ( or the sum of both envelopes binding energies if both stars are giants ) , parametrized by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is of order unity , and is calculated in the bse code ( see section [ sec : candidates ] ) . @xmath53 and @xmath54 are respectively the initial and final orbital binding energies of the core - plus - secondary system , and @xmath55 is the so - called common envelope efficiency parameter , also of order unity , usually taken to be a parameter to be fitted to observations .",
    "variations to this prescription will be considered in sections [ sec : obs ] and [ sec : candidates ] .",
    "continuing with the system s evolution , the secondary star later evolves off the main sequence , and a second common envelope phase is likely to occur , leading to further orbital shrinkage .",
    "if once again the stars do not coalesce then we will be left with a close(r ) pair of remnants , one or both of which may be helium stars , which in time will evolve to the wd stage .",
    "( it is not uncommon for either helium star to overflow its roche lobe upon leaving the helium main sequence ; this can lead to either stable mass transfer or to a futher common envelope phase . ) in this picture , the second - formed wd will be the less massive of the pair , since the giant star from which it descended had a smaller core mass when its core growth was halted as it lost its envelope .",
    "if roche lobe overflow occurs when the primary is in the hertzsprung gap , that is after the primary has exhausted its core hydrogen and before it has developed a deep convective envelope and ascended the giant branch , then roche lobe overflow may be dynamically stable for moderate mass ratios , and a phase of stable but rapid mass transfer can occur . in this way , the primary transfers its envelope to the secondary , leaving a compact remnant , and a common envelope phase is avoided , since by the time the primary evolves to the giant branch , the mass ratio has been sufficiently inverted that mass transfer remains dynamically stable .",
    "the orbital separation will typically have increased during this phase ( for conservative mass transfer at least ) , since much of the transfer was from the less - massive to the more - massive star .",
    "when the secondary evolves off the main sequence , it will most likely fill its roche lobe on the rgb , so that a common envelope phase ensues , and a close dd is born , provided that the resulting orbital shrinkage does not lead to coalescence .",
    "the second - formed wd will this time be the more massive , since its progenitor was the more evolved at the time of its overflow .    the initial conditions for this route occupy a smaller range in initial orbital semimajor axis than the cee+cee route , but as it results in the injection of dd systems only at very short periods , we expect both pathways to be significant contributors to the close dd population , i.e. those systems contributing to the gw background in the lisa waveband .",
    "we note also that both routes ought to lead to the production of dds with circular orbits , even if the zams eccentricity was non - zero , since tidal circularisation is rapid when a system contains a near - roche lobe - filling convective star .",
    "given only the above , we can make some predictions as to the shape of the gw spectrum seen today .",
    "a somewhat analogous treatment is given in @xcite .",
    "we consider the evolution under gw emission of a population of dds after creation as in section [ sec : evol ] , with circular orbits .",
    "we deal here with detached systems ; the spectral shape due to interacting pairs is discussed in section [ sec : inter ] .    here and throughout",
    ", we use @xmath23 for orbital frequencies and @xmath2 for gravitational wave frequencies . for circular orbits , @xmath56 .",
    "the number density @xmath57 of binary wds per unit orbital frequency interval at time @xmath58 must obey the continuity equation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the birth rate ( after nuclear evolution and mass transfer ) of wd  wd systems per unit frequency . now for a given source , we know that @xmath61 , and using eq .",
    "[ eq : lcirc ] along with @xmath62 and kepler s law , we obtain @xmath63 where we have used the definition of the chirp mass @xmath64 , @xmath65    we solve eq .",
    "[ eq : fdot ] to give the evolution @xmath66 for @xmath67 , i.e. for a single source injected at frequency @xmath68 at time @xmath69 ,    @xmath70    the corresponding source number density ( green s function for eq .",
    "[ eq : cont ] ) @xmath71 as a function of time is given by @xmath72\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since , as the system traces out a path in @xmath23 , it spends a time at each point inversely proportional to its velocity @xmath73 through frequency space .",
    "we then consider a real injection spectrum @xmath74 , for @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting number density @xmath57 is given by @xmath76 since @xmath77 , we can then construct the gw emission spectrum by taking @xmath78 .",
    "the choice of dd injection spectrum is therefore instrumental in determining the shape of the gw emission spectrum .",
    "we can estimate its shape as follows : we will later choose to distribute zams orbital semimajor axis uniformly in @xmath79 , i.e. also uniformly in @xmath80 , for given initial @xmath17 and @xmath18 . we suppose that , for at least the cee+cee route ( see section [ sec : evol ] ) , the common envelope phases lead to some mean orbital shrinkage factor , so that wd ",
    "wd pairs at their birth are also distributed roughly uniformly in @xmath81 .",
    "we then have @xmath82 , from some @xmath83 of interest , up to @xmath84 ( see also fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "this is the maximum orbital frequency at which a system can exit a common envelope phase and survive to become a wd ",
    "wd pair . upon ce",
    "exit , the newly exposed stellar core will be a hot subdwarf , larger than the wd it will cool to become , or it could be a naked helium star , which will eventually evolve to the wd stage . the maximum injection frequency at wd ",
    "wd birth is set by the minimum orbital separation that will keep this object ( and the first - formed wd ) from overflowing its roche lobe on the way to the wd stage , whether this is at the exit of common envelope or ( applicable to the helium star case ) as its radius changes due to nuclear evolution .    for illustration",
    ", we compute the emergent spectrum for a fiducial population of @xmath85 wd  wd pairs . the radius of a 0.5 m@xmath86 naked helium star does not exceed @xmath87 r@xmath86 on its way to the wd stage , which sets @xmath88 mhz .",
    "if we then assign a constant pair formation rate , so that @xmath89 , and perform the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : spec ] , we obtain the spectral shape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfh_const ] .",
    "note that the spectrum is truncated at a frequency above which the inspiralling wds would undergo roche lobe overflow and merge , @xmath90 mhz .    if instead we only inject sources for @xmath91 , and look at the spectrum obtained for @xmath92 gyr , ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfh_burst ] ) , we see that the basic spectral shape is little affected .",
    "because of the strong dependence of @xmath73 on @xmath23 , a given system of specified age will either have merged or will have remained at essentially constant separation .",
    "thus there are two clear physical regimes displayed in the spectra , separated by the injection frequency from which a source could have reached contact due to gw losses in the time @xmath58 since its birth , @xmath93 mhz for @xmath94 gyr .",
    "( in all relevant situations for us , @xmath95 . )    at @xmath96 lies a ` static regime ' , in which losses due to gw are negligible in the time available , giving @xmath97 and hence @xmath98 . for @xmath99",
    ", we are in the ` spiral - in ' regime . in the case of a burst of dd formation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfh_burst ] ) , sources simply sweep through this region on the way to merger , so that we have @xmath100 , giving @xmath101 .",
    "if we have a constant dd formation rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfh_const ] ) , then for @xmath102 , merging systems are continually being injected , so that @xmath103 is less steeply decreasing than @xmath104 in this region . for @xmath105 the spectral slope is again @xmath106 .",
    "reality will be some combination of these histories .",
    "we therefore expect the cosmological spectrum we calculate later ( section [ sec : cosmocalc ] ) to be composed of a superposition of curves of these shapes , modified for chirp mass variations , redshift effects and time delay between progenitor star formation and dd formation .",
    "the detailed calculations described in following sections follow in detail the evolution of all sources from zams to merger , and do not rely upon approximate treatments of the kind given above .",
    "simple estimates of the background amplitude are discussed in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the rapid evolution code bse @xcite is used throughout this work whenever a binary system is evolved . this code is a fit to detailed models of stellar evolution , and produces an evolutionary time - sequence @xmath107 of the properties @xmath108 of any input zams binary system .",
    "the code s time - resolution adapts to the shortest current timescale for change of the system components and orbit , due to e.g. nuclear evolution , angular momentum loss or mass transfer , which are all treated iteratively and have finite duration . in this way , even the most fleeting of evolutionary phases",
    "is captured in detail , without requiring excessive time resolution during long phases in which little changes .",
    "this is especially useful in the study of gravitational waves , since the majority of the gw emission from a given system occurs over an inspiral timescale much shorter than the nuclear timescales of the binary s parent zams stars .",
    "some of the most relevant features of the bse code will be described in the following section ; see @xcite for full details .",
    "the output @xmath107 from the code can be used to construct a stellar population at time @xmath109 as follows .",
    "this method is similar to that used by @xcite to characterise the galactic binary population .",
    "we describe the zams binary parameter space in terms of the primary ( larger ) mass @xmath17 , secondary mass @xmath18 ( or mass ratio @xmath110 ) , orbital semi - major axis @xmath19 and orbital eccentricity @xmath25 .",
    "we divide this space into grid boxes , and from each box @xmath111 , we randomly choose a zams system to represent the evolution of all sources in that box .    the number @xmath112 of sources born into box @xmath111 per unit binary system realised is determined by probability distributions @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 in the zams system properties described above ( see section [ sec : candidates ] ) .",
    "@xmath112 is obtained by integrating the product of these distribution functions over the extent of box @xmath111 .",
    "we wish to construct the population of sources present at time @xmath109 . for each output timestep @xmath116 ,",
    "the system with properties @xmath107 can be viewed as a system born between times @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "if at this point the star formation rate was @xmath119 ( expressed as a number of binary systems born per unit time ) , then the number of systems with properties @xmath107 we expect to see at time @xmath109 is given by @xmath120 so long as @xmath121 , so that stars were not born before time began .",
    "we perform this calculation for all boxes @xmath111 and all timesteps @xmath122 , so that the total population at time @xmath109 is given by the combination of all @xmath123 .",
    "this method of population synthesis ensures that sources from even unlikely regions of zams parameter space are represented , weighted by their low formation probability .",
    "coupled with the adaptive time - resolution of the bse output , and a sufficiently fine grid spacing , this technique allows the synthesis of a statistically reasonable population in a modest amount of computing time .",
    "alternatively , statistical accuracy can be ensured with a monte carlo approach by simply generating a large enough number of stars under the initial distribution functions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our grid extends from 0.08 to 20 m@xmath86 in the mass of the primary @xmath17 , and from 0.08 m@xmath86 to @xmath17 in the secondary s mass .",
    "the initial separation is gridded from @xmath124 to @xmath125 , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the zams radii of the primary and secondary respectively .",
    "we find that our background fluxes are statistically accurate to around one per cent if we choose grid spacings of 0.05 in @xmath128 for each mass and 0.1 in @xmath129 for the separation .",
    "this corresponds to evolving @xmath130 binaries . for the galactic tests described in section [ sec : candidates ] we find that it is sufficient to use a grid spacing twice as large in each dimension .",
    "the bse code has previously been tested against various galactic populations of binary stars @xcite .",
    "a set of input parameters and distributions is recommended for use with the code , to best reproduce the observed galactic binary population as a whole .",
    "however , in this work we are keen to quantify the effects of astrophysical uncertainties upon population synthesis calculations of the gw background , and so in the following subsections we construct a set of models which differ in their choice of input parameters but produce specifically a galactic dd population not in conflict with observations .",
    "the current observational uncertainties about dds admit a range of models .",
    "this set of models is then considered representative of the population synthesis uncertainties affecting the gw background .",
    "the observations of dd stars are currently undergoing a revolution .",
    "full results of this revolution have not yet been published , so the detailed comparison of synthesised populations with observations is still difficult .",
    "@xcite reported on the 15 then known dds with measured periods , six of which had measured component mass ratios @xcite .",
    "searches for dds have mainly focussed on low - mass wds , @xmath131 ( e.g. @xcite ) , since these must have formed through giant stars losing their envelopes in binary systems , before the helium burning that would inevitably occur in a single star .",
    "@xcite determined that the fraction of dds among these da wds is between 1.7 and 19 per cent , with 95 per cent confidence .",
    "statistical comparisons with population synthesis models are thus difficult , given the sample size and level of bias , but there are some notable disagreements between observations and theory that are not easily explained in terms of selection effects .",
    "the first of these is the lack of observed very low mass he wds ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "theory predicts an abundance of such sources .",
    "@xcite suggest that this can be explained by a more rapid cooling law for low - mass wds than is commonly used .",
    "the second discrepancy is in the distribution of known dd mass ratios , which is seen to peak near unity @xcite . even considering selection effects",
    "@xcite , this is difficult to explain in terms of either standard dd formation route , since as described in section [ sec : evol ] , the wd masses are expected to differ significantly .",
    "this prompted @xcite to suggest an alternative scenario in which a common envelope phase between a giant and a main sequence star of similar mass does not result in a substantial spiral - in of the orbit , meaning that the second common envelope phase does not occur until the secondary s radius is larger ( relative to that of the primary when it filled its own roche lobe ) than in the standard cee+cee picture , so that the second wd formed is more massive , closer to the mass of the first - formed wd .",
    "they motivate this choice by parametrizing in terms of an angular momentum , rather than an energy balance ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : evol ] ) .",
    "the observational sample of dds is currently being substantially increased by the spy project @xcite , a spectroscopic study of @xmath133 apparently single wds ( not restricted to low mass ) to search for radial velocity variations indicative of binarity .",
    "@xcite report that of the 558 wds surveyed so far , 90 ( 16 per cent ) show evidence for a close wd companion . of these ,",
    "mass ratio determinations are reported for three dds @xcite , these three continuing the observed trend of mass ratios near unity .",
    "the results of the spy project , once analysed fully , will help to constrain dd population synthesis calculations in a greatly improved way .",
    "however , given the preliminary and partial nature of the results so far , we can make only rather broad statements about their compatibility with any given synthesised galactic population .",
    "this process is described in the next section .",
    "our fiducial population synthesis model ( model a ) is similar to the preferred model suggested by @xcite ( also his model a ) : we use the initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite ( ktg ) for @xmath134 , we distribute @xmath18 uniformly in the mass ratio @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and we start with a flat distribution in @xmath79 , choosing our limits as @xmath137 , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the zams radii of the primary and secondary respectively .",
    "we have tidal effects switched ` on ' , we use @xmath138 for the common envelope efficiency parameter , and we assign all stars solar metallicity , @xmath139 . for the galaxy , we adopt the constant star formation rate @xmath140 over the past 10 gyr which gives a stellar disk mass of @xmath141 today .",
    "we differ from hurley s model a in three main ways : first , we assign an initial binary fraction of 50 per cent ( cf .",
    "hurley s 100 per cent ) since this is observed locally to be the case @xcite and we evolve a set of single stars alongside the binaries , distributed according to the same imf as the binary primaries .",
    "second , we assign a zams orbital eccentricity @xmath25 to all systems , according to a thermal distribution @xmath142 .",
    "@xcite finds that an @xmath143 model gives a somewhat better fit to observations ( though he finds that the numbers of _ close _ ( @xmath144 d ) dd systems produced are not affected ) ; we will also test a model of this type as part of our parameter variation ( see below ) .",
    "lastly , hurley s model a assumed the envelope binding energy parameter @xmath145 for all stars , whereas here we allow this parameter to be calculated in the code ( values of @xmath52 are from fits to detailed models of stellar evolution by o. pols and are an addition to the code described in @xcite ; j. hurley , private communication , 2003 ) , and in addition we include 50 per cent of the envelope s ionisation energy in its binding energy .",
    "we test our synthesised galactic populations against observations in a necessarily simple way .",
    "the aim is to reject models in clear conflict with the observed population of double degenerate stars , and to admit all others as representative of the uncertainties in dd population synthesis .",
    "since the overall normalisation for the cosmological integral will be entirely separate from that used for the galaxy , we choose primarily to compare relative populations as opposed to absolute numbers of galactic sources .",
    "an ideal criterion is the fraction among field wds of close dd binaries , which currently available spy results place at 16 per cent .",
    "since the sample size is substantially larger than that of @xcite , we adopt the spy data , despite their incompleteness .",
    "we assume a negligible false - positive rate for spy , and approximate the survey as magnitude - limited ( @xmath146 ) for the purposes of comparison .",
    "the somewhat approximate galactic model and star formation history used here are sufficient , given the generosity of our selection criteria and the fact that we compare fractional quantities wherever possible .",
    "we distribute all stars according to a simple double exponential galactic disk model ( scale height 200 pc , scale radius 2.5 kpc ) , then calculate the fraction of wds with @xmath146 expected to be members of dd binaries with @xmath147 d. we then require that this calculated fraction be at least 10 per cent , if a given model is to be accepted .",
    "we assign a lower limit only , since our calculated binary fractions are likely to be overestimates , for several reasons .",
    "first , 100 d is a generous upper limit to the orbital periods detectable with spy ; second , we do not address the issue of the substantial lack of observed low - mass ( hence binary - member ) wds found in other population synthesis studies ; and finally , the cooling curves used are the simple mestel curves from @xcite ; if we instead use the ` modified mestel cooling ' from @xcite , which better fits the theoretical curves of @xcite , then our calculated binary fraction decreases by a few percent . for our fiducial model",
    "a , with @xcite cooling , we find that 18 per cent of field wds will show up as dds in such a survey , in reasonable agreement with the spy results .",
    "we also find a local total space density of wds of @xmath148 , and compare this with observational values , which range from @xmath149 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we do not attempt to compare to distributions in mass , mass ratio or period in detail : the observed distributions are subject to complex selection effects , and turn out often to be most constraining for wd cooling models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose development is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we note however that in a volume - limited sense , the mean mass ratio ( where @xmath150 by definition ) for detached wd  wd pairs is @xmath151 , not in good agreement with observations , but in common with other studies .",
    "we then go on to consider adjustments to our model , varying the initial distributions and mass transfer prescriptions . in all respects other than those mentioned below ,",
    "these models are identical to model a.    in models b , c and d , we use common envelope efficiency parameters @xmath55 of 1.0 , 2.0 and 4.0 respectively , while model e uses the angular momentum formalism proposed by @xcite for the first phase of spiral in , with their recommended value of @xmath152 , and with @xmath153 .    in models",
    "n , o , p and w , we also perturb the common envelope phase . in model",
    "n , we include all of the envelope s ionisation energy ( a positive quantity corresponding to the energy released when the ionised part of the envelope recombines ) in its binding energy , meaning that envelopes will be less strongly bound and hence their removal will require less orbital shrinkage .",
    "this effect becomes important for stars on the agb .",
    "model o , on the other hand , does not include any of the ionisation energy .",
    "determinations of @xmath52 from stellar modelling are found to depend on the definition of the core - envelope boundary @xcite in giant stars . because of this uncertainty , we also evolve models w and p in which we fix @xmath145 , with @xmath154 and @xmath155 , respectively .    in model f , we choose the primary mass from the imf of @xcite , as in @xcite .",
    "then in model g we select both @xmath17 and @xmath18 independently from the ktg imf , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we also evolve a model k , in which initial orbital eccentricities are set to zero .",
    "models l and m alter the production of dds via the rlof+cee route described in section [ sec : evol ] .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that roche lobe overflow may be stable until later in the hertzsprung gap ( hg ) than happens using the bse code , so a model with enhanced hg overflow was added ( model l ) .",
    "model m has semiconservative overflow during this stage , to emphasise the uncertainties associated with hg mass transfer .    the galactic dd population was simulated using each model in turn ; the results of this exercise are summarised in table [ tab : gal_models ] . imposing the criterion given above ,",
    "we eliminate models b , g and w based on their under - production of dds .",
    "if we increase the binary fraction to 100 per cent , this tends to under - produce single wds , leading to an especially high dd fraction and a low overall wd space density .",
    "note that the table also contains a model h , which is in agreement with observations and is described in the next section .",
    "thus the models a , c , d , e , f , h , k , l , m , n , o and p progress to the next round , as representative of reasonable astrophysical uncertainties in our population synthesis calculations .",
    "three further models are added later ( section [ sec : csfh ] ) ; these vary in their cosmic star formation and metallicity histories , and so can not be tested against the galactic dd population .",

    "our use of the terms ` optimistic ' and ` pessimistic ' assumes that this background constitutes signal for the reader ; if it constitutes a noise , the nomenclature should be reversed .",
    "* optimistic model : * this has the properties of model a , except for : the @xcite common envelope formalism , initially circular orbits , enhanced mass transfer on the hg , edge lit detonations only after accretion of 0.3 m@xmath86 and no ionisation energy in envelope binding energies used for common envelope phases .",
    "note that some of these individually boosting effects do not make a double - boost in combination ; for example the no spiral - in common envelope prescription tends to lead to dd mass ratios closer to unity , which means that fewer systems undergo stable mass transfer upon contact , and so the enhancement brought by the higher eld limit is less effective in increasing the amplitude of the background .",
    "we also include the estimated error on our overall normalisation ( see section [ sec : csfh ] ) , by using a cosmic star formation rate everywhere 30 per cent higher than our fiducial one .    * pessimistic model : * the pessimistic model contains the elements found in the previous section to decrease the amplitude of the gw background .",
    "the properties of this model are thus the same as model a , except for : @xmath160 , roche lobe overflow is semiconservative on the hg , the scalo initial mass function is used and 100 per cent of the ionisation energy is included in the envelope binding energies used in common envelope phases .",
    "in addition , we use a star formation rate everywhere 30 per cent lower than our fiducial one , in our cosmological integral .",
    "these prescriptions were used to create galactic dd populations , which were found to compare reasonably with observations . then the cosmological integrals were carried out for each .",

    "this result is in clear disagreement with our findings , but this can be explained by noting that their ratio is artificially raised by a number of factors : first , the fiducial scalings of @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 in their eq .",

    "lastly , the cosmic star formation rate adopted was not normalised to any integral constraint , but merely to the current star formation rate .",

    "this lies a factor two outside of our predicted range for the background .",
    "the discrepancy can be understood mainly in terms of their different method of normalisation : they normalised to the local core collapse supernova rate , and used the steep scalo imf , meaning that more low- and intermediate - mass stars were born in their simulations than measured by @xcite . as explained in section [ sec : csfh ] , we believe that normalising to an integral constraint on the birth of low - mass stars is a more robust method .",

    "this type of feature is difficult to explain in terms of the arguments in section [ sec : anal ] , unless the vast majority of wd  wd pairs are born precisely into this ` bump ' , which seems unlikely , since the same feature is seen for all types of compact object pair ( e.g. ns  ns , ns ",

    "2 .   dominated by double white dwarf binaries for @xmath172hz .    concentrating on the spectrum around @xmath173  mhz :    1 .",
    "the fraction of critical density in gravitational waves received in the logarithmic frequency interval around 1 mhz lies in the range @xmath174 , with the most likely value in the range @xmath175 .",
    "the flux - weighted mean chirp mass of the contributing binaries is @xmath176 .",
    "half of the background comes from binaries whose more massive ( primary ) star had a mass in the range 24 @xmath177 ( and @xmath1570 per cent from primaries originally less massive than 4 m@xmath86 ) .",
    "the estimate of the background is thus more robust to uncertainties in the imf and mass cuts if normalised to the present density of starlight than if normalised to core - collapse supernova rates .",
    "4 .   @xmath178 per cent of the gw signal is from binaries with initial semi - major axes in the range of 301000 stellar diameters , in which the roche contact of both primary and secondary stars led to unstable transfer and a common envelope .",
    "the background level produced by these systems is quite stable against uncertainties in the efficiency of the common envelope phase , though the signal can be changed somewhat through use of a non - standard common envelope prescription .",
    "@xmath179 per cent of the gw flux comes from systems descended from binaries with initial semi - major axes of about 5 stellar diameters , in which the first roche contact occurred in the hertzsprung gap , with stable overflow , but the second roche contact led to unstable transfer and a common envelope .",
    "the background level produced by these systems is sensitive to uncertainties in common envelope and mass transfer physics .",
