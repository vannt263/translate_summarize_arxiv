    "two level quantum systems that undergo avoided level crossing play an important role in physics .",
    "often they provide not only a qualitative description of system properties but also a quantitative one . the possibility for a successful two level approximation arises in different physical systems , e.g. , a single one - half spin ; an atom placed in a resonant light ; smallest quantum magnets ; etc .",
    "in this paper we focus on avoided level crossing dynamics in two level quantum systems . two interesting related extensions of above mentioned long list are the critical dynamics of quantum phase transitions @xcite and adiabatic quantum computing @xcite . in both of these cases ( and , indeed , in all of the other applications of the avoided level crossing scenario ) there are many more than two levels , but the essence of the problem can be still captured by the two level , landau - zener type , calculation .",
    "our interest in landau - zener model originates also from its well known numerous applications to different physical systems . in many cases",
    "there is a possibility of more general dependence of the relevant parameters ( i.e. gap between the two levels on time ) than in the original landau - zener treatment .",
    "this motivates our extensions in this paper of the level crossing dynamics to asymmetric level crossings and various power - law dependences .",
    "appropriate variations of external parameters driving landau - zener transition can allow for an experimental realization of these generalized landau - zener like models in quantum magnets @xcite and optical lattices @xcite .",
    "we focus on evolutions that include both adiabatic and diabatic ( impulse ) regime during a single sweep of a system parameter . for simplicity ,",
    "we call these evolutions diabatic since we assume that they include a period of fast change of a system parameter .",
    "this is in contrast to adiabatic time evolutions induced by very slow parameter changes when the system never leaves adiabatic regime .",
    "we will use a formalism proposed recently by one of us @xcite .",
    "it originates from the so - called kibble - zurek ( kz ) theory of topological defect production in the course of classical phase transitions @xcite , and works best for two level systems .",
    "the two level approximation was recently shown by zurek _",
    "et al _ @xcite and dziarmaga @xcite to be useful in studies of quantum phase transitions confirming earlier expectations  see chap .",
    "1.1 of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the formalism presented here will provide a link between dynamical studies of classical and quantum phase transitions .",
    "the present contribution extends the ideas presented in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have succeeded in replacing the fit to numerics used there for getting a free parameter of the theory , with a simple analytic calculation .",
    "we also show that the method of @xcite can be successfully applied to a large class of two level systems .",
    "moreover , we present nontrivial exact analytic solutions for landau - zener model and the relevant adiabatic - impulse approximations not published to date .",
    "section [ aia ] presents basics of what we call the adiabatic - impulse approximation .",
    "section [ lz ] shows adiabatic - impulse , diabatic and finally exact solutions to different versions of the landau - zener problem . in section [ 2n ]",
    "we discuss solutions for a whole class of two level systems on the basis of adiabatic - impulse and diabatic schemes .",
    "section [ ising ] presents how results of section [ lz ] can be used to study quantum ising model dynamics .",
    "details of analytic calculations are in appendix [ a_l ] ( diabatic solutions ) , appendix [ a_lz ] ( exact solutions of landau - zener problems ) and appendix [ a_r ] ( adiabatic - impulse solution from sec .",
    "we will study dynamics of quantum systems by assuming that it includes _ adiabatic _ ( no population transfer between instantaneous energy eigenstates ) , and _ impulse _ ( no changes in the wave function except for an overall phase factor ) stages only .",
    "the nature of this approach suggests the name _ adiabatic - impulse _ ( ai ) approximation .",
    "the ai approach originates from the kibble - zurek ( kz ) theory of nonequilibrium classical phase transitions and we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion of ai - kz connections .",
    "below , we summarize basic ideas of the kz theory , and the relevant assumptions used later on .",
    "second order phase transitions and avoided level crossings share one key distinguishing characteristic : in both cases sufficiently near the critical point ( defined by the relaxation time or by the inverse of the size of the gap between the two levels ) system `` reflexes '' become very bad . in phase transitions",
    "this is known as `` critical slowing down '' .    in the treatment of the second order phase transitions",
    "this leads to the behavior where the state of the system can initially  in the adiabatic region far away from the transition  adjust to the change of the relevant parameter that induces the transition , but sufficiently close to the critical point its reflexes become too slow for it to react at all . as a consequence , a sequence of three regimes ( adiabatic , impulse near the critical point , and adiabatic again on the other side of the transition )",
    "can be anticipated . in the second order phase transitions",
    "this allows one to employ a configuration dominated by the pre - transition fluctuations to calculate salient features of the post - transition state of the order parameter ( e.g. , the density of topological defects ) .",
    "key predictions of this kz mechanism have been by now verified in numerical simulations @xcite and more importantly in the laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "the crux of this story is of course the moments when the transition from adiabatic to impulse and back to adiabatic behavior takes place . assuming that the transition point is crossed at time @xmath0",
    ", this must happen around the instants @xmath1 , where @xmath2 equals system relaxation time @xmath3 @xcite . as the relaxation time depends on system parameter @xmath4 , which is changed as a function of time ,",
    "one can write @xmath5 this basic equation proposed in @xcite can be solved when dependence of @xmath3 on some measure of the distance from the critical point ( e.g. , relative temperature or coupling @xmath4 ) is known .",
    "assuming , e.g. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , the  quench time \" , contains information about how fast the system is driven through the transition , one arrives at @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the time @xmath10 at which the behavior switches between approximately adiabatic and approximately impulse is @xmath11 .",
    "once this last  adiabatic \" instant in the evolution of the system is known , interesting features of the post transition state ( such as the size of the regions @xmath12 in which the order parameter is smooth ) can be computed .",
    "generalization to other universality classes is straightforward @xcite and leads to @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are universal critical exponents ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in what follows",
    "we adopt this approach to quantum systems where dynamics can be approximated as an avoided level crossing ( see fig .",
    "[ gapanty ] ) . for simplicity we restrict ourselves to two - level systems that possess a single anti - crossing ( fig .",
    "[ gapanty ] ) in the excitation spectrum and a gap preferably going to @xmath16 far away from the anti - crossing .",
    "the latter condition guarantees that asymptotically the system enters adiabatic regime .",
    "the passage through avoided level crossing can be divided into an adiabatic and an impulse regime according to the size of the gap in comparison with the energy scale that characterizes the rate of the imposed changes in system hamiltonian .",
    "if the gap is large enough the system is in adiabatic regime , while when the gap is small it undergoes impulse time evolution as depicted in fig .",
    "[ gapanty](b ) .",
    "the instants @xmath17 are supposed to be such that the discrepancy between time dependent exact results and those coming from splitting of the evolution into only adiabatic and impulse parts is minimized . therefore , the ai approximation looks like a _ time dependent variational method _ where @xmath10 is a variational parameter while adiabatic - impulse assumptions provide a form of a variational wave function .    to make sure that assumptions behind the ai approach are correctly understood , let s consider time evolution of the system depicted in fig .",
    "[ gapanty ] .",
    "let the evolution start at @xmath18 from a ground state ( gs ) and last till @xmath19 .",

    "( [ bodzik ] ) leads to correct results in the lowest nontrivial order .",
    "this method , illustrated on specific examples in appendix [ a_l ] , is based on the observation that a time dependent schrdinger equation can be solved exactly in the diabatic limit if one looks at the lowest nontrivial terms in expressions for excitation amplitudes .",

    "in this section we illustrate the ai approximation by considering the landau - zener model . in this way we supplement and extend the results of @xcite .",

    "as the system undergoes slow evolution it is safe to assume that only long wavelength modes are excited , which means that @xmath160 are of interest .",
    "this allows to approximate @xmath161 and @xmath162 , which implies that ( [ pk ] ) turns into @xmath163 and that @xmath164 with @xmath165 .",
    "since @xmath166 $ ] corresponds to the above mentioned ( i ) case , @xmath167 , the ai approximation says that @xmath168 .",
    "initial conditions ( [ ukvk ] ) mean that the system starts time evolution at @xmath169 from _ excited _ state and we are interested in probability of finding it in the _ ground _ state at @xmath142 . elementary algebra based on ai approximation shows that this probability equals @xmath170 therefore , it is provided by ( [ infty ] ) and ( [ infty_ful ] ) . for any fixed @xmath171 consistent with lowest order approximation of @xmath172 and @xmath173 one gets @xmath174 where the prefactor , was found from expansion of the integral into @xmath175 adiabatic series with @xmath176 at fixed @xmath171 .",
    "in the derivation of this result @xmath177 in the expression for @xmath8 was approximated by @xmath178 .",
    "first of all , the prediction ( [ n_final ] ) provides correct scaling of defect density with @xmath75 .",
    "the prefactor , @xmath179 , has to be compared to @xmath180 ( exact result from @xcite and numerical estimation from @xcite ) or @xmath181 ( approximate result from @xcite ) .",
    "our prefactor matches these results remarkably closely concerning simplicity of the whole ai approximation .",
    "slight overestimation of the prefactor in comparison to exact result comes from the fact that ai transition probability , eq .",
    "( [ infty_ful ] ) , overestimates the exact result , eq .",
    "( [ dupa987 ] ) , for large @xmath8 s ( fig .",
    "[ dupa123 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting , to note that in the kibble - zurek scheme used for description of classical phase transitions an overestimation of defect density is usually of the order of @xmath182 @xcite , while here discrepancy is smaller than @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the ai approximation provides us with two predictions concerning dynamics of the quantum ising model : ( i ) it estimates when evolution ends in the asymptotic limit ; ( ii ) it correctly predicts scaling exponent and number of defects produced during adiabatic transitions .",
    "the part ( ii ) can be calculated exactly in the quantum ising model ( [ his ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , in other systems undergoing quantum phase transition the two level simplification might be too difficult for exact analytic treatment , e.g. , as in the system governed by ( [ h2n ] )",
    ". then the ai analysis might be the only analytic approach working beyond the lowest order diabatic expansion . besides that the ai approach provides us with a quite intuitive description of system dynamics , which is of interest in its own .",
    "especially , when one looks at connections between classical and quantum phase transitions .",
    "we have shown that the adiabatic - impulse approximation , based on the ideas underlying kibble - zurek mechanism @xcite , provides good quantitative predictions concerning diabatic dynamics of two level landau - zener like systems .",
    "after supplementing the splitting of the evolution into adiabatic and impulse regimes by the exact lowest order diabatic calculation , the whole approach is complete and can be in principle applied to different systems possessing anti - crossings , e.g. , those lacking exact analytic solution as the model ( [ h2n ] ) .",
    "we expect that the ai approach will provide the link between dynamics of classical and quantum phase transition thanks to usage of the same terminology and similar assumptions .",
    "we also expect that different variations of the classic landau - zener system discussed in this paper can be experimentally realized in the setting where the sweep rate can be manipulated .",
    "indeed , the model ( [ h2n ] ) arises once a proper nonlinear change of external system parameter is performed .",
    "the experimental access to studies of nonsymmetric landau - zener model can be obtained by change of the sweep rate after passing an anti - crossing center .",
    "the case of evolution starting from or ending at the anticrossing center can also be subjected to experimental investigations , e.g. , in a beautiful system consisting of the smallest available quantum magnets ( cold fe@xmath183 clusters ) @xcite .",
