    "the progressing energy turnaround in europe has one designated goal : reducing the dependence on fossil energy and thus , increasing the fraction of energy production that is obtained from renewable sources .",
    "other renewables like solar power or geothermal power aside , wind power is the most successful one , in terms of installed capacity as well as in the aggregated amount of power production .",
    "contrary to fossil power however , wind power production is erratic and non - deterministic .",
    "thus , accurate predictions are crucial for efficient market clearing as well as network dispatching , as @xcite and @xcite point out .",
    "short- to medium - term wind power forecasting ( up to one day ) is a wide field of research .",
    "these predictions are usually carried out by stochastic approaches , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "+ wind power prediction depends basically on wind speed predictions .",
    "however , wind power forecasting is a task on its own , i.e. power production depends on the turbine type , among other things , as @xcite indicate .",
    "wind speed prediction models have been under constant development and improvement during the recent decade , at least .",
    "early work is done by @xcite .",
    "they propose a long - memory autoregressive moving average model for wind speed .",
    "@xcite investigate heteroscedasticity of high frequency data ( 15-minute observation frequency ) .",
    "thus , @xcite and @xcite apply an arfima - garch model ( autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity ) with a seasonal component in the explanatory variables .",
    "+ instead of univariate processes , more recently , researchers exploit spatial information of the data , as weather stations are available at close proximity to each other in many cases .",
    "@xcite develop a spatial regime - switching model .",
    "furthermore , @xcite provide an extended regime - switching approach .",
    "@xcite model the spatial dependence of the daily wind speed by a gaussian random field .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigate the spatial structure of the data as well .",
    "+ in this paper we come up with a very general and flexible model that uses spatial wind speed , wind direction , temperature and air pressure data .",
    "the interaction of the data is modelled by a periodic vector autoregressive model ( svar ) with explanatory variables ( referred to as `` x '' ) , which are , in our case , just several periodic regressors .",
    "contrary to classical fourier modeling for the periodicity , we use more flexible b - splines",
    ". the heteroscedastic variance is modelled by a threshold autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity ( tarch ) model , also with explanatory variables ( which are again , in our case , periodic regressors ) . in the end ,",
    "our model is an svarx - tarchx model with adaptive lag selection . due to the huge parameter space , classical maximum likelihood ( ml )",
    "estimation would consume a lot of computing time .",
    "instead , we use the popular shrinkage methodology , applied by means of the elastic net ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and lasso ( least absolute selection and shrinkage operator ) method ( see * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite use the lasso and several other empirical models to enhance the forecasting performance of a wind farm .",
    "the lasso and the elastic net are efficient ways to perform model selection and model fitting in one step .",
    "these algorithms operate quite fast and do not require any distributional assumption .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed an iteratively re - weighted lasso method which incorporates heteroscedasticity within the variance part .",
    "+ we apply our model to a data set that consists of seven weather stations in germany . the stations record weather data at a frequency of ten minutes . per station , we have three full sample years , i.e. roughly 158,000 observations . with this data set , we calculate forecasts from our model and from several benchmark models , i.e. the persistence model , an ar , a var model and an arfima - aparch model ( arfima with asymmetric power generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity ) , as applied by @xcite .",

    ". finally , section [ section : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "the spatial area of investigated wind speed data is shown in figure [ figure : brand ] . in this article",
    "we focus on the most central station lindenberg [ 5 ] .",
    "we use mncheberg [ 2 ] as a reference station and for spatial information , also use its neighbours .",
    "they are situated in eastern germany in a region of rural plains .",
    "this region is perfect for wind parks .",
    "the data is measured by the `` deutscher wetterdienst '' ( dwd ) and reaches from january 2009 to december 2011 . for model",

    "figure [ figure : stat ] shows the wind speed data , the corresponding histogram and the autocorrelation function ( acf ) for stations lindenberg and mncheberg .",
    "the observed wind speed possesses strong ( conditional ) volatility and the histogram of the wind speed shows a non - negative and positively skewed distribution .",
    "moreover , we observe the presence of autocorrelation , which is related to the high frequency of the wind speed data .",
    "the autocorrelation function shows periodic characteristics . to investigate the periods , we calculate the smoothed periodogram , which is given in figure [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the peaks in this picture depict a periodic behavior for several frequencies , which correspond to diurnal @xmath7 and annual @xmath8 periods ( note that at a data frequency of 10 minutes , there are 144 obs./day and 52,560 obs./year ) .",
    "we observe autocorrelation , a periodic behavior and heteroscedasticity , just as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .         according to the fact that wind speed is a spatial phenomenon ,",
    "it is reasonable to include the available and relevant information of neighbouring measurement stations .",
    "we will emphasize this idea with an example .",
    "if the wind is blowing from the north to the south and we observe this information at station mncheberg , we are able to use this information for the station lindenberg ( cf .",
    "figure [ figure : brand ] ) . if the wind comes from the south , we can consider the observations from cottbus . the investigated area of our data set contains seven different stations and lindenberg is the midpoint .",

    "it can be seen that aside from six exceptions , all correlation coefficients are significant , but some are close to zero .",
    "mncheberg s air pressure is barely correlated to any of the other variables .",
    "each station s temperature data is strongly positively correlated to each other station s temperature data .",
    "the same holds for the wind direction .",
    "the correlation between most groups of different types of variables is weak .",
    "temperature and wind speed are weakly negatively correlated , wind speed and air pressure are somewhat stronger positively correlated .",
    "eventually , we observe a huge positive correlation between the wind direction and the wind speed , which will be captured by our new multivariate model .",
    "figure [ figure : rose5 ] depicts the wind rose for our target station lindenberg ( left panel ) .",
    "wind roses show the densities of wind speeds , dependent on the wind direction . as the wind speed densities are rather large for eastern , north - eastern and south - eastern directions ,",
    "we conclude that lindenberg is mostly affected by winds coming from directions at which baruth , doberlug - kirchhain and possibly berlin - schnefeld are located .",
    "accordingly , figure [ figure : rose5 ] shows the wind rose for station mncheberg on the right panel .",
    "univariate wind speed models are based on a decomposition of the time series into a time - dependent intercept , a trend component and a seasonal part .",

    "we include periodic b - splines instead of fourier series to capture periodicity / seasonality . the intercept and the seasonal components are modelled by @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are up to @xmath16 and @xmath17 time dependent periodic functions .",
