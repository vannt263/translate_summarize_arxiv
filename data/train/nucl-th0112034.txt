    "we expect a steeper increase in the @xmath119 case since @xmath121 is decreasing , see fig.2 .",
    "= 6.5 cm    this is an interesting aspect to look at more in detail since it actually represents a general relativistic effect due to the coupling to scalar mesons .",
    "in some sense it is the equivalent , in the isovector channel ( @xmath122 ) , i.e. for the symmetry energy , of the saturation mechanism we have in the isoscalar channel ( @xmath123 ) for the symmetric matter .",
    "the scalar charged @xmath0-meson , like the neutral @xmath12 , is acting on the nucleon effective masses , introducing a @xmath9 splitting , see eq.(6 ) .",

    "in fact in a n - rich matter the neutron fermi momentum increases while the neutron effective mass decreases , see eq.(6 ) and fig.6 ( the opposite for protons ) .",
    "such negative @xmath0 contribution is reduced at high densities due to the `` lorentz contraction '' factor @xmath124 , eqs.(16 ) and ( 20 ) , that in general gives the attenuation of the scalar interactions with increasing baryon density .",
    "we stress the consistent picture of a symmetry energy built from the balance of scalar ( attractive ) and vector ( repulsive ) contributions , with the scalar channel becoming weaker with increasing baryon density .",
    "this is indeed the isovector counterpart of the saturation mechanism occurring in the isoscalar channel for the symmetric nuclear matter . from such scheme",
    "we get a further strong fundamental support for the introduction of the @xmath0-coupling in the symmetry energy evaluation .",

    "the crosses ( negative @xmath0 contribution ) follow a linear behaviour up to roughly @xmath13 and then they tend to saturate due to the lorentz contraction factor . in correspondence",
    "we will see the increase of the total @xmath89 shown in fig.2 .",
    "we note the accuracy of the approximate @xmath0 contribution given by eq.(20 ) , dashed line in fig.3 .    in fig.4",
    "we show the equation of state ( energy per nucleon ) for pure neutron matter ( @xmath126 ) obtained with the two parameter sets , i ( @xmath5 ) and ii ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the values are in good agreement with recent non - relativistic quantum - monte - carlo variational calculations with realistic @xmath128 and @xmath129body forces @xcite . the inclusion of the @xmath0-coupling leads to a larger repulsion at baryon densities roughly above @xmath130 .",

    "> from the first term of eq.(23 ) , with our parametrization , we get a potential contribution to @xmath132 of @xmath137 ( this is actually fixed by the @xmath82 value ) and a genuine @xmath0 extra contribution of about @xmath138 from the second term . when we include also the kinetic part ( from the first term of eq.(20 ) ) we have a total slope parameter going from @xmath139 to @xmath140 .",
    "we note again that the slope parameter , or equivalently the _ symmetry pressure _ @xmath141 , is of great importance for structure properties , being linked to the thickness of the neutron skin in n - rich ( stable and/or unstable ) nuclei @xcite , and to the assessment of the drip - line @xcite .",
    "moreover the same parameter gives an estimate of the shift of the saturation density with asymmetry ( at the lowest order in @xmath142 ) @xmath143 that can be easily obtained from a linear expansion around the symmetric value @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "eq.(24 ) has a simple physical meaning : in order to compensate the symmetry pressure in asymmetric matter we have to move the zero of the @xmath145 curve to lower densities .",
    "the amount of the shift will be inversely proportional to the slope , given by the incompressibility .",
    "= 6.0 cm    all that can be seen in fig.5 where we report the total pressure @xmath145 for various asymmetries , at zero temperature , in the two cases , @xmath5-meson only ( dashed lines ) and @xmath119 ( solid lines ) .",
    "it is instructive to perform a similar discussion for the curvature parameter @xmath133 , eq.(21 ) .",
    "now the potential contribution is _ exclusively _ given by the @xmath0-meson , with a definite positive sign , as we can see from the previous discussion .",
    "this will be a large effect on the total since the kinetic part is quite small @xcite .",
    "if we compare with non - relativistic effective parametrizations @xcite , when we add the @xmath0-meson we move from a linear to a roughly parabolic @xmath30-dependence of the symmetry energy .    with our parameters we pass from a @xmath146 ( only kinetic ) to a @xmath147 .",
    "so this quantity appears extremely interesting to look at experimentally , as recently suggested from reaction measurements @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the effect on the total incompressibility of asymmetric matter , that likely could be easier to measure , is not trivial .",
    "we can evaluate a shift of the incompressibility with asymmetry , at the same @xmath142 order as in eq.(24 ) , as @xcite @xmath148 so what really matters for the total incompressibility is the combination @xmath149 , with the possibility of a compensation between the two terms . just by chance",
    "this is actually what is happening in our calculations since for the above combination we get @xmath150 in the case of only @xmath5 coupling , and @xmath151 when we add also the @xmath0 .",
    "indeed we see from fig.5 that the slopes of the pressure around equilibrium density ( @xmath152 ) are very close in the two cases , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "another qualitative new result of the @xmath0-meson coupling is the @xmath9-effective mass splitting in asymmetric matter @xcite , see eq.(6 ) .",
    "in fig.6 we report the baryon density dependence of the @xmath9 effective masses for @xmath153 asymmetry , calculated with our set ii parameters , compared to the symmetric case @xcite .",
    "= 6.7 cm    we get a splitting of the order of @xmath154 at normal density @xmath13 , and increasing with baryon density . unfortunately from the present nuclear data we have a very small knowledge of this effect , due to the low asymmetries available .",
    "this issue will be quite relevant in the study of drip - line nuclei .",
    "moreover we can expect important effects on transport properties ( fast particle emission , collective flows ) of the dense and asymmetric @xmath85 that will be reached in radioactive beam collisions at intermediate energies",
    ".    the sign itself of the splitting would be very instructive . as we can see from eq.(6 ) in @xmath155-rich systems we expect a neutron effective mass always smaller than the proton one .",
    "the same is predicted from more microscopic relativistic dirac - brueckner calculations @xcite . at variance ,",
    "non - relativistic brueckner - hatree - fock calculations are leading to opposite conclusions @xcite . still in the non - relativistic picture",
    "quite contradictory results are obtained with the skyrme effective forces .",
    "the most recent parametrizations , sly - type @xcite , of skyrme forces give the proton effective mass above the neutron one , in agreement with our calculations .",
    "previous skyrme - like forces , instead , yield a splitting in the opposite direction , but also show unpleasant behaviours in the spin channel ( collapse of polarized neutron matter , see discussion in @xcite ) .    we like to note again that , as shown before , a decreasing neutron effective mass in @xmath155-rich matter is behind the relativistic mechanism for the symmetry energy , balance of scalar ( attractive ) and vector ( repulsive ) contributions in the isovector channel .      in the temperature range of interest in this paper , below the critical temperature @xmath156 of the liquid - gas phase transition , of the order of @xmath157 mev ( see fig.1 ) , temperature effects on the symmetry properties",
    "are not expected to be large . indeed the contributions of antifermions , that could modify all the terms with the scalar densities , see eq.(13 ) , are still very reduced . in fig.2",
    "we present also the symmetry energies calculated at @xmath158 , lower solid and dashed curves . for both cases , @xmath5 and @xmath119 the variation is quite small .",
    "we have a reduction mainly coming from the kinetic contribution due to the smoothing of the @xmath9 fermi distributions .",
    "we note that this result is in full agreement with relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock calculations @xcite .",
    "the effect is even smaller for the mass splitting , given by a difference of scalar densities . in the next section",
    "we will study in detail the phase diagram of heated asymmetric nuclear matter , focussing in particular on the instability regions .",
    "heavy - ion collisions can provide the possibility of studying equilibrated nuclear matter far away from normal conditions , i.e. to sample new regions of the @xmath85 phase diagram .",
    "in particular the process of multifragmentation allows to probe dilute nuclear matter at finite temperatures , where in the symmetric case , see fig.1 , we expect to see a phase transition of first order of liquid - gas type , as suggested from the very first equations of state built with effective interactions @xcite .",
    "the multifragmentation phenomenon may be interpreted as a signal of such a phase transition in a finite system , when the nuclear matter in the expansion phase enters the region of spinodal ( mechanical ) instability .",
    "nuclear matter is however a two - component system consisting of neutrons and protons : binary systems have more complicated phase diagrams due to the new concentration degree of freedom .",
    "in particular for asymmetric nuclear matter a qualitative new feature in the liquid - gas phase transition is expected , the onset of a coupling to chemical instabilities ( component separation ) that will show up in a novel nature of the unstable modes , the mixture of density and charge fluctuations leading to an isospin distillation effect @xcite .",
    "indeed equilibrium thermodynamics , as well as non - equilibrium kinetic considerations predict that an asymmetric system will separate into more symmetric larger fragments ( `` liquid '' ) and into neutron - rich light fragments ( `` gas '' ) .",
    "so the chemical instability can be investigated experimentally just by measuring the n / z ratio , or isospin content , of the fragments .",
    "since the effect is driven by the isospin dependent part of the nuclear equation of state , here we will look at the influence of the @xmath0 coupling on this new liquid - gas phase transition .    it is known that the stability condition of a two - component , @xmath15 , thermodynamical system is given by    @xmath159    where p is the pressure , @xmath160 is the proton chemical potential and @xmath161 the proton fraction @xmath162 , related to the asymmetry parameter @xmath163 .",

    "_ isoscalar _",
    "( total density ) @xmath165 and _ isovector _ ( concentration ) @xmath166 oscillations are not coupled and we have two separate conditions for instability @xmath167 _ mechanical _ , i.e. vs. density oscillations ( the spinodal region ) , and    @xmath168    _ chemical _ , i.e. vs. concentration oscillations .    in asymmetric matter the isoscalar and isovector modes are coupled and the two separate inequalities do not maintain anymore a physical meaning , in the sense that they not select the nature of the instability . inside the general condition eq.(26 ) the corresponding unstable modes are a mixing of density and concentration oscillations , very sensitive to the charge dependent part of the nuclear interaction in the various instability regions @xcite .    in dilute asymmetric @xmath85 ( n - rich )",
    "the normal unstable modes for all realistic effective interactions are still _ isoscalarlike _ , i.e. in phase @xmath15 oscillations but with a larger proton component @xcite .",
    "this leads to a more symmetric high density ( liquid ) phase everywhere under the instability line defined by eq.(26 ) and consequentely to a more neutron - rich gas ( _ isospin distillation _ ) .",
    "such `` chemical effect '' is driven by the increasing symmetry repulsion going from low density to roughly the saturation value and so it appears quite sensitive to the symmetry energy of the used effective interaction at subnuclear densities .",
    "it could provide a good opportunity to differentiate the various @xmath1 isospin dependences @xcite .",
    "in this section we study the effect of the @xmath0-coupling on the instability region given by eq.(26 ) in dilute asymmetric nuclear matter and on the structure of the corresponding unstable modes .",
    "we start from an identity valid for any binary thermodynamical system @xmath169 where @xmath170 , @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) are respectively neutron / proton chemical potentials and densities . from our knowledge of the chemical potential on each isotherm ,",
    "eq.(9 ) , we can easily compute the limits of the instability region in the @xmath173 plane for dilute asymmetric @xmath85 in the two choices , without and with the @xmath0 meson .",

    "we notice just a small reduction and a shift to the left ( lower densities ) of the whole region : this can be understood in terms of the larger symmetry repulsion , see fig.3 .",
    "= 6.7 cm    we can understand the relatively small @xmath0 effect on the stability border just remembering that for low densities , well below @xmath13 , the symmetry term has roughly the same linear behaviour in both @xmath118 and @xmath119 schemes , fixed by the @xmath82 parameter ( see the discussion after eq.(20 ) ) . only for very large asymmetries",
    "it appears relatively easier in the @xmath0 case to be in the stable liquid phase .",
    "a rather larger difference can be seen in the behaviour of the quantity eq.(26 ) inside the instability region .",
    "this is plotted in fig.8 for various asymmetries at zero temperature and in fig.9 at various temperatures for a fixed asymmetry @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "the solid curves ( with @xmath0-coupling ) are systematically above the dashed ones , signature of a weaker instability .",
    "= 6.7 cm    = 6.2 cm    in order to better understand the origin of such effect we study also the structure of the corresponding unstable modes .",
    "we follow the landau dispersion relation approach to small amplitude oscillations in fermi liquids @xcite . for a two component ( @xmath9 ) matter the interaction is characterized by the landau parameters @xmath178 defined as @xmath179 where @xmath180 represents the single particle level density at the fermi energy . at zero temperature it has the simple form @xmath181    in the symmetric case ( @xmath182 ) , the eqs.(27,28 ) correspond to the two pomeranchuk instability conditions @xmath183 > from the dispersion relations @xmath184 will give the properties of density ( isoscalar ) modes and @xmath185 of the concentration ( isovector ) modes .",
    "for asymmetric @xmath85 we have some corresponding generalized landau parameters @xmath186 which will characterize the new collective response ( respectively _ isoscalarlike _ and _ isovectorlike _ ) .",
    "they can be expressed as fixed combinations of the @xmath187 for each baryon density , asymmetry and temperature .",
    "this transformation is reducing eq.(29 ) to a `` diagonal '' form @xcite @xmath188    as already discussed in the unstable region of dilute asymmetric @xmath85 we have _ isoscalarlike _ unstable modes and so @xmath189 , while the combination @xmath190 will stay positive . in fig.10",
    "we report the full calculation of these two quantities in the unstable region at zero temperature , for asymmetry @xmath176 , with and without the @xmath0 coupling .",
    "= 6.5 cm    the @xmath0 meson is almost not affecting at all the unstable mode , given by the @xmath191 parameter , and so the limits of the instability region , for @xmath176 , are not changed ( see the figs.7,8,9 ) .",
    "we have a much larger effect on the @xmath192 parameter which describe `` stable '' _ isovectorlike _ modes , that actually can propagate as good zero - sound collective motions since @xmath193 .",
    "this can be expected from the isovector nature of the @xmath0-meson . > from here we get the main differences seen in figs.8,9 for the quantity eq.(26 ) inside the instability region , just using eq.(32 ) .    another interesting aspect of the comparison between fig.8 and fig.10 is the shift of the `` maximum instability '' density region . from the thermodynamical condition reported in fig.8 it seems that the largest instability ( the most negative value ) is around @xmath194 .",
    "in fact from fig.10 we see that the fastest unstable mode , corresponding to the most negative pomeranchuk condition for @xmath195 , is actually present for more dilute matter , around @xmath196 .",
    "this shows the importance of the linear response analysis .",
    "finally the fact that the @xmath0-coupling is mostly affecting the _ isovectorlike _ modes is of great interest for possible effects on the isovector giant dipole resonances studied around normal density within the @xmath4 approach in asymmetric systems .",
    "aim of this work has been to select genuine new effects on properties of the asymmetric nuclear matter due to the coupling to the charged @xmath0-scalar meson introduced in a minimal way in a phenomenological hadronic field theory .",
    "simple analytical results allow to clarify the interplay between the @xmath5 and @xmath0 isovector meson contributions .    with respect to the equation of state , when the @xmath0 is included",
    "the symmetry energy keeps an almost linear baryon density repulsive behaviour at sub - nuclear densities while it starts to move to a roughly parabolic trend above the saturation density @xmath13 .",
    "such effect comes directly from the general relativistic property of the weakening of the attractive scalar interactions at high density .",
    "it represents the equivalent in the isovector channel ( interplay of @xmath5 and @xmath0 contributions ) of the saturation mechanism of the symmetric @xmath85 ( interplay of @xmath17 and @xmath12 contributions ) .",
    "all that gives a further fundamental support to the introduction of the @xmath0-channel in the symmetry energy evaluation .",
    "such `` @xmath0 mechanism '' for the symmetry energy leads to a more repulsive @xmath1 for pure neutron matter at baryon densities roughly above @xmath197 .",
    "this is the region where transitions to different forms of nuclear matter are expected and so the result appears quite stimulating .",
    "we have shown in details that the new @xmath0 contributions are not negligible for the slope parameter around @xmath13 ( the _ symmetry pressure _ ) and absolutely essential for the curvature parameter ( symmetry incompressibility ) .",
    "the proton - neutron effective mass splitting is also directly given by the @xmath0 coupling and appears to be of the order of @xmath154 at normal nuclear density ( for a @xmath177 asymmetry ) .",
    "* neutron distributions in @xmath198rich nuclei ( stable and unstable ) , @xcite * assessment of drip - line stabilities @xcite * bulk densities and incompressibility modulus in asymmetric nuclei @xcite * transport properties in radioactive beam collisions at intermediate energies : dissipative mechanisms , fast nucleon emission , collective flows @xcite    effects on the new critical properties of warm @xmath2 , mixing of mechanical and chemical instabilities and isospin distillation , are also presented .",
    "the border of the instability regions as well as the nature of the unstable fluctuations in dilute asymmetric matter are not much affected . indeed in the low density region",
    "the symmetry energy has a very similar behaviour with and without the @xmath0 meson .",
    "this reduces the possibility of the observation of @xmath0-coupling effects from measurements of isospin effects in multifragmentation events in asymmetric heavy ion collisions .",
    "we note however that other fragment production mechanisms , like _ `` neck fragmentation '' _ , are expected to be very sensitive to the symmetry potential around normal density since clusters are now formed in regions in contact with the `` spectator '' matter @xcite .",
    "we can predict some interesting effects on this kind of events , that actually represent a quite large part of the fragment production cross section .",
    "> from the study of the @xmath0 influence on the landau parameters in the low baryon density region we note however an interesting effect on the collective response of asymmetric @xmath85 .",
    "while the unstable ( _ isoscalarlike _ ) modes are almost not modified , the _ isovectorlike _ ones , which appear to have a good stable zero - sound propagation , are quite sensitive to the introduction of the @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests some importance of the @xmath0 meson in the @xmath4 description of isovector giant resonances in asymmetric nuclei .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to add a comment on the limits of the hartree scheme used in this work , as well as in most @xmath4 calculations .",
    "indeed it is well known that exchange terms can give contributions in the isovector scalar channel also in absence of explicit @xmath0-couplings , see ref.@xcite and ref.s therein . the comparison with dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock results of ref.@xcite and some non - linear - hartree - fock calculations performed in @xcite , @xcite , are showing that an effective @xmath0 coupling parameter @xmath199 , almost constant in a wide density range , is well accounting for the fock term contributions .",
    "this makes us more confident on the reliability of the quantitative evaluation of the @xmath0 effects discussed in this paper .",
