    "hypergeometric systems also known as gkz systems were introduced in @xcite and @xcite as a far reaching generalisation of the gauss hypergeometric differential equation .",
    "they appear as a special family of @xmath0-modules and they have been first studied in the regular case .",
    "for example in @xcite the authors consider integral representations of the solutions of hypergeometric systems , at generic points of the space , which they call euler integrals . in the irregular or confluent case",
    ", a. adolphson considers in @xcite other integral representations of solutions which involve exponentials of polynomial functions and appropriate integration cycles . in this paper",
    "we develop new aspects in the irregular case namely the link between gevrey series solutions and holomorphic solutions in sectors following adolphson s approach .",
    "we want to materialise a gevrey series solution as an asymptotic expansion in a sector of such an integral solution .",
    "let us fix some notations : @xmath0 stands for the complex weyl algebra of order @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an integer .",
    "elements in @xmath0 are linear partial differential operators with polynomial coefficients .",
    "the polynomial ring @xmath3:={{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{c}}}}[\\partial_1,\\ldots,\\partial_n]$ ] is a subring of the weyl algebra @xmath0 , where the @xmath4 s represent the partial derivatives with respect to the variables in the space @xmath5 .",
    "the input data for a gkz system is a pair @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a vector in @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a matrix of rank @xmath10 whose @xmath11 column is @xmath12 .",
    "the toric ideal @xmath13 $ ] is the ideal generated by the family of binomials @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the ideal @xmath17 is a prime ideal and the krull dimension of the quotient ring @xmath18/i_a$ ] equals @xmath10 .",
    "following @xcite , the hypergeometric ideal associated with the pair @xmath6 is  : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath21 euler operator associated with the @xmath21 row of @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding hypergeometric @xmath0module ( or hypergeometric system ) is the quotient @xmath0module @xmath23 . in @xcite and",
    "@xcite it is proven that any hypergeometric @xmath0-module is holonomic . moreover ,",
    "a characterization of the regularity of @xmath24 is provided in the series of papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite : the holonomic @xmath0-module @xmath24 is regular if and only if the toric ideal @xmath17 is homogeneous for the standard grading in the polynomial ring @xmath18 $ ] . in particular",
    "the condition to be regular for @xmath24 is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "the concept of regularity has been studied first in the case of an ordinary differential equation given by an operator @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "regularity is characterised according to fuchs theorem by the nullity of the irregularity number , an invariant combinatorially defined from the newton polygon of @xmath27 . in @xcite",
    "b. malgrange proved that the irregularity is the dimension of the space of solutions at the origin of @xmath28 with values in the space @xmath29/\\cc\\{x\\}$ ] of formal power series modulo convergent ones .",
    "later j.p .",
    "ramis gave a refined version of this result in @xcite calculating the space of solutions of a given gevrey index again by using the newton polygon of the operator .",
    "the concept of irregularity in higher dimension is considerably more involved but generalizes the above results .",
    "let us consider the structure sheaf @xmath30 of a complex manifold @xmath31 , the sheaf of rings @xmath32 of linear differential operators with holomorphic coefficients on @xmath31 and denote @xmath33 the completion of @xmath30 along a smooth hypersurface @xmath34 . in @xcite z. mebkhout introduces for a holonomic @xmath32module @xmath35 its irregularity complex along @xmath34 , @xmath36 , and in @xcite the gevrey filtration of this complex is introduced and related to other invariants of the system , the algebraic slopes in the sense of y. laurent .",
    "in the case of hypergeometric @xmath0-modules the irregularity sheaves along coordinate subspaces , and gevrey series solutions are studied and described in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "beforehand a. adolphson @xcite gave a formula for the dimension of the space of holomorphic solutions at a generic point of the space and for a generic value of the parameter @xmath7 , and he also described integral representations of solutions of these confluent hypergeometric systems . in the non - confluent case an analogous dimension formula was previously given in @xcite . in @xcite a. esterov and k. takeuchi prove that these generic solution spaces are in fact completely described by integral representations along rapid decay cycles as introduced by m. hien in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we want to explore the more hidden link between these integral representations and the gevrey series solutions described in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we treat the case of a matrix with one row @xmath37 with @xmath38 a list of co - prime integers .",
    "this is the case where the integration cycles are paths , and as explained below the significant gevrey series are along the hyperplane @xmath39 .",
    "we prove that any gevrey series solution of the system can be obtained as the asymptotic expansion of an integral representation along a well chosen path .",
    "a specificity of the one row case is that the rank of the space of gevrey solutions is independent of @xmath7 and we can treat all the values of @xmath7 . for a generic @xmath7",
    "we only use the space of rapid decay cycles and for special values of @xmath7 , namely for @xmath40 we must add an exceptional path , without the rapid decay property .",
    "the method of the proof is to reduce the statement to the case of the matrix @xmath41 , using the fact that the restriction is compatible with being a gevrey solution as well as with taking integrals on a fixed path . in parallel",
    "we know by an argument using a gevrey version of cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem that the dimension of the gevrey solution space is @xmath42 @xcite . in the case @xmath41 the gevrey expansion is with respect to the second variable @xmath43 .",
    "its coefficients depend on the variable @xmath44 and are holomorphic in some sector depending on the chosen paths .",
    "the main issue is to choose carefully a number of paths of integration that yield a basis of the space of gevrey series solutions and share a common sector of convergence for these coefficients .",
    "this choice appears to be possible if we restrict the range in the argument of the variable @xmath43 around a given direction .",
    "here is a summary of the contents of this paper . in section 2",
    "general facts are given about gevrey series solutions following @xcite .",
    "in the case of a one row matrix we know that the characteristic variety of the hypergeometric system is the union @xmath45 of the zero section and of the conormal to the hypersurface @xmath46 .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to consider the irregularity sheaf and the germs of gevrey series solutions with respect to the hyperplane @xmath34 and at a generic point @xmath47 of @xmath34 .",
    "we recall from @xcite the description of a basis of the space of gevrey series solutions in terms of @xmath48-series and the proof that the dimension of this space is always equal to @xmath42 .",
    "we also describe its behaviour by the restriction operation which consists in omitting variables among @xmath49 . in section 3",
    "we recall the definition of hypergeometric integrals of exponential type and the fact that they are solutions of the system .",
    "it is a quite general fact that these solutions have an asymptotic expansion as a gevrey series with respect to the variable @xmath50 provided that we choose an integration path of rapid decay both for the function @xmath51 and for @xmath52 . at the beginning of section 4",
    "we prove that these expansions are gevrey series of order less than or equal to @xmath53    in the remainder of this section we prove the main result of this paper about realisation of these gevrey series as asymptotic expansion of integral solutions .",
    "first we treat in detail the case of dimension 2 and the last subsection consists in using various restriction operations on the integral that are compared to the analogue described in section 2 for the gevrey series . in a short",
    "last section we deduce from the previous results an explicit description of the germ of the irregularity sheaf along @xmath34 at a generic point .",
    "we get a family of integral with asymptotic expansions that yields as expected a basis of the space of classes of gevrey series solutions modulo convergent ones .",
