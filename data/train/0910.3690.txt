    "solar models are a corner stone of stellar astrophysics . the determination of the solar interior structure through helioseismology and , only a few years later , the discovery that neutrinos change flavor , gave spectacular confirmations of our ability to model the sun and , by extension , of other stars .",
    "however , a series of works starting with a redetermination of the photospheric oxygen solar abundance @xcite and finishing with a complete revision of solar abundances @xcite , led to a strong reduction in the overall metallicity of the sun driven by much lower cno and ne abundances than previously determined .",
    "soon after , solar models that adopted the new composition were shown to have an interior structure at odds with helioseismology determinations . since then , the so - called _ solar abundance problem _ has been in the spotlight of solar ( and stellar ) astrophysics . as nicely put by @xcite ,",
    "it represents the incompatibility between the best solar atmosphere and interior models available .",
    "the effects of the low metallicity in the solar interior has been widely discussed in the literature . among many other references , the reader can refer to @xcite and @xcite . some attempts to constrain the solar metallicity independently of photospheric measurements",
    "can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the connection between solar neutrinos and composition has also been discussed in different works , e.g. @xcite .",
    "possible modifications in the physical inputs of solar models have also been discussed in connection to the _ solar abundance problem_. the reader can refer to @xcite just to mention some relevant works .    in this article , we present a short review of the field and present new solar models that incorporate the most recent solar abundance determination by @xcite . in   [ sec : models ] we describe the main characteristics of the models used to obtain the core results presented here , including the different options for solar compositions we used .",
    "results are presented in   [ sec : results ] where helioseismology properties of the models and solar neutrino fluxes are discussed in the context of current observational and experimental data . in   [ sec : opac ] we go to some length in discussing radiative opacities as a possible solution to the abundance problem , including the effects of opacities in solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "we summarize in   [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "over the years , standard solar models have played a fundamental role in the development of stellar astrophysics as well as in the    most of the results presented here refer to solar models computed with the garstec stellar evolution code @xcite with modifications .",
    "some of the differences are : the nuclear energy generation routine is _",
    "exportenergy.f_jnb ] ; radiative opacities are those from the opacity project @xcite complemented at low temperatured by those from @xcite . unless stated otherwise , the equation of state ( eos ) is the revised version of opal .",
    "as it is usual practice in solar models , a 1  m@xmath0 stellar model is evolved from the pre - main sequence ( or zero age main sequence ) up to the solar system age ( which we take to be @xmath1=4.57  ; see appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "the solar model is forced to match the present day solar radius r@xmath0 and luminosity l@xmath0 and here we adopt the values @xmath2   @xmath3   respectively .",
    "the third condition for solar models is to match the present - day metal to hydrogen fraction @xmath4 in the solar photosphere .",
    "the models presented here have been computed for three different basic sets of solar abundances as follows :    * gs98 : abundances from @xcite where meteoritic abundances for refractories are adopted and @xmath5 , * ags05 : meteoritic ( for refractories ) abundances from @xcite give @xmath6 , * agss09 : meteoritic ( for refractories ) abundances from the most recent determination of solar abundances by @xcite for which @xmath7 .",
    "one additional model , agss09ph , has been computed with the photospheric abundances from @xcite for which @xmath8 .    .adopted solar chemical compositions .",
    "[ tab : compo ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     with the new @xcite abundances , neutrino fluxes are very similar to those from the ags05 model . in particular , for our preferred meteoritic scale , the only important differences between these two sets of abundances are the moderate increase in cno values that directly affect cno neutrino fluxes and the 0.09  dex increase in ne and the large ( 0.22  dex ) increase in ar .",
    "the last two elements have some influence on the central temperature of the models and are responsible for the differences in @xmath9b and @xmath10be fluxes between ags05 and agss09 models . finally , as in the previous section , we also present results for the agss09ph model .",
    "it is interesting because it illustrates how not only the overall metallicity of the model is important , but how relative abundances of elements matter as well . in particular , the larger fe abundance in the photospheric abundances account for most of the difference between the fluxes predicted for this model with respect to the agss09 model .",
    "the interested reader in how individual elements affect neutrino fluxes can refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most relevant results for solar neutrinos are summarized in figure  [ fig : neu ] .",
    "the top panel shows the @xmath9b and @xmath10be fluxes from the models and the experimental results from sno ( @xmath9b ) and borexino ( @xmath10be ) . in the case of sno results , because we still lack a joint analysis of the three different phases , we use the value @xmath11   for the flux , a weighed average of the three phases @xcite . in the case of borexino , the measured flux after only 192 days of data taking is @xmath12   @xcite .",
    "model uncertainties for the fluxes are taken from @xcite .",
    "as discussed in that work , current neutrino measurements slightly favor results of models with gs98 abundances over those with ags05 ( or agss09 ) .",
    "we note , however , that the gs98 and the agss09ph model are at the same level of agreement with helioseismology : gs98 predicts exactly the measured value for @xmath10be and differs from the sno value for @xmath9b by 1@xmath13 ( combined model and experimental uncertainties ) . for the agss09ph model ,",
    "the situation is exactly opposite .    in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : neu ]",
    ", we show the added @xmath14n and @xmath15o fluxes against the @xmath9b flux . models of different composition ( agss09 or gs98 ) can be more easily distinguished using cno fluxes as illustrated in this figure .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that current model uncertainties seem to prevent any possibility of a 2@xmath13 or better result . discussion on main sources of uncertainties and how the situation can be improved can be found in @xcite .",
    "be and @xmath9b .",
    "current measurements from borexino ( @xmath10be ) and the average from the three phases of sno ( @xmath16b ) are shown with corresponding error bars at @xmath17 level .",
    "b _ shows the added contributions of the @xmath14n and @xmath18o fluxes against the @xmath9b flux .",
    "the shaded area represents the sno measurement for the @xmath9b including @xmath17 uncertainties [ fig : neu ] ]",
    "since revisions of solar cno photospheric abundances were strongly revised downwards @xcite , attempts have been made to obtain independent determinations of , or at least to impose constraints on , the solar composition @xcite .",
    "there has also been a number of works devoted to analize what changes in the input physics of the models would allow to construct solar models with low metallicity that are consistent with helioseismology measurements .",
    "we mention , but do not discuss , some of the proposed changes are : changes in composition , e.g. large enhancement of neon abundances @xcite , enhanced microscopic diffusion @xcite , accretion of metal - poor material @xcite .",
    "the viability of these changes and others has been reviewed at some length by @xcite and we refer the interested reader to that reference for details .",
    "the short summary is that none of the proposed changes can , by itself , offer a solution to the conundrum originated by the low cno and ne abundances presented by asplund and collaborators .",
    "one is left with the unpleasant option of combining different effects to improve the helioseismology properties of the low - z models , and/or to fine tune the necessary changes in the models .    here , we consider in certain amount of detail the effect of new abundances in the opacities .",
    "this has certainly considered before in the light of @xcite abundances by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite has considered this issue by comparing the opacity difference between model s and a solar model with solar composition from @xcite .",
    "the authors find differences in opacities of the order of 30% at the bottom of the convective envelope that smoothly decrease towards the center , where 5% differences are found . here",
    ", we have followed a very similar line of argument but considered our gs98 model as the reference model and , in addition to the ags05 model , considered those constructed with the two flavors of the new solar abundances , our agss09 and agss09ph models .    ]",
    "the main results are shown in figure  [ fig : opac ] where we present the relative differences in opacities between the low - z models and the gs98 model .",
    "for the new agss09 model , differences are of the order of 15% , i.e. a factor of 2 smaller that those found by @xcite , close to the base of the convective zone .",
    "somewhat smaller values result in the same region for the agss09ph model due to the larger mg photospheric abundance .",
    "close to the center , the opacity in the agss09 model is about 5% lower than in gs98 ( similar result as in @xcite ) while the agss09ph has a deficit of only 2% due to its enhanced fe abundance .",
    "we do not open judgement here as whether these differences are comparable or not to uncertainties in current opacity calculations . in this regard ,",
    "we do recall the reader that in the radiative solar interior , differences between opal and opacity project opacities do not rise above 2.5% , quite below to what is needed to restore the agreement between solar models with low - z and helioseismology .     for the standard agss09 and gs98 models and a model with agss09 composition but the opacity increased as described in the text [ fig : neu_opac ] ]    in closing this discussion , we present results of a solar model , agss09+opac",
    ", with the same composition as used in the agss09 where opacities have been increased by the fractional amount shown in the black dashed line shown in figure  [ fig : opac ] .",
    "@xcite showed that models where the opacity is increased to compensate changes induced by the modified composition reproduce all helioseismic properties of the reference model . in this respect ,",
    "our results are in the same line ; the model with increased opacity performs equally well than the gs98 model in terms of helioseismic quantities . in figure",
    "[ fig : neu_opac ] we show for gs98 , agss09 , and agss09+opac models the results for solar neutrino fluxes . in the top panel",
    "it is shown that the @xmath10be and @xmath9b fluxes , affected by the solar composition mostly through its effect on opacities , of the agss09+opac model are very similar to those from the reference gs98 model .",
    "there is a degeneracy in these fluxes between the solar composition and the opacities .",
    "based on this , one should be careful when comparing neutrino fluxes from models ( with wrong helioseismic properties , as it is the case for agss09 ) with experimental determinations : fixing helioseismic properties , e.g. by changing opacities , will likely affect neutrino predictions .",
    "on the other hand , in the lower panel , the added @xmath14n and @xmath15o fluxes could in principle be used to determine the solar core metallicity ( more exactly , the total c+n abundance ) . in view of this",
    ", we point out the importance of current and future efforts to measure neutrino fluxes coming from cno reactions .",
    "we have attempted , in this incomplete review , to describe the current status of the _ solar abundance problem _ that originated with new determinations of solar photospheric abundances from asplund and collaborators .",
    "results discussed here are based on models computed with both the original @xcite and the newest @xcite solar compositions .",
    "our reference for a _ good _ solar model is based on the @xcite composition .",
    "the most important result is that with the new @xcite abundances , the qualitative picture that emerged a few years ago , i.e. that low - z solar models are in gross disagreement with helioseismology , remains the same .",
    "quantitatively , the disagreement is less severe because the new abundances have slightly higher cno abundances and a somewhat larger ne abundance .",
    "the changes , however , do not help much neither in restoring the agreement with helioseismology nor in facilitating the way for alternative solutions in the form of modified input physics for solar models .",
    "we have described with some detail the effect of the new composition in opacities and the required change to recover good helioseismic properties .",
    "changes of order 15% are needed , which are still much higher than currently estimated uncertainties in radiative opacities for the solar interior .",
    "in addition to helioseismic properties of the models , we have discussed the effects of the composition on the predicted neutrino fluxes and compared , when possible , with results from solar neutrino experiments .",
    "additionally , we have tried to encourage efforts to experimentally determine neutrino fluxes from cno bicycle , since these are the most sensitive fluxes to changes in abundances of cno elements , thus offering the best chances for neutrinos to put direct constraints on the solar core composition .",
    "i thank the people with whom i have been lucky enough to work on solar modelling over the last few years , particularly s. basu , w. chaplin , and w. haxton .",
    "my gratitude goes also to the organizers of the conference _ synergies between solar and stellar modelling _ , in particular maria pia di mauro , for the invitation to participate , the chosen location , and the exciting atmosphere they contributed to create ."
