    "recently , structure and dynamics in complex networks have attracted considerable attention and have been investigated in a large variety of research fields @xcite . in particular , an important topic is whether the structure of neural wiring is related to brain functions .    starting from pioneering milestone works that modeled ising spin for neural networks ,",
    "a large body of research has made a significant contribution to our understanding of parallel information processing in nervous tissue @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the hopfield model in a fully connected topology with the typical hebbian prescription for the interaction strengths have been successfully described by a replica method @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the fully connected hopfield model with static patterns and sequence patterns have been widely studied using generating functional analysis @xcite and signal - to - noise analysis @xcite .    in recent years ,",
    "there have been a large number of numerical studies of the hopfield model on the complex structure , focusing on how the topology of a network , the degree distribution in particular , affects the computational performance of the formation of associative memories @xcite .",
    "various random diluted models have been studied , including the extreme diluted model @xcite , the finite diluted model @xcite , and the finite connection model @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , here we derive for the first time the equation of retrieval dynamics for sequence processing neural networks with complex network topology .    in this paper",
    ", we study a modification of the hopfield network , known as the sequence processing model , which acts as a temporary associative memory model @xcite .",
    "this model is very important to understand how the nervous system allows the learning of behavioral sequences because it requires hundreds of transitions that need to be precisely stored in neuronal connections @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry of the interaction matrix rules out equilibrium statistical mechanical methods of analysis , including conventional replica theory .",
    "the goal of this work is to study the effect of the degree distribution on the transient dynamics of the sequence processing neural network . using a probability approach , we derive an analytic time evolution equation for the overlap parameter with an arbitrary degree distribution that is consistent with our extensive numerical simulation results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect2 ]",
    "we introduce the definition of the sequence processing neural networks .",
    "the time evolution equations of the order parameters for the effects of degree distribution are derived and discussed in section [ sect3 ] .",

    "the embedded patterns are @xmath6 states of the systems @xmath7 .",
    "the patterns are random so that each @xmath8 takes the values @xmath9 with equal probability .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we present the evolutionary processes of the order parameter @xmath29 for the typical sequence processing model with a global connection . it is found that the stored memories are reconstructed as a period-@xmath30 cycle : @xmath31 in fig . [ fig1](a ) , and @xmath32 in fig .",
