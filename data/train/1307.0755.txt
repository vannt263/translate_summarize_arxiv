    "ratchet effects can occur for particles interacting with asymmetric substrates if the substrate is flashed on and off periodically or if an external ac drive is applied , and result in a net dc motion of the particles that is typically aligned with the direction of the substrate asymmetry @xcite .",
    "when the particles interact with each other as well as the substrate , the ratchet effect can exhibit reversals where the particles move with the substrate asymmetry in some regimes , and against it in others @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to create ratchet effects for particles moving over two dimensional ( 2d ) symmetric substrates by driving the particles with two different ac drives that sum together to create an asymmetric pattern of particle motion @xcite .",
    "directed motion on periodic substrates has been demonstrated experimentally for colloidal particles driven over magnetic substrates @xcite .",
    "more recently , ratchet effects have been observed in the absence of an external drive for systems of self - driven particles , termed active matter .",
    "examples of active matter include swimming bacteria and crawling cells @xcite .",
    "numerous realizations of artificial active matter have been created experimentally for self driven colloidal systems @xcite .",
    "active matter ratchet effects have been obtained for swimming bacteria in an asymmetric funnel array in experiments @xcite , theory and simulations @xcite , as well as for other types of swimming organisms@xcite and eukaryotic cells @xcite .",
    "there has also been a recent proposal to rectify active particles interacting with symmetric substrates @xcite .",
    "variants on the active matter ratchet have been used to create active matter - powered gears @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of active matter particles are often described by run and tumble motion where the particles move for a persistence length or periodic time before reorienting , or the particles may move in a persistent random walk @xcite . in other active matter systems , the particles undergo circular motion such as found in swimming bacteria near surfaces @xcite and other types of swimming cells @xcite .",
    "a variety of circle swimmers have been studied theoretically and in simulations @xcite , and in recent experiments , it was demonstrated how to create artificial chiral colloidal moving particles that swim in circles with a fixed chirality depending on the asymmetric nature of the particle itself @xcite .",
    "there are also proposals for creating molecular - sized chiral microswimmers by combining chiral molecules with chiral propellers @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the novel types of dynamics that arise for circularly swimming particles interacting with patterned substrates could lead to the ability to control the motion of such systems , which could be used for separation techniques or to extract work from active matter .",
    "recently , it was shown that artificial swimmers in a periodic substrate array prefer to swim along certain symmetry directions of the array @xcite , while mijalkov and volpe recently proposed a method for sorting circle swimmers moving with opposite chirality by using a substrate of chiral flower patterns or by having the particles move in channels of asymmetric arrays @xcite .    in this work",
    "we examine circularly swimming particles interacting with an array of l - shaped barriers that create an asymmetric landscape .",
    "the particles experience only contact interactions with the barriers , as in previous studies of run and tumble swimmers in asymmetric arrays @xcite . after contacting a barrier ,",
    "the particle motion normal to the barrier is suppressed , and the particle swims along the barrier at reduced speed until reaching the end of the barrier or rotating away from it . in the absence of a substrate ,",
    "the particles show no dc drift ; however , when the array is present we observe a series of regimes in which the particles form periodic orbits that produce net dc motion .",
    "we find that the directed motion remains locked over specific ranges of the swimming radii . in 2d",
    ", the particle motion is generally locked along particular symmetry directions of the array , but the direction of the motion may switch as the swimming radius varies .",
    "we also find that for certain values of the swimming radius , there is no dc motion and the particle orbits are localized .",
    "the fact that the magnitude and the direction of the dc motion can be controlled by varying the swimming radius indicates that this type of substrate could be used to separate particles with different swimming radii",
    ". when the chirality of the swimmers is reversed , a different set of directed motion regimes appears , permitting particles with the same swimming radius but different chirality to be separated .",
    "we find that the directed motion is generally reduced when the thermal fluctuations increase ; however , there are regimes where the directed motion is enhanced by the additional fluctuations .",
    "we demonstrate these effects for oblique and square arrays of even l - shaped barriers as well as for a square array of simple one - dimensional ( 1d ) barriers .",
    "we consider a 2d system with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath0 and @xmath1-directions containing a periodic array of even l - shaped barriers , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a , b ) . in the even l shape ,",
    "both arms of the l are identical in length .",
    "we refer to these barriers as `` l - shaped '' in the remainder of the paper .",
    "the particles are initialized at random positions in the free regions between barriers ; in this work , we do not consider the effects of particle - particle interactions .",
    "the dynamics of particle @xmath2 is governed by the following overdamped equation of motion : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the damping constant , @xmath5 is the motor force , @xmath6 is the force from interactions with the barriers , @xmath7 is an external drift force , and @xmath8 is the thermal force .",
    "the motor force drives each particle in a circular manner with @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the sign of the rotation . in the absence of a substrate ,",
    "for @xmath12 and @xmath13 the particle moves in a counterclockwise orbit forming a circle with radius @xmath14 ; for @xmath15 , the motion is clockwise .",
    "the barriers cause a short range steric repulsion of the particles , and a particle in contact with a barrier will move along the barrier with the component of @xmath16 that is parallel to the barrier until it reaches the end of the barrier or the orientation of @xmath16 changes enough to move the particle away from the barrier .",
    "this is the same type of barrier interaction used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the sliding of particles along the barriers is also consistent with experimental observations of swimming bacteria .",
    "the thermal kicks come from the langevin noise term @xmath8 with the properties @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we focus on systems of size @xmath20 with @xmath21 in dimensionless units , and with barrier lattice constants of around @xmath22 .",
    "we have also run larger system sizes and find that all our results are robust .",
    "we have studied different lattice constants for fixed system size and find the same results ; however , there is a systematic shift of the rectification regime to lower ac amplitudes as the barrier lattice constant is reduced .",
    "we consider three substrate types : an oblique array of l - shaped barriers [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , a square array of l - shaped barriers [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , and a square array of simple 1d barriers [ fig .",
    "for the l - shaped barriers , the lack of rotational symmetry in the system produces different motion for particles with different chiralities , which is important for separation .",
    "the system with simple 1d barriers has a rotational symmetry and is used to clarify the effect of breaking rotational symmetry by comparison with the l - shaped barrier systems .",

    "the exchange of the velocity response from @xmath62 to @xmath63 with the change in chirality makes the square barrier lattice more convenient than the oblique lattice for particle separation techniques since a measurement of the motion of one chirality of swimmer immediately determines how a swimmer of the opposite chirality will move . for example , if one chirality of swimmer moves strictly in the @xmath1 direction at a specific value of @xmath28 , then the opposite chirality of swimmers must move strictly in the @xmath0 direction for the same value of @xmath28 .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath67 in fig .",
    "13(a ) , which shows the counterclockwise swimmers translating in the @xmath1 direction , and fig .",
    "13(b ) , which shows the clockwise swimmers undergoing the same motion rotated by 90 degrees , with a resulting translation in the @xmath0 direction .",
    "similarly , at @xmath112 , fig .",
    "13(e ) shows that the counterclockwise swimmers translate in the @xmath1 direction while , in fig .",
    "13(f ) , the clockwise swimmers translate in the @xmath0 direction with an orbit of the same shape but rotated by 90 degrees . at @xmath110 ,",
    "12(a , b ) shows that counterclockwise swimmers have positive velocities in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions with @xmath114 . in the corresponding particle trajectory in fig .",
    "13(c ) , the particle moves further in @xmath1 than in @xmath0 after several cycles .",
    "for the clockwise swimmers at @xmath115 , the motion is similar with positive velocities in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions , but now @xmath116 , and the corresponding trajectory in fig .",
    "13(d ) is a rotated version of the trajectory in fig .",
    "13(c ) .    for both the square and oblique lattices of l - shaped barriers , we also find that for intervals of @xmath28 where there is no rectification , the application of a dc drift force in one of the directions can induce locking of the motion in the driven direction as well as a transverse rectification .",
    "there are also smaller regimes of the external drive where the transverse rectification occurs at different values of the external drive for particles of different chirality , indicating that this could provide another method for particle separation .",
    "( lower dark curve ) and @xmath40 ( upper light curve ) vs @xmath28 for counterclockwise swimmers .",
    "( b ) @xmath29 ( upper dark curve ) and @xmath40 ( lower light curve ) vs @xmath28 for clockwise swimmers . for both types of swimmers ,",
    "@xmath117 over the entire range of @xmath28 . , width=336 ]    .",
    "( a ) counterclockwise swimmers translate in the negative @xmath0 direction .",
    "( b ) clockwise swimmers translate in the positive @xmath0 direction .",
    ", width=336 ]    we have also considered particles moving in a square array of 1d barriers as illustrated in fig .",
    "this system has an even higher degree of symmetry than the square lattice of l - shaped barriers , since the barrier lattice now has a rotational symmetry . in fig .",
    "14(a ) and ( b ) we plot @xmath29 and @xmath40 vs @xmath28 for the array of 1d barriers for counterclockwise and clockwise swimmers , respectively .",
    "in both cases we observe rectification in the @xmath0-direction while @xmath118 the rectification regimes appear at regularly spaced intervals in @xmath28 , and the rectification is in the negative @xmath0 direction for the counterclockwise swimmers and in the positive @xmath0 direction for the clockwise swimmers . figures 15(a ) and",
    "( b ) illustrate this rectification for the counterclockwise and clockwise swimmers , respectively , at @xmath119 where the particles interact with two barriers per cycle .",
    "both chiralities of swimmers execute orbits with the same shapes , but reversing the chirality flips the orbit by 180 degrees . although the regime where rectification occurs for the 1d barriers is smaller than that for the l - shaped barriers , the fact that particles of different chirality move in opposite directions through the 1d barriers could make the 1d barrier array the most practical choice for a separation technique .",
    "we have examined circularly swimming particles interacting with periodic arrays of l - shaped or rod - shaped barriers .",
    "the particles experience only contact interactions with the barriers , and when in contact with the barrier , a particle moves according to its driving force component that is parallel to the barrier wall . in the absence of barriers",
    ", there is no net dc motion . for oblique and square arrays of l - shaped barriers ,",
    "we observe a rich variety of distinct rectifying phases where dc motion can arise in numerous different directions .",
    "these dynamic phases appear as the swimming radius of the particles is varied , and the rectifying phases are associated with periodic orbits in which the particles interact with one or move barriers during each swimming cycle . at certain radii values ,",
    "the particles become localized and exhibit no net dc rectification .",
    "since the rectification direction varies with swimming radius , such barrier arrays could be used to separate particles with different swimming radii but the same chirality of swimming direction .",
    "when the chirality is reversed , the particles rectify in a different set of directions as the swimming radius varies , implying that particles with different chirality can also be separated with the barrier arrays .",
    "our results are robust at finite temperature , and we find that the thermal fluctuations can in some cases enhance the rectification by increasing the frequency with which the particles interact with the barriers . for square arrays of l - shaped barriers , the velocity response of counterclockwise swimming particles is rotated with respect to that of clockwise swimming particles , with the @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) response of the counterclockwise swimmers becoming the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) response of the clockwise swimmers .",
    "this indicates that in a regime where the counterclockwise swimmers translate strictly in the positive @xmath0 direction , the clockwise swimmers move strictly in the positive @xmath1 direction .",
    "the symmetry of the velocity response could be used to more readily separate particles of different chiralities . for a square array of 1d barriers",
    ", we find that rectification effects still occur over reduced ranges of the swimming radius .",
    "for the 1d barrier arrays , the rectification occurs only in one direction for a given chirality , and particles of the opposite chirality move in the opposite direction .",
    "our results could be realized experimentally using the recently studied artificial circle swimmers , swimming bacteria , or other active matter particles that move in circles . beyond self - driven particles",
    ", it should also be possible to create systems of particles that move in circles due to some type of rotating external field .",
