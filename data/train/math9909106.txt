    "let @xmath2 be a complete , finite volume hyperbolic @xmath1-manifold with @xmath3 torus cusps , which we denote @xmath4 .",
    "the following definition is found in @xcite :    a collection of cusps @xmath5 is _ geometrically isolated _ from a collection @xmath6 if any hyperbolic dehn surgery on any collection of the @xmath7 leaves the geometric structure on all the @xmath8 invariant .",
    "note that this definition is _ not _ symmetric in the collections @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and in fact there are examples which show that a symmetrized definition is strictly stronger ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , we can ask for some prescribed set of fillings on the @xmath7 which leave the @xmath8 invariant .",
    "generalized ( non - integral ) hyperbolic surgeries on a cusp are a holomorphic parameter for the space of all ( not necessarily complete ) hyperbolic structures on @xmath2 with a particular kind of allowable singularities ( i.e. generalized cone structures ) in a neighborhood of the complete structure .",
    "moreover , the complex dimension of the space of geometric shapes on a complete cusp is @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , for dimension reasons whenever @xmath10 there will be families of generalized surgeries leaving the geometric structures on the @xmath8 invariant . there is no particular reason to expect , however , that any of these points will correspond to an _ integral _ surgery on the @xmath7 .",
    "when there is a @xmath9 complex dimensional holomorphic family of isolated generalized surgeries which contains infinitely many integral surgeries , we say that we have an example of an _ isolation phenomenon_.    neumann and reid describe other qualities of isolation in @xcite including the following :    a collection of cusps @xmath11 is _ strongly isolated _ from a collection @xmath12 if after any hyperbolic dehn surgeries on any collection of the @xmath8 , a further surgery on any collection of the @xmath7 leaves the geometry of the ( possibly filled ) cusps @xmath8 invariant .    a collection of cusps @xmath11 is _ first - order isolated _ from a collection @xmath12 if the derivative of the deformation map from generalized surgeries on the @xmath7 to the space of cusp shapes on the @xmath8 vanishes at the complete structure .    by using the structure of the @xmath13 function defined in @xcite ,",
    "neumann and reid show that strong isolation and first order isolation _ are _ symmetric relations .",
    "first order isolation can be restated in terms of group cohomology , and is studied in some papers of kapovich , notably @xcite .",
    "in this paper we produce new constructions of isolation phenomena of various qualities , both by extending or modifying known constructions , and by introducing a conceptually original construction based on napoleon s theorem in plane geometry .",
    "the sheer wealth of examples that these techniques can produce , used in combination , strongly suggests that instances of isolation phenomena are not isolated phenomena .",
    "suppose we want to show that a cusp @xmath14 is isolated from a cusp @xmath15 .",
    "then since the shape of the complete cusp @xmath14 depends holomorphically on the generalized surgery on @xmath15 , it suffices to show that infinitely many surgeries on @xmath15 keep the structure of @xmath14 fixed , since these can only accumulate at the complete ( unfilled ) structure , where we know the function relating the structure on @xmath14 to the surgery on @xmath15 is regular .",
    "we describe this holomorphic structure in more detail .",
    "choose a meridian @xmath16 of a cusp @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath17 be obtained by doing @xmath18 surgery on @xmath15 .",
    "the hyperbolic structure on @xmath17 determines a representation @xmath19 .",
    "the image of @xmath20 $ ] under this representation has a well  defined _ complex length _",
    "@xmath21 in @xmath22 , which is the logarithm of the ratio of the eigenvalues of @xmath23 .",
    "we may choose a branch of the logarithm so that the value @xmath24 corresponds to the complete structure .",
    "then small deformations of the hyperbolic structure on @xmath2 corresponding to generalized surgeries on @xmath15 are parameterized in a @xmath25 way by @xmath21 .",
    "the set of euclidean structures on a complete cusp @xmath14 are parameterized by the complex orbifold @xmath26 , and it is well  known that the map from @xmath27 is analytic , and regular at @xmath24 . for more detail , see @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of isolation was initiated in @xcite .",
    "most of the examples constructed in @xcite of pairs of cusps @xmath28 which are geometrically isolated have the property that there is a totally geodesic rigid triangle orbifold separating the two cusps .",
    "such a separating surface splits the manifold @xmath2 into two pieces @xmath29 where @xmath30 sits as a cusp in @xmath31 .",
    "then a surgery on @xmath30 deforms only the piece @xmath31 , keeping the geometry of the splitting orbifold unchanged , and @xmath31 can then be glued to @xmath32 to produce a complete hyperbolic structure on @xmath2 .",
    "one sees that the geometry of the entire piece containing the unfilled cusp is unchanged by this operation , and therefore that each of the two cusps is isolated from the other cusp .",
    "if @xmath2 covers an orbifold @xmath33 containing a totally geodesic triangle orbifold which separates cusps @xmath15 and @xmath14 , then in @xmath2 any surgeries on lifts of @xmath15 which descend to @xmath33 will leave unaffected the structures on lifts of @xmath14 .",
    "a refinement of the construction above comes when the rigid orbifold is boundary parallel .",
    "the square torus @xmath34 and the hexagonal torus @xmath35 have rotational symmetries of order @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "if these symmetries about a cusp @xmath15 can be made to extend over the entire manifold @xmath2 , then any surgery preserving these symmetries will keep the cusp @xmath15 square or hexagonal respectively . note that isolation phenomena produced by this method tend to be one  way .",
    "let @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a knot which has @xmath36fold rotational symmetry , as seen from either of the @xmath40 ends of @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath2 has @xmath36fold rotational symmetry which is preserved after @xmath18 filling on the knot @xmath39 .",
    "this symmetry keeps the shape of the two ends of @xmath41 square after every surgery on @xmath39 . in general , surgery on either of the ends of the @xmath40 will disrupt the symmetry and not exhibit any isolation .      an incompressible surface in a hyperbolic manifold",
    "does not need to be rigid for certain topological symmetries to be realized as geometric symmetries . in a finite volume hyperbolic @xmath1manifold , an incompressible , @xmath42incompressible surface @xmath43 without accidental parabolics which is not the fiber of a fibration over @xmath44 is quasifuchsian , and therefore corresponds to a unique point in @xmath45 . for surfaces @xmath43 of low genus ,",
    "the tautological curve over the teichm \" uller space of @xmath43 has certain symmetries which restrict to a symmetry of each fiber  that is , of each riemann surface topologically equivalent to @xmath43 .",
    "there is a corresponding symmetry of the universal curve over @xmath46 and therefore of a quasifuchsian representation of @xmath43 .",
    "geometrically , this means that one can cut along a minimal surface representing the class of @xmath43 and reglue it by an automorphism which preserves the geometric structure to give a complete nonsingular hyperbolic structure on a new manifold . actually , one does not need to know there is an equivariant minimal surface along which one can cut  one can perform the cutting and gluing at the level of limit sets by using maskit s combinations theorems ( @xcite ) .",
    "this operation is called _ mutation _ and is studied extensively by ruberman , for instance in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath43 is a sphere with @xmath36 punctures , we can think of @xmath43 as a riemann sphere with @xmath36 points deleted . after a m \" obius transformation",
    ", we can assume @xmath1 of these points are at @xmath47 and the @xmath36th is at the complex number @xmath48 .",
    "the full symmetry group @xmath49 does not act holomorphically on @xmath43 except in very special cases , but the subgroup consisting of @xmath50 and its conjugates _ does _ act holomorphically .",
    "this group is known as the _ klein @xmath36group_.    geometrically , where we find an appropriate @xmath36punctured sphere in a hyperbolic manifold @xmath2 , we can cut along the sphere and reglue after permuting the punctures .",
    "this operation leaves invariant the geometric structure on those pieces of the manifold that do not meet the sphere .",
    "if @xmath43 is a spherical orbifold or cone manifold with @xmath36 equivalent cone points , we can similarly cut and reglue .",
    "the sphere along which the mutation is performed is called a _",
    "conway sphere_. the observation that mutation can be performed for spherical orbifolds is standard : one can always find a finite manifold cover of any hyperbolic orbifold , by selberg s lemma .",
    "the spherical orbifold lifts to an incompressible surface in this cover , and one can cut and reglue equivariantly in the cover .",
    "in fact , local rigidity for small cone angles developed by hodgson and kerckhoff in @xcite suggests that this can be done just as easily for the cone manifold case , but this is superfluous for our applications .",
    "let @xmath2 be a manifold with a single cusp @xmath15 which admits a @xmath51 symmetry that acts on @xmath15 as a rotation . this symmetry forces @xmath15 to be hexagonal .",
    "let @xmath52 be a point in @xmath2 not fixed by @xmath51 , and let @xmath53 be obtained by equivariantly removing @xmath1 balls centered at the orbit of @xmath52 .",
    "glue another manifold with @xmath51 symmetry to @xmath53 along its spherical boundaries @xmath54 so that the symmetries on either side are compatible , to make @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath39 be a @xmath51-invariant knot in @xmath55 which intersects each of the spheres @xmath56 in @xmath36 points and which is sufficiently complicated that its complement in @xmath55 is atoroidal and the @xmath36punctured spheres @xmath56 are incompressible and @xmath42incompressible .",
    "perform a mutation on @xmath57 which destroys the @xmath51symmetry to get a manifold @xmath33 with two cusps which we refer to as @xmath15 and @xmath14 , where @xmath14 corresponds to the core of @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath15 is hexagonal , since mutation does not affect the geometric structure away from the splitting surface .",
    "moreover , for large integers @xmath58 , any generalized @xmath59 surgery on @xmath14 will preserve the fact that the @xmath56 are incompressible , @xmath42incompressible spheres with @xmath36 cone points of order @xmath58 , and therefore we can undo the mutation on @xmath57 to see that these surgeries do not affect the hexagonal structure on @xmath15 .",
    "but if a real @xmath9parameter family of surgeries on @xmath14 do not affect the structure on @xmath15 , then _ every _ surgery on @xmath14 keeps the structure on @xmath15 fixed , so @xmath15 is isolated from @xmath14 .",
    "note that for general @xmath18 surgeries on @xmath14 , the spheres @xmath56 will be destroyed and the surgered manifold will not be mutation  equivalent to a @xmath51 symmetric manifold .",
    "moreover , for sufficiently generic @xmath39 , there will be no rigid triangle orbifolds in @xmath33 separating @xmath15 from @xmath14 . as far as we know ,",
    "this is the first example of geometric isolation to be constructed that is not forced by a rigid separating or boundary parallel surface .",
    "we note in passing that mutation followed by surgery often preserves other analytic invariants of hyperbolic cusped manifolds , such as volume and ( up to a constant ) , chern ",
    "simons invariants .",
    "ruberman observed in @xcite that if @xmath39 and a conway sphere @xmath43 are _ unlinked _",
    ", then a mutation which preserves this unlinking can actually be achieved by mutation along the genus @xmath60 surface obtained by tubing together the sphere @xmath43 with a tubular neighborhood of @xmath39 .",
    "this mutation corresponds to the hyperelliptic involution of a genus @xmath60 surface .",
    "since this surface is present and incompressible for all but finitely many surgeries on @xmath39 and its mutant , the surgered mutants are mutants themselves . if @xmath43 and @xmath39 are not unlinked , no such hyperelliptic surface can be found , and in fact in this case there is no clear relationship between invariants of the manifold obtained after surgeries on the original knot and on the mutant .",
    "perhaps this makes the persistence of isolation under mutation more interesting , since it shows that some of the effects of mutation are persistent under surgeries where other effects are destroyed .",
    "a finite volume complete but not compact hyperbolic @xmath1manifold @xmath2 can be decomposed into a finite union of ( possibly degenerate ) ideal tetrahedra glued together along their faces .",
    "an ideal tetrahedron determines and is determined by its fourtuple of endpoints on the sphere at infinity of @xmath61 . identifying this sphere with @xmath62",
    ", we can think of the ideal tetrahedron as a @xmath36tuple of complex numbers .",
    "the isometry type of the tetrahedron is determined by the _ cross  ratio _ of these @xmath36 points ; equivalently , if we move three of the points to @xmath47 by a hyperbolic isometry , the isometry type of the tetrahedron is determined by the location of the @xmath36th point , that is by a value in @xmath63 .",
    "this value is referred to as the _ simplex parameter _ of the ideal tetrahedron .",
    "a combinatorial complex @xmath64 of simplices glued together can be realized geometrically as an ideal triangulation of a finite volume hyperbolic manifold ( after removing the vertices of @xmath64 ) if certain equations in the simplex parameters are satisfied .",
    "these equations can be given explicitly by examining the links of vertices of the triangulation .",
    "for a finite volume non  compact hyperbolic manifold , all the links of vertices of @xmath64 should be tori @xmath65 .",
    "there are induced triangulations @xmath66 of these tori by the small triangles obtained by cutting off the tips of the tetrahedra in @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath67 and let @xmath68 be a hypothetical assignment of simplex parameters to the tetrahedra @xmath69 .",
    "then the horoball sections of a hypothetical hyperbolic structure on @xmath70 are euclidean tori triangulated by euclidean triangles , which are the horoball sections of the @xmath69 .",
    "if the simplex parameter of an ideal tetrahedron is @xmath48 , the euclidean triangles obtained as sections of the horoballs centered at its vertices have the similarity type of the triangle in @xmath71 with vertices at @xmath72 .",
    "a path in the dual @xmath9skeleton to @xmath66 determines a developing map of @xmath66 in @xmath71 : given a choice of the initial triangle , there is a unique choice of each subsequent triangle within its fixed euclidean similarity type such that the combinatorial edge it shares with its predecessor is made to geometrically agree with it .",
    "the _ holonomy _ of a closed path in this dual skeleton is the euclidean similarity taking the initial triangle to the final triangle .",
    "there are two necessary conditions to be met in order for the hyperbolic structures on the @xmath69 to glue up to give a hyperbolic structure on @xmath73 .",
    "these conditions are actually sufficient in a small neighborhood of the complete structure as described in @xcite and made rigorous in @xcite .",
    "a @xmath18 hyperbolic dehn surgery translates in this context to replacing the cusp equations for some cusp by the condition that the holonomy around the meridian and longitude give euclidean similarities @xmath76 such that @xmath77 .",
    "the analytic co ",
    "ordinates on dehn surgery space determined by the analytic parameters @xmath68 are holomorphically related to the @xmath21 co  ordinates alluded to earlier .",
    "the geometry of a complete cusp is determined by the translations corresponding to the holonomy of the meridian and longitude .",
    "let the vertices of @xmath78 be @xmath81 .",
    "the three centers of the @xmath80 are of the form @xmath82 for certain complex numbers @xmath83 so the shape of the resulting triangle is a holomorphic function of @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath48 is real and between @xmath24 and @xmath9 then the center of @xmath85 splits the line between @xmath24 and @xmath86 in the ratio @xmath87 , the center of @xmath88 splits the line between @xmath86 and @xmath9 in the ratio @xmath87 , and the center of @xmath89 is at @xmath90 . but",
    "a clockwise rotation through @xmath91 about @xmath90 takes the line between @xmath24 and @xmath86 to the line between @xmath86 and @xmath9 ; i.e. it takes the center of @xmath85 to the center of @xmath88 .",
    "thus the theorem is true for real @xmath48 and by holomorphicity , it is true for all @xmath48 .",
    "napoleon s theorem gives rise to an interesting phenomenon in plane geometry : fix a triangle @xmath78 .",
    "then three triangles isometric to @xmath78 and three equilateral triangles with side length equal to the sides of @xmath78 can be glued together to make a hexagon which tiles the plane with symmetry group @xmath92 as in figure 1 .",
    "the edge lengths of the three equilateral triangles are equal to the three edge lengths of @xmath78 , and around each vertex the angles are the three interior angles of @xmath78 together with three angles equal to @xmath93 .",
    "it follows that the hexagon in question exists and tiles the plane ; to see that it has the purported symmetry group , observe that the combinatorics of the triangulation have a @xmath1fold symmetry about the centers of the three equilateral triangles bounding some fixed triangle of type @xmath78 .",
    "these three centers are the vertices of an equilateral triangle , by napoleon s theorem ; it follows that the symmetry group of the tiling contains the group generated by three rotations of order @xmath1 with centers at the vertices of an equilateral triangle  that is to say , the symmetry group @xmath92 .",
    "if we imagine that these triangles are the asymptotic horoball sections of ideal tetrahedra going out a cusp of a hyperbolic manifold , we see that appropriate deformations of the tetrahedral parameters change the triangulation _ but not the geometry _ of the cusp . for @xmath78 a horoball section of an ideal tetrahedron with simplex parameter @xmath48 ,",
    "the holonomy around vertices is just @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the similarity type of an equilateral triangle , and the holonomy around the meridian and longitude are both translations by complex numbers @xmath96 whose ratio is @xmath97 .",
    "a scheme to parlay this theorem into isolation phenomena is given by the following setup : we have two hexagons @xmath98 each tiled by six equilateral triangles .",
    "we divide these twelve triangles into two similarity types , corresponding to the triangles in @xmath71 with vertices at @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and we choose a preferred vertex for each triangle corresponding to @xmath24 , in the manner indicated in figure 2 . for an arbitrary choice of complex numbers @xmath48 and @xmath101 , the hexagons can be realized geometrically to give affine structures on the tori obtained by gluing opposite sides of @xmath102 together and similarly for @xmath103 . initially set @xmath104 .",
    "deforming @xmath48 but keeping @xmath101 fixed changes the affine structure on the first torus but leaves the structure on the second torus unchanged .",
    "for , the combinatorial triangulation of the second torus is exactly the triangulation of a fundamental domain of the tessellation in figure 1 .",
    "it follows that for @xmath105 and @xmath48 arbitrary , the universal cover of the second torus is tiled by a tessellation with symmetry group @xmath92 and the torus is therefore hexagonal .",
    "similarly , deforming @xmath101 and keeping @xmath106 changes the affine structure on the second torus but leaves the structure on the first torus unchanged , since now we can identify the combinatorial triangulation of the _ first _ torus with the triangulation of a fundamental domain of the tessellation in figure 1 .",
    "this configuration of ideal tetrahedra with horoball sections equal to the two cusps in this figure can be realized geometrically by arranging six regular ideal tetrahedra in the upper  half space in a hexagonal pattern with the common edge of the tetrahedra going from @xmath24 to @xmath107 .",
    "the pattern seen from infinity looking down is @xmath102 , and the pattern seen from @xmath24 looking up is @xmath103 .",
    "the pictures are aligned so that the real line has its usual orientation .",
    "glue the twelve free faces of the tetrahedra in such a way as to make @xmath102 and @xmath103 torus cusps .",
    "this gives an orbifold @xmath33 whose underlying manifold is @xmath41 , with orbifold locus three arcs of cone angle @xmath108 each running between two @xmath109 triangle cusps arranged in the obvious symmetrical manner .",
    "unfortunately , under surgeries of the cusps of @xmath33 , the simplices do not deform in the manner required by napoleon s theorem .",
    "however , if we pass to a @xmath1-fold cover , this problem can be corrected .",
    "let @xmath110 be the link depicted in figure @xmath1 , and let @xmath111 .",
    "then @xmath2 admits a complete hyperbolic structure which can be decomposed into @xmath112 regular ideal tetrahedra .",
