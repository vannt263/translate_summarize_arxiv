    "<S> using recent precision measurements of cosmological paramters , we re - examine whether these observations alone , independent of type ia supernova surveys , are sufficient to imply the existence of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that best measurements of the age of the universe @xmath0 , the hubble parameter @xmath1 and the matter fraction @xmath2 strongly favor an equation of state defined by ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with the existence of a repulsive , acceleration - causing component of energy if the universe is nearly flat .    </S>",
    "<S> the current era in cosmology seems to be the first in which local astrophysical measurements are consistent with the generally accepted large scale cosmology . to provide some historical context , </S>",
    "<S> consider the period from 1980 to roughly 1995 . </S>",
    "<S> inflation offered us a large scale model for cosmology , requiring @xmath4 , which could not find verification in measurements on smaller scales . </S>",
    "<S> attempts to dynamically determine @xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) consistently returned results of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this led to the notion @xcite that , under the @xmath7 prior , there must be a bias between the distribution of light ( e.g. galaxies ) and mass ( e.g. the dark matter component ) . </S>",
    "<S> not only did the univese have to be dark matter dominated , the distribution of that dark matter had to be signficantly different than the the distribution of light . at the time , this was the only way to reconcile the small scale measurements with the large scale ( inflation ) requirement .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> we reinvestigate whether recent determinations of cosmological parameters are sufficient , by themselves , to imply the existence of dark energy  </S>",
    "<S> specifically , a component of energy with equation of state @xmath8 . in the mid-90 </S>",
    "<S> s several authors @xcite analyzed aggregate data based on globular cluster ages , clustering of galaxies , big bang nucleosynthesis , and the hubble constant and concluded that something like a cosmological constant might be necessary to produce a flat universe . however , the conclusions were not definitive at the time due to the large uncertainty in the observational parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our purpose is to update these earlier investigations , accounting for improvements in precision . </S>",
    "<S> we will argue that observations of key parameters such as the age of the universe @xmath0 , the hubble parameter @xmath1 and the matter fraction @xmath2 have become definitive in support of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> one might question the need for this analysis in the post - wmap era , but it is important to understand whether increasingly precise measurements are consistent with the concordance cosmology obtained from best fits of wmap data . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , given the dramatic nature and consequences of dark energy , it is important to understand the observational evidence for it as broadly and robustly as possible .    despite the impressive results of the type ia supernova collaborations @xcite , it is still possible that dust @xcite , evolution effects @xcite or exotic particle physics @xcite might alter the interpretation of the extracted redshift - distance relation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the axion models in @xcite account for the dimness of distant supernovae by conversion of photons into axions in background galactic magnetic fields , rather than through accelerated expansion . </S>",
    "<S> exotic particle physics models which are less well motivated than axions , but perhaps no more counterintuitive than the existence of dark energy itself , might in principle explain the supernova data without requiring acceleration </S>",
    "<S> . however , the demonstration that a dominant component of energy with @xmath8 is strongly favored by the observed values of cosmological parameters provides a direct and robust argument for acceleration .    </S>",
    "<S> we seek evidence for a component which has equation of state @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> recall the einstein equation @xmath9 the sign of the acceleration @xmath10 is determined by the sign of @xmath11 , where the sum runs over all contributions to the energy momentum tensor . strictly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath3 is the threshold for a component to cause acceleration when it is the only form of energy . </S>",
    "<S> if other forms of energy are non - negligible the overall sign of the right hand side of ( [ ee ] ) might still be negative ( i.e. , the universe is decelerating , albeit more slowly than otherwise ) even in the presence of energy with @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotically , though , the component with the smallest positive or most negative value of @xmath13 will eventually dominate all others . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that a cosmological constant has @xmath14 , while a dynamical scalar model with non - zero vacuum energy typically has @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> values of @xmath13 less than @xmath16 violate the null energy condition , and are generally associated with instabilities @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the 3 year wmap data @xcite favors a negative pressure equation of state for models with constant @xmath13 when constraints on the matter energy density are included ( i.e. , from the sloan digital sky survey or the 2df galaxy redshift survey ) . in this note </S>",
    "<S> we conduct a simpler analysis in which the priors are transparent and easy to state .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that best measurements of the age of the universe @xmath0 , the hubble parameter @xmath1 and the matter fraction @xmath2 are sufficient to require the existence , during some cosmologically significant epoch , of a repulsive , acceleration - causing ( @xmath3 ) component of energy , assuming the universe is nearly flat . </S>",
    "<S> a relation between these quantities is obtained using einstein s equation for a friedmann - robertson - walker universe . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis itself is not necessarily new , but it can now be applied for the very first time with stringent constraints due to recent precision measurements of the relevant cosmological parameters .    the age of the universe is given by @xmath17 which yields @xmath18 where we have taken @xmath13 constant in time and neglected the radiation component as it is numerically small . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume flatness , which implies @xmath19 , and allows us to define the integral as @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 then determine @xmath13 .    in the more general case , where the dark energy component has time varying equation of state @xmath21 , the second term in the denominator of the integral in ( [ int ] ) ( the dark energy term ) is more complicated , having the form @xmath22~.\\ ] ] if @xmath23 for all @xmath24 , the dark energy term ( [ de ] ) is always decreasing with increasing @xmath25 , and the denominator in ( [ int ] ) is larger for all @xmath25 than it would be in the special case @xmath26 , where ( [ de ] ) is constant . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if the dark energy _ never _ exhibits a repulsive equation of state , so @xmath27 at all times , the integral is bounded above : @xmath28 similarly , we deduce @xmath29 in other words , in the most general case , unless the dark energy behaved repulsively during some earlier epoch , the integral @xmath30 , and hence the product @xmath31 , is bounded above by @xmath32 . using measured values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it is therefore possible to deduce that a repulsive epoch must have occurred . </S>",
    "<S> ( note an epoch with repulsive energy does not necessarily imply overall acceleration , as discussed . )    </S>",
    "<S> we now review the best measurements of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . systematically combining the results of distinct measurements using different techniques , each with different statistical and systematic errors , is challenging . </S>",
    "<S> however , our discussion at least allows a reasonable guess at current global best values and uncertainties for these quantities . </S>",
    "<S> examples of more sophisticated bayesian analysis are given in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * @xmath0 : * our approach is made possible by relatively recent measurements of @xmath0 with unprecedented accuracy . in the past , estimates of @xmath0 have been made by either using model - dependent estimates for the ages of globular clusters or through nuclear cosmochronometry . </S>",
    "<S> the former method has traditionally suffered from the unknown role of convection and its effects on the lifetimes of low mass / low metallicity stars . </S>",
    "<S> krauss and chaboyer @xcite performed a thorough monte carlo analysis that includes these uncertainties , to arrive at a firm lower limit of 11.2 gyrs for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath0 as large as 15 gyrs is still allowable . </S>",
    "<S> using thorium cosmochronometry , sneden and cowan @xcite also find a lower limit of 11 gyrs for @xmath0 but acknowledge that lower limit could range upwards by another 3 - 4 gyrs . </S>",
    "<S> for the reasons cited , we do not use these methods or observations in construction our argument for the most probable value of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> improvements in the precision of measuring @xmath0 have utilized the white dwarf cooling curve and hubble space telescope measurements of the halo globular cluster m4 . </S>",
    "<S> measurements by hansen et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) @xcite report a value of @xmath33 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> hansen et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2004 ) @xcite update this age to @xmath34 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the major source of systematic error in this analysis involves estimating the lag time between the age of the universe and the formation of globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations of the milky way and its globular cluster system by kravtsov and gnedin ( 2005 ) @xcite indicate that the peak formation of globular clusters occurs at @xmath35 3 - 5 . </S>",
    "<S> using a mean formation redshift of @xmath36 implies that globular clusters formed at 1.2 gyr after the onset of the big bang . </S>",
    "<S> this then leads to a lower limit of @xmath0 = 12.4 gyr and a mean value of @xmath37 gyr .    </S>",
    "<S> * @xmath1 : * for decades , measurements of @xmath1 were plagued by noise and biased samples . </S>",
    "<S> today , however , there is good reason to believe that we have a relatively precise measure for this parameter as well . </S>",
    "<S> the hubble space telescope key project for determining the cepheid zero point and subsequent distance determinations to nearby galaxies using the cepheid period - luminosity relationship have returned a value of @xmath38 km / s / mpc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the major source of systematic uncertainty in that measurement lies in the distance to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , to which the zeropoint of the cepheid luminosity scale is anchored . </S>",
    "<S> freedman and madore @xcite quote a total systematic error of @xmath39 km / s / mpc , but recent improved distance estimates for the lmc ( e.g. , benedict et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) @xcite and sebo et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) have served to lower this systematic error down to @xmath40 km / s / mpc ( see ngeow and kangur ( 2006 ) @xcite ) . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> confidence in the precision of @xmath1 , as anchored by the lmc distance , is reinforced by recent measurements that are completely independent of the distance to the lmc . in the past , these kinds of measurements were also available but they had sufficiently large random error that precluded them from providing meaninful constraints on the value of @xmath1 as determined from traditional distance scale ladder techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the new observations are :    \\1 ) using a sample of 38 x - ray clusters in combination with the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , bonamente et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2006 ) @xcite derive a value of @xmath41 km / s / mpc . while there may be systematics associated with the non - spherical shape of clusters , their sample may </S>",
    "<S> is sufficiently large ( and much larger than past samples ) that this problem is removed by averaging .    </S>",
    "<S> \\2 ) wang et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2006 ) @xcite have examined a sample of 109 sn of type ia and have discovered important new corrections for metallicity and absorption ( by dust ) in determining sn ia peak luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> this recalibration leads to @xmath42 km / s / mpc . </S>",
    "<S> an independent treatment of sn ia has been compiled by riess et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2005 ) @xcite which yields a value of @xmath43 km / s / mpc with possible systematic error of @xmath44 km / s / mpc .    </S>",
    "<S> \\3 ) koopmans et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2003 ) @xcite perform a detailed analysis of a gravitational lens system ( from which a direct determination of the distance can be determined using a model mass distribution of the lens ) to find @xmath45 km / s / mpc .    averaging these 5 different results together </S>",
    "<S> formally leads to @xmath46 km / s / mpc ( error in the mean ) . </S>",
    "<S> direct averaging is crude , but gives a characterization of the uncertainty . averaging over systematic errors as well , we assume @xmath47 km / s / mpc in further analysis . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , one could use only method 1 and 3 above ( as they completely circumvent the lmc distance problem ) to obtain 76 @xmath48 6 as the relevant range .    </S>",
    "<S> * @xmath2 : * in contrast , @xmath2 remains the most weakly constrained cosmological observable . </S>",
    "<S> there are two reliable methods of measurement : dynamical determinations based on infall to clusters of galaxies and/or the nature of large scale structure ( e.g. , bothun et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) or by fitting the hubble diagram to distant objects . in the first case , </S>",
    "<S> an unbiased and fairly large sample is needed for precision ; in the second case , accurate distance measurements of intermediate redshift galaxies are required , and such measurements are ultimately based on the supernova luminosity scale . in principle , @xmath2 is highly constrained by the multi - parameter maximum likelihood fit to the wmap data ; but this is an indirect determination of @xmath2 ( as well as @xmath0 ) in the spirit of this analysis , we seek to use values of @xmath2 that have been directly determined .    </S>",
    "<S> note , though , that @xmath2 is now usually determined by assuming a flat universe as a prior constraint . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a recent accurate determination of @xmath2 results from analysis of the power spectrum of galaxy clustering . assuming a flat universe , sanchez et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2006 ) @xcite find @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , mohayee and tully ( 2005 ) @xcite revisit the peculiar velocities of galaxies in the local supercluster to derive @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> schindler ( 2002 ) @xcite summarizes all techniques to determine @xmath2 ( including the more unreliable approaches such as the x - ray cluster luminosity function , weak gravitational lensing , or galaxy cluster evolution ) . that summary yields a modal value of @xmath51 ( which is likely a realistic upper limit given the wmap model ) but also shows that most large scale structure studies yield values of @xmath2 in the range 0.20 - 0.25 ( which is consistent with the work done in the 1980s ) . </S>",
    "<S> averaging together the sanchez et al . </S>",
    "<S> and mohayee and tully studies produces a well constrained value of @xmath2 = 0.23 @xmath48 0.02 . for discussion below we take a conservatively large range for @xmath2 , assuming @xmath52 to be a one standard deviation range about the central value .    * results : * in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1a ] , we plot @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 corresponds to the curve with the largest values of @xmath31 . taking @xmath57 gyr and @xmath58 km / s / mpc , which are each one standard deviation below the favored ( central ) values in our assumed error model , we obtain @xmath59 , which corresponds to the grey horizontal line in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> the implications can be read directly from the figure . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath13 was always greater than @xmath60 , then some or all of our parameters must be well below their central values .    from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1a ] , we see that taking @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 to each be one standard deviation below their central value ( so , @xmath57 gyr , @xmath58 km / s / mpc and @xmath56 ) , an epoch with @xmath61 or so is required , which is just negative enough to imply acceleration ( @xmath62 ) . taking @xmath57 gyr and @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> , one would have to , e.g. , push @xmath1 below 67 km / s / mpc to have @xmath64 , and below 50 km / s / mpc to have @xmath65 ( no negative pressure ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we compute the likelihood of no epoch with @xmath66 ( for given @xmath67 ) as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , we assume uncorrelated gaussian errors in all three parameters : @xmath68 gyr , @xmath47 km / s / mpc and @xmath69 ( all one standard deviation ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we assume that the probability distribution for the actual value each of parameter is normal , with maximum at the central value and standard deviation given by the error estimate . </S>",
    "<S> we then compute , for a particular value of @xmath67 , the total probability that the parameters take on values for which inequality ( [ inq ] ) is satisfied . in practice , this was done using monte carlo .    </S>",
    "<S> the results are displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2a ] ( top curve ) . using this error model the probability of no epoch with @xmath3 is less than 4 percent . </S>",
    "<S> this is an _ overestimate _ of the likelihood , since the model allows values of , e.g. , @xmath0 which are much too low : @xmath57 gyr is more plausibly interpreted a strict minimum than minus one standard deviation from the central value . modifying the error model so that values of @xmath70 gyr are not allowed reduces the likelihood of no epoch with @xmath3 to about 1.3 percent . </S>",
    "<S> this is represented by the middle curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2a ] . adding a similar constraint that @xmath71 leads to the lowest curve in the figure , and a likelihood of no epoch with @xmath72 of about 0.8 percent . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3a ] is identical to fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2a ] except that we have increased the one standard deviation error for @xmath1 to @xmath48 7 km / s / mpc ; the existence of dark energy is still strongly favored .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , unless systematic errors are significantly larger than currently recognized , best measurements of the age of the universe @xmath0 , the hubble parameter @xmath1 and the matter fraction @xmath2 strongly favor the existence of a repulsive dominant energy component , also known as dark energy . </S>",
