    "the modern trends in miniaturization of electronic devices eventually led to fabrication of single molecular junctions and molecular transistors ( see e.g. review @xcite ) .",
    "the electric properties of single molecular transistors ( smts ) in many cases are similar to the analogous characteristics of single electron transistors ( sets ) fabricated in two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "smts demonstrate such effects as coulomb blockade and coulomb blockade oscillations on gate voltage .",
    "the significant difference between smt and semiconducting set is that the former can function even at room temperatures that makes them to be very promising basic elements for nanoelectronics .",
    "another specific feature of molecular transistors is the interaction between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "the electron in the process of tunneling through the molecule can excite ( and absorb at finite temperatures ) molecular vibrational quanta ( vibrons ) - the phenomenon known as `` phonon - assisted tunneling '' @xcite . the opening of inelastic channels results in appearance of additional peaks ( side - band peaks ) in differential conductance . for weak electron - vibron interaction",
    "the magnitudes of inelastic peaks are much smaller then the value of the elastic resonance peak .",
    "the situation is changed in the regime of strong electron - vibron interaction when nonperturbative ( and , in particular , polaronic ) effects determine electron transport through a vibrating molecule ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "polaronic effects are most pronounced in the case when the molecule ( quantum dot ) is well - separated from the leads and the width , @xmath0 , of conducting molecular states is small compared to other energy scales ( temperature @xmath1 , driving voltage @xmath2 ) . in this case",
    "the mechanism of electron transport through the vibrating molecule is ( inelastic ) sequential tunneling via the real polaronic intermediate state .",
    "the amplitude of this tunneling is exponentially suppressed since the wave functions of free electron in the leads and polaronic state ( holstein polaron ) in the dot are almost orthogonal .",
    "this effect ( named as frank - condon @xcite,@xcite or polaronic @xcite blockade ) strongly suppresses elastic channel of electron transport and changes the temperature behavior of conductance .",
    "recently , frank - condon blockade was observed in experiment of electron tunneling through a suspended single - wall carbon nanotube @xcite .",
    "a one more novel phenomenon appears for vibrating quantum dot when the matrix element of electron tunneling to the left and to the right lead differently depends on the position of the dot center of mass .",
    "this is always the case when the dot ( molecule ) vibrates in the direction of electron tunneling and then the effect of electron shuttling takes place at finite voltages @xcite-@xcite . in papers",
    "@xcite,@xcite the problem of electron shuttling was considered for a model of single level ( @xmath3 ) vibrating quantum dot weakly coupled to the leads of noninteracting electrons .",
    "it was shown that in the regime of weak electromechanical coupling the shuttle instability occurs at bias voltages @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the vibron energy ) and the increment of instability is @xmath6 . here",

    "both coupling constants @xmath8 , @xmath12 were assumed to be small in refs.@xcite,@xcite .    in the problem of electron shuttling the electron - vibron interaction strength @xmath13 linearly depends on the driving voltage .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently high voltages the regime of strong electron - vibron interaction ( @xmath14 ) is realized . in this regime",

    "the maximum value of the increment is sensitive to value of coupling constant @xmath12 .",
    "the interplay of two effects - the increase of @xmath23 caused by the increase of inelastic channels which contribute to the increment when rising the applied voltage and the decrease of @xmath23 with the increase of bias voltage caused by polaronic blockade - results in oscillation of @xmath23 on small energy scale @xmath5 .",
    "our results show that polaronic effects determine the physics of electron shuttling in the case of moderate or strong mechanical damping when the transition to a shuttle - like regime of electron transport is possible only at sufficiently high bias voltages .",

    "this model was repeatedly considered in the literature for the problem of electron transport in molecular transistors ( see e.g.@xcite and referencies therein ) .",
