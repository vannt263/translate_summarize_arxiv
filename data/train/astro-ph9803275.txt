    "the strength and morphology of the intergalactic magnetic fields remain largely unknown , because it is intrinsically difficult to observe them ( for recent reviews , see kronberg 1994 ; beck et al . 1996 ; zweibel & heiles 1997 ) .",
    "while the magnetic fields inside typical galaxies are observed to be of order of @xmath2 , recent observations indicate that the magnetic fields of the similar strength are also common in core regions of rich clusters ( for a recent discussion see enlin 1997 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper limit for a large - scale field strength placed by the observed rotation measure ( rm ) of quasars is about @xmath3 ( kronberg 1994 ) . here , @xmath4 is the reversal scale of the magnetic fields in units of mpc in comoving coordinates .",
    "it was assumed the fields are uniform in direction within the reversal scale and varied as a comoving passive field in the expansion of the universe .",
    "the above value is close to the limit placed by the observed anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation is @xmath5 ( barrow , ferreira & silk 1997 ) . here",
    ", a uniform magnetic field was assumed .",
    "@xmath6 is @xmath7 in unit of @xmath8 .",
    "according to a recent popular view based on both observational and theoretical cosmology , the dominant nonlinear structure in the universe is a web - like network of filaments ( bond , kofman & pogosyan 1996 ; shectman 1996 ) . at a lower density contrast , however , bubbly walls whose intersections are in fact filaments are the dominant structures .",
    "such large scale structures form via gravitational instability , and then turbulent motions inside the structures as well as streaming motions along the structures necessarily exist ( kang 1994 ) . hence ,",
    "magnetic fields in the early universe , if existed , should have been modified and amplified by those flow motions ( kulsrud & anderson 1992 ; kulsrud 1997 ) . as a result",
    ", we expect that _ the `` geometry '' of cosmic magnetic field , which means the spatial distribution of the field strength and its orientation , should be correlated with the large - scale nonlinear structures of the universe_. in other words , the field strength increases with the matter density and its orientation tends to align with the sheets and filaments , while its random component is associated with the local turbulent motions .",
    "the magnetic fields should be strong along the walls of cosmic bubbles , even stronger along the filamentary superclusters , and the strongest inside the clusters of the galaxies , while they are very weak inside the voids .",
    "based on the proposition that the large scale magnetic field is correlated with the large scale structure of the universe , we consider a way to estimate the field strength which relies on the observational data .",
    "the cosmic magnetic field together with free electrons in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) induces the faraday rotation in polarized radio waves from extra - galactic sources .",
    "the observational rm data of quasars show a systematic growth of rm with redshift , @xmath9 , and limit rm to @xmath10 or less at @xmath11 ( kronberg & simard - normandin 1976 ; kronberg 1994 and references therein ) . adopting a model for the distribution of the large scale magnetic field",
    ", these data can be used to constrain the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "for example , the upper limit estimated by kronberg ( 1994 ) was based on a model in which the field is uniform within the reversal scale , the orientation is random , and there are @xmath12 reversals along the line of sight to a source @xmath13 mpc away from us .    in the present paper ,",
    "we re - derive the upper limit by taking a new model in which the intergalactic magnetic field is mostly confined within filaments and sheets but very weak inside voids , rather than the simple model of uniform field .",
    "of course the field would be strongest inside clusters , but their contribution is usually excluded in the observed rm . if we take only the geometric consideration that the field distribution along the lines of sight to radio sources has a small filling factor , high only inside filaments and sheets but low inside voids , then it is obvious that the expected magnetic field strength in filaments and sheets should be higher than the value derived from the uniform field model .",
    "but this geometric model is too simple , since the electron distribution as well as the field direction are uncertain . here , we take a more practical approach by adopting numerical data in a simulated universe which includes a magnetic field , which is evolved during the large scale structure formation . with the magnetic field distribution , specific to this simulation model , we argue that the magnetic field strength in filaments and sheets is limited to @xmath14 .",
    "we should emphasize that _ this limit should be approximately valid regardless of details of any model for the origin of the large scale magnetic field , provided that it is correlated with the large scale structure of the universe_.    in the next section , we describe the model simulation and the resulting magnetic field geometry . in  3 , we explain the procedure to calculate the upper limit of the magnetic field strength in filaments and sheets constrained by the observed rm . in the final section ,",
    "we discuss the implications of the possible existence of @xmath15 or less magnetic field in filaments and sheets .",
    "in this section we describe one particular simulation of the origin and growth of magnetic fields , but will retain at the end only the geometry and the _ relative _ strength of the magnetic fields across the cosmological structures .",
    "it is this structure for which we require a realistic simulation to probe the universe for its rotation measure across a large number of simulated paths .",
    "the generation of the large scale magnetic field by the biermann battery mechanism ( l. biermann 1950 ) and its subsequent evolution has been followed by solving the equation @xmath16 along with the cosmological hydrodynamic equations . here , @xmath17 is the electron pressure and @xmath18 is the electron number density . the simulation has been done with a version of the cosmological hydrodynamic code which extends the one described in ryu ( 1993 ) by incorporating the above equation `` passively '' .",
    "that is , the lorenz force term in the momentum equation has been ignored .",
    "alternatively , the equation for the magnetic field could have been incorporated by solving the full mhd equations .",
    "then the code would have been more diffusive .    a standard cold dark matter",
    "( cdm ) model universe with total @xmath19 has been simulated in a periodic box with @xmath20 volume using @xmath21 cells and @xmath22 particles from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "the values of other parameters used are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "a more detailed description of the simulation can be found in in kulsrud ( 1997 ) .    in the simulations which include the evolution of baryonic matter as well as that of dark matter , accretion shocks form in the infalling flows towards the growing nonlinear structures such as sheets , filaments and clusters ( kang 1994 ; ryu & kang 1997b ) .",
    "we note that some evidence has been found in radio relic sources , that these accretion shocks have actually been detected ( enlin 1998 ) .",
    "the properties of the shocks depend upon the power spectrum of the initial perturbations on a given scale as well as the background expansion in a given cosmological model .",
    "these shocks are the sites of the generation of weak seed field by the battery mechanism represented by the last term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ b_noncos ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the strength of the seed field generated was plotted in figure 1 of kulsrud ( 1997 ) .",
    "it grows monotonically to the mass averaged value of order @xmath28 by @xmath29 , and then levels off without further increase .",
    "the saturation is believed to be due to the finite numerical resistivity inherent in the numerical scheme used to solve eq .",
    "( [ b_noncos ] ) . at the saturation ,",
    "the magnetic energy is much smaller ( by @xmath30 ) than the kinetic energy .",
    "so the dynamical influence of magnetic field into flow motion can be ignored , and neglecting the lorenz force in the momentum equation is justified .    to illustrate the general characteristics of the field geometry in relation to the matter distribution and flow velocity , a two - dimensional cut of the simulated box is presented in figure 1 .",
    "the plot shows a region of @xmath31 with a thickness of @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "the three panels display baryonic density contours , velocity vectors , and magnetic field vectors .",
    "we can see accretion shocks around the high density structures of clusters , filaments , and sheets in the density contours .",
    "the locations of the shocks can be seen more clearly in the velocity vector plot where accretion motions stop suddenly . in the highest density regions of clusters ,",
    "flow motion is turbulent .",
    "also we can see the streaming flow motion along the structures , that is , the accretion motion towards clusters in filaments and the accretion motion towards filaments in sheets . on the top of the streaming motion",
    ", we expect some amount of turbulent motion which is induced by the cooling , gravitational , and nonlinear thin shell instabilities in filaments and sheets ( vishniac 1994 ; anninos , norman & anninos 1995 ; valinia 1997 ) .",
    "so the magnetic field in filaments and sheets could have been stretched by the streaming motion as well as amplified by the turbulent motion . as a result , the amplified magnetic field in filaments and sheets",
    "is expected to be aligned with the structures , as shown in figure 1 .    here , we propose that _ the geometry of the magnetic field in the simulated universe , with an arbitrary normalization for the field strength , represents the geometry of the real magnetic field correlated with the large scale structure of the universe_. thus we take from the simulation only the geometry of the field distribution and its relative strength across the spatial distribution .",
    "we have calculated the expected rms induced by the magnetic field in filaments and sheets in the simulated universe and compared them with the observed upper limit of rm of distant quasars .",
    "due to the field reversal of randomly oriented magnetic field along lines of sight , the rms from sources at a given redshift have a gaussian distribution centered at zero and its standard deviation gives a statistical measure for the field strength .",
    "the standard deviation of the distribution of the rms from quasars at @xmath34 is @xmath35 ( kronberg 1994 ) .",
    "the rm which measures the amount of the rotation is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the rotated angle , @xmath38 is the wavelength of the polarized wave along the propagating path , @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the observed wavelength , and @xmath41 is the magnetic field component along @xmath39 ( shu 1991 ) .",
    "the rm for a source at a given redshift @xmath9 can be calculated numerically by the following line integral @xmath42 where @xmath39 is the comoving length in the unit of mpc , @xmath41 is the proper magnetic field in @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the comoving electron number density in @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the baryonic density as a fraction of the critical density , and @xmath47 is the ionization fraction . the integration length @xmath39 is related to the redshift by the following equation @xmath48 in the calculation , we have assumed the gas inside filaments and sheets is fully ionized ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the simulated _ distributions _ of the gas and magnetic field at @xmath33 , 0.5 , 1 , and 2 have been used , and they have been interpolated in between to integrate the above equation up to @xmath11 .    for the relative growth of the field strength for @xmath50 , however , we need to adopt a model , since the numerical simulation could not follow the growth of magnetic field in detail due to numerical resistivity . again",
    ", the normalization of the field strength is arbitrary . considering that theoretical studies on dynamo processes on large scales do not yet provide a unambiguous model",
    ", we assume for simplicity that the magnetic field has reached an `` equipartition '' with the energy in turbulence . then its energy should be proportional to the kinetic energy which is , in turn , proportional to the gravitational potential energy .",
    "then , the self - similar solution for an @xmath19 universe gives @xmath51 where @xmath52 is for sheets , 2 for filaments , and @xmath53 for clusters ( fillmore & goldreich 1984 ) .",
    "here , @xmath54 is the parameter which characterizes the initial perturbation of the self - similar solution and has @xmath55 . hence , for filaments and sheets , we expect @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "however , we have also considered the model in which the magnetic field grows as time passes ( welter , perry , & kronberg 1984 ) .",
    "so , we have explored the cases of @xmath58 .",
    "this large range of the parameter @xmath59 explored here should encompass many models for the origin of magnetic fields in the cosmos ( see , the discussions in l. biermann 1950 ; parker 1958 ; rees 1987 ; beck 1996 ; p. biermann 1997 ; kronberg & lesch 1997 ) .    with the above prescription for the evolution of magnetic field in filaments and sheets , we have integrated eq .",
    "( [ rm_cosmo ] ) up to @xmath11 along @xmath60 randomly chosen paths .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of the expected rms for the model with @xmath61 .",
    "the magnetic field is normalized so that the standard deviation of the gaussian fit ( the solid line ) to the expected rms matches the observational upper limit of @xmath62 . with this normalization for the field strength ,",
    "the upper limits in the rms of magnetic field in filaments and sheets can be calculated for several models .",
    "they are given in table 1 for the several values of @xmath59 , and they are @xmath15 for @xmath26 .",
    "= 3.3 in    .upper limits on the magnetic field strength in filaments and sheets [ cols=\"^,>,^ \" , ]     @xmath63 the exponent in the temporal evolution of magnetic field in filaments and sheets , @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 the rms of magnetic field in filaments and sheets at the present epoch @xmath66 in units of @xmath43 for @xmath26 .",
    "figure 3 shows the distributions of gas density and magnetic field strength along the line drawn in the first panel of figure 1 for the case with @xmath61 .",
    "we can see the field strength correlates well with the gas density and ranges @xmath67 in the regions of filaments and sheets .",
    "= 3.2 in    these numbers clearly demonstrate that the essential result is nearly independent of any of the details about the origin of the magnetic field , since for the entire range of values tested in @xmath59 we obtain to within a factor of a few the same result : the upper limit to the magnetic field in the sheet is of order @xmath0 .",
    "our result indicates that , with the present value of the observed limit in rm , the existence of magnetic field of up to @xmath15 in filaments and sheets can not be ruled out , if the cosmic magnetic field is preferentially distributed in these nonlinear structures , rather than uniformly distributed in the intergalactic space .",
    "_ we emphasize that this result is independent of the details of how the magnetic field originated .",
    "_ however , it is not certain if the dynamo processes such as the one considered in kulsrud ( 1997 ) can amplify a week seed field to the above field strength .",
    "interestingly , there is confirmation of such a magnetic field in one case .",
    "kim ( 1989 ) reported the possible existence of a intercluster magnetic field of @xmath68 in the plane of the coma / abell 1367 supercluster .",
    "they reached the result from the observation using high dynamic range synchrotron images at @xmath69 .",
    "clearly , this result should be confirmed in other regions of the sky with the newly available possibilities of low radio frequency interferometry such as with the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) in india , or the new receiver systems on the very large array ( vla ) in the usa .",
    "we may compare the above upper limit with the strength of the magnetic field whose energy is in equipartition with the thermal energy of the gas in filaments and sheets .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field strength can be written as @xmath70 the fiducial values @xmath71 and @xmath72 may considered to be appropriate for filaments ( see , kang 1994 and figure 3 ) .",
    "the values appropriate for sheets should be somewhat smaller .",
    "so , our upper limit set by rm is close to , but several times larger than , the equipartition magnetic field strength .",
    "filaments and sheets with the above fiducial temperature and gas density can contribute radiation at x - ray wavelengths to the cosmological background . using the above values and a typical size of @xmath73mpc ,",
    "the luminosity of filaments and sheets in the soft x - ray band ( @xmath74kev ) is expected to be @xmath75 . actually , soltan ( 1996 ) and miyaji ( 1996 ) reported the detection of extended x - ray emission from structures of a comparable size and a luminosity of @xmath76 , which is correlated to abell clusters .",
    "these observations suggest that the temperature and gas density outside clusters could even be considerably larger than the fiducial values assumed above . in any case , if these observations can be further confirmed , and the equipartition of magnetic field and gas energies is assumed , it would imply the existence of a @xmath77 magnetic field on large scales outside galaxy clusters .",
    "the possible existence of strong magnetic field of @xmath78 or less in filaments and sheets has many astrophysical implications , some of which we briefly outline in the following :    the large - scale accretion shocks where seed magnetic fields could be generated are probably the biggest shocks in the universe with a typical size @xmath79 a few ( 1 - 10 ) mpc and very strong with a typical accretion velocity @xmath79 a few @xmath80 .",
    "the accretion velocity onto the shocks around clusters of a given temperature , or a give mass to radius ratio @xmath81 , is smaller in a universe with smaller @xmath82 , and is given as @xmath83^{1/2}$ ] in model universes with @xmath84 ( ryu & kang 1997a ) .",
    "with up to @xmath15 or less magnetic field around them , the large - scale accretion shocks could serve as possible sites for the acceleration of high energy cosmic rays by the first - order fermi process ( kang , ryu & jones 1996 ; kang , rachen & biermann 1997 ) .",
    "although the shocks around clusters would be the most efficient sites for acceleration , those around filaments and sheets could make a significant contribution as well ( norman , melrose & achterberg 1995 ) . with the particle diffusion model in quasi - perpendicular shocks ( jokipii 1987 ) , the observed cosmic ray spectrum near @xmath85 could be explained with reasonable parameters if about @xmath86 of the infalling kinetic energy can be injected into the intergalactic space as the high energy particles ( if an @xmath87 spectrum of cosmic rays is assumed ; for a slightly steeper spectrum as suggested by radio relic sources , the efficiency is closer to 0.1 , enlin 1998 ) .",
    "the discoveries of several reliable events of high energy cosmic rays at an energy above @xmath88 raise questions about their origin and path in the universe ( a recent review is p. biermann 1997 ) , since their interaction with the cosmic microwave background radiation limits the distances to their sources to less than 100 mpc , perhaps within our local supercluster .",
    "the haverah park and akeno data indicate that their arrival directions are in some degree correlated with the direction of the supergalactic plane ( stanev 1995 ; hayashida 1996 ; uchihori 1996 ) . in biermann ,",
    "kang & ryu ( 1996 ) , we noted that if the magnetic field of @xmath77 or less exists inside our local supercluster and there exist accretion flows infalling toward the supergalactic plane , it is possible that the high energy cosmic rays above the so - called gzk cutoff ( @xmath89 ev ) can be confined to the supergalactic plane sheet , an effect analogous to solar wind modulation . in each case",
    "a shock front pushes energetic particles upstream as seen from its flow .",
    "obviously , this effect would occur only for a small part of phase space , namely those particles with a sufficiently small initial momentum transverse to the sheet .",
    "this would explain naturally the correlation between the arrival direction of the high energy cosmic rays and the supergalactic plane .",
    "also , confinement means that for all the particles captured into the sheets , the dilution with distance @xmath90 is @xmath91 instead of @xmath92 , increasing the cosmic ray flux from any source appreciably with respect to the three - dimensional dilution .",
    "so we may see sources to much larger distances than expected so far . on the other hand , particles with a larger initial momentum transverse to the sheet",
    "would be strongly scattered , obliterating all source information from their arrival direction at earth .    with the magnetic field in the intergalactic medium , charged particles passing it would not only experience deflection .",
    "it would also smear out their arrival direction as well as delay their arrival time .",
    "plaga ( 1995 ) suggested that an exhibition of this latter effect would be the delay of the arrival times of @xmath93-rays from a cascade caused by photons from highly time - variable extragalactic sources .",
    "however , with strong fields of @xmath15 or less in filaments and sheets intervening between the sources and us , the expected consequence would be a strong smearing of the sources rather than the delay of arrival times ( kronberg 1995 ) .",
    "but , for details , calculations following the propagation of photons and charged particles should be done .",
    "another interesting exploration is to study the radiation emission arising from filaments and sheets strong magnetic field of @xmath78 or less .",
    "we noted that the original estimate of the magnetic field in the plane of the coma / abell 1367 supercluster was based on a synchrotron radio continuum measurement ( kim 1989 ) .",
    "we also noted that the thermal bremsstrahlung emission in the soft x - ray band may provide an interesting check on the work presented here .",
    "whether these structures can contribute at other wavelengths , such as @xmath93-ray energies , to the cosmological background remains an an unanswered but challenging question at this time .",
    "these issues will be discussed elsewhere .",
