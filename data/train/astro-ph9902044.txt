    "near  infrared ( near  ir ) imaging surveys have resulted in the discovery of a population of infrared  bright , extremely red objects ( ` eros ' ) , which may be of significance to studies of galaxy evolution .",
    "eros , which we define in this paper as having observed optical  near - ir colors @xmath10 , have been identified both in the field , and around high - redshift radio galaxies and quasars ( elston , rieke , & rieke 1988 , 1989 , 1991 ; mccarthy , persson , & west 1992 ; eisenhardt & dickinson 1992 ; graham et al .",
    "1994 ; hu & ridgway 1994 ; dey , spinrad , & dickinson 1995 ) .",
    "images of eros from ground  based telescopes show that they are spatially extended on scales of @xmath11 .",
    "this suggests that eros are probably galaxies rather than stellar objects ( e.g. , brown dwarfs ) .",
    "most eros were not _ a priori _ selected as radio sources and are generally radio quiet .",
    "extremely faint optically ( @xmath12 ) , their distances and spectral properties ( i.e. , whether they are normal or active galaxies ) remain unknown .    the extreme colors of these objects might be attributed either to an old stellar population , or to a younger stellar population reddened by dust ( graham & dey 1996 , hereafter gd96 ; yamada et al .",
    "1997 ) . the spectral energy distributions ( hereafter seds ) of the reddest eros",
    "known are inconsistent with unreddened old populations at any redshift , and suggest that they must be highly reddened starburst galaxies , perhaps the distant counterparts of the local ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; e.g. , soifer et al .",
    "1984 ) discovered by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( ) .",
    "most eros have been discovered serendipitously , and their space densities are therefore uncertain .",
    "some measurements suggest that the most extreme eros ( , those as red as 10 ) are as abundant as quasars , with a surface density in blank fields @xmath13arcmin@xmath14 ( hu & ridgway 1994 ; cowie et al .  1994 ) .",
    "more recent measurements suggest that the surface density of objects with @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath17arcmin@xmath14 ( beckwith 1998 ) with fainter eros possibly having even higher surface densities ( @xmath18arcmin@xmath14 for eros with @xmath19 ; eisenhardt 1998 ) .",
    "there is also some evidence that their surface density is higher in regions around high - redshift radio galaxies and quasars compared with the general field ( e.g. , aragon - salamanca et al .",
    "1994 ; dey , spinrad , & dickinson 1995 ; yamada et al .",
    "an obvious interpretation of this result is that the eros are clustered around and hence physically associated with the distant , luminous agn , which would imply that eros are at @xmath20 and their rest - frame optical luminosities are 520 times more luminous than unevolved @xmath21 ellipticals at the same redshifts .",
    "alternatively , this excess number density may suggest that our samples of distant luminous agn are biased due to gravitational lensing by foreground mass concentrations with which the eros are associated .",
    "given that the eros may constitute a significant population in our universe , it is important to understand their nature . in this paper",
    "we present new optical , near - ir and sub - mm observations (   2 ) of ero  j164502 + 4626.4 , an ero discovered in the field of the @xmath22 quasar pc1643 + 4631 ( object # 10 of hu & ridgway 1994 ) ' 10 ( e.g. , graham & dey 1996 ; cimatti 1998 ) .",
    "the nomenclature used in this paper follows the iau recommendations for source names . ] .",
    "our new observations convincingly demonstrate that 10  is a @xmath0 luminous , dusty starburst galaxy , a distant counterpart of local ulirgs like arp  220 and mrk  231 , as originally suggested by gd96 (   3 ) .",
    "the detection of 10   at sub - mm wavelengths , and the relatively large surface density of the ero population suggests that these objects may be candidates for the sub - mm emitters recently discovered in deep scuba surveys ( smail 1997 , blain 1999a , hughes 1998 , barger 1998 ) , and we briefly discuss this possibility and its consequences in   3.5 .",
    "we assume @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 throughout .",
    "for this cosmology , the luminosity distance of 10   is 10.53@xmath26  gpc . for = 0.1 ,",
    "the luminosity distance is larger by a factor of 1.286 .",
    "the field of pc  1643 + 4631 was observed using the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ; trauger 1994 , holtzman 1995 ) on the refurbished _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ through the f814w filter on ut 1997 may 7 . a position angle ( p.a . ) of 68.2  was used in order to simultaneously observe both ero  j164502 + 4626.4 and ero  j164457 + 4626.0 ( objects # 10 and 14 of hu & ridgway 1994 ) .",
    "both objects were targetted on the wf ccds in order to optimize the detection of faint diffuse emission .",
    "we obtained 4 exposures over 2 orbits with the telescope dithered by @xmath27 between orbits .",
    "the total integration time was 5300  sec .",
    "the images resulting from the calibration pipeline were corrected for cosmic rays , registered and coadded .",
    "flux calibration was performed using the photometric zero points of holtzman ( 1995 ) .",
    "the final image reaches a 3@xmath28 limiting surface brightness of 26.77  ab  @xmath29 in an 1  aperture .",
    "the wfpc2 f814w image of 10  ( rotated to a normal orientation where north is up and east is to the left ) is shown in figure  [ hr10f814 ] .",
    "the galaxy is extended by roughly 09 in @xmath30 in a reflected ` s  shaped ' morphology that is suggestive of an interacting system or spiral / tidal arms .",
    "we spatially coregistered the _",
    "image with the near  ir",
    "@xmath31band image of gd96 using 16 common objects ; the relative positional accuracy is better than 002 .",
    "a comparison of the f814w and @xmath31band images reveals that the bulk of the near  ir emission arises from a region of low optical flux , in between the two bright lobes of optical emission ( the ends of the reflected ` s ' ; figure  [ hr10cont ] ) .",
    "the brightest region of optical emission is _ not _ cospatial with the peak of the near  ir emission , but instead lies @xmath32 south of it ( figure  [ hr10cont ] ) .    in a 3  diameter aperture , 10",
    "is found to have a magnitude of @xmath33  ab mag ( at @xmath34 ) or , equivalently , a cousins @xmath35-band magnitude of @xmath36 .",
    "the color of 10  in this aperture is then @xmath37 , consistent with the values quoted by gd96 and hr94 .",
    "the magnitudes of the northern and southern optical lobes , measured in apertures of diameter 05 , are @xmath38  ab mag and @xmath39  ab mag respectively .",
    "we obtained optical spectra of 10   on u.t .",
    "1998 may 4 using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke 1995 ) at the cassegrain focus of the keck ii telescope .",
    "the observations were made in good seeing ( fwhm @xmath40 ) through a 10 wide slit oriented in p.a .",
    "lris was configured with the 400 line  @xmath41 grating ( @xmath42 ; @xmath43 ) , and the spectra cover the wavelength range @xmath44 .",
    "the total exposure time was 3 hours , and the target was dithered along the slit after every 30  min sub - exposure in order to allow for proper fringe removal and sky subtraction .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using near lamps obtained immediately following the 10   observations , and relative flux calibration was performed using observations of the standard stars wolf  1346 and feige  34 ( massey 1988 , massey & gronwall 1990 ) .",
    "although the observations were made under non - photometric conditions , the spectrum was scaled to an absolute scale using published photometry ( gd96 , hu & ridgway 1996 ) .",
    "the sky - subtracted two - dimensional spectrum is shown in figure  [ 2dspectrum ] , and the extracted one - dimensional spectrum ( extracted in a 17 aperture ) and the corresponding 1@xmath28 errors are presented in figure  [ optspectrum ] .",
    "the notable features in the optical spectrum are a strong emission line at @xmath459090  ( which corresponds to the [ oii]@xmath463726,3729 doublet at @xmath47 ) and a very red continuum emission ( @xmath48 in the wavelength range @xmath49 ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum is too poor to convincingly detect any absorption lines or spectral breaks . the measured flux , fwhm and rest frame equivalent width of [ oii]@xmath463726,3729 are presented in table  [ emlines ] .",
    "near - ir spectroscopy of 10   was obtained using the cryogenic spectrograph ( crsp ; joyce 1995 ) at the cassegrain focus of the kpno 4 m mayall telescope on the night of u.t .",
    "1997 june 21 .",
    "crsp was configured with grating # 4 ( 200 @xmath50 , @xmath51 , dispersion @xmath52 ) used in 2nd order and a 10 slit to provide a resolution fwhm of 0.0042  over the wavelength range 1.444  to 1.750 . observations of 10   were obtained by dithering the object along the slit ; each dither sequence consisted of five equally spaced target positions along the slit separated by 8 .",
    "the slit was oriented at p.a.=59.3  in order to include a nearby galaxy ( object 6 in figure  [ hr10f814 ] ; our notation follows that of hr94 ) to aid in accurately coadding the data .",
    "each individual observation was 3  min long , and the total exposure time was 195  min .",
    "the seeing during the observations was typically 08 in the @xmath31band .",
    "the atmospheric absorption was corrected using observations of the telluric standard hr6064 ( g1v ) obtained at various airmasses both preceding and following the 10   observations .",
    "the spectral frames were dark - subtracted , flat - fielded , rectified , sky - subtracted , and coadded by using object 6 ( see figure  [ hr10f814 ] ) to determine the accurate relative offsets .",
    "the sky subtraction of each spectral frame was performed using a ` local ' sky constructed from the median of the four preceding and four following frames .",
    "the summed two - dimensional spectrum is shown in the upper panel of figure  [ 2dspectrum ] .",
    "the extracted spectrum was divided by the mean spectrum of the telluric standards to correct for the telluric absorption , and corrected for the stellar features by multiplying by the mean spectrum of a g0v star constructed by averaging the spectra of hd109358 and hr5868 from the near - ir spectral atlas of lancon and rocca - volmerange ( 1992 ) .",
    "since the continuum emission from 10  is only marginally detected in these observations , the telluric corrections are largely unnecessary , but also provide us with a rough relative flux calibration .",
    "the resulting spectrum was then scaled by a constant to be consistent with the @xmath53-band flux of 10 .",
    "the calibrated near ",
    "ir spectrum of 10  is shown in figure  [ irspectrum ] , and clearly shows the emission line detected by gd96 .",
    "the line is narrow , and appears to be resolved into at least two components .",
    "the ratio of the wavelengths of the two brighter components roughly matches the ratio of [ ] @xmath456584/ , and is consistent with the original identification ( by gd96 ) of the line as + [ ] .",
    "the extracted spectrum also shows a weak feature at the expected location of the [ sii]@xmath466717,6731 doublet . however , given the signal - to - noise ratio of the present data , we caution that the [ nii]@xmath456584 and the [ sii]@xmath466717,6731 detections are marginal , and should be treated accordingly ( , figure  [ irspectrum ] ) .",
    "the emission line measurements are presented in table  [ emlines ] .",
    "the numbers in this table were derived by using the specfit software ( kriss 1994 ) as implemented in _",
    "iraf _ to fit gaussians to the emission lines in the calibrated unsmoothed spectrum .",
    "the h@xmath54 and [ nii]@xmath456584 emission lines were fit jointly by requiring the two features to have equal width and holding the ratio of their central wavelengths constant .",
    "the new high - resolution near - ir observation presented here provides a more accurate measurement of the equivalent widths and fwhms of the h@xmath54 and [ nii ] emission lines . in these new higher spectral resolution data ,",
    "the emission lines are found to be narrower and have smaller equivalent widths than those derived by gd96 .",
    "data were obtained during 1997 june , july and december , and 1998 january and february using the sub - mm common - user bolometer array ( scuba ; holland et al .",
    "scuba has two arrays of bolometric detectors which are operated at 0.1  k to achieve sky background - limited performance on the telescope at 350450 and 750850 .",
    "three extra bolometers  ` photometric pixels ' optimized for use at 1100 , 1350 and 2000   are positioned around the long - wave array .",
    "photometry of sources significantly smaller than the beam are generally performed using the central pixels of each array , which are aligned to within an arcsecond of each other , or the photometric pixels .",
    "the best photometric accuracy is achieved by averaging the source signal over a slightly larger area than the beam , so the secondary mirror was ` jiggled ' in a filled - square , 9-point pattern , covering @xmath55 . during the ` jiggle '",
    "the secondary mirror was chopped azimuthally by 60  at 6.944hz .",
    "after the first 9  sec ` jiggle ' , the telescope was nodded azimuthally to the reference position ( subsequently every 18  sec ) . at 450  and 850",
    ", we spent 260min on source , with a further 165min at 1350 .",
    "skydips were performed before , during and after the target measurements to determine the zenith opacities , and the telescope pointing accuracy was checked regularly using 1633 + 382 and 3c345 .",
    "all data were calibrated against observations of mars and uranus .",
    "the observing conditions during the scuba runs were excellent , especially during the early 1998 observing periods .",
    "reduction of the 450  and 850  data consisted of taking the measurements from the central bolometer , rejecting spikes , and averaging over 18  sec time intervals .",
    "the signal detected by all the bolometers is dominated by spatially correlated sky emission ( ivison et al .",
    "1998a ) , so data from the adjacent rings of bolometers were treated in a similar manner .",
    "the residual sky background was removed using the median of the inner two rings of pixels , after rejecting those with excessive noise .",
    "this reduced the noise - equivalent flux density at 850to around 90mjyhz@xmath56 , suggesting that the effects of rapid sky variability have been removed entirely .",
    "reduction of the 1350data followed a similar process , though without the removal of sky noise .    at 850",
    ", we find a clear detection of 10  at a level well above the expected extrapolation of the weak radio emission ; at 450 and 1350 , the detection significance is lower , but the measured flux densities are @xmath57 detections , and are entirely consistent with thermal emission from optically thin dust .",
    "the flux density measurements at 450 , 850  and 1350  are reported in table  [ submmdata ] .",
    "the 850  and 1350  flux densities reported in this paper are roughly half the values reported by cimatti ( 1998 ) .",
    "our more extensive dataset was obtained during exceptional observing conditions , as evident from the 450  detection , and we can exclude a substantially higher flux with some confidence . furthermore , our data were obtained using a single telescope with internally consistent flux calibration , and the 450  and 850  photometric data were obtained simultaneously .",
    "hence , the relative photometry ( and the derived spectral index ) are self consistent and more accurate than other sub - mm measurements of 10  presented to date . there also exist 95  and 175  observations of 10  obtained with the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) , which can provide additional consistency checks on the sub - mm observations .",
    "we will report on these _ iso _ observations in a forthcoming work by ivison ( 1999 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic observations presented in this paper confirm the @xmath58 redshift of the galaxy by resolving the emission line reported by gd96 into two components which match the h - alpha + [ nii ] identification , the detection of the [ oii]@xmath463726,3729 doublet , and the marginal detection of the [ sii]@xmath466717,6731 emission lines at the same redshift .    the h@xmath54/[nii]@xmath456584 ratio ( @xmath59 ) and the relatively narrow linewidths of the [ oii ] and h@xmath54 emission lines suggest that the ionization is more likely to be due to young , hot stars than an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the spectrum of 10  is similar to that observed in local star  forming galaxies ( , kennicutt 1992 ) .",
    "the fwhm ( deconvolved fwhm @xmath60 ) of the [ oii ] doublet and equivalent width of the h@xmath54 emission line from 10  are more typical of star  forming galaxies than agn ( , liu & kennicutt 1995 ) . however , since an agn could be hidden behind dust and rendered invisible at rest frame optical and ultraviolet wavelengths , a firm statement on the nature of the energy source must await future mid- and far - infrared spectroscopy . in the following discussion",
    ", we assume that young stars power the entire far - infrared emission from 10 .",
    "the _ hst  _ wfpc2 image ( figures  [ hr10f814 ] and [ hr10cont ] ) clearly shows that 10   has an elongated and distorted morphology . at a redshift of 1.44 , the wfpc2 f814w filter samples the rest - frame wavelength range @xmath462900@xmath613900 ( i.e. , roughly rest - frame @xmath62-band light ) , which includes the [ ] @xmath463726,3729 emission doublet . the equivalent width of this emission feature in 10   implies that the emission line contamination in the f814w filter is @xmath638% ; the observed morphology is therefore dominated by the continuum emission from the galaxy . since the filter samples the continuum at near - uv wavelengths just shortward of the 4000  break ,",
    "the morphology observed in the _ hst  _ image only reflects the distribution of uv bright populations ( , hot , young stars ) , and in addition may be heavily modified by the distribution of dust in the galaxy .",
    "the peculiar uv morphology may be due to spiral arms , tidal features or something more complex , and suggests that 10   may be an interacting or distorted system .    the most striking aspect of the rest frame near ",
    "uv morphology is that it is very different from the rest frame far  red morphology observed in the @xmath31band : the red emission is more symmetric ( at least at the 06 resolution of the gd96 ground - based image ) and peaks in a region where the near  uv emission falls to a minimum , approximately at the center of the reflected s  shaped structure seen in the wfpc2 image ( figure  [ hr10cont ] ) . since the far  red emission in galaxies is generally dominated by late type giant stars and an older main sequence population and the near  uv emission is dominated by younger , hotter stars , the observed morphological difference could be partly due to spatially distinct populations , with the older stars being more centrally concentrated ( perhaps in a bulge ? ) compared to the younger stars ( perhaps in a disk or tidal arms ? ) .",
    "is it possible that the uv morphology is dominated by young super star clusters ?",
    "the specific luminosities of the northern and southern lobes observed in the near  uv ( @xmath64 ) image are @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "therefore , these regions have luminosities that are at least 3 times larger than the brightest of the super star clusters observed in local starburst galaxies ( , meurer 1995 ) , and it is possible that these regions are composed of groups of star clusters .",
    "we have not corrected the observed flux densities for the effects of extinction due to dust , and the luminosities quoted should be regarded as lower limits .    however , since the extreme red color of 10   requires a significant amount of dust , the observed morphological difference could also be produced by a spatially non - uniform dust distribution which reddens the central regions more than the outer structure .",
    "indeed , the colors in any resolution element are redder than any reasonable stellar population , implying that the entire visible spatial extent of the galaxy is strongly reddened .",
    "it is intriguing that similar uv / optical morphological differences are observed in the inner regions of some nearby ulirgs where they are commonly interpreted as resulting from spatial differences in the dust extinction .",
    "the sed of 10   is remarkably similar to those of low redshift ultraluminous galaxies like arp  220 and mrk  231 ( figure  [ hr10sed ] ) , and this strongly suggests that 10   is a dust  enshrouded system .",
    "the measured sub - millimeter flux densities at 450 , 850  and 1350  are greatly in excess of the power - law extrapolation of the non - thermal radio emission , and it is therefore safe to assume that the sub - millimeter flux results from thermal emission from dust heated by an agn or in star forming regions . the mm / sub - mm spectral index is also consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "if we assume that the sed of 10   is indeed identical to that of the local ulirgs , we can estimate the luminosity and mass of the warm dust responsible for the thermal emission , and attempt to constrain the star ",
    "formation rates necessary to power this galaxy . using the template",
    "sed of an luminous _ iras _ galaxy compiled by guiderdoni ( 1998 ) , we find that a least squares fit of the guiderdoni sed to the three sub - mm points give a bolometric luminosity of @xmath67 with reduced @xmath68 ( figure  [ hr10sedmod ] ) .",
    "almost all of this emission emerges in the far infrared : @xmath69 , where we have defined @xmath70 as the luminosity emerging between rest wavelengths of 10  and 2  cm .",
    "this ranks 10   among the most luminous ( unlensed ) ir galaxies known , and classifies it as an ulirg .",
    "note that the above estimate of the bolometric luminosity requires a large extrapolation .",
    "the sub - mm luminosity ( estimated from @xmath71 $ ] , , the best - determined sub - mm flux ) is @xmath72 , and so this is an extrapolation of two orders of magnitude .",
    "however , the sub - mm flux densities are well  fit by optically thin thermal dust emission with an emissivity law with index 1.5 ( , @xmath73 ) and temperature of @xmath74 k. this dust temperature is typical of ulirgs ( klaas & elsasser 1993 ) .",
    "these modified black body model fits to the sub - mm data have steeper spectra than the guiderdoni sed at @xmath75 , and result in slightly lower values of @xmath70 .",
    "however , although the sub - mm data are all on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the dust emisssion and therefore do not strongly constrain the dust temperature , the small @xmath76 of the fit and the reasonable value of the derived dust temperature suggest that our estimate of the far - infrared luminosity is uncertain by at most a factor of two . the corresponding mass of dust",
    "is @xmath77 for optically thin emission from grains with normal interstellar parameters ( draine & lee 1984 , hildebrand 1983 ) .",
    "the star formation rates can be estimated from either the h@xmath54 luminosity or the sub - mm continuum luminosity only if we assume that young , hot stars provide the energy source for the line and thermal continuum emission .    for our adopted cosmology ( = 50@xmath78  and = 0.5 ) ,",
    "the luminosity in the h@xmath54 emission line is @xmath79 .",
    "if this emission line is powered entirely by young , hot stars , then its luminosity implies a total star  formation rate of @xmath80 ( kennicutt 1983 ) .",
    "this is almost certainly a lower limit to the true star formation rate in the galaxy , since we have not made any corrections for the dust extinction .",
    "a more reliable estimate for the star formation rate in 10   can be derived under the assumption that the sub - mm continuum excess is due to thermal emission from dust grains heated by young , hot stars .",
    "if stars are formed at a constant rate over @xmath81  yr with a salpeter initial mass function ( @xmath82 ; @xmath83  ) , a luminosity of @xmath84 corresponds to a star formation rate  between @xmath85 ( leitherer and heckman 1995 ) .",
    "therefore the observed bolometric luminosity corresponds to a total star formation rate of @xmath86 ( or a factor of three smaller for the formation rate of only massive stars ) .",
    "a different estimate for the formation rate of massive stars can be derived by relating the total luminosity to the mass consumption rate in early type stars .",
    "scoville & young ( 1983 ) derive @xmath87 , which implies a formation rate of @xmath88 for the massive stars .",
    "note that this estimate does not account for the formation of lower mass stars , the mass cycled through or locked up in lower mass stars and their remnants .",
    "this star formation rate is therefore a lower limit , and as such is consistent with the estimates derived above using the leitherer & heckman ( 1983 ) starburst models .",
    "if the sub - mm luminosity is indeed powered by young stars , the derived star formation rate is @xmath89 times greater than that inferred from the h@xmath54 luminosity ; if this difference is due to dust extinction by a foreground screen , it implies an extinction of @xmath90  mag . for a galactic extinction curve , this would imply that the intrinsic ratio of [ ] to h@xmath54 of @xmath91}/f_{\\rm h\\alpha})_0 \\approx 1.3 $ ] , which is at the extreme limit of observed values for local star forming galaxies ( , kennicutt 1992 ) .",
    "since the dust is more likely to be intermixed with the line - emitting gas than external to it , the extinction derived by comparing the sub - mm and h@xmath54 luminosities may not be directly applicable to the reddening correction of the emission line ratios .",
    "the @xmath92 inferred here is about 2.5 mag larger than that estimated by fitting the 10   optical and near - ir flux densities with a reddened sb galaxy model sed ( gd96 ) .",
    "the star formation rate derived from the sub - mm continuum emission is extremely large and may lead us to the conclusion that the dust emission is powered by an agn rather than by star formation .",
    "indeed , the source of the large luminosities in local ulirgs is still a matter of debate ( , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "however , there is no evidence from the existing spectroscopy that this is the case : as noted in   3.1 , the emission line ratios and widths are more typical of starburst galaxies than agn .",
    "the dust mass estimate from the previous section and the star formation rate derived here can be combined to yield a crude order - of - magnitude estimate for the lifetime of the starburst . assuming that 10   has a ` normal ' gas - to - dust ratio of 0.01 , the total mass of gas is @xmath93 , and the lifetime of the burst is @xmath94 yr . the total mass of stars produced is @xmath95 , comparable to that of a present - day massive galaxy .    in this section we have assumed that the sub - mm continuum emission is due to thermal emission from dust heated by young , hot stars .",
    "one curious property of 10   which may be relevant to this hypothesis is that the rest frame 60  emission predicted by the dust emission and the nonthermal radio emission at a rest wavelength of 6  cm ( extrapolated from the flux density observed at 1.4  ghz assuming a @xmath96 synchrotron spectrum ) does not follow the well - known 60  ",
    "6  cm correlation obeyed by local star forming galaxies ( , de jong 1985 ) .",
    "the rest frame 6  cm emission predicted by this correlation for 10   is @xmath97jy , more than an order of magnitude above the detected radio emission ( table  [ submmdata ] ) .",
    "the only ways of decreasing the predicted 60  emission would be to decrease the dust temperature and increase the dust optical depth , both of which result in worse fits to the sub - mm data .",
    "the existing _ iso _ data may be able to help constrain the dust temperature and optical depth estimates ( ivison 1999 ) .",
    "this issue can also be resolved with better far - infrared observations of 10 , which will soon be possible with the _ space infrared facility _ ( _ sirtf _ ) .",
    "if the large deviation from the 60   6  cm correlation is real , its interpretation is unclear .",
    "it is unlikely that this deviation is due to the sub - mm flux being heated by an agn instead of a starburst , since in the local universe agn tend to depart from the correlation by having excess nonthermal radio emission , not excess far - infrared emission ( , dey & van breugel 1994 ) .",
    "some local ulirgs ( , arp  220 ) do show low frequency turnovers in their radio spectra which are generally attributed to thermal absorption of the radio emission ( sopp & alexander 1991 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the first reliably identified sub - mm selected high redshift galaxy , smm  j02399@xmath610136 ( @xmath98 ; ivison 1998b ) , has a ` normal ' 60   6  cm ratio , yet shows some evidence for an agn contribution to the total emission . since the far - infrared flux densities are poorly constrained at present , and the origin of the correlation in local galaxies is also not completely understood , we hesitate to draw any firm conclusions from this observation .      measurements of the global star - formation history of the universe , using deep redshift surveys , e.g. , the canada france redshift survey ( lilly et al . 1996 ) reaching @xmath99 , the statistics of lyman - limit galaxies ( steidel & hamilton 1992 ) at @xmath100 , the hubble deep field ( hdf ) @xmath101 ( madau et al .",
    "1996 , connolly et al .",
    "1997 ) , imply that the star - formation and metal - production rates were about 10 times greater at @xmath99 than in the local universe , that they reach a maximum somewhere in the redshift range @xmath102 and remain roughly constant ( or perhaps slowly decline ) at higher redshifts ( steidel 1999 ) .    these conclusions , which are based almost entirely on samples selected at optical and near - uv wavelengths ,",
    "may be misleading ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; blain 1999a ) .",
    "absorption by dust in regions of star - formation may have distorted our picture of galaxy evolution in the high- and low - redshift universe in two ways .",
    "first , neglect of dust leads to an underestimate of the the star - formation rate in known high- and low - redshift objects .",
    "second , it is possible that an entire population of heavily dust - enshrouded high - redshift objects , such as eros , has escaped undetected in the optical / uv surveys .",
    "a useful diagnostic of the redness of the sed is the rest frame infrared  to  blue luminosity ratio ( @xmath103 ) , where @xmath104 at @xmath105 m and @xmath106 at @xmath107 . by this measure , the reddest galaxy in the ugc is arp  220 ( @xmath108 ; soifer  1984 ) .",
    "the mean @xmath103 value for the ultralumimous sample is 25 ( sanders 1987 ) , and the reddest ultraluminous galaxy in the _ iras bright galaxy catalog _ is iras  12112 + 0305 , which has @xmath109 .",
    "if we estimate @xmath110 for 10  by interpolating the observed @xmath35 and @xmath111 fluxes , we find that 10  has @xmath112jy .",
    "hence , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 ! the name ero is therefore justified for this remarkable object .    the relevance of 10  to cosmology and galaxy formation depends critically on the space density of the ero population , which is highly uncertain at present . under the assumptions that the eros form a homogeneous population and the redshift and sub - mm luminosity of 10is typical of this class",
    ", gd96 estimated that the space density of these objects is @xmath115 .",
    "hence , eros may be more abundant than the _ iras _ ultraluminous galaxies and quasars by two orders of magnitude . if the star formation rate for these galaxies is similar to that observed in 10  ( , @xmath116 ) , the star formation rate at @xmath117 associated with the ero population is @xmath118 .",
    "this sub - mm estimate of the star formation density exceeds the rest - frame uv estimates of the high  redshift star formation rate ( from the cfrs and hdf surveys ) by more than a factor of six .",
    "it is noteworthy that this crude estimate is roughly consistent with the predictions of pei & fall ( 1995 ) ( see also hughes 1998 ) .",
    "deep surveys at 850  of the sub - mm sky have resulted in the detection of several faint sources ( @xmath119  mjy ) , about 20% of which appear to have no obvious optical counterpart brighter than @xmath120 ( smail 1998 ) .",
    "it is possible that these ` missing ' optical identifications are galaxies similar to 10 , perhaps even fainter at optical wavelengths , but with similarly strong thermal dust emission at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "since the cumulative surface density of the sub - mm continuum emitters with 850  flux densities @xmath121  mjy is @xmath122 , the surface density of the optically faint fraction is @xmath123 ( estimates here are based on the surface density determined by blain 1999b ; however , see barger 1998 for a lower estimate ) .",
    "the surface density of eros is highly uncertain : hu & ridgway ( 1994 ) estimated that the surface density of objects with @xmath124 and @xmath125 is @xmath126 , whereas estimates of the surface density of less extreme eros ( with @xmath127 ) discovered serendipitously tend to be larger by at least an order of magnitude ( , dey , spinrad & dickinson 1995 ; knopp & chambers 1997 ; beckwith 1998 ) .",
    "the roughly comparable space densities of these two populations suggests that it is possible that eros comprise a significant fraction , perhaps all , of the optically faint sub - mm emitters discovered in recent surveys .",
    "a large fraction of both local ulirgs and distant scuba sources ( smail 1998 ) appear to be interacting or merging systems , perhaps similar to 10 .",
    "since the sub - mm sources thus far detected at flux densities @xmath128  mjy arguably account for upto 100% of the 850  cosmic sub - mm background ( smail 1997 , blain 1999 ) , the ero population may comprise a substantial component of the resolved emission .",
    "the relevance of the properties of 10  for our general understanding of both the ero and sub - mm populations will hinge on whether it represents a particularly high luminosity or low redshift member of this group .    the very red sed of 10  also implies that it will be extremely difficult to detect the most actively star - forming galaxies at higher redshifts , since they may be completely enshrouded by dust and undetectable at optical and near - ir wavelengths .",
    "for instance , if 10  were at @xmath129 , it would have a @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( = 50 , = 0.5 ) , and therefore undetectable in even the deepest existing ground- and space - based surveys .",
    "in contrast , the large negative sub - mm k - correction would imply that the 850  flux density of such an object would be @xmath132  mjy , comparable to that at @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of dusty star - forming systems at @xmath133 is not an unrealistic expectation : the @xmath134 galaxy 0140 + 326rd1 ( dey 1998 ) has been recently argued to be a dusty star  forming system based on its red @xmath135 color ( armus 1998 ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the inferred dust content of 0140 + 326rd1 is much lower than that of 10 : the implied extinction is @xmath136  mag for 0140 + 326rd1 , compared with @xmath137 for 10 .",
    "investigating the properties of the higher redshift counterparts of systems like 10  will require sensitive ground - based sub - mm facilities with high - angular resolution and space - based telescopes operating at near - ir and mid - ir wavelengths . in the near - future , the _ space infrared telescope facility _",
    "( _ sirtf _ ) will provide flux density observations of eros at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths ( @xmath138  ) allowing us to place more critical constraints on the dust masses , temperatures and source luminosities , and perhaps determine the relationship of these objects to present - day galaxies .",
    "we have presented new optical , near  ir and sub - mm observations of ero  j164502 + 4626.4 ( object # 10 in hu & ridgway 1994 ) , an extremely red object in the field of the qso pc  1643 + 4631a . the new optical and near  ir spectroscopy show that 10  is a distant galaxy lying at a redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "the peculiar rest frame near  uv and far  red morphologies suggest that 10  is a disturbed or interacting system .",
    "the far  ir and sub - mm evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that this ero is a dust - enshrouded object , with its luminosity ( @xmath139 ) powered by either a starburst or an agn .",
    "the existing spectral data for 10  show no strong evidence for agn emission at rest - frame near  uv or optical wavelengths .",
    "if the observed sub - mm continuum flux is due to optically thin thermal emission from dust heated by a young , star forming population , the inferred star formation rate is extremely large ( @xmath140 ) . in all its known properties , 10appears to be a high - redshift luminous counterpart of the dusty , ultraluminous galaxies discovered in the local universe by _",
    "iras_. although it is difficult to draw general conclusions from a single object , less luminous or higher redshift galaxies similar to 10  may be missed from even the deepest existing optical and surveys .",
    "it is important to determine the space densities of these eros and their relevance to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the distant universe .",
