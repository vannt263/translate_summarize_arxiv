    "at the center of the milky way lurks a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , whose presence and mass , @xmath34@xmath4 , has been ferreted out through its strong gravitational field ( e.g. , ghez et al . 2003a , b ; schdel et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) , but whose associated radiative emission has remained more elusive . for decades",
    "it was only detected at radio wavelengths ( see , e.g. , melia & falcke 2001 ) , where it appears to show low amplitude intensity variations with a quasi - periodicity of @xmath3 106 d ( zhao , bower , & goss 2001 ) .",
    "recent observations detected it at x - ray wavelengths , where it appears to be composed of the following two distinct components ( baganoff et al .",

    "2003 ; porquet et al .",
    "2003 ) : ( 1 ) a steady state , which has been stable to within @xmath310% over the past 4 years and which is spatially resolved with a size that corresponds to the bondi radius ( @xmath31@xmath5 ) , and ( 2 ) an unresolved variable component , which has a flux density that rises above the quiescent level by an order of magnitude for @xmath3 1 hour approximately once a day .",
    "these detections at opposite ends of the electromagnetic spectrum , along with existing infrared ( ir ) limits ( e.g. , serabyn et al .",
    "1997 ; morris et al .",
    "2001 ; hornstein et al .",
    "2002 ) reveal that overall , sgr a * is remarkably weak , with a bolometric luminosity of only 10@xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 or , equivalently , @xmath8 .",
    "detection of emission at ir wavelengths would be a very powerful constraint for the proposed models of the accretion flow onto the smbh as well as possible outflows ( e.g. , markoff et al .",
    "2001 ; liu & melia 2002 ; yuan et al .",
    "2003a ) . at mid - ir wavelengths ( @xmath98 @xmath0 m ) ,",
    "the detectability of a source is limited by thermal emission from dust ( stolovy et al . 1996 ; morris et al . 2001 ) . at near - ir wavelengths ( 1 - 2 @xmath0 m ) , detection of an associated point source",
    "is difficult due to the confusion with stellar sources ( e.g. , close et al .",

    "1997 ; hornstein et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the 3 - 5 @xmath0 m window ,",
    "the stellar and dust emission are both declining , potentially allowing an unambiguous detection of a radiative counterpart at a wavelength intermediate to the radio and x - ray regimes .    in this paper , we present new",

    "5 discusses possible emission mechanisms for the new source and concludes that it is indeed associated with the smbh .",
    "adaptive optics l ( @xmath10 = 3.8 @xmath0 m & @xmath11 = 0.7 @xmath0 m ) bandpass observations of the galactic center were obtained with the w. m. keck ii 10 m telescope using the facility near - infrared camera , nirc2 ( matthews et al .",

    "using an r=13.2 mag natural guide star located 30@xmath5 from sgr a * , we were able to achieve a resolution as high as 80 mas , which corresponds to the diffraction limit , and strehl ratios as high as @xmath30.4 .",
    "each night , several images , composed of 0.2 to 0.5 sec coadded exposures with effective exposure on the sky of 20 to 60 sec , were collected using a 5 position dither pattern with offsets of @xmath31 arcsec .",
    "the standard image reduction steps of sky subtraction , flat fielding , and bad pixel removal were carried out on each image . visual inspection of the reduced individual images eliminated those that were degraded by poor adaptive optics tip - tilt corrections , which occasionally generated double peaked psfs .",
    "inclusion in the final map for the remaining images was based on their estimated strehl ratios , which were required to be @xmath90.2 .",
    "all of the selected images were registered and averaged together using the centroid of irs 16c s light distribution .",
    "sources were identified and their positions and relative intensities were quantified using the point spread function ( psf ) fitting program starfinder ( diolaiti et al . 2000 ) .",
    "three bright point sources ( irs 16c , 16nw , & 33n ) were entered into starfinder s algorithm for generating a model psf .",
    "uncertainties in this process were established by dividing the data set up into independent maps composed of 2 to 3 frames , re - running this procedure on each map , and taking root - mean - square values for the astrometric and relative photometric values .",
    "this also allowed an examination of the data set for shorter timescale flux density variations .",
    "measurements reported here are photometrically calibrated based on absolute l photometry for several bright stars within our fied of view obtained by simons & becklin ( 1996 ) . from the 8 stars in common , we selected the following 4 stars , which are not known to be variable or spatially extended at l or at k ( 2.2 @xmath0 m ) , as calibration sources : irs 16ne ( 7.77 mag ) , irs 16sw - e ( 8.30 mag ) , irs 16nw ( 8.87 mag ) , & irs 16c ( also labeled irs 16c - w ; 8.91 mag ) .",
    "our multiple measurements of these sources reveal no evidence for variability , confirming their suitability as local standards .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the apparent magnitude calibration for each image to be 0.1 mag from the standard deviation of the mean of the calibration sources .",
    "all the reported measurements are based on a zero point of 248 jy for the l magnitude scale ( tokunaga 2000 ) .",
    "the inferred position of the smbh in the l maps is based on its dynamically determined position . using the orbital solutions for s0 - 1 , s0 - 2 ,",
    "s0 - 3 and s0 - 4 reported in ghez et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , we localize the smbh in each of the l images to within @xmath12 5 - 10 mas , where these uncertainties are limited by inaccuracies in the centroids of the stars in the l maps .",
    "figure  [ fig_lp ] shows a 12 @xmath13 12 region of the combined images centered on the smbh s location for each of the four nights reported here . in 2003",
    ", a new source is detected . with the exception of this new source all other detected l sources in figure  [ fig_lp ] are coincident with stars detected at 2.2 @xmath0 m ( ghez et al .",
    "the new source distinguishes itself in several ways .",
    "it is an unresolved point source that has a negligible average offset of 12 @xmath12 6 mas from the smbh .",
    "in contrast to stars in its vicinity , the new l source is remarkably variable .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig_phot ] , which plots the new source s dereddened flux density along with that of all sources that are nearby ( r @xmath14 05 ) , are comparably bright ( l @xmath15 13.6 mag ) , and do not suffer from confusion ; all the sources are dereddened assuming an l extinction of 1.83 mag , which is based on a visual extinction of 30 mag from rieke , rieke , & paul ( 1989 ) and an extinction law from moneti et al .",
    "on 2003 june 10 the new source was at its brightest at 12.28 mag and then it dimmed by a factor of 3 ( 13 @xmath1 ) to 13.38 mag by 2003 june 17 , with a factor of 2 ( 12 @xmath1 ) change occurring between june 16 and 17 .",
    "subdivision of the data into shorter time blocks of 60 second exposures , which correspond to elapsed time of 100 - 250 seconds depending on how images were selected ( see  3 ) , shows significant substructure ( see figure  [ fig_phot ] ) ; on 2003 june 17 the new source is observed to have dimmed by a factor of 2 , with a significance of 5 @xmath1 .",
    "this also increases the range of intensity variations observed over a week to a factor of 4 .",
    "table  [ tab_sum ] provides a summary of this source s measured properties , which includes its position with respect to the smbh as well as its apparent magnitude and dereddened flux density at 3.8 @xmath0 m .    in our 2002 map ,",
    "the new l source is blended with the star s0 - 2 , which at this time was experiencing its closest approach to the smbh with a projected separation of a mere 14 mas 2003a , b ) .",
    "this confused the identification of the l source in this first epoch map , as well as those obtained at the vlt on 2002 august 29 ( clnet et al .",
    "2003 , genzel et al .",
    "2003 ) = l@xmath16 + 0.82 mag & l@xmath17 = l@xmath18 + 0.37 mag .",
    "this is primarily a consequence of a different choice of calibration sources , which includes known variable and extended stars in their sample ( see  3 ) ; clnet et al .",
    "( 2003 ) use irs 16c , 29n , 16cc , 21 , 33se , & mpe+1.6 - 6.8 and genzel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) restrict their analysis of the same data set to irs 16cc & 33n . ] in our 2003 maps , s0 - 2 is 87 mas away from the dynamical center and is clearly separated from the newly identified l source ( see figure  [ fig_lp ] ) . since s0 - 2 shows no evidence for significant variability in the k - band , where there is negligible confusion with other sources ( ghez et al .",
    "2003b ) , we use the l mag of s0 - 2 measured in 2003 june 16 & 17 , when the contrast between s0 - 2 and the new source is smallest , ( @xmath14l@xmath19 = 13.07 ) to subtract the s0 - 2 contamination from the new source in 2002 may 31 .",
    "this results in an inferred brightness of l=13.2 mag , which is close to the average of the values measured in 2003 june .",
    "a comparison of the 2002 position with the average 2003 position limits its proper motion to 400 @xmath12 300 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the newly identified l source has several properties that indicate that it is affiliated with the smbh .",
    "first , its location on the plane of the sky is coincident with the smbh to within 18 mas ( 1 @xmath1 ) .",
    "second , it appears to be a stationary source with an upper limit on its transverse motion of 700 km s@xmath7 , which differs from the proper motions of @xmath206,000 km s@xmath7 for other sources that have come within 10 mas of the dynamical center ( ghez et al .",
    "2003b ; schdel et al .",
    "third , it is a variable source with significant flux density changes observed on timescales as short as 40 min .",
    "fourth , it is an extremely red object . in the k - band ,",
    "a stationary source consistent with the location of the dynamical center would have to be fainter than at least k @xmath3 15.5 mag to be consistent with the observations of ghez et al .",
    "( 2003b ) and hornstein et al .",
    "the k - l color of the new source must therefore be greater than 2.1 mag , which is at least 1.0 mag redder than all the nearby stars used as comparison stars in figure  [ fig_phot ] .",
    "such a red color is expected for sgr a * from the sub - mm detections ( e.g. , falcke et al .",
    "1998 ; zhao et al .",
    "2003 ) and 2.2 @xmath21 limits ( hornstein et al . 2002 ) shown in figure 3 .",
    "we conclude that the new l source is associated with the smbh or , equivalently , sgr a * , and therefore refer to it as sgra*-ir .",
    "several mechanisms associated with a smbh can give rise to infrared variability , including gravitational lensing ( e.g. , alexander & loeb 2001 ) , disk illumination ( cuadra , nayakshin , & sunyaev 2003 ) , star - disk collisions ( nayakshin & sunyaev 2003 ) , and physical processes in the smbh s accretion flow ( e.g. , markoff et al .",
    "2001 ; liu & melia 2002 ; yuan , quataert , & narayan 2003a , b ) . assuming that we are witnessing a single phenomenon , the observed short timescales for the variations , @xmath340 min , rule out the first two possibilities and the longer timescales eliminate the third .",
    "we therefore suggest that the detected 3.8 @xmath0 m emission emanates from either an accretion flow or an outflow quite close to the smbh , within 5 au , or equivalently 80 r@xmath2 . while the shortest timescale variations observed at 3.8 @xmath0 m are comparable to the x - ray flare timescales ( baganoff et al .",
    "2001 , 2003b ; goldwurm et al . 2003 ; porquet et al .",
    "2003 ) , the probability that such an x - ray flare occurred during any of these observations is less than 0.05 and the probability that such x - ray flares occurred or were in progress during all of our observations is less than 10@xmath22 . nonetheless , the similarity in the timescales for variation at 3.8 @xmath0 m and at x - ray wavelengths lead us to suggest that the variable 3.8 @xmath0 m emission is produced by a mechanism related to that which produces the x - ray flares .",
    "we presume any associated variable x - ray emission during our observations was below the quiescent level .",
    "several models of the flared x - ray emission have been proposed , invoking physical processes such as elevated accretion rates or enhanced electron acceleration from mhd turbulence , reconnection , or weak shocks and emission mechanisms including bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , and inverse compton ( markoff et al . 2001 ; liu & melia 2001 , 2002 ; yuan et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "models that account for the low variability amplitude at radio frequencies generally invoke acceleration of some fraction of the electrons into the power - law tail of the electron energy distribution . in these models ,",
    "the x - ray flares arise from either synchrotron emission , if a small fraction of the electrons are energetic enough ( @xmath23 ) , or by synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) upscattering of sub - mm and infrared photons , for a larger but less dramatically accelerated population of electrons . in both cases ,",
    "a significant amount of 3.8 @xmath0 m emission can be produced from the direct synchrotron emission of the accelerated population of electrons ( see figure  [ fig_sed ] ) and the variability may be induced by small changes in the fraction of electrons in the high - energy power - law tail of the electron energy distribution or by changes in the value of the power - law ( yuan et al .",
    "for the two cases that produce 3.8 @xmath0 m emission via synchrotron emission , the ssc model predicts correlated ir and x - ray flares , while the synchrotron only model can more readily allow for an ir only flare , depending on the spectrum of the accelerated electron energy distribution .",
    "it therefore appears at present that the synchrotron only model best fits the available data ( e.g. , yuan et al . 2003b ) .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the x - ray flares , which suggest that processes giving rise to a high - energy power - law tail in the electron energy distribution occur infrequently ( @xmath92% of the time ) , the persistently detected variable 3.8 @xmath0 m emission suggests that such processes are in effect much more often .",
    "more generally , the 3.8 @xmath0 m emission opens up a continuously accessible window for studying the conditions and physical processes within the plasma that is either accreting onto or outflowing from the central black hole .",
