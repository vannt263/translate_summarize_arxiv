    "we do not attempt to correct the clump mass estimates for free - free contributions to the 1.1 mm flux density for several reasons : ( 1 ) many bgps sources are large , and either encompass area outside the vla 1.3 cm primary beam and/or extended cm sources for which flux densities can not be measured from our data",
    ". hence we can not correct for free - free contributions in a uniform way for all sources in our sample .",
    "( 2 ) the uncertainties in the clump mass estimates are dominated by the uncertainty in the correction factor for bgps catalog fluxes ( @xmath4815% ) and in the assumed dust temperature . for the sources in our sample with the strongest free - free emission , g28.28@xmath160.36 and g49.27@xmath160.34 , the total contribution of all cm sources within the vla 1.3 cm primary beam corresponds to changes in the mass estimates of @xmath27% and @xmath251% , respectively , assuming the steepest spectral indices allowed by our data ( @xmath46m / m @xmath2130/1840 m@xmath8 and @xmath245/5050 m@xmath8 for t@xmath71=16 k , within the uncertainties quoted in table  [ detect_table ] ) .",
    "figure  [ mass_histo]a shows histograms of masses estimated using t@xmath71=16 k and the integrated flux density from the bgps catalog for egos with / without cm-@xmath5 counterparts . for comparison , figure  [ mass_histo]b shows masses estimated using the 80@xmath22 aperture fluxes from the bgps catalog .",
    "this provides a comparison of the mass at a uniform angular scale across our ego sample , though the apertures are centered on the 1.1 mm peaks , and may be offset from the ego positions .",
    "no trend in clump masses for egos with / without cm-@xmath5 counterparts is seen in figure  [ mass_histo]a or b. adopting t@xmath71=28 k for all sources does not change the relative positions of cm detections / nondetections , only shifts the absolute mass scale .",
    "if we instead assume that sources with cm-@xmath5 continuum detections are warmer , the mass range of clumps associated with ego cm detections and nondetections still largely overlaps ( fig .  [ mass_histo]c , d ) .    for bgps clumps associated with hii regions , @xcite found a correlation between the clump mass and that of the ionizing stars .",
    "this indicates a relationship between the mass of a clump , and the mass of the massive stars that it forms .",
    "this idea , combined with the importance of accretion from large - scale reservoirs to massive star formation , suggests that the egos in our survey sample have the potential to continue accreting , and eventually become massive stars that will ionize their surroundings ( i.e.  form uc hii regions ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ mass_histo ] , there is no apparent trend in clump masses for egos with cm-@xmath5 detections as compared to cm-@xmath5 nondetections , as might be expected if the presence / absence of cm continuum emission was related to reservoir  and so to final stellar  mass . in this picture , the paucity of cm-@xmath5 continuum detections towards egos is a measure of their youth .",
    "additional support for this explanation is derived from the sed fitting of g19.01@xmath160.03 , a cm nondetection .",
    "this myso is actively driving a bipolar outflow , traced by class i ch@xmath1oh masers , sio emission , and high - velocity , collimated @xmath44co and hco@xmath45 lobes .",
    "an active outflow implies active accretion , which is expected to alter the properties of the central ( proto)star , affecting its output of ionizing radiation .",
    "based on the sed modeling , the central ( proto)star of g19.01@xmath160.03 has a luminosity of @xmath210@xmath11 l@xmath8 , mass of @xmath15 10 m@xmath8 , and is accreting at a rate of @xmath210@xmath72 m@xmath8 yr@xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ g19_rad_temp_plot]a shows the stellar radius and temperature for the best - fit models ( @xmath73 per datapoint @xmath253 ) to the sed composed of the irac , mips , and sma data from .",
    "both swollen , very low temperature ( @xmath25000 k ) and hotter ( @xmath2310@xmath11 k ) models are allowed ; however , even the highest stellar temperature in figure  [ g19_rad_temp_plot]a falls below the 30,000 k threshold for `` significant '' lyman continuum output suggested by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ g19_rad_temp_plot]b shows that if the low angular resolution ( single dish ) ( sub)mm flux density estimates at 870 @xmath0 m and 1.1 mm @xcite are substituted for the sma data , all the well - fit models are pushed to large radii and low temperatures ..    @xcite report the detection of spatially extended , optically thin free - free emission in the fields of six 6.7 ghz ch@xmath1oh masers previously reported as 3.6 cm continuum nondetections @xcite , and caution that the evolutionary state of ch@xmath1oh maser sources may be misconstrued if extended free - free emission is missed in high - resolution interferometric observations .",
    "we believe that our cm continuum study of egos is robust against such misclassification for several reasons .",
    "( 1 ) the sensitivity and imaging fidelity of our vla observations are better than the atca survey of @xcite ; though we can not recover fluxes for sources more extended than @xmath210@xmath22 , our data are sensitive to structures up to @xmath220@xmath22 in angular scale (  [ vlaobs ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated by our 3.6 cm detection of the hii region f g28.83 - 0.25-cm1 , which was missed by @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) we have examined glimpse and mipsgal 24 @xmath0 m images for the @xcite targets , and the extended hii regions reported manifest themselves as structured , multiband irac sources and/or 8 @xmath0 m nebulae associated with bright 24 @xmath0 m emission ( see also discussion of  diffuse red clumps  by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is consistent with the mir morphologies of our `` field '' cm sources ( fig .",
    "[ 3color_big ] ) , including those overresolved in our observations ( and so candidates for being possibly `` extended and overlooked '' ) .",
    "( 3 ) in several cases , the extended hii regions reported by @xcite are offset from the ch@xmath1oh maser positions , and the masers are more closely associated with hc hii regions or with 3 mm emission attributed to dust .",
    "so , as @xcite note , the presence of more evolved hii regions in the vicinity of 6.7 ghz ch@xmath1oh masers may simply be due to the clustered nature of massive star formation .",
    "in fact , we see several potential examples of this in our data . in these cases , the high - resolution glimpse and mipsgal mir images are helpful in identifying evolved sources and assessing their likely relation to ( less evolved ) sources of interest (  [ individ_sources ] ) .",
    "our exceptionally deep vla 3.6 cm survey ( median rms",
    "@xmath230 @xmath0jy  beam@xmath3 ) provides convincing evidence that most egos are young mysos , prior to the development of a uc hii region .",
    "no continuum emission is detected at 3.6 or 1.3 cm ( median rms @xmath20.25 mjy  beam@xmath3 ) towards the majority ( 8/14 @xmath257% ) of egos in our survey sample .",
    "only two sources ( 2/14 @xmath214% ) are associated with optically thin cm-@xmath5 emission from uc / c hii regions ( one of which is the only one of our targets without an associated 6.7 ghz ch@xmath1oh maser ) .",
    "each of these egos exhibits cm-@xmath5 multiplicity , with morphological evidence that a less - evolved cm continuum source may be the driving source of the outflow traced by 4.5 @xmath0 m and class i ch@xmath1oh maser emission . with the exception of the uc hii regions , most of the cm-@xmath5 ego counterparts are weak ( @xmath6 1 mjy ) , unresolved at the @xmath21@xmath22 resolution of our survey , undetected at 1.3 cm , and characterized by intermediate spectral indices consistent with either hc hii regions or ionized winds or jets .",
    "three of these weak , unresolved 3.6 cm sources are coincident with 6.7 ghz ch@xmath1oh maser emission , indicative of ionized gas very near the central ( proto)star . likely to be an optically thick hc hii region , one ego cm counterpart is detected only at 1.3 cm and is associated with a hot core and h@xmath7o and 6.7 ghz ch@xmath1oh maser emission .",
    "the predominance of very weak cm-@xmath5 continuum detections in our survey indicates the promise of the greatly enhanced continuum sensitivity of the expanded very large array ( evla ) for understanding the early stages of massive star formation , including the earliest appearance of ionized gas around accreting mysos .    in sum ,",
    "the cm wavelength properties of egos are indicative of an early stage of massive star formation , when photoionizing feedback from the central myso is not yet a significant influence on the ( proto)cluster environment .",
    "the presence of 4.5 @xmath0 m emission , class i ch@xmath1oh masers , and sio emission indicates that these egos are actively driving outflows , and so ( presumably ) actively accreting .",
    "notably , two of the egos with weak or no cm emission in our survey ( g11.92@xmath160.61 and g19.01@xmath160.03 ) have collimated , high - velocity molecular outflows , in contrast to some recent theoretical predictions that ionizing radiation will dominate outflow dynamics in massive star - forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . already sufficiently massive to excite 6.7 ghz ch@xmath1oh maser emission ,",
    "the surveyed egos are associated with significant clump - scale gas reservoirs .",
    "these clumps can provide sufficient material for sustained , rapid accretion as the egos continue to grow from mysos into massive stars .",
