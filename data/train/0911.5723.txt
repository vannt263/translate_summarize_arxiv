    "it is generally observed that microscopic impurity particle interacting with bose liquid / gas behaves as a free particle with effective mass increased by its interaction with bose fluid .",
    "such dissipationless quantum motion is observed both for translational motion of particles in bec and for rotations of molecules in superfluid helium .",
    "a question that received attention of theorists has been the structure of the ground state of impurity in bec , in particular , the possibility of the so called self - localization of an impurity : the appearance of a bound state of an impurity with bec despite the purely repulsive interaction potential .",
    "such behavior has been investigated by a number of authors using linearized gross - pitaevskii equations @xcite .",
    "this method allows to obtain the non - linear imaginary time schrdinger equation for the impurity particle .",
    "the energy of the particle becomes negative above certain value of coupling strength that depends on the bec / particle and bec / bec interaction potentials .",
    "extension of these results within fully quantum treatment is an open question and is the main subject of present work .    in this paper",
    "the matrix element of the reduced density operator of impurity is calculated which allows to compute the energy and the space correlation function of impurity .",

    "this method was successfully applied to the problems described by the frhlich - type hamiltonians such as polarons , electron - plasmon interaction @xcite , nucleon - meson interaction @xcite , many body fermion problems @xcite , and many others . since the hamiltonian of our model ( one particle interacting with uncoupled bosonic modes ) is of the frhlich type",

    "we obtain the free energy of an impurity as a function of coupling constant .",

    "represents the first order correction to the energy due to the particle - bec interaction . in the interaction part of the hamiltonian as well as in the hamiltonian of the free bec we neglected the terms responsible for the interaction between the bogoliubov s excitations",
    "this approximation remains valid if the single impurity alters the surrounding bec only slightly which is always the case in the macroscopic limit .    in order to describe the statistical properties of the impurity that stays in thermal equilibrium with the bec environment",
