    "studies of the in plane low temperature penetration depth of single crystals of twinned and untwinned yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 ( ybco@xmath7 ) at optimum doping ( @xmath8 ) have revealed a linear temperature dependence.@xcite this has been confirmed in more recent measurements on single crystals by mao et al.@xcite and on thin films by de vaulchier et al.@xcite although reports of other power laws persist.@xcite extensions to underdoped samples ( ybco@xmath9 ) as well as to the overdoped case ybco@xmath10 confirm that this linear law does not depend on oxygen doping although the value of its slope is affected . in untwinned single crystals , it has also been found that the zero temperature value of the in - plane penetration depth is highly anisotropic : @xmath11 while @xmath12where @xmath13 denotes the chain direction , and the sample doping is near optimal ( @xmath14 with @xmath15 k ) .",
    "this large anisotropy in @xmath16 is , however , not reflected strongly in the temperature dependence of the normalized penetration depth @xmath17 which is found to be nearly the same for @xmath18 and @xmath13,@xcite with that along the chain showing a slightly steeper slope .",
    "a linear temperature behaviour is , of course , what is expected for a superconductor with a gap which has @xmath4-wave symmetry with zeros crossing the fermi surface .",
    "also , the addition of zn impurities,@xcite which are believed to act as unitary scatters , is found to alter the temperature dependence of @xmath19 from linear to @xmath20 , which is expected for @xmath4-wave .",
    "there are now many other experiments that confirm the @xmath4-wave symmetry of the gap .",
    "examples are angular resolved photoemission@xcite ( arpes ) as well as squid @xcite experiments .",
    "these latter experiments have been devised specifically to measure the phase of the gap rather than simply probe for zeros crossing the fermi surface as does arpes and penetration depth .",
    "detailed theoretical studies of the @xmath21-@xmath13 plane anisotropy have been carried out by the present authors @xcite in a two plane model , coupled through a transverse tunnelling matrix element ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the general conclusion of these studies is that there is a significant amount of condensate on the chains and that the gap on the cuo chains must be of the same order of magnitude as on the cuo@xmath5 planes .",
    "the condensate on the chains is , of course , the ultimate source of the orthorhombicity which is reflected in the observed large in plane anisotropy for @xmath22 and @xmath23 at t=0 .",
    "the recent theoretical work of odonovan and carbotte@xcite and of xiang and wheatley@xcite further confirm these general conclusions .",
    "cits @xcite experiments in which the gap is measured separately on the chains and on the plane give added evidence that both gap values are of roughly of the same size .",
    "an anisotropy of similar magnitude is also seen in the dc resistivity @xcite and optical conductivity@xcite .",
    "recently , hardy et al.,@xcite in addition to summarizing their result for @xmath21-@xmath13 plane anisotropy in the underdoped , optimally doped and overdoped cases , have also presented @xmath0-axis data.@xcite for ybco@xmath9 ( @xmath24 k ) , they estimate @xmath25 . for ybco@xmath26 ( @xmath15 k )",
    "@xmath27 which is about the same as for the overdoped case with x=6.99 ( t = 89k ) .",
    "they give detailed results for the temperature variation of the ratio @xmath28 and find , in all cases , that at low @xmath29 , the curve for the @xmath0-axis falls well above the linear dependence found for @xmath22 and @xmath23 and may vary as a higher than linear power .",
    "a striking fact is that the underdoped and overdoped case are found to have nearly the same dependence on reduced temperature @xmath30 while the optimally doped case falls slightly below .",
    "a possible explanation for the rather flat behaviour observed in the underdoped case is that it is representative of incoherent coupling between the chains and planes .",
    "this view is consistent with decreasing coupling between planar elements as oxygen is removed from the sample .    for fully oxygenated ybco@xmath7",
    ", the experimental results on the @xmath0-axis dc resistivity now appear to converge .",
    "it is found that @xmath31 is metallic in the @xmath0-direction and has a nearly linear temperature dependence.@xcite further , the anisotropy ratio @xmath32 is of order 30 - 70 which is consistent with the value of @xmath33 quoted above if we assume that an effective mass model is qualitatively valid . on the other hand , when the sample is deoxygenated , the @xmath0-axis behaviour can change radically with the dc resistivity @xmath34 showing a semiconducting - like behaviour at low temperature ( @xmath35 ) .    also , the ratio @xmath32 is much bigger@xcite in the underdoped samples than for optimal doping .",
    "for example , at @xmath36 k , @xmath32 @xcite is of order @xmath37 .",
    "this large value is in accordance with the value found for the corresponding ratio of @xmath38 .",
    "it is to be noted that as the temperature is increased , metallic behaviour is recovered even for ybco@xmath9 .",
    "the very large value of @xmath39 observed in the underdoped case and its semiconducting behaviour has been taken as evidence that the @xmath0-axis transport can not be described by conventional three dimensional coherent bloch transport and that it is dominated by a different ( incoherent ) mechanism due to the highly two dimensional nature of the electronic states .",
    "evidence for this is provided by estimates of the @xmath0-axis mean free path which find that it is of the order or less than the @xmath0-axis spacing .",
    "various possible mechanisms@xcite for @xmath0-axis transport have been reviewed by zha , cooper and pines.@xcite in particular , rojo and levin @xcite have considered explicitly static and dynamic off diagonal disorders as well as the effect of the interplane matrix element @xmath2 and also include several limiting cases . in particular , ordinary transport and the pure incoherent case with @xmath40 and static impurity scattering are treated .",
    "this latter case has been discussed in detail in the work of graf , rainer and sauls.@xcite it leads to a @xmath0-axis resistivity that is inversely related to its in - plane value .",
    "the source of incoherent scattering in such models is , however , not clear .",
    "another interesting idea is the dynamic thermal dephasing process suggested by leggett @xcite in which in - plane thermal fluctuations can be larger than @xmath2 and so destroy coherent @xmath0-axis transport .",
    "this mechanism , however , can not explain the observation that metallic transport is restored at high temperature for the underdoped samples . a further model based on resonant tunneling through a barrier layer which due to abrikosov,@xcite models the @xmath0-axis d.c .",
    "resistivity with some succes .",
    "yet another approach assumes that the copper oxide planes can not be described by fermi liquid theory and spin and charge degrees of freedom are separated.@xcite no consensus has yet emerged about @xmath0-axis coupling .    in this paper",
    ", we will be mainly interested in the @xmath0-axis penetration depth . in this case ,",
    "radtke , kostur and levin @xcite have already given results for the @xmath41 value and temperature dependence of @xmath42 in a model which contains three distinct contributions dependent on @xmath2 , a pure incoherent impurity assisted contribution as in the work of graf et al.@xcite and a phonon assisted interlayer inelastic part .",
    "they find that when the direct contribution dominates , @xmath1 and @xmath19 will have the same linear temperature dependence at low @xmath29 while for impurity assisted hopping @xmath43 will show a much flatter , more @xmath44-wave low temperature behaviour as is observed in experiments .",
    "there are two problems with this scenario as applied to underdoped ybco .",
    "first , while @xmath2 may be small , the coherent part may not be negligible .",
    "estimates of @xmath2 provided by zha et al.@xcite give @xmath45 mev for ybco@xmath46 .",
    "this value is reduced by an order of magnitude from @xmath4730 - 40 mev estimated in optimally doped ybco but is still significant and is certainly much larger than the value of 0.1 mev estimated for bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cacu@xmath5o@xmath48 .",
    "secondly , the impurity assisted contribution vanishes by symmetry for a @xmath4-wave superconductor if the impurity potential is isotropic in momentum space , i.e. a @xmath49-function in direct space .",
    "this may not be a serious obstacle , particularly in ybco which is orthorhombic and so can not have a purely @xmath4-wave order parameter .",
    "a more serious problem is the microscopic origin of this impurity scattering .",
    "this is particularly problematic since many experiments would lead us to believe that these crystals are in the clean limit as far as @xmath50 plane properties are concerned .    in this paper",
    ", we study a different mechanism for the @xmath0-axis penetration depth .",
    "we consider the possibility that it is a manifestation of the interband transitions which become more important in the @xmath0-axis conductivity as @xmath2 is reduced in magnitude . in previous work on the normal state a.c .",
    "conductivity,@xcite we found that the usual drude - like intraband contribution is of order @xmath51 and the interband contribution goes like @xmath52 for the in - plane conductivity . on the other hand , for the @xmath0-axis conductivity",
    ", the intraband contribution goes like @xmath53 while the interband remains of order @xmath52 .",
    "it is clear then that , for sufficiently small values of @xmath2 , the interband contribution to the penetration depth will dominate , and @xmath42 may be significantly different from @xmath19 .",
    "it is precisely for this case that we found a pseudo gap in the normal state @xmath0 axis conductivity .",
    "thus the apperence of a pseudogap and a flat low temperature dependence in the c - axis penetration depth are connected in our theory .    in section [ two ] , we present the necessary formalism .",
    "numerical results are given and discussed in section [ three ] . a brief conclusion is included in section [ four ] .",
    "to remain simple , we consider two isolated planes coupled with a transverse matrix element @xmath2 .",
    "the uncoupled planes have dispersion @xmath54-\\mu_1 , \\label{1}\\ ] ] representing the tetragonal cuo@xmath5 plane and @xmath55 representing the orthorhombic cuo chains . in ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the band widths , @xmath58 is a next nearest neighbour hopping amplitude in units @xmath59 , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are chemical potentials related to the fillings on the chains and planes .",
    "this model is already quite complicated to deal with and final results are obtained only numerically .",
    "nevertheless , it needs to be recognized that it is still oversimplified and may not apply directly to ybco .",
    "for instance , in ybco , there are three planes per unit cell : a bilayer of cuo@xmath5 planes and a layer of cuo chains in between them .",
    "these 3 planes form the basic unit cell which is then coupled to the other unit cells through additional , presumably insulating , layers . under such circumstances , estimates of the transverse coupling @xmath2 provided from dc resistivity data may well reflect the value of the intercell coupling ( which could be incoherent ) rather than the plane - chain coupling within the cell ( which could be coherent ) . treating such complications is , however , beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    ", we will assume only 2 planes but take one to be chains so as to introduce the observed orthorhombicity .",
    "the transverse coupling @xmath2 therefore represents both the chain - plane coupling and the intercell coupling .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian for our model is @xmath62 where @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 creates an electron of spin @xmath65 and momentum @xmath66 in the plane ( @xmath67 ) or chain ( @xmath68 ) layers .",

    "the unit cell size is @xmath4 along the @xmath0-axis .",
    "the superconducting gap @xmath71 is chosen to be the same in both the plane and chain layers .",
    "we will not determine @xmath71 through solution of a gap equation but will instead be guided by experiments which have indicated that the gap on the planes and chains are very similar . for our simple model",
    "we have a single @xmath4-wave gap characteristic of the entire system .",
    "we make no attempt to relate this gap to the basic microscopic interactions but simply postulate its existence .    in a previous paper",

    "it is to be noted that the second term in ( [ 25 ] ) , which is new and which gives the interband transitions , will also give no contribution to @xmath129 when @xmath40 as it must .",

    "this competition between these two terms leads to a much flatter temperature dependence for @xmath135 than does the more common intraband term ( [ 26 ] ) . choosing the @xmath136 direction",
    ", we note that the intraband part ( [ 26 ] ) goes like @xmath137 because @xmath138 in ( [ 22c ] ) goes like @xmath52 while the interband contribution ( [ 27 ] ) goes only like @xmath52 . for sufficiently small values of @xmath2 ,",
    "it is clear that the interband contribution will dominate the @xmath0-axis penetration depth and that our intuition based only on the intraband band term will no longer hold .",
    "our numerical work , to be described below , will tell us the value of @xmath2 where this new regime of behaviour is reached . before presenting results",
    "it is interesting to note that the in - plane situation is quite different with regards to the dominance , or lack there of , of the interband processes .",
    "this can be seen from equation ( [ 26 ] ) and the realization that , for the x or y directions , the intraband contribution is , to leading order , independent of @xmath2 , while from ( [ 27 ] ) , we see that the interband part is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "thus , for small @xmath2 , the interband contribution to the in - plane penetration depth will not be important compared with the intraband contribution and the familiar behaviour will result . on the other hand , when @xmath2 gets large , the interband contribution to the in - plane penetration depth can become of some importance .",

    "[ f1 ] , we show our model band structure . we have taken @xmath139 mev with @xmath140 . the dashed line gives the plane and chain fermi surface contour in the 2-dimensional cuo@xmath5 plane brillouin zone as a function of momentum components @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",

    "this value is chosen to agree with experiments on ybco which find a rather large value for the gap to critical temperature ratio .",
    "this is also necessary in order to get an in - plane temperature dependence for the penetration depth which is in reasonable accord with experiment . before describing our results and commenting on them",
    ", we stress that in ybco@xmath7 as a function of oxygen doping , the fermi surface of the chains will certainly be changed in important ways because oxygen depletion occurs on the chains as we go from the overdoped case @xmath154 to the underdoped case with @xmath155 . at the same time , the number of holes on the planes as well as on the chains will change so the value of the chemical potential and displacement between bands , @xmath60 and @xmath61 will change as will the filling factor in each band .",
    "such details are not yet known and in the absence of such information , we have chosen to keep the bands fixed as well as the filling which was not chosen to specifically model the overdoped or underdoped case . here , we are primarily interested in understanding the effect of interband transitions on the penetration depth and their variation with chain - plane coupling @xmath2 which may change significantly with doping although again this is not well known .    in figs .",

    "is reduced in size , we see that the in plane behaviour is not strongly affected but the @xmath0-axis is .",

    "this different behaviour results when the interband terms ( [ 27 ] ) start becoming dominant over the more conventional intraband term ( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "we might expect this to occur in the underdoped situation in ybco where @xmath2 is expected to be of order 5 mev or so . for optimally",
    "doped ybco , interband terms contribute less to the @xmath0-axis behaviour and the system becomes more three dimensional .",
    "0.9    in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , we show the absolute value of the inverse square of the zero temperature penetration depth @xmath159 for the three directions .",
    "note the difference in scale between @xmath158 and @xmath160 . in the plot of @xmath161",
    ", we can see very clearly the @xmath52 dependence discussed earlier .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath157 is smaller than @xmath162 , roughly by a factor of two because of the additional screening current carried by the chains .",
    "the difference is reduced as @xmath2 increases .",
    "this is attributed to the increase significance of the interband contribution to the @xmath13-direction penetration depth as @xmath2 is increased . in the x direction , the intraband term in ( [ 26 ] ) goes like @xmath163\\ ] ] for most of the brillouin zone and the second term is small as is the interband term ( [ 27 ] ) which also varies as @xmath164 . in the region where the plane and chain fermi surface crosses this argument",
    "does not apply , but @xmath165 is small there and so we can conclude that the terms in @xmath2 are not important .",
    "this does not hold , however , for the y - direction because in that case @xmath166 and @xmath167 are not necessarily small in regions of the brillouin zone where the corrections in @xmath2 are significant and we expect some contribution to @xmath168 .",
    "we have considered a model of two conducting planes per unit cell , one with tetragonal symmetry representing a cuo@xmath5 plane , the other with orthorhombic symmetry , representing a cuo chain .",
    "a transverse hopping matrix element @xmath2 is included which couples the two bands coherently and introduces the third dimension .",
    "for such a model , new transitions enter the electromagnetic properties that would not be present in the case of one atom per unit cell .",
    "in addition to the usual intraband terms , there are terms which now correspond to interband transitions .",
    "we have investigated the effect of these terms on the value of the zero temperature penetration depth and on its temperature dependence .",
    "it is found that for the @xmath21-direction , the effects of @xmath2 are small while for the @xmath13-direction , along the chains , there can be significant corrections to the intraband terms , although to leading order @xmath23 is still independent of @xmath2 . in this case , the corrections for the interband terms go like @xmath52 .    for the @xmath0-direction ( perpendicular to the planes ) ,",
    "the situation is quite different .",
    "the conventional intraband terms go like @xmath53 while the interband ones go like @xmath52 so , for sufficiently small values of @xmath2 , the interband contribution eventually must take over .",
    "we find that these have a new temperature dependence quite distinct from the linear law expected for a @xmath4-wave superconductor at low temperature .",
    "they give a much flatter curve at low temperature for the @xmath0-axis superfluid density .",
    "numerical calculations indicate that the interband term will be important when @xmath2 is of order 5 - 10 mev .",
    "this value is reasonable for underdoped ybco . in our previous work on the normal state",
    ", we found that a pseudogap develops in the @xmath0 axis optical conductivity for such small values of @xmath2 .",
    "this offers an alternate interpretation of the @xmath0-axis data in the underdoped case , which does not rely on any incoherent elastic scattering or @xmath0-axis out - of - plane phonon assisted process .",
    "our calculations naturally give a linear dependence in @xmath21- and @xmath13- directions and a much flatter dependence for the @xmath0-axis as is observed . on the other hand , as the coupling between the two planes is increased , the system becomes much more 3 dimensional and the temperature dependence of all three penetration depths become similar and are linear at low t for a @xmath4-wave gap .",
    "these findings are all in general qualitative agreement with the data in ybco .",
    "as discussed in the text , however , our results can probably not be applied to the oxides without modifications because our electronic structure model is too simple .",
    "for example , the unit cell in ybco contains a cuo@xmath5 bilayer as well as cuo chains .",
    "the coupling between planes within a cell is likely to be quite different from that between two cells while in our simplified model a single @xmath2 enters .",
    "still , the model allows us to introduce and understand better the role that interband transitions can play in the @xmath0-axis penetration depth .",
    "it exhibits many of the qualitative properties observed in ybco .",
