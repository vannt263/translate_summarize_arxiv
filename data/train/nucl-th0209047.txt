    "the strong and electromagnetic decays of the scalar mesons @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) are recently object of large theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "the structure of these mesons is not yet fully understood and the coupling constants of their decays not determined ( see @xcite and refs . herein ) . as an example , the electromagnetic constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 are very important for the solution of different problems in in hadron electrodynamics . in the near threshold region , the constant @xmath10 drives the @xmath12-contribution to the differential cross section of the process @xmath13 @xcite . the coupling constant @xmath11 is important for the estimation of the effects of the meson exchange currents for the deuteron electromagnetic form factors @xcite , particularly in the region of large momentum transfer .",
    "both these constants play a major role in the interpretation @xcite of the hermes effect @xcite , concerning the anomalous behavior of the electroproduction cross section on nuclei at low @xmath14 - where the cross section is enhanced for longitudinally polarized virtual photons and depleted for transversally polarized photons .",
    "moreover , the constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 enter in the interpretation of different radiative decays of vector mesons , like @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "two - photon decays of scalar mesons , @xmath17 , which are important for the estimation of the corresponding @xmath2channel contributions to the amplitudes of real and virtual compton scattering on nucleons @xcite , could be estimated on the basis of the @xmath18 coupling constants , in the vdm approach .    in the framework of the effective lagrangian approach",
    ", the calculation of the cross section for scalar meson photo- and electro - production on nucleons requires the knowledge of the @xmath18 and @xmath19-coupling constants .",
    "the strong coupling constants @xmath19 @xcite enter in various calculations in hadron dynamics , not only with respect to the nn - potential , but also for different observables for processes like @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of the experimental study of scalar meson production depends essentially on the nature and on the rate of the decay .",
    "if , for example , the decay @xmath23 or @xmath24 dominate , these mesons could be observed in the @xmath25 effective mass distribution , close to the kaon mass , as a resonant contribution .",
    "such effects have been observed in @xmath26-collisions @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the data needs an adequate theoretical approach for the process @xmath27 .",
    "it was shown that the reaction @xmath28 in the kinematical conditions of the disto @xcite or at cosy the presence of the @xmath8 signal is hindered by a large background .",
    "therefore , in principle , the process @xmath29 could be more favorable , because the cross section is one order higher , whereas the background is comparable with respect to @xmath30-collisions .",
    "note that the experimental study of @xmath31-production in the process @xmath32 , at an energy excess q=17 mev over threshold @xcite , gives the following value : @xmath33 nb , including the statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the extension of this study is foreseen @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive the most general and model independent properties for the processes of scalar meson production in @xmath34collisions , in the threshold region , where the theoretical analysis is essentially simplified .",
    "the spin structure of the corresponding matrix elements contains a set of sixteen independent amplitudes in the general case , eight amplitudes for coplanar kinematics and only three independent amplitudes in the threshold region .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , using the selection rules with respect to pauli principle , p - parity and total angular momentum , we establish the spin structure of the matrix elements for the processes @xmath35 and @xmath36 and analyze the polarization phenomena for these processes in a model independent way . in section iii",
    "we transform ( using the two - component fierz transformation ) different @xmath2channel contributions , which are described by a definite set of feynman diagrams , to the universal @xmath37-channel parametrization and find the expression for the corresponding partial threshold amplitudes . in section iv we discuss the predictions of a realistic model based on @xmath38-exchanges .",
    "a short discussion of final state interactions ( fsi ) is done in section v. in the conclusions we summarize the results obtained .",
    "the spin structure of the matrix elements for scalar meson production in @xmath34collisions , @xmath39 , in the threshold region is determined by the selection rules with respect to @xmath40-parity , total angular momentum and by the pauli principle .",
    "the threshold region , where all final particles in @xmath39 are produced in relative s - state , can be rigorously described by a formalism based on the two - component nucleon spinor parametrization of the corresponding matrix element .",
    "this formalism can be built in model independent way @xcite , and has been previously successfully applied to vector @xcite , pseudoscalar @xcite , and strange @xcite particle production in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "let us explicitly derive the matrix element for the processes @xmath35 , where @xmath41 denotes a neutral scalar meson , @xmath42 , @xmath8 or @xmath43 .",
    "due to the pauli principle , at the reaction threshold , only quantum numbers @xmath44 are allowed , where @xmath45 is the total angular momentum and @xmath40 is the @xmath40-parity of the colliding protons . only a single partial transition can take place",
    ", corresponding to : @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is the total spin of the initial ( final ) protons and @xmath49 is the angular orbital momentum of the colliding protons .    the spin structure of the threshold matrix element for the transition ( [ eq : eq1 ] )",
    ", in the cms of the considered reaction , can be parametrized in the following general form : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) are the two - component spinors of the initial ( final ) protons ; @xmath55 is the threshold partial amplitude , describing the singlet - singlet transition in the @xmath30-system ( with scalar meson production in the @xmath6-state ) , which is generally a complex function of three independent energies : @xmath56 ( the total invariant energy of the colliding particles ) , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( the energies of the scattered protons ) .",
    "so , all the dynamics of the considered process is included in the amplitude @xmath55 , but the exact form ( [ eq : mpp ] ) of the spin structure of the matrix element results from a generalized quantum mechanical kinematics .",
    "the pauli matrix @xmath59 , in the parametrization ( [ eq : mpp ] ) , insures the correct transformation properties of the corresponding two - component spinor products , relative to rotation .",
    "the presence of a single amplitude in ( [ eq : mpp ] ) implies that the spin directions of all the protons are fixed , with definite relative angles and fixed modules . in other words , all polarization phenomena for @xmath35 at threshold can be predicted without knowing the amplitude @xmath55 , i.e. _ in model independent way_. moreover , these polarization effects are the same for any scalar meson : @xmath12 , @xmath8 or @xmath43 . however , the absolute value of the cross section , which depends on @xmath60 , is different for different scalar mesons .",
    "all t - odd polarization observables ( i.e. one - spin and three - spin polarization correlations ) are identically zero .",
    "the dependence of the cross section on the polarizations @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the colliding protons can be written as : @xmath63 ( typical for the singlet @xmath0interaction ) , where @xmath64 is the phase space volume element for the three - particles final state and @xmath65 is the differential cross section with all unpolarized protons in initial and final states .",
    "all polarization transfer coefficients , characterizing the dependence of the polarization of any final proton from the polarization of the initial proton , vanish also .",
    "the situation is very different in case of @xmath66 collisions , @xmath36 , in the threshold region , where there are three allowed transitions : @xmath67 the corresponding matrix element can be written in the following form : @xmath68 \\left [ ( \\tilde\\chi_2\\sigma_y(\\sigma_a-\\hat{k_a } \\vec\\sigma\\cdot\\hat{\\vec k } ) \\chi_1\\right ] \\label{eq : mel}\\\\ & & + g_3(\\chi^{\\dagger}_4\\vec\\sigma\\cdot\\hat{\\vec k } \\sigma_y\\tilde\\chi^{\\dagger}_3 ) ( \\tilde\\chi_2\\sigma_y\\vec\\sigma\\cdot\\hat{\\vec k } \\chi_1 ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the unit vector along the three - momentum of the initial neutron beam , @xmath70 is the standard set of pauli matrices , and @xmath71 are the partial amplitudes for the @xmath1-interaction . due to the isotopic invariance of the strong interaction",
    "the following relation holds : @xmath72 i.e. the triplet - triplet amplitudes @xmath73 and @xmath74 are present only in @xmath1-collisions .",
    "therefore polarization phenomena in @xmath36 collisions are more complicated then in @xmath30-collisions .",
    "there is no universality here , polarization phenomena are different for the different scalar mesons .",
    "there is , however one general feature : all one - spin observables vanish , for @xmath36 , in particular the t - odd polarization of the final nucleons , emitted in the collisions of unpolarized nucleons and the analyzing powers in @xmath75- or @xmath76-collisions .",
    "the dependence of the differential cross section for @xmath77-collisions can be written in the following general form , which is correct near threshold : @xmath78 where the real spin correlation coefficients @xmath79 and @xmath80 are determined by the following formulas ( in terms of the partial threshold amplitudes @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) : @xmath83 the amplitudes @xmath81 are normalized in such way that : @xmath84 where @xmath65 is the differential cross section with unpolarized particles .",
    "so , from eqs .",

    "taking into account the isotopic relation ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) , one obtains : @xmath87    the dependence of the polarization @xmath88 of the final neutron on the polarization @xmath61 of the initial neutron can be parametrized as : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the spin transfer coefficients , which can be expressed in terms of the partial amplitudes @xmath81 : @xmath92}{|g_1|^2 + 2|g_2|^2+|g_3|^2}. \\label{eq : eq10}\\ ] ] the dependence of the polarization @xmath93 of the final proton on the polarization @xmath61 of the initial neutron can be also be parametrized in terms of two real coefficients : @xmath94 with the following formulas for @xmath95 and @xmath96 : @xmath97}{|g_1|^2 + 2|g_2|^2+|g_3|^2}. \\label{eq : eq12}\\ ] ] comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq : eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) , and ( [ eq : eq12 ] ) , one can find the following relation between these polarization observables : @xmath98 which has to be verified by any model describing this process .",
    "note that the isovector @xmath9-meson can be produced in the following processes of the @xmath99-interaction : @xmath100 it is possible to show that the production of the charged @xmath101-mesons -in the near threshold regime is characterized by a single amplitude , with the spin structure as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mpp ] ) , where the following relations hold : @xmath102 therefore the previous statements on polarization phenomena for @xmath35 apply also to the production of the charged @xmath101-mesons .",

    "some information exist on the coupling constants , but the threshold amplitudes for the processes ( [ eq : eq14 ] ) are poorly known , in particular for those processes that can not be experimentally studied . therefore model calculations have to be done , in order to find these amplitudes . in case of complex amplitudes not only the absolute values are important , but also the relative signs and phases .    in this section",
    "we analyze different @xmath2channel exchanges for the processes of scalar meson production in @xmath99-collisions , and give , when it is possible , model independent predictions .",
    "in other words , we will find expressions for the polarization phenomena in @xmath36 , which depend only on the quantum numbers , spin and parity @xmath116 , and isospin @xmath117 , of the exchanged meson , but not on the corresponding coupling constants , hadronic form factors and threshold amplitudes .",
    "let us consider the spin structure of the matrix element ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) for different exchanged particles .",
    "taking into account the identity of initial and final protons in @xmath35 , the @xmath12-exchange here is characterized by four different @xmath2channel diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "each diagram has a different spin structure , with different order of the two - component spinors @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "only the sum of all these diagrams , which satisfies the pauli principle for the initial and final protons , generates the correct spin structure ( [ eq : mpp ] ) , with a single amplitude @xmath55 . in threshold conditions",
    "the spin propagator for the considered diagrams is written as : @xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 are the masses of the nucleon , of the virtual @xmath12-meson , and of the produced scalar meson , correspondingly .",
    "such equality is correct at the reaction threshold , and it follows from the assumption of @xmath6-wave production of final particles .",
    "the difference in these propagators , which appears far from threshold , generates @xmath40- and higher waves of produced particles .",
    "the @xmath12-exchange for @xmath36 is described by two diagrams , only ( fig . [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : eq16 ] ) allow to predict all polarization phenomena in @xmath36 , independently on the details of the considered model , such as the value of the constant @xmath127 and the amplitude @xmath138 .",
    "one can find : @xmath139 @xmath140 in ( [ eq : eq18 ] ) we took into account the identity of the produced protons in the reaction @xmath35 .",
    "as in the case of @xmath12-exchange , the @xmath108-exchange generates four different diagrams for @xmath30-interaction and two diagrams for @xmath1-interaction .",
    "let us consider , therefore , the simplest case of @xmath36-processes , the matrix element of which can be written as : @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the coupling constant for the @xmath146-vertex , @xmath147 is the threshold amplitude for @xmath148 , which describes the partial transition : @xmath149 .",
    "the kinematical factor @xmath150 ( at threshold ) results from the transformation of the pseudoscalar vertex @xmath151 to its two - component equivalent @xmath152 .    after applying the fierz transformation to the spin structure ( [ eq : eq19 ] ) to the standard form , eq .",

    "( [ eq : eq17 ] ) and eq.([eq : eq21 ] ) , one can see that the polarization transfer coefficients , characterizing a change of neutron polarization , must be very sensitive to the quantum number of the isoscalar exchange in @xmath2channel , other polarization observables , such as @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 vanish for both exchanges @xmath118 and @xmath141 .",
    "any isovector exchange for the process @xmath36 is characterized by a set of four feynman diagrams fig .",

    "however numerical values of the polarization phenomena for the @xmath36 processes can be predicted exactly , without information on @xmath160 : @xmath161 and they are very different from the case of isoscalar exchange .",
    "another interesting result concerns the large difference in cross section , for @xmath30- and @xmath1-interaction : @xmath162 , i.e. for scalar meson production ( in @xmath34interaction ) we have large isotopic dependence .      in this case , both processes @xmath35 and @xmath36 is characterized by a set of four feynman diagrams , the neutral @xmath9-exchange for @xmath0collisions and the neutral+charged @xmath9-exchanges for @xmath1-collisions .",

    ", one can predict the following values for the polarization observables : @xmath169 they are different from the case of isoscalar exchange and from ( [ eq : eq25 ] ) . due to isovector exchange ,",
    "the isotopic ratio @xmath170 is large also in this case .",
    "combining the previously derived contributions , one can find for the threshold amplitudes @xmath81 the following expressions : @xmath171    let us note that the s - channel parametrization of the spin structure for the threshold matrix elements allows ( after applying the fierz transformation ) to unify different @xmath2channel contributions- with different @xmath116 - in universal and transparent form , which is well adapted to the analysis of the sensitivity of the polarization phenomena , in @xmath36 , to the quantum numbers of the @xmath2channel meson . such unification allows to simplify all calculations : we can express the matrix element for any exchange in terms of three amplitudes only , whereas , for example , a model with @xmath172 contains @xmath173 different feynman diagrams - with different spin structures .",
    "all these twelve contributions to the total matrix elements , in general , interfere , so it is in principle necessary to calculate @xmath174 terms , instead than @xmath175 terms , for the @xmath81 parametrization of the matrix elements . moreover , these nine terms are the same for any model , whereas , for example , adding vector exchanges will increase essentially the number of @xmath2contributions .",
    "another advantage of the @xmath176 fierz transformation is the explicit dependence of the observables on a definite combination of coupling constants , hadronic form factors and elementary amplitudes .",
    "this helps in finding out which contributions play the most important role in the @xmath2channel dynamics , and gives a feedback on the coupling constants by comparison with the experimental data .",
    "another important property of the partial amplitudes @xmath81 for @xmath66processes , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq26 ] ) , concerns a strong correlation of the spin and isospin structure of the matrix element in the threshold region .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath177 and @xmath178 , describing the @xmath1-interaction in the isotopic singlet state , are in general different , even in case of a definite isospin in t - channel , if the p - parity of the @xmath179-channel is not fixed .",
    "however , for definite @xmath116-exchanges , we have : @xmath180 the relations ( [ eq : eq27 ] ) hold also for any combination of isoscalar and isovector exchanges .",
    "the total cross section for @xmath36 is the incoherent sum of isosinglet and isotriplet contributions : @xmath181",
    "we analyze here in detail a model for @xmath39 , based on @xmath38-exchange . in order to justify such model ,",
    "let us mention that the @xmath108-contribution can be neglected , in ( [ eq : eq26 ] ) , due to the fact that the coupling constant @xmath145 is presently poorly known , being in the range 1@xmath182 @xcite . concerning the @xmath9-exchange , both the ingredients of such contribution",
    ", the coupling constant @xmath168 and the amplitude @xmath183 are presently not known .",
    "the mass of the @xmath9-meson is larger in comparison with the pion mass . in any case , the @xmath38-model can be considered a realistic starting point for the analysis , containing the exchange of mesons with different p - parities and isospin . as a result ,",
    "all three partial amplitudes are different : @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the ratio of the corresponding contributions : @xmath186 one can see that all the physics of this model ( with eight different feynman diagrams ) is contained in a single parameter @xmath185 , which is basically the ratio of the coupling constants and the elementary amplitudes . in the general case , the ratio @xmath185 is a complex parameter , which depends on the excitation energy of the produced @xmath187-system .",
    "therefore the polarization phenomena for the process @xmath36 and the ratio of cross section for @xmath1- and @xmath30-collisions , can be expressed in terms of two parameters @xmath188 and @xmath189 : @xmath190 the coefficients @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which characterize the polarized @xmath191-collisions , can be written as follows : @xmath192    the ratio @xmath185 can be found in framework of a model for the elementary subprocesses @xmath193 , under several assumptions concerning coupling constants , cut - off parameters , form factors ... to avoid the uncertainties related to these choices , we assume that @xmath185 is real . this is the case , for example , of the effective lagrangian approach , which gives real amplitudes and , therefore , real values for the ratio @xmath185 .",
    "another possibility is the saturation of the @xmath194 and @xmath195 amplitudes by a single nucleon resonance with @xmath196 .",
    "such mechanism produce complex amplitudes with zero relative phase , and @xmath185 is a real parameter , too .",
    "in this case we can predict the @xmath185-dependence of @xmath170 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ( figs . 4 - 6 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath197 of the corresponding cross sections can be very large in the region @xmath198 ( fig .",
    "the experimental determination of @xmath197 will allow to find two solutions for @xmath185 : @xmath199    the function @xmath200 has two extrema : the maximum at @xmath201 , where @xmath202 and a minimum at @xmath203 , where @xmath204 , see fig .",

    "in order to illustrate possible effects of fsi for the considered reaction , let us make an oversimplified estimation , using only the @xmath99-scattering length approximation , which will result in an upper limit for the nn - fsi .",
