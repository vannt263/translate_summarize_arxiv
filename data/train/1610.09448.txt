    "distances to astronomical objects are often difficult to estimate , but are of fundamental significance .",
    "they determine , for example , the source luminosity , the location in the galaxy or the universe and the space velocity , all important for studies of the origin , evolution and emission properties of the object in question .",
    "pulsars come with a built - in distance indicator , interstellar dispersion , which results in a radio - frequency - dependent delay @xmath0 in the pulse arrival times : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the charge and mass of the electron , @xmath4 is the velocity of light , @xmath5 is the radio frequency , @xmath6 is the local free electron density and the integral is along the path to the pulsar at distance @xmath7 .",
    "the electron column density along the path is known as the dispersion measure ( dm ) and can be measured using : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are observed pulse arrival times at frequencies @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "most of the @xmath132540 currently known pulsars are located within our galaxy  the 29 known extra - galactic pulsars are all in the magellanic clouds . of the known pulsars , @xmath132430 in the galaxy and 27 in the magellanic clouds have known dms ( the remainder were discovered at high energies and currently have no radio counterpart ) . figure  [ fg : dmgl ] shows the distribution of dms as a function of galactic longitude @xmath14 .    . [ fg : dmgl],width=321 ]    fast radio bursts ( frbs )",
    "are isolated millisecond - duration radio bursts that have dms that are much higher than expected from the galaxy , suggesting an extra - galactic origin .",
    "the first frb , discovered by @xcite , remained enigmatically alone for several years , but in the past few years many more have been detected , firmly establishing them as an extra - galactic phenomenon .",
    "one frb has been found to emit repeated pulses @xcite , suggesting a relationship with pulsars , especially rrats ( cf .",
    "* ) , but their origin remains a topic of great debate .",
    "however , this uncertainty about the nature of the source does not affect use of their dm as a distance indicator .    to make use of dms for pulsar or frb distance estimation , a model for the distribution of free electrons in the intervening interstellar medium ( ism ) or intergalactic medium ( igm )",
    "is required . in principle , at least for our galaxy and nearby galaxies , such a model could be derived directly from observations of recombination lines of ionised interstellar gas or radio thermal continuum radiation . in practice",
    "though , this is difficult .",
    "the intensity of both these types of radiation is related to the emission measure ( em ) , which is proportional to the integral of @xmath15 along the path .",
    "since the filling factor @xmath16 is largely unknown and variable along typical interstellar paths , conversion from em to dm is problematic .",
    "observed recombination lines and radio thermal continuum are dominated by regions of high density such as hii regions , whereas , except at low galactic latitudes , pulsar dispersion largely originates in the more widely distributed `` warm ionized medium '' ( wim ) which can be investigated using wide - field h@xmath17 observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even these observations are not useful for inner regions of the galaxy since they are affected by interstellar dust extinction which is difficult to quantify , especially when optical depths become high .",
    "the main components of a reasonable galactic @xmath6 model can be identified from our general knowledge of the distribution of molecular gas and star - formation regions in the galaxy , as well as h@xmath17 surveys of more local gas .",
    "for example , these can be used to define the spiral - arm structure in the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and suggest the presence of a `` thick '' electron disk with scale height @xmath131.5  kpc in addition to the `` thin '' disk defined by hii regions which has a scale height @xmath1370  pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the parameters describing the @xmath6 distribution generally can not be independently determined with sufficient precision .",
    "hence we are forced to use the observed dms of pulsars with independently known distances to calibrate the @xmath6 model . as is discussed further in ",
    "[ sec : inddist ] below , such independent distances can be obtained from measurements of pulsar parallax , pulsar associations with globular clusters or supernova remnants , optical observations of binary companions and kinematic distances based on observations of 21-cm hi absorption in pulsar spectra combined with a model for galactic rotation .",
    "an accurate model for the @xmath6 distribution in the galaxy has other important uses besides the direct estimation of pulsar distances .",
    "for example , it can help to identify pulsars that are likely to be in other galaxies such as the magellanic clouds by their excess dm over that expected from the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to firmly establish that `` fast radio bursts '' ( frbs ) are distant extra - galactic sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a knowledge of the @xmath6 distribution along the path is important for the interpretation of faraday rotation in pulsars and extra - galactic sources when investigating the large - scale structure of the galactic magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for the interpretation of measurements of interstellar scattering ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also important in investigations of the intergalactic medium , especially intergalactic magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one of the first attempts to construct a galactic @xmath6 model was by @xcite and @xcite . their model ( lmt85 ) consisted of two main components : a thin disk of scale height 70  pc and a @xmath18-independent component ( where @xmath18 is the perpendicular distance from the galactic plane )",
    ", both of which had a mid - plane electron density that tapered off with increasing galactocentric radius @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , the gum nebula @xcite was recognised as significantly modifying the dms of pulsars lying within or behind it and hence was included in the model as a separate term .",
    "the model was calibrated using the 36 pulsars with independent distances known at the time , mostly kinematic distances from hi absorption . at about the same time",
    "@xcite used data from the second molonglo pulsar survey to investigate the form of the @xmath6 distribution at @xmath20  5  kpc , concluding that , apart from an hii - region layer , the disk thickness was large .",
    "they presented a simple model that is very similar to the lmt85 model .",
    "the next major step forward was by @xcite , building on the work of @xcite , who included the effect of spiral structure in the model and also made use of the increased number of independent distances ( 74 ) and the overall dependence of pulsar dms on galactic longitude .",
    "for the first time , they also took into account observations of interstellar scattering .",
    "their `` tc93 '' model included both thin and thick galactic disks and made use of the sech@xmath21 function ] for the @xmath18-dependencies and some @xmath22-dependencies of @xmath6 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the sech@xmath21 function has a physical basis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ( unlike the exponential function ) has no cusp at @xmath23 , but is asymptotically exponential at large @xmath24 .    since 2002 , the `` ne2001 '' model @xcite has been the _ de facto _ standard for estimation of pulsar distances .",
    "this model makes use of 112 independent pulsar distances and scattering measures ( sms ) for 269 pulsars to define a model which includes both a quasi - smooth @xmath6 distribution and large - scale variations in the strength of the fluctuations in @xmath6 that result in interstellar scattering .",
    "the model includes multiple components : thin and thick axisymmetric disks , spiral arms , and local components including a local arm , a local hot bubble surrounding the sun and relatively large super - bubbles in the first and third galactic quadrants , together with over - dense components representing the gum nebula , the vela supernova remnant , galactic loop i and a small region around the galactic center .",
    "finally , ne2001 adds clumps toward pulsars with excess dm or scattering and toward active galactic nuclei ( agns ) that have excess scattering , and voids toward pulsars that have dms below those predicted by the quasi - smooth component .",
    "the model also uses sech@xmath25 dependencies and includes 67 parameters describing the main components , including parameters that describe the @xmath6 fluctuation amplitudes in each component .",
    "another 493 parameters were used to describe 82 clumps and 137 parameters to describe 17 voids .",
    "an iterative approach was used to fit the parameters to the available data , first solving for the parameters of the large - scale quasi - smooth components , then adding the clumps and voids and other local features and refitting as necessary @xcite .",
    "compared to the tc93 model , distances obtained from ne2001 are generally smaller , especially for high - latitude pulsars which in many cases had unbounded distances in the tc93 model .",
    "this mainly results from ne2001 having a denser thick disk ( @xmath26  @xmath27 , @xmath28  pc ) compared to tc93 ( @xmath29  @xmath27 , @xmath30  pc ) , where @xmath31 is the mid - plane electron density for the thick disk and @xmath32 is its scale height .    in the next few years , the population of known pulsars increased significantly , mainly as a result of the parkes multibeam pulsar survey , and several groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) began to notice that ne2001 systematically under - estimates the @xmath18-distance of high - latitude pulsars . to address this , @xcite analysed just high - latitude pulsars ( @xmath33 ) that are not contaminated by hii regions or spiral arms along the path .",
    "they obtained a smaller mid - plane density , @xmath34  @xmath27 , and a much larger ( exponential ) scale height @xmath35  pc .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out a bias in the fitting method used by @xcite and obtained a revised scale height of @xmath36  pc .",
    "for both the exponential and sech@xmath25 distributions , the @xmath37 product is equal to the `` perpendicular dm '' ( dm@xmath38 ) , i.e. , the dm integrated to infinity perpendicular to the galactic disk . for the tc93 , n2001 , @xcite and @xcite fits , dm@xmath38 is , respectively , 16.5  @xmath27  pc , 33.0  @xmath27  pc , 25.6  @xmath27  pc and 21.9  @xmath27  pc .",
    "@xcite also estimated a mid - plane volume filling factor ( @xmath39 ) for the thick - disk electrons of 0.014 , rising to around 0.3 at @xmath401000  pc . )",
    "is related to the line - of - sight filling factor @xmath41 by a form - dependent factor which is of order unity @xcite . ]",
    "based on accurate parallax measurements using the vlba , @xcite also showed that the ne2001 model under - predicts distances for several high - latitude pulsars by a factor of two , but also over - predicts distances for several relatively local pulsars .",
    "these results illustrate the clumpy nature of the ism on scales of 100  1000  pc .",
    "an analysis by @xcite considered a range of modified tc93 and ne2001 models with different parameters for the thick disk .",
    "these were tested using a sample of 41 pulsars with @xmath42 , having well - determined independent distances and unaffected by hii regions in the path . a modified tc93 model with a scale height of @xmath43  pc and the same @xmath37 product as tc93 gave the most consistently accurate predictions .",
    "in this work we present a new `` ymw16 '' model for the large - scale distribution of free electrons in the galaxy , the magellanic clouds and the intergalactic medium .",
    "the galactic part of the model has the same basic structure as tc93 and ne2001 but also some important differences compared to these earlier models .",
    "for example , we adopt a four - armed spiral pattern ( plus a `` local arm '' ) with the location and form of the arms as given by @xcite based on observations of more than 1800 hii regions across the galaxy .",
    "the ymw16 model is fitted to a compilation of 189 independent pulsar distance estimates , using global and local optimization algorithms .",
    "there are seven local features in the ymw16 model : the local bubble ( lb ) , two regions of enhanced @xmath6 on the periphery of the local bubble ( lb1 , lb2 ) , the gum nebula ( gn ) , loop i ( li ) , a region of enhanced @xmath6 in the carina arm and a region of reduced @xmath6 in the sagittarius tangential region .",
    "most of these features are also included in the ne2001 model .",
    "in contrast to both tc93 and ne2001 , we do not make use of observations of interstellar scattering in building the model .",
    "numerous observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that interstellar scattering is typically dominated by just a few regions of very strong @xmath6 fluctuations along the path to a pulsar .",
    "this makes it essentially impossible to satisfactorily model the large - scale distribution of interstellar scattering and leads to the very large scatter seen in plots of sm and scattering delay @xmath44 versus dm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another major difference between ne2001 and ymw16 is that we do not attempt to correct discrepant model distances for individual pulsars by invoking clumps or voids in their direction .",
    "we believe that this procedure should be deprecated as it is likely to lead to poor distance estimates for future discoveries ( or even for currently known pulsars ) that have adjacent lines of sight . we have only invoked additional features beyond the large - scale model where a number of pulsars in a given region have discrepant distances and/or where there is good independent evidence for such features .",
    "this policy of course leads to more pulsars having over - estimated or under - estimated distances , but this is an unavoidable consequence of our current inability to adequately model the small - scale structure in the ism .    with the advent of frb astronomy and the likely increase in the number and distribution of extra - galactic pulsars with increasingly sensitive searches ,",
    "there is a strong motivation to include extra - galactic components in the electron - density model .",
    "we model the dm contributions of the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc , smc ) based on prior information on their shape , size and distance and making use of the dms of the 27 pulsars believed to be associated with either the lmc or smc .",
    "we also include components for the igm and the host galaxy to allow distance estimates for frbs .",
    "the arrangement of our paper is as follows .",
    "pulsars with dm - independent distance estimates or limits and the methods by which these are obtained are discussed in  [ sec : inddist ] . in  [ sec : model ] we describe the functional form of the model components and in  [ sec : model - fit ] we describe the model fitting procedure and the algorithms used for global optimization and local optimization .",
    "results from the model fitting are presented and compared with the predictions of the tc93 and ne2001 models in  [ sec : results ] . a summary our results and concluding remarks are given in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "tables of dm - independent distances and limits , and corresponding model distances are given in appendix a. details of the algorithms used to compute perpendicular distances from spiral arms and the gum nebula are given in appendix b. coordinate conversions for the lmc are given in appendix c and the ymw16 program code and outputs are described in appendix d.",
    "there are a variety of ways that pulsar distances can be estimated independent of their dm and the galactic @xmath6 model . as described above , these independent distances are essential for the calibration of any model for the @xmath6 distribution .",
    "we have obtained independent distance data for 189 pulsars from the atnf pulsar catalogue ( v1.54 ) , only including pulsars with both upper and lower limits on the estimated distance and known dms .",
    "only one pulsar from each globular cluster association ( and the double pulsar ) is included .",
    "parallax measurements of low significance are also omitted . in this section",
    "we discuss the different methods of obtaining independent distances ; the adopted distances are listed in appendix a for each category .",
    "measurements of annual parallax give a direct measure of the pulsar distance .",
    "such measurements can be made in two different ways : a ) fitting for annual parallax in precision timing solutions and b ) direct measurements of position shifts due to annual parallax using very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "of the 70 parallax measurements listed in table  [ tb : a1_px ] , about 40 are based on vlbi observations , one ( psr j0633 + 1746 ) on optical astrometry with the hubble space telescope , and the remainder on pulse timing analyses .",
    "measured parallaxes of low significance are biased by the `` lutz - kelker '' effect @xcite .",
    "this has been considered in the context of pulsar parallax measurements by @xcite and we have adopted their corrected distance estimates where available .",
    "otherwise , we have ignored parallax measurements with a value less than three times the quoted uncertainty .    for three of the entries in table  [ tb : a1_px ] ( psrs j0437@xmath454715 , j1537 + 1155 and j2129@xmath455721 ) ,",
    "the distance estimate is based on a measure of the time - derivative of the orbital period @xmath46 .",
    "if a signficant excess @xmath46 ( over that expected from general - relativistic decay of the orbit ) is measured , then this excess can be attributed to the shklovskii effect @xcite and a distance estimate obtained @xcite .",
    "for these three pulsars , the @xmath47 distance is the most precise distance estimate available .      for low - latitude pulsars ,",
    "21-cm absorption spectra resulting from dense hi clouds in the path can be used to obtain pulsar distance limits by using a galactic rotation model to convert radial velocities of clouds to distances .",
    "lower and upper distance limits correspond to the presence and absence of absorption features , but upper distance limits are always more difficult to estimate . also for `` inner '' lines of sight ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) difficulties arise due to ambiguities about whether a given spectral feature corresponds to absorbing gas at the `` near '' distance ( closer than the tangent point ) or the `` far''distance ( beyond the tangential point ) .",
    "generally , emission features with @xmath50  k correspond to significant absorption and this has been used a criterion to decide on distance limits @xcite .",
    "table  [ tb : a1_kin ] gives kinematic distances derived from hi absorption and emission spectra for 62 pulsars .",
    "parallax distances are always underestimated because of the lutz - kelker bias but kinematic distances tend to be over - estimated because of a luminosity bias .",
    "again , this bias was considered by @xcite and we have adopted their limits when available .",
    "because of the difficulties in interpretation of observed spectra , hi kinematic distances are generally less reliable than those derived using other methods .",
    "many ( mostly ) millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are associated with globular clusters - it is clear that the dense cores of these clusters have conditions that are favourable for the recycling of pulsars to form msps .",
    "distances to clusters are obtained by a variety of methods including astrometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our database",
    "we include just one pulsar for each cluster , but assign to it a dm averaged over the pulsars in that cluster .",
    "table  [ tb : a1_gc ] lists the 27 clusters and pulsars for which distances have been obtained from observations of the associated globular cluster .",
    "globular clusters are all at large distances from the sun and these associations are of great importance in defining the distance model , especially for larger @xmath18-distances .",
    "about 60 young pulsars are associated with supernova remnants ( snr ) but many of these were discovered at x - ray or @xmath51-ray wavelengths and have no radio counterpart .",
    "consequently their dm is unknown and they are not useful as independent distances for @xmath6 modelling .",
    "table  [ tb : a1_neb ] lists 14 pulsars that are associated with snr or pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) , have a known dm and an estimated distance based on the association . in this table",
    "we also include a pulsar ( psr j0248 + 6021 ) that is believed to lie in or near the hii region w5 @xcite and the magnetar psr j1745@xmath452900 that is believed to lie close to the galactic center @xcite .",
    "although about 250 pulsars are members of a binary system , in orbit with another star , in only a few cases is the companion star optically identified .",
    "table  [ tb : a1_stars ] gives the nine published independent distance estimates based on optical identifications .",
    "up to now , pulsars believed to lie outside our galaxy have only been found in the magellanic clouds , our nearest neighbor galaxies .",
    "a total of 29 pulsars are known in the clouds , six in the smc and 23 in the lmc .",
    "however , only 27 of these have known dm , with one pulsar in each of the smc and lmc being detected only at high energies .",
    "these 27 pulsars are listed in table  [ tb : a1_mc ] along with their nominal distance estimates and limits which refer to the center of each cloud .",
    "the magellanic clouds form an important step in the extra - galactic distance ladder and so extensive studies of cepheid and rr lyrae variables have been carried out in order to estimate their distances .",
    "for the lmc we have adopted the distance modulus of @xmath52 given by @xcite , which corresponds to a distance of @xmath53  kpc . for the smc ,",
    "we adopt the value from @xcite : distance modulus @xmath54 corresponding to a distance of @xmath55  kpc .      currently , there are 17 known frbs as listed in table  [ tb : a1_frb ] @xcite",
    ". only one of these , frb150418 , has an identification of the host galaxy , an elliptical galaxy at @xmath56 @xcite , although this identification has been disputed @xcite .",

    "there is extensive evidence from hi surveys ( see * ? ? ?",

    "they estimate an @xmath15 scale height for the wim in this region of about 430  pc , corresponding to @xmath89860  pc given the same assumptions .",
    "these results suggest that there is no strong dependence of @xmath82 on galactocentric radius out to the edge of the galactic disk .",
    "they also support the relative independence of wim h@xmath17 intensity and hence of @xmath6 as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "preliminary fits to the independent distance data including @xmath19-dependencies of @xmath6 and/or @xmath82 were less successful than those omitting them .",

    "a survey of distant hii regions by @xcite finds the last significant concentration peaking at @xmath99  kpc , with only a few at @xmath100  kpc .",

    "this allows for some ionisation beyond most of the known hii regions .    despite the assumption of a plane - parallel thick disk",
    ", there are good reasons to suggest that the density of the thick disk is reduced in the vicinity of the galactic center .",

    "secondly , observations of the so - called `` fermi bubbles '' ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we model the fermi bubbles as ellipsoidal cavities in the thick disk that extend to @xmath106 and @xmath107 and touch at the galactic centre .",

    "in this paper we have constructed a new model , ymw16 , for the distribution of thermal free electrons in the galaxy with the main aim of providing more reliable distance estimates for real or simulated pulsars based on their dispersion measure .",
    "the model also includes contributions from the magellanic clouds and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , enabling distance estimates for extra - galactic pulsars and frbs .",
    "the galactic model is based on independently determined distances for 189 pulsars .",
    "as tabulated in appendix  a , these model - indepependent distances are derived from measurements of annual parallax , hi absorption together with a kinematic model for galactic rotation , associations with globular clusters , supernova remnants or ( in one case ) an hii region or distance estimates for binary companion stars .",
    "while we estimate the amount of pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering for galactic and magellanic cloud pulsars and frbs , we do not use scattering data as an input to the model .",
    "the main components of the model are as follows : a plane parallel thick disk with a scale height of about 1600  pc , a thin disk of scale height about 65  pc mainly representing the `` molecular ring '' of the galaxy around 4  kpc galactocentric radius , spiral arms following a logarithmic spiral pattern based on the galactic distribution of hii regions @xcite , a galactic center disk of radius 160  pc and scale height 35  pc , an ellipsoidal shell with major axis in the @xmath18 direction representing the gum nebula , the local bubble , a region of reduced @xmath6 surrounding the sun , together with regions of enhanced density on the periphery of the bubble , and a hemispherical shell of enhanced density associated with the nearby galactic loop i. the carina - sagittarius spiral arm has a region of enhanced @xmath6 on the carina side and a region of depressed @xmath6 on the sagittarius side .",

    "the smc is modelled as a spherical distribution and the lmc as an inclined disk with an additional component representing the giant hii region 30 doradus .",

    "values of the fixed and fitted parameters and their uncertainties are given in section  [ sec : model ] and table  [ tb : params ] and the overall form of the model is shown in figure  [ fg : ne_model ] .",
    "of the 189 galactic pulsars , the model distance is within the uncertainties of the independent distance for 86 pulsars and within 20% of the nearest limit for a further 38 pulsars . by repeatedly selecting a random sample containing 184 of the 189 pulsars , refitting the model to these 184 pulsars and checking the model prediction for the remaining five pulsars",
    ", we estimate that 95% of model predictions will have a relative error of less than 90% .",
    "comparison of the ymw16 model distances with those of the tc93 and ne2001 models for the full sample of 189 pulsars showed that the new model performs substantially better , especially for high - latitude pulsars .",
    "however , this is not a fair comparison as we have the advantage of fitting the full 189-pulsar sample whereas tc93 and ne2001 did not . for a fairer comparison we compared the model predictions from the repeated fitting the randomly chosen 184-pulsar sample with predictions of the tc93 and ne2001 models for a sample of 71 pulsars with recently determined independent distances .",
    "this showed that ymw16 is expected to perform about 50% better than ne2001 and 100% better than tc93 in estimating pulsar distances based on their dm .",
    "while the ymw16 model performs significantly better than earlier models in predicting the distances of pulsars based on their dm , there is certainly room for improvement . at present",
    "less than 10% of known pulsars have independently determined distances and only about 8% have sufficiently accurate distance estimates to be useful .",
    "more than 75% of these are located within 5  kpc of the sun .",
    "new relatively precise independent distance estimates , especially for more distant pulsars , will enable us both to better test the model and to improve it .",
    "currently the model contains 15 components describing the @xmath6 distribution in the galaxy , including five spiral arms and seven relatively local features such as the carina excess and the gum nebula . the highly anomalous prediction for psr j0248 + 6021 highlights the effect of hii regions on the predicted distances .",
    "ymw16 includes the several relatively local over - dense regions , but does not attempt to model more distant hii regions such as w5 .",
    "a future iteration of the model would benefit from inclusion of at least the larger and denser hii regions within a few kpc of the sun .",
    "it is however impossible to model the detailed structure of the ism throughout the galaxy or even within the relatively local region , and so it is inevitable that there will be errors and uncertainties in the predicted distances .",
    "the ymw16 model is the first to include models ( albeit relatively simple models ) for the @xmath6 distribution in the large and small magellanic clouds and for the intergalactic medium .",
