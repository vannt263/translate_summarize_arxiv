    "<S> we consider the most general renormalizable chiral yukawa model with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath1 , @xmath2 replaced by @xmath3 and @xmath4 replaced by @xmath5 in the limit @xmath6 , @xmath7 with the ratio @xmath8 held fixed . </S>",
    "<S> since for @xmath9 only one renormalizable yukawa coupling per family exists and there is no mixing between families the limit is appropriate for the description of the effects of a heavy top quark when all the other fermions are taken to be massless . the large @xmath10 expansion is expected to be no worse quantitatively in this model that in the purely scalar case and the @xmath11 limit is soluble even when the model is regularized non  perturbatively . </S>",

    "<S> perturbatively a model that is reasonably close to what the minimal standard model would look like if the top quark yukawa coupling and the higgs selfcoupling were both large while all other couplings were kept at their known small values and could therefore be neglected in a first approximation </S>",

    "<S> perturbatively with a pauli villars type of regularization@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the action is :      where @xmath15 the @xmath16 are pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> ultraviolet divergences can be eliminated by just regularizing the @xmath17 and @xmath18 propagators because there are no loops consisting of only @xmath19 propagators . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved with @xmath20 with @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 represents the top  bottom doublet , @xmath17 the right handed top and @xmath18 the higgs doublet . the index @xmath22 generalizes the weak isospin index and the index @xmath23 labels colors . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 is a euclidean left handed weyl spinor , @xmath25 a right handed one and @xmath18 a complex scalar . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are independent fields of handedness opposite to their unbarred counterparts as usual in the euclidean functional integral formulation .    the large @xmath28 limit is taken with @xmath29 held fixed and is dominated by planar diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> renormalizability allows us to get away with not having to introduce four fermion interactions and with them an insoluble planar diagram problem , at no cost to generality . </S>",
    "<S> thus the model is manageable being similar diagrammatically to two dimensional qcd with matter at large @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the large @xmath28 limit can be found by looking at the structure of planar feynman graphs : essentially one sums over all `` cactuses of bubbles '' and all `` rainbows '' . for future work </S>",
    "<S> it is somewhat preferable to use functional integral manipulations to the same end .    as an example of what can be done in this scheme we present a very simple calculation : we compute a @xmath31function associated with the yukawa coupling constant defined in some simple manner and ignoring cutoff effects </S>",
    "<S> this can be done with relative ease because even at infinite order in the couplings the flow of this yukawa coupling is unaffected by @xmath32 , similarly to the finite @xmath28 form at one loop order . from this calculation </S>",
    "<S> a rough estimate for the `` triviality '' bound on the top mass can be obtained .    to find @xmath31 functions it suffices to solve the model at criticality when all masses vanish . </S>",
    "<S> we start in the symmetric phase and pick a mass independent renormalization scheme to make the zero mass limit smooth .    </S>",
    "<S> we introduce bilocal fields , @xmath33 where @xmath34 are space  time spinor indices , into the functional integral by writing representations for the appropriate @xmath35functions with the help of two auxiliary bilocal fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we can integrate out now all the original fields , including the zero mode of the scalar field because we assumed that we are in the symmetric phase . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the @xmath28 and @xmath38 dependence explicit and , when @xmath39 , the integral over @xmath40 and @xmath41 is dominated by a saddle point which has to satisfy the following equations : @xmath42^{-1}\\}_{y , x}\\cr s_{\\alpha , \\beta}(x , y)=\\ { [ h_{\\chi}(-\\partial^2 ) \\sla\\partial_{- } + \\lambda ] ^{-1}\\}_{y\\beta , x\\alpha}\\cr \\lambda_{\\alpha , \\beta}(x , y)=-g^2 \\bar\\rho \\sqrt{2 } \\{\\sla\\partial_{+}^{-1}\\}_{x\\alpha , y\\beta } k(x , y)\\cr \\mu ( x , y ) = { { g^2}\\over{\\bar\\rho\\sqrt{2}}}\\sum_{\\alpha , \\beta } \\{\\sla\\partial_{+}^{-1}\\}_{x\\alpha , y\\beta } s_{\\alpha , \\beta } ( x , y ) \\cr+{{\\lambda_0 } \\over { 2 } } k(x , x)\\delta_{x , y } \\label{eq : sp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we go to fourier space and use translational and rotational invariance to write @xmath43 let us introduce @xmath44 and @xmath45 , wave function renormalization constants , and new functions @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 $ ] . since at the planar level there are no vertex corrections to the yukawa coupling . ] </S>",
    "<S> it makes sense to define a renormalized yukawa coupling by @xmath48 , ( @xmath49 ) . </S>",

    "<S> the equations above show that if this is true in some interval @xmath72 then the functions will be monotonically decreasing there . </S>",
    "<S> however , the equation do not admit an asymptotic behavior as @xmath73 with both functions approaching non  negative limits so the positivity requirement must get violated somewhere in the ultraviolet . or @xmath71 at a positive @xmath67 corresponds to a pole in a two  point function at an euclidean momentum ; the `` particle '' associated with this pole would be tachyonic . ] starting at the scale where the violation first occurs cutoff effects can not be neglected any more . </S>",
    "<S> this `` unphysical '' scale is the usual landau pole , this time appearing in a nonperturbative approximation .    in the infrared </S>",
    "<S> there is no landau pole problem and cutoff effects are indeed negligible . </S>",
    "<S> to investigate the behavior there we set @xmath74 and @xmath75 and derive : @xmath76    these equations allow us to extract the infrared behavior of the solution of the integral equations . </S>",
    "<S> we ended up with only differential equations ( rather than integral ) reflecting that according to the renormalization group one needs only very limited information at a given scale in order to derive the behavior at a scale close by ; therefore a differential equation must show up eventually , its order less the number of asymptotic conditions determining the amount of information at a given scale that is needed to determine the behavior at the next scale . </S>",
    "<S> our choice of regularization was made so that even at finite cutoff @xmath77 and @xmath78 obey a set of purely differential equations of a structure similar to  [ eq : diffeqs ] .    since the fixed point governing </S>",
    "<S> the infrared behavior is the free field fixed point the form of the solutions in the infrared simply embodies the two anomalous dimensions associated with the @xmath17 and @xmath18 fields when expanded in @xmath51 around @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> these anomalous dimensions as a function of the coupling also determine the @xmath31 function and from the asymptotic series of @xmath80 and @xmath81 at @xmath82 we can get the contributions to the @xmath83 function ordered in the number of loops .    </S>",

    "<S> the difference comes from the wave function renormalization of the left handed @xmath19 field which is suppressed at leading order in @xmath13 . for arbitrary @xmath30 and @xmath102 </S>",
    "<S> we would have obtained at one loop order @xmath103 and we see that the relative magnitude of the @xmath104 correction is much smaller than in the scalar case@xcite .    to get the full @xmath31function at infinite @xmath28 we solve for @xmath78 and @xmath77 numerically by iterating an integral form of the equations  [ eq : inteqs ] but with the normalization conditions at @xmath68 incorporated ; this avoids the appearance of the double integrals in  [ eq : dblint ] and  [ eq : inteqcont ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the result for @xmath31 is shown in the figure and one again sees explicit evidence for the nonperturbative existence of a landau pole . </S>",

    "<S> we see that `` triviality bounds '' on the top will likely come out close to the perturbative unitarity bounds of chanowitz et . </S>",
