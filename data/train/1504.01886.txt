    "<S> in contrast , for @xmath103 , despite a smaller total number of scattered photons , aggregate decoherence is strong .    </S>",
    "<S> the connection between information provided by the scattered photon and decoherence is explicit in the quantum - jump algorithm : the inset of fig .  [ many_body_simulations ]  ( b ) shows for a single realization how the state of the aggregate @xmath104 ( blue dashed ) is linked to quantum jumps of the @xmath11 population of its probe atom ( green ) . </S>",
    "<S> this link only occurs when the state of the background atom and the state of the aggregate are significantly entangled in the moment of spontaneous decay . since this is not the case in panel ( a ) , single trajectories ( not plotted ) there show no effect of quantum jumps on the state of the aggregate .    _ conclusions and outlook : </S>",
    "<S> _ we have shown that a rydberg aggregate embedded in an optically coupled background gas realizes a flexible quantum simulator of a haken - reineker - strobl type model for energy transport . </S>",
    "<S> site - dependent dephasing and disorder can be controlled through laser intensities , frequencies and background atomic density . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this system could be extended to study other fundamental features believed to be at play in photosynthetic light - harvesting : we have seen evidence for non - markovian features and non - trivial relaxation when the time scale on which the background atoms reach their steady state is made comparable to transport time scales , a regime not discussed here . </S>",
    "<S> the analogue of internal molecular vibrations could be engineered as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> disorder distributions could be controlled even further using an additional class of background atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these features would extend the hrs type model proposed here to quantum simulations of light - harvesting processes in a similar spirit but with complementary technology to the proposals of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> decoherence of the aggregate arises through continuous monitoring of the location of the excitation , providing a hands - on example of measurement - induced decoherence of a quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> further applications of this system could be monitoring and decoherence of adiabatic excitation transport involving external ( motional ) degrees of freedom @xcite .    </S>",
