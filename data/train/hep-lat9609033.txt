    "as t  hooft pointed out , a nonabelian gauge theory is reduced into an abelian gauge theory with monopoles by the abelian gauge fixing [ 1,2 ] .",
    "recent lattice studies suggest abelian dominance and relevant roles of monopole condensation [ 3 ] for the nonperturbative phenomena : confinement [ 4 ] , chiral symmetry breaking [ 5 ] and instantons [ 5 - 8 ] . in the abelian gauge , unit - charge monopoles appear from the hedgehog - like gauge configuration according to the nontrivial homotopy group , @xmath1 [ 2 ] .",
    "on the other hand , the instanton is another relevant topological object in the nonabelian gauge manifold ( @xmath2 = @xmath3 ) . in the abelian - dominant system",
    ", the instanton seems to lose the topological basis for its existence , and hence it seems unable to survive in the abelian manifold [ 7 - 9 ] .",
    "however , even in the abelian gauge , nonabelian components remain relatively large around the topological defect , _ i.e. _ monopoles , and therefore instantons are expected to survive only around the monopole world lines in the abelian - dominant system [ 7 - 9 ] .",
    "we have pointed out such a close relation between instantons and monopoles , and have demonstrated it in the continuum yang - mills theory using the polyakov gauge , where @xmath4 is diagonalized [ 7 - 9 ] .",
    "we summarize our previous analytical works as follows [ 7 - 9 ] .",
    "+ ( 1 ) each instanton center is penetrated by a monopole world line in the polyakov gauge , because @xmath4 takes a hedgehog configuration near the instanton center . in other words ,",
    "instantons only live along the monopole trajectory . + ( 2 ) even at the classical level , the monopole trajectory is unstable against a small fluctuation of the location or the size of instantons , although it is relatively stable inside the instanton profile .",
    "+ ( 3 ) in the two - instanton solution , a loop or folded structure appears in the monopole trajectory depending on the instanton location and size .",
    "+ ( 4 ) in the multi - instanton solution , monopole trajectories become very unstable and complicated . + ( 5 ) at a high temperature ,",
    "the monopole trajectories are drastically changed , and become simple lines along the temporal direction .    to begin with , we study the monopole trajectory in the multi - instanton system in terms of the topological charge density as a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "we show in fig.1 an example of the monopole trajectory in the polyakov gauge in the multi - instanton system , where all instantons are randomly put on the @xmath5-plane for simplicity [ 8 ] .",
    "the contour denotes the magnitude of the topological density .",
    "each instanton attaches the monopole trajectory . as the instanton density increases",
    ", the monopole trajectory tends to be highly complicated and very long , which can be regarded as a signal of monopole condensation [ 3,10 ] . as a remarkable feature in the polyakov gauge , the monopole favors the high topological density region , `` mountain '' : each monopole trajectory walks crossing tops of the mountain [ 8 ] . on the other hand , anti - monopole with the opposite color - magnetic charge favors the low topological density region ,  valley \" .",
    "thus , the strong local correlation is found between the instanton and the monopole trajectory [ 6 - 9 ] .",
    "fig.1 : the monopole trajectory in the polyakov gauge in the multi - instanton solution , where 150 instantons are put on the @xmath5 plane .",
    "the contour denotes the magnitude of the topological density .",
    "next , we study the correlation between instantons and monopoles in the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge and in the polyakov gauge using the monte carlo simulation in the su(2 ) lattice gauge theory [ 5 - 8 ] .",
    "the su(2 ) link variable can be separated into the monopole - dominating ( singular ) part and the photon - dominating ( regular ) part [ 4,5,7 - 8 ] . using the cooling method",
    ", we measure the topological quantities ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) in the monopole and photon sectors as well as in the ordinary su(2 ) sector . here",
    ", @xmath8 corresponds to the total number @xmath9 of instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "\\(1 ) on the @xmath10 lattice with @xmath11 , we find that instantons exist only in the monopole part both in the ma and polyakov gauges , which means monopole dominance for the topological charge [ 5,7,8 ] .",
    "hence , we can expect monopole dominance for the u@xmath12(1 ) anomaly and the @xmath13 mass .",
    "\\(2 ) we study the finite - temperature system using the @xmath0 lattice with various @xmath14 around @xmath15 [ 8 ] .",
    "we show in fig.2 the correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are measured in the su(2 ) and monopole sectors , respectively , after 50 cooling sweeps .",
    "the monopole part holds the dominant topological charge in the full su(2 ) gauge configuration . on the other hand , @xmath18 , measured in the photon part , vanishes quickly by several cooling sweeps .",
    "thus , monopole dominance for the instanton is found also in the confinement phase even at finite temperatures [ 8 ] .",
    "\\(3 ) near the critical temperature @xmath15 , a large reduction of @xmath7 is observed . in the deconfinement phase",
    ", @xmath7 vanishes quickly by several cooling sweeps , which means the absence of the instanton , in the su(2 ) and monopole sectors as well as in the photon sector [ 8 ] .",
    "therefore , the gauge configuration becomes similar to the photon part in the deconfinement phase .",
    "fig.2 : correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath14=2.2 ( @xmath19 ) , 2.3 ( @xmath20 ) , 2.35 ( @xmath21 ) after 50 cooling sweeps .",
    "thus , monopole dominance for instantons is found in the confinement phase even at finite temperatures , and the monopole part includes a dominant amount of instantons as well as the monopole current [ 5,7 ] . at the deconfinement phase transition , both the instanton density and the monopole current",
    "are rapidly reduced , and the qcd - vacuum becomes trivial in terms of the topological nontriviality . because of such strong correlation between instantons and monopoles , monopole dominance for the nonperturbative qcd may be interpreted as instanton dominance .",
    "finally , we study the correlation between the instanton number and the monopole loop length .",
    "our analytical studies suggest appearance of a highly complicated monopole trajectory in the multi - instanton system even at the classical level [ 7 - 9 ] .",
    "further monopole clustering would be brought by quantum effects .",
    "we conjecture that the existence of instantons promotes monopole condensation [ 7 - 9 ] , which is characterized by a long complicated monopole trajectory covering over @xmath22 in the similar argument for the kosterlitz - thouless transition [ 10 ] and is observed also in the lattice qcd simulation [ 3,4,8 ] .",
    "to clarify the role of instantons on monopole condensation , we study the su(2 ) lattice gauge theory for the total monopole - loop length @xmath23 and the integral of the absolute value of the topological density @xmath7 , which corresponds to the total number @xmath9 of instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "3 the correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath23 in the ma gauge after 10 cooling sweeps on the @xmath24 lattice with various @xmath14 . a linear - type correlation is clearly found between @xmath7 and @xmath23 .",
    "hence , the monopole - loop length would be largely enhanced in the dense instanton system .",
    "fig.3 : correlation between the total monopole - loop length @xmath23 and @xmath7 ( the total number of instantons and anti - instantons ) in the ma gauge .",
    "we plot the data at 10 cooling sweep on @xmath0 lattice with various @xmath14 .    from the above results , we propose the following conjecture .",
    "each instanton accompanies a small monopole loop nearby , whose length would be proportional to the instanton size [ 11 - 14 ] . when @xmath9 is large enough , these monopole loops overlap , and there appears a very long monopole trajectory , which bonds neighboring instantons [ 8,11 ] . such a monopole clustering leads to monopole condensation and color confinement [ 10 ] .",
    "thus , instantons would play a relevant role on color confinement by providing a source of the monopole clustering [ 7 - 9,11 ] .",
