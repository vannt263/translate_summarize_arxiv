    "but for @xmath243 we set @xmath327 .",
    "we take @xmath328 in ( [ pilb ] ) as we may since @xmath329 as @xmath233 . with this",
    "set - up , ( [ ac ] ) is true ( with @xmath174 replacing @xmath243 ) and we can follow the proof of case ( a ) through to get ( [ ac1 ] ) with @xmath330 and @xmath243 replaced by @xmath174 ; thus , @xmath331 estimating @xmath332 along the lines of ( [ vest ] ) we find the right - hand side of ( [ ac10 ] ) is not smaller than @xmath333 choose @xmath272 large enough in this to get ( [ ag ] ) , and hence ( [ bn ] ) with @xmath174 in place of @xmath330 , hence ( [ 3.6as ] ) again .",
    "assume that @xmath334 .",
    "define @xmath335 by ( [ ddef ] ) , so we have ( [ dprop ] ) .",
    "then ( [ xlb3 ] ) with @xmath328 and @xmath336 , together with ( [ 3.7s ] ) , shows that we must have @xmath337 for all large @xmath188 . here",

    "t_kd_+ \\bigl(\\overline { \\pi } ^-(0+)-\\overline{\\pi}^-(d_+ ) \\bigr)\\ ] ] from both sides of ( [ ac7 ] ) gives @xmath341 on the left , and a quantity no smaller than @xmath342 on the right . further adding @xmath343 to both sides gives ( see ( [ ip ] ) )",
    "@xmath344    at this stage , as before , assume @xmath262 is continuous .",
    "it then follows from ( [ dprop ] ) that @xmath263 , while @xmath345 for large @xmath188 .",
    "thus , from ( [ ac8 ] ) we deduce @xmath346 for large enough @xmath188 .",
    "further , @xmath347 using that @xmath348 .",
    "so @xmath349 substituting into ( [ ad1 ] ) , we get @xmath350 for large @xmath188 .",
    "we can choose @xmath271 small enough for the expression in brackets on the right - hand side to be positive .",
    "this gives @xmath351 which , since @xmath46 is assumed , implies @xmath352 a contradiction with ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "we can remove the continuity assumption as before .",
    "so ( [ 3.6as ] ) is proved when @xmath353 .",
    "now we will deal with the case when @xmath108 but @xmath73 .",

    "the working in case ( c ) is still valid from ( [ ac6 ] ) to ( [ ac9 ] ) .",
    "the negative jump process is now absent from @xmath18 and ( [ ac6 ] ) gives , with @xmath354 , @xmath355 using @xmath356 in the last inequality ( since @xmath262 is continuous ) .",
    "then choosing @xmath357 we get @xmath358 letting @xmath185 ( so @xmath62 and @xmath359 ) shows that @xmath360 . since @xmath18 has no negative jumps , from this we deduce that @xmath0 is of bounded variation with drift @xmath361 ( see doney and maller @xcite , theorem  2.1 and remark  1 ) , which is non - negative by ( [ ac9 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is a subordinator with non - negative drift .",
    "it follows that @xmath362 is non - negative for all @xmath17 .",
    "this is proved assuming continuity of @xmath278 but that assumption can be removed as before .",
    "then @xmath363 together with @xmath52 implies @xmath364 as @xmath233 by theorem  [ th3.3 ] , hence ( [ 3.7s ] ) .",

    "then we can choose @xmath365 such that @xmath366 as @xmath185 .",
    "following exactly the proof of part ( i ) , we get ( [ xot ] ) , and this implies @xmath66 , since @xmath367 .",
    "conversely , suppose @xmath66 as @xmath368 for a non - stochastic sequence @xmath62 .",
