    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model ( or a modified version of it ) is widely believed to describe the essential physics of the strongly correlated electrons in high temperature superconducting cuprates .",
    "@xcite unlike the 1d hubbard model , an exact solution of the 2d problem is not known , and one must resort to approximations . the validity of such approximations can be tested on the 1d hubbard model , which is exactly solvable@xcite using the bethe ansatz.@xcite it is highly desirable to develop an approximation which recaptures essential physical features of the exact bethe ansatz solution and which , at the same time , can be applied to higher dimensional systems . in this paper , we show that the configuration interaction ( ci ) method @xcite is such an approximation .",
    "we demonstrate that the ci method recaptures essential quantum tunneling effects that go beyond mean - field theory and that lead to spin - charge separation in 1d .",
    "the predictions of the ci method in the 2d case as well as a comparison to cuprate superconductors are described in detail elsewhere.@xcite    we consider the generalized hubbard hamiltonian : @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the creation operator for an electron of spin @xmath3 at site @xmath4 , and the notation @xmath5 means that the sum is restricted to nearest - neighbors sites @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "the parameters of the problem are the hopping matrix @xmath7 , the on - site interaction matrix @xmath8 , and the su(2 ) matrices @xmath9 , which describe phase factors and internal spin rotations acquired by the electron as it hops between sites . for the 1d hubbard hamiltonian which we consider in this paper we simply set @xmath10 .",
    "however , for the 2d system , it has been shown that a non - trivial choice of the matrices @xmath9 , which describes a @xmath11 ( internal ) spin rotation of the electron as it encircles an elementary plaquette of the square lattice , may be essential to the cuprate physics.@xcite for this reason , we develop the ci formalism for the more general hamiltonian ( [ 2.0 ] ) .",
    "in addition to providing a test to gauge the accuracy of the configuration interaction method , the 1d results may be directly relevant to certain high t@xmath12 cuprate superconductors . yba@xmath13cu@xmath14o@xmath15 and its close relatives have quasi - one - dimensional cuo chain structures .",
    "experiments measuring the dc resistivity @xcite , the infrared and optical conductivity @xcite and the penetration depth in untwinned crystals @xcite and ceramics @xcite have revealed large anisotropies between the a - direction ( perpendicular to chains ) and the b - direction ( parallel to chains ) .",
    "these results suggest that substantial currents are carried along the chains in both the normal and superconducting state .",
    "the source of superconducting condensate on the chains has not yet been elucidated .",
    "we begin section 2 with a brief review of the static hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) .",
    "the hfa leads to a mean - field ground - state with properties which are in disagreement with those of the exact ground - state .",
    "for the half - filled ( undoped ) chain , hfa predicts a degenerate ground - state with long - range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order and with staggered magnetic moments aligned along some arbitrary direction . even in the presence of a weak external interaction which creates an easy axis for spin orientation , the hf ground state is degenerate with the related mean - field in which all the spins have been flipped ( @xmath16 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the true ground - state of the half - filled system is non - degenerate and has no long - range order , despite the presence of strong afm correlations .",
    "when holes are introduced into the chain , the hfa leads to the creation of static magnetic spin - polaron and domain - wall solitons which trap the hole . since these solitons are motionless in the static hfa , this mean field solution breaks the translational invariance of the original hamiltonian .",
    "the ci method facilitates the restoration of both of the above symmetries in accord with the exact bethe ansatz ground state .",
    "the essence of the ci method is to use a linear combination of hf wavefunctions in order to restore the various broken symmetries of the mean - field theory . in a doped system , for instance",
    ", the ci wavefunction is chosen to be a linear combination of hf wavefunctions describing the charged soliton centered at various sites .",
    "besides restoring the translational symmetry , such a wavefunction also effectively takes into account the quantum dynamics of the charged soliton along the chain .",
    "this motion represents a large amplitude tunneling event between a given afm mean field and the alternative afm mean - field obtained by the operation ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "moreover , the propagating soliton lowers its quantum zero point energy considerably , relative to the static ( hfa ) soliton .    in section 3 we briefly review the exact bethe ansatz ( ba ) solution and the ground - state energies of the half - filled and doped chains .",
    "the comparison between the bethe ansatz , hartree - fock and configuration interaction solutions is presented in section 4 .",
    "for both the undoped chain , and the chain with one doping hole , we show that through the nucleation of mobile quantum solitons , the ci method provides a much better description than the hfa .",
    "we identify the charge carrier of the hubbard chain to be a charged bosonic domain - wall , and we show that its energy , in the ci method , is in excellent agreement with the ba result .",
    "the ci method leads to a simple , physical interpretation of spin - charge separation . adding a single hole to a chain leads to the creation of two magnetic solitons .",
    "one soliton is the bosonic charged domain wall ( which carries charge , but no spin ) , while the other soliton is the neutral spin-1/2 domain wall ( which carries spin , but no charge ) .",
    "the energy of these excitations are in good agreement with the ba results .",
    "finally , section 5 contains discussion of the results and conclusions .",
    "one of the most widely used approximations for the many - electron problem is the static hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) . in this approximation",
    "the many - body problem is reduced to one - electron problems in which each electron moves in a self - consistent manner depending on the mean - field potential of the other electrons in the system . while this method is insufficient , by itself , to capture all of the physics of low dimensional electronic systems with strong correlations , it provides a valuable starting point from which essential fluctuation corrections can be included . in particular",
    ", we use the hartree - fock method to establish the electronic structure and the static energies of various magnetic soliton structures . in the more general configuration interaction ( ci )",
    "variational wavefunction , the solitons acquire quantum dynamics and describe large amplitude tunneling and fluctuation effects that go beyond mean field theory .    in the hf approximation ,",
    "the many - body wavefunction @xmath17 is decomposed into a slater determinant of effective one - electron orbitals .",
    "the one - electron orbitals are found from the condition that the total energy of the system is minimized @xmath18    in order to approximate the ground state of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , we consider a slater determinant trial - wavefunction of the form @xmath19 is the vacuum state , @xmath20 is the total number of electrons in the system and the one - electron states are given by @xmath21 here , the one - particle wave - functions @xmath22 form a complete and orthonormal system .    using the wavefunction ( [ 2.3 ] ) in equation (",
    "[ 2.1 ] ) , and minimizing with respect to the one - particle wavefunctions @xmath22 , we obtain the hartree - fock eigen - equations :    where @xmath23 are the pauli spin matrices and the charge density , @xmath24 and the spin density , @xmath25 must be computed self - consistently .",
    "the notation @xmath26 appearing in ( [ 2.5 ] ) means that the sum is performed over the sites @xmath6 which are nearest - neighbors of the site @xmath4 .",
    "the self - consistent hartree - fock equations ( [ 2.5],[2.6],[2.7 ] ) must be satisfied by the occupied orbitals @xmath27 , but can also be used to compute the empty ( hole ) orbitals .",
    "the ground - state energy of the system in the hfa is given by @xmath28 where the single particle energies are obtained from ( [ 2.5 ] ) .",
    "the approximation scheme described so far is called the unrestricted hartree - fock approximation , because we did not impose constraints on the wavefunction @xmath17 which would require it to be an eigenfunction of various symmetry operations which commute with the hamiltonian ( [ 2.0 ] ) . if these symmetries are enforced , the method is called the restricted hartree - fock approximation .",
    "we use the unrestricted hfa since it leads to lower energies .",
    "the breaking of symmetries in our case implies that electronic correlations are more effectively taken into account .",
    "@xcite the restoration of these symmetries is deferred until the ci wavefunction is introduced .    in the undoped ( half - filled ) case",
    ", the self - consistent hartree - fock equations can be solved analytically for the infinite system , using plane - wave one - particle wave - functions . in the unrestricted hartree - fock approach ,",
    "doping the system leads to the appearance of inhomogeneous solutions , which break the translational invariance . in this case",
    ", we solve the unrestricted self - consistent hartree - fock equations numerically on a finite chain . starting with an initial spin and charge distribution @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ", we numerically solve the eigenproblem ( [ 2.5 ] ) and find the hf eigenenergies @xmath31 and wavefunctions @xmath32 .",
    "these are used in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) to calculate the new spin and charge distribution , and the procedure is repeated until self - consistency is reached .",
    "numerically , we define self - consistency by the condition that the largest variation of any of the charge or spin components on any of the sites of the lattice is less that @xmath33 between successive iterations .",
    "the basic idea of the configuration interaction ( ci ) method is that the ground - state wavefunction , for a system with @xmath20 electrons , is not just a @xmath34 slater determinant ( as in the hfa ) , but a judiciously chosen linear combination of such slater determinants . @xcite",
    "given the fact that the set of all possible slater determinants ( with all possible occupation numbers ) generated from a complete set of one - electron orbitals constitute a complete basis of the @xmath20-particle hilbert space , our aim is to pick out a subset of slater determinants which captures the essential physics of the exact solution .",

    "instead , we select the slater determinant basis @xmath42 from the set of broken symmetry , unrestricted hartree - fock wavefunctions ( [ 2.3 ] ) , their symmetry related partners and their excitations .",

    "since this unrestricted hf wavefunction is not translationally invariant ( the doping hole is always localized somewhere along the chain ) , we can restore the translational invariance of the ci ground - state wavefunction by also including in the basis of slater determinants all the possible lattice translations of this unrestricted hf wavefunction .",

    "( [ 3.8 ] ) ( shown as the full line ) .",
    "we consider chains with an even number of sites ( integer number of unit cells ) , since we know that the ground - state has afm correlations .",
    "similar curves are obtained for other values of @xmath0 .",
    "another well known case is that of a chain with just one hole , in the @xmath80 limit . in this limit",
    ", double occupancy is forbidden by the large on - site interaction , and the only possible charge fluctuation is the motion of the hole .",
    "the total energy of the chain reduces to the energy of the hole , since the single occupied sites give little contribution to energy ( in this limit the contributions from the afm correlations of the electron spins , of the order of @xmath81 , are negligible for finite chains ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show @xcite that the hole s dispersion relation in 1d is exactly that of a free particle , and therefore the total energy of the chain containing a single hole with momentum @xmath82 is @xmath83 . in the following sections , we show that the ground - state energy approaches @xmath84 as @xmath85 for the ci method as well as for the bethe ansatz equations of the chain with one hole .",
    "for the undoped system , the self - consistent hf equations ( [ 2.5],[2.6],[2.7 ] ) for an infinite system give rise to a mean - field ground state with long range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "however , the mermin - wagner theorem states that the true ground - state of any one dimensional isolated system can not have long range order ( lro ) and that lro is absent in 2d systems for non - zero temperatures . in the framework of the ci method , mobile solitons in the afm background",
    "mediate the destruction of lro .    using the spin and charge distributions @xmath86 ( one electron per site ) and @xmath87 ( afm order in the arbitrary direction @xmath88 ) , equation ( [ 2.5 ] ) yields two electronic bands characterized by the dispersion relations @xmath89\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the dispersion relation of non - interacting electrons and @xmath67 is the lattice constant .",
    "each of these levels is double - degenerate ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "given the symmetry of the spectrum and the fact that only half the states are occupied , one can easily see that in the hartree - fock ground state , all the states in the valence band @xmath92 are occupied , while all the states in the conduction band @xmath93 are empty .",
    "the two bands are separated by the usual mott - hubbard charge transfer gap opened at the fermi surface @xmath94 , of magnitude @xmath95 .    using the valence band wavefunctions in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) , we obtain @xcite the self - consistent spin amplitude @xmath96 where @xmath61 is the number of sites and the sum is performed over the brillouin zone @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "this equation has three solutions .",
    "one is trivial ( @xmath98 ) . for @xmath99",
    "the equation depends only on @xmath100 .",
    "consequently , _ the mean - field ground state is doubly - degenerate _ : both @xmath101 and @xmath102 satisfy eq .",
    "( [ 2.12 ] ) and give rise to self - consistent ground - states which differ from each other only through the fact that all the spins are flipped from one ground - state to the other one . strictly speaking",
    ", the hf solution gives an infinite number of degenerate ground states , because the direction @xmath88 is arbitrary ( this is a direct consequence of the fact that the hubbard model is rotationally invariant ) .",
    "however , since a real chain is embedded in a 3d crystal , crystal field interactions will lift the rotational degeneracy , and fix one particular direction of orientation ( easy axis ) for the spins ( for instance , along the chains ) .",
    "consequently one particular direction @xmath88 is favored , and the mean - field ground state is doubly degenerate .",
    "since all the states of the valence band are occupied , the energy of the hf ground state is simply given by : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is given by the self - consistency condition ( [ 2.12 ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of the ground state energy per site , in units of @xmath7 , is plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig2.2 ] ) as a function of @xmath0 ( the full line ) .",
    "the following features can be observed : in the @xmath105 limit ( noninteracting electrons ) , the energy of the ground state has , indeed , the expected value @xmath106 . in the strong interaction limit @xmath107 , the energy of the ground state goes to zero as expected ( since in this limit every site is single occupied and virtual hopping is suppressed ) . for comparison , the exact ground - state energy obtained from the bethe ansatz ( eq .",
    "( [ 3.8 ] ) ) is also shown ( dashed line ) .",
    "the asymptotic value of the hf energy is found to be given by @xmath108 .",
    "it is well known that in this limit , the hubbard model is equivalent to an afm heisenberg model,@xcite with a coupling constant @xmath109 , and that its true ground state energy per site is @xcite @xmath110 .",
    "this suggests that the hartree - fock method is a good starting point , from which to incorporate fluctuation corrections which lower the energy .",
    "the hf slater determinant of the undoped afm ground state is invariant to translations by @xmath111 ( afm order must be preserved ) .",
    "while it is possible to include in the ci set of slater determinants excited hf states of the undoped chain obtained by exciting electrons from the valence to the conduction band , it turns out that lower energy self - consistent hf configurations can be generated by breaking the translational symmetry of the undoped mean - field afm background .",
    "this is facilitated by considering excited states of the afm background which can accommodate charge carriers in localized states deep within the charge transfer gap rather than within the mott - hubbard bands .",
    "the lowest energy self - consistent excited state is the undoped ( neutral ) domain - wall , which describes tunneling from one mean - field ground - state to the other mean - field ground - state .",
    "since the afm order rotates by @xmath112 when crossing the domain wall , we consider either one domain wall on an odd - site chain , or a pair of domain walls on an even - site chain , in order to impose cyclic boundary conditions .",
    "fig.[fig3.10 ] depicts a typical self - consistent configuration containing two neutral domain walls , one centered between sites 10 and 11 , and one centered between sites 30 and 31 .",
    "the charge @xmath86 everywhere . near the domain wall",
    "the self - consistent spin magnitudes @xmath113 adjust such that each neutral domain wall carries a spin 1/2 ( with a projection in the same direction as its core spins ) , suggesting that this excitation is a neutral fermion .",
    "this is confirmed from the electronic structure shown in fig.[fig3.11 ] .",
    "we obtain self - consistent configurations containing two neutral domain - walls at all possible distances from each other , either having opposite orientations ( i.e. total chain spin 0 ) or same orientations ( total chain spin @xmath114 ) .",
    "since the afm ground state has total spin 0 and states with different total spin do not mix , we need only include in the set of ci slater determinants @xmath115 states of total spin zero , i.e. those having the neutral domain walls `` paired '' ( with opposite orientations ) .",
    "since all the possible configurations with two neutral domain - walls have very similar energies , they must all be included along with the afm undoped ground state in making up the variational trial wavefunction .",
    "we must also include both afm undoped mean - field ground - states in the ci set .",
    "this can be easily seen from fig.[fig3.10 ] , where half of the chain is in one afm ground state , and the other half is in the other ( flipped ) ground state .",
    "therefore , this state will have equal overlap with both afm ground states , although the afm ground - states themselves are orthogonal to each other . for an @xmath61-site chain ,",
    "the ci set contains a total of 2+n(n-2)/2 slater determinants , two being the undoped afm ground states , and the rest being the n-2 possible states with paired domain - walls at different distances from each other , each of which can be translated n/2 times along the chain .    the total ground - state energy found with the hf ( circles ) , ci ( squares ) and ba ( diamonds ) methods for chains of different lengths @xmath61 for @xmath79 and @xmath116 are shown in fig.[fig3.12 ] . for all three methods",
    "the total energy of the chain is proportional to the length of the chain .",
    "the addition of the configurations with a pair of neutral domain walls in the ci method improves the ground - state energy considerably .",
    "it is obvious , however , that as the length of the chain increases configurations with two , three , four and more pairs of neutral domain walls should be included in the ci set in order to arrive at a perfect agreement with the exact bethe ansatz solution .",
    "it is interesting to remark that even if only the configurations with one pair of neutral domain walls are included , the non - degenerate ci ground state is such that @xmath117 for any site @xmath4 of the chain , although the antiferromagnetic correlations remain very strong .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the ci set of slater determinants contains an equal number of states with the spin at the site @xmath4 up and down , so in average each spin expectation value is vanishing .",
    "thus , the ci wavefunction is much more successful in mimicking the properties of the exact ba ground - state .        if we numerically solve the hf equations ( [ 2.5],[2.6],[2.7 ] ) for a @xmath61-site chain with @xmath118 electrons , we find three types of charged self - consistent solutions : the spin - bag ( or spin - polaron ) ( fig.[fig2.3 ] ) , the charged domain - wall centered on site ( cos domain wall ) ( fig.[fig2.4 ] ) and the charged domain - wall centered between sites ( cbs domain wall ) ( fig.[fig2.5 ] ) .",
    "the spin - polaron is created by trapping the hole in a small ferromagnetic core , which only affects the lr afm order locally .",
    "the domain walls are topological excitations , since the afm order is rotated by @xmath112 as one goes through the domain wall .",
    "therefore , in order to impose cyclic boundary conditions , we must consider an odd - site chain ( or we may take an even - site chain and add two holes , leading to the appearance of a domain wall- anti - domain wall pair ) .",
    "the localization length of the hole decreases as @xmath0 increasing for all three excitations .",
    "the spin and charge at sites far from the distortion equal the undoped mean - field ground - state values .    the electronic spectra corresponding to the configurations shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2.3],[fig2.4 ] and [ fig2.5 ] are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2.6 ] and [ fig2.7 ] .",
    "first panel in fig .",
    "[ fig2.6 ] corresponds to the undoped ground state of a @xmath119 sites chain . as discussed before ,",
    "the electronic spectrum consists of two bands of @xmath119 states each .",
    "the valence band is completely filled , the conduction band is completely empty , and there is a large charge transfer gap between them .",
    "adding one hole on the same @xmath119 sites chain , and keeping the cyclic boundary conditions , leads to the appearance of the spin - bag shown in fig.[fig2.3 ] .",
    "its electronic structure is shown in the right panel of fig.[fig2.6 ] .",
    "there is a localized level ( @xmath120 ) well below the valence band , the valence band contains 38 states , there are 3 localized levels deep inside the mott - hubbard charge transfer gap , and finally the conduction band also has 38 levels . since there are @xmath121 electrons in the system , only the localized level below the valence band and the valence band states are occupied .",
    "since the valence band is spin paired ( having an even number of states ) , this means that the total spin of this excitation is 1/2 , associated with the spin of the electron on the localized level . the fact that the spin - bag carries a 1/2-spin is also easy to deduce from fig .",
    "[ fig2.3 ] , because of the small ferromagnetic core .",
    "thus , we conclude that the spin - bag is a charged fermion .",
    "the charged domain wall electronic structures are shown in fig . [ fig2.7 ] , with the cbs domain wall in the left panel , and the cos domain wall in the right panel . in this case",
    ", we study a chain with @xmath122 electrons and @xmath123 sites , so that we can impose cyclic boundary conditions again .",
    "we can see that in both cases there are 4 localized levels inside the mott - hubbard gap , @xmath122 occupied states in the valence band , and 38 states in the conduction band .",
    "the localized levels of the cos domain wall are degenerate .",
    "the degeneracy is lifted for the cbs domain wall , and the upper discrete level is pushed quite close to the lower edge of the conduction band .",
    "however , it is still a localized level ( this is easily checked by plotting its wavefunction ) . in both cases we have a fully spin - paired valence band , and therefore the total spin of these excitations is zero . since they carry the charge of the hole , the domain walls are charged bosons , in analogy to the charged solitons of polyacetylene .",
    "@xcite    in order to establish the relevance of these different charged spin configurations , we compare their excitation energies ( defined with respect to the undoped ( half - filled ) ground state ) as a function of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "( [ fig2.9 ] ) .",
    "as we can see , the domain walls are the low - energy excitations for @xmath124 , while the spin - polarons become the low - energy excitations for @xmath125 . as @xmath105 ,",
    "the core size of the domain - walls diverges roughly like @xmath126 . as a result , in this limit the cos and the cbs domain - walls are very extended objects which become indistinguishable and degenerate",
    "however , as @xmath0 increases the core becomes more and more localized , and the cbs domain - wall becomes energetically favorable relative to the cos domain - wall .",
    "however , this static hfa does not take into account the lowering of energy of these excitations due to translations along the chain . from the simple inspection of the spin distributions of the spin - bag and of the domain wall",
    ", we can easily deduce that while a domain wall can move freely along the chain , the spin - bag is rather immobile . moving the center of the domain wall by one site ( by interchanging",
    "the hole with the spin at the right or at the left ) necessitates only some rearrangement of the magnitude of the core spins , while their orientation is automatically correct .",
    "consequently , the domain wall lowers its energy by an amount of order @xmath7 through hopping along the chain .",
    "however , if a spin - bag moves only by one site , the translated spin must be flipped ( which would require the the total spin of the spin - bag to likewise flip ) . in order to conserve its spin",
    ", the spin - bag must tunnel to the second nearest neighbor .",
    "this is a second order process , and consequently the spin - bag lowers its energy only by an amount of order @xmath81 through motion . as we demonstrate below ,",
    "using the configuration interaction method , these qualitative arguments are valid .",
    "when soliton dynamics is incorporated , it is the charged bosonic domain wall that proves to be the relevant charged excitation of the hubbard model for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "consider a spin - polaron on a chain with @xmath127 sites ( the number of sites is even so that we can impose cyclic boundary conditions ) .",
    "using the ci method we evaluate the kinetic energy of the mobile , charged spin - bag .",
    "as suggested above , we only need to include in the set of slater determinants @xmath128 configurations translated by an even number of sites from the initial hf configuration .",
    "let @xmath129 be the hf determinants for the spin - polaron centered at an even and odd site , respectively , and let @xmath130 be the total spin operator in the @xmath131-direction .",
    "then , @xmath132 .",
    "since the hubbard hamiltonian commutes with @xmath133 , it follows that @xmath134 . from the ci equation ( [ 3.3 ] ) we conclude that there is no mixing between states with the spin - polaron on one sublattice and states with the ( opposite spin ) spin - polaron on the other sublattice .",
    "therefore , on a chain with @xmath127 sites we only need to mix @xmath61 slater determinants in order to obtain the spin - polaron ground - state within the ci method .",
    "if the initial self - consistent hf spin - polaron configuration @xmath135 is composed of the one - particle occupied orbitals @xmath136 , the one - particle orbitals of the state @xmath137 translated by @xmath138 will simply be chosen as @xmath139 ( cyclic boundary conditions are assumed ) . the overlap matrices",

    "the band corresponding to the spin - polaron on the other sublattice will have the same structure , but corresponds to spin - down states . in the end",
    "we recover the typical spin - degenerate band expected for fermions .    given the general form of the wavefunction , the dispersion relation of the spin - polaron follows from the expression @xmath149 in deriving the last equation , we used the symmetry properties of the matrices @xmath141 and @xmath140 , namely that the @xmath150 matrix element only depends on @xmath151 . strictly speaking , @xmath152 is the energy of the whole chain containing the spin - polaron and will strongly depend on the length of the chain .",
    "we extract the dispersion relation of the spin - polaron from a fit of the form @xmath153 here @xmath154 is interpreted as the ground - state energy per site of the undoped afm ( for a very long chain , most of the sites are unaffected by the presence of the single spin - polaron ) .",
    "we define @xmath155 as the dispersion relation of the spin - polaron itself . in other words ,",
    "the energy of the spin - polaron is defined as the difference between the energy of the chain with the spin - polaron , and that of an undoped chain .",

    "clearly , translation lowers the total energy of the spin - polaron , with the most stable state corresponding to @xmath157 .",

    "there are @xmath165 distinct cos domain wall configurations , and @xmath165 distinct cbs domain wall configurations .",
    "the reason for the factor 2 is that translation of a domain wall by @xmath164 sites takes it into a domain wall centered at the same site as in the initial configuration , but with all spins flipped , due to the @xmath112-difference in the afm ordering of the spins on the two sides of the domain wall .",
    "a second translation around the whole chain is necessary in order to regain the initial configuration . as a result",

    "( [ 3.19 ] ) . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig3.5 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig3.2 ] , it is immediately apparent that the dispersion band of the domain walls is much wider .",
    "in fact , the band of the cos domain wall extends up to @xmath189 ( not shown ) . comparing the bottom of the dispersion band to the static hf excitation energy of domain wall ( shown as a full line )",
    ", we see that translational motion lowers the energy of the domain wall by about @xmath7 ( as opposed to only @xmath190 when @xmath79 for a spin - polaron ) .",
    "while the bottom of the dispersion band is basically identical for both types of domain walls , the top is very different .",
    "excited states with energy @xmath191 require the incorporation of the excited state configurations of the single slater determinant ( from static hartree - fock ) in the ci set .",
    "clearly these excited state , static configurations have energies comparable to the moving domain wall at high energy parts of the dispersion curve .",
    "the most likely candidates are those configurations in which electrons from the top of the valence band are excited into the bound discrete levels .",
    "if only one such excitation takes place , the energy of the static configuration is raised by @xmath192 ( the difference between the energy of the level at the top of the valence band , and that of the first empty localized level ) . by mixing such configurations in the ci slater determinant set ,",
    "we obtain modifications to the upper part of the dispersion relation , while the bottom remains unchanged . since we are interested in the kinetic energy gained by the domain wall through translation ( @xmath193 region ) , we will neglect these higher - energy processes in what follows .",
    "a technical issue that emerges is the effect of mixing both the cos and the cbs domain wall configurations when calculating the ci wavefunction . while one might hope for an improvement in the overall energy for the mobile , charged soliton , this is not the case .",
    "the reason is that each set of configurations by itself generates basically the same ci wavefunctions @xmath194 at the bottom of the dispersion band rather than linearly independent ones .",
    "this can easily be seen numerically if we analyze the eigenvalues of the overlap matrix @xmath140 .",
    "suppose that @xmath195 is an eigenvalue of this matrix , and that @xmath196 is the corresponding eigenvector ( for simplicity , we use @xmath61 as the dimension of the overlap matrix ) .",
    "defining @xmath197 it is straightforward to show that @xmath198 . when we mix both sets of configurations together , we find many vanishing eigenvalues @xmath199 , which imply @xmath200 ( numerically , we use the singular value decomposition technique as a diagnostic for vanishing eigenvalues ) .",
    "this proves that there are redundant linearly dependent combinations in the set of slater determinants @xmath128 .",
    "we remove these linearly dependent states to find the ci ground - state . in particular , by mixing cos and cbs domain wall configurations , the resulting low - energy spectrum is the same as that found by using only the lower energy cbs domain wall configurations .",
    "the previous analysis gives us the lowest energy of a single hole ( charged domain wall soliton ) on the chain that can be obtained within the ci approximation . in comparing this energy to the one obtained from the exact bethe ansatz solution , it is not appropriate to directly compare the total chain energies . the reason , as already proved , is that there is a large contribution to these energies proportional to the number of sites in the chain , the proportionality constant being the undoped ground - state energy per site ( see eq .",
    "( [ 3.19 ] ) ) .",
    "the hfa gives a higher undoped energy per site than the exact ba energy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2.2 ] ) , and the ci approach does not improve it unless we also add states with pairs of uncharged domain - walls .",
    "our aim is to isolate the energy of the doping hole .",
    "therefore , we compare @xmath201 ( the lowest ci energy of the domain wall itself ) with the corresponding doping hole energy extracted from the bethe ansatz . this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3.6 ] . in order to find the doping hole energy from the bethe ansatz , we evaluate the exact ground - state energy of a chain with @xmath164 sites and @xmath127 electrons ( half @xmath202 of which have spin - down ) , for various values of @xmath61 .",
    "this set of energies is seen to be well fitted by an expression of the form @xmath203 , where @xmath154 is in excellent agreement with the ba ground - state value predicted by ( [ 3.8 ] ) . as in the ci approach",
    ", we identify @xmath204 with the energy of the hole .",
    "the ba energies of the hole , as a function of @xmath0 are shown as squares in fig .",

    "they indeed go to @xmath161 in the @xmath85 limit , as expected . in the @xmath105 limit",
    ", the energy of the doping hole is expected to go to zero , since in this @xmath205 limit the system is a metal .",
    "the ci domain - wall energies @xmath206 are shown as full circles in figure [ fig3.6 ] .",
    "the agreement with the bethe ansatz energy is striking . for @xmath207 , the fit ( [ 3.19 ] ) is excellent and the error bars on the domain wall energies are extremely small .",
    "however , as @xmath105 , the size of the domain wall increases significantly ( it is around 20 sites for @xmath208 ) and therefore extremely long chains need to be considered for a good fit .",
    "the two upper lines correspond to the static hf energies obtained for a self - consistent cbs domain wall ( triangle down ) and a cos domain wall ( triangle up ) .",
    "the diamonds show the ci results for the spin - polaron .",
    "clearly , the translational motion of the domain wall ( included in the ci approach ) drastically lowers its overall energy .",
    "the kinetic energy saved is of the order @xmath7 over most of the @xmath0 parameter range .",
    "the agreement between the domain - wall energy as calculated in the ci approach and the exact doping - hole energy as given by the bethe ansatz is quite remarkable , over the whole range of @xmath0 parameters .",
    "the only disagreement appears for @xmath209 , where the domain - walls become extremely delocalized and the numerical calculations are very difficult .",
    "the ci solution is not exact because the hf description neglects the presence of additional neutral domain - walls pairs in the afm background .",
    "while the addition of such pairs improves the accuracy of the ci method relative to the exact solution , it makes the calculation more cumbersome , due to the large increase in the number of possible configurations .",
    "when the contribution of this background is removed , the ci solution of a single charged domain wall moving around the chain agrees very well with the exact solution .",
    "this suggests that the renormalization of the charged domain wall energy by neutral domain wall pairs is relatively small .",
    "the agreement with the bethe ansatz is not limited to the bottom of the charged domain wall dispersion curve . in the large @xmath0 limit ,",
    "the domain - wall dispersion band is indeed given by @xmath210 , as required .",
    "@xcite for example , the dispersion relation for domain - wall corresponding to @xmath211 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3.8 ] . at such high @xmath0 values ,",
    "the typical energy of the configurations containing electrons excited on the mid - gap levels is of order @xmath212 .",
    "they do not influence the lowest domain wall band . as @xmath0 is decreased",
    ", these excited configurations simply modify the high energy part of the domain - wall dispersion relation .    in conclusion ,",
    "the mobile charged bosonic domain wall excitation is the relevant charged excitation of the 1d chain described by the hubbard model for all values @xmath0 .",
    "although the static charged spin - polaron has lower excitation energy than the static domain - wall for @xmath213 , when quantum dynamics is taken into consideration ( ci method ) the mobile charged domain wall turns out to be the lowest energy excitation .      a particularly striking effect can be recaptured in the ci method if one adds a hole to an even - site chain . in the hfa , this leads to the appearance of one spin - polaron , since a single charged domain wall is incompatible with the cyclic boundary conditions involving an even number of sites . in the ci method , this charged spin - polaron is unstable to dissociation into a pair of more mobile domain - wall solitons .",
    "in particular the charged spin - bag dissociates into a charged bosonic domain - wall and a neutral fermionic domain wall . the translational kinetic energy saved by the domain wall motion more than offsets the additional exchange energy cost in creating a pair of solitons from a single spin - polaron .",
    "we demonstrate this spin - charge separation effect using the set of all the possible configurations with a pair of a charged and a neutral domain walls in the ci method . again , since states with different spins do not mix , we need only keep configurations in which the uncharged domain wall has the same spin , either + 1/2 , or -1/2 . as in the undoped case , configurations with a pair of domain walls connect the two possible afm ground states .",
    "this leads to a considerable change in the background energy ( see fig.[fig3.12 ] ) . as a result , we define the energy of the doping hole , in this case , with respect to the ci energy of an undoped chain with a pair of neutral domain - walls .",
    "this allows us to properly account for the renormalization of the background energy of the chain by the pair of domain walls .",
    "physically , we interpret this in the following way .",
    "the true ground state of the undoped chain has a certain number of pairs of neutral domain walls .",
    "when the chain is doped , the doping hole is bound into one of the already existing neutral domain walls , transforming it into a charged bosonic domain wall .",
    "all the other pairs of neutral domain walls remain largely unaffected .",
    "the results of this analysis are plotted in fig.[fig3.11b ] .",
    "we use the bethe equations to calculate the ground - state energy of even - site chains with one doping hole .",
    "the ba excitation energy for the doping hole added to an even - site chain is shown as circles .",
    "the exact chain energy is found to be well fitted by @xmath214 , with @xmath61 being the even number of sites of the chain , and @xmath154 the undoped ground - state energy per site .",
    "since @xmath215 is the total energy of the undoped chain , we again identify @xmath216 as the energy of the doping hole .",
    "the energy of a charged domain wall - neutral domain wall pair , obtained using the ci method for even - site chains , is shown as squares . clearly , the ci method recaptures the physics as well as the energetics of the ba solution to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "even closer agreement can be achieved if configurations with more pairs of uncharged domain - walls are included in the ci basis set .",
    "this result provides a very clear illustration of the spin - charge separation phenomenon known to exist in the 1d hubbard model . upon doping ,",
    "the relevant charge excitation is not the quasiparticle excitation ( spin - polaron ) which carries both the spin and the charge of the doping hole , but rather a deconfined pair excitation consisting of a charged bosonic domain - wall ( carrying charge but no spin ) and a neutral fermionic domain - wall ( carrying spin but no charge ) .",
    "another interesting result of this analysis is that the excitation energy needed to add a hole to an even - site chain is different from that needed to add a hole to an odd - site chain ( see fig.[fig3.11b ] , circles and diamonds ) .",
    "such a difference would be irreconcilable if the excitation was a local quasiparticle , in which case different boundary conditions are expected to introduce variations of the order @xmath217 . however , in the presence of the charge - spin separation , there is a simple interpretation .",
    "a doped chain with an odd @xmath61 number of sites has an even @xmath118 number of electrons .",
    "its ground state has zero spin ( all electrons are paired ) .",
    "this is well described by a single charged domain - wall . on the other hand",
    ", the doped chain with an even @xmath61 number of sites has an odd @xmath118 number of electrons . in order to represent the total spin 1/2 of the unpaired electron ,",
    "it is necessary to include both a charged domain wall and a neutral spin-1/2 soliton .",
    "we associate the difference @xmath218 between the excitation energy of a single hole on odd and even - site chains with the energy of the additional neutral spin-1/2 soliton .",
    "this interpretation may be verified independently by evaluating the energy of a single neutral spin-1/2 domain wall on an odd - site , undoped chain .",
    "the ba ground - state energy of the undoped odd - site chain varies with the odd-@xmath61 number of sites as @xmath219 , where @xmath154 , the undoped ground - state energy per site , has the same value as obtained from fits of even - site chains .",
    "we identify @xmath220 as the energy of the neutral spin soliton .",
    "the energies @xmath220 and @xmath221 are compared in fig.[fig3.10b ] .",
    "the good agreement between these independent measures of energy confirms that the spin soliton is a well defined concept even in the presence of doping .",
    "the existence of the spin soliton accounts for the difference in energy between odd and even site chains even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it facilitates our identification of the spin soliton in the bethe ansatz with the neutral spin-1/2 domain wall of the ci approximation .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated the validity of the configuration interaction method as a technique for going beyond mean field theory in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the method recaptures the essential physical features as well as energetics of the exact solution of the 1d hubbard chain .",
    "the ci method provides a systematic way to improve and go beyond the hartree - fock approximation , by incorporating essential quantum dynamics and tunneling effects which are excluded from the mean - field theory .",
    "we showed that a charged bosonic domain wall can lower its kinetic energy by about @xmath7 for all @xmath0 values , while the immobile charged spin - polaron can only lower its kinetic energy by an energy of the order of @xmath81 .",
    "as a result , the mobile charged bosonic domain wall is the low energy charged excitation of the hubbard chain for all values of @xmath0 , and its excitation energy and dispersion band are in good agreement with the predictions of the exact bethe - ansatz solution .",
    "we also showed that it is energetically favorable for the ( quasiparticle - like ) charged fermionic spin - bag to dissociate into a charged bosonic domain wall ( which carries the charge but no spin ) and a neutral spin-1/2 domain wall ( which carries the spin but no charge ) .",
    "clearly the ci method recaptures the physics of spin - charge separation known to exist in the 1d hubbard model",
    ". it may be fruitful to perform a more detailed study of the interaction between various types of domain walls , both charged and uncharged .",
    "various correlation functions and response functions can also be calculated for detailed comparison with exact results .",
