    "the detection of the first fading afterglow from long gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) @xcite proved to be a pivotal moment in their study .",
    "similarly , the first identifications of short grb ( sgrb ) afterglows in 2005 opened a new window on this still enigmatic class of transient @xcite .",
    "afterglows provide precise positions , and hence a route to redshifts and identifying the host galaxies .",
    "this in turn provides luminosities and space densities for the bursts , allows possible means of measuring their collimation , and ultimately may enable  smoking \" gun signatures of their progenitors to be uncovered , as was the case for lgrbs @xcite .",
    "grbs can be categorised , largely according to their duration , as lgrbs and sgrbs , with the dividing line being at roughly 2s @xcite .",
    "lgrbs have been identified with starforming galaxies with moderately low metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) leading to the suggestion that young massive stars are the most likely progenitors ( collapsars , summarised in * ? ? ?",
    "studies of the locations of lgrbs with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) have shown that lgrbs typically occur in compact galaxies @xcite , with mean effective radii of 1.7 kpc , and in the brightest regions of their hosts @xcite .",
    "however , studies of sgrb host galaxies contrast with this picture .",
    "some hosts contain exclusively ancient populations @xcite , while others are actively star forming @xcite , or contain a mixture of young and older populations @xcite .",
    "additionally , the bursts themselves can be significantly offset from their hosts @xcite , a fact which can complicate the task of host identification @xcite .",
    "these observations imply that the progenitors of sgrbs can originate from ancient populations , which may well be kicked from their birthplace .",
    "the final mergers of compact object binaries remain a prime candidate @xcite . additionally , there is thought to be a separate population of sgrbs at redshifts @xmath3 which are associated with giant flares from extra - galactic soft gamma repeaters @xcite . at very low redshift",
    "there may be overlap between these , and a more energetic , cosmological population .    with the influx of grbs over the past few years ,",
    "it has become apparent that there are examples of sgrbs and lgrbs which have properties which make it hard to unambiguously assign them to one category or the other .",
    "for example grb 050724 , @xmath4 , occured in a nearby elliptical galaxy which , among other properties , associated it with the sgrb population @xcite .",
    "grb 060505 , @xmath5 , had no associated supernova but had a spectral lag which is consistent with the lgrb population , was located within a star formation region in a host galaxy at @xmath6 and its classification is still not firmly established @xcite .",
    "additionally , grb 060614 , @xmath7 , is thought to be a sgrb with extended emission as there was no associated supernova and the spectral lag was consistent with other sgrbs @xcite .",
    "recently , grb 090426 was identified as the most distant sgrb at a redshift of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thne et al . in prep ) .",
    "@xcite conclude from their observations that the simplest explanation is that the progenitor was more likely to be a collapsar . with this in mind",
    ", it is imperative that we understand the properties of host galaxies and , if possible , the local environment of grbs to aid in their classification and the identification of the progenitor .",
    "the majority of grbs lie at moderate to high redshift , and have host galaxies which are at best only marginally resolved from the ground .",
    "most sgrb redshifts to date come from the putative host galaxy and in some cases these may be ambiguous @xcite .",
    "grbs 060505 @xcite , 020819 @xcite and 980425 @xcite have been identified in nearby host galaxies , which has allowed more detailed spectroscopy . instead of relying on the properties of the galaxy as a whole",
    ", it has been possible to subdivide the galaxy into relevant regions and complete spatially resolved spectroscopy .",
    "this has allowed the study of the region in which the grb occured giving details about the local stellar population .    here , we present the discovery of the optical afterglow , and host galaxy of the short grb 080905a . its faint afterglow pinpointed its location to a spiral host galaxy at @xmath1 , the most local short burst yet known .",
    "sgrb 050709 has the next lowest confirmed redshift for a sgrb at @xmath10 @xcite , followed by sgrb 050724 associated with a host galaxy at @xmath11 @xcite .",

    "this is a relatively large offset , but is comparable to several other sgrb locations @xcite and it is important to note that the host galaxy is relatively large so the host - normalised offset would be much smaller .",

    "the 1.0 arcsecond wide slit was oriented along two different fixed position angles , illustrated in figure 3 , and @xmath49 second exposures were acquired for each slit position .",
    "the two slit positions ( -104.1 and -42.7 degrees ) were chosen to cut through the host galaxy covering the nucleus as well as spiral arms on either side of the galaxy ( hereafter `` slit position 1 '' ) , and to cover the afterglow position and cut through a nearby spiral arm ( hereafter `` slit position 2 '' ) .",

    "subapertures are 7 pixels in size in both slit position 1 and 2 data , which corresponds to 1.76 arcseconds per subaperture ( pixel scale is 0.252 arcseconds per pixel ) , i.e. a value matched to twice the seeing full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) . at the redshift of the host galaxy , this corresponds to a physical scale of 3.8 kpc per subaperture . in the following",

    "visual inspection of the images in r and k bands shows the host to be a nearly face - on galaxy , with clear bulge , disk and spiral arm components .",
    "at least two spiral arms can be distinguished , one on either side of the galaxy , which are hard to see due to a great number of foreground stars .",
    "figure 3 shows the spiral arms as observed in the r band and inset is an image of the central bulge in the k band .",
    "the detection of spiral arms in combination with the detected emission and absorption lines allows us to loosely classify the host of grb 080905a as an sb / c galaxy .    by subtracting foreground stars from the images we estimate that the host of grb 080905a has an r - band magnitude of r=@xmath55",
    "the large error arises not due to the faintness of the object , but due to the uncertainty in subtracting the significant number of foreground sources which overlap the spiral structure . correcting for foreground extinction ( @xmath56 ) this corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath57 , and suggests that the host of grb 080905a is broadly similar to the milky way .    using the near - infrared mass - light ratio , @xmath58 @xcite , and the k - band magnitude of the host galaxy , @xmath59 , we determine the mass of the host galaxy to be @xmath60 .",

    "the results from the spiral arm in slit position 2 tend to be in agreement with the northern spiral arm in slit position 1 .",

    "shortward of 4000   is the start of stellar photospheric opacity , which takes into account the mean temperature of the stars .",
    "hotter stars ( with shorter lifetimes ) have more ionised metals in their atmospheres , and hence a lower opacity , than cooler stars .",

    "we use the @xcite definition of the d4000 continua , which is less wide than the original definition by @xcite , and therefore less affected by dust reddening .",
    "the calculated values are plotted in figure 5 and provide a qualitative estimate of the relative ages of the stars as a function of position in the galaxy .",
    "the estimated error for d4000 ( calculated using the rms of the spectrum and the size of the bands ) for slit position 1 is @xmath200.12 and for slit position 2 is @xmath200.65 .",
    "as expected , it shows that the galactic centre hosts an older population of stars than the spiral arms .",
    "interestingly , it also appears that the northern spiral arm hosts an older population of stars than the southern spiral arm .",
    "this reinforces the evidence of active star formation occuring within the southern spiral arm and not in the northern spiral arm . due to large errors , it was not possible to calculate d4000 at the grb location .    using the approximate metallicity of this galaxy , log(o",
    "/ h)+12@xmath458.6 from log(n2 ) , and the mass - metallicity relation as measured by @xcite using galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey , we can estimate the mass of the galaxy to be @xmath72 m@xmath71 .",
    "this is consistent with the value calculated using the near - infrared mass - light ratio .",
    "in previous spatially resolved studies of low redshift grb host galaxies , it has been determined that lgrbs are associated with regions of active star formation and hence provides support for the core collapse supernova progenitor theory , for example lgrb 980425 and lgrb 060218 @xcite .",
    "additionally , lgrbs at higher redshifts tend to occur in the brightest regions of the host galaxy @xcite and relatively small host galaxies @xcite .",
    "grb 080905a is in direct contrast to these results , occuring on the opposite side of a relatively large spiral galaxy to the most active star formation region and significantly offset from the centre , so its progenitor is unlikely to be a massive star .",
    "the properties of this specific region of the host galaxy is in agreement with the findings of @xcite for typical sgrb environments .",
    "one of the theoretically predicted progenitors of sgrbs is the merger of a compact binary , for example two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole .",
    "compact binaries are expected to be given a kick velocity during their formation which can allow them to travel large distances from their birthplace ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these events are expected to be associated with an older stellar population and offset from the host galaxy , as observed for grb 080905a .",
    "to summarize , grb 080905a has short , hard prompt emission with properties expected for a compact binary merger progenitor .",
    "there was no associated supernova , it appears to be a low density environment and had a low luminosity .",
    "the host galaxy is a spiral galaxy with active star formation , but grb 080905a occured close to a spiral arm , dominated by a relatively old population , and on the opposite side of the galaxy from the spiral arm with most active star formation .",
    "additionally , it was offset from the centre of the host galaxy by a projected radial distance of 18.5 kpc .",
    "therefore , our observations have shown that grb 080905a is unambigously a short population grb , whose properties suggest that the progenitor is likely to be a compact binary merger .",
    "in this paper , we have presented spatially resolved spectroscopy of the host galaxy of the short hard grb 080905a , with a t@xmath19 of 1 s. the prompt emission had an isotropic total energy of @xmath73erg in the energy band 15 - 150 kev . the x - ray and optical afterglows",
    "were observed , and the optical afterglow had a magnitude of @xmath4524 at 8.5 hours after the burst fading to @xmath4125 at 32 hours .",
    "the host is an almost face on spiral galaxy ( inclination @xmath4523@xmath74 ) with a central bulge and at least 2 spiral arms , it is loosely classified as a sb / c galaxy .",
    "the probability that grb 080905a was chance aligned with this galaxy is @xmath75% .",
    "the observed redshift of this galaxy is @xmath76 , the lowest definite redshift for a typical sgrb thought to originate from a compact binary merger .",
    "using spatially resolved spectroscopy , we identify a disparity between the two spiral arms , with the southern arm showing a younger stellar population and more active star formation than the northern spiral arm .",
    "we are unable to be more specific as we are using a relative flux callibration , not absolute fluxes , due to the contamination from overlying stars and we are not observing the entire host galaxy .    the optical afterglow is observed to be offset from the centre of the galaxy by the projected radial distance of 18.5 kpc and occurs in the northern region .",
    "this offset and the association with an older population in the northern spiral arm , in addition to the prompt emission properties , shows that grb 080905a would fit in the type i gold sample grb as defined by @xcite with the progenitor being a compact binary merger .",
