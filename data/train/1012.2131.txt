    "several authors have studied the variation of @xmath13 as a function of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "numerical evidence that the entropy @xmath13 is continuous but non - monotone was first produced in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite found out that the entropy is monotone over intervals in parameter space for which the orbits of the two endpoints collide after a finite number of steps ( see equation on page ) .",
    "this analysis is completed in @xcite , where intervals of parameters for which such relation holds are classified , and it is proven that the union of all such intervals has full measure .",
    "the complementary set , denoted by @xmath14 , is the set of parameters across which the combinatorics of @xmath1 changes , hence it will be called the _",
    "bifurcation set_.    the second object we consider is the family of _ unimodal maps _ , i.e. smooth maps of the interval with only one critical point , the most famous example being the logistic family .",
    "to any such map one can associate a _ kneading invariant _",
    "@xcite which encodes the dynamics of the critical point and determines the combinatorial type of the map .",
    "using an appropriate coding ( see @xcite , @xcite ) the set of all kneading invariants which arise from unimodal maps can be represented as the points of a set @xmath15 defined in terms of the _ tent map _ @xmath16    @xmath17 : t^k(x ) \\leq x \\ \\forall",
    "k \\in \\mathbb{n } \\}\\ ] ]    the set @xmath15 is uncountable , totally disconnected and closed ; the topology of @xmath15 reflects the variation in the dynamics of the corresponding maps as the parameter varies : for instance families of isolated points in @xmath15 correspond to period doubling cascades ( see section [ pedou ] ) .",
    "this set also parametrizes the real slice of the boundary of the mandelbrot set @xmath18 ( see section [ mandel ] ) , because for each admissible kneading sequence there exists exactly one real parameter on the boundary with that kneading sequence .",
    "the key result of this paper ( section [ main ] ) is the following correspondence between the bifurcation parameters of the two families :    [ mth ] the sets @xmath19 and @xmath20 are homeomorphic .",
    "more precisely , the map @xmath21 \\rightarrow [ \\frac{1}{2},1]$ ] given by @xmath22 is an orientation - reversing homeomorphism which takes @xmath20 onto @xmath23 .    as a consequence , intervals in the parameter space of @xmath0-continued fractions where a matching between the orbits of the endpoints occurs are in one - to - one correspondence with real hyperbolic components of the mandelbrot set , i.e. intervals in the parameter space of real quadratic polynomials where the orbit of the critical point is attracted to a periodic cycle . in terms of entropy , intervals",
    "over which the metric entropy of @xmath0-continued fractions is monotone ( and conjecturally smooth ) are mapped to parameter intervals in the space of quadratic polynomials where the topological entropy is constant ( see figure [ nakadavsmandelbrot ] ) .",
    "for instance , the matching interval @xmath24 , [ 0 ; \\overline{2 , 1}])$ ] , identified in @xcite and @xcite , corresponds to the `` airplane component '' of period @xmath25 in the mandelbrot set .",
    "this dictionary illuminates many connections between seemingly unrelated objects in real dynamics , complex dynamics , and arithmetic , which we will explore in the rest of the paper .",
    "for example , the following properties of @xmath15 follow immediately by using the combinatorial tools developed in @xcite :    1 .",
    "the set @xmath15 can be constructed via a bisection algorithm ( section [ bisec ] ) 2 .",
    "the sequences of isolated points in @xmath20 observed experimentally in ( @xcite , section 4.2 ) are the images of the well - known period doubling cascades for unimodal maps ( section [ pedou ] ) 3 .",
    "the derived set @xmath26 is a cantor set ( section [ top ] ) 4 .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of @xmath15 is @xmath27 ( section [ hd ] )    [ nakadavsmandelbrot ]     from the above properties of @xmath15 we derive some consequences on corresponding sets .",
    "for example , ( iv ) implies that the set of external rays of the mandelbrot set which land on the real axis has full hausdorff dimension ( section [ mandel ] ) , a result first obtained in @xcite .",
    "moreover , in section [ univ ] we give an arithmetic interpretation of @xmath15 .",
    "namely , aperiodic elements of @xmath15 correspond to binary expansions of _ univoque numbers _ , i.e. the numbers @xmath28 such that @xmath27 admits a unique representation in base @xmath29 .",
    "univoque numbers have been studied by erds , horvth and jo @xcite and many others ( see section [ univ ] for references ) , and once again the translation of statements ( i)-(iv ) immediately yields several results previously obtained by different authors .",
    "0.3 cm    moreover , our new characterization of the set @xmath14 ( see lemma [ characterizee ] ) shows that it is essentially the same object appearing in a paper of cassaigne as the spectrum of recurrence quotients for cutting sequences of geodesics on the torus ( @xcite , theorem 1.1 ) .",
    "indeed , our results on @xmath14 answer some questions raised in @xcite , such as the computation of hausdorff dimension .    finally , we would like to emphasize that the correspondence of theorem [ mth ] opens up many questions , and it is especially natural to ask to what extent results in the well - developed theory of unimodal maps can be translated into the continued fraction setting .",
    "for instance , it would be interesting to identify an analogue of renormalization for the @xmath0-continued fractions , and to further explore the relation between the entropy of that family ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the topological entropy of unimodal maps ( @xcite and @xcite among others ) .",
