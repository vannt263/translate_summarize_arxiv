    "synchronization phenomena play an important role in nearly all fields of science , including physics , chemistry , economy , and the neurosciences  @xcite .",
    "the human epileptic brain can be regarded as a prominent example in which different forms of synchronization can be observed .",

    "recent studies have shown that the approach of analyzing the dynamics of interacting complex systems with the nonlinear dynamics of interacting nonlinear elements can also be extended to the concepts of phase synchronization@xcite and generalized synchronization@xcite . with the latter concept symmetric and asymmetric nonlinear interdependence measures",
