    "soon after henri becquerel discovered the radioactivity of uranium in 1896 @xcite , many nuclear physicists started to pay attention to the beta decays @xmath0 , in which the energy spectrum of electrons was expected to be _ discrete _ thanks to the laws of energy and momentum conservations .",
    "however , james chadwick observed a _ continuous _ electron energy spectrum of the beta decay in 1914 @xcite , and such a result was firmly confirmed by charles ellis and his colleagues in the 1920s @xcite . at that time",
    "there were two different ideas to resolve this  new physics \" phenomenon ( i.e. , the discrepancy between _ observed _ and _ expected _ energy spectra of electrons ) : one was to give up the energy conservation law and the other was to add in a new particle .",
    "niels bohr was the representative of the former idea , which turned out to be wrong . wolfgang pauli conjectured that an unobservable , light , spin-1/2 and neutral particle  known as the electron antineutrino later  appeared in the beta decay and carried away some energy and momentum , and thus the energy spectrum of electrons in the process @xmath1 was continuous .",
    "pauli first put forward the concept of neutrinos in his famous letter to the  dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen \" who had gathered in t@xmath2bingen on 4 december 1930 @xcite .",
    "three years later he gave a talk on his neutrino hypothesis in the renowned solvay conference , where enrico fermi was in the audience and took this hypothesis seriously .",
    "in the end of 1933 , fermi published his most important theoretical work  an effective theory of the beta decay @xcite , which is actually a low - energy version of today s standard picture of weak charged - current interactions .",
    "fermi s seminal work made it possible to calculate the reaction rates of nucleons and electrons ( or positrons ) interacting with neutrinos ( or antineutrinos ) .    in 1936 , hans bethe pointed out that an inverse beta decay mode of the type @xmath3 ( or more general , @xmath4 ) could be a possible way to verify the existence of electron antineutrinos produced from either fission bombs or fission reactors @xcite .",
    "this preliminary idea was elaborated by bruno pontecorvo in 1946 @xcite , and it became feasible with the development of the liquid scintillation counting techniques in the 1950s .",
    "although the incident @xmath5 is invisible , it can trigger the inverse beta decay where the emitted positron annihilates with an electron and the daughter nucleus is captured in the detector . both events are observable because they emit gamma rays , and the corresponding flashes in the liquid scintillator are separated by some microseconds .",
    "frederick reines and clyde cowan did the first reactor antineutrino experiment and obtained a positive result in 1956 @xcite , and they reported a new result consistent with the parity - violating theory of weak interactions in 1960 .",
    "the nobel prize finally came to reines in 1995 , when cowan had passed away 21 years before .",
    "the discovery of electron antineutrinos motivated pontecorvo to speculate on the possibility of lepton number violation and neutrino - antineutrino transitions in 1957 @xcite .",
    "his argument was actually based on a striking conjecture made by ettore majorana in 1937 : a massive neutrino could be its own antiparticle @xcite .    in 1962 ,",
    "the muon neutrino  a sister of the electron neutrino  was discovered by leon lederman , melvin schwartz and jack steinberger in an accelerator - based experiment @xcite .",
    "this discovery , which immediately motivated ziro maki , masami nakagawa and shoichi sakata to conjecture the @xmath6 conversion @xcite , was also recognized by the nobel prize in 1988 .",
    "the tau neutrino , another sister of the electron neutrino , was finally observed at the fermilab in the end of 2000 @xcite . within the standard model the complete lepton family consists of three charged members ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and three neutral members ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , and their corresponding antiparticles .",
    "neutrinos and antineutrinos may originate from many physical and astrophysical processes via weak interactions .",
    "1 illustrates some typical examples of neutrino or antineutrino sources in the universe .     scattering associated with different sources are also shown for comparison , where the peak around @xmath13 pev is related to the glashow resonance @xcite.,width=434 ]    _ example ( 1 ) _ : neutrinos and antineutrinos from the big bang .",
    "the standard cosmology predicts the existence of a cosmic neutrino ( or antineutrino ) background in the universe . today",
    "such _ relic _ neutrinos and antineutrinos should have an overall number density around @xmath14 , but their temperature is so low ( only about @xmath15 k , or roughly @xmath16 ev ) that there is no way to detect them . in the long run it might be possible to capture the relic electron neutrinos on some beta - decaying nuclei @xcite , as the ptolemy project is trying @xcite .",
    "_ example ( 2 ) _ : electron antineutrinos from the earth . since its birth",
    ", the earth s interior has kept a number of radioactive nuclei ( e.g. , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "that is why numerous electron antineutrinos can be produced from terrestrial  natural radioactivity \" ( i.e. , the beta decays ) , at a rate of several millions per square centimeter per second .",
    "so far such interesting geo-@xmath5 events have been observed at the @xmath20 level in the kamland @xcite and borexino @xcite experiments .",
    "_ example ( 3 ) _ : electron neutrinos from the sun .",
    "solar electron neutrinos come along with a number of thermonuclear fusion reactions inside the sun .",
    "one may understand why the sun shines with the help of @xmath21 : about @xmath22 of the energy radiates in the form of light and only @xmath23 of the energy is taken away by neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the only way to verify such a picture on the earth is to detect the electron neutrinos emitted from the core of the sun . in 1968",
    "solar neutrinos were first observed by raymond davis in his radiochemical experiment ( see section 4.1 for a more detailed description ) @xcite .    _ example ( 4 )",
    "_ : neutrinos and antineutrinos from supernovae .",
    "the explosion of a supernova may release the gravitational binding energy of @xmath24 erg in the form of neutrinos and antineutrinos @xcite .",
    "on 23 february 1987 the @xmath10 and @xmath5 events from the supernova 1987a explosion were observed by the kamiokande - ii @xcite , imb @xcite and baksan @xcite detectors .",
    "this observation was a great milestone in neutrino astronomy .",
    "davis and masatoshi koshiba received the nobel prize in 2002 for their pioneering detections of solar and supernova neutrinos , respectively .",
    "_ example ( 5 ) _ : neutrinos and antineutrinos from the earth s atmosphere .",
    "when a cosmic ray ( which is mainly composed of high - energy protons coming from somewhere in the galactic or extragalactic space ) penetrates the atmosphere around the earth , it may interact with the ambient nuclei and generate a particle shower containing charged pions and muons .",
    "the decays of @xmath25 and @xmath26 can therefore produce atmospheric @xmath11 , @xmath27 , @xmath10 and @xmath5 events , which have been observed in several experiments @xcite .",
    "in particular , the phenomenon of atmospheric neutrino oscillations was firmly established by the super - kamiokande ( sk ) collaboration in 1998 @xcite .",
    "_ example ( 6 ) _ : ultrahigh - energy ( uhe ) cosmic neutrinos and antineutrinos from distant astrophysical sources , including the expected active galactic nuclei , gamma ray bursts , supernova remnants and the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin cutoff of cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the uhe @xmath11 , @xmath27 , @xmath10 and @xmath5 events can be produced from uhe @xmath28 or @xmath29 collisions via @xmath25 and @xmath26 decays , and thus they may serve as a unique cosmic messenger and provide us with useful information about the cosmos that can not be extracted from the measurements of cosmic rays and gamma rays .",
    "so far the icecube detector at the south pole has observed 37 extraterrestrial neutrino candidate events with deposited energies ranging from 30 tev to 2 pev @xcite . among them , the three pev events represent the highest - energy neutrino interactions ever observed , but their astrophysical origin remains mysterious .",
    "of course , neutrinos and ( or ) antineutrinos can also be produced from some man - made facilities , especially the nuclear reactors and particle accelerators .",
    "they also play a crucial role in discovering neutrinos , observing flavor oscillations and measuring fundamental parameters , as one will see in sections 35 .",
    "as an important part of the matter content in the standard electroweak model based on the @xmath30 gauge group , neutrinos are assumed to be the _ massless _ weyl particles .",
    "hence only the left - handed neutrinos and right - handed antineutrinos exist , and they take part in weak charged- and neutral - current interactions via @xmath31 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "( 1 ) allows one to calculate the cross sections of neutrino - electron , neutrino - neutrino and neutrino - nucleon scattering processes @xcite .",
    "note that the reactions @xmath33 and @xmath34 can happen via both charged- and neutral - current interactions , but @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 ) can only occur via the neutral - current interactions .",
    "that is why the behavior of neutrino flavor conversion in a dense medium may be modified by the coherent forward @xmath39 or @xmath40 scattering .",
    "this effect is referred to as the wolfenstein - mikheyev - smirnov ( msw ) matter effect @xcite .",
    "the simplest quasi - elastic neutrino - nucleon scattering processes are the inverse beta decays @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which take place via the charged - current weak interactions .",
    "their cross sections can be approximately expressed as @xmath43 . in comparison ,",
    "the elastic neutrino - nucleon scattering reaction @xmath44 ( for @xmath32 ) is mediated by the neutral - current weak interactions .",
    "historically , the existence of weak neutral currents was first established in the gargamelle bubble chamber at cern in 1973 @xcite .",
    "this experiment , which observed the highly expected events of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , crowned the long - range neutrino program initiated by cern at that time and brought cern a leading role in the field of high energy physics .",
    "it also provided an unprecedentedly strong support to the standard electroweak model formulated by sheldon glashow , steven weinberg and abdus salam in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "these three theorists received the nobel prize in 1979 for their contributions to the electroweak theory and especially for their prediction of the weak neutral current .",
    "four years later , the three mediators of the weak force ( i.e. , the @xmath47 and @xmath48 bosons ) were finally discovered by carlo rubbia and his colleagues at cern @xcite .",
    "the standard model was thoroughly tested in the 1990s with the help of the large electron - positron collider ( lep ) running on the @xmath48 resonance at cern .",
    "in particular , the number of neutrino species was determined to be @xmath49 via the decay @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "such a result is consistent very well with 3 as required in the theory .",
    "extra light neutrino species are not impossible , but they must be  sterile \"  in the sense that they do not directly take part in the standard weak interactions , and hence their existence is not subject to the lep measurement .",
    "note that the structure of the standard model itself is too economical to allow the neutrinos to be massive . on the one hand ,",
    "the particle content of the model is so limited that there are neither right - handed neutrinos nor any higgs triplets .",
    "hence a normal dirac neutrino mass term is not allowed , nor a gauge - invariant majorana mass term . on the other hand ,",
    "the model is a renormalizable quantum field theory .",
    "the renormalizability implies that an effective dimension-5 operator , which can give each neutrino a majorana mass , is also forbidden .",
    "there are several ways to slightly extend the standard theory such that the neutrinos can acquire their masses with little influence on the great success of the theory itself @xcite . here",
    "let us take two typical examples for illustration .",
    "\\(1 ) if the renormalizability of the standard theory is relaxed , then the lowest - dimension operator that violates lepton number and generates neutrino masses must be the unique dimension-5 weinberg operator @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the cut - off energy scale in such an effective field theory , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the higgs and lepton doublets , respectively @xcite .",
    "after spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , this operator yields the neutrino masses @xmath55 ( for @xmath56 ) , which can be sufficiently small ( @xmath57 ev ) provided @xmath58 gev and @xmath59 gev . in this sense",
    "the study of neutrino mass generation can serve as a striking low - energy window onto new physics at superhigh energy scales .",
    "\\(2 ) if two or more heavy right - handed neutrinos are added into the standard theory and lepton number is violated by their majorana mass term , then the lagrangian responsible for neutrino masses can be written as @xmath60 in which the first term stands for the neutrino yukawa interactions , and the second term is lepton - number - violating .",
    "after the @xmath61 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath62 , one is left with the effective majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath63 , which is often referred to as the canonical _ seesaw _ formula @xcite . because @xmath64 is the @xmath65 singlet ,",
    "the mass scale of @xmath66 can be greatly higher than the electroweak scale @xmath67 .",
    "hence the mass scale of @xmath68 is highly suppressed , providing a natural explanation of the smallness of neutrino masses .    instead of introducing the heavy right - handed neutrinos , one",
    "may also introduce a higgs triplet or a few triplet fermions into the standard theory so as to explain why the three active neutrinos should have naturally small masses @xcite .",
    "such seesaw mechanisms essentially have the same spirit , which attributes the smallness of neutrino masses to the largeness of new degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , they require massive neutrinos to be the majorana particles and thus allow some lepton - number - violating processes to happen .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a pure dirac neutrino mass term , originating from the neutrino yukawa interactions on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , is less convincing and less interesting from a theoretical point of view .",
    "the reason for this argument is two - fold : ( a ) such a scenario can not explain why the neutrino masses are so small as compared with the charged lepton masses ; ( b ) given @xmath64 , the lepton - number - violating term @xmath69 should not be absent because it is not forbidden by gauge symmetry and lorentz invariance .",
    "if massive neutrinos really have the majorana nature , they can trigger the neutrinoless double - beta ( @xmath70 ) decays and some other lepton - number - violating processes .",
    "in particular , they are likely to have something to do with the observed asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the universe via the seesaw and leptogenesis @xcite mechanisms .",
    "hence the phenomenology of majorana neutrinos is much richer and more interesting than that of dirac neutrinos .",
    "although a massive neutrino does not possess any electric charge , it can have electromagnetic interactions via quantum loops @xcite .",
    "now that dirac and majorana neutrinos couple to the photon in different ways , their corresponding electromagnetic form factors must be different . given the standard weak interactions , one finds that a massive dirac neutrino has no electric dipole moment and its magnetic dipole moment is finite but extremely small : @xmath71 with @xmath72 being the bohr magneton .",
    "in contrast , a massive majorana neutrino has neither electric nor magnetic dipole moments , simply because its antiparticle is just itself .",
    "but both dirac and majorana neutrinos can have the _ transition _ dipole moments ( i.e. , from one mass eigenstate to another mass eigenstate ) , which may result in neutrino decays , neutrino - electron scattering , neutrino interactions with external magnetic fields , etc @xcite . in a realistic neutrino - electron scattering experiment",
    ", what can be constrained is actually an effective transition dipole moment @xmath73 consisting of both electric and magnetic components .",
    "hence it is practically impossible to distinguish between dirac and majorana neutrinos in such measurements .",
    "current experimental upper bounds on @xmath74 are at the level of @xmath75 @xcite , far above the afore - mentioned theoretical expectation @xmath76 .      in the basis where the flavor eigenstates of three charged leptons are identified with their mass eigenstates , one may diagonalize the majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath68 by means of a unitary transformation .",
    "then the leptonic charged - current interactions in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be reexpressed in terms of the mass eigenstates : @xmath77 where the @xmath78 unitary matrix @xmath79 describes the strength of lepton flavor mixing and can be parameterized by using three rotation angles and three cp - violating phases : @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 ( for @xmath83 ) , @xmath84 is referred to as the dirac cp - violating phase , and @xmath85 contains two extra phase parameters of the majorana nature .",
    "the matrix @xmath79 is often called the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix , and its unitarity has been tested at the percent level @xcite . is unitary or not depends on the mechanism of neutrino mass generation . in the canonical seesaw mechanism @xcite , for instance , the mixing between light and heavy majorana neutrinos may lead to tiny unitarity - violating effects for the pmns matrix @xmath79 itself . ]",
    "( 3 ) tells us that a @xmath86 neutrino can be produced from the @xmath87 interaction , and a @xmath88 neutrino can be detected through the @xmath89 interaction ( for @xmath90 )",
    ". the @xmath91 oscillation may happen if the @xmath92 beam with energy @xmath93 travels a proper distance @xmath94 in vacuum .",
    "the probability of such a flavor oscillation is given by @xcite @xmath95 in which @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( for @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "the probability of the @xmath100 oscillation can easily be read off from eq .",
    "( 5 ) by making the replacement @xmath101 .",
    "there are two types of neutrino oscillation experiments : the  appearance \" one ( @xmath102 ) and the  disappearance \" one ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "both solar neutrino oscillations ( @xmath104 ) and reactor antineutrino oscillations ( @xmath105 ) are of the disappearance type .",
    "the atmospheric muon - neutrino ( or muon - antineutrino ) oscillations essentially belong to the disappearance type , and the accelerator neutrino oscillations can be of either type .    at this point",
    "let us explain why it is extremely difficult to do a realistic neutrino - antineutrino oscillation experiment .",
    "we consider an @xmath106 beam produced from the standard charged - current interactions @xmath107 . after traveling a distance @xmath94 this beam",
    "will be detected at a detector through the standard charged - current interactions @xmath108 .",
    "different from the normal @xmath91 or @xmath109 oscillations , the @xmath110 oscillation involves a suppression factor @xmath111 in its amplitude .",
    "this factor reflects the fact that the incoming @xmath112 leads to an antineutrino @xmath106 in a dominantly right - handed helicity state , whereas the standard charged - current interactions that produce the outgoing @xmath113 would prefer the incident neutrino @xmath88 being in a left - handed state @xcite . because of @xmath114 ev and @xmath115 mev in a realistic experiment , this helicity suppression factor ( i.e. , @xmath116 ) makes it impossible to observe the phenomenon of neutrino - antineutrino oscillations",
    "in 1946 pontecorvo put forward a radiochemical technique which can be used to measure solar electron neutrinos via the reaction @xmath117 @xcite . the incident neutrino s energy threshold for this reaction to happen is @xmath118 mev , low enough to make it sensitive to solar @xmath119 neutrinos . in 1964",
    "john bahcall carefully calculated the solar neutrino flux and the capture rate of @xmath119 neutrinos , demonstrating the experimental feasibility of pontecorvo s idea @xcite .",
    "this motivated davis to build a @xmath120-gallon chlorine - argon neutrino detector in the homestake gold mine in the middle of the 1960s .",
    "the final result of this experiment was published in 1968 and caused a big puzzle : the measured flux of solar @xmath121 neutrinos was only about one third of the value predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite .",
    "such a deficit was later confirmed in a number of solar neutrino experiments , including the homestake @xcite , gallex / gno @xcite , sage @xcite , sk @xcite and sno @xcite experiments . among them , the sno experiment was especially crucial because it model - independently demonstrated the flavor conversion of solar @xmath10 neutrinos into @xmath11 and @xmath12 neutrinos .",
    "flux versus the @xmath10 flux determined from the sno data . the total solar @xmath119 neutrino flux predicted by the ssm",
    "is shown as dashed lines , parallel to the nc measurement .",
    "the narrowed band parallel to the sno s es measurement corresponds to the sk s es result .",
    "the best - fit point is obtained by using only the sno data @xcite.,width=472 ]    given heavy water as the target material of the sno detector , the solar @xmath119 neutrinos were measured via the charged - current ( cc ) reaction @xmath122 , the neutral - current ( nc ) reaction @xmath123 and the elastic - scattering process @xmath124 ( for @xmath125 ) @xcite .",
    "the observed neutrino fluxes in these three different channels are expected to satisfy @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , where @xmath129 denotes a sum of the fluxes of @xmath11 and @xmath12 neutrinos .",
    "so @xmath130 would hold if there were no flavor conversion ( i.e. , @xmath131 ) .",
    "the sno data @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 @xcite definitely demonstrated @xmath135 .",
    "now we are sure that the deficit of solar @xmath119 neutrinos , whose typical energies are about 6 mev to 7 mev , is due to @xmath136 and @xmath137 oscillations modified by significant msw matter effects in the sun .",
    "a careful analysis shows that the observed survival probability of solar @xmath119 neutrino oscillations can approximate to @xmath138 @xcite , leading us to @xmath139 .",
    "moreover , the borexino experiment has accomplished a real - time measurement of the mono - energetic solar @xmath140 neutrinos with @xmath141 mev and observed a remarkable deficit corresponding to @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "such a result can roughly be explained as a vacuum oscillation effect , because the low - energy @xmath140 neutrino oscillation is not very sensitive to matter effects @xcite . in this case",
    "we are left with the averaged survival probability @xmath143 as a reasonable approximation for solar @xmath140 neutrinos , and thus obtain @xmath144 .",
    "this result is essentially consistent with the one extracted from solar @xmath119 neutrinos .",
    "the atmospheric @xmath11 , @xmath27 , @xmath10 and @xmath5 events are produced in the earth s atmosphere by cosmic rays , mainly via the decays @xmath145 with @xmath146 and @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
    "so the ratio of @xmath11 and @xmath27 events to @xmath10 and @xmath5 events is expected to be nearly @xmath149 at low energies ( @xmath57 gev ) . but",
    "a smaller ratio was observed at the kamiokande @xcite and imb @xcite detectors in the late 1980s and early 1990s , indicating a preliminary deficit of atmospheric muon neutrinos and muon antineutrinos .",
    "if there were no neutrino oscillation , the atmospheric neutrinos that enter and excite an underground detector would have an almost perfect spherical symmetry .",
    "namely , the downward - going and upward - going neutrino fluxes should be equal to each other , or equivalently @xmath150 and @xmath151 for the zenith angle @xmath152 . in 1998",
    "the sk collaboration observed an approximate up - down flux symmetry for atmospheric @xmath10 and @xmath5 events and a significant up - down flux asymmetry for atmospheric @xmath11 and @xmath27 events @xcite .",
    "the sk detector is a @xmath153-ton tank of ultra - pure water , located approximately 1 km underground in the mozumi mine in kamioka . as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , the inside surface of the tank is lined with more than @xmath154 photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "an additional layer of water called the outer detector is also instrumented pmts to detect any charged particles entering the central volume and to shield the inner detector by absorbing any neutrons produced in the nearby rock .",
    "a neutrino interacting with the electrons or nuclei of water can produce a charged particle that moves faster than the speed of light in water , creating a cone of light known as cherenkov radiation .",
    "the cherenkov light is projected as a ring on the wall of the detector and recorded by the pmts .",
    "hence the direction and flavor of an incident neutrino can be identified by using the details of the ring pattern .    as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the observed deficit of atmospheric upward - going @xmath11 and @xmath27 events at sk could naturally be attributed to @xmath155 and @xmath156 oscillations , because the detector itself was insensitive to @xmath12 and @xmath157 events .",
    "this was actually the first _ model - independent _ evidence for neutrino oscillations , and it marked the threshold of a new era in particle physics . since 1998",
    "a number of breakthroughs have been made in experimental neutrino physics .    -like and @xmath8-like events with visible energy @xmath158 gev ( sub - gev ) and @xmath159 gev ( multi - gev ) . for multi - gev @xmath8-like events , a combined distribution with partially contained events",
    "is illustrated .",
    "the dotted histograms show the non - oscillation monte carlo events , and the solid histograms show the best - fit expectations for atmospheric @xmath160 oscillations @xcite.,width=321 ]    in 2004 the sk collaboration carried out a careful analysis of the @xmath11 ( or @xmath27 ) disappearance probability as a function of the neutrino flight length @xmath94 over the neutrino energy @xmath161 , and observed a dip in the @xmath162 distribution as the first _",
    "evidence for atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "this dip was consistent with the prediction from the sinusoidal flavor transition probability of neutrino oscillations , but inconsistent with the exotic neutrino decay and neutrino decoherence scenarios .    to directly observe the atmospheric @xmath155 oscillation is quite difficult because it requires the neutrino beam energy greater than a threshold of 3.5 gev , such that a tau lepton can be produced via the charged - current interaction of incident @xmath12 with the target nuclei in the detector .",
    "but the sk data are found to be best described by neutrino oscillations that include the @xmath12 appearance in addition to the overwhelming signature of the @xmath11 disappearance .",
    "a neural network analysis of the zenith - angle distribution of multi - gev contained events has recently demonstrated this observation at the @xmath163 level @xcite .",
    "if the observed deficit of atmospheric @xmath11 and @xmath27 events is ascribed to neutrino oscillations , then a fraction of the accelerator - produced @xmath11 and @xmath27 events should also disappear on their way to a remote detector .",
    "this expectation has definitely been confirmed by two long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments : k2k @xcite and minos @xcite .",
    "the k2k experiment was designed in such a way that the @xmath11 beam was produced at the kek accelerator and measured 250 km away at the sk detector in kamioka . in comparison ,",
    "the baseline length of the minos experiment is 735 km , from the source of @xmath11 neutrinos at fermilab to the far detector in northern minnesota .",
    "both of them have observed a reduction of the @xmath11 flux and a distortion of the @xmath11 energy spectrum , implying @xmath160 oscillations .",
    "the most striking result obtained from the atmospheric and accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments is @xmath164 or @xmath165 , which might hint at a special flavor structure or a certain flavor symmetry in the neutrino sector @xcite .",
    "an especially important accelerator neutrino oscillation experiment is the t2k experiment with a @xmath11 beam produced from the j - parc main ring in tokai and pointing to the sk detector at a distance of 295 km .",
    "its main goal is to discover @xmath166 appearance oscillations and perform a precision measurement of @xmath160 disappearance oscillations .",
    "since its preliminary data were first released in june 2011 , the t2k experiment has proved to be very successful in establishing the @xmath10 appearance out of a @xmath11 beam at the @xmath167 level and constraining the neutrino mixing parameters @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the point is that the leading term of @xmath170 is sensitive to @xmath171 , and its sub - leading term is sensitive to @xmath84 and terrestrial matter effects @xcite .",

    "the opera experiment was designed to search for the @xmath12 appearance in a @xmath11 beam traveling from cern to gran sasso at a distance of 730 km .",
    "after several years of data taking , the opera collaboration reported four @xmath12 candidate events in 2014 .",
    "these events are consistent with @xmath155 oscillations with the @xmath175 significance @xcite .      since the first discovery of electron antineutrinos with the help of the savannah river reactor in 1956 @xcite , reactors have been playing an important role in neutrino physics . in particular , two of the three neutrino mixing angles ( @xmath176 and @xmath168 ) have been measured in the kamland @xcite and daya bay @xcite reactor antineutrino oscillation experiments to an unprecedentedly good degree of accuracy .     and @xmath177 hold @xcite.,width=343 ]    the average baseline length of the kamland experiment was @xmath178 km , and hence it was sensitive to the @xmath179-driven @xmath105 oscillation and allowed a terrestrial test of the large - mixing - angle ( lma ) msw solution to the solar neutrino problem . under cpt invariance",
    "the kamland measurement @xcite firmly established the lma solution for the first time , and pinned down the correct parameter space of solar @xmath180 oscillations constrained by the sno and sk experiments , as shown in fig . 6 in the two - flavor scheme @xcite .",
    "a striking sinusoidal behavior of @xmath181 against @xmath162 was also demonstrated in the kamland experiment @xcite .",
    "while the chooz @xcite and palo verde @xcite reactor antineutrino experiments tried to search for the @xmath182-driven @xmath105 oscillations at the end of the 20th century , they found no indication in favor of such oscillations and thus set an upper bound on the smallest neutrino mixing angle @xmath168 .",
    "this situation has been changed by the daya bay @xcite , reno @xcite and double chooz @xcite experiments in the past few years .",
    "the daya bay experiment was designed to probe the smallest neutrino mixing angle @xmath168 with an unprecedented sensitivity @xmath183 by measuring the @xmath184-driven @xmath105 oscillation with a baseline length @xmath185 km . in this experiment",
    "the electron antineutrino beam takes its source at the daya bay nuclear power complex located in shenzhen , as shown in fig .",
    "the eight antineutrino detectors deployed at the near ( two plus two ) and far ( four ) sites are all the liquid scintillator detectors . in march 2012",
    "the daya bay collaboration announced a @xmath186 discovery of @xmath187 , with @xmath188 ( see fig . 8 for illustration )",
    "a similar but slightly less significant result was later achieved in the reno @xcite and double chooz @xcite reactor antineutrino experiments .",
    "oscillations observed at the near and far experimental halls ( i.e. , eh1 , eh2 and eh3 ) in the daya bay experiment @xcite.,width=359 ]    the daya bay collaboration has also measured the energy dependence of @xmath5 disappearance and observed a nearly full oscillation cycle against @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "an improved result of the oscillation amplitude @xmath189 has recently been obtained by using the observed @xmath5 rate and the observed energy spectrum in the three - flavor framework @xcite .",
    "the relative large value of @xmath168 is very encouraging for the next - generation precision neutrino experiments , which aim to determine the neutrino mass ordering and probe leptonic cp violation in the foreseeable future .",
    "the aforementioned neutrino or antineutrino oscillation experiments involve different sources , different flavors , different energies and different baseline lengths .",
    "but the relevant experimental data can all be explained in the scheme of three - flavor oscillations , which depend on two independent neutrino mass - squared differences ( @xmath190 , @xmath174 ) , three flavor mixing angles ( @xmath176 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 ) and one cp - violating phase ( @xmath84 )",
    ". a global fit of all the available experimental data is therefore needed in order to determine or constrain the six oscillation parameters .    a global three - flavor analysis of current experimental data on solar ( sno , sk , borexino ) , atmospheric ( sk ) , accelerator ( minos , t2k ) and reactor ( kamland , daya bay , reno ) neutrino or antineutrino oscillations",
    "has recently been done by several groups @xcite . for the sake of simplicity , here we only quote the main results obtained by the italian group @xcite , and @xmath191 are used .",
    "their relations with @xmath179 and @xmath182 are rather simple : @xmath192 and @xmath193 . ] as listed in table 1 .    table 1 shows that the output values of @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath84 in such a global fit are sensitive to the sign of @xmath184 .",
    "that is why it is crucial to determine the neutrino mass ordering in the upcoming neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the hint @xmath194 ( or @xmath195 ) at the @xmath196 level is still preliminary but quite encouraging , because it implies a potential effect of leptonic cp violation which is likely to show up in some long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments in the foreseeable future .",
    "the possibility @xmath197 can not be ruled out at the @xmath198 level , and thus a more precise determination of @xmath169 is required in order to resolve its octant .",
    "it is worth pointing out that @xmath199 ( for @xmath56 ) , the so - called @xmath8-@xmath9 permutation symmetry of the pmns matrix @xmath79 itself , holds if either the conditions @xmath200 and @xmath197 or the conditions @xmath201 ( or @xmath202 ) and @xmath203 are satisfied @xcite . now that @xmath200 has definitely been excluded ,",
    "it is imperative to know the values of @xmath169 and @xmath84 as accurately as possible , so as to fix the strength of @xmath8-@xmath9 symmetry breaking associated with the structure of @xmath79 .",
    "the neutrino mass ordering can be explored with either reactor electron antineutrinos or atmospheric muon neutrinos in the  disappearance \" oscillation experiments , or with accelerator muon neutrinos in the  appearance \" oscillation experiments .",
    "let us take the juno @xcite , pingu @xcite and lbne @xcite experiments for example to illustrate the future prospects in this regard .",
    "the juno electron antineutrino detector is expected to be a 20-kiloton liquid - scintillator detector located in the jiangmen city of guangdong province in southern china , about 53 km away from the yangjiang ( 17.4 @xmath204 ) and taishan ( 18.4 @xmath205 ) reactor facilities which serve as the @xmath5 source .",
    "( 5 ) , the survival probability of @xmath105 oscillations can be explicitly expressed as @xmath206 \\ ; , %      ( 6)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath207 . in eq .",
    "( 6 ) the oscillating argument @xmath208 is unambiguous , and the neutrino mass ordering is determined by the sign of @xmath209 ( normal : positive ; inverted : negative ) . to distinguish the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy from the normal one ,",
    "it is necessary to measure the @xmath209-driven oscillations over many cycles on condition that @xmath210 is satisfied for @xmath211 km as taken in the juno experiment @xcite .",
    "9 illustrates why this idea works .     at a baseline @xmath212 km , where the blue ( normal ) or red ( inverted ) fine structure can tell the neutrino mass hierarchy after a fourier transformation of the spectrum @xcite.,width=359 ]    now the juno experiment s civil construction is underway , and its detector assembly is planned for 2018 to 2019 .",
    "data taking will commence in 2020 , with a target of about six years of operation to pin down the neutrino mass ordering at the @xmath213 or @xmath214 level @xcite .",
    "the challenges for this experiment , which must be met successfully , are mainly technological , such as how to improve the scintillator light yield , attenuation length and pmt quantum efficiency @xcite .",
    "the pingu experiment is a proposed low - energy infill extension of the icecube experiment at the south pole @xcite .",
    "its design closely follows the one used for icecube and deepcore .",
    "the idea is to further infill the central deepcore volume with 40 new strings of 60 optical modules each , so that the neutrino trigger energy threshold can be lowered to a few gev and thus high - quality reconstructions for neutrino events can be achieved between 5 and 15 gev .",
    "such a detector geometry will be able to distinguish between the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies at the @xmath213 significance with an estimated 3.5 years of data taking .",
    "the survival probability of atmospheric muon neutrinos that reach the pingu detector after propagation through the earth ( i.e. , from below ) depends on their beam energy @xmath161 and propagation length @xmath94 .",
    "thanks to interactions with electrons within the earth , a resonant flavor conversion can happen at a specific pattern of neutrino energies and earth - crossing paths .",
    "this matter - induced resonant conversion occurs only for neutrinos in the normal mass ordering or only for antineutrinos in the inverted mass ordering , as the behaviors of @xmath160 and @xmath215 oscillations depend respectively on @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the number density of electrons in matter and @xmath161 denotes the neutrino beam energy .",
    "the pingu detector is capable of discriminating the cross sections and kinematics of neutrino and antineutrino interactions with nuclei , so it is capable of identifying different detected event rates which depend on different neutrino mass orderings .",
    "given an accelerator - driven neutrino beam , the long - baseline oscillation experiments are also sensitive to the neutrino mass ordering . because of the interaction of neutrinos with terrestrial matter as they pass through the earth , the probability of @xmath166 oscillations can be approximately expressed as @xcite @xmath218 where @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "one may easily obtain the expression of @xmath221 from eq .",
    "( 7 ) with the replacements @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "so the sign of @xmath184 affects the behaviors of neutrino oscillations via the signs of @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "that is why the matter - induced resonant conversion can only occur for neutrinos in the normal mass hierarchy ( @xmath226 ) or for antineutrinos in the inverted mass hierarchy ( @xmath227 ) , similar to the case of atmospheric neutrino or antineutrino oscillations . in practice",
    "the baseline length @xmath94 of an experiment is crucial for its sensitivity to the mass hierarchy . the lbne experiment @xcite with @xmath228 km is therefore expected to be more promising than the t2k experiment @xcite with @xmath229 km and the no@xmath230a experiment @xcite with @xmath231 km in this respect .",
    "but the undetermined cp - violating phase @xmath84 may in general give rise to some uncertainties associated with a determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy in the long - baseline experiments .",
    "in particular , a careful analysis shows that the mass hierarchy sensitivity is most optimistic ( or pessimistic ) for @xmath232 in the normal ( or inverted ) hierarchy case , or for @xmath233 in the inverted ( or normal ) hierarchy case @xcite . regardless of possible values of @xmath84 , lbne in combination with t2k and no@xmath230a promises to resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy with a significance of more than @xmath20 by 2030 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the proposed hyper - kamiokande ( hk ) detector will be a next - generation underground water cherenkov detector serving as the far detector of the 295 km - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment for the j - parc neutrino beam @xcite .",
    "it is expected to be ten times larger than the sk detector and capable of probing the neutrino mass ordering , resolving the octant of the largest flavor mixing angle @xmath169 and observing leptonic cp violation as well as proton decays and extraterrestrial neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources .",
    "cp violation in the lepton sector may have far - reaching impacts on our understanding of the origin of matter - antimatter asymmetries at both microscales and macroscales .",
    "the lbne and hk experiments , together with other next - generation long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments , are aiming at a determination of the cp - violating phase @xmath84 .",
    "the latter can be extracted from comparing between the probabilities of @xmath166 and @xmath234 oscillations , but it is in general contaminated by terrestrial matter effects . in the leading - order approximation ,",
    "@xmath235 where the term of matter effects should more or less be correlated with the neutrino mass ordering . to lower the matter contamination ,",
    "one may therefore consider a low - energy neutrino ( or antineutrino ) beam with a much shorter baseline length @xcite .",
    "a proposal of this kind is the moment project with a neutrino beam energy @xmath236 mev and a baseline length @xmath237 km @xcite , towards probing leptonic cp violation before a more powerful neutrino factory is built .",
    "soon after fermi developed an effective beta decay theory @xcite , maria goeppert - mayer pointed out that certain even - even nuclei should have a chance to decay into the second nearest neighbors via two simultaneous beta decays @xcite : @xmath238 , where the kinematic conditions @xmath239 and @xmath240 must be satisfied . in 1939 wendell furry further pointed out that the @xmath70 decays @xmath241 could happen via an exchange of the _ virtual _ neutrinos between two associated beta decays @xcite , provided the neutrinos are massive and have the majorana nature @xcite . if such a @xmath70 process is measured , does it definitely imply the existence of a majorana mass term for neutrinos ?",
    "the answer is affirmative according to the schechter - valle theorem @xcite , no matter whether there are new physics contributions to the @xmath70 decays .",
    "hence the @xmath70 transitions can serve for an experimentally feasible probe towards identifying the majorana nature of massive neutrinos at low energies .",
    "the half - life of a @xmath70-decaying nuclide can be expressed as follows : @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the phase - space factor , @xmath244 stands for the relevant nuclear matrix element , and @xmath245 denotes the effective majorana neutrino mass in the absence of new physics contributions . among them",
    ", the calculation of @xmath246 relies on the chosen nuclear models which are only able to approximately describe the many - body interactions of nucleons in nuclei , and thus it involves the largest theoretical uncertainty ( e.g. , a factor of two or three for some typical nuclei ) @xcite .",
    "this causes quite a big uncertainty associated with the determination of @xmath247 .",
    "so far no convincing evidence for an occurrence of the @xmath70 decay has been established , although a lot of experimental efforts have been made in the past few decades .",
    "such an experiment is designed to observe the two electrons emitted in a given @xmath70 decay , and its signature is based on the fact that the sum of the energies of the two emitted electrons is equal to the @xmath248-value of this process .",
    "in contrast , the energy spectrum of the two emitted electrons in a normal double - beta decay must be continuous . at present",
    "the strongest upper bound on the effective mass term @xmath249 can be set by the @xmath250 and @xmath251 experiments @xcite .",
    "in particular , the gerda @xcite , exo-200 @xcite and kamland - zen @xcite experiments have obtained @xmath252 , @xmath253 and @xmath254 at the @xmath255 confidence level , respectively .",
    "these results lead to the constraints @xmath256@xmath257 ev , @xmath258@xmath259 ev and @xmath260@xmath261 ev at the same confidence level , respectively , after the relevant uncertainties of nuclear matrix elements are taken into account @xcite .     as a function of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath262 ( normal hierarchy , red band ) or @xmath263 ( inverted hierarchy , green band ) @xcite . here",
    "the horizontally - excluded region comes from the @xmath70 experiments @xcite , and the vertically - excluded region is due to the cosmological bound @xcite.,width=283 ]    the expected magnitude of @xmath249 in the standard three - flavor case is illustrated in fig .",
    "10 , where current neutrino oscillation data have been input and arbitrary values of the cp - violating phases have been taken @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the inverted neutrino mass ordering or a near neutrino mass degeneracy may allow @xmath264 ev , which should be accessible in the next - generation @xmath70-decay experiments .",
    "if the neutrino mass spectrum is normal and hierarchical , however , there will be little prospect of observing any @xmath70 decays in the foreseeable future , simply because of @xmath265 ev in this unfortunate case .",
    "since the flavor oscillations of massive neutrinos are only sensitive to the neutrino mass - squared differences , a determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale has to rely on some non - oscillation experiments . searching for the @xmath70 decay is one of the feasible ways for this purpose if massive neutrinos are the majorana particles , because the magnitude of its effective mass term @xmath245 is associated with @xmath266 as shown in eq .",
    "( 9 ) and fig .",
    "another way is to detect the beta decays , such as @xmath267 , whose effective neutrino mass term @xmath268 is defined via @xmath269 the most promising experiment of this kind is the katrin experiment @xcite , which may hopefully probe @xmath268 with a sensitivity of about @xmath258 ev in the near future .",
    "but up to now only @xmath270 ev has been obtained at the @xmath271 confidence level from the troitzk beta - decay experiment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one may get useful information on the mass scale of light neutrinos from cosmology .",
    "based on the standard @xmath52cdm model , a global analysis of current cosmological data ( especially those on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and large - scale structure ( lss ) formation ) can provide us with the most powerful sensitivity to the sum of light neutrino masses via the relation @xmath272 in which @xmath273 denotes the light neutrino contribution to today s energy density of the universe , and @xmath274 is the hubble constant . for example , @xmath275 ev has recently been reported by the planck collaboration at the @xmath271 confidence level @xcite . if a combination of the next - generation cmb and lss measurements can reach a sensitivity of about @xmath276 ev for the sum of three neutrino masses @xcite , then it will be possible to determine the absolute neutrino mass scale via a definite determination of @xmath277 even though the neutrino mass ordering is normal .    note",
    "that it is also possible to determine or constrain the absolute neutrino mass scale @xmath278 through the study of kinematic effects of supernova neutrinos , because their flight time from a supernova s core to a terrestrial detector will be more or less delayed as compared with the massless particles @xcite .",
    "a careful analysis of the @xmath5 events from the supernova 1987a explosion led us to an upper bound of about @xmath279 ev on @xmath278 @xcite .",
    "the prospects of this astrophysical approach depend on the emergence of new neutrino detectors or the existence of antineutrino pulses in the first instants of a supernova explosion @xcite . given the juno liquid scintillator detector as an example , @xmath280 ev",
    "is expected to be achievable at the @xmath271 confidence level for a typical galactic supernova at a distance of @xmath281 kpc from the earth @xcite .",
    "since 1998 , quite a lot of significant breakthroughs have been made in experimental neutrino physics .",
    "on the one hand , the exciting phenomena of atmospheric , solar , reactor and accelerator neutrino or antineutrino oscillations have all been observed , and the oscillation parameters @xmath179 , @xmath282 , @xmath176 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 have been determined to an impressive degree of accuracy . on the other hand , the geo - antineutrino events and extraterrestrial pev neutrino events have been observed , and the sensitivities to neutrino masses in the beta decays , @xmath70 decays and cosmology have been improved to a great extent .",
    "furthermore , a lot of theoretical efforts have also been made towards understanding the origin of tiny neutrino masses and the flavor structure behind the observed neutrino mixing pattern , and towards studying possible implications of massive neutrinos on the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry , warm dark matter and many violent astrophysical processes @xcite .",
    "all these have demonstrated neutrino physics to be one of the most important frontiers of particle physics , astrophysics and cosmology .    but a number of fundamental questions about massive neutrinos remain open .",
    "the burning ones include how small the absolute neutrino mass scale is , whether the neutrino mass spectrum is normal or inverted , whether massive neutrinos are the majorana particles , how large the cp - violating phase @xmath84 is , which octant the largest flavor mixing angle @xmath169 belongs to , whether there are light and ( or ) heavy sterile neutrinos , what the role of neutrinos is in dark matter , whether the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe is related to cp violation in neutrino oscillations , etc .",
    "motivated by so many questions , we are trying to discover a new physics world with the help of massive neutrinos in the coming decades .",
