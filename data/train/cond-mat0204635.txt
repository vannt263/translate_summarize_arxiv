    "the production of ultra - cold neutrons ( ucn ) @xcite in superfluid helium and their subsequent storage allowing the build up of densities much greater than would be achievable at thermal equilibrium with the helium ( superthermal ucn source)@xcite is the foundation for several current and proposed experiments with ucn @xcite . although calculations of the production rate have been presented previously @xcite the early calculations concentrated on the production due to the resonant ( 8.9 ) phonons .",
    "measurements @xcite have shown a rather narrow peak in the production cross section as expected . in the course of the first calculation @xcite estimates had been made of the contribution due to higher energy incident neutrons downscattering on the multiphonon excitation tail in @xmath0 and these neutrons were found to contribute about the same amount of ucn production as the resonant neutrons for a reasonable assumed spectrum .",
    "however as the initial work was part of a proposal for an experiment it was felt that it would be more conservative not to include this in the initial estimates of ucn density i.e. to keep this in hand as a factor of safety for the predicted intensity for the new source .",
    "however the fact that multiphonon processes would increase the ucn production rate was mentioned .    in recent years",
    "the comparison between theory and experiment has improved significantly and there are several proposals to operate a superthermal helium ucn source with a monochromatic beam of 8.9   neutrons , so the question of the production rate due to multiphonon processes has some practical importance .",
    "in addition , due to a vigorous experimental program @xcite , much more detailed information concerning @xmath1 has become available . for these reasons",
    "it has become necessary to re - examine the situation . w. schott , in particular ,",
    "has emphasized the importance of the ucn production due to higher energy neutrons .",
    "this work is concerned with calculations of the ucn production rate when a volume of superfluid he@xmath2 at temperatures of @xmath3 is exposed to a neutron flux .",
    "the steady state ucn density in the source is given by@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the production rate , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the ucn lifetime against all losses in the helium filled storage chamber .",
    "lifetimes @xmath8 seconds should be achievable . the storage time in superfluid helium has been measured in @xcite .",
    "a neutron at rest can absorb energy @xmath9 and momentum @xmath10 with @xmath11 with  ( @xmath12 mev / @xmath13 ) and contrarily a neutron with this energy and momentum can come to rest after transferring its energy and momentum to the superfluid . for single phonon interactions , which are usually dominant , the superfluid can only exchange quantities of energy and momentum that are related by the dispersion curve@xmath14 where the last relation is an approximation to simplify the discussion . then neutrons can only come to rest by emission of a single phonon if they have the resonant energy @xmath15 given by the intersection of equations ( [ one ] ) and ( [ two])@xmath16 in addition to one phonon interactions there are multiple phonon interactions occurring at higher input energies that can also produce ucn .",
    "these are the main subject of this work .",

    "[ fig1 ] and using equation ( [ 101 ] ) @xmath65 these figures will be reduced by a factor of 2 when the flux ( calculated here for a modest source volume as described above ) is averaged over a more reasonable 20 liter volume .",
    "the effects of construction materials in a realistic design have not yet been taken into account .",
    "the advantages of such a design were discussed in [ ] .",
    "the main point is that the ucn production process is independent of the direction of the incident neutrons so that use is made of the full solid angle of the flux .",
    "installations at a beam position , as discussed in the next section , lose a solid angle factor of about 10@xmath2 [ ] in comparison to installations inside a 4@xmath66 flux , although such sources outperform any other type of ucn source that could be installed at the same beam position .",
    "it has been proposed to place a superthermal source of ucn on a monochromatic 8.9  beam at a guide tube at the sns.@xcite it is interesting to ask what the loss of ucn production rate associated with the use of a monochromatic beam would be in the case of the simulated spectra available for the planned guide tubes .",
    "spectra have been simulated for two types of guide : an ordinary supermirror guide and a so - called ballistic guide using tapered sections to focus and defocus the beam at the borders of a long free - flight region .",
    "this is an interesting case for the present discussion as the ballistic guide has more flux at the critical 8.9  wavelength but less flux at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath67 ) .",

    "this spectrum was measured at the nl4 neutron guide at the hahn meitner institut , berlin by time of flight . in this context",
    "we should remind the reader that the measurement of the spectrum from a neutron guide is quite complex as the spectra in general are very strong functions of the flight direction and position in the beam cross section . for the measured spectrum ( normalized to 1 at the peak of @xmath74 ) we find:@xmath75   = .025\\ ] ] yielding@xmath76    the one phonon contribution for this spectrum is found ( equ .

    "[ fig3 ] shows the spectrum and calculated ucn production rate as a function of the wavelength of the incident neutrons , @xmath78 , similar to what would be observed in a time of flight measurement .",
    "the results are summarized in the table below .",
    "the column labelled maxwell  refers to a maxwellian spectrum corrected for an ideal guide transmission @xmath79 and cut off at @xmath80  minimum wavelength .",
    "we see that the multiphonon contribution as expected is a rather strong function of the source spectrum varying from less than to slightly more than the one phonon production rate for the realistic spectra considered here .",

    "the multiphonon contribution is a small correction to the single phonon production so that the use of a monochromatic beam , which offers significant operating advantages @xcite , would be accompanied by a minor loss in ucn production .",
    "in contrast , for sources where the helium is exposed to the total thermal flux as in the north carolina state proposal or at a dedicated spallation source , the multiphonon contribution can amount to slightly more than a factor of 2 increase in ucn  production ."
