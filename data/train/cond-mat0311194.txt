    "traffic problems have been attracting not only engineers but also physicists @xcite . especially it has been widely accepted that the phase transition from free to congested traffic flow can be understood using methods from statistical physics @xcite . in order to study the transition in detail , we need a realistic model of traffic flow which should be minimal to clarify the underlying mechanisms . in recent years",
    "cellular automata ( ca ) @xcite have been used extensively to study traffic flow in this context . due to their simplicity , ca models have also been applied by engineers , e.g.  for the simulation of complex traffic systems with junctions and traffic signals @xcite .",
    "many traffic ca models have been proposed so far @xcite , and among these ca , the deterministic rule-184 ca model ( r184 ) , which is one of the elementary ca classified by wolfram @xcite , is the prototype of all traffic ca models .",
    "r184 is known to represent the minimum movement of vehicles in one lane and shows a simple phase transition from free to congested state of traffic flow . in a previous paper @xcite , using the ultra - discrete method @xcite , the burgers ca ( bca ) has been derived from the burgers equation @xmath0 which was interpreted as a macroscopic traffic model @xcite .",
    "the bca is written using the minimum function @xmath1 by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the number of vehicles at the site @xmath4 and time @xmath5 .",
    "if we put the restriction @xmath6 , it can be easily shown that the bca is equivalent to r184 .",
    "thus we have clarified the connection between the burgers equation and r184 , which offers better understanding of the relation between macroscopic and microscopic models .",
    "the bca given above is considered as the _ euler _ representation of traffic flow .",
    "as in hydrodynamics there is an another representation , called _ lagrange _ representation @xcite , which is specifically used for car - following models .",
    "the lagrange version of the bca is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the position of @xmath10-th car at time @xmath5 .",
    "note that in ( [ lagbca ] ) @xmath11 corresponds a `` perspective '' or anticipation parameter @xcite which represents the number of cars that a driver sees in front , and @xmath12 is the maximum velocity of cars .",
    "( [ lagbca ] ) is derived from the bca mathematically by using an euler - lagrange ( el ) transformation @xcite which is a discrete version of the well - known el transformation in hydrodynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we will develop the bca ( [ lagbca ] ) to a more realistic model by introducing slow - to - start ( s2s ) effects @xcite and a driver s perspective @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , a stochastic generalization is also considered by combining it with the nagel - schreckenberg ( ns ) model @xcite .",
    "first , let us extend ( [ lagbca ] ) to the case @xmath13 and combine it with the s2s model . the s2s model @xcite is written in lagrange form as @xmath14 note that the inertia effect of cars is taken into account in this model",
    ". comparing ( [ eqs2s ] ) and ( [ lagbca ] ) , we see that , in the s2s model , the velocity of a car depends not only on the present headway @xmath15 , but also on the past headway @xmath16 .",
    "this rule has only a nontrivial effect if @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e.  if the leading car has started to move in the previous time step . in this case",
    "the following car is not allowed to move immediately ( s2s ) .    before combining ( [ lagbca ] ) and",
    "( [ eqs2s ] ) , it is worth pointing out that we can choose the perspective parameter as @xmath19 in the model according to observed data .",
    "we define the size of a cell as 7.5  m and @xmath20 in our model according to the ns model .",
    "since @xmath12 corresponds to about 100  km / hour in reality , then one time step in the ca model becomes 1.3  s. moreover , the gradient of the free line and jamming line in the fundamental diagram , which is the dependence of the traffic flow @xmath21 on density @xmath22 , is known to be about 100  km / hour and @xmath23  km / hour @xcite according to many observed data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "these values correspond to the typical free velocity and the jam velocity , respectively .    ) and jamming line ( @xmath24 ) is known to be about 100  km / hour and @xmath23  km / hour .",
    "we also see that there is a wide scattering area near the phase transition region from free to jamming state .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    thus , considering the fact that the positive and negative gradient of each line is given by @xmath20 and @xmath25 , respectively , in the ca model @xcite , we should choose @xmath26 in the ca model .",
    "since only integer numbers for @xmath11 are allowed in this model , we will simply choose @xmath19 for studying the effect of the perspective of drivers .",
    "it is noted that other possibilities , such as velocity - dependent @xmath11 or stochastic choice of @xmath11 , are also possible .",
    "now by combining ( [ lagbca ] ) and ( [ eqs2s ] ) we propose a new lagrange model with @xmath19 which is defined by the rules listed below : let @xmath27 be the velocity of the @xmath10-th car at a time @xmath5 .",
    "the update procedure from @xmath5 to @xmath28 is divided into five stages :    1 .",
    "_ accerelation _ @xmath29 2 .",
    "_ slow - to - accelerate effect _",
    "@xmath30 3 .",
    "_ deceleration due to other vehicles _",
    "@xmath31 4 .",
    "_ avoidance of collision _",
    "@xmath32 5 .",
    "_ vehicle movement _ @xmath33    the velocity @xmath34 is used as @xmath27 in the next time step .",
    "( [ avoid ] ) is the condition that the @xmath10-th car does not overtake its preceding @xmath35-th car , including anticipation .",
    "the accerelation ( [ acdet ] ) is the same as in the ns model , which is needed for a mild accerelating behaviour of cars . in the step 2 ,",
    "we call ( [ s2a ] ) as `` slow - to - accelerate '' instead of s2s",
    ". this is because this rule affects not only the behaviour of standing cars but also that of moving cars , which is considered to be a generalization of s2s rule .",
    "it is not difficult to write down the new model in a single equation for general @xmath11 .",
    "the result is @xmath36 where the last term represents the collision - free condition explained in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and @xmath37 the condition that there is no collision between the @xmath10-th and @xmath38-th cars ( @xmath39 ) is given by @xmath40 for @xmath41 ( if @xmath42 then we simply put @xmath43 ) , which is identical to the last term in ( [ lagfm ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the ns model , the velocity of the preceeding car is taken into account in the calculation of the safe velocity in the step 4 , i.e.  our model also includes anticipation effects .",

    "next , we investigate the fundamental diagram of this new hybrid model .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we observe a complex phase transition from a free to congested state near the critical density 0.2 @xmath44 0.4 .",
    "there are many metastable branches in the diagram , similar to our previous models in euler form @xcite or in other models with anticipation @xcite .",
    "we also point out that there is a wide scattering area near the critical density in the observed data ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) which may be related to these metastable branches . as we will discuss later",

    "+ ( e )    next let us calculate the flow - density relation for each branch . in the metastable branches we find phase separation into a free - flow and a jamming region . in the former , pairs move with velocity @xmath46 and a headway of @xmath47 empty cells between consecutive pairs . in the jammed region ,",
    "the velocity of the pairs is @xmath48 and the headway @xmath49 . @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the numbers of cars in the jamming cluster and the free uniform flow , respectively .",

    "spatio - temporal patterns due to various kinds of perturbations are already seen in fig .",
    "perturbation in this case means that some cars are shifted backwards at the initial configuration .",

    "[ fig4](a)-(e ) are given as follows :    1 .",

    "we also consider random _ accerelation _ in this model which is not taken into account in the ns model .",

    "the randomization effect can be considered as a sort of perturbation to the deterministic model .",
    "hence some unstable branches seen in the deterministic case disappear in the stochastic case , especially if we consider the random braking effect as seen in fig .",

    "the model shows several metastable branches around the critical density in its fundamental diagram .",
    "the upper branches are unstable and will decrease its flow under perturbations .",
    "it is shown that the magnitude of a perturbation determines the final value of flow in the stationary state .",
    "moreover , introduction of stochasticity in the model makes the metastable branches dilute and hence produces a wide scattering area in the fundamental diagram .",
    "we would like to point out that this metastable region around the phase transition density is similar to so - called synchronized flow proposed by @xcite .",
    "our investigation shows that one possible origin of such a region is the occurance of many intermediate congested states near the critical density .",
    "if some of them are unstable due to perturbation or randomness , then a dense scattering area near the critical density is formed around the metastable branches .",
    "this is in some sense in between the two cases of a fundamental diagram based approach ( with unique flow - density relation ) and the so - called 3-phase model of @xcite which exhibits a full two - dimensional region of allowed states even in the deterministic limit .",
