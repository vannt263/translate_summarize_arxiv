    "these states have no classical analogies and exhibit particular statistical properties .",
    "relevant examples are superpositions of fock states , which can have applications in quantum computing @xcite .    of particular interest in the generation of quantum states of light fields",
    "is that associated with cavity qed , in which beams of atoms strongly interact with a single cavity electromagnetic mode .",
    "it is assumed that atom - cavity coupling strengths much larger than dissipative rates .",
    "yet another class of theory and experiments relevant to quantum communication and computation procedures is generation of entangled states @xcite .",
    "entangled states are interesting because they exhibit correlations that have no classical analog .",
    "a variety of proposals have been put forward for the generation of fock states in a cavity .",
    "the most simple system is a single two - level atom coupled with cavity - mode field .",
    "theoretical studies indicate the possibility to create and arbitrary prescribed superposition of fock states in a cavity via two - level atom interacting with quantum and classical fields @xcite .",
    "this model requires precise control of time sequences of amplitudes and phases of atom - cavity and atom - laser coupling fields . in a similar vein , domokos et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated an experimental scheme for the generation of fock states in a cavity .",
    "initially excited rydberg two - level atoms pass through and interact with two quantized field modes of the microwave cavity .",
    "specifically , the first mode is a photon reservoir prepared in a coherent state and the next one stores the fock states .",
    "finally , a fock states preparation scheme was suggested by parkins et al .",
    "@xcite , in which a beam of @xmath0-system atoms interact with a single quantized field mode of cavity and then with classical laser field .",
    "the initial eigenstate of the atom - cavity system , which corresponds to the atom being in first ground state , adiabatically evolves into a final eigenstate , which corresponds to the atom in the ground state and the cavity in a fock state .",
    "so , if initially there is no photon in the cavity , it is created one - photon fock state .",
    "because of the system evolution corresponds to the dark state , which has no contribution from excited atomic state , spontaneous emission does not figure in the dynamics of the system .    a scheme for preparation of pairs of massive atoms in an entangled state",
    "was predicted by cirac and zoller @xcite and then observed by hagley et al . @xcite .",
    "the states were produced by interaction with a high - q cavity .",
    "the technique of gerry and grobe @xcite for generation of an entangled state assumes a large number of two - level atoms confined in a cavity .    in the present paper",
    "we describe in detail a method for generation of coherent superposition of fock states in a cavity and demonstrate its feasibility by analytic and numerical calculations .",
    "our scheme requires the passage of a four - level atom through overlapping two classical laser fields and quantum cavity - mode field .",

    "have shown that using appropriate delay and sequence of interaction pulses one can create robust coherent superposition of atomic states .",
    "our scheme is based on those results .",
    "we show that , if one of the pulses is the quantum field of the cavity , a coherent superposition of quantum states is generated in the cavity .",
    "in fact , our scheme requires the following sequence of interactions with the atom ( see fig .",
    "[ pulses ] ) : the cavity - mode field is turned on before the first laser field arrives and is turned off after @xmath8 ceases .",
    "further , the second laser fields @xmath9 is turned on right after laser pulse and turned off the last .",
    "of most interest for us is the case when the cavity quantum field is initially in the vacuum state @xmath10 and the passage of the atom through the interaction region yields a superposition of zero - photon @xmath10 and one - photon @xmath11 states . by changing the relative delay of the pulses",
    ", one obtains arbitrary superposition of cavity quantum field states .",
    "further , we consider two four - level atoms , which are initially in the states @xmath2 and @xmath12 correspondingly . at early times",
    "the first atom interacts with the sequence of cavity field and equal laser fields ( @xmath13 ) . at late times , the second atom passes through the reversed configuration of pulses , i.e. equal laser pulses and then cavity field ( see fig .  [ entang ] ) . we will show that these sequences of interactions produce an entanglement of two atoms .",

    "the time dependence of @xmath26 and @xmath24 is provided by the motion of the atom through the interaction region .",
    "we express the solution of schrdinger equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) as a superposition of atomic basis states : @xmath27 here @xmath28 are the eigenvectors of the free atomic hamiltonian @xmath29 further , we transform the coefficients through the following expression : @xmath30 and , expanding the amplitudes @xmath31 in photon number states of the cavity , we have @xmath32 thus , in case of exact resonance we have the following equations for the coefficients of transformation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a column of coefficients @xmath35 , and    @xmath36    here the matrix elements @xmath37 are assumed to be real - valued , since any constant phases of laser fields can be absorbed in the definition of amplitudes @xmath35 .",

    "these states are therefore termed _ trapped _ or _ dark _ states .",
    "the significant feature of our scheme is that , if the system remains in some superposition of the two degenerate dark states , atomic spontaneous emission plays no role in the system dynamics .",
    "in order to place diagonally the matrix @xmath48 ( [ w ] ) we introduce a unitary matrix @xmath49 taking into consideration the non - adiabatic interactions between adiabatic energy eigenstates ( [ eigenvectors1 ] ) , ( [ eigenvectors2 ] ) we obtain : @xmath50 where @xmath51 @xmath52 obviously , through the conditions @xmath53 which imply that the effective pulse area is very large @xmath54 the coupling of the dark states ( [ eigenvectors1 ] ) to the bright states ( [ eigenvectors2 ] ) can be disregarded .",

[ entang ] ) .",
    "the initial state asymptotically coincides with the dressed state @xmath84 ( [ eigenvectors1 ] ) at very early times . at the end of the interaction , as can be easily seen from ( [ eigenvectors1 ] ) , ( [ eigenvectors2 ] ) the following connections exist between adiabatic and bare states .",
    "@xmath85    and @xmath86    again , under the conditions ( [ condition1 ] ) , ( [ condition2 ] ) in the adiabatic limit , we must take into account only transitions between the degenerate dressed states @xmath84 , @xmath87 .    at the next step , the reverse sequence of pulses ( i.e. the equal laser fields then the cavity field ) acts on the second atom , which is still in @xmath88 state ( see fig .",

    "as can be seen , the final result does not depend on the effective area of pulses ( [ area ] ) , and depends only on the angle @xmath91 or on the ratio of delay time and durations of two laser fields .",
    "that makes this method of creation of coherent superposition effective and robust against small variations of parameters .",
    "arbitrary coherent superposition of fock states in the cavity can be obtained by changing the value of the angle @xmath91 , i.e. the delay between laser pulses . especially , in the case of @xmath92 , we obtain fock states of the cavity field .    a variation of these basic ideas for interaction of cavity and laser fields with atomic systems is to employ the particular properties of the cavity field for the generation of entanglement of atoms . in this arrangement",
