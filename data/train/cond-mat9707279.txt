    "studies of highly correlated electron systems are one of the  hot  areas of condensed matter physics . a tremendous number of papers have been concerned with the problems such as heavy fermions , mott transitions , magnetism of highly correlated systems , unconventional mechanisms of superconductivity etc . in this context",
    "the classical problem of charge ordering which has been raised by wigner @xcite and shubin and vonsovsky @xcite ( see also @xcite ) received far less attention . as early as the 1930s , the famous verwey transition in magnetite fe@xmath0o@xmath1 at the temperature",
    "@xmath2 has been discovered . according to the traditional views ,",
    "this is the transition from the low - temperature insulating phase with fe@xmath3 and fe@xmath4 ions forming superlattice ( wigner crystal ) to the high - temperature conducting phase with the destroyed charge ordering @xcite .",
    "however , recent experimental data point to a more complicated physical picture since the long - range charge ordering below @xmath5 appeared to be pronounced rather weakly @xcite and the infrared spectra show  tunneling modes  which are presumably connected with the  smearing  of fe@xmath3 and fe@xmath4 ions over finite clusters @xcite .",
    "the assertion that namely the charge ordering of fe@xmath3 and fe@xmath4 ions is the cause of the metal - insulator transition is also called in question in a number of experimental works @xcite .",
    "phenomena similar to the verwey transition are observed also in a number of other compounds , e.g. , in r@xmath0x@xmath1 ( r = sm , eu ; x = s , se ) , yb@xmath1as@xmath0 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , in the layered compounds rfe@xmath6o@xmath1 , where r is a rare - earth ion @xcite . some of these compounds ( e.g. , eu@xmath0s@xmath1 ) exhibit long - range charge ordering at low temperatures , and other ones ( e.g. , sm@xmath0se@xmath1 ) show only short - range ordering . in the latter case",
    ", a number of physical properties appeared to be anomalous , e.g. , a giant low - temperature heat capacity which is not connected with current carriers is observed @xcite .",
    "irkhin and katsnelson @xcite suggested that an rvb ( or pseudospin liquid ) -type state with separated pseudospin and current degrees of freedom may be formed in such systems .",
    "hence , the problem of description of the verwey transition and related phenomena seems to be rather interesting from both experimental and theoretical points of view and may turn out to be closely related to the more popular areas of the physics of highly correlated electron systems .",
    "to consider the effects of strong correlations in crystals including charge ordering the polar model @xcite is usually used with the hamiltonian    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the creation and annihilation electron operators , @xmath10 is the site ( wannier state ) index , @xmath11 is the spin projection ; @xmath12 is the operator of electron number on site @xmath10 ; @xmath13 is the transfer integral ; @xmath14 are the matrix elements of coulomb interaction on - site and between different sites correspondingly , and the primed summation symbol indicates that @xmath15 . in comparison with the original polar model this expression does not contain the multielectron contributions to the transfer processes and the direct exchange interaction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of electron - phonon interaction may be partially taken into account by the renormalization of the model parameters ( e.g. the formation of small - radius bipolarons by the condition @xmath16 etc . ) .    in the case of verwey transition in the magnetite",
    "the excess electrons distinguishing a fe@xmath4 site from a fe@xmath3 one are almost completely spin - polarized ( @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the curie temperature ) and fill the band by less than half . therefore the term with @xmath19",
    "may be omitted in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) and one may pass to the so - called spinless fermion model    @xmath20    in the limit @xmath21 the hamiltonian ( 1 ) coincides with ( 2 ) @xcite .",
    "more exactly , this is valid only in 1d case since in 2d and 3d systems the transfer hamiltonian is renormalized by the spin - polaron effects @xcite .",
    "but if we deal with ferromagnets ( this is the magnetite case ) the latter are absent .",
    "the present work is devoted to the rigorous numerical investigation of the ground state of the model ( 2 ) in 1d case with the allowing for the interaction and transfer processes for the next - nearest neighbors .",
    "as it will be shown below they lead to a number of novel effects in particular to the opportunity of dimerization or electronic phase transitions of  metal - metal  type .",
    "1d model may be considered not only as a simplified way to understand some features of real 3d case but also as a model to describe the processes in the conducting polymers and other quasi - one - dimensional crystals @xcite .    at @xmath22 the model ( 2 )",
    "is equivalent to the ising model and describes in the ground state a  frozen  electron distribution ( wigner crystal ) depending on the specific form of @xmath23 . at @xmath24",
    "we have the case of noninteracting electrons with the homogeneous distribution .",
    "intuitive considerations of energy gain for competing processes show that at @xmath25 the ground state should change",
    ".    in the nearest - neighbor approximation 1d model with the hamiltonian ( 2 ) appears to be exactly soluble @xcite . for the electron concentration per site @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( here and",
    "further we put @xmath28 ) the metal - insulator transition takes place with the appearance of the energy gap in the electron spectrum at @xmath29 .",
    "let us investigate for the beginning the effect of the interaction @xmath30 on this transition at @xmath31    for @xmath32 and @xmath26 the ground state in the model ( 2 ) is determined by the ratio of @xmath33 and @xmath30 and , as it may be easily demonstrated , corresponds to the  usual  charge ordering [ ... 10101010 ... ] for @xmath34 and dimer ordering",
    "[ ... 110011001100 ... ] for @xmath35 ( 1 means the electron and 0 means the hole on a site ) .",
    "so the model ( 2 ) is frustrated because of the competing nature of the interactions @xmath33 and @xmath36 ( they favor different types of charge ordering ) .",
    "let us define the quantity @xmath37 as follows : it is equal to 0 if the ground state degeneracy @xmath38 is macroscopically large ( i.e. increase faster than @xmath39 when @xmath40 at @xmath32 ; otherwise it is equal to the difference between the energies of the lowest excited state and the ground one at @xmath32 . it may be shown by the direct enumeration of possible states with the same energy that at @xmath32 the degeneracy @xmath38 is exponentially large in @xmath39 at @xmath41 and therefore @xmath42 in this case .",
    "one may obtain for @xmath26    @xmath43    and for @xmath44    @xmath45    as the electron transfer is taken into account the ground state for the case @xmath42 is split into the energy band with the bandwidth of order of @xmath46 since @xmath47 this band should be continuous in the limit @xmath48",
    ". therefore one should expect that no energy gap will appear between the ground state and the lowest excited one so the ground state will be always conducting at @xmath49 at @xmath50 and @xmath51 it is naturally to expect that the conducting ground state will transform to the insulating one with the increasing @xmath37 .",
    "the following question is to be elucidated : at what value of @xmath52 does the metal - insulator transition takes place and does the transition point depend on @xmath33 and @xmath30 separately ?    hence , the following is the list of questions to be answered : ( i ) does the metal - insulator transition exist at @xmath53 ( ii ) at @xmath54 does the metal - insulator transition occur at @xmath55 similarly to the exactly soluble case @xmath56 ( iii ) more generally , do the interaction constants enter the expression for the transition point mainly via the parameter @xmath57 ( iv ) how does the metal - insulator transition proceed at @xmath58 in particular at @xmath59 ( this filling corresponds to the situation in many real compounds , see e.g. @xcite ) ?",
    "these problems were considered already in a number of papers ( although , to our knowledge , for the case @xmath26 only ) . in @xcite",
    "the phase diagram of the 1d spinless fermion model ( rewritten in terms of spin operators @xcite ) with next - nearest - neighbor interaction has been obtained by the renormalization group approach . in @xcite",
    "the metal and insulator regions of this model has been investigated by an exact numerical calculation of  drude  contribution to the frequency dependent conductivity ( rather general approach to the numerical calculation of correlation functions for 1d many - electron systems see e.g. also in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the renormalization group method can give only general shape of the phase diagram and not the exact numerical results for the positions of phase boundaries .",
    "on the other hand , the calculations in @xcite have been carried out only for few sets of parameters of the model . the recent work @xcite contains the most detailed numerical investigation of the metal - insulator phase diagram in the model under consideration .",
    "below , the problem of metal - insulator transition in the model ( 2 ) will be investigated by the calculations of the total energy and energy gap by the lanczos method for the broader range of the parameters than in the previous papers and the answers to the above questions will be sought for .",
    "also the interesting phenomenon of the metal - metal transition which appears to be possible in the model with next - nearest - neighbor transfer processes will be studied .",
    "to investigate the ground state of the system we have used the lanczos method of exact diagonalization for finite clusters @xcite ( really we made the calculations for @xmath60 ) with the extrapolation to the limit @xmath61 .",
    "the comparison of the results with the exact ones at @xmath62 @xcite have shown that we have at least four accurate digits in the ground state energy and two ones in the energy gap ( which was calculated as the average difference of the ground state energy at the adding and removing the electron ) .",
    "such accuracy is sufficient to answer the questions formulated above .",
    "the main results are the following :    \\1 . at @xmath42",
    "the metal - insulator transition is absent and the ground state is always metallic both for @xmath26 and for @xmath44 ( the calculations have been carried out up to @xmath63 ) .",
    "the metal - insulator phase diagram for @xmath26 is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the metal - insulator transition takes place at @xmath64 qualitatively this result seems rather natural .",
    "nevertheless , it is not trivial , to our opinion , that it turned out to be valid with the accuracy comparable to the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "this result may be used for the testing of different approximations proposed for the investigation of 2d and 3d systems .",
    "qualitatively our phase diagram is in agreement with that from @xcite .",
    "moreover , the part of the phase diagram for which real calculations has been carried out in @xcite is the same .",
    "but our results for the region of large @xmath30 are new .",
    "the main difference is that , according to our results , the boundary lines of metal - insulator transition are not crossed and the metallic phase is continued to the infinity along the line @xmath65 in correspondence with the qualitative discussion in the introduction .",
    "fig.2 shows the phase diagram for @xmath44 .",
    "the criterion of the metal - insulator transition is @xmath66 this result is new even for the case @xmath67 .",
    "the phase diagram for this case is qualitatively different from that for @xmath26 ( compare figs.1 and 2 ) .",
    "in particular , the ground state is metallic for small enough @xmath30 and _ arbitrary _ @xmath33 .",
    "it is connected with the macroscopically large degeneracy of the ground state at @xmath68 also , it is not trivial that the position of the metal - insulator boundary with the accuracy of the calculations depend only on @xmath33 at @xmath69 and only on @xmath30 at @xmath70 . since the 1d spinless fermion model for @xmath44 was probably not considered earlier we present in the table 1 the results for the ground state energy and the energy gap .",
    "we also have carried out the calculations for the case @xmath26 with the adding of the third - neighbor interaction term @xmath71 it appears that the criterion of the metal - insulator transition @xmath55 is valid also in this case provided that the interaction potential is downwards - convex namely @xmath72 @xmath37 being equal to    @xmath73    this statement is illustrated by the data of the table 2 : in the case of the downwards - convex potentials ( upper part of the table ) the criterion @xmath74 holds but no simple criterion can be established for the opposite case ( lower part of the table ) . presumably , this affirmation is also valid for the electron - electron interaction of arbitrary range .",
    "the arguments justifying the downward - convexity condition for realistic quasi - one - dimensional compounds were presented by hubbard @xcite .    apart from the metal insulator transition , another interesting phenomenon studied in the spinless fermion model is the charge ordering . in particular , for @xmath26 the interplay of  usual  and dimerized ( wigner and peierls @xcite ) charge ordering can be discussed .",
    "our approach can not be applied directly to the solution of this problem since it is rather difficult to find asymptotics of the corresponding correlation functions directly from finite - cluster calculations .",
    "this problem can be investigated either by such approaches as analytical @xcite or numerical @xcite renormalization group or by the combination of exact diagonalization technique with the results of the theory of luttinger liquid ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless we present here our results about the characteristics of the _ short - range _ charge order in the model under consideration which can be interesting themselves .",
    "the results of the calculations for the correlation functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the ground state for @xmath26 are presented in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "consider first the case @xmath77 according to fig.3 in this case we always have @xmath78 which show the absence of the dimerization .",
    "the metal - insulator transition is almost not appreciable in the calculated correlation functions describing the short - range order .",
    "consider now the case @xmath79 .",
    "the data presented in fig . 4 show that as @xmath33 is decreased , the dimerized state with @xmath80 is probably destroyed before the metal - insulator transition occurs .",
    "one may suppose that as the transfer integral @xmath81 is increased starting from the atomic limit , first the dimer lattice melts and then the insulator - metal transition occurs . unfortunately the present results give us only preliminary indications of the melting of dimerized lattice ( because we can not investigate the asymptotics of the correlation functions and therefore have no direct information about long - range order ) , and this interesting question calls for further investigations .",
    "the results of calculations for the correlation functions @xmath82 @xmath76 and @xmath83 for @xmath44 and @xmath84 is shown in fig.5 .",
    "qualitatively the similar picture takes place for any @xmath85 . at large @xmath33 and @xmath30 ( or equivalently for @xmath86 ) we have @xmath87    so our calculations give a rather full description of the metal - insulator transition in the 1d spinless fermion model beyond the nearest neighbor approximation .",
    "they also provide a basis for further investigations in particular concerning the relation between the metal - insulator transition and the destruction of the charge ordering .",
    "one may think that the derived conclusions about the effects of competing interactions on the nature of verwey transition may be useful in analyzing the realistic 2d or 3d systems .",
    "apart from the metal - insulator transition considered above the interelectron interaction may lead to the electron phase transition of another type .",
    "it is connected with the next - nearest neighbor transfer processes . although the role of such processes in many - electron models is investigated in a number of works ( see e.g. recent paper @xcite ) the opportunity of such transition , to our knowledge ,",
    "was not noted and studied .",
    "it is easily seen that at @xmath91 the spectrum is nonmonotonic in the range @xmath92 . at @xmath93 and @xmath26 the second fermion  pocket  appears i.e. the electron - filled region in @xmath94 space is no longer singly connected .",
    "in other words , while the fermi surface of  normal  one - dimensional system consists of two points @xmath95 it consists of four points at @xmath93 and @xmath26 . in the latter case",
    "the occupied states corresponds to the intervals @xmath96 @xmath97 and @xmath98 it should be emphasized that 1d gas of non - interacting electrons can not exhibit a dispersion low of this type since it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the one - dimensional one - electron schroedinger equation for a periodic potential must necessarily exhibit a monotone @xmath99 spectrum between @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( the lattice parameter is set equal to unity everywhere ) .",
    "nevertheless , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) with @xmath91 may be used for the description of real systems e.g. consisting of the pairs of strongly coupled one - dimensional chains with weak coupling between different pairs . in this case",
    "@xmath81 is the transfer integral between the nearest sites in the direction across the double chain and @xmath102 is the transfer integral along it ( see fig .",
    "studying of such systems is not only of purely theoretical interest .",
    "it may give a deeper insight into the properties of realistic quasi - one - dimensional systems in particular the well - known compound nmp - tcnq ( the molecules of tcnq and nmp are shown in figs . 7a and 7b , respectively ) .",
    "this compound is characterized by a charge transfer from tcnq to nmp molecules ( about 1/3 electron per nmp molecule ) .",
    "as one nmp - tcnq cell contains one electron , half of the @xmath94 states between @xmath103 and @xmath104 are occupied .",
    "therefore the fermi surface consists of two sheets : one of them is bounded by @xmath105 and corresponds to the tcnq chain ; the other is bounded by @xmath106 and corresponds to nmp chain ( see fig .",
    "7c ) @xcite .",
    "it is rather natural to discuss in such a case the following question : what would happen to the distribution function upon switching the electron - electron interaction , i.e. , would the increasing interaction result only in a gradual smearing of the steps in the distribution function of electrons in @xmath94 space or a drastic change of its shape is also possible , e.g. , the merging of two steps ?",
    "it will be shown below that the second possibility really takes place .    before the presentation and discussion of exact numerical results",
    "it would be reasonable to treat this problem in the simplest hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the trial wave function will be chosen in the form corresponding to the distribution function with two steps in @xmath94 space of the widths @xmath107 and @xmath108 :          @xmath113 - &   \\nonumber \\\\ &",
    "\\displaystyle - \\frac{1}{\\pi } t^{\\prime}[\\sin ( 2\\rho\\pi - 2\\lambda ) + \\sin 2\\lambda ] - \\frac{v}{\\pi^2 } [ \\sin ( \\rho\\pi - \\lambda ) - \\sin\\lambda]^2 . & \\label{eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        where @xmath116 corresponds to one pocket and @xmath117 corresponds to two pockets .",
    "minimizing the energy with respect to @xmath118 one obtains that the increase of @xmath33 results in the merging of the two steps ( disappearing of the second pocket ) at a critical value      this means that the switching on the electron - electron interaction , according to the usual hartree - fock approximation , may lead to a topological transition i.e. a change in topology of fermi surface : the two - sheeted ( four point )  surface  transform into a one - sheeted ( two - point ) one . in a 3d case it would correspond to a transition from a doubly connected fermi surface to a singly connected one which is a particular case of the electronic topological transitions proposed by lifshitz @xcite .",
    "the investigation of such opportunity by a more rigorous way is the purpose of our calculations described below .",
    "the calculations have been carried out for a system of 10 electrons in the ring from 20 sites and of 8 electrons in the ring from 16 sites .",
    "the results for the points of the electronic topological transition in these two sets of calculations were the same with the accuracy of two significant digits .",
    "the computational results are shown in figs .",
    "fig.8 displays the distribution function in the ground state @xmath120 at @xmath121 .",
    "it is clearly seen that ",
    "the hump  near the edges of the brillouin zone ( @xmath122 ) disappears at @xmath123 .",
    "fig.9 presents the phase diagram of the system . the comparison with eq.(10 ) show that beginning from approximately @xmath124 the hartree - fock approximation gives too high values for @xmath125 and the difference with numerical results grows with increasing @xmath102 .",
    "so , the hartree - fock approximation is not very accurate quantitatively at large @xmath33 .    in the case",
    "@xmath126 the inverse topological transition turns out to be possible when the increase of the coulomb interaction results in the appearance of the second pocket .",
    "we have carried out the corresponding calculations for the case @xmath127 thus , without interaction the second minimum in the electron spectrum lies very close to the fermi level and above it .",
    "the interaction can make this minimum to be lower than the fermi level .",
    "the phase diagram for this case is shown in fig.10 .",
    "the hartree - fock approximation can describe qualiatively the phenomenon of  inverse  transition but gives too high values of the critical values of @xmath30 ( the difference may be in a factor of order of 2 - 5 depending on @xmath33 values ) .    to conclude this section note why these results are , to our opinion , non - trivial .",
    "it is well - known that for 1d systems the electron velocity may be zero either at @xmath100 or at the boundary of the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "therefore , true one - dimensional systems can not exhibit van hove singularities inside the allowed band and hence they exhibit no electronic topological transitions because the latter are nothing but the crossing of the fermi level by the van hove singularity . however , this is not the case for , e.g. , a double chain .",
    "the exact numerical results presented here suggest that in this case quasi - one - dimensional systems do may demonstrate electronic topological transitions . as in the 3d case",
    "@xcite they are , unlike metal - insulator transitions , transitions of metal - metal type . studying the possibility of such transitions in real quasi - one - dimensional conductors containing double chains would be of experimental interest ."
