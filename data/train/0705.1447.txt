    "<S> energetic partons with a large transverse momentum , produced in initial hard parton collisions before the formation of an equilibrated fireball , propagate through the fireball . in this process they will lose energy , which depends on the state of the fireball ( qpg or hadronic matter ) . </S>",
    "<S> energetic partons manifest themselves at jets arriving in the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of jet quenching due to the propagation of the leading parton of the jet through the fireball can therefore serve as a signature for the qgp formation @xcite . a strong jet quenching and suppression of high @xmath0 hadron spectra </S>",

    "<S> in electromagnetic plasmas wakes are a well known phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically they can be investigated by considering transport equations . in the collisionless case </S>",
    "<S> they follow from the dielectric functions by solving the vlasov equation together with the poisson equation . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in this way that wakes are also created in a qgp , leading eventually to attractive potentials and mach cones as well known in plasma physics ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> attractive potentials between partons might lead to bound states and may modify the @xmath1 suppression pattern @xcite . </S>",
