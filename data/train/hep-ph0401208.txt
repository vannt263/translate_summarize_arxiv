    "in many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) the neutrino acquires a nonzero mass , a magnetic moment and an electric dipole moment @xcite . in this manner",
    "the neutrinos seem to be likely candidates for carrying features of physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "apart from masses and mixings , magnetic moments and electric dipole moments are also signs of new physics and are of relevance in terrestrial experiments , in the solar neutrino problem , in astrophysics and in cosmology @xcite .    at the present time , all of the available experimental data for electroweak processes can be understood in the context of the standard model of the electroweak interactions ( sm ) @xcite , with the exception of the results of the super - kamiokande experiment on the neutrino - oscillations @xcite , as well as the gallex , sage , gno , homestake and lsnd @xcite experiments . nonetheless , the sm is still the starting point for all the extended gauge models . in other words ,",
    "any gauge group with physical characteristics must have as a subgroup the @xmath4 group of the standard model in such a way that their predictions agree with those of the sm at low energies .",
    "the purpose of the extended theories is to explain some fundamental aspects which are not clarified in the frame of the sm .",
    "one of these aspects is the origin of the parity violation at current energies .",
    "the left - right symmetric models ( lrsm ) , based on the @xmath5 gauge group @xcite , give an answer to this problem by restoring the parity symmetry at high energies and giving their violations at low energies as a result of the breaking of gauge symmetry .",
    "detailed discussions on lrsm can be found in the literature @xcite .    in 1994 ,",
    "t. m. gould and i. z. rothstein @xcite reported a bound on the tau neutrino magnetic moment which they obtained through the analysis of the process @xmath6 , near the @xmath2-resonance , by considering a massive tau neutrino and using standard model @xmath7 and @xmath8 couplings .    at low center of mass",
    "energy @xmath9 , the dominant contribution to the process @xmath1 involves the exchange of a virtual photon@xcite .",
    "the dependence on the magnetic moment comes from a direct coupling to the virtual photon , and the observed photon is a result of initial state bremsstrahlung .    at higher @xmath10 , near the @xmath2 pole @xmath11 , the dominant contribution for @xmath12 @xmath13 @xcite involves the exchange of a @xmath2 boson .",
    "the dependence on the magnetic moment and the electric dipole moment now comes from the radiation of the photon observed by the neutrino or antineutrino in the final state .",
    "the feynman diagrams which give the most important contribution to the cross section are shown in fig .",
    "we emphasize here the importance of the final state radiation near the @xmath2 pole , which occurs preferentially at high @xmath14 compared to conventional bremsstrahlung .",
    "our aim in this paper is to analyze the reaction @xmath15 .",
    "we use recent data collected with the l3 detector at cern lep @xcite near the @xmath2 boson resonance in the framework of a left - right symmetric model and we attribute an anomalous magnetic moment and an electric dipole moment to a massive tau neutrino .",
    "processes measured near the resonance serve to set limits on the tau neutrino magnetic moment and electric dipole moment . in this paper , we take advantage of this fact to set bounds for @xmath16 and @xmath17 for different values of the mixing angle @xmath3 @xcite , which is consistent with other constraints previously reported @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we do our analysis near the resonance of the @xmath2 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus , our results are independent of the mass of the additional heavy @xmath18 gauge boson which appears in these kinds of models .",
    "therefore , we have the mixing angle @xmath3 between the left and the right bosons as the only additional parameter besides the sm parameters .",
    "the l3 collaboration evaluated the selection efficiency using detector - simulated @xmath19 events , random trigger events , and large - angle @xmath20 events .",
    "a total of 14 events were found by the selection .",
    "the distributions of the photon energy and the cosine of its polar angle are consistent with sm predictions .",
    "the total number of events expected from the sm is 14.1 .",
    "if the photon energy is greater than half the beam energy , 2 events are selected from the data and 2.4 events are expected from the sm in the @xmath21 channel .",

    "ii we describe the model with the higgs sector having two doublets and one bidoublet . in sect .",

    "we consider a left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) consisting of one bidoublet @xmath22 and two doublets @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
