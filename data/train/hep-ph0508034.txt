    "the experimental evidences for neutrino oscillations collected in the last six years represent a major discovery in modern particle physics .",
    "the oscillation phenomenon allows the measurement of fundamental parameters of the standard model and provides the first insight beyond the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are important for many fields of astrophysics and cosmology and open the possibility to study cp violation in the leptonic sector .",
    "neutrino flavor oscillations can be described in term of three mass eigenstates @xmath0 with mass values @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 that are connected to the flavor eigenstates , and by a mixing matrix @xmath4 , usually parameterized as @xmath5    where the short - form notation @xmath6 is used . as a result ,",
    "the neutrino oscillation probability depends on 3 mixing angles , @xmath7 , 2 mass differences , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and a cp phase @xmath10 .",
    "additional phases are present in case neutrinos are majorana particles , but they do not influence at all neutrino flavor oscillations . furthermore , the neutrino mass hierarchy , the ordering with which mass eigenstates are coupled to flavor eigenstates , can be fixed by measuring the sign of @xmath11 . in vacuum",
    "the oscillation probability between two neutrino flavors @xmath12 , @xmath13 is :    @xmath14 \\sin^2{\\frac{\\delta m^2_{jk}l}{4e_\\nu } }   \\pm   2 \\sum_{k > j}im[w^{jk}_{\\alpha\\beta } ] \\sin^2{\\frac{\\delta m^2_{jk}l}{2e_\\nu } } \\label{eq : osc}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 . in the case of only two neutrino flavor oscillation",
    "it can be written as :    @xmath18    therefore two experimental parameters are relevant for neutrino oscillations : the neutrino energy @xmath19 and the baseline @xmath20 ( distance of the neutrino source from the detector ) ; in the oscillation formula they are combined into the @xmath21 ratio .",
    "when neutrinos pass through matter , the oscillation probability is perturbed @xcite depending on @xmath22@xcite .    three claims of neutrino flavor oscillations come from atmospheric neutrinos , solar neutrinos and beam dump experiments .    a clear evidence of disappearance of atmospheric neutrinos , through a strong zenithal modulation and an anomalous value of the ratio of electron to muon neutrino events is reported by the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite , a result well supported by soudan2 @xcite and macro @xcite experiments .",
    "furthermore , super - kamiokande reported an oscillation signature by directly measuring the @xmath21 parameter @xcite and detected an indirect evidence of @xmath23 appearance ruling out at 99% c.l . possible pure oscillations into sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "it follows that the most likely channel is an almost pure @xmath24 transition , connected with the @xmath2 and @xmath3 mass eigenstates , central values are @xmath25 , @xmath26 and at 90% c.l .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "mechanisms other than neutrino oscillations , as neutrino decay or decoherence @xcite , are almost completely ruled out by the experimental data .",
    "the long - baseline experiment k2k published evidence for disappearance in a neutrino beam with a mean energy @xmath29 gev sent to the super - kamiokande detector at a baseline of 250 km @xcite .",
    "the experimental result : @xmath30 , @xmath31 ev@xmath32 at 90 % c.l . , is in agreement with the atmospheric data .",
    "solar neutrino evidence for oscillations comes from the counting deficit of four experiments which took data at different thresholds : homestake @xcite , gallex - gno @xcite , sage @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite .",
    "the latter experiment also measured the energy shape distortions and day - night effects @xcite .",
    "the spectacular comparison of the charged current , elastic scattering and neutral current rates in the sno experiment @xcite allowed convincing evidence of @xmath33 , appearance and a first precise determination of the oscillation parameters .",
    "the reactor experiment kamland , running at the solar @xmath34 scale , reported evidence for disappearance @xcite in perfect agreement with the solar data .",
    "a combined analysis of solar plus reactor data shows that the most likely channel is a transition of @xmath35 into other active flavors ( @xmath33 and @xmath23 ) whose oscillation probability is modulated by @xmath36 , central values are @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "a further indication of @xmath39 oscillations with a @xmath34 of @xmath40 comes from the beam dump lsnd experiment detecting a @xmath41 excess of   interactions in a neutrino beam produced by @xmath42 decays at rest where the   component is highly suppressed ( @xmath43 ) @xcite .",
    "the karmen experiment @xcite , with a very similar technique but with a lower sensitivity ( a factor 10 less for the lower @xmath44 ) , and the nomad experiment at wanf of cern sps @xcite ( for @xmath45 ev@xmath32 ) do not confirm the result , excluding a large part of the allowed region of the oscillation parameters .",
    "the lsnd result does nt fit the overall picture of neutrino oscillations and several non - standard explanations , as for instance sterile neutrinos , have been put forward to solve this experimental conflict .",
    "the miniboone experiment at fnal , presently taking data , is designed to settle this puzzle with a @xmath46 sensitivity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath47mixing angle represents the link between the solar and the atmospheric neutrino oscillations : both solar and atmospheric neutrino data are compatible with @xmath48 within the experimental sensitivity .",
    "the best experimental constraint to @xmath47comes from the reactor experiment chooz @xcite : @xmath49 at 90 % c.l . for @xmath50 ev@xmath32 .",
    "the measurement of the mixing angle parameters can be performed in long - baseline oscillation experiments with suitable neutrino beams produced at accelerators , since this technique offers a better control over the neutrino flux .",
    "in particular three parameters , which are still to be measured , the mixing angle @xmath47 , the cp phase @xmath51and @xmath22can be determined by detecting sub - leading @xmath52   oscillations , as discussed in section [ section : numunue ] .",
    "over the next five years the present generation of oscillation experiments at accelerators with long - baseline @xmath53 beams ( table  [ tab : beams1 ] ) , k2k at kek @xcite , minos @xcite at the numi beam from fnal @xcite and icarus @xcite and opera @xcite at the cngs beam from cern @xcite are expected to confirm the atmospheric evidence of oscillations and measure @xmath54 and @xmath55 within @xmath56 % of accuracy if @xmath57 ev@xmath32 .",
    "k2k and minos are looking for neutrino disappearance , by measuring the @xmath53 survival probability as a function of neutrino energy while icarus and opera will search for evidence of @xmath58 interactions in a @xmath53 beam , the final proof of @xmath59oscillations .",
    "k2k has already completed its data taking at the end of 2004 , while minos has started data taking beginning 2005 .",
    "cngs is expected to start operations in the second half of 2006 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the neutrino production by muon decay from a pure muon beam has been considered since 1998 @xcite : this is indeed a perfectly well known weak process and the @xmath60 beam can be well measured in momentum and intensity .    in the cern present layout for a neutrino factory ( @xmath61f )",
    "@xcite a 4 mw proton beam is accelerated up to 2.2 gev / c by the super conducting proton linac ( spl ) to produce low energy @xmath62 s in a liquid mercury target , which are collected by a solenoid .",
    "muons produced from the @xmath62-decay are then cooled and phase rotated before acceleration through a recirculating linac system up to 50 gev / c .",
    "these muons of well defined charge and momentum are injected in the @xmath60 accumulator where they will circulate until they decay , delivering along the two main straight sections two pure @xmath61 beams whose intensity is expected more than 100 times the one in conventional beams .",
    "both muon signs can be selected .",
    "the decay @xmath63 @xmath64 produces a pure well collimated neutrino beam with equal numbers of @xmath65 @xmath66 and their energy allows to extend the baseline to several thousand kilometers of distance .    -0.3 cm    the optimal beam energy at the @xmath61f will be as large as possible accounting for the difficulties and the technical challenge for the construction of such a muon accelerator complex .",
    "@xmath67 gev ( @xmath68 34 gev ) represents a limit value for such a new machine .",
    "in fact the neutrino flux @xmath69 grows like @xmath70 ( in the conventional neutrino beams @xmath69 is proportional to @xmath71 ) ; the number of charged current neutrino events from the oscillations ( @xmath72 ) , measured by a detector at a distance l , will be proportional to @xmath71 :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the corresponding neutrino interaction cross - section and @xmath75 is the oscillation probability .    furthermore , the @xmath61 intensity can be precisely determined from the measurement of the monochromatic @xmath60 current circulating in the storage ring ( absolute normalization at @xmath76 level ) .",
    "an accurate determination of @xmath60 momentum allows for the measurement of the neutrino energy spectra at the detector site .",
    "the @xmath61f lends itself naturally to the exploration of neutrino oscillations between @xmath61 flavors with high sensitivity to small mixing angles and small mass differences .",
    "the detector should be able to perform both appearance and disappearance experiments , providing lepton identification and charge discrimination which is a tag for the initial flavor and of the oscillation .",
    "in particular the search for @xmath77 transitions (  golden channel \" ) appears to be very attractive at @xmath61f , because this transition can be studied in appearance mode looking for @xmath78 ( appearance of wrong - sign @xmath60 ) in neutrino beams where the neutrino type that is searched for is totally absent ( @xmath79 beam in @xmath61f ) . with a 40 kt magnetic detector",
    "( minos like ) exposed to both polarity beams and @xmath80 muon decays , it will be possible to explore the @xmath47 angle down to @xmath81 opening the possibility to measure the @xmath82 phase if @xmath83 ev@xmath32 ( systematic errors not accounted for ) @xcite .    unfortunately , as discussed in section  [ section : numunue ] , the determination of ( @xmath84 ) is not free of ambiguities and up to eight different regions of the parameter space can fit the same experimental result .    in order to solve these ambiguities , a single experiment on a single neutrino beam",
    "is not enough .",
    "an optimal combination of @xmath13-beams , superbeams and neutrino factories has to be considered to deal with the eightfold degeneracy .",
    "several investigations on how to solve this problem have been carried out , as reported in  @xcite and references therein . as an example",
    "the result of such an analysis combining the golden and the silver ( @xmath85 ) @xmath61f channels with the spl - sb , taken from reference @xcite , is shown if fig .",
    "[ super ] .",
    "more details on the physics performances of a @xmath61f towards a precision measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters can be found in refs .",
    "neutrino oscillations are certainly one of the most important discoveries of the recent years . they allow to measure fundamental parameters of the standard model , provide the first insight beyond the electroweak scale , play a decisive role in many fields of astrophysics and cosmology and allow to explore cp violation in the leptonic sector .",
    "the precise measurements of the oscillation parameters and of the still unknown parameters @xmath47 , @xmath22and @xmath51 in the subleading @xmath52 oscillations in particular appear as a must in high energy physics .",
    "the present generation of neutrino beams at accelerators like numi and cngs can start the exploration of the @xmath47 angle beyond the chooz limit .",
    "however , power and purity of these conventional neutrino beams , where neutrinos are generated mainly by pion and kaon decays in a wide range of momenta , seem to limit intrinsically the experimental sensitivity .",
    "new high intensity proton accelerator facilities ( in the mwatt regime ) are required to produce neutrino beams with an intensity and purity much higher than the conventional neutrino beams .",
    "novel concept neutrino beams like betabeams and neutrino factories , where neutrinos are produced in the decay of radiocative ions and muons respectively , suitable accelerated to a selected momentum , can open new interesting and promising scenarios given the possibility to explore the neutrino oscillation world with high accuracy .",
    "these new facilities are under study .",
    "they will require a long r&d phase with different time - scales due to the different intrinsic difficulties involved in the projects and in the constructions .",
    "the most physics - ambitious road - map is still to be clarified also because no predictions exist for the @xmath47parameter , below the chooz limit @xmath86 , that drives all the new phenomena .",
    "the t2k experiment in japan at the j - parc accelerator complex , using super - kamiokande as far detector , appears as a reference point in the search , well corroborated by the possibility of a second phase with a more intense beam and a larger detector of about one megaton mass .",
    "the option cern to gran sasso neutrino superbeam based on improved synchrotron seems to be equivalent to j - parc ii , as far as concerns neutrino fluxes , except for @xmath35 level due to the off - axis alignment of j - parc .",
    "however , it is mandatory to complement it with a detector in excess of 100 kton mass to exploit its physics potential well beyond the t2k sensitivity .",
    "the spl - superbeam project at cern , complemented with a megaton water cerenkov detector , seems to require a too big effort compared with its physics output , even if the 3.5 gev spl option greatly improves its discovery potential .",
    "a gigantic water cerenkov detector would be better exploited if fired by a betabeam , and it should be stressed that a combination of the spl - sb with a betabeam results to be the most powerful facility proposed before the neutrino factories era .",
    "smaller and denser detectors could be only used with betabeams of higher energies than that obtainable with the cern sps or , in a longer timescale , with the neutrino factories . here , iron calorimeters or liquid argon detectors exceeding 40 kton of mass , both magnetized in the case of neutrino factories , could reach excellent sensitivities in neutrino oscillation physics .",
