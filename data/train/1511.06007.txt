    "the extended radio emission observed in radio galaxies arises from plumes or lobes of magnetised plasma that are deposited by powerful jets ejected from the galactic nucleus .",
    "only a small fraction of the jet power is ultimately converted to synchrotron emission , with most of the jet energy being used to expand the lobes , drive shocks in the surrounding gas , and increase the amount of stored energy in the form of plasma internal energy and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the ratio of extended radio luminosity to jet power , @xmath6 , which we shall call the extended radiative efficiency , varies greatly between sources . measured at 1400 mhz ,",
    "the extended radiative efficiency ranges from @xmath7 ( cygnus a ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to @xmath8 ( ms0735.6 + 7421 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the extended radiative efficiency varies with the age of the source , and depends on the physical conditions within the lobes , as well as the evolutionary history of the radio galaxy @xcite , each of which depend on the external environment to some extent ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , the radio luminosity is not an accurate gauge of jet power in any individual object @xcite .",
    "however , the population of radio galaxies covers a range of more than 7 decades in radio luminosity , and on a population basis , the radio luminosity is expected to correlate strongly with the rate at which energy is deposited in the lobes . in principle , the scaling relation between radio luminosity and jet power can be a powerful tool in statistical studies of radio galaxies and their energetic impact on the surroundings , provided the scaling relation can be adequately calibrated .",
    "the @xmath9 scaling relation is typically assumed to be a power - law of the form @xmath10 which is often written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the jet power and @xmath13 is the monochromatic radio luminosity at frequency @xmath14 .",
    "a lot of effort has been devoted to calibrating this scaling relation , from both a theoretical and empirical point of view , as we now discuss .",
    "@xcite demonstrated a clear intrinsic correlation between the [ oii ] narrow line luminosity @xmath15 and monochromatic radio luminosity @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "taking @xmath15 as a proxy for accretion rate , and therefore jet power , @xcite argued that the observed @xmath18 correlation provides an empirical estimate of @xmath3 for frii radio galaxies .",
    "we further discuss the use of emission lines as a proxy for jet power , and in particular the shortcomings of such an approach , in section [ sec : emission_line_proxies ] .",
    "@xcite also presented a model - dependent predictor of jet power based on synchrotron minimum energy calculations in combination with the self - similar model of radio galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "they obtain an expression for the jet power @xmath19 (  w \" for willott ) in terms of the 151 mhz radio luminosity @xmath20 where @xmath19 is time averaged kinetic power of a source with radio luminosity @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the luminosity distance and @xmath23 is a parameter accounting for systematic error in the model assumptions .",

    ", the expression for @xmath19 above is widely used to estimate the mechanical output from agn based on a single low frequency luminosity measurement , assuming that the value of @xmath23 is constant ( typically of order 10 - 20 ) across the entire population of radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a number of empirical jet power measurement techniques have been employed to calibrate the @xmath9 scaling relation , and test the validity of equation [ eqn : willott ] .",
    "arguably the most direct measure of agn mechanical power is the so - called x - ray cavities method ( see section [ sec : cavities ] and references therein ) .",
    "this method relies on the detection of x - ray surface brightness depressions ( x - ray cavities ) associated with the extended radio lobes .",
    "the jet power is calculated based on the energy required to inflate the cavities .",

    "@xcite argued that their empirical relation is consistent with the model of @xcite ( equation [ eqn : willott ] ) , provided that the energy density of non - radiating particles in the lobes is 100 times that of the relativistic electron population .",

    "@xcite estimated the jet power for a sample of 31 high power frii radio galaxies , using the expression @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the lobe pressure calculated using minimum energy arguments , @xmath30 is the lobe volume assuming cylindrical symmetry , and @xmath31 is the spectral age of the source . using this method , @xcite found the scaling relation between jet power and radio luminosity in their sample to be consistent with the model prediction of @xcite ( equation [ eqn : willott ] ) , and also consistent with an extrapolation of the scaling relation for fri radio galaxies .",
    "these empirical calibrations of the @xmath9 scaling relation appear to be in broad agreement with each other , and also appear to support the model predictions of @xcite .",
    "however , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gs13 ) pointed out that due to the large difference in energy budget and dynamics of fri and frii radio galaxy lobes , the apparent agreement in the fri and frii scaling relations is entirely unexpected .",
    "it was argued by gs13 that the @xmath32 scaling relations should differ greatly between the two classes of object , in both slope and normalisation . in an effort to test this hypothesis",
    ", gs13 devised a new method for measuring jet power in frii radio galaxies based on the observed hotspot parameters . using this new method with a sample of 29 3c frii radio galaxies",
    ", it was found that the @xmath9 scaling relation agreed with the model predictions of @xcite as well as the empirical results of @xcite for frii radio galaxies , and was strikingly similar to that obtained for fri radio galaxies by @xcite , despite expectations to the contrary .",
    "the agreement between the scaling relations in gs13 appeared to confirm the previously held position that @xmath19 ( equation [ eqn : willott ] ) could be applied to the entire radio galaxy population , regardless of source morphology , environment , or jet power .",
    "however , this conclusion was erroneous : here we show that the apparent agreement between the various empirically derived scaling relations is due to the similar distance dependence of jet power measurement techniques used for fri and frii radio galaxies . in each case described above , except for the study of @xcite , the effect of distance has been neglected .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a re - analysis of the previously reported scaling relations for fri and frii radio galaxies , accounting for the distance dependence in jet power measurements .",
    "as already mentioned , there is a large intrinsic scatter in the relationship between jet power and radio luminosity from source to source .",
    "therefore , to enable precise calibration of the average scaling relation , it is necessary to use samples that cover a broad range in luminosity and jet power . in the case of @xcite ,",
    "for example , the sample covers 6 dex in radio luminosity and 5 dex in jet power .",
    "however , to cover a such broad range in physical parameters , the sample necessarily spans a very wide range in distance .",
    "the samples are therefore subject to malmquist bias .",
    "when spanning a large range in distance , this can potentially result in a spurious relationship between jet power and radio luminosity , which is driven by the common distance dependence on both axes in the sample ( eg . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this spurious relation can dominate over any intrinsic relationship between the variables , or can produce a strong apparent correlation when no intrinsic relation exists .    in section [ sec :",

    "the amount of work required to create the observed cavities provides a measure of the total mechanical energy produced by the agn .",
    "this estimate of total mechanical energy , when combined with an estimate of the age of the radio galaxy outburst , provides a measurement of the time averaged jet power @xcite : @xmath33 the pre - factor @xmath34 depends on the equation of state of the plasma within the cavity , as well as the expansion history of the bubble , but is typically taken to be @xmath35 @xcite .",

    "by comparing the cavity power and radio luminosity in a large sample of x - ray cavity systems , it is possible to determine a scaling relationship between jet power and radio luminosity @xcite .",
    "however , the sample necessarily consists entirely of systems with detected x - ray cavities , which introduces a strong selection bias that is manifested as a tight relationship between jet power and distance in the sample . in section [ sec : expected_cavities_distance_dependence ]",
    "we derive the distance dependence of cavity power measurements . in section [ sec : cavities_sample ] we discuss the x - ray cavities sample and the uncertainty calculations . in section [ sec : cavities_regression ] we present our data analysis and results .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : model_predictions ] we derive a model to determine the expected scaling relation for fri x - ray cavity systems .      in order to demonstrate the distance dependence of the x - ray cavity jet power measurements , we consider the simple case of a cavity in an isothermal gas at temperature @xmath36 with a @xmath37-model density distribution ( king atmosphere ) of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the core radius and @xmath40 is the central density that provides the normalisation for the density distribution , and @xmath41 is the exponent of the power - law density profile . for a given temperature , the x - ray surface brightness @xmath42 as a function of angular distance from the centre can be written as @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the electron and proton density at a clustercentric radius @xmath46 , respectively , and",
    "@xmath47 is the angular diameter distance .",

    "hence , @xmath57 from equations [ eqn : cavity_power_1 ] , [ eqn : p_d_a ] , [ eqn : v_d_a ] and [ eqn : t_buoy_d_a ] we find @xmath58 samples of x - ray cavity systems typically include only low redshift radio galaxies , so the factor @xmath59 has a small effect on the distance dependence .",
    "therefore , given a sample of objects with a narrow range of observational properties ( i.e. x - ray surface brightness distribution , cavity angular size , cavity angular offset from the centre of the hot atmosphere , and radio flux density ) relative to the range in distance squared , the distance dependence of @xmath60 and @xmath61 will induce a spurious relationship @xmath62 . the narrow range in the observed parameters result from various selection effects in combination with the steep radio and kinetic luminosity functions .",
    "some of the selection effects are not obvious , for example , the scale of the cavities can not be very large relative to the core radius in the density profile ( @xmath39 in equation [ eqn : density_profile ] ) , due to the lack of signal to noise for a detection of the x - ray cavity @xcite .",

    "the only exception to these rules are m84 and m87 , for which distances have been measured using the surface brightness fluctuation method with the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , and are deemed to be accurate to @xmath71 @xcite .",

    "bearing in mind the caveats described above , this may suggest a steeper relation between jet power and radio luminosity for friis than we find for fri x - ray cavity systems . as discussed in section [ sec : model_predictions ] , such a difference in the regression slope for fri and frii systems is expected , due to the difference in dynamics of the radio lobes .",
    "the relationship between jet power and radio luminosity depends largely on the source dynamics . @xcite",
    "developed a model - dependent predictor of jet power for frii radio galaxies based on the self - similar model of frii radio galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "the self - similar model is applicable to powerful frii radio galaxies in which the over - pressured lobes drive a strong bow - shock into the interstellar or intergalactic medium .",
    "in contrast , for x - ray cavity systems it is typically assumed that the expansion rate is subsonic , and is dictated by the buoyant velocity , which is not dependent on the jet power @xcite .",
    "the different dynamics of fri and frii radio galaxies implies a different scaling relation between jet power and radio luminosity , as we now show .",
    "we begin with the following statement , which is the basis of x - ray cavity jet power measurements , and is equivalent to equation 4 of @xcite : @xmath143 where h is the cavity enthalpy which accounts for the pv work done in expanding the cavity as well as the internal energy of the system .",

    "it is often assumed that @xmath35 , as appropriate for mature cavity systems in which the radio lobes are dominated by relativistic plasma @xcite , but @xmath34 could be significantly higher in some cases if expansion is supersonic ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "the pressure within the cavity is the sum of contributions from thermal particles @xmath144 , relativistic particles @xmath145 , and magnetic field @xmath146 : @xmath147 .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is isotropically distributed (  tangled \" ) on all scales , and therefore can be treated as a pressure term with effective pressure @xmath148 @xcite . in that case",

    "@xmath156 is a function of @xmath150 , and involves several physical constants @xcite .",
    "let us define @xmath157 , then ignoring physical constants and terms involving only the spectral index @xmath150 , we can write @xmath158 now let us parameterise the radio lobe dynamics as follows @xmath159 combining equations [ eqn : q_i ] and [ eqn : t ] we can write @xmath160 where , for @xmath161 : @xmath162 in the special case @xmath163 the jet power is independent of luminosity ( at a fixed volume ) , and in that case @xmath164 this case may be of particular relevance to fri radio galaxies , and is discussed further below .",
    "models of frii radio lobe dynamics have typically assumed that the lobe internal pressure is much greater than the external pressure of the ambient medium into which the lobes expand , resulting in supersonic , self - similar expansion @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the lobes evolve according to @xcite : @xmath165 so that @xmath166 and @xmath167 , where _ b _ is the exponent of the power - law density profile @xmath168 .",

    "estimates of the internal pressure of frii radio galaxy lobes suggest that they may be close to pressure equilibrium with the external medium , rather than significantly over pressured as is required for supersonic , self - similar evolution @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of axial ratios of frii radio galaxies is dependent on linear size , with larger sources tending to have larger axial ratios @xcite .",
    "this is at odds with self - similar models , in which the lobes remain over - pressured with respect to the external medium , and the axial ratio remains constant throughout the life of a source @xcite .",
    "we note that new dynamical models which include steepening of the gas density profiles with radius and thermal pressure of the ambient medium can explain the observed increase in the axial ratio of frii radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "if the lobes of frii radio galaxies do not evolve according to the self - similar models , the @xmath9 scaling relation is expected to differ from that described by @xcite , and will depend on the values of @xmath172 and @xmath173 as described by equations [ eqn : q_ii ] and [ eqn : beta_l ] .",
    "the dynamics of fri radio galaxy lobes may differ significantly for high and low power objects , and are likely to differ from that of powerful frii radio galaxies . in this section",
    ", we discuss the variety of predictions for fri lobe dynamics , and highlight the effect of the differing dynamics on the predicted @xmath9 scaling relation .    based on the torus - like appearance of the radio lobes of m87",
    ", @xcite suggested that the lobe dynamics are dictated by buoyancy , in which case , the lobe expansion is independent of jet power .",
    "the assumption of buoyant bubble - like dynamics is often applied to x - ray cavity systems . while this is not true very early in the evolution of a radio source",
    ", it may be a good approximation for mature systems , like those that are preferentially detected in the x - ray cavities sample @xcite , and therefore may provide a reasonable model for the evolution of the systems in question .",
    "however , see @xcite for an alternative view . indeed , for fri x - ray cavity systems , the source ages are often derived based on buoyant velocity estimates ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "if the dynamics are dictated by buoyancy , the source evolution is independent of jet power , and @xmath174 , in which case @xmath175 for typical values of @xmath170 , the exponent relating @xmath12 and @xmath13 is @xmath176 .",
    "such a model may be valid for low power fri radio galaxies .",
    "however , the evolution of more powerful fri radio galaxies is unlikely to be well described by the buoyant bubble models .",
    "powerful fri x - ray cavity systems such as ms0735 + 7421 @xcite and hydra a @xcite show evidence for weak shocks surrounding the radio lobes , indicating the evolution of these systems is jet driven .",
    "in such systems , whilst the evolution will have some dependence on jet power , the dependence may be weaker than the case of highly supersonic , self - similar expansion , and as such , the implied @xmath177 may lie somewhere between that corresponding to a buoyantly rising bubble ( @xmath178 ) and that corresponding to supersonic , self - similar expansion ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "alternative models for fri lobe dynamics have been proposed .",
    "for example @xcite present a so - called  pressure - limiting \" expansion model . in this model ,",
    "the lobes evolve according to @xmath180 where , again , @xmath41 is the exponent of the power - law density profile of the ambient medium .",
    "therefore , in this model @xmath181 and the jet power is independent of luminosity ( for a given source size ) .      as shown in the preceding analysis , assuming @xmath182 , the predicted regression slope is @xmath183 for all @xmath161 , and @xmath184 for @xmath163 .",
    "our empirically derived regression slope for the x - ray cavity sample ( @xmath90 ) is inconsistent with any model predictions : no dynamical model can produce such a flat regression slope .",
    "this implies that one or more of the additional model parameters ( @xmath185 ) are correlated with jet power in this sample in such a way that acts to flatten the observed regression slope , or the x - ray cavity jet powers contain a systematic bias , such that the jet power is underestimated in high power objects and/or jet power is overestimated in low power objects .",
    "we discuss each of these possibilities in more detail below .",
    "we might expect that the value of @xmath154 ( the ratio of pressure in non - radiating particles to the pressure in radiating particles ) is anti - correlated with jet power , since weaker jets are likely to suffer more significant effects of entrainment @xcite .",
    "indeed , within the fri radio galaxies population , lower radio luminosities are typically associated with naked jet sources whilst the high luminosity end is dominated by lobed fri radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "naked jet sources typically have higher @xmath154 values than lobed fris @xcite .    additionally , unlike in the case of the self - similar dynamical model for frii radio galaxies , the dependence of jet power on source size is not negligible . considering the case of a buoyant bubble model ,",
    "if the bubble expansion is adiabatic , and the bubble rises at a constant velocity in a power - law pressure profile of the form @xmath186 then in equation [ eqn : n_v ] the exponent becomes @xmath187 where typically @xmath188 , and @xmath189 is the adiabatic index of the external medium , so that @xmath190 .",
    "source volumes in the x - ray cavities sample are correlated with jet power , due to the common distance dependence , and so this effect will tend to flatten the @xmath32 scaling relation for this sample .    finally , the discrepancy may be due to a systematic bias in the x - ray cavity power measurements .",
    "@xcite outline several sources of potential bias and uncertainty that could affect the accuracy of x - ray cavity estimates of jet power .",
    "importantly , x - ray cavity powers neglect the energy associated with shocks .",
    "shocks are likely to be more important for higher power objects @xcite , and therefore neglecting the energy in shocks may introduce a systematic bias in the x - ray cavity powers , underestimating the jet power of higher power sources , which would result in a flatter regression slope relative to the predicted value .",
    "what is the average relation ( if any ) between jet power and radio luminosity in radio galaxies ?",
    "do high and low power radio galaxies follow the same relation ? we have addressed these questions from both an empirical and theoretical point of view .",
    "our results may be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the three methods previously used to calibrate the @xmath9 scaling relation have a strong dependence on distance , each with @xmath60 .",
    "the mutual distance dependence induces a spurious relation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the similar distance dependence for each of the jet power measurement techniques accounts for the apparent similarity of previously reported scaling relations for fri and frii radio galaxies . 2 .   for fri x - ray cavity systems ,",
    "after accounting for the mutual distance dependence , we find a very weak correlation between jet power and radio luminosity , with @xmath191 where @xmath90 at 327  mhz and @xmath91 at 1400  mhz .",
    "3 .   for powerful frii",
    "radio galaxies , after accounting for the mutual distance dependence , we find no evidence for an intrinsic relationship between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , the lack of evidence of an intrinsic correlation does not necessarily imply that there is no intrinsic correlation , simply that the samples do not span enough range in distance - normalised parameter space to accurately constrain the intrinsic relation .",
    "4 .   proxies for jet power such as the x - ray , infra - red or narrow emission line luminosities of the agn , indicate that the scaling relation for frii radio galaxies may be significantly steeper than that obtained for fris .",
    "however , the uncertain non - linear relationships between accretion related emission and jet power means that an accurate empirical calibration of the scaling relation for friis is not possible with this approach .",
    "the broad range in regression slopes obtained when using different proxies for jet power demonstrates the difficulties faced in using agn related emission to calibrate the scaling relation .",
    "5 .   from a theoretical point of view",
    ", we have shown that the different dynamics of fri and frii radio galaxy lobes implies a difference in the expected @xmath9 scaling relation . taking the common assumption that the dynamics of x - ray cavity systems are similar to a buoyantly rising bubble , such that the evolution is dictated by the external environment , we predict for these systems @xmath192 .",
    "in contrast , frii systems evolve on a jet driven timescale , which results in a prediction of @xmath193 , as first described by @xcite .",
    "the flatter slope for fri radio galaxies relative to frii radio galaxies is consistent with our conclusion in point ( iv ) .",
    "we note however that to achieve a flat regression slope @xmath92 , additional model parameters must be correlated with jet power in such a way as to flatten the observed scaling relation , or there must be a systematic bias in x - ray cavity jet powers such that the jet power is underestimated in high luminosity objects and/or jet power is overestimated in low luminosity objects .",
    "finally , we repeat the arguments of gs13 regarding the relative scaling relations of fri and frii radio galaxies .",
    "results from the analysis of radio galaxies and their hot x - ray emitting atmospheres suggest that non - radiating particles dominate the energy budget in the lobes of fr i radio galaxies , in some cases by a factor of more than 1000 @xcite , while radiating particles dominate the energy budget in fr ii radio galaxy lobes @xcite .",
    "this implies a significant difference in the radiative efficiency of the two morphological classes , which would manifest as a large difference in the normalisation of the @xmath9 scaling relations .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath9 scaling relations remain poorly constrained through observations .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainty regarding radio lobe dynamics provides some uncertainty in the predicted scaling relations .",
    "however , our analysis indicates that fri and frii radio galaxies do not follow the same scaling relation between jet power and radio luminosity : the regression slope for fri x - ray cavity systems is significantly flatter than previously reported , with @xmath194 at 327 mhz .",
    "this revision in the scaling relation gives a greater energetic importance to low luminosity radio galaxies , which has strong implications for studies of radio mode feedback .",
    "low luminosity radio galaxies typically deposit energy at smaller radii than more powerful systems , because they do not expand to 100 kpc sizes . as such",
    ", low power radio galaxies may be more effective at offsetting cooling in hot atmospheres of massive galaxies , groups and clusters by depositing more energy in the regions where it is most needed to offset cooling .",
    "+ dynamical models ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and simulations ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will help to predict more accurately the @xmath9 relation as a function of the radio source morphology , environment , cosmic epoch , and host galaxy history .",
    "this will provide a framework for interpreting data for next - generation continuum surveys from lofar , askap , mwa , meerkat and the square kilometre array .",
