    "a major goal of the field of strong - interaction physics is to determine the spectrum of hadrons and nuclei from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "lattice qcd is the only known way to rigorously compute strong - interaction quantities , and as such , an increasing effort is being put into understanding the lattice qcd calculations that will be required to extract even the most basic properties of light nuclei .",
    "ground - state hadron masses , including those of nuclei , can be extracted from the long - time exponential behavior of a two - point correlation function with the appropriate quantum numbers in euclidean space .",
    "excited states that are stable against strong decays , such as the low - lying energy levels of nuclei , can be extracted from the time - dependence of correlation functions over a large time interval with various methods , such as those described in ref .",
    "by contrast , excited states that are unstable against strong decays can be extracted by analyzing the volume dependence of the energies of the scattering states  @xcite .",
    "however , such direct calculations of the masses of nuclei beyond @xmath3 appear computationally prohibitive using current lattice techniques .",
    "consequently , the properties of nuclei , beyond the lightest few , will likely be systematically determined by matching lattice qcd onto nuclear effective field theories ( neft s )  .",
    "lattice qcd calculations of few nucleon systems will be used to constrain the low - energy constants ( lecs ) appearing in the neft , which will then be used to compute the properties of larger nuclei . to extend calculations to larger nuclei , further matchings ( for example to the no - core shell model  @xcite ) will be required .",
    "the most important lecs relate to the interactions in the two - body sector , characterized by the effective - range expansion of the two - particle phase shift .",
    "these contributions ( at the physical pion mass ) are well constrained by experiment , but can also be determined using lattice qcd .",
    "recent work has used the volume dependence  @xcite of two nucleon  @xcite and hyperon - nucleon  @xcite systems to extract the corresponding two - body low - energy phase shifts at specific momenta from fully - dynamical mixed - action lattice calculations ( domain - wall valence quarks on fourth - rooted staggered configurations generated by the milc collaboration ) . in principle , phase shifts for all momenta below inelastic thresholds can be determined from qcd given sufficient computational resources .    in order to perform neft computations in systems of more than two nucleons , @xmath4 ,",
    "it is necessary to include the multi - nucleon interactions , such as the three - body force .",
    "the leading , local three - body interaction is a momentum - independent contact operator , @xmath5 ^ 3 $ ] , where @xmath6 is the renormalization scale ( which we will discuss subsequently ) , and @xmath7 is the nucleon annihilation operator .",
    "a determination of the coupling @xmath8 from lattice qcd will require the study of three - nucleon systems .",

    ", we compute the ground - state energy of @xmath0 identical bosons in a finite cubic volume with short - range repulsive two - body interactions , subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this system was first investigated for hard spheres by huang and yang @xcite , and we extend their results to include order @xmath2 contributions in the volume expansion , where the two - body effective range and three - body interactions first enter .",
    "for the case of three hard - spheres , our result agrees with that of wu  @xcite ( modulo renormalization issues and the appearance of a three - body interaction ) . while our results are not directly relevant to the study of nuclei , they are necessary for extracting the three - boson interaction in the study of multi - boson systems ( for instance multi - pion systems ) .",
    "motivated by interest in performing lattice qcd calculations , we calculate the ground - state energy of @xmath0 bosons of mass @xmath9 confined to a finite volume of size @xmath10 with periodic boundary conditions   in non - relativistic quantum mechanics . in their classic 1957 paper , huang and yang  @xcite",

    "only two - particle interactions contribute to the @xmath0-body ground - state energy and the results of ref .",

    "since the interaction of three particles due to the two - body interaction first enters at @xmath11 , and relativistic effects in such interactions are suppressed by @xmath62 , the first relativistic effects will occur at @xmath63 .",

    "a number of other effects are also important :    * higher partial waves will contribute to the ground - state energy at finite volume .",

    "* it is straightforward to show that the leading , momentum - independent @xmath22-body operators contribute to the ground - state energy at @xmath69 , and therefore , the four - body local operator will first enter at order @xmath70 .",
    "it is obvious that the momentum - dependent @xmath22-body operators first enter two orders higher than the momentum - independent operators .",
    "for instance , contributions from the two - body shape parameters ( higher - order terms in the expansion of @xmath71 ) first occur at @xmath72 . * in the calculations that we have performed , the symmetrizations that are required to satisfy bose statistics are trivial . at higher orders in the expansion ,",
    "where multiple insertions of the two - body effective - range interaction occur , symmetrization of the intermediate states will have non - trivial consequences and calculations will become increasingly complicated .",
    "in this work we have computed the volume dependence of the ground - state energy of @xmath0 bosons in a cubic volume with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "knowledge of this dependence is necessary in order to establish a connection between lattice qcd calculations of @xmath0-boson systems in euclidean space and the multi - body interactions contributing to the properties of many - body systems in minkowski space .",
    "we conclude by highlighting a number of issues and possible extensions of this work :    * our results are easily generalized to asymmetric volumes . in the asymmetric case ,",
    "the integer sums that appear in the expressions for the ground - state energy will become dependent on the asymmetry parameters  @xcite ( for some asymmetries , one or more of these sums can vanish  @xcite ) .",
    "further , the reduced symmetry of the system forces derivative interactions and higher partial - wave interactions to enter at lower orders in the volume expansion  @xcite .",
    "* calculation of excited - state energies are straightforward and tedious . many contributions ( diagrams in the perturbative expansion ) that vanish in the calculation of the ground - state energy will no longer vanish , and the combinatoric factors become somewhat more complicated because of the symmetrization requirements . *",
    "our calculation of the ground - state energy of the @xmath0-boson system is an expansion whose terms depend parametrically on @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are positive integers .",
    "much of the discussion in the literature regarding collections of bosons concerns bose - condensed systems , with the results that are summarized in ref .",
    "it is clear that in the large-@xmath0 limit , relevant to the bose - condensed systems , this expansion fails , and as such , no direct connection between our calculation and bose - condensed systems can be made .",
    "* we have restricted ourselves to the case of repulsive interactions among the bosons .",
    "the reason for this is that for an attractive two - body interaction of sufficient strength , the ground - state will not be perturbatively close to @xmath0 non - interacting bosons but will , in fact , be a system of two - body ( or higher body ) bound states",
    ", e.g. one can imagine that for the three - body system the ground - state is a two - body bound state interacting with the third boson .",
    "the finite - volume behavior of the two - particle system with shallow ( compared to the inverse range of the underlying interaction ) bound states was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and subsequently numerically explored in ref .  @xcite . in such systems , the leading finite volume corrections have both power - law and exponential volume dependences , and are somewhat more complicated to analyze . * the expressions we have presented in this work form the basis for investigating @xmath76 correlation functions with isospin @xmath77 in lattice qcd . by forming well - defined ratios of correlation functions , as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) , the three - body interaction can be calculated .",
    "the natural choice of renormalization scale is the ultra - violet cutoff of the low - energy theory , which is approximately the range of the interaction , @xmath78 .",
    "this gives rise to a large logarithm , @xmath79 , which should formally dominate the @xmath2 contribution to the ground - state energy .",
    "* as the lattice - qcd study of nuclei is the underlying motivation for this work , it is worth considering difficulties that will be encountered in generalizing the result described here to fermionic systems .",
    "a significant difference between the three - neutron system and the three - boson system is that the pauli - exclusion principle forces the unperturbed ground state of three neutrons to have non - zero momentum .",
    "one of the neutrons will have momentum @xmath80 , which provides power - law volume dependence to the ground state even in the absence of interactions . as a result the momentum - dependent interactions will enter at lower orders than in the boson system .",
    "the lowest - energy state with zero total momentum consists of one neutron at rest , and the other two moving back - to - back , each with @xmath81 .      c.  michael , nucl .",
