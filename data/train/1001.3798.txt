    "the boost - rotation ( br ) symmetric solutions describe spatially bounded charged rotating objects undergoing a `` uniform acceleration '' ; they are asymptotically flat in the sense that they admit smooth though not complete null infinity .",

    "in our work @xcite , based upon the ehlers frame theory @xcite , we found physically plausible newtonian limits of the br symmetric solutions .",
    "what has to be done is to introduce the causality constant @xmath17 in the metric and choose suitable coordinate system .",
    "then in the limit @xmath18 the ehlers frame theory goes over to the newton - cartan theory where two distinct spatial and temporal metrics together with affine connection occur .",
    "the connection is then given by the newtonian potential @xmath19 as follows : @xmath20 .",
    "the next key point is to observe that even in special relativity the worldline of a uniformly accelerated particle is hyperbola @xmath21 .",
    "the whole hyperbola disappears to infinity in the limit @xmath18 and the acceleration horizon ( the `` roof ''  see ref . )",
    "becomes the hyperplane @xmath22 .",
    "hence , in order to obtain a nontrivial limit , we have to `` go '' to infinity with the particle .",
    "we do this by introducing a new coordinate @xmath23 by @xmath24 and so we make a @xmath25-dependent shift of @xmath26",

    "remarkably , complicated form ( for functions @xmath1 entering ( [ eq : brmetric ] ) see ref . ) of the c - metric leads to the simple classical potential of uniformly accelerated point particle with mass @xmath10 ( for similar results for other br symmetric spacetimes see ref . ) : @xmath29    for charged c - metric ( [ eq : rcmr ] ) global coordinates appropriate for a newtonian limit are not known",
    ". therefore we have to introduce suitable class of observers ( `` static observers at infinity '' )  using purely geometric formulation of the ehlers frame theory  and calculate the limit with respect to these observers .",
    "the newtonian limit then leads to charged massive point particle with standard newtonian potential and the electromagnetic field according to the newtonian limit of maxwell equations as introduced by kunzle@xcite .",
