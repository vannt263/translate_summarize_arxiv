    "another component of the system must have imparted some angular momentum .",
    "second , secondary stars can spin - up primary stars faster than the orbital period in the case of eccentric orbits .",
    "pseudosynchronous orbits are those that have the rotation of the star synchronized with the periastron passage of the secondary star @xcite .",
    "@xmath0  dra has a predicted pseudosynchronous rotation period of @xmath237  days @xcite , which is much longer than our observed rotational period .",
    "thus , the known companion of @xmath0  dra could not have spun up the system to its current rotational period .",
    "third , a now - unseen companion could have spun - up the primary star .",
    "because the secondary star has a mass of @xmath4 , the two objects that merged would have to have a significant difference in mass , otherwise the secondary star would be more evolved than the primary . with the primary and secondary stars falling on the same isochrone ,",
    "the component that merged into the primary must have been only a small fraction of primary mass so as to not significantly affect its evolution . in order be consistent with rotational velocity observations ,",
    "sufficient angular momentum would need to be imparted by the merging component to spin - up the @xmath238 convective envelope of the @xmath228 primary star .",
    "unfortunately , the rotation period of the star when the companion was engulfed is unknown and the primary star could have since slowed . while we can not accurately estimate the mass of the consumed companion , we find from angular momentum arguments that the companion could range in mass from a giant planet to a low - mass star .",
    "if a low - mass companion were initially present in the system at @xmath239  au , it would be dynamically stable with the system s stellar components on the timescale of the system age , @xmath231  gyr , but would be engulfed by the primary star as the evolving stellar radius approached the companion s orbital radius ( cf .",
    "in this work , we have made the first visual detections of the secondary star of @xmath0  dra using interferometric observations .",
    "the @xmath1-band primary - to - secondary flux ratio is @xmath98 , the highest confirmed flux ratio for a binary detected with long - baseline optical interferometry . with the astrometry and radial velocity data for both stars ,",
    "we establish the first full three - dimensional orbit to determine orbital and stellar parameters .    by folding and binning photometric data ,",
    "we have shown evidence of ellipsoidal variations , gravitational distortions of the primary star caused by the close companion .",
    "the observed light curves are nearly identical to light curve models generated only from stellar and orbital parameters leading to the conclusion that the primary star has ellipsoidal variations , as opposed to long - lived starspots or active longitudes . after removing the model light curve ,",
    "we observe only weak signs of rotationally - modulated starspots",
    ". additionally , there could be potentially active regions ( e.g. , axisymmetric spot structures and polar spots ) that affect the stellar flux over longer periods of time with a global brightening or dimming .",
    "the folded , binned light curve also shows primary and secondary eclipses , which provide flux ratios to help constrain the stellar parameters of the secondary star .",
    "our new , high - precision orbital elements along with the folded light curve also allow for a measurement of gravity darkening .",
    "we find that @xmath7 , a value of gravity darkening consistent with conventional theory @xcite and previous results @xcite .",
    "we have established that the primary star s rapid rotation period could be due to the transfer of angular momentum from a nearby companion . specifically , a low - mass companion in a @xmath239  au orbit would impart sufficient angular momentum to spin - up the outer stellar layers before being engulfed as the star ascended the giant branch while not dramatically altering the stellar evolution .    in this series of papers , we have demonstrated that precision interferometry at chara is capable of detecting the faint main - sequence companions of bright rs cvn primary stars .",
