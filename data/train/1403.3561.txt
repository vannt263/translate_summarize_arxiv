    "star clusters have long been key objects to reconstruct the formation and the dynamical and chemical evolutions of galaxies . as the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is considered , the study of its star cluster population has allowed us to learn about its spread in metallicity at the very early epoch @xcite ; the existence of a relatively important gap in its age distribution @xcite ; the evidence of vigorous star cluster formation episodes @xcite ; the complexity of the cluster formation rate during the last million years @xcite , etc .",
    "although somewhat inhomogeneous and clearly still incomplete , the astrophysical properties estimated for a significant number of lmc star clusters have been the starting point to address galactic global issues such as the age - metallicity relationship and the cluster formation rate , among others .",
    "therefore , it results of great importance to enlarge the number of objects confirmed as genuine star clusters and to estimate their fundamental parameters .    with the aim of providing mainly with age and metallicity estimates for an increasing number of lmc star clusters",
    ", we have continued a long term observational program carried out at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) using different telescopes in conjunction with ccd cameras and the washington photometric filters @xcite .",
    "a total of 61 clusters have been observed and their fundamental parameters estimated ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "more recently , we took advantage of a wealth of available images at the national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) science data management ( sdm ) archives , obtained at the ctio 4-m blanco telescope with the mosaic ii camera attached ( 36@xmath636 arcmin@xmath7 field with a 8k@xmath68k ccd detector array , scale 0.274@xmath1/pixel ) and the washington filters . from the whole volume of observed lmc fields",

    "* ) we identified 206 clusters previously catalogued by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter b08 ) , and studied 107 of them with some detail @xcite . in this work",
    ", we end up the series of studies of unkown or poorly - known lmc clusters with available washington photometry by analysing the remaining objects in the aforementioned sample .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : washington @xmath8 data are presented in section 2 . the star cluster sample is described in section 3 , while the cleaning of the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and the estimation of the cluster ages are presented in sections 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "we discuss the results and build cluster frequencies in section 6 .",
    "finally , conclusions of this analysis are given in section 7 .",
    "the washington @xmath8 photometric data set used in this work were obtained from an comprehensive process that involved the reduction of the raw images , the determination of the instrumental photometric magnitudes , and the standardisation of the photometry .",
    "we have already described in detail such steps not only in the works cited above , but also in @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we summarise here some specific issues in order to provide the reader with an overview of the photometry quality .",
    "the data come from observations carried out on the nights of dec .",
    "18 - 20 , 2008 through the ctio 2008b-0192 program ( pi : d. geisler ) .",
    "the nights resulted to be of excellent photometric quality -with a typical seeing of @xmath0 1@xmath1 ( see table 1 of * ? ? ? * ) - as judged by the rms errors from the transformation to the standard system ( @xmath0 0.02 mag in each filter ) . from extensive artificial star tests we showed that the 50@xmath3 completeness level is located at @xmath9 @xmath0 23.5 - 24.5 mag and @xmath10 @xmath0 23.0 - 24.0 mag , depending on the crowding and exposure time ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the photometric errors in the @xmath10 mag increase typically from @xmath11 @xmath4 0.01 mag for the @xmath10 range @xmath0 16.0 - 20.0 mags up to @xmath11 @xmath0 0.20 mag for @xmath10 = 24.0 mag .",
    "the errors for the @xmath12 mags resulted in @xmath13 @xmath4 0.01 for the @xmath10 range @xmath0 16.0 - 19.0 mags and increases exponentially up to @xmath11 @xmath0 0.30 mag for @xmath10 = 24.0 mag .",
    "we here analyse cluster cmds down to @xmath10 @xmath0 22.0 mag , which corresponds to a completeness level nearly 100% and photometric errors @xmath11 @xmath4 0.05 mag .",
    "thus , our photometry yield accurate morphology and position of the main features in the observed cmds of the studied fields .",
    "1 shows a schematic chart with the distribution of the cluster candidates catalogued by b08 ( dots ) and the positions of the mosaic ii fields wherein the objects studied here are located ( boxes ) .",
    "some of the clusters placed within these mosaic ii fields have been previously studied by different authors @xcite , while others have been discarded from this analysis since their photometric data are not complete due to the presence of saturated stars in their images ( bsdl351 , 349 , 1980 , h88 - 267 , 308 , kmhk1274 , hs81 , ogle308 , and sl360 ) .",
    "the final cluster candidate sample studied here contains 90 objects .    according to b08 s catalogue",
    "the objects under study are of small angular dimension , typically with radius between @xmath0 8@xmath1 and 19@xmath1 with an average of 11@xmath1 . considering the lmc regions traced by @xcite , some clusters appear projected towards the densest 30 doradus , the bar , and the outer bar regions , while others are distributed within the north - west void and the north - west arm , which are less crowded .",
    "all these substructures are within the so - called inner lmc disc ( r @xmath14 4 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , many of the tiny selected objects are apparently composed by a handful of stars , which makes them of very low contrast over the background stellar density .",
    "the clusters included in this study were first recognised by overplotting the positions of those catalogued by b08 to the deepest mosaic ii @xmath15 images , thus avoiding to mismatch the observed objects and the actual list of catalogued clusters .",
    "we thus assigned to the observed clusters the respective names taken from b08 .",
    "we searched for the same names in the digital sky survey ( dss ) and downloaded 15@xmath16@xmath615@xmath16 @xmath17 images centred on the coordinates matched by the dss .",
    "we used the simbad astronomical database as an additional source for checking the cluster coordinates .",
    "when comparing the dss extracted regions with the observed cluster fields in the @xmath8 images , we could confirm the positions of our selected targets . notice that , since most of the observed objects are of small angular size and many of them are projected towards relatively crowded fields with stellar density fluctuations , the task of distinguishing a star cluster from a chance grouping of stars was not at all straightforward .",
    "table 1 contains a complete list of the recognized objects .",
    "in general terms , the observed cmds of the selected objects are the result of the superposition of different stellar populations distributed along the line - of - sight . for this reason , the use of the observed cmds without subtracting the luminosity function and",
    "the colour distribution of stars belonging to the field might lead to wrong interpretations .",
    "moreover , since the catalogued clusters have been identified as small star concentrations on the basis of a stellar density fluctuation in the sky , their real physical nature require a subsequent confirmation . in most of the cases we probably deal with the presence of a genuine star cluster ,",
    "while in other cases it might constitute a chance grouping of stars or the effect of a non - uniform distribution of the interstellar material in that surveyed region . in order to disentangle cluster stars from field stars , it is required to employ cmds of adjacent fields to subtract the local lmc field luminosity function and colour distribution .",
    "we built cluster cmds from all the measured stars distributed within a circle of radius three times those of the clusters .",
    "for this purpose we used the radii ( r ) listed in table 1 , which were obtained from visual inspection of the objects in the deepest @xmath8 images .",
    "they are large enough as to reach the observed field star region .",
    "notice that our main aim consists in cleaning the cluster cmds from the contamination of field stars within areas around the clusters centres nine times larger than @xmath18r@xmath7 , so that we did not need to trace their radial profiles .",
    "once the cluster areas were delineated , we traced four additional regions with areas equals to the cluster regions and placed more or less equidistant to the clusters centres around the cluster circular areas . from each surrounding region",
    "we built a cmd which shows the features of the local lmc star field towards that particular direction .",
    "we then apply a procedure that compares each one of the field cmds to the cluster cmd and subtract from the latter a representative field cmd in terms of stellar density , luminosity function and colour distribution .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details concerning this decontamination method .",
    "each resultant representative field cmd is built from scanning the individual one using cells that vary in size , thus achieving a better field representation than counting the number of stars in boxes fixed in size .",
    "then , the stars in the cluster cmd that fall within the defined cells and closest to the representative positions are eliminated .",
    "the method allows that cells vary in magnitude and colour separately according to the free path between field stars in the cmd , so that they result bigger in cmd regions with a small number of stars , and vice versa .",
    "the free path is defined as @xmath19(colour)@xmath7 + @xmath19(magnitude)@xmath7 = ( free path)@xmath7 , where @xmath19(colour ) and @xmath19(magnitude ) are the distances from the considered star to the closest one in abscissa and ordinate in the field cmd . in practice , an initial rectangular cell with a dimension of ( @xmath19(colour ) , @xmath19(magnitude ) = ( 0.5 , 1.0 ) is put on a single field star .",
    "then , the method looks for the closest star in magnitude and colour ( it will be placed at a corner of the rectangular cell ) , so that the resulting closest magnitude and colour will be used to define the free path of the considered star .",
    "the task is repeated for every star in the field cmd .",
    "therefore , each field star has associated a different cell .",
    "these cells are then superimposed to the cluster cmd , and the stars closest to their centres are eliminated . in this sense ,",
    "the cell sizes depend not only on the stellar density of that field ( the denser a field the more stars in the field cmd ) , but also on the magnitude and colour distributions of those field stars in the cmd , making some parts of the field cmd more populated than others .",
    "for instance , relatively bright field red giants with small photometric errors usually appear relatively isolated at the top - right zone of the cmd , while faint main sequence ( ms ) stars are more numerous at the bottom part of the cmd . for this reason ,",
    "bigger cells are required to satisfactorily subtract stars from the cluster cmd regions where there is a small number of field stars , while smaller cells are necessary for those cmd regions more populated by field stars .    after repeating the procedure of subtracting stars from the cluster cmd using the four selected surrounding fields",
    ", we obtained four cleaned cluster cmds which were compared to each other . as a general rule",
    ", each star in the observed cluster cmd keeps not subtracted different times ; the more the times a star is subtracted , the higher the probability of being a field feature .",
    "thus , we convert the number of times that a star appears in the four cleaned cluster cmds in an estimation of its probability ( p ) of being a fiducial feature in that cluster cmd . for instance , stars that are considered to belong to the field population appear once , or do not appear in the four cleaned cluster cmds ( we refer to them as of p @xmath4 25% ) ; stars that could indistinguishably belong to the field or to the studied object are seen twice ( p = 50@xmath3 ) ; and stars that are predominatly found in the cleaned cluster area rather than in the star field population ( p @xmath20 75% ) are identified more than twice . whenever the cmds for stars with p @xmath4 25% looks like that of p @xmath20 75% , we conclude that both the star field and the cluster are of similar features ( ages ) .    to illustrate the bulk of the analysis performed , we produced multiple panel figures for the objects listed in table 1 .",
    "as an example , we include fig .",
    "2 , which depicts three cmds and an enlargement of the @xmath10 image centred on sl390 .",
    "we overplotted to the enlarged image a circle representing the cluster radius used in the analysis and marked the stars that have a chance of being cluster members p @xmath20 75@xmath3 .",
    "the three cmds represent the observed cluster cmd for the stars measured within the cluster radius ( upper - left panel ) ; a single field cmd for an annulus centred on the cluster , with an internal radius 3 times that of the cluster and an equal cluster area ( upper - right panel ) ; and the cleaned cluster cmd ( bottom - left ) .",
    "the colour scale represents stars that statistically belong to the field ( p @xmath4 25% , white ) , stars that might belong either to the field or to the cluster ( p @xmath21 50% , gray ) , and stars that predominantly populate the cluster region ( p @xmath20 75% , black ) .",
    "the multiple panel figures for the entire sample of clusters can be found at the on - line version of the journal as supplementary material .",
    "the distribution of stars with different membership probabilities in the cmd as well as in the cluster field were used at a time to confirm the physical reality of the studied cluster candidates .",
    "we required that the stars with p @xmath20 75% within the cluster radius have as a counterpart a cmd resembling that of a star cluster to conclude that we are dealing with a genuine physical system . in some cases",
    ", we reinforced our conclusion about the nature of an object from the analysis of the distribution of stars with p = 50@xmath3 and @xmath4 25@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we found that a handful of objects could be possible non - clusters , since either the cmds and/or the distribution of stars in the respective fields do not resemble that of an stellar aggregate ( bsdl218 , 256 , 616 , 661 , 1103 , 2794 , 2824 , 2841 , 2842 , 2891 , 2898 , brht60a , 62b , gkk - o155 , 203 , 205 , h88 - 248 , 318 , kmhk125 , 237 , 258 , 289 , 609 , 897 , ogle291 , 303 , 335 , 344 , and sl371 ) .",
    "3 depicts the results for bsdl616 , where the cleaned cmd shows a ms and a red clump ( rc ) mostly composed by field stars .",
    "other possible non - clusters resulted to be single bright stars surrounded by unresolved faint ones .",
    "fortunately , the mosaic ii images have a better resolution and a fainter magnitude limit than those used for catalogued cluster candidates ( see details in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so apparent compact extended objects could be resolved . as an example , fig .",
    "4 compares an enlargement of the @xmath10 image centred on kmhk125 to that obtained from the dss .",
    "we estimated ages for the 61 confirmed star clusters by using the set of theoretical isochrones computed by @xcite for the washington photometric system .",
    "the isochrones were first reddened by the appropriate cluster colour excesses and corrected due to the distance effect .",
    "then , we superimposed those for a metallicity level of z = 0.008 to the cluster cmds and chose the ones which best reproduced the cluster features to assign the cluster ages .",
    "the matching procedure was performed using stars with p @xmath20 75@xmath3 .",
    "the estimation of cluster reddening values was made by interpolating the extinction maps of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bh ) .",
    "bh maps were obtained from hi ( 21 cm ) emission data for the southern sky .",
    "they furnish us with foreground @xmath22 colour excesses which depend on the galactic coordinates .",
    "we also took advantages of the magellanic clouds extinction values based on rc stars photometry provided by the ogle collaboration @xcite as described in @xcite .",
    "they resulted in average ( 0.02 @xmath2 0.01 ) mag smaller than those obtained by bh .",
    "as for the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sfd ) full - sky maps from 100-@xmath23 m dust emission , we decided not to use them since the authors found that deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of hi emission towards denser clouds and of formation of h@xmath24 in molecular clouds .",
    "the relatively small angular sizes of the clusters did not allow us to trace reddening variations in any extinction map .",
    "finally , we adopted the values obtained from the bh s maps , which are listed in table 1 .",
    "their accuracy is 0.01 mag in @xmath22 or 10@xmath3 of the reddening , whichever is larger .",
    "notice that a relative @xmath12 colour shift smaller than @xmath0 0.05 mag hardly turns into a meaningful difference when matching isochrones of the same metallicity to the cluster mss .",
    "likewise , the mean @xmath12 colour difference for isochrones of the same age and with the closest metallicity values that the washington photometric system is able to distinguish ( @xmath19([fe / h ] ) = 0.20 dex , @xcite ) results larger than @xmath0 0.20 mag .",
    "consequently , the reddening uncertainties do not affect neither the age nor the metallicity adopted for the clusters .",
    "the lmc is located at a distance of 50 kpc @xcite and according to @xcite it has an average depth of ( 3.44 @xmath2 1.16 ) kpc , which implies a difference in its distance modulus as large as @xmath19(@xmath25 ) @xmath0 0.30 mag . given that the clusters could be placed in from of , or behind the lmc , the simple assumption that all of them are at the same distance would lead to age uncertainties of @xmath26(log(@xmath5 ) ) @xmath4 0.06 .",
    "however , the age difference of the isochrones with the same metallicity bracketing the observed cluster mss resulted to be in average @xmath19(log(@xmath5 ) ) = 0.20 .",
    "therefore , we decided to adopt the value of the lmc distance modulus @xmath27 = 18.493 @xmath2 0.008 reported by @xcite for all the clusters .",
    "indeed , we generally found an excellent match .",
    "as for the cluster metallicity we adopted the same value for all of them .",
    "@xcite showed that during the last 3 gyr ( the age range of our cluster sample ) the lmc cluster population has chemical evolved or spread within the range [ fe / h ] = ( -0.4 @xmath2 0.2 ) dex . on the other hand , according to the washington photometry metallicity sensitivity we should use isochrones for metallicity levels in steps of @xmath19([fe / h ] ) = 0.20 dex . further higher metallicity resolution would lead to negligible changes in the isochrones overplotted on the cluster cmds .",
    "however , we found that only isochrones with the same age and metallicity differences larger than @xmath19([fe / h ] ) @xmath0 0.30 - 0.40 dex can be meaningfully differentiated due to the dispersion of the stars .",
    "for this reasons , we adopted a mean value of [ fe / h ] = -0.40 dex for cluster metallicities , and assumed an error of @xmath26([fe / h ] ) = 0.20 dex .    in the matching procedure , which was performed looking at the cluster cmd",
    ", we used a subset of isochrones and superimposed them on the cluster cmds , once they were properly shifted by the corresponding @xmath28 = 1.97@xmath6@xmath22 colour excesses and by the lmc apparent distance modulus ( @xmath29 = @xmath10 + 0.58@xmath22 - @xmath30 ) @xcite .",
    "finally , we adopted as the cluster age the one corresponding to the isochrone which best reproduced the cluster main features in the cmd .",
    "the presence of rcs and/or red giant branch stars in some cluster cmds made the matching procedure easier .",
    "table 1 lists the resulting age estimates , while the bottom left panel in fig .",
    "2 ( likewise the on - line figures ) show the corresponding isochrones superimposed . the observed dispersion seen in the cluster cmds",
    "can be encompassed with a couple of isochrones bracketing the derived mean age by @xmath19(log(@xmath5 ) ) = @xmath20.10 .",
    "we also included these adjacent isochrones in fig .",
    "2 ( bottom - left panel ) .",
    "thirty - seven clusters in the sample have previous age estimates ( see table 1 ) .",
    "@xcite made use of washington @xmath8 photometry obtained at the ctio blanco telescope and the mosaic ii camera and derived an age of log(@xmath5 ) = 9.04@xmath20.04 for hs156 , in excellent agreement with our present value ( 9.00@xmath20.10 ) .",
    "we also found a tight agreement with @xcite , who derived from ogle data an age of log(@xmath5 ) = 8.2 for hs198 ( 8.15@xmath20.10 ) .",
    "a more careful analysis requires the comparison of our ages with those of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter g10 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p12 ) for 10 and 25 clusters in common , respectively .",
    "g10 used data from the magellanic clouds photometric survey @xcite of clusters mostly distributed in the main body of the galaxy , which is highly crowded .",
    "although they mention that field contamination is a severe effect in the extracted cluster cmds and therefore influences the age estimates , no decontamination from field cmds was carried out .",
    "it would not be unexpected that some of the studied objects are not real star clusters , particularly those with very uncertain age estimates [ @xmath26(log(@xmath5 ) ) @xmath20 0.5 ] .",
    "indeed , g10 estimated an age value for kmhk125 of log(@xmath5 ) = 7.2@xmath20.3 , for which our study suggests it could be a possible non - cluster ( see .",
    "this possibility alerts us to the fact that solely the circular extraction of the observed cmds of clusters located in highly populated star fields is not enough neither for an accurate isochrone fitting to the cluster mss nor for confirming their physical nature .",
    "@xcite found little visible evidence for incompleteness for @xmath31 @xmath14 20 mag , corresponding to a ms turnoff of log(@xmath5 ) @xmath32 8.7 .",
    "the present @xmath33 data set nearly reaches the 100@xmath3 completeness level at @xmath10 @xmath0 22.0 mag , which corresponds to ms turnoffs of log(@xmath5 ) @xmath0 9.6 .",
    "furthermore , the scale of our images is 0.274@xmath1 pix@xmath34 , while that of the magellanic cloud photometric survey is 0.7@xmath1 pix@xmath34 , so that crowding effects at the centre of the objects is more important in their images .    p12 derived ages from integrated photometry for the clusters of @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the integrated light brings information about the composite stellar population distributed along the line - of sight . for",
    "clusters of small angular size projected towards relatively crowded fields , the field contamination and stochastic effects , in addition to less deep photometric data could mislead the data analysis .",
    "indeed , @xcite compared the ages coming from @xcite , g10 , and p12 and then , due to the large uncertainties in ages coming from integrated magnitudes and colours , assigned ages to the clusters giving the highest priority to hst ages from @xcite , followed by g10 , the ogle data , and finally p12 .",
    "the best - fitting relation between g10 and p12 over 293 clusters in common resulted in an slope of 1.35@xmath20.35 and in a pearson coefficient of 0.77 . from this result @xcite concluded that there exists a good agreement between g10 and p12 .",
    "5 shows the comparison between the ages derived by g10 ( left panel ) and p12 ( right panel ) and our present values .",
    "the error bars correspond to the age uncertainties quoted by the authors , while the thick and thin lines represent the identity relationship and those shifted by @xmath21@xmath26(log(@xmath5)@xmath35 ) , respectively .",
    "black filled squares represent clusters that do not fullfill the requirement @xmath26(log(@xmath5)@xmath35 ) + @xmath26(log(@xmath5)@xmath36 ) @xmath20 @xmath37log(@xmath5)@xmath35 - log(@xmath5)@xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "as can be seen , there is a reasonable agreement , although several clusters significantly depart from the @xmath21@xmath26 strip .",
    "we have carefully checked our multi - panel fig . 2 ( on - line material ) in order to seek a possible explanation for such deviations and found out that stochastic effects caused by the presence of isolated bright stars , a significant field contamination , and a less faint magnitude limit could be some of the factors that affected the integrated light , and hence the p12 s age estimates .",
    "particularly , the presence of a young field ms could cause the p12 s age for h88 - 270 and hs228 resulted younger than our values .",
    "conversely , an old field population could cause bsdl194 , h88 - 240 , and sl390 appear older at their integrated light .",
    "examples of the presence of isolated bright stars can be bsdl87 , h88 - 238 , 276 , among others .",
    "we conclude that the present results point the need of a better study of the lmc clusters with , e.g. , 8-m class telescopes .",
    "our results suggest that nearly 2/3 of the studied candidate star clusters would appear to be genuine physical systems .",
    "we also show that the ages derived by g10 and p12 can reflect those of the composite stellar populations of the lmc field . as far as we are aware , this is the first time that evidence is presented showing that some lmc candidate star clusters are not possible genuine physical systems .    in order to examine whether there exists any dependence of the fraction of possible non - clusters with the position in the lmc , we have made use of the central deprojected galactocentric distances of the nine mosaic ii fields computed by assuming that they are part of a disc having an inclination @xmath38 = 35.8@xmath39 and a position angle of the line of nodes of @xmath40 = 145@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to table 1 of @xcite which includes a summary of orientation measurements of the lmc disc plane , as well as their analysis of the orientation and other lmc disc quantities , supporting the present adopted values .",
    "notice that most of the clusters catalogued by b08 located within the mosaic fields have already been studied previously -we have made use of them here- @xcite and in the present work , so that there is no incompleteness effects in the estimated fraction of possible non - clusters in these areas .",
    "6 illustrates the behaviour of the proportion of possible non - clusters as a function of the deprojected distance .",
    "as can be seen , there exists no visible trend but an averaged fraction of 0.13@xmath20.06 within the lmc inner disc ( distance from the lmc centre @xmath4 4@xmath39 , * ? ? ?",
    "this does not seem to be a significant percentage of the catalogued clusters .",
    "if we assume a similar percentage for the whole catalogued lmc clusters distributed throughout the inner disc , we would expect that some @xmath0 ( 300@xmath2140 ) objects were not real stellar aggregates . in the case that the possible non - clusters had their own spatial distribution ,",
    "it would be possible to recover the expected spatial distribution of genuine star clusters by using the former to correct that of the catalogued clusters .",
    "we finally built the cluster frequencies ( cfs ) -the number of clusters per time unit as a function of age @xcite - for the nine studied lmc regions with the aim of investigating their variations in terms of the position in the galaxy recently reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p14 ) .",
    "particularly he found that 30 doradus turns out to be the region with the highest relative frequency of the youngest clusters , while the log(@xmath5 ) = 9 - 9.5 ( 1 - 3 gyr ) age range is characterised by cluster formation at a higher rate in the inner regions ( e.g. bar , outer bar ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than in the outer ones ( e.g. , blue arm , constellation iii , south - east arm ) .    when building the cfs we took into account the unavoidable complication that the cluster ages have associated uncertainties",
    "indeed , by considering such errors , the interpretation of the resulting cfs can differ appreciably from those obtained using only the measured ages without accounting for their errors .",
    "however , the treatment of age errors in the cf is not a straightforward task .",
    "this happens when an age value does not fall in the bin centre and , due to its errors , has the chance to fall outside it .",
    "note that , since we chose bin dimensions as large as the involved errors , such points should not fall on average far beyond the adjacent bins . however , this does not necessarily happen for all the age values , and we should consider at the same time any other possibility .",
    "we followed the procedure outlined by p14 , which achieves a compromise between the age bin size and the age errors .",
    "particularly , we considered the possibility that the extension covered by an age value ( properly a segment of 2@xmath6@xmath26(age ) long ) may have a dimension smaller , similar or larger than the age bin wherein it is placed .",
    "the assigned weight was computed as the fraction of its age segment that falls in the age bin .",
    "7 shows the resultant cfs built from the catalogue of cluster ages compiled by p14 and from the ages estimated in this work , which encompass 90@xmath3 of the whole sample of catalogued clusters located in the studied lmc regions .",

    "however , we do not rule out that some percentage of such a variation comes from the fact that we are dealing with relatively small areas and consequently some age regimes result not well sampled .",
    "nevertheless , fig .",
    "7 suggests that the innermost field contains a handful of clusters older than @xmath0 2 gyr ; the epoch of an important burst of cluster formation that took place after a cluster age gap @xcite .",
    "it also shows that there has been a wider spread between different cfs during the most recent 50 myr of the galaxy lifetime .",
    "the astrophysical properties of lmc star clusters have been the starting point to address galactic global issues such as the age - metallicity relationship and the cluster formation rate , among others . however , the number of clusters with estimated properties is by far less than a half of the catalogued clusters .",
    "therefore , it results of great importance to enlarge the number of objects confirmed as genuine star clusters and to estimate their fundamental parameters .",
    "we have used washington photometry for 90 star cluster candidates of small angular size , typically @xmath0 11@xmath1 in radius , distributed within nine fields ( 36@xmath636 arcmin@xmath7 ) located in the lmc inner disc to estimate their ages and to build their local cluster frequencies .",
    "some clusters are projected towards relatively crowded fields .    in order to assure a meaninful interpretation of the observed cluster cmds",
    ", we applied a subtraction procedure to statistically clean them from the field star contamination .",
    "thus , we could disentangle cluster features from those belonging to their surrounding fields .",
    "the employed technique makes use of variable cells in order to reproduce the field cmd as closely as possible .    out",
    "of the 90 cluster candidates studied , 61 resulted to be genuine physical systems , whereas the remaining ones were classified as possible non - clusters since either their cmds and/or the distribution of stars in the respective fields do not resemble those of stellar aggregates .",
    "we statistically show that @xmath0 ( 13 @xmath2 6)@xmath3 of the catalogued clusters distributed within the inner disc ( distance from the lmc @xmath4 4@xmath39 ) could be possible non - clusters , independently of their deprojected distances .",
    "we derived the ages for the confirmed clusters from the fit of theoretical isochrones computed for the washingotn system to the cleaned cluster cmds . when adjusting a subset of isochrones we took into account the lmc distance modulus and the individual star cluster colour excesses .",
    "the derived ages resulted to be in the age range 7.8 @xmath4 log(@xmath5 ) @xmath4 9.2 .",
    "finally , we built cfs from ages available in the literature and from the ages estimated in this work , which encompass 90@xmath3 of the whole sample of catalogued clusters located in the studied lmc regions .",
    "we found that there exists some spatial variation of the lmc cf throughout the inner disc .",
    "particularly , the innermost field ( deprojected distance @xmath0 0.56@xmath39 ) contains a handful of clusters older than @xmath0 2 gyr , while the wider spread between different cfs has taken place during the most recent 50 myr of the galaxy lifetime .",
