    "to understand the m - theory , it should be important to study the m2-branes and the m5-branes .",
    "recently , it was proposed that the stack of @xmath0 m2-branes on the orbifold @xmath1 @xmath2 can be studied by a three dimensional @xmath3 superconformal chern - simons matter theory @xcite , which is called the abjm theory .",
    "similarly , the m5-branes are believed to be described by some non - trivial six dimensional field theory .",
    "the field theory on the m5-branes itself would also be interesting and play important roles to understand various non - perturbative properties of supersymmetric gauge theories . however , there are no explicit field theoretical descriptions for the multiple m5-branes so far .",
    "on the other hand , the m5-branes can be realized as the solitons in the abjm theory .",
    "indeed we can construct bps solitons which are the analogues of the nahm data for the non - abelian monopoles in @xmath4 dimensional gauge theory @xcite . in these solutions the m5-branes",
    "are realized as the m2-branes blowing up into a fuzzy sphere .",
    "there is also a noncommutative - plane - like construction of the m5-branes @xcite .",
    "these solutions enable us to investigate the m5-branes via the abjm theory .",
    "similar fuzzy sphere structure appears also as non - trivial vacua in the mass deformed abjm theory @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this configuration does not carry net m5-brane charges , but carries the dipole m5-brane charges .",
    "this is an analogue of the myers effect for the d - branes @xcite , which is , of course , related to the nahm construction of the monopoles .",
    "the mass deformed abjm theory should also be a useful tool to study the m5-branes .",
    "relation to the m5-branes is also observed in the gravity side .",
    "the uv limit of the mass deformed abjm theory is same as the abjm theory itself . on the other hand",
    ", the mass deformation breaks the conformal invariance and hence should result in the different ir behavior .",
    "indeed the analyses of the holographic rg flow @xcite suggest that the theory would describe a particular configuration of the m5-branes in the ir limit .",
    "hence it is interesting to study the mass deformed abjm theory for large @xmath0 .    in this paper , as a simple example we shall study the partition function ( free energy ) of the mass deformed abjm theory on @xmath5 in the large @xmath0 limit . with the help of the localization technique @xcite , the partition function can be exactly computed by a @xmath6 dimensional matrix model @xcite . though it is still difficult to perform these integrals for general large number @xmath0 , in the large @xmath0 limit we can evaluate the partition function by the saddle point approximation .",
    "we achieve to solve the saddle point equations for finite values of the chern - simons levels and the mass deformation parameter , i.e. in the m - theoretical regime . with the solutions ( eigenvalue distributions ) , we compute the exact large @xmath0 partition function .",
    "interestingly , we find two different solutions , which cause a first order phase transition in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "since the theory we consider coincide to the abjm theory in the uv limit , the dual geometry will be characterized by the same asymptotics as in the abjm case : it will be asymptotically @xmath7 where the boundary of @xmath8 is @xmath5 .",
    "our result may predict the existence of new solutions of this class and a phase transition in the gravity side .    among various mass deformations of the abjm theory ,",
    "the theory we consider have the largest @xmath9 supersymmetry ; the same amount as the undeformed abjm theory . in this sence",
    "our setup is the `` simplest '' example of the non - conformally deformed field theories .",
    "hopefully , the mass deformed abjm theory we consider would play important roles of the toy model to reveal fundamental structures in the theories with non - trivial rg flow .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we shall briefly review the mass deformation of the abjm theory . in section [ localization ]",
    "we display the matrix model expression of the partition function resulting from the localization , and the saddle point equation for this matrix model .",
    "if we formally take the mass parameter pure imaginary , the partition function coincides with that of the abjm theory with the non - canonical @xmath10-charge assignments which have been studied intensively @xcite in the context of the f - theorem @xcite . to compare with our main results",

    "<S> in this paper , using the localization technique we analyze the large @xmath0 limit of the mass deformed aharony - bergman - jafferis - maldacena ( abjm ) theory on the three sphere with a finite mass parameter and finite chern - simons levels . </S>",
    "<S> we find two different solutions of the saddle point equations in the large @xmath0 limit . with these solutions we compute the free energy and find that there is a first order phase transition . </S>",
