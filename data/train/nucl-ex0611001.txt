    "carries information on the early stage of heavy - ion collisions , and has been extensively studied .",
    "event - by - event flow fluctuations @xcite are of considerable interest as they must be sensitive to the physics of the very early stages of the collision , and because any fluctuation observable has potential relevance for phase transition phenomena .",
    "understanding flow fluctuations would also greatly improve anisotropic flow measurements that are currently dominated by systematic uncertainties in which flow fluctuations play a crucial role . at fixed centrality",
    ", initial - state fluctuations in the spatial anisotropy of the participant zone will cause flow fluctuations .",
    "in addition to this inevitable source of fluctuations , there might be additional fluctuation contributions that could offer unique insights into dynamical details of the collision process at very early times ( 1 @xmath5 and earlier ) @xcite .",
    "the large observed elliptic flow at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) points to a very short thermal equilibration time in the framework of hydrodynamic models .",
    "this puzzling feature calls for further investigation and could have alternative explanations or might be explained by exotic phenomena @xcite . improved methods to experimentally determine flow fluctuations would be an important step towards addressing some or all of the open issues discussed above .",
    "fluctuations in the shape of the initial participant region , and in particular , in the orientation of the region s principal axes relative to the direction of the impact parameter , lead to a non - trivial picture of anisotropic flow . in this picture , the apparent flow at mid - rapidity might be different in direction and magnitude from the real flow as measured with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "the method proposed in this paper is sensitive to such a difference , and allows fluctuations in the orientation of the principal axes of the participant region to be measured .",
    "rhic data hold much promise for the purpose of understanding elliptic flow fluctuations , since @xmath0 is large , while the statistical noise arising from finite multiplicity , that tends to obscure the dynamical fluctuations of interest , is smaller than at lower energies .",
    "most flow analyses at rhic to date have relied on the second - order event plane , whereas in the present study , a case is presented for utilizing the first - order event plane to determine the mean elliptic flow , and to isolate the sought - after dynamical fluctuations about that mean . in rhic experiments ,",
    "first - order event planes can be obtained , for example , via the zdc - smd ( zero degree calorimeter shower maximum detector )  @xcite or the forward tpc  @xcite of the star detector . in the scenario envisaged here ,",
    "the fluctuating anisotropies are based on measurements near mid - rapidity , while the first - order event plane determination utilizes detectors that are far removed in rapidity .",
    "consequently , non - flow effects ( defined as azimuthal correlations that may contribute to @xmath6 measurements , but which are unrelated to the reaction plane orientation , or more generally , are unrelated to the initial geometry of the system ) are believed to be negligible using this method @xcite .",
    "with two independent first - order event planes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , elliptic flow can be determined with the help of the relations & = & ( 2 - - ) + & = & ( 2- 2 ) ( 2- - ) + & = & v_2 ( - ) , [ equ : v2_observables ] where the last factor , @xmath9 is the product of the two first - order event plane resolutions  @xcite .",
    "the above is based on the assumptions that the two event planes are independent , and that the distributions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 with respect to the true reaction plane are symmetric .",
    "we introduce two _ event - by - event _ quantities & = & 2(- ) + & = & 2(- ) , where index @xmath10 denotes the @xmath11 event and the average is taken over all particles in that event . using the equality    ( 2 - - ) & = & + & = & 2 ( - ) ( + ) + 2 ( - ) ( + ) , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( and a similar expression for @xmath14 ) , and averaging over particles in the @xmath11 event , one finds & = & ( + ) + ( + ) [ equ : v2_obs_k ] + & = & ( + ) - ( + ) [ equ : s2_obs_k ] .",
    "we further assume that the distribution of the first - order event planes @xmath15 is independent of distributions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this assumption is usually not valid for second - order event planes , and this illustrates one of the advantages of the present approach . assuming that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are both symmetric around zero and independent , the distributions @xmath15 and @xmath20 are identical .",

    "as mentioned in the previous section , this sum contains the flow fluctuation contribution ( including the fluctuation in the orientation of the principal axes of the participant zone ) as well as the non - flow contribution .",
    "the non - statistical part of this sum ( everything except @xmath32 terms ) corresponds exactly to @xmath55  elliptic flow measured with two - particle correlations at mid - rapidity . to remove non - flow contributions",

    "[ equ : tilt_square_dif_prime ] the non - statistical part of this difference , _ dyn = _ dyn , provides an important relation between fluctuations measured with respect to the first - order reaction plane , @xmath56 , flow fluctuations measured at mid - rapidity ( which includes effects of the fluctuations in the geometry of the participant zone ) , and the distribution in @xmath45 .    in the picture",
    "described above , when the flow fluctuations are driven by fluctuations in the participant eccentricity , it is not obvious that the two first - order event planes defined by spectators from the two nuclei are independent , nor is it obvious that the first - order event plane is independent of the second - order event plane defined by the participants .",
    "indeed , the positions of the spectators are somewhat correlated with the positions of the participants , but as we found using the monte carlo glauber model , this has a negligible effect on correlations of the event planes . in our study",
    ", we used the center of gravity of the spectator distribution with respect to the nuclear center to define the first - order event plane for each nucleus ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) , and the second - order event plane ( @xmath59 ) was defined by the minor axis of the participant zone . using the center of the collision instead of the center of gravity of the spectator distribution",
    "would make the correlation effects even smaller .",
    "we find that for most centralities , the correlations - 1 and + - 1   are at the sub - percent level , with a maximum of about a few percent for the 5% most central collisions .",
    "besides the event plane correlations due to the correlated positions of spectators and participating nucleons , momentum conservation also deserves consideration .",
    "we refer here to an experimental study  @xcite which concluded that there is negligible momentum - conservation correlation between the event plane based on spectators from each nucleus separately and the orientation of directed flow close to mid - rapidity .",
    "it is useful at this stage to consider the notation @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the `` apparent '' flow at mid - rapidity  elliptic event anisotropy measured with respect to the principal axes of the participant zone .",
    "much progress towards a direct measurement of flow fluctuations at mid - rapidity has been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "then the above equations can provide important information on fluctuations in the orientation of the principal axes of the participant zone .",
    "note that the orientation of the participant zone ( and , consequently , the apparent anisotropic flow ) can depend on the rapidity of the particles under study .",
    "then , in principle , one can study the correlations in the orientation of anisotropic flow as function of particle rapidity .",
    "such information will be very valuable for the reconstruction of the initial conditions in heavy - ion collisions .    in summary , various suggestions in the literature point to dynamical event - by - event fluctuations in elliptic flow as being of great interest in the realm of rhic physics , and such fluctuations",
    "are argued to be especially relevant for understanding collision dynamics at the earliest times . on a more technical level in experimental methodology ,",
    "the magnitude of flow fluctuations associated with current elliptic flow measurements is not understood , and this uncertainty affects the overall systematic error on these measurements .",
    "prompted by the above considerations , this work presents a new method for experimental analysis of elliptic flow in a scenario where the first - order event plane can be resolved .",
    "the method allows the extraction of mean @xmath0 and its dynamical event - by - event fluctuations , and good immunity to both statistical fluctuations and non - flow effects can be expected .",
    "simulations have been presented that validate the method under a range of conditions similar to those observed in rhic data .",
    "it has been shown that measurements of flow fluctuations using the first - order event plane , accompanied by measurements of apparent flow fluctuations at mid - rapidity , can also provide important information on the fluctuations of the participant zone .",
