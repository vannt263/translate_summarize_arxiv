    "previous studies of forward @xmath9 photoproduction data have shown that the reaction is dominated at low energies by pion exchange and at higher energies by diffractive processes , _",
    "i.e. _ pomeron exchange ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we have chosen to use the non - resonant terms included in the model of oh , titov and lee ( otl )  @xcite in our partial wave analysis .",
    "the otl pomeron exchange amplitude follows the work of donnachie and landshoff  @xcite with the unknown parameters fixed by fitting to high energy vector meson cross section data .",

    "the vertices in these amplitudes were dressed using form factors of the type @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the cutoff parameter for the interaction and @xmath106 is the mass of the exchanged particle .",

    "the pomeron amplitudes are able to describe the energy dependence of the forward cross section , but fail to adequately describe the spin density matrix elements .",
    "the unknown parameters present in the nucleon exchange amplitudes can be modified to describe the backward - angle data at higher energies if some assumptions , the reliability of which are unknown , are made  @xcite .",
    "our analysis is restricted to the energy range from threshold up to 2.4  gev . for c.m .",
    "energies below 2  gev , the @xmath3 exchange amplitude dominates the @xmath2-channel contributions . in the higher energy range used in our analysis ,",
    "the @xmath3 contribution is still substantially larger than that of the pomeron .",
    "thus , the deficiencies in the pomeron amplitudes ( discussed above ) should not greatly affect our pwa results .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen to use the otl @xmath2-channel terms with the parameter values obtained in that analysis  @xcite . due to the unreliability of the assumptions under which",
    "the nucleon exchange parameters were determined , we have decided not to include these amplitudes in our analysis , _",
    "i.e. _ we do not include any @xmath89-channel terms in our fits .",
    "the effect of this choice on our conclusions was found to be negligible ( see section  [ section : sys ] ) .",
    "the formalism used to construct our resonant amplitudes is described fully in  @xcite .",
    "it involves the use of relativistic tensor operators and is similar to the framework employed by anisovich _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "as discussed above , we do not impose resonant - like shapes on our @xmath90-channel waves .",
    "instead , we divide our data into narrow c.m . energy bins . in each of these bins ,",
    "the mass - dependence of an @xmath90-channel wave with spin @xmath111 and parity @xmath112 , which we will denote @xmath113 , is approximated by a constant complex number : @xmath114 where the sum is over the 10-mev wide c.m .",
    "energy bins , @xmath115 are the strength and phase of the mass dependence in each bin , respectively , and @xmath116  mev is the maximum distance in any bin from the centroid @xmath117 .",
    "the resonant waves then enter into our fits according to @xmath118 where @xmath119 are the angular momentum quantum numbers of the initial ( final ) state , @xmath120 are the unknown coupling constants to these states and @xmath121 is the covariant amplitude obtained using the formalism described in  @xcite .",

    "for example , @xmath123 is started randomly in the range @xmath124 .",
    "estimators for the parameters are then found by maximizing the likelihoods independently in each @xmath10 bin . in this way",
    ", the mass dependence of the waves is extracted unbiasedly .",
    "if resonant - like features are found in the cross sections and phase motion of the @xmath90-channel waves , then this is very strong evidence that resonances do contribute to the scattering amplitude .",
    "if the strength observed in an @xmath90-channel wave is due to a single resonant state , then @xmath113 should be ( at least qualitatively ) described by a constant - width breit - wigner line shape of the form : @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 denote the mass and width of the state , respectively .",
    "if , however , the strength in the wave is caused by multiple resonant states or from a non - resonant process , then the use of a breit - wigner line shape is not valid .",
    "the line shape given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bw ] ) neglects the kinematics and dynamics of the mass dependence of the resonance .",
    "this can be an issue , _",

    "this will be addressed below .",
    "before examining our results , it is important to reiterate the goals of our analysis .",
    "we are attempting to extract strong resonance contributions to @xmath9 photoproduction in a least model - dependent way .",
    "we do not enforce resonance shapes on the mass dependence of our partial waves .",
    "instead , we first extract the strengths and phase motion of our partial waves independently in each @xmath10 bin . this stage will be referred to as a partial wave extraction ( pwe ) .",
    "the second stage involves comparing the results of the pwe to what is expected from resonances in a mass - dependent fit ( mdf ) .",
    "the pwe s are performed using unbinned extended maximum likelihood fits to the data in each @xmath10 bin .",
    "the mdf s are simply @xmath128 fits to the phase differences obtained between partial waves in a given @xmath10 region .",
    "we are not looking to build a complete model of @xmath9 photoproduction , _",
    "i.e. _ we do not claim that the fits discussed below contain all of the amplitudes that contribute to this reaction .",
    "because of this , we do not expect the physical observables extracted from our fits to provide perfect descriptions of our measurements ; however , the descriptions in many kinematic regions are very good .",
    "finally , we are not attempting to extract all resonance contributions to @xmath9 photoproduction , only the most significant .",
    "it is important to have a systematic method for selecting wave sets . as discussed in section  [ section : amps : non - resonant ] , all of the wave sets used in our analysis contain the otl @xmath2-channel terms ( which contain no free parameters ) and no @xmath89-channel terms .",
    "systematic studies show that the effects on extracted resonance parameters due to the choice of the non - resonant model are small ( see section  [ section : sys ] ) .    the mass - independent nature of our procedure , _",
    "i.e. _ the bin - to - bin freedom of the resonance parameters , makes the use of smaller wave sets advantageous . for this reason",

    "the goal of this scan was to identify ( possible ) energy ranges where waves of a given @xmath131 perform significantly better than waves of any other spin - parity .",
    "this information alone does not constitute evidence of resonance production ; however , it can serve as a guide as to which waves are more likely to contribute strongly to @xmath9 photoproduction .",
