    "phytoplankton provide the basis of the food chain in the ocean .",
    "they are constituted for the large part by microscopic algae and their abundance is such that they are responsible for roughly one half of the total photosynthesis going on in the planet @xcite .",
    "although phytoplankton are present in virtually all of the world hydrosphere ( more precisely , the top @xmath0 m layer of the water column , called the euphotic layer , where there is enough light for photosynthesis ) , their distribution in space and time is far from uniform @xcite .",
    "space patchiness is observed at scales that go from that of the individual to several hundreds kilometers @xcite .",
    "the spatial patterns , revealed e.g. by remote sensing , include filaments , fronts and more irregular shapes , suggesting that turbulent transport by sea currents may play an important role @xcite .",
    "variability in time , on the other hand , is characterized by sporadic bloom events in which the plankton density in extended regions can grow by up to three orders of magnitude in few days @xcite .",
    "these are seasonal events that may or may not recur annually , and are superimposed onto the weaker day - night and seasonal cycles .",
    "their importance is utmost for several reasons .",
    "depending on the species ( e.g. diatoms ) , due to their abundance , bloom events can have consequences even at the level of the global biogeochemical cycle @xcite .",
    "bloom events involving other species ( e.g. dinoflagellates ) can have harmful effects on water quality and fishery @xcite .",
    "being able to predict the onset of algal blooms is clearly an issue of great practical importance .",
    "several effects of both biological and physical nature contribute to blooms @xcite . from the point of view of biology ,",
    "phytoplankton control occurs both top - down ( grazing by zooplankton @xcite ) , and bottom - up ( nutrient availability ; the microbial loop @xcite ) . in many situations ,",
    "both mechanisms are expected to contribute simultaneously to the bloom event @xcite .",
    "physical processes , such as variation of turbidity in the water basin @xcite , modifications in the thermocline @xcite , and mixing by turbulence @xcite may equally contribute to the dynamics .",
    "we shall focus in this paper on the particular route to bloom formation provided by failure of the top - down control by zooplankton .",
    "central to this is the so called mismatch issue @xcite .",
    "since the life cycle of phytoplankton is typically one order of magnitude shorter than that of zooplankton , a positive fluctuation in phytoplankton productivity is not compensated by a simultaneous increase in the zooplankton population .",
    "this produces the bloom event : the phytoplankton population escapes zooplankton control and grows to the carrying capacity of the medium , before also the zooplankton population grows appreciably , and is able to bring that of the phytoplankton back to its pre - bloom level .    at a sufficiently coarse grained scale ,",
    "the phytoplankton - zooplankton dynamics can be described by concentration fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this constitutes a mean field approximation for a stochastic individual dynamics ; at different levels of complexity , such a description may include the nutrient and even the detritus concentration fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( npz @xcite and npzd @xcite models ) .",
    "the tininess of both phyto- and zooplankton individuals , as well as the size of typical areas of interest for the study of the concentration dynamics ( at least several meters ) , suggests that a mean field description is indeed the most appropriate . the possibility that bloom events be the outcome of fluctuations in the system , however ,",
    "should not be discarded .",
    "this was the situation observed e.g. in @xcite , in which noise in the external parameters of a compartmental pz model , was able indeed to produce shifts between bloom and no - bloom cycles .",
    "the noise induced shift between limit cycles in a dynamical system is a well - known effect ( see e.g @xcite for an application to epidemic spreading ) . in most cases",
    "the noise considered is external , but recently there has been a surge of interest in the role of internally generated demographic noise ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the point that we want to examine in the present paper is precisely whether microscopic fluctuations , disregarded in a mean field approach , can resurface at macroscopic scale , generating an internal noise component , sufficient to trigger the bloom event .",
    "this is an example of demographic fluctuation induced break - up in the mean field description of reaction - diffusion systems , a type of phenomenon that have received a great deal of attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "( notice that , contrary to e.g. @xcite , the noise contribution examined here acts locally in space ) .",
    "the simple pz model by truscott and brindley ( tb model ) , that is going to be considered here , has the nice characteristic that the plankton behaves like an excitable medium @xcite .",
    "this leads one to expect that noise will be particularly effective in destabilizing its dynamics .",
    "( in fact , @xcite considered precisely this model , to generate noise - induced shifts between seasonal bloom and no - bloom cycles ) . in its original version ,",
    "the tb model is zero - dimensional , but it can be easily generalized to include spatial effects such as advection and diffusion @xcite . in the present analysis , a spatially homogeneous domain will be considered , with no advection , but with diffusive terms accounting for small scale motions in the water column .",
    "the game to play will be to determine the demographic fluctuations implicitly neglected in the tb model , and examine under what conditions they can destabilize the system at the level of spatial averages .",

    "it is possible to see that the situation is confirmed in the case of a system with just two homogeneous compartmens coupled diffusively , one evolving on a bloom cycle , the other on a no - bloom cycle : the no - bloom cycle will always be destabilized and the system will lock on a global bloom cycle .",
    "this suggests the following picture :    * demographic noise continuously generates local fluctuations in @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( especially in @xmath45 ) that may push some regions of space in a bloom regime . *",
    "if the noise level is sufficiently high , some of these regions will be large enough for not being destroyed at once by diffusivity ( see passage from year 1 to year 2 in fig .",
    "[ trusfig8 ] ) .",
    "* at this point diffusion , through phytoplankton transfer , quickly destabilizes the surrounding no - bloom regions .",
    "noise is not expected to be important any more in this phase .",
    "the tb model , both in its zero - dimensional version , and in the extended one describing the evolution of @xmath44 and @xmath45 fields , can be seen as a mean field description of some individual level model ( ilm ) . the most natural way to obtain an individual dynamics from a global one ,",
    "is to assume that the birth and death rates at the individual level have the same form as the corresponding quantities at the population level . within these assumptions ,",
    "independence of the birth and death events , together with absence of memory effects at the scales of interest , fix the form of the ilm . a master equation describing its dynamics can thus be obtained , utilizing techniques analogous to those in @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that this is only one of the ways in which an ilm could be obtained from a population level model .",
    "any choice , differing from the present one by identical contributions in the individual birth and death rates , would work as well , as the equations at the population level would remain unchanged .",
    "the issue is particularly important for the zooplankton , that is the source of fluctuations for the model .",
    "nevertheless , the zooplankton death rate @xmath116 appearing the population level equation ( [ tb ] ) already reflect modelling assumptions at the individual level , so that the present choice of ilm is somewhat imposed .    keeping in mind all these caveats ,",
    "analysis of the results from the ilm shows that , for shallow water conditions ( few meters depth ) , and mixing in the water column produced by diffusion ( diffusivity in the range @xmath117 ) , demographic noise is sufficient to cause switching between regimes .",
    "the effect is of the same order of magnitude as that of the global temperature fluctuations considered in @xcite ( fluctuation amplitude @xmath118 with correlation time equal to 35 days ) . from the point of view of the pz model",
    ", this corresponds to a decrease of the instability threshold in the seasonal temperature forcing , with respect to the mean - field case , of the order of @xmath119 ( see fig .",
    "[ trusfig4 ] ) .",
    "an interesting aspect of the present analysis , common to what was obtained in @xcite in the case of turing waves , is how local fluctuations are able to produce a global destabilization in the system , that is expected to be maintained in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite basin .",
    "the reason is partly trivial : the reproduction rates at the population level are nonlinear functions of the concentration fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and fluctuations lead necessarily to their renormalization .",
    "such a picture , however , is incomplete , as the destabilization process , in the present case , unless the demographic noise is very large , destabilizes the system only locally .",
    "( the characteristic scale of the fluctuations coincides with that of the turing patterns of the system , and has nothing to do with stochastic demography ) . only later , by an invasive process , which appears to be insensitive to system size , the destabilized regions rapidly inglobate the inactive surroundings , leading to the global bloom cycle .    it is interesting to notice that , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ trusfig5 ] , the invasive dynamics is associated with a spatially intermittency of the @xmath44 field in the pre - bloom phase , with the high @xmath44 regions acting as seeds for the coming bloom phase . this condition could be utilized in experiments to contrast the particular destabilization mechanism described here , with the one provided , say , by global temperature fluctuations .",
    "again as regards the spatial structure of the blooms , it is worth comparing the role of the characteristic length @xmath72 defined in eq .",
    "( [ lambda_c ] ) , with the vertical inhomogeneity scales considered in @xcite . in both cases , the bloom event is produced by a local phytoplankton growth that is not balanced by dispersion . in one case , horizontally , in the other , in the vertical direction .",
    "the present model bypassed all difficulties associated with the vertical plankton distribution and vertical structure of the water basin , considering implicitly a shallow water condition .",
    "an interesting question is therefore , whether phenomena such as the `` critical turbulence '' in @xcite may act as a localization mechanisms , that lets the destabilization route described in this paper act also in deep water .    a different question concerns the robustness of the present results under extension of the model to inclusion of bottom - up effects by nutrients from one side , or inclusion of finer grained details in the pz dynamics .",
    "while one would expect irrelevance of the @xmath45 fluctuations in a nutrient unbalance dominated bloom scenario , such as the one depicted in @xcite , the question remains open as regards the situation in which zooplankton control is dominant .",
    "the feedback by an increase of the zooplankton deaths , on the nutrient field , and then on the phytoplankton growth rate [ the parameter @xmath120 in eq .",
    "( [ tb ] ) ] , would suggest a positive effect .",
    "closer scrutiny is clearly required .",
