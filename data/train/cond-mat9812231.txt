    "liquids cooled toward their glass transition exhibit remarkable dynamical behavior @xcite .",
    "the initial slowing down of many liquids at temperatures well above their glass transition temperature @xmath0 can be described to great extent by the mode coupling theory @xcite , which predicts diverging relaxation times at a dynamical critical temperature @xmath1 despite the absence of a diverging or even growing static correlation length @xcite . at the same time , experiments in the temperature range @xmath2 , and simulations in the range @xmath3 , have shown that it is possible to select subsets of particles in the liquid ( or monomers in the case of polymers ) that move differently from the bulk on time scales less than the structural relaxation time @xcite .",
    "the question then arises as to whether glass - forming liquids exhibit _ spatially heterogeneous _ dynamics , and if so , is there a growing length scale associated with this dynamical heterogeneity ?    we have employed three complementary computational approaches to address this question :    1 .",
    "_ subset approach .",
    "_ in this approach @xcite , we monitor the displacement of each particle in a time window @xmath4 , rank the displacements from largest to smallest , and examine spatial correlations within subsets of particles exhibiting either extremely large or extremely small displacements . in this way",
    ", we have demonstrated that particles of similar mobility form clusters that grow with decreasing temperature @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , particles exhibiting the largest displacements within a time window in the late-@xmath6/early-@xmath7 relaxation regime ( `` mobile '' particles ) form low - dimensional clusters that grow and percolate at the mode coupling transition temperature @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   _ displacement - displacement correlation function approach .",
    "_ in this approach @xcite , we monitor the displacement of each particle in a time window @xmath4 as above , and calculate a bulk , equilibrium correlation function that measures the correlations between the local fluctuations in the particle displacements . because this approach does not rely on defining subsets via arbitrary thresholds or cutoffs , it may prove more amenable to future analytical treatment .",
    "first passage time approach .",
    "_ in this approach @xcite , we monitor the first passage time @xmath8 for each particle to move a distance @xmath9 , and then for a given @xmath9 , examine spatial correlations between the different @xmath8 values either by grouping particles into subsets of similar @xmath8 , or by calculating a @xmath8-@xmath8 correlation function using all the particles .",
    "this approach shows that particles with similar first passage times to travel any @xmath9 are spatially correlated .",
    "it also allows us to identify particular values of @xmath9 for which the first passage times are most correlated , and thereby extract detailed information on , e.g. , the cage size .    in this paper",
    ", we present results from the first two approaches outlined above , and show that as an equilibrium lennard - jones liquid approaches @xmath1 , correlations between local fluctuations in particle displacements develop , grow , become increasingly long - ranged , and appear to diverge at @xmath1 .",
    "similar results for a simulated polymer blend are presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "consider a liquid confined to a volume @xmath10 , consisting of @xmath11 identical particles , each with no internal degrees of freedom .",
    "let the position of each particle @xmath12 be denoted @xmath13 .",
    "the motion of a particle @xmath12 may be described by its displacement @xmath14 over some interval of time @xmath4 , starting from a reference time @xmath15 .",
    "the question of whether particle motions in a liquid are correlated can be addressed by modifying the usual definition of the density - density correlation function @xmath16 ( which measures spatial correlations of fluctuations in local density away from the average value @xcite ) so that the contribution of each particle @xmath12 to @xmath16 is weighted by @xmath17 .",
    "thus , we define a `` displacement - displacement '' correlation function @xcite , @xmath18 \\ , \\bigl [ u({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$\\unboldmath}}'},t,\\delta t )    - \\langle u \\rangle \\bigr ] \\bigl\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and where @xmath20 denotes an ensemble average .",
    "@xmath21 measures the correlations of fluctuations of local displacements away from their average value .",
    "since we are considering an equilibrium liquid , and because @xmath22 is defined as an ensemble average , @xmath22 does not depend on the choice of the reference time @xmath15 .",
    "for the same reasons , @xmath23 only depends on @xmath4 for a homogeneous , equilibrium liquid .",
    "@xmath21 can be separated into self and distinct parts , so that we can identify a spatial correlation function @xmath24 analogous to the static pair correlation function @xmath25 conventionally used to characterize the structure of a liquid @xcite : @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 here we have defined the `` total displacement '' @xmath28 as @xmath29 , and its ensemble average @xmath30 .",
    "we have also defined @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . in a constant-@xmath11 ensemble , @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "are readily evaluated as @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath37 is different from the distinct part of the time - dependent van hove correlation function @xmath38 , because it correlates information between pairs of particles using information about the position of each particle at _ two _ different times .",
    "thus @xmath37 is in some sense a four - point correlation function , whereas @xmath38 is a two - point correlation function .",
    "a `` structure factor '' for the particle displacements can be defined as @xmath39 \\biggr \\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the fluctuations of @xmath28 are related to the volume integral of @xmath21 : @xmath40 ^ 2 \\bigr \\rangle = \\int d{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$\\unboldmath } } } \\ , g_u({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$\\unboldmath}}},\\delta t ) \\equiv \\bigl \\langle u \\bigr \\rangle \\bigl \\langle u \\bigr \\rangle kt \\kappa_u , \\label{flucuu}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "recall that the volume integral of the density - density correlation function @xmath16 is proportional to the isothermal compressibility @xmath42 , which diverges at a conventional critical point because @xmath16 becomes long - ranged .",
    "likewise , the fluctuations in @xmath28 will provide information regarding the range of @xmath21 .",
    "thus , in analogy with conventional critical phenomena , we have defined an isothermal `` susceptibility '' @xmath43 .    for a fixed choice of @xmath4 ,",
    "note that if the displacement were always the same for every particle , then @xmath24 and @xmath25 would be identical for all @xmath44 ( and @xmath45 and @xmath46 would be identical for all @xmath47 ) .",
    "hence , it is deviations of @xmath24 ( @xmath45 ) from @xmath25 ( @xmath46 ) that will inform us of correlations of fluctuations of local displacements away from the average value , that are in excess of those that would be expected based on a knowledge of @xmath25 or @xmath46 alone .",
    "we have measured the spatial correlations in particle displacements using data obtained @xcite from a molecular dynamics simulation of a model lennard - jones glass - former .",
    "the system is a three - dimensional binary mixture ( 80:20 ) of 8000 particles interacting via lennard - jones interaction parameters @xcite .",
    "we analyze data from seven @xmath48 state points that lie on a line in the @xmath49 plane , approaching the mode - coupling dynamical critical temperature @xmath50 at a pressure @xmath51 and density @xmath52 @xcite ( all values are quoted in reduced units @xcite ) . the highest and lowest temperature state points simulated are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . following equilibration at each state point , the particle displacements are monitored in the nve ensemble for up to @xmath55 lennard - jones time units ( 25.4 ns in argon units ) for the coldest @xmath5 .",
    "complete simulation details may be found in @xcite .    for all seven state points ,",
    "a `` plateau '' exists in both the mean square displacement and the intermediate scattering function @xmath56 as a function of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the plateau separates an early time ballistic regime from a late time diffusive regime , and indicates `` caging '' of the particles typical of low @xmath5 , high density liquids .",
    "the same model liquid , simulated along a different path toward the same mode coupling critical point , was found to be well described by the ideal mode coupling theory @xcite .",
    "for the present ( larger ) simulation , the @xmath7-relaxation time @xmath57 that describes the long - time decay of @xmath56 at the value of @xmath58 corresponding to the first peak in the static structure factor @xmath46 increases by 2.4 orders of magnitude , and follows a power law @xmath59 , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath62 is found to behave as @xmath63 .",
    "the simulated liquid states analyzed here therefore exhibit the complex bulk relaxation behavior characteristic of a supercooled liquid approaching its glass transition .",
    "throughout the following subsection , all quantities are calculated using all 8000 particles in the system .",
    "results do not change substantially if the minority particles are not included in the analysis . in the cluster analysis in subsection _ [ seccluster ]",
    "_ , only the majority particles are included in the analysis .",
    "however , our results do not change quantitatively when the minority particles are included .",
    "recall that in the mode coupling analysis of this model liquid by kob and andersen , the same mode coupling transition temperature was found for the majority particles as for the minority particles @xcite .",
    "@xmath64 is shown for different @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ figsuu ] , calculated for a value of @xmath4 chosen on the order of @xmath57 for each @xmath5 . for intermediate and large @xmath58 , @xmath65 coincides with the static structure factor @xmath66\\bigr \\rangle$ ] ( see inset ) .",
    "however , for @xmath67 a peak in @xmath65 develops and grows with decreasing @xmath5 , suggesting the presence of increasing long range correlations in @xmath21 .",
    "no such growing peak at @xmath68 appears in the static structure factor @xmath69 ( cf .",
    "inset ) , indicating the absence of long range correlations in the particle positions .",
    "to    indeed , a comparison of @xmath37 and @xmath70 shows that at every @xmath5 simulated , the particle displacements are more correlated than their positions . at the lowest @xmath5",
    ", this excess correlation persists for values of @xmath71 up to 6 interparticle distances @xcite .    in fig.[figsuu",
    "] @xmath4 is chosen on the timescale of the @xmath7-relaxation time .",
    "the significance of the time interval @xmath4 can be seen by examining the `` susceptibility '' @xmath72 .",
    "here we have calculated @xmath73 directly from the fluctuations in the total displacement @xmath28 .",
    "[ figchidt ] demonstrates four important points : ( i ) as @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath76 , @xmath77 is equal to the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity .",
    "thus correlations can not be observed by looking at a `` snapshot '' of the system , that is , by measuring correlations in the instantaneous velocity @xcite .",
    "( ii ) initially , as @xmath4 increases , @xmath43 increases .",
    "thus the spatial correlation of particle displacements develops over time .",
    "( iii ) there is a time window @xmath78 during which @xmath43 is maximum .",
    "both the maximum value of @xmath43 and corresponding time window @xmath78 increase with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "( iv ) as @xmath79 , @xmath43 decreases .",
    "thus in the diffusive regime , where the particles act like brownian particles , there are no correlations in the particle motions .    to    fig .",
    "[ figdt ] shows that the time @xmath78 at which the fluctuations in the particle displacements are a maximum follows a power law with t : an excellent fit to the form @xmath80 is obtained when @xmath81 , and yields @xmath82 , where the highest value of @xmath83 is obtained with the lower bound on @xmath1 .",
    "our estimated value for @xmath83 differs from that describing the divergence at @xmath1 of the structural relaxation time @xmath57 ( @xmath84 ) , but ( within our numerical uncertainty ) can not be distinguished from the exponent governing the apparent vanishing of the diffusion coefficient @xmath62 ( @xmath85 ) .    to    in fig  [ figchit ]",
    "we show the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath86 .",
    "we find that @xmath87 grows monotonically with decreasing @xmath5 , indicating that the range of the correlation measured by @xmath88 is growing with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "the data can be fitted extremely well with a power law @xmath89 with @xmath90 , and yields @xmath91 .",
    "( as shown in the figure , a larger ( closer to curie - weiss - type ) exponent can be obtained by fitting the data with a power law that diverges at a slightly lower value of @xmath1 . )",
    "thus the previously determined mode coupling critical temperature coincides , within our numerical error , with the temperature where @xmath92 becomes long ranged .    to    the displacement - displacement correlation function measures the tendency for particles of similar mobility to be spatially correlated ( cf .",
    "[ figextreme ] ) .    to    to extract a correlation length from the data , we have attempted to fit @xmath93 using an orstein - zernike form , @xmath94 .",
    "this form assumes that @xmath95 is asymptotically proportional to @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the correlation length @xcite .",
    "we find that this form fits well at the highest @xmath5 but fails to fit the data on approaching @xmath1 .",
    "the data can instead be fitted at all @xmath5 using the more general form @xmath98 .",
    "the best fit gives @xmath99 and 3.54 for our highest and lowest @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "however , because @xmath100 depends on @xmath5 , @xmath97 does not show a definite trend with temperature , giving values of roughly three particle diameters .",
    "larger simulations may be required to accurately determine the correct functional form for @xmath101 at small @xmath58 .",
    "nevertheless , the data show unambiguously that as @xmath102 , spatial correlations between the displacements of particles arise and grow and become long - ranged at @xmath1 . to obtain further evidence for a growing dynamical length scale ,",
    "we turn now to the subset method described in the introduction @xcite .",
    "examination of the distribution of particle displacements ( the self part of the usual time - dependent van hove correlation function @xcite ) immediately shows the problems inherent in defining subsets of particles of extremely low mobility . over the time range coincident with the plateau in the mean square displacement ,",
    "this function exhibits a narrow peak containing most of the particles , and a long tail to large distances containing a small percentage of the particles .",
    "the non - gaussian parameter @xmath103 has been used to identify a time when this tail is most pronounced @xcite . at that time , approximately 95% of the particles are contained in the peak , and about 5% are contained in the tail , regardless of temperature . because of this tail , the most mobile particles in the liquid `` distinguish '' themselves from the bulk , while it is more difficult to define a threshold with which to identify particles exhibiting extremely small displacements ( `` immobile '' particles ) .    by examining the _ maximum _ displacement achieved by a particle in a time window @xmath4 , a somewhat better definition of immobility can be achieved .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that particles exhibiting the smallest displacement defined in this way are spatially correlated , and form relatively compact clusters . using this definition of maximum displacement , which for the most mobile particles gives the same results as the simple definition of displacement used above , we find that highly mobile particles also cluster .",
    "these clusters are very ramified , and are composed of smaller `` strings '' of particles that follow one another ( cf .",
    "[ figdino ] ) .    to    in this subsection , we are interested in the growth of clusters of highly mobile particles with decreasing temperature . to this end",
    ", we have constructed clusters of nearest neighbor particles whose maximum displacement in a time window @xmath104 falls within the top 3% , 5% and 7% of all displacements @xcite .",
    "the distribution of clusters of size @xmath105 constructed using the top 5% of the particles is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figperc ] for four different @xmath5 . also shown in fig .",
    "[ figperc ] is the @xmath5-dependence of the mean cluster size @xmath106 for each subset @xcite .",
    "we find that for each subset @xmath107 with @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , all close to @xmath1 .",
    "( note that as the number of particles contained in the subset increases , @xmath110 _",
    "decreases_. ) for the subset containing 5% , the data fall on a straight line when plotted log - log against @xmath111 .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath1 appears to coincide with a percolation transition of the most mobile particles in the liquid .    to    the presence of clusters of mobile particles whose size grows with decreasing temperature contributes to the growing range of the displacement - displacement correlation function",
    ". thus we can use the mean cluster size to give a rough estimate of the length scale on which particle motions are correlated . in our coldest simulation ,",
    "the mean cluster size is approximately @xmath112 particles .",
    "since the clusters have a fractal dimension of approximately 1.75 @xcite , that implies a mean radius of gyration larger than 3 particle diameters .",
    "the largest cluster observed at @xmath113 contains over 100 particles , and thus has a radius of gyration that exceeds the size of our simulation box at that @xmath5 .",
    "it is important to note that while the mean size of clusters of mobile particles appears to diverge at @xmath1 , the smaller , cooperatively rearranging `` strings '' that make up these clusters also grow with decreasing @xmath5 , _ but are still finite at @xmath1 _ @xcite .",
    "in the temperature regime studied here , the distribution of string lengths is exponential , and the mean string length appears to diverge at a temperature substantially lower than @xmath1 .",
    "thus while the mode coupling transition may coincide with a percolation transition of clusters of highly mobile particles , our data is compatible with the idea of adam and gibbs that the ideal glass transition at @xmath114 is associated with the growth and possible divergence of the minimum size of a cooperatively rearranging region ( `` strings '' in the present simulation ) .",
    "this idea will be further explored elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have defined a bulk correlation function that quantifies the spatial correlation of single - particle displacements in a liquid , and we have examined spatial correlations within subsets of highly mobile particles . while the first approach has the advantage of allowing a direct calculation of spatial correlations in local particle motions without having to define arbitrary subsets , the second approach has the advantage of permitting a geometrical analysis of clusters of highly mobile and highly immobile particles . using both approaches ,",
    "we have shown in computer simulations of an equilibrium lennard - jones liquid that the displacements of particles are spatially correlated @xcite over a range and time scale that both grow with decreasing @xmath5 as the mode coupling transition is approached .",
    "while mode coupling theory currently makes no predictions concerning a growing dynamical correlation length , calculation of the vector analog of the displacement - displacement correlation function should be tractable within the mode - coupling framework .",
    "finally , the displacement - displacement correlation function has allowed us to identify a fluctuating dynamical variable u whose fluctuations become longer ranged and appear to diverge at @xmath1 . in this",
    "regard , @xmath28 is behaving much like a static order parameter on approaching a second - order static critical point , suggesting the possibility that we can obtain insights into the nature of glass - forming liquids using an extension to dynamically - defined quantities of the framework of ordinary critical phenomena .",
