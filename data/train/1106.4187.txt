    "measurements of direction dependent specific heat and direction dependent thermal conductivity has enabled us to investigate concrete nodal structures of anisotropic superconductors . for anisotropic superconductors ,",
    "the gap function is considered to belong to an irreducible representation of the point group of crystals , which determines the nodal structure of the gap function@xcite .",
    "the nodal structure of the gap function has strong influence on low temperature behaviors of physical quantities , for example , specific heat and nmr relaxation rate , which are called the power - laws .",
    "thus , from qualitative point of view , it is more important to investigate nodal structures than to culculate concrete values .",
    "furthurmore , since what an irreducible representation the gap function belongs to has close connection with pairing interaction , its identification is crucial for understanding the pairing mechanism .    for conventional s - wave superconductors ,",
    "low temperature behaviors are insensitive to small concentrations of nonmagnetic impurities ( anderson s theorem@xcite ) .",
    "however , it is not the case with anisotropic superconductors . particularly , for gaps with line nodes , density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy",
    "is shifted to nonzero value , and therefore low temperature behaviors are modified by arbitrarily small impurity concentrations@xcite .",
    "thus , impurity effects play an important roll to identify the representation of the gap function .    in this paper , we deal with nonmagnetic impurity effects for anisotropic superconductors .",
    "we assume that the gap function as an order parameter is obtained by the generalized ginzburg - landau theory ( gl ) .",
    "previously , the correction of self - energy part in the dyson equation ( gorkov equation ) due to impurities has been treated by the born or t - matrix approximation .",
    "instead , we take into acount all terms of perturbation series of self - energy part , not as an approximation .",
    "we prove that the introduction of nonmagnetic impurities does not change the representation of the gap function in section iv .",
    "we also show how to obtain nodes of the gap function and show the list for @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 in appendixes .",
    "we consider a mean field approximated hamiltonian which includes nonmagnetic impurity term , @xmath3 where @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is a wave number of electrons , @xmath6 is pseudospin of electrons , @xmath7 is the band energy , @xmath8 is an effective electron - electron interaction , @xmath9 is volume of the system , and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are annihilation ( creation ) operators .",
    "@xmath12 is the gap function .",
    "the last term is nonmagnetic impurity term@xcite .",
    "by @xmath13 we mean not only expectation value at temperature @xmath14 , but also disorder - averaging .",
    "then , equations which temperature green s functions satisfy ( gorkov equation ) are    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are normal and anomalous temperature green s functions of matrix form respectively ( subscript `` 0 '' means that for free fermion system ) , @xmath18 is the matsubara frequency , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the proper self - energy parts .",
    "note that @xmath21 is not merely complex conjugate of @xmath22 , but hermitian conjugate of @xmath22 which differs from that in the appendix of ref",
    ". 8 . throughout this paper",
    ", we take an appropriate regularization if needed .",
    "if temperature @xmath14 is very close to a transition point @xmath23 , the gap equation becomes a linear equation .",
    "therefore while @xmath14 is close enough to @xmath23 , the gap function is a combination of basis functions of an irreducible representation @xmath24 of the group @xmath25 ( the largest group which does not change lattice ) , such as @xmath26 @xmath27 is i - th basis of irreducible representation @xmath24 .",
    "these coefficients @xmath28 are determined by gl .",
    "note that basis functions are the ones for following transformation which forms faithful representation of @xmath25 : @xmath29 @xmath30 is a transformation of @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath31 is the pauli s spin matrix .",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 are the rotation angle and the unit vector which represent the direction of the rotational part ( in the sense of right handed screw ) of the transformation @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is an ( ij ) component of a matrix of irreducible representation @xmath24 of @xmath25 for @xmath30 .",
    "transformations for pseudospins are derived from the fact that due to spin - orbit coupling , interaction @xmath8 is not invariant under rotations of wavenumbers unless we rotate pseudospins simultaneously .",
    "we can write the gap function with @xmath36 or @xmath37 corresponding to singlet ( even parity ) or triplet ( odd parity ) , such as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , respectively , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the pauli s spin matrices . by comparison with eq.([eq : deltai ] ) , we find that , instead of @xmath42 , we can treat @xmath36 or @xmath37 which satisfy : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a rotation matrix which does not have the parity transformation part of @xmath30 . throughout this paper , we take the basis functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be real because accidental degeneracy may not occur .",
    "now , the quasiparticle energy depends on @xmath47 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath47 has zero points derived from its belonging irreducible representation ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the zero points make nodes of the excitation energy on the fermi surface .",
    "since we can find that the quantity in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities corresponding to the gap function of clean superconductors is the proper self - energy part of anomalous type @xmath20 , let us consider @xmath20 . for convenience ,",
    "we first consider a term @xmath50 of perturbation series of @xmath20 ( see fig.[gfgstar ] ) .",
    "note that the subscript `` 1 '' means the exact green s functions in the absence of impurities .",
    "the transformation of @xmath20 such as @xmath51 leads to corresponding transformation of @xmath50 term included in @xmath20 such as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the impurity concentration .",
    "this implies that transformation such as @xmath54 is equivalent to the transformation of green s functions in @xmath20 such as    @xmath55    although the current example does not have @xmath56 , we can always treat general terms like this .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "combinations of adjoining two green s functions appearing in @xmath20 are restricted as left raw below because of particle number conservation at each point .",
    "and we can insert spin rotation matrices into two green s functions as right raw below .",
    "moreover , it is always possible to transform internal wave numbers as well as @xmath50 because internal wave numbers are merely integral variables .",
    "@xmath57 + @xmath58 + @xmath59 + @xmath60 + @xmath61 + @xmath62 + @xmath63 + @xmath64 +    therefore examination on what irreducible representations these green s functions have for above transformations ( [ eq : trans1])-([eq : trans2 ] ) will make it clear that what irreducible representations @xmath20 has for above transformations for @xmath20 .",

    "we can find that @xmath65 is not only maximal but also the largest . because if @xmath68 where the excitation energy is invariant is not contained by @xmath65 , the quasiparticle energy is also invariant under the subgroup which is generated from @xmath69 , this contradicts the fact that @xmath65 is maximal .",

    "calculations in appendix c and d were done by using mathematica .",
    "although theoretical culculations for anisotropic s - wave gaps show that the gap anisotropy is smeared out by introducing nonmagnetic impurities@xcite , and anisotropic s - wave superconductivity is therefore anticipated to explain experimental evidences of yni@xmath99b@xmath99c@xcite , it is no wonder that the nodes disappear because the nodes are not the ones as an irreducible representation .",
    "we should pay attention to that even if nodes of gaps disappear due to impurities , we do not say anything about the amplitudes of gaps . hence , the fact obtained in this paper does not contradict the fact that the axial - like gap ( gap with point node(s ) ) and the polar - like gap ( gap with line node(s ) ) are suppressed partially by introducing nonmagnetic impurities in the case of the born approximation@xcite , and in the case of the t - matrix approximation@xcite . especially , a theoretical culculation by haas @xmath100 @xmath101.@xcite and an experiment by hashimoto @xmath100 @xmath101.@xcite agrees with our theory , although these are too simple to be evidences .",

    "from gorkov equation , we can derive that    @xmath102    putting @xmath103 to @xmath104 , we can obtain zero energy excitation . consider a point where @xmath105 . at that point ,",

    "zero energy excitation exists .",
    "the fact that @xmath98 has the same parity as the gap function is almost trivial .",
