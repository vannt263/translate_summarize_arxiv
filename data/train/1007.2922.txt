    "in recent years we are witnessing an increasing activity in non - equilibrium physics of interacting many - body problems . the reason may be at least two fold .",
    "namely , on one hand this type of problems has nowadays become amenable to a detailed real lab experiments , e.g. in the context of cold atoms and optical lattices @xcite , and on the other hand , they are arguably connected to important open challenges in solid state physics , such as solid - state quantum computation or high temperature super - conductivity . essentially , there are two basic approaches to mathematical treatment of non - equilibrium many - body - physics .",
    "perhaps more common approach @xcite is to consider a large ( ideally infinite ) system in an equilibrium state , then at some instant of time perform a quench of the hamiltonian or join ( couple ) several infinite pieces of the system in distinct equilibria , and observe what happens in the course of time .",
    "for example , there might exist stationary long time behaviour .",
    "the other , more explicit approach @xcite , which we consider here , is to couple a finite ( though perhaps large enough ) system to several external reservoirs which we may describe _ effectively _ in terms of a master equation ( by tracing out their explicit degrees of freedom ) , and consider a _",
    "non - equilibrium steady state _ ( ness ) to which a central system converges after a long time .",
    "there is a variety of techniques involving several levels of assumptions and approximations in deriving the effective system s dynamics after tracing out the reservoirs degrees of freedom @xcite , which at the end result in a simple local - in - time ( markovian ) linear differential equation for the system s density matrix , the so - called quantum liouville equation .",
    "the more general markovian form of such equations is sometimes referred to as the redfield equation , whereas the more mathematically appealing form which manifestly conserves the positivity of the density matrix ( and can be derived from the redfield model with an additional , the so called _ secular _ or _ rotating wave _ approximaiton , is the famous lindblad equation @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that lindblad driven quantum chains provide a fruitful ground for studying non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite .    despite the fact that many simple cases of the redfield and lindblad master equations have been studied",
    ", a very few exactly solvable instances where the central system consists of many interacting particles have been discovered so far .",
    "in particular , in the context of addressing the quantum transport problem @xcite , one is interested in the quantum chain which is coupled to effective ( thermal , chemical , or magnetic ) reservoirs only at the ends of the chain ( i.e. via the first and the last spin / particle ) .    as an important simple but notable class of exactly solvable quantum liouville equations",
    "one can identify open xy spin chains , or open quasi - free fermionic systems ( to which xy chains can be mapped via jordan - wigner transformation ) in general . as it has been shown in @xcite , the quantum liouvillean of a general quadratic system of @xmath1 fermions",
    "can be explicitly diagonalized using the generalized ( non - unitary ) bogoliubov - like transformation , and all the properties of ness and the relaxation process can be computed explicitly in terms of diagonalization of a @xmath2 matrix .",
    "the main conceptual tool in this approach is the introduction of the fock - space structure over the space of operators which the density matrix is a member of .",
    "this method has been later generalized also to more general redfield master equations @xcite and put to a more rigorous mathematical footing @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that explicit solution for the ness density matrix can be found also in some cases which go beyond quasi - free models , e.g. in xx spin 1/2 chain with on - site dephasing noise @xcite or in the xxz spin 1/2 chain for the extremal ( strong ) driving @xcite . on the side of numerical methods , the liouville space version of the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group @xcite",
    "was successfully implemented to simulate steady states of open quantum chains @xcite .",
    "for some other related explicit results on open quantum chains see e.g. refs.@xcite .",
    "as it has been shown in @xcite , an open xy chain ( either in the local lindblad or redfield @xcite setting ) exhibits a quantum phase transition from exponentially decaying correlations to long range order in ness when the ( bulk ) parameters of the model are varied . although a simple heuristic picture in terms of dispersion relation of the quasi - particle normal modes has been proposed to explain the transition , the precise mathematical and physical understanding remained lacking . in this paper",
    "we show that the non - equilibrium transition can be explained with explicit analytical calculation in the special regime of _ small anisotropy _",
    ", where the perturbation theory in the anisotropy parameter can be successfully applied .",
    "we note that the small anisotropy open xy chain has been recently also studied numerically in terms of the keldysh formalism @xcite , where the non - equilibrium phase transition has been re - confirmed .",
    "even though being surprisingly simple , our results analytically reproduce all the features of the transition to long range order under the additional assumption of weak coupling to the baths : namely we ( i ) give explicit expression for the 2-point correlation function , ( ii ) evaluate the decay rate of the correlation function in the short - range regime , and ( iii ) predict a new phenomenon in the long - range regime , the so called _ resonances _ of the correlation function at particular discrete values of the bulk parameter , e.g. the transverse magnetic field . at these resonant values of the magnetic field , in the long range order regime",
    ", the response of the system to external driving is particularly large as characterized by spontaneous emergence of strong correlations over large distances .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the main concepts of quantization in the fock space of operators , write down explicit equations of motion , and derive the so - called lyapunov equation , as the dynamical equation for the 2-point correlation function which completely determines ness .",
    "we stress that the results of this section represent certain simplification and improvements over the formulation of the previous papers @xcite , namely we write for the first time a uniform quadratic form for the liouvillean which remains valid in both , _ even _ and _ odd parity _ sectors of the operator space .",
    "this we do with a small trick , a simple redefinition of the canonical majorana maps over the operator space . in section 3",
    "we then solve perturbatively , uniformly in two small parameters , the anisotropy and the system - bath coupling strength , the lyapunov equation for the correlation ( or covariance ) matrix for the nearly isotropic open xy chain .",
    "we finally discuss our results and conclude in section 4 .",
    "in this section we make a very brief review of the technique of liouvillean diagonalization of quadraric fermi systems in the fock space of operators @xcite with an emphasis on the equation of motion and real - time dynamics .",
    "we treat a finite system with @xmath1 fermionic degrees of freedom , described by @xmath3 anti - commuting hermitian operators @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the redfield master equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) ] @xmath6 serves us as the most general ( markovian ) equation of motion that we are able to treat @xcite ( quantum liouville equation ) .",

    "explicit solution is found by means of perturbation theory using two main assumptions : ( i ) small anisotropy ( @xmath101 ) , and ( ii ) weak coupling ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "hence , the matrix @xmath82 can be decomposed into three parts @xmath103 the first one is essentially the ( isotropic ) xx hamiltonian , the second one is its anisotropic part , and the last one comes from the coupling to the environment ( @xmath104 ) @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a @xmath107 identity matrix and @xmath108 and @xmath109 are @xmath107 matrices @xmath110 note that the matrices @xmath111 are anti - hermitian and real ( real and antisymmetric ) , while the matrix @xmath112 is hermitian ( real and symmetric ) .",
    "exact eigenvectors and eigenvalues for such system are rather difficult to calculate , therefore , we use the perturbation theory to incorporate the effects of the environment and the anisotropy .",
    "the unperturbed term ( @xmath113 ) is exactly diagonalizable by the fourier transformation , namely @xmath114 with @xmath115 where a multi - index @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 is introduced in order to label eigenvalues / eigenvectors , and the plus ( @xmath119 ) , or minus ( @xmath120 ) sign , in ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) corresponds to @xmath121 , or @xmath122 , respectively , and @xmath123 .",

    "reasons for this asymmetry will become clear later on when we will calculate the coefficients @xmath98 .",
    "thus , in case of the eigenvalues we need to calculate only the real ( dissipative ) corrections to first order in @xmath92 , although the imaginary corrections from the anti - hermitian part can be much larger ( as we have assumed @xmath102 ) @xmath127 \\sin ^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi   j}{n+1}\\right ) , \\quad\\omega=1,2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the correction is positive for both , positive and negative imaginary unperturbed eigenvalues ( energies ) @xmath128 .",
    "in contrast to eigenvalues , as already noted , important corrections to eigenvectors come from the anti - hermitian part @xmath129 ( because of the assumption @xmath102 ) and are calculated by the usual first order perturbation theory @xmath130 with @xmath131 long but straightforward calculation shows that all the matrix elements of @xmath129 connecting the vectors with the same polarization ( i.e. vectors @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath134 , and @xmath117 ) vanish . neglecting environment correction of eigenvectors has a convenient consequence , namely , the approximate left and right eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath82 are identical . note , importantly , that in this approach the anisotropy @xmath135 must be smaller than @xmath136 , @xmath137 , where @xmath136 is the smallest spacing between adjacent unperturbed eigenvalues @xmath138 ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) which can be estimated as @xmath139 .",
    "thus a conservative estimate for the validity of our calculations requires @xmath140 , otherwise the degenerate perturbation theory must be used because the difference of the nearest eigenvalues can become smaller than the corrections to the eigenvalues .",
    "the correlation function to the first order in @xmath135 and zeroth order in @xmath92 may be written as a double sum @xmath141 with expansion coefficients calculated from equation ( [ coefeq ] ) @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 here an explanation why we used only the environment ( hermitian ) corrections to the eigenvalues is in order .",
    "let us first consider the unperturbed matrix @xmath113 and the anisotropy ( @xmath135 ) correction @xmath129 .",
    "both are real anti - symmetric matrices , hence , the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath145 come in pairs , where one eigenvalue is positive imaginary and the other one is equally imaginary negative . therefore , by considering only @xmath135-correction we find singularities in the expression ( [ coefeq1 ] ) , and the condition for the uniqueness of ness ( [ conditioneq ] ) is not satisfied as well .",
    "if we include the symmetric ( hermitian ) , environment part @xmath146 , anti - symmetry of @xmath147 is broken and the relation ( [ coefeq1 ] ) becomes regular for all @xmath148 and @xmath149 . we conclude that the environment ( @xmath92 ) corrections to eigenvalues are necessary to get a unique ness .    now we will show that indeed only environment corrections to the unperturbed eigenvalues are needed in order to get the correct correlation function when the inequalities @xmath124 are satisfied",
    ". in this regime the coefficients ( [ coeflambdaeq ] ) are negligible unless @xmath150 , which is true for @xmath151 and @xmath152 . in this case also all @xmath135 corrections to @xmath153 come in pairs , as discussed before , and thus add up to zero in the denominator of ( [ coeflambdaeq ] ) , but we have @xmath154 , which remains the only term in the denominator .",
    "therefore the small parameter @xmath92 cancels out of the equation .",
    "hence , only first order environment ( @xmath92 ) correction to the eigenvalues is needed to calculate the ",

    "the largest coefficients are found to be constant ( i.e. independent of @xmath96 ) @xmath156 and all the other coefficients vanish in the leading order , i.e. are @xmath157 .",
    "the correlation matrix can now be expressed with a single sum @xmath158 the error of the previous formula is @xmath159 , thus , factors which involve a direct product of first order corrections are of higher order and are left out .",

    "first , we observe that analytic properties of the expression @xmath164 in ( [ eq : cx ] ) change at @xmath165 .",
    "namely , for @xmath166 , the expression ( [ eq : cx ] ) for @xmath167 is analytic for any @xmath1 and can be evaluated asymptotically for large @xmath1 giving exponential decay of the correlator @xmath168 where @xmath169 , with the correlation length @xmath170 in fig .",
    "[ mu_h : fig ] , where we show analytically and numerically calculated correlation lengths @xmath171 , one can clearly see vary good agreement of the explicit formula ( [ mu_h : eq ] ) with the numerical calculations , and the square - root singularity of the correlation length at the critical field @xmath172 , @xmath173 .    in the other regime , @xmath174 ,",
    "the formula ( [ eq : analyt ] ) can be further simplified in the poles of the correlation function ( or poles of the coefficients @xmath164 ) , where the above non - degenerate perturbation theory fails .",

    "several interesting remarks are in order .",
    "firstly , we note that in resonances the correlation function @xmath224 ( [ eq : cy ] ) does not depend on the anisotropy @xmath135 , however the use of perturbative arguments indicates that this is true only for small @xmath135 , i.e. @xmath137 . as noted before , for larger but still small anisotropies @xmath225 degenerate perturbation theory must be used as some pair of unperturbed eigenvalues @xmath138 may become nearly degenerate .",
    "in other words , for fixed small anisotropy , our results are quantitatively valid only up to a maximal size @xmath226 . however , numerical calculations ( see fig .  [",
    "gamma_dep : fig ] ) indicate that this estimate is too conservative , in fact @xmath135 can be as large as @xmath227 for our results to remain valued .",
    "this means that , in practice , @xmath136 can be estimated as an _ average spacing _ between eigenvalues ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) , rather than the more conservative _ minimal spacing_. nevertheless , the fact that we can not extend our calculation to thermodynamic limit @xmath228 for any fixed system parameters implies that our method can not be used to describe the critical closing of liouvilean spectral gap behavior as observed in @xcite .",
    "secondly , we stress again an interesting fact that for small reservoir coupling strength @xmath92 our leading order perturbative results do not depend on @xmath92 , meaning for example that the value of the spin - spin correlation at long distance in the regime @xmath229 is insensitive to @xmath92 even for infinitesimal coupling , but there is , however , dependence on the properties of the baths ( e.g. effective temperature , chemical potential , etc ) as encoded in parameter @xmath230 .",
    "we note that in the models of symmetric out - of - equilibrium driving at infinite temperature ( e.g. @xcite ) , where formally @xmath231 , one obtains a different result : @xmath232 . with increasing @xmath92 , our results remain valid - due to our perturbative assumptions - up to @xmath233 .",
    "this is illustrated with simple numerical calculations in fig .",
    "[ eps : fig ] .    the last point we make concerns the total number @xmath234 of resonant values of the magnetic field @xmath235 for a given chain length @xmath1 .",
    "a simple inspection of the formula ( [ eq : res ] ) with the constraint that @xmath183 should be _ odd _ , results in an expression for the resonance counting number @xmath236 if we consider only the values of the field with a fixed , say positive sign , @xmath237 , then the number of resonances is @xmath238 .",
    "this amounts to , for example , in total of @xmath239 resonances shown in fig .",

    "the dashed curves show numerically obtained @xmath208 .",
    "the solid curves show @xmath209 , where the thick curves correspond to numerical results and the thin ones to analytical calculation , and the blue , and gray , circles corresponds to analytically predicted @xmath208 , and @xmath209 , at the resonance field , respectively .",

    "horizontal thin lines are calculated from the equation ( [ eq : cy ] ) and the diagonal ( dashed ) thin line from the formula ( [ eq : cxr1111 ] ) . ]     versus the reservoir coupling strength @xmath92 , and for two different values of anisotropy @xmath246 ( black , orange , respectively ) indicated with vertical dashed lines .",

    "the present article contains two main results .",
    "firstly , using the quantization in the fock space of operators ( ` third quantization ' ) we have derived manifestly bilinear form of the many - body liouvillean and expressed the equation of motion for the 2-point correlation function in terms of the continuous lyapunov equation . secondly , we have presented explicit analytical result for the steady state correlations in boundary driven open xy spin 1/2 chain in the lindblad formulation .",
    "the two regimes of short range and long range correlations have been clearly identified , with the non - equilibrium phase transition occurring at the critical value of transverse magnetic field @xmath249 . in the short range regime ,",
    "exponent of correlation decay has been obtained analytically , whereas in the regime of long range order , a particular resonant spikes of the correlation response of the system have been identified , where the values of the correlator ( scaling with the inverse of the chain length @xmath1 ) have been calculated in a simple closed form .",
    "we note that our analysis could perhaps be extended to the case of large ( or better to say , non - small ) anisotropies , where the continuous limit ( for @xmath228 ) of the lyapunov equation of the xy model becomes a non - homogeneous helmholtz equation driven by two point - like sources representing the two lindblad reservoirs .",
    "the interpretation of the non - equilibrium phase transition in this picture becomes rather obvious , namely long - range order corresponds to positive energies and real wave numbers , whereas short range phase correspond to negative energies and imaginary ( evanescent ) wavenumbers .",
    "the correlation resonances can then be exactly identified with the eigenstates of a square - shaped quantum billiard ( with an appropriate symmetry / boundary contition ) .",
    "nevertheless , the exact analytical results for the correspondence between the open ( strongly anisotropic ) xy chain and the driven helmholtz equation remains a work in progress .",
    "we hope that our results , which are nontrivial though surprisingly simple , may be relevant and observable in real laboratory experiments .",
