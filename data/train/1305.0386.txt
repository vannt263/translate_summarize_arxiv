    "since the theory of nucleation phenomena was introduced a long time ago @xcite , the question under which conditions the `` conventional theory '' of nucleation is accurate has been debated ( see e.g. @xcite ) and this debate continues until today . for the simplest case of homogeneous nucleation ( by statistical fluctuations in the bulk ) of a one - component liquid droplet from the vapor , the basic statement of the theory",
    "is that under typical conditions nucleation processes are rare events , where a free energy barrier @xmath0 very much larger than the thermal energy @xmath4 is overcome , and hence the nucleation rate is given by an arrhenius law , @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the number of nuclei , i.e. droplets that have much larger radii @xmath7 than the critical radius @xmath1 associated with the free energy barrier @xmath0 of the saddle point in configuration space , that are formed per unit volume and unit time ; @xmath8 is a kinetic prefactor .",
    "now @xmath0 is estimated from the standard assumption that the formation free energy of a droplet of radius @xmath7 can be written as a sum of a volume term @xmath9 , and a surface term @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 since the liquid droplet can freely exchange particles with the surrounding vapor , it is natural to describe its thermodynamic potential choosing the chemical potential @xmath12 and temperature @xmath13 as variables , and expand the difference in thermodynamic potentials of liquid and vapor at the coexistence curve , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denoting the densities of the coexisting vapor ( @xmath17 ) and liquid ( @xmath18 ) phases . according to the capillarity approximation ,",
    "the curvature dependence of the interfacial tension @xmath19 is neglected , @xmath19 is taken for a macroscopic and flat vapor - liquid interface . then the critical radius @xmath1 follows from @xmath20 and the associated free energy barrier is @xmath21 however , since typically @xmath22 is less than 100 @xmath4 , the critical droplet is a nanoscale object , and thus the treatment eqs .  - is questionable .",
    "experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) were not able to yield clear - cut results on the validity of eqs .  - , and",
    "how to improve this simple approach : critical droplets are rare phenomena , typically one observes only the combined effect of nucleation and growth ; also the results are often `` contaminated '' by heterogeneous nucleation events due to ions , dust , etc .",
    "@xcite , and since @xmath6 varies rapidly with the supersaturation , only a small window of parameters is suitable for investigation .",
    "therefore this problem has been very attractive , in principle , for the study via computer simulation .",
    "however , despite numerous attempts ( e.g.  @xcite ) , this approach is also hampered by two principal difficulties :    * computer simulations can often only study a small number of decades in time , @xcite , which in typical cases correspond to small barriers @xmath23 rather than the larger ones which are of more interest in the context of experiments .",
    "* on the atomistic scale , it is a difficult and not generally solved problem to decide which particles belong to a droplet and which particles belong to its environment ; the vapor - liquid interface is diffuse and fluctuating @xcite .    for these reasons , many of the available simulation studies have addressed nucleation in the simplistic ising ( lattice gas ) model , @xcite , first of all since it can be very efficiently simulated , and secondly because one can define more precisely what is meant by a `` cluster '' .",
    "associating ising spins @xmath24 at a lattice site @xmath25 with a particle , @xmath26 with a hole , originally `` clusters '' were defined as groups of up - spins such that each up - spin in a cluster has at least one up - spin as nearest neighbor belonging to the same cluster @xcite .",
    "however , now it is well understood that these `` geometrical clusters '' in general do not have much physical significance @xcite : e.g. , it is known that there exists a line of percolation transitions , where a geometrical cluster of infinite size appears , in the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "this percolation transition is irrelevant for statistical thermodynamics of the model @xcite .",
    "based on the work of fortuin and kasteleyn @xcite on a correlated bond - percolation model , it is now understood that physically relevant clusters in the ising model should not simply be defined in terms of spins having the same orientation and are connected by nearest neighbor bonds , as is the case in the `` geometrical clusters '' , but in addition one has to require the bonds to be `` active '' : bonds are `` active '' with probability @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 being the ising model exchange constant .",
    "due to eq .",
    ", the `` physical clusters '' defined in this way are typically smaller than the geometrical clusters , and their percolation point can be shown to coincide with the critical point @xcite .",
    "a geometrical cluster hence can contain several physical clusters .",
    "note that to apply eq .  , random numbers are used , and hence physical clusters are not deterministically defined from the spin configuration , but rather have some stochastic character .",
    "this presents a slight difficulty in using physical clusters in the study of cluster dynamics .",
    "while eq .   has been used in the context of simulations of critical phenomena in the ising model , applying very efficient swendsen - wang @xcite and wolff @xcite simulation algorithms , this result has almost always been ignored in the context of simulations of nucleation phenomena @xcite . while it is allright to ignore the difference between geometrical and physical clusters in the limit @xmath30 ( obviously @xmath31 then , all bonds becoming active ) , this is completely inappropriate at higher temperatures .",
    "the present work hence reconsiders this problem , studying both dynamical aspects of nucleation in the framework of the kinetic ising model @xcite ( without conservation laws ) , and the static properties of large droplets , applying the definition of `` physical clusters '' based on eq .   throughout . for comparison",
    ", we shall also occasionally use the `` geometrical '' cluster definition , to demonstrate that misleading conclusions would actually result in practice , for the temperatures that are commonly studied .",
    "the study will be generalized to ising systems with free surfaces , where a boundary field @xmath32 acts @xcite .",
    "first of all , in this way also a systematic investigation of heterogeneous nucleation at planar walls becomes feasible ; secondly , due to the reduction of the barrier @xmath33 in comparison to @xmath34 ; nucleation for reasonably large values of @xmath1 becomes accessible to study .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we consider the equilibrium of the lattice gas model for @xmath35 in systems in a @xmath36 geometry with periodic boundary conditions , to show that physical clusters do occupy precisely the volume predicted by the lever rule analysis , @xcite as they should when the thermodynamic limit is approached .",
    "we present evidence that physical clusters are correctly identified by both the lever rule method and the approach based on the `` atomistic '' identification of clusters based on eq .   at all temperatures , from zero temperature up to the critical temperature @xmath37 .",
    "in contrast , eq . , which implies a spherical droplet shape , is found to work only at temperatures distinctly above the interface roughening transition temperature @xmath38 @xcite , even for very large radii @xmath7 .",
    "we attribute these discrepancies to the fact that due to the anisotropy of the interface tension for our lattice model pronounced deviations of the average droplet shape from a sphere occur @xcite , presenting data on the shape of large droplets . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we describe our results on the dynamics of the droplet size distribution and on the attempt to find @xmath1 from the size where growth and shrinking processes of clusters are balanced .",
    "this study is also carried out for systems with a free surface , for which the contact angles for various values of the surface field have been estimated previously @xcite , since in this case much lower barriers ( for large clusters ) result , which is crucial for making this study feasible with manageable effort . however , the radii @xmath1 predicted from this analysis of kinetics show slight deviations from the radii @xmath1 predicted from @xmath33 .",
    "possible reasons for this discrepancy will be discussed .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "as is obvious from eq .   and the reasoning behind it , this approach is adequate when one deals with the description of macroscopically large domains in equilibrium with a surrounding bulk phase .",
    "however , one needs to find an extension of the concept that can be applied also to nanoscopically small droplets , `` clusters '' in the lattice gas model that contain perhaps only of the order of 100 fluid particles . in this section , we want to confirm the idea that one must use the concept of `` physical clusters '' based on eq .   for this purpose , rather than the `` geometrical clusters '' that are so widely used when the lattice gas model is used to test nucleation theory concepts . while the geometrical clusters are appropriate if one works at extremely low temperatures where the clusters basically have the shape of small cubes @xcite",
    ", this region clearly is inappropriate when one has the application for vapor - to - liquid nucleation in mind , where droplets are spherical , and their interfaces are rough and fluctuating rather than smooth planar facets . in fact , many studies of nucleation in the lattice gas model have been made in @xmath39 dimensions at temperatures near @xmath40 or thereabout ; given the fact that the interfacial roughening transition of the ising model on the simple cubic lattice is known to occur at about @xcite @xmath41 , i.e. ( note @xmath42 @xcite ) @xmath43 , it is clear that temperatures much closer to @xmath37 must be studied to render the assumption of a spherical droplet shape accurate .",
    "in fact , this assumption of a spherical droplet shape is accurate when the difference between the interfacial stiffness @xcite and the interfacial free energy becomes negligibly small .",
    "numerical studies of hasenbusch and pinn @xcite indicate that this is only the case for @xmath44 . as a consequence ,",
    "it is clear that most of the existing studies of nucleation phenomena in the ising model , that were based on geometrically defined clusters , and had to be done at much lower temperatures , are inconclusive : the deviation of the average droplet shape from a sphere enhances the surface term in eq .  ; but the fluctuation corrections discovered for small droplets by the `` lever rule method '' @xcite show that @xmath45 for small @xmath7 and hence the surface term in eq .",
    "is decreased .",
    "thus , it hardly can be a surprise that some of the studies concluded that the nucleation barriers predicted by classical nucleation theory and the capillarity approximation ( that ignores the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath46 are too high , and others concluded they are too low , or even reported good agreement .",
    "we take the latter finding as indication that the two opposing effects have accidentally more or less canceled each other .",
    "this problem is the motivation for the present section , which attempts to show that `` physical clusters '' based on eq .",
    "are appropriate to identify clusters in the lattice gas model , irrespective of temperature and cluster size , and are equivalent to the droplets of the `` lever rule method '' , for large enough droplets .",
    "[ fig1 ] recalls this approach : one samples for a system of volume @xmath47 the effective thermodynamic potential @xmath48 per lattice site as a function of density @xmath49 , @xmath50/v\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the number of occupied lattice sites ( @xmath52 with @xmath53 the spin variable at lattice site @xmath25 ) .",
    "since phase coexistence between bulk liquid ( at density @xmath16 ) and vapor ( at density @xmath15 ) occurs at a chemical potential @xmath54 that corresponds to the `` field '' ( in magnetic notation ) @xmath55 , @xmath16 and @xmath15 are simply related to the spontaneous magnetization of the ising ferromagnet as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 translates into @xmath12 via @xmath59 .",
    "the accurate sampling of @xmath48 for large @xmath60 is a nontrivial task , it requires the use of advanced methods such as `` multicanonical monte carlo '' @xcite or `` wang landau sampling '' @xcite or `` successive umbrella sampling '' @xcite , see @xcite for background on such techniques . from eq .",
    ", one defines a chemical potential function as a derivative , @xmath61 one recognizes that the isotherms @xmath62 vs.  @xmath49 exhibit a loop : the homogeneous vapor remains stable also for some region where @xmath63 , until a peak occurs , which indicates the `` droplet evaporation / condensation transition '' @xcite : in the first regime where @xmath64 decreases with @xmath49 , a ( more or less spherical or cubical ) droplet coexists with surrounding vapor .",
    "here , we are not interested in the further transitions that one can recognize from this curve , where the droplet changes shape from spherical to cylindrical , or to a slab configuration , etc . @xcite .",
    "instead , we emphasize the key idea of the `` lever rule method '' : one can identify a range of choices for the chemical potential @xmath12 where three states of the finite system can exist in equilibrium with the same chemical potential , namely a homogeneous vapor at density @xmath65 , a homogeneous liquid at density @xmath66 , and a state where two - phase coexistence between the droplet and surrounding vapor occurs .",
    "since the vapor in this case exists at the same chemical potential as the pure vapor , it must be of the same physical nature as the state with density @xmath67 , and similarly , the liquid in the droplet can be identified with the liquid at @xmath68 .",
    "making now use of the fact that for large enough systems a system can be suitably decomposed into independent subsystems , we write for the free energy , with @xmath69 the volume taken by the droplet , @xmath70 , @xmath71 where the free energy densities @xmath72 and @xmath73 are explicitly known , and also @xmath48 is known : thus , when the droplet volume @xmath69 is known , the surface free energy @xmath74 of the droplet , which is defined via eq .  , is determined .",
    "a similar decomposition can readily be written down for the particle number , @xmath75 where we have allowed for an excess number @xmath76 of particles , to be associated with the interface .",
    "if we consider the definition of an `` equimolar dividing surface '' @xcite , @xmath77 , and then reading off @xmath67 and @xmath68 from the construction in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we see that eq .   readily yields @xmath78 and @xmath69 for the considered density @xmath49 , and via eq .",
    "we can immediately extract @xmath74 from the data .",
    "note that these arguments do not invoke the assumption that the dividing surface needs to be a sphere .",
    "if one makes the assumption , @xmath79 , and then one can write also @xmath80 .",
    "thus , it is assumed that all interactions of particles inside the droplet ( volume region @xmath69 ) with particles inside the vapor ( volume region @xmath78 ) are restricted to the interfacial region , and hence can be accounted for by their contribution to the surface free energy @xmath74 .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    however , the method defined via eqs .  , , and illustrated in fig .  [ fig1 ] becomes difficult to apply for very large droplets , because the sampling of @xmath48 then becomes unreliable or would require an unaffordable effort .",
    "the method is also difficult to apply for small droplets , because then one must use relatively small simulation boxes to ensure the stability of the inhomogeneous state where a droplet coexists with surrounding vapor @xcite .",
    "thus , it is very desirable to complement the approach by a more `` microscopic '' identification of droplets , and this is possible via eq .  .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that apart from finite size effects ( see e.g. @xcite ) that for @xmath81 the spontaneous magnetization of the ising ferromagnet @xmath82 coincides with the percolation probability @xmath83 , which is defined @xcite as the fraction of sites belonging to the largest `` physical cluster '' in the system .",
    "when we hence analyze a configuration at a density @xmath49 , where ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) a large cluster is present in the system , using eq .   to define clusters",
    "the largest cluster will include @xmath18 sites , which we hence can associate with its ( total ) magnetization @xmath84 where @xmath85 is then the magnetization per site ( note that the ising magnet / lattice gas isomorphism implies that @xmath86 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "we can obtain the droplet volume @xmath69 from a `` measurement '' of the average size @xmath87 of the largest cluster in the system via @xmath88 note that this volume in general differs from the volume of a geometrical cluster : if @xmath89 counts all occupied sites belonging to the geometrical cluster , and noting that the density in a large geometrical cluster is just the bulk density , namely @xmath90 , the volume taken by the geometrical cluster is given by @xmath91 in the limit @xmath92 , where also @xmath87 and @xmath69 get macroscopically large , @xmath85 tends to @xmath82 , while for finite @xmath60 it is clear that @xmath85 slightly exceeds @xmath82 ( and @xmath68 exceeds @xmath16 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , recording the relation @xmath93 [ or the equivalent relation @xmath94 of the ising ferromagnet ] very precisely is an easy task , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , since both states at densities @xmath95 ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) are homogeneous , not affected by heterophase fluctuations , and since the temperatures studied are still well below @xmath37 , statistical fluctuations are small , and finite size effects are negligible . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] presents representative results for both @xmath96 and @xmath97 versus @xmath98 .",
    "note we also have used the lattice version of the widom particle insertion method @xcite to record the inverse function @xmath99 from simulations in the canonical ensemble , where @xmath49 was chosen as the independent control variable .",
    "the perfect agreement between both approaches not only serves as a test of the accuracy and correctness of our numerical procedures , but also shows that for the chosen temperatures and linear dimensions finite size effects on states in `` pure '' phases are completely negligible , since finite size effects are known to differ in the two ensembles @xcite , but are not detected here at all .",
    "\\(a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d )    to record @xmath69 as defined in eq .   from the simulations , we performed simulations in the canonical ensemble , choosing various values of @xmath49 , and equilibrate a large droplet coexisting with surrounding vapor .",
    "the initial state is then chosen putting a droplet with the size predicted by the lever rule ( and density @xmath100 ) into the simulation box , which then is carefully equilibrated .",
    "the standard method to simulate the ising model with conserved magnetization ( which corresponds to the lattice gas model in the canonical @xmath101 ensemble ) is the `` spin exchange algorithm '' @xcite .",
    "however , the standard nearest neighbor exchange method implies that any local excess of magnetization ( or density , respectively ) can only relax diffusively , and the resulting `` hydrodynamic slowing down ''",
    "@xcite hampers the fast approach towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "we thus used instead a single spin - flip algorithm in which the total magnetization is restricted to two neighboring values @xmath102 : so if the system has magnetization @xmath103 , flipping a down - spin ( which would mean a transition @xmath104 ) is automatically rejected , and if the system is in the state @xmath105 , flipping of up - spins is forbidden . for large systems ( @xmath106 )",
    "any corrections to a strictly canonical simulation at a magnetization per spin @xmath107 are of order @xmath108 and hence negligible .",

    "these data show that @xmath115 as @xmath81 , irrespective of temperature and density ( in the density region where a droplet not affected by the periodic boundary conditions is present , as explained in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath116 extrapolates to unity for @xmath106 not precisely , but only within some error , is due to the fact that statistical errors affect both the estimation of @xmath87 and of @xmath111 ( via errors in the estimation of @xmath98 and hence @xmath67 ) . as expected , using the proper definition of physical clusters , one can work at arbitrary temperatures , both at @xmath117 ( a ) , @xmath13 slightly above @xmath38 ( b ) or @xmath13 rather close to @xmath37 ( d ) . while in cases ( a ) the simple geometrical cluster definition would also work ,",
    "since essentially all bonds are `` active '' ( @xmath118 is almost unity \\{eq .  } ) , and the non - spherical shape of the clusters does not matter in this context .",
    "but the geometrical cluster definition would clearly break down in case ( d ) due to the proximity of the percolation transition that occurs for geometrical clusters at a density not much larger than those included in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we note from the fact that there always occurs asymptotically in the relation @xmath119 a correction of order @xmath114 , that for physical clusters the assumption @xmath77 , that is often ( but not always @xcite ) made in the lever rule method , does not hold : i.e. , when we assume that @xmath76 is proportional to the surface area of the droplet , we can write @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a geometrical factor @xmath122 for a spherical droplet , @xmath123 for a cube ) , and @xmath124 is an excess density of the particles due to the interface of the droplet . using @xmath111 from eq .   as a first - order estimate in eq .",

    "[ fig3 ] suggest that for `` physical droplets '' in the lattice gas model an appreciable `` interfacial adsorption '' ( as expressed in @xmath129 in eq .  )",
    "occurs , it is of interest to not only study the average volume of the droplets @xmath87 but also their radial density profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it is seen that for radii @xmath7 which are in the range from 10 to 20 lattice constants ( corresponding to droplet volumes in the range from about 4500 to 36000 , so these are already clusters of a mesoscopic size , with a huge nucleation barrier far beyond observation in a simulation of nucleation events or in experiments ) the profiles are very broad , and their width increases slightly with increasing droplet size . for comparison , the prediction for the cluster radius resulting from the widely used standard geometrical definition of clusters",
    "is also included : it happens that this geometrical radius is still fairly close to the correct radius at @xmath130 .",
    "of course , closer to @xmath37 the geometrical cluster definition yields completely unreasonable results , due to the onset of percolation phenomena , and for @xmath131 and @xmath132 , the geometrical radii are indeed unreasonably large .",
    "it is interesting to note ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]d ) that the width of the interfacial profile increases with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "this phenomenon is well - known for planar interfaces and attributed to capillary waves . since for a large droplet",
    "the surface is locally planar , most of the capillary wave spectrum is not affected by the interface curvature .",

    "this can be checked directly by recording contours of constant density in slices of width @xmath147 ( taking into account 3 lattice planes through the droplet s center of mass , parallel to the @xmath148 plane , the @xmath149 plane and the @xmath150 plane , respectively ) . averaging these density contours over several hundred statistically independent observations the plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are obtained .",
    "they are all taken at the same fixed density @xmath151 .",
    "note that for this density , the stable state would be a cylindrical droplet ( stabilized by the periodic boundary conditions ) but for such large systems ( @xmath152 ) the compact droplet shapes shown here ( chosen by an appropriate initial condition ) are always perfectly metastable . at @xmath145 the cubic symmetry of these cross sections through the droplet",

    ". however , it is clear that the two other methods do not give results that are correct for @xmath106 in general : while the method based on the geometric cluster definition still gives essentially correct results at @xmath145 ( not shown here ) , where the distinction between `` geometrical '' and `` physical '' clusters is irrelevant , for temperatures @xmath172 , the volume of geometrical clusters is systematically too large . at @xmath142 ,",
    "the error is as large as 60 to 80% even asymptotically , and for the cluster sizes that were actually studied the overestimation actually is by a factor two to five ( fig .",
    "[ fig7]d ) ! in view of the fact that the geometric cluster definition must break down due to the percolation transition @xcite , this failure is not unexpected , but we are not aware that it ever has been quantified previously . in the regime from @xmath146 to @xmath159 , the error of the geometric cluster volume raises from a few percent to 15 to 40% .",
    "the results obtained from the classical nucleation theory via the `` measurement '' of the supersaturation @xmath98 , on the other hand , yield essentially the correct result at high temperatures ( @xmath173 ) , for all linear dimensions studied , since the data are essentially independent of @xmath60 , and hence @xmath1 , in the considered range .",
    "but it is remarkable that for @xmath130 we find @xmath174 ( fig .  [ fig7]b ) and",
    "for @xmath146 we find @xmath175 ( fig .  [ fig7]a ) . this discrepancy becomes worse at lower temperatures ( e.g.  @xmath176 at @xmath145 [ not shown ] ) , and obviously this discrepancy must be attributed to the orientation dependence of the interfacial free energy and the resulting non - spherical droplet shapes ( fig .",

    "note that due to the spin reversal symmetry of the ising model one can show @xcite that a tolman correction ( @xmath181 ) must be absent for @xmath182 .",

    "so the deviations of the ratio @xmath177 that are seen in fig .  [ fig7 ] can be attributed fully to the deviation of the droplet shape from a perfect sphere , caused by the anisotropy of the interfacial free energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcntvsvlr ] , we now present the ratio of the intercepts @xmath186 for @xmath187 as a function of temperature , since we know that \\{eq .  }",

    "however , for large droplet volume @xmath192 we can write in general @xmath193 when we have assumed that the droplets of different linear dimension @xmath7 ( for @xmath194 ) have the same shape at fixed temperature , so we can write @xmath195 for the droplet volume ( @xmath196 is then formally the volume for @xmath197 ) and the surface area is @xmath198 .",
    "for instance , for a sphere we have @xmath199 and @xmath200 , and for the cube @xmath201 and @xmath202 . minimizing @xmath203 with respect to @xmath192 yields @xmath204 for a general shape , which is in between sphere and cube .",
    "the barrier then can be written as @xmath205 using now the fact that by choosing a particular large droplet volume in our simulation , @xmath58 is automatically fixed for any volume @xmath206 due to the thermal equilibrium situation constructed in our simulation .",
    "so it makes sense to estimate the ratio of barriers as @xmath207 for @xmath190 , we know that @xmath208 is again the interface tension of the planar surface , also used in the classical nucleation theory for the spherical surface .",
    "hence when we write the ratio of @xmath209 , using eq .  , the term @xmath210 cancels , @xmath211 this asymptotic value of @xmath212 should be reached for @xmath213 , while @xmath214 as @xmath215 .",
    "our numerical results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vcntvsvlr ] ) are compatible with this expectation .",
    "we now consider time - dependence of the system where we start the system at time @xmath216 in an equilibrated state in the vapor at @xmath217 , but switch on at time @xmath216 a chemical potential @xmath218 ( or equivalently , a positive magnetic field @xmath58 in the notation of ising ferromagnet ) at which the liquid is the stable phase . as mentioned in the introduction , we consider heterogeneous in addition to homogeneous nucleation , choosing a @xmath219 geometry with two walls at @xmath220 and @xmath221 , choosing surface fields @xmath222 such that @xmath223 favors the vapor but @xmath32 ( acting at the wall at @xmath220 ) favors the liquid .",
    "the reason for this choice is , that by proper choice of @xmath32 one can adjust the contact angle @xmath224 at which sessile wall - attached macroscopic droplets can occur . the barrier against heterogeneous nucleation @xmath225 is predicted to be very much reduced , in comparison to the barrier @xmath34 against homogeneous nucleation ,",
    "if the contact angle is small , since @xcite @xmath226 as shown with the `` lever rule '' method @xcite indeed rather large wall attached droplets can be simulated in equilibrium with supersaturated vapor which have barriers of order @xmath227 or so only , for suitable choices of @xmath32 and @xmath58 , and so a comparison with kinetic studies then seems reachable , and varying @xmath32 over some range provides an additional variable to test the theory .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    as a first step , preliminary runs were performed with the single spin flip metropolis algorithm @xcite monitoring the average lifetime of the metastable vapor .",
    "this was done using a large sample @xmath228 ) of equilibrated initial states at @xmath55 , where the considered field @xmath58 ( or chemical potential @xmath229 , respectively ) was then switched on and the time recorded when the ( initially negative ) magnetization reaches the value @xmath230 for the first time .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows estimates for the resulting mean first passage times for a range of choices of @xmath32 as a function of the field .",
    "when this `` lifetime '' of the state with @xmath231 ( i.e. , vapor ) does not exceed @xmath232 , the system is rather unstable , nucleation occurs fast and is followed by fast domain growth as well ; such fast decays of unstable systems are not suitable for tests of nucleation theory .",
    "it is seen , that in a rather narrow interval of fields @xmath58 ( for each value of @xmath32 ) the lifetime increases from @xmath232 to @xmath233 .",
    "such parameter combinations @xmath234 will be studied in the following only ; if we would study cases where the lifetime is significantly larger than @xmath233 , no critical droplet would be formed during affordable simulation times .",

    "@xmath236 is defined as the average number of physical clusters per lattice site , and we have the sum rule @xmath237 since every site occupied by a particle must be part of some cluster .",

    "@xmath235 is almost constant for at least one , or even several decades of time",
    ". then a decay of these plateau values sets in , which is due to the fact that too many much larger clusters have grown , the volume fraction of the system that is still in the metastable phase shrinks , and so less clusters of intermediate size ( as studied in fig .  [ fig9 ] ) are observed .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) which were based on the geometrical cluster definition , however .",
    "we also remark that in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig9]b the lifetime of the plateau extends up to @xmath241 , one decade only , as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig8]a , since this case corresponds to a `` lifetime '' of the metastable state of only @xmath242 , and it is clear that only times @xmath243 distinctly less than @xmath244 should be analyzed .    while some of the previous work on the studies of the kinetics of cluster growth in metastable ising models ( e.g. @xcite ) tried to use directly @xmath235 to extract information on the validity of nucleation theory concepts , we here try to implement a different concept .",
    "namely , we follow the trajectories of individual ( large ) clusters with respect to their size in time , @xmath245 , where @xmath25 is an index to label individual clusters . to ensure that the @xmath25th cluster at time @xmath246 is actually a descendent of the @xmath25th cluster at the time @xmath243",

    "the set of coordinates @xmath254 is recorded .",
    "note that there occurs the difficulty that the number of large clusters is not constant during the simulation : clusters form and decay or split into parts , and since we know that @xmath255 exceeds @xmath18 for each cluster , and the assignment of the `` active bonds '' according to eq .   to identify from the geometrical cluster the associate physical clusters is a random process , some random shift of @xmath256 would occur even if we carry out two successive cluster identifications from the same spin configuration @xmath257 ) . of course , such shifts should be small in comparison with @xmath258 , but as @xmath247 is chosen nonzero it is clear that useful results are only obtained if @xmath247 is small enough , and @xmath18 is large in comparison to clusters that correspond to typical thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "hence only clusters for which @xmath259 are considered ( for the temperature @xmath130 we chose arbitrarily @xmath260 ) .",
    "so if by such criteria ( for details see @xcite ) it is ensured that the @xmath25th cluster with size @xmath261 is a descendent of the @xmath25th cluster with size @xmath253 at time @xmath243 , we can define a reaction rate @xmath262 as @xmath263}{\\delta t } \\right\\rangle _ { \\ell_i(t)}\\ ] ] here the index @xmath253 stands for an average over a sampling of all cluster trajectories recorded in the simulation , and a smoothing procedure of the ( otherwise too noisy ) data with a triangular smoothing function @xcite was applied .",
    "of course , in order to collect statistically significant data on @xmath264 , it is necessary to perform many runs for each parameter combination @xmath265 that is studied .",
    "we observe that the lifetime of the metastable stale in such runs is fluctuating dramatically , and so it is necessary to choose the run time of each run individually , rather than the same for all runs .",
    "it was decided to stop each run automatically when the largest cluster size @xmath266 was reached .",
    "of course , then only clusters with @xmath267 could be studied , to avoid artifacts caused by this cutoff .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    while eq .",
    "is based on using all clusters @xmath268 at each time @xmath243 , one can simplify matters by restricting the analysis only to the trajectory of the biggest cluster in the system @xcite .",
    "when one does this , one ignores possible problems from the fact that from time to time the identity of the largest cluster changes .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows now typical results for @xmath264 , using both this latter approximation and the method based on eq .  .",
    "both methods yield similar trends , although they differ somewhat in detail ( particularly in the case of homogeneous nucleation in the bulk ) .",
    "\\(a ) + ( b )    what one expects theoretically for @xmath264 is a monotonous increase of @xmath264 with @xmath18 , where @xmath264 is negative for clusters smaller than the critical cluster size @xmath3 while @xmath264 is positive for @xmath269 .",
    "the method yields a second positive part for @xmath18 slightly larger than @xmath270 .",

    ", we obtain the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "it is seen that for a given value of the field @xmath58 ( or @xmath229 , respectively ) classical nucleation theory underestimates the volume of the critical cluster : in other words , a given volume @xmath272 leads to a larger value of @xmath58 . since ( according to classical nucleation theory and eq .  )",
    "the barriers scale as @xmath273 , this means when one studies nucleation barriers as function of cluster volume @xmath272 or cluster radius @xmath1 , one finds lower barriers in the simulation rather than predicted .",
    "qualitatively , the data from the present analysis of cluster kinetics confirm the findings from the lever rule method of winter et al .",
    "@xcite , as far as homogeneous nucleation is concerned ( fig .",
    "[ fig11]a ) , although some questions on systematic errors in both methods have not been fully settled .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative agreement between these quite different approaches is satisfactory . for the case of heterogeneous nucleation , however , for a given supersaturation the critical cluster volume predicted from cluster kinetics ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) is distinctly larger than the corresponding results from the static methods .",
    "we have no explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "in the present work , we have studied aspects of nucleation theory by simulation of clusters and their dynamics , using the ising ( lattice gas ) model on the simple cubic lattice . both homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation at planar walls ( where a `` surface field '' acts ) have been considered .    although many aspects of this problem have been studied before in works of various groups extending over several decades ,",
    "most of the previous work is inconclusive since it relied on the use of the `` geometric '' cluster definition .",
    "we have given evidence that this geometric cluster definition does not yield correct results for large clusters at the temperatures far above the roughening transition temperature where the clusters have spherical shape ; at temperatures below the roughening transition temperature the geometric clusters and the `` physical clusters '' are basically indistinguishable , but due to the pronounced anisotropy effects a simple analysis of nucleation phenomena is not possible .",
    "however , in the limit of large droplet volumes @xmath274 , where one can neglect any corrections to the decomposition of the droplet formation free energy into the bulk term plus a surface correction , one can compute the nucleation free energy barrier @xmath0 from measuring the excess chemical potential @xmath98 that is in equilibrium with a given @xmath192 . fig .",
    "[ fig : vcntvsvlr ] shows the enhancement of @xmath0 with respect to the standard result for spherical droplets ( using eqs .  ,  ) .",
    "we thus show that in the ising ( lattice gas ) model this enhancement gradually rises from unity as the temperature is lowered from the critical temperature , reaches almost 10% at @xmath275 , and rises steeply below the roughening temperature towards the low temperature limit @xmath276 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vcntvsvlr ] ) .",
    "this enhancement reflects the consequences of the anisotropy of the interfacial free energy , such as the gradual crossover of the droplet shape from a sphere to a cube ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .    on the other hand , we demonstrate that physical clusters do give consistent results , at least in the bulk when one is concerned with homogeneous nucleation .",
    "we show that in the limit where the droplets get macroscopically large , they converge against the simple lever rule predictions .",
    "however , we do find an ( unexpected ) surface excess in the particle number of such clusters also in this case .",
    "we also demonstrate the validity of the relation between chemical potential ( of the supersaturated vapor ) and the droplet radius that classical nucleation theory predicts for large droplets near the critical temperature . we also give evidence that the droplet - vapor interface is broadened due to capillary waves ; we remind the reader that mean - field type theories and density functional theories @xcite can not include such capillary wave effects ( which also should give rise to a correction term on the droplet formation free energy ,",
    "not yet included in eq .  ) .",
    "we would also like to stress that many of our considerations can be carried over to a study of clusters in @xmath277 dimensions , where a construction as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] also holds . however , we expect two distinctions : ( i ) the roughening transition temperature @xmath38 is zero , so the crossover of droplet shape from the circle to the square occurs without any singularity even for arbitrarily large droplets .",
    "( ii ) percolation coincides with the critical point , but geometrical clusters still are too large , and to describe nucleation , physical clusters defined via eq .",
    "should also be used . of course",
    ", it would be very desirable to carry these considerations over to nucleation in off - lattice models of fluids .",
    "however , a precise analogue of eq .   is still not known , and hence other concepts to define physical clusters @xcite need to be used , if one wishes to study nucleation near the critical point .    in the second part we present a first study of the time evolution of the cluster population based on the `` physical cluster '' definition .",
    "however , due to the large computer resources needed for this study , only data at a single temperature ( @xmath130 ) are presented . in order to allow a comparison of this part of the study with our results on static properties of critical droplets ,",
    "as studied in the first part of the paper , we use a criterion to estimate the critical droplet size from the balance between droplet growth and shrinking processes . in the case of homogeneous nucleation ,",
    "the results obtained in this way are roughly compatible with the results obtained from the static lever rule method . studying droplet volumes in the range from 100 to 200 , clear deviations from the classical nucleation theory are seen , which can be attributed to a decrease of the nucleation barrier due to fluctuation effects . however , in the case of heterogeneous nucleation , a rather large discrepancy between the results of the statics and dynamics of droplets is found .",

    "<S> the conventional theory of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation in a supersaturated vapor is tested by monte carlo simulations of the lattice gas ( ising ) model with nearest - neighbor attractive interactions on the simple cubic lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the theory considers the nucleation process as a slow ( quasi - static ) cluster ( droplet ) growth over a free energy barrier @xmath0 , constructed in terms of a balance of surface and bulk term of a `` critical droplet '' of radius @xmath1 , implying that the rates of droplet growth and shrinking essentially balance each other for droplet radius @xmath2 . for heterogeneous nucleation at surfaces , </S>",
    "<S> the barrier is reduced by a factor depending on the contact angle . using the definition of `` physical '' clusters based on the fortuin - kasteleyn mapping , </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependence of the cluster size distribution is studied for `` quenching experiments '' in the kinetic ising model , and the cluster size @xmath3 where the cluster growth rate changes sign is estimated . </S>",
    "<S> these studies of nucleation kinetics are compared to studies where the relation between cluster size and supersaturation is estimated from equilibrium simulations of phase coexistence between droplet and vapor in the canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potential is estimated from a lattice version of the widom particle insertion method . for large droplets </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the `` physical clusters '' have a volume consistent with the estimates from the lever rule . </S>",
    "<S> `` geometrical clusters '' ( defined such that each site belonging to the cluster is occupied and has at least one occupied neighbor site ) yield valid results only for temperatures less than 60% of the critical temperature , where the cluster shape is non - spherical . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the chemical potential can be used to numerically estimate @xmath0 also for non - spherical cluster shapes . </S>"
