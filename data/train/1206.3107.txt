    "after the discovery of the mssbauer effect in 1958 , quantitative measurements of relativistic time dilation were carried out in the 1960s based on this effect @xcite-@xcite , and the interest in such measurements lasts to this day @xcite,@xcite . the experiments @xcite-@xcite reported full agreement with the time dilation predicted by einstein s theory of relativity . in the experiments @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "the mssbauer source was placed at the center of a fast rotating disk and an absorber at the rim of the disk . in the analyses of these experiments ,",
    "it was assumed that the absorption line of the rotating absorber stays lorentzian with same width as at rest , and is shifted only by the time dilation factor .",
    "based on the generalized principle of relativity and the ensuing symmetry , in @xcite it was shown that there are only two possible types of transformations between uniformly accelerated systems . the validity of the _ clock hypothesis _ is crucial to determining which one of the two types of transformations is obtained .",
    "the clock hypothesis , as stated in @xcite , maintains that the rate of an accelerated clock is equal to that of a co - moving unaccelerated clock .",
    "if the clock hypothesis is not true , then the transformation is of lorentz - type and implies the existence of a universal maximal acceleration @xmath1 and an additional time dilation due to the acceleration of the clock . by _ acceleration _",
    ", we mean the proper acceleration defined @xcite as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the proper time . in this case",
    ", it was shown in @xcite that a doppler type shift for an accelerated source will be observed .",
    "this doppler type shift is similar to the doppler shift due to the velocity of the source .",
    "the formulas for this shift are the same as those for the velocity doppler shift , with @xmath4 replaced by @xmath5 .",
    "consider an absorber placed on a disk , rotating with angular velocity @xmath6 at the distance @xmath7 from the center .",
    "if this absorber is exposed to radiation of frequency @xmath8 through the center of the disk , then , since the velocity of the absorber is perpendicular to the radiation direction , the radiation will undergo a transverse doppler shift @xmath9 due to the time dilation of the absorber .",
    "if the conjecture about the existence of a shift due to acceleration is true , there will be an additional shift @xmath10 , which is longitudinal , since the acceleration is in the direction of the radiation .",
    "kndig s experiment @xcite measured the transverse doppler shift for a rotating disk by means of the mssbauer effect . in ( only )",
    "this experiment , the absorption line of the rotating absorber was obtained .",
    "this experiment , as reanalyzed by kholmetskii _",
    "et al _ @xcite , showed a significant deviation of about @xmath11 of the shift observed from the one predicted by special relativity .",
    "this deviation was explained in @xcite by the additional shift due to the acceleration .",
    "moreover , the value of the maximal acceleration @xmath1 was estimated to be about @xmath12 .",
    "this value of the maximal acceleration implies that the ratio of the new shift ( due to acceleration ) to the transversal one due to the velocity is @xmath13 where @xmath7 is the distance ( @xmath14 in @xcite ) of the absorber from the center of the disk .",
    "kndig s experiment was not designed to test the acceleration shift , and the recalculation by kholmetskii _ et al _ is not direct .",
    "thus , the corrected kndig s result may serve only as an indication of the existence of a maximal acceleration and an estimate of its value .",
    "note that in other time dilation experiments , the value of @xmath7 was about @xmath15 , implying that the ratio of the new shift to the known one is @xmath16 .",
    "how was such a deviation not observed in @xcite-@xcite ?",
    "the reason for this is that their analyses did not take into account the broadening of the absorption curves during the rotation , as is explained below .",
    "we show here that the absorption line of a rotating mssbauer absorber gets broader during the rotation , even in the case when the absorber moves in the perpendicular direction to the radiation .",
    "this is due to the fact that the slit for the radiation beam leaving the source and the opening slit of the detector must have a finite width .",
    "therefore , the velocity of the absorber is not perpendicular to all individual rays .",
    "hence , these rays undergo a longitudinal doppler shift in addition to the expected transversal one .",
    "this shift is very significant even for very small slits for the radiation beam and for detector , and leads to broadened non - lorentzian absorption lines .",
    "choose the direction of the radiation beam to be in the direction of the @xmath17-axis , and place the origin at center of the source and the detector at @xmath18 .",
    "denote by @xmath19 the velocity of the absorber . in order for the transversal doppler shift @xmath20 to be observed ,",
    "the velocity must be at least @xmath21 a ray leaves the source at the point @xmath22 and enters the detector at a point @xmath23 .",
    "the component of the velocity of the absorber in the direction @xmath24 of the ray , for @xmath25 , is @xmath26 , which may be significant even for very small width of the slits ( 2d in figure 1 ) .",
    "this implies that most rays will also be exposed to a longtitudal doppler shift and will change completely the shape of the mssbauer absorption line .",
    "one should observe a decrease in the absorption amplitude and a non - lorentzian broadening of the absorption spectrum .",
    "we choose again the direction of the radiation beam to be in the direction of the @xmath17-axis .",
    "we place the origin at the center of the rotating disk ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the radiation leaves the source at the point @xmath28 and enters the detector at a point @xmath23 .",
    "the equation of the radiation line is @xmath29 and has the direction @xmath30 , and intersects the @xmath31-axis at the point @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 obviously may have any value between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "denote the distance of the absorber to the center by @xmath7 , and denote the intersection point of our ray with the absorber by @xmath37 .",
    "since this point is on our radiation line , it satisfies the equation @xmath38    the velocity of the absorber at @xmath39 is @xmath40 , where @xmath6 is the angular velocity of the disk .",
    "thus , from equation ( [ absorbpos ] ) , we get that the component of the velocity of the absorber in the direction of the ray is @xmath41 which , for @xmath25 , is approximately equal to @xmath42 , and even then the velocity @xmath43 is extremely large for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in comparison to the natural full width at half absorption intensity ( @xmath46 ) of the @xmath47 mssbauer absorption single line spectrum .    a typical absorption curve is obtained by placing the source on a transducer and moving it with a velocity @xmath48 in the direction of the @xmath17-axis .",
    "this velocity is of order up to several millimeters per second . for such velocities",
    ", we may assume that the source velocity in the radiation direction @xmath24 is approximately equal @xmath49 .",
    "the absorption curve @xmath50 of an absorber rotating with angular velocity @xmath6 describes the rate of the radiation absorbed as a function of the velocity @xmath49 of the source . for a thin absorber with no chemical shift ,",
    "a typical absorption curve for an absorber at rest is a lorentzian function @xmath51 , of half width @xmath0 , absorption amplitude @xmath52 , and resonance at @xmath53 , as the one shown in figure 3a for @xmath54 .    for a rotating absorber , the total doppler shift that the ray undergoes consists of a longitudinal shift due to the relative velocity of the source and the absorber and a transversal shift due to the time dilation of the absorber .",
    "all together are equivalent to a longitudinal shift of a source with velocity @xmath55 since the spread in @xmath43 is increasing with angular velocity , it contributes significantly to the spread of the observed absorption mssbauer line .    using ( [ vn ] ) and ( [ tildets ] )",
    ", the absorption curve of the rotating absorber will be @xmath56 where the integral has to be taken over the source emission intensity at @xmath57 and absorption by detector at @xmath58 .",
    "this curve can be calculated analytically , if we assume that the distributions along @xmath57 and @xmath58 are uniform on interval @xmath59 $ ] , @xmath25 and @xmath60 . under these assumptions @xmath61 . denoting @xmath62 and defining a function @xmath63 such that @xmath64",
    ", we get @xmath65@xmath66 thus , @xmath67    if @xmath68 and @xmath69 , implying that the absorption curve of the rotating absorber will be @xmath70 , which is a shift of the absorption curve of the non - rotating absorber .",
    "this was assumed in the experiments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath71 is symmetric and @xmath72 is symmetric with respect to @xmath73 .",
    "the results of the calculated absorption spectra using equation ( [ absorrotatingabs ] ) , using numerical integration , or using the analytic function ( [ aomega ] ) yield the same results , shown as transmission rate spectra line @xmath74 in figure 3 .",
    "the simulations show that even for small @xmath75 , if @xmath6 becomes large enough the absorption line broadens drastically and even becomes unobservable .",
    "these curves have the same type of widening and shift as the absorption curves obtained experimentally in @xcite .    in the experiments @xcite-@xcite,@xcite ,",
    "the value of @xmath76 was measured only in the case in which the source and the absorber were relatively static , corresponding to @xmath53 . obviously in their experiments",
    "@xmath77 , ( they do not specify ) , and their analysis did not consider the changes in shape of the absorption line as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "thus we can not rely on their conclusions .",
    "if the distributions of source emission intensity is @xmath57 dependent and the detection is @xmath58 dependent , but symmetric in the interval @xmath59 $ ] , one will still observe under the rotation a symmetric broadening .",
    "if the distribution is not symmetric and has non - zero average , we will get an additional shift , but such a shift can be compensated for by reversing the direction of the rotation .    *",
    "conclusions : * in order to measure the transverse doppler shift by conventional msbauer spectroscopy with source mounted on a static transducer and the absorber moving on a fast rotating disc , one should take care of the following :    ( a ) : :    one must measure the full spectrum of the absorption line .",
    "( b ) : :    one must measure this spectrum in both angular directions of the    absorber .",
    "but most important ; ( c ) : :    one must put collimators on source and detector to reduce the slits to    minimal dimensions , which will still allow a spectrum measurement in a    reasonable time span .    only the experiment of w. kndig @xcite",
    "obeyed at least ( a ) and ( b ) . in his experiment he used a source of @xmath78 against a @xmath47 enriched iron absorber .",
    "thus both were almost identical and in both the iron nuclei were exposed to a strong magnetic field ( 33 t ) causing the emission and absorption spectra to be composed of six line patterns , which lead to observed multiline spectra as shown in fig.4 ( bottom ) , for various rotational frequencies of the absorber . since kndig scanned the spectra in the range of about -1 to + 1 mm / s , he observed only the central line with reduced intensity and line broadening , as the lines simulated in fig.4 ( middle and top ) .",
    "thus he actually observed the line broadening due to the finite slits , but interpreted them as due to rotor vibrations affecting the absorber .",
    "nevertheless this experiment seems to be still the most accurate transverse doppler shift experiment using the @xmath47 mssbauer effect .",
    "his results with the corrected analysis reported in @xcite indicates that the observed shift in this experiment is larger and deviates @xmath79 from that expected by special relativity theory .",
    "einstein time dilation formula was verified by several experiments @xcite- . in w.",
    "kndig experiment the absorber was exposed to a significant acceleration .",
    "in @xcite it was indicated that the deviation of the shift in the experiment may be due to a longitudinal doppler shift caused by the acceleration of the absorber .",
    "it led to an estimate of a universal maximal acceleration of order @xmath12 and an indication of non - validity of the einstein clock hypothesis @xcite . for a long time ,",
    "b. mashhoon argued against the clock hypothesis and developed nonlocal transformations for accelerated observers ( see the review article @xcite ) .",
    "note that time dilation mssbauer effect experiments have an advantage in identifying relatively small shift due to acceleration , since in these experiments the shift due to the velocity is of second order while the shift due the acceleration is of first order .",
    "thus we recommend mssbauer spectroscopy scientists to perform an accurate experiment measuring the shift of the absorption line for a fast rotating absorber which may reveal a new fundamental law @xcite , with a monumental effect on whole of physics .        h. j. hay _",
