    "elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions measures the asymmetry of particle momentum distributions in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "it results from the initial spatial asymmetry in non - central collisions @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that the elliptic flow is sensitive to the properties of the hot dense matter formed during the initial stage of heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "recently , elliptic flow has been measured at rhic in au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev .",
    "a large elliptic flow of all charged particles near midrapidity was reported by the star collaboration @xcite .",
    "also , the transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow of all charged particles was measured by both the star @xcite and the phenix @xcite collaboration , while those of charged pions , kaons , protons and anti - protons were measured by the star collaboration @xcite .",
    "the experimental results show that the elliptic flow first increases with particle transverse momentum and then levels off .",
    "the dependences of elliptic flow on both the charged particle multiplicity @xcite and the particle pseudorapidity @xcite have also been measured .    to understand these experimental results ,",
    "many theoretical approaches have been used .",
    "these include semi - analytic models @xcite , models with parton energy loss @xcite , hydrodynamic models @xcite , transport models @xcite , and the hybrid model which combines hydrodynamic and hadronic transport models @xcite . among these studies ,",
    "hydrodynamic models usually give the largest elliptic flow and an almost linear increase in its value with the particle transverse momentum below 1.5 gev@xmath1 . in the hybrid model of combining the hydrodynamic model with the rqmd transport model @xcite and choosing certain effective equation of state",
    ", it is possible to obtain an elliptic flow that is comparable to the measured ones in heavy ion collisions at both sps and rhic energies @xcite . in transport models including only the parton cascade , the elliptic flow has been shown to be sensitive to the parton scattering cross section , and a large value can be obtained with a large cross section @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "transport models based on hadronic and/or string degrees of freedom in general give a smaller elliptic flow @xcite than that observed at rhic .",
    "including multi - pomeron exchanges and hard gluon - gluon scatterings can , however , yield a large elliptic flow @xcite .    in this paper , we study the elliptic flow in au+au collisions at rhic using a multiphase transport model ( ampt ) that includes both initial partonic and final hadronic interactions as well as the transition between these two phases of matter @xcite",
    ". in particular , we study the effect due to partons converted from the initial strings in high energy density regions .",
    "in most transport models for heavy ion collisions , such as the art model @xcite , the rqmd model @xcite , and the urqmd model @xcite , initial primary collisions produce either hadrons or strings which later fragment to hadrons . in the hijing model @xcite , on the other hand , initial primary collisions also produce minijet partons which later enter into the string configurations and fragment to hadrons .",
    "these minijet partons are partons produced from initial hard collisions , i.e. , from perturbative qcd processes involving a minimum transverse momentum transfer @xmath2 , which is chosen to be 2 gev@xmath1 in the hijing model to reproduce the @xmath3 and @xmath4 data @xcite .    in the ampt model @xcite , which takes initial conditions from the hijing model , minijet partons first undergo scatterings before fragmenting into hadrons . since the number of hard collisions in an @xmath5 collision roughly scales as @xmath6 and grows faster with colliding energy , while the number of strings roughly scales as @xmath7 , minijets become more important in heavy ion collisions at higher energies . however , for central au+au collisions even at @xmath8 gev minijet partons account for only about 1/3 of the total produced transverse energy , so the effect of parton scattering on the final particle multiplicities and spectra is quite small @xcite .",
    "the above picture of coexisting partons and strings during the initial stage of high energy heavy ion collisions is questionable when the energy density is much higher than the critical density for the qcd phase transition . in this case , the strings are expected to melt into partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "both the transport model @xcite and the high density qcd approach @xcite predict that the initial energy density of produced matter in central au+au collisions at rhic is more than an order of magnitude higher than the critical energy density ( @xmath9 gev/@xmath10 ) . keeping strings in the high energy density region",
    "thus underestimates the partonic effects in these collisions .    to model the string melting in high energy density regions to partons ,",
    "we extend the ampt model in the following way .",
    "after using the hijing model ( with jet quenching turned off ) to produce the initial conditions , we first let strings fragment to hadrons using the lund fragmentation @xcite built in the pythia routine @xcite and then convert these hadrons to partons according to their flavor and spin structure . in particular , a meson is converted to a quark and an anti - quark , while a baryon is converted to three quarks , and an anti - baryon is converted to three anti - quarks , where quark masses are taken as the same as in the pythia program @xcite , e.g. @xmath11 mev , @xmath12 mev , @xmath13 mev .",
    "we further assume that quarks are produced isotropically in the rest frame of the hadron and start to interact only after a proper formation time @xmath14 . in converting hadrons to partons",
    ", hadrons are not assigned a formation time as they are considered as an intermediate step in modeling the melting of strings to partons in an environment of high energy density .",
    "based on the expectation that hard partons ( e.g. those described by perturbative qcd ) are produced early while soft partons are produced late in the process , we take @xmath15 for the parton proper formation time , where @xmath16 is a scale related to the parton transverse momenta . since partons produced from a string through the same intermediate hadron should have the same formation time , the transverse mass of the hadron is thus used for @xmath16 in determining the parton formation time .    the scatterings among these quarks are treated using the parton cascade zpc with the following universal cross section @xcite : @xmath17 in the above , the strong coupling constant @xmath18 is taken to be 0.47 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the standard mandelstam variables for the two - parton elastic scattering process , and the effective screening mass @xmath21 depends on the temperature and density of the partonic matter . in the present study , we shall take @xmath21 as a parameter to obtain the desired total cross section and the corresponding angular distribution .",
    "a parton can hadronize after it stops interacting , i.e. , after it will no longer collide with other partons .",
    "we model the hadronization by combining the nearest two partons into a meson and three partons into a baryon ( or an anti - baryon ) .",
    "as partons freeze out at different times and parton coalescence occurs at different times , the hadronization is treated locally . since combinations of partons form a continuous invariant - mass spectrum but not a discreet one , it is in general impossible to conserve 4-momentum when several partons are combined into a hadron . in our current treatment",
    ", we choose to conserve the 3-momentum and determine the hadron species according to the flavor and invariant mass of coalescing partons .",
    "e.g. , if a @xmath22 and a @xmath23 quark coalesce , a @xmath24 will be formed if the 2-quark invariant mass is closer to the @xmath24 mass , or a @xmath25 will be formed if the 2-quark invariant mass is closer to the central value of the @xmath26 mass @xcite .",
    "all su(3 ) mesons and baryons listed in the hijing program @xcite are included for coalescence except @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which are not present in our hadronic transport model , and @xmath29 states . the resulting hadrons are then given an additional formation time of @xmath30 fm@xmath1 in their rest frame and imported to the art hadronic transport model to take into account their rescatterings @xcite .",
    "we have used the above extended ampt model to study the elliptic flow in au+au collisions at rhic energies .",
    "the elliptic flow here is defined as @xmath32 where the average is performed over all particles . for center - of - mass energy @xmath0 gev and impact parameter @xmath33 fm ,",
    "we show in figs . [ figv2p](a ) and [ figv2p](b ) the time evolution of the elliptic flow of all partons , i.e. , regardless of their formation and freeze - out times , at midrapidity with parton scattering cross sections @xmath34 and 6 mb , respectively .",
    "we note that partons still inside strings and partons which have frozen out are also included in fig .  1 .",
    "for both values of parton cross sections the elliptic flow is seen to develop mostly within the first 5 fm@xmath1 , and both the rate of increase and the final parton @xmath35 are larger for the larger parton cross section . also shown in these figures",
    "are the time evolutions of the parton transverse energy @xmath36 ( scaled down by a factor of 2000 ) , the average transverse energy per parton @xmath37 ( scaled down by 2 ) , and the second moment of the spatial asymmetry determined from the parton positions at their previous interaction points , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "it is seen that for both parton cross sections the absolute value of @xmath39 decreases with time , and its final value is closer to zero in the case of @xmath40 mb .",
    "the final saturation of parton @xmath35 in the partonic phase is due to the lack of scatterings in the limit of small @xmath41 and the vanishing spatial anisotropy in the limit of large @xmath41 .",
    "we also see that the transverse energy at midrapidity decreases by @xmath42 30% within a couple of fm@xmath1 .",
    "since the decrease of parton transverse energy is faster than that for the parton number at midrapidity , the average transverse energy per parton @xmath37 also decreases .",
    "the final saturation of @xmath37 at @xmath42 20% below the initial value reflects the equilibration between the longitudinal and transverse momenta of partons @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ figv2ph ] , we show the time evolution of @xmath35 for active partons , i.e. , partons that have not stopped scatterings , @xmath35 for formed hadrons , the total @xmath35 and @xmath39 including both active partons and formed hadrons , and the number of active partons at midrapidity for collisions at an impact parameter @xmath33 fm and a parton cross section @xmath40 mb . while the initial numbers of active partons are near zero because most partons are not yet formed and thus not yet active , it is seen that the number of active partons peaks within the first fm@xmath1 and decreases by a factor of 2 at about 4 fm@xmath1 due to the hadronization .",
    "the total @xmath35 is thus dominated by active partons at the early stage and by formed hadrons during the later stage of heavy ion collisions .",
    "although the active partons have a large elliptic flow at later times , their number is too small to affect the total elliptic flow .",
    "we have also studied the impact parameter dependence of elliptic flow in au+au collisions at center - of - mass energies of @xmath43 gev . to compare with the centrality dependence in the star data @xcite",
    ", we first divide the impact parameter range @xmath44 fm into six bins with equal bin - size except the first bin , which is taken to be @xmath45 fm .",
    "the impact parameter dependence is then converted to the dependence on @xmath46 by taking @xmath47 as the number of charged particles within the pseudorapidity range @xmath48 and @xmath49 as its value at @xmath50 fm .",
    "furthermore , we include only charged particles within @xmath51 and transverse momentum range @xmath52 gev@xmath1 in evaluating the elliptic flow @xmath35 in order to compare more directly with the star data on the centrality dependence .    in fig .",
    "[ figb ] , we show the results for the elliptic flow of charged particles as a function of @xmath46 for the scenarios of the default ampt ( without string melting ) and the extended ampt ( with string melting ) .",
    "the error bars in our results represent only the statistical error in @xmath35 but not that in @xmath47 .",
    "although all results show the qualitative features of the observed centrality dependence of @xmath35 @xcite , the shape and magnitude of @xmath35 depend sensitively on the partonic dynamics @xcite . without converting the initial strings into partons ,",
    "the default ampt model gives the smallest elliptic flow .",
    "allowing the melting of strings to partons , the elliptic flow for a larger parton cross section not only is higher than that for a smaller partonic cross section , but also peaks at a lower value of @xmath46 . of the three parton cross sections , the results for @xmath40 mb appear to be more consistent with the observed centrality dependence of the elliptic flow .",
    "we note that the results from the default ampt model are insensitive to the parton scattering cross section , which is taken to be @xmath53 mb in the scenario with strings .",
    "this is mainly due to the small fraction of energy that is carried by minijet partons and the lack of transverse collective motion of the strings . as a result",
    ", the elliptic flow is significantly reduced after minijet partons combine with strings and fragment to hadrons . however , with strings converting to partons , the initial energy originally stored in the strings also contributes to the parton dynamics .",
    "this leads to a larger elliptic flow and its sensitivity to the parton cross section , and thus makes it possible to determine the strength of partonic interactions from the final elliptic flow .      our results for the dependence of charged particle elliptic flow on the transverse momentum , i.e.",
    ", the differential elliptic flow @xmath54 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ figpt ] . as observed in the experiment data , the differential elliptic flow first increases almost linearly with transverse momentum and then tends to level off at large transverse momenta .",
    "however , both the slope of initial increase and the transverse momentum at which deviation from a linear dependence appears are affected by the parton dynamics .",
    "the result from the default ampt model @xcite ( open triangles ) , which includes only minijets in the partonic phase , has the smallest @xmath54 at a given @xmath55 and shows a departure from the linear dependence also at the smallest transverse momentum . including partons from string melting in the high energy density regions increases both the magnitude of @xmath54 and the value of @xmath55 at which the linear dependence breaks down .    the differential elliptic flow @xmath54 is expected to be different for different particles @xcite .",
    "[ figm ] shows our results for pions , kaons and nucleons from the extended ampt model together with the star data for charged particles @xcite . at low transverse momentum ( @xmath56 gev@xmath1 ) , while the @xmath54 of pions and kaons increases almost linearly with @xmath55 , that of nucleons shows a stronger dependence on @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , particles with smaller masses are seen to have higher values of @xmath54 at a given @xmath55 .",
    "these features are qualitatively similar to those observed from the star data @xcite and also those obtained from the hydrodynamic models @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "all particles seem to have similar values of elliptic flow , within the errors of our calculations , at a given @xmath55 above @xmath57 gev/@xmath58 .    to test the sensitivity of our results to different formation time parameters",
    ", we have calculated the elliptic flow at @xmath33 fm for the following three cases for comparison : i ) parton formation time @xmath14 larger by a factor of 2 , ii ) @xmath14 smaller by a factor of 2 , iii ) hadron formation time @xmath59 set to 0.01 fm@xmath1 instead of the default 0.7 fm@xmath1 .",
    "compared to our default results , the relative changes of final charged particle @xmath35 are found to be less than 10% for @xmath60 gev@xmath1 .",
    "we have also studied the elliptic flow in au+au collisions at the maximum rhic energy of @xmath8 gev using the extended ampt model . in figs .",
    "[ fig_b200 ] and [ fig_pt200 ] , we show the dependence of the charged particle elliptic flow on impact parameter and transverse momentum , respectively , together with the results for @xmath40 mb at @xmath0 gev ( curves with filled diamonds ) .",
    "compared to fig .",
    "[ figb ] , it is seen that for the same parton cross section the elliptic flow in less central events ( @xmath62 ) increases only slightly ( no more than 0.01 in magnitude ) with the center - of - mass energy . as a result ,",
    "the sensitivity of the centrality dependence of elliptic flow to the parton scattering cross section in heavy ion collisions at @xmath61 gev is similar to that at @xmath0 gev .    for the differential elliptic flow ,",
    "[ fig_pt200 ] shows that for transverse momenta below about 1 gev@xmath1 , it shows even less change with the center - of - mass energy than the impact parameter dependence of the elliptic flow . as to the dependence on the parton cross section",
    ", the differential elliptic flow seems to show a larger sensitivity at higher transverse momenta .",
    "however , to study this quantitatively requires much better statistics than we have obtained so far .",
    "also , for elliptic flow at high @xmath55 , the effect of energy loss due to inelastic partonic processes , which have not been included in the ampt model , becomes important @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the parton coalescence model may be less suitable than the independent parton fragmentation model for modeling the hadronization dynamics .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions at rhic using a multiphase transport model that includes both partonic and hadronic scatterings . to take into account the effects of string melting due to initial high energy density ,",
    "we have introduced a schematic model to convert the strings produced in soft interactions into partons .",
    "we find that the magnitude of the elliptic flow is sensitive to the scattering cross sections of these partons . to reproduce the large elliptic flow observed in au+au collisions at @xmath43 gev at rhic requires a parton scattering cross section of roughly 6 mb .",
    "similar to the findings from hydrodynamic models , the differential elliptic flow @xmath54 for charged particles is found to increase almost linearly with @xmath55 at low transverse momentum . at high",
    "transverse momentum @xmath54 deviates from a linear dependence and becomes more flat . also , heavier particles have smaller @xmath54 than lighter particles at a given low @xmath55 , while they seem to have similar values of elliptic flow at higher @xmath55 .",
    "we further find that the increase of the elliptic flow from @xmath0 to @xmath8 gev is quite modest in the centrality dependence and is even less in the dependence on transverse momenta below 2 gev@xmath1 .",
    "in the present study , we have adopted a simple approach in converting strings to partons and in the hadronization from partons to hadrons . to treat this more consistently ,",
    "we need to consider the local parton and string densities and determine when strings are converted to partons and partons are combined to from hadrons . in a probably more systematic approach",
    ", the initial energy may be separated into two parts with the hard part corresponding to minijet gluons and quarks , and the soft part corresponding to color fields . a parton cascade including a color mean field",
    "can then be used to describe the subsequent dynamics .",
    "furthermore , both inelastic parton scatterings and particle subdivision @xcite have been neglected in the parton cascade .",
    "these may affect the elliptic flow and need to be studied in the future .",

    "<S> the elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions at rhic is studied in a multiphase transport model . by converting the strings in the high energy density regions into partons , we find that the final elliptic flow is sensitive to the parton scattering cross section . to reproduce the large elliptic flow observed in au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev requires a parton scattering cross section of about 6 mb . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the dependence of the elliptic flow on the particle multiplicity , transverse momentum , and particle mass .    </S>",
