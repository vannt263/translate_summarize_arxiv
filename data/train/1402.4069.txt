    "many techniques and algorithms have been proposed for digital image segmentation .",
    "traditional segmentation such as thresholding , histograms or other conventional operations are rigid methods .",
    "automation of these classical approximations is difficult due to the complexity in shape and variability within each individual object in the image .",
    "the mean shift is a non - parametric procedure that has demostrated to be an extremely versatile tool for feature analysis .",
    "it can provide reliable solutions for many computer vision tasks @xcite .",
    "mean shift method was proposed in 1975 by fukunaga and hostetler @xcite .",
    "it was largely forgotten until cheng s paper retook interest on it @xcite .",
    "segmentation by means of the mean shift method carries out as a first step a smoothing filter before segmentation is performed @xcite .",
    "entropy is an essential function in information theory and this has had a special uses for images data , e.g. , restoring images , detecting contours , segmenting images and many other applications @xcite .",
    "however , in the field of images the range of properties of this function could be increased if the images are defined in @xmath0 rings .",
    "the inclusion of the ring theory to the spatial analysis is achieved considering images as a matrix in which the elements belong to the cyclic ring @xmath0 . from this point of view , the images presents cyclical properties associated to gray level values .",
    "ring theory has been well - used in cryptography and many others computer vision tasks @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of ring theory to the spatial analysis of digital images , it is achieved considering the image like a matrix in which the elements belong to finite cyclic ring @xmath0 . the ring theory for the mean shift iterative algorithm",
    "was employed by defining images in a ring @xmath0 .",
    "a good performance of this algorithm was achieved .",
    "therefore , the use of the ring theory could be a good structure when one desires to compare images , due to that the digital images present cyclical properties associated with the pixel values .",
    "this property will allow to increase or to diminish the difference among pixels values , and will make possible to find the edges in the analyzed images .    in this paper , a new similarity index among images",
    "is defined , and some interesting properties based on this index are proposed .",
    "we compare also the instability of the iterative mean shift algorithm ( @xmath1 ) by using this new stopping criterion with regard to the stopping criterion used in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we make an extension of @xcite , and we expand the theoretical aspects by studying in depth the cyclical properties of rings applied to images . for this purpose , and in order to mark the difference of this paper with regard to @xcite , some issues are pointed out below :    * revision of the mean shift theory . *",

    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ theorical aspects ] , the more significant theoretical aspects of the mean shift and entropy are given .",
    "section [ similarity ] describes the similarity index , its consecuences for entropy function and the significance of the cyclic ring @xmath0 for images .",
    "also , it is defined the quotient space of strongly equivalent images and some properties of entropy are proved .",
    "the experimental results , comparisons and discussion are presented in section [ experiments ] .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] the conclusions are given .",
    "one of the most popular nonparametric density estimators is kernel density estimation .",
    "mathematically , the general multivariate kernel density estimate at the point @xmath3 , is defined by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 data points @xmath6 represent a population with some unknown density function @xmath7 .    in the case of images : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath10 kernel function with compact support satisfying the regularity constraints as described in @xcite , and @xmath11 is a symmetric positive definite bandwidth matrix .    for image segmentation ,",
    "the feature space is composed of two independent domains : the @xmath12 domain and the @xmath13 domain .",
    "we map a pixel to a multidimensional feature point which includes the @xmath14 dimensional spatial lattice ( @xmath15 for image ) and @xmath16 dimensional color ( @xmath17 for gray scale images and @xmath18 for color image and @xmath19 for multispectral image ) . due to the different natures of the domains ,",
    "the kernel is usually broken into the product of two different radially symmetric kernels ( subscript @xmath20 is refer to the spatial domain , and @xmath21 to the color range ) : @xmath22 where @xmath3 is a pixel , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the profiles used in the two respective domains , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are employed bandwidths in @xmath27 domains and @xmath28 is the normalization constant . using the equation ( [ imagen kernel defintion ] ) , the kernel density estimator is : @xmath29 as was shown in ( [ imagen kernel defintion ] ) and ( [ eq : imagen density estimation ] ) , there are two main parameters that have to be defined by the user : the spatial bandwidth @xmath25 and the range bandwidth @xmath26 .    the _ epanechnikov _ function is chosen as the kernel function in this work , this function is defined as :    @xmath30    the gradient of function @xmath7 is formulated as    @xmath31    @xmath32    where region @xmath33 is a hypersphere of radius @xmath34 having volume @xmath35 , centred at @xmath3 , and containing @xmath36 data points ; that is , the uniform kernel . by simplicity , in this paper",
    ", we only approach the case @xmath37 corresponding to gray level images , but could be extended in the same way to color ( @xmath38 ) and multispectral ( @xmath39 ) images .",
    "in addition , the last factor in expression ( [ label4 ] ) is called the sample mean shift    @xmath40    the quantity @xmath41 is the kernel density estimate @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 means the uniform kernel ) computed with the hyper sphere @xmath33 , and thus we can write the expression ( [ label4 ] ) as :    @xmath44    which yields , @xmath45    expression ( [ label7 ] ) shows that an estimate of the normalized gradient can be obtained by computing the sample mean shift in a uniform kernel centered on @xmath3 . in addition , the mean shift has the gradient direction of the density estimate at point @xmath3 .",
    "since the mean shift vector always points towards the direction of the maximum density increase , it can define a path leading to a local density maximum ; that is , toward the density mode .    a generalization to others kernels",
    "is achieved using _ profile _ definition and _ shadow kernel _ definition .",
    "moreover , a direct relationship settles down between the kernel used for mean shift vector @xmath46 and the one used for the probabiity density function @xcite .",
    "_ profile _ and _ shadow _ kernels are two suitable definitions to prove important and relevant properties for kernels and mean shift vector .    in @xcite",
    ", it was proved that the obtained _ mean shift procedure _ by the following steps , guarantees the convergence :    * computing the mean shift vector @xmath46 * translating the window @xmath47 by @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , if the individual mean shift procedure is guaranteed to converge , a recursively procedure of the mean shift also converges .",
    "other related works with this issue can be seen in @xcite .",
    "entropy is a measure of unpredictability or information content . in the space of the digital images",
    "the entropy is defined as :    the entropy of the image @xmath48 is defined by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the total quantity of bits of the digitized image @xmath48 and @xmath51 is the probability of occurrence of a gray - level value .    by agreement @xmath52 @xcite.within a totally uniform region",
    ", entropy reaches the minimum value . theoretically speaking , the probability of occurrence of the gray - level value , within a uniform region is always one . in practice ,",
    "when one works with real images the entropy value does not reach , in general , the zero value .",
    "this is due to the existent noise in the image .",
    "therefore , if we consider entropy as a measure of the disorder within a system , it could be used as a good stopping criterion for an iterative process , by using @xmath1 .",
    "more goodness on entropy applied to image segmentation algorithm can be seen in @xcite .",
    "in recent works @xcite , the entropy has been an important point in order to define a similarity index to compute the difference between two images .",
    "one of the most common criterion are shown in the next equation : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the function of entropy and the algorithm is stopped when @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 are respectively the threshold to stop the iterations and the number of iterations .",
    "two images @xmath48 and @xmath58 are weakly equivalents if @xmath59 .",
    "we denote the weak equivalence between @xmath48 and @xmath58 using @xmath60 .",
    "the similarity index in ( [ old criterion ] ) never consider the spatial information between the images @xmath48 and @xmath58 .",
    "for this reason , it is possible to have two very different images and to obtain a small value by using ( [ old criterion ] ) .",
    "this is a strong reason to consider that the similarity index ( [ old criterion ] ) is not appropriated to estimate the distance between two images .    taking into account the issues raised above ,",
    "it is necessary consider a new similarity index based on the following conditions :    1 .",
    "consider the use of the entropy function .",
    "take into account the spatial information between both images .",
    "the two following subsections have been dedicated to how face this problem by means of the employment of the ring theory .",
    "it is natural to think that two images are similar if their subtraction is close to zero .",
    "the problem of this idea is that , in general , when the subtraction gives negative values many authors consider to truncate to zero these elements .",
    "this consideration , in general , it not describe the difference between two images , and in some cases , it is possible to lose important information .",
    "for this reason , it is necessary to define a structure such that the operations between two images are intern .",
    "the @xmath0 ring is the partition of @xmath61 ( set of integer numbers ) in which the elements are related by the congruence module @xmath5 .",
    "mathematically speaking , we say that @xmath62 is in the class of @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) if @xmath62 is related by @xmath65 with @xmath63 , where @xmath66 consequently @xmath67 .",
    "we use the structure of the @xmath0 ring in the set of the images of size @xmath68 where the pixel values are intergers belonging to @xmath69 $ ] and we denote this set as @xmath70 . we obtain the next result .",
    "the set @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are respectively the pixel - by - pixel sum and multiplication in @xmath0 , has a ring structure .",
    "as the pixels of the image are in @xmath0 , they satisfy the ring axioms .",
    "the operation between two images was defined pixel by pixel , then it is trivial that @xmath70 under the operations @xmath74 of the @xmath0 ring inherits the ring structure .",
    "the following observations are important in order to understand the main features of the ring @xmath2 :    * the neutral element for the sum is the image with all pixels have zero value , it is denoted by @xmath75 .",
    "* note that the image with all pixel values are equal to one ( @xmath76 ) is the neutral element respect to the multiplication , ( observe that the multiplication between two images was defined element by element ) . *",
    "if @xmath77 then @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the additive inverse of @xmath48 in @xmath2 .    working with images with coefficients in @xmath0 , one has a better way to analyze images , and the cyclical effect opens a new way that largely reflects the resemblance of a gray level of a pixel with regarding its neighbors .    two images @xmath80 are strongly equivalents if @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a scalar image .",
    "we denote the strong equivalence between @xmath48 and @xmath58 as @xmath83 .",
    "note that if @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the additive inverse of @xmath82 in the ring .",
    "this is calculated using the inverse of each pixels of @xmath82 in @xmath0 .",
    "if two images @xmath48 and @xmath58 are strongly equivalents then they are weakly equivalents .    if @xmath48 and @xmath58 are strongly equivalents then @xmath87 where @xmath82 is a scalar image .",
    "but @xmath82 is a scalar image and for this reason the sum @xmath89 only change in @xmath58 the intensity of each pixel , but this does not change the number of different intensities or the frequency of each intensity in the image . then , @xmath90 .",
    "finally we obtain that @xmath59 and they are weakly equivalents .    note that the shown images in figure [ different images comparison ] are weakly equivalents , but they are not strongly equivalents .",
    "this is an example that @xmath91 . in general , it is important to understand that two images strongly equivalents have the same histogram of frecuency , except for one uniform traslation of all gray levels .",
    "consider the next example to see the importance of the ring theory in the operations among images .",
    "the image in figure [ histogram original image ] has a histogram of frecuency that is shown in figure [ histograma imagenen de ejemplo ] .",
    "if it is compute the addition and subtraction of the figure [ histogram original image ] by a scalar image @xmath82 ( where @xmath82 has all pixels equal to @xmath92 ) , using the ring theory are obtained the histograms of frecuency that are shown in figure [ frecuencia ring sum ] and figure [ frecuencia ring rest ] .",
    "+    note that the effect of this operations only changes the value of the pixels but do not changes the frecuency or the number of gray levels .",
    "in fact , graphically it is possible to see that the addition or subtraction in the ring only generates a shift in the frequency histogram , so , the images with the frecuency histogram in figure [ frecuencia ring sum ] and figure [ frecuencia ring rest ] , have the same properties and information that the original image in figure [ histogram original image ] . on the other hand , if we consider the classic addition and subtraction among images , it is easy to see in figure [ frecuencia normal sum ] and figure [ frecuencia normal rest ] that important information is lost due to the effect of truncation .",
    "in fact , this effect causes that high frequencies have been accumulated in @xmath93 in the addition case and in @xmath94 in the subtraction case ( see figures [ frecuencia normal sum ] and [ frecuencia normal rest ] ) .",
    "based on the above aspects , it is interesting to define the equivalence classes among images based on the concept of strong equivalence . this definition is necessary because the strong equivalent images has the same information , but from the point of view of intesity pixel , they do not have to be identically equal . in such sense , we will define the quotient group containing images in equivalent classes .",
    "given an image @xmath48 , we said that the image @xmath58 is in the class of @xmath48 if and only if @xmath48 and @xmath58 are strongly equivalents .",
    "we denote the equivalence class of @xmath48 as @xmath95 .",
    "it is natural to consider the definition of the similarity index using the quotient space of the images by using strong equivalent images , considering the given equivalence classes above .",
    "for this reason , it is necessary to proof that the quotient space exists .",
    "more precisely , as strong equivalent images have been defined by the addition operation , the quotient group will be built on this operation .",
    "the set @xmath96 is a normal ( or invariant ) subgroup of @xmath71 .",
    "first we will show that the set @xmath97 is a subgroup of @xmath2 .    1 .",
    "* addition operation is well - defined*. if @xmath98 , @xmath99 where @xmath100 are elements of @xmath82 and @xmath101 are elements of @xmath102 .",
    "then , @xmath103 and the image @xmath104 has all elements equals , so , @xmath105 .",
    "* neutral element*. the neutral element ( @xmath75 ) in the group is the image with all pixels equals to zero , defined at the previous subsection [ image via ring theory ] .",
    "* inverse element*. let @xmath106 , but @xmath107 has a inverse element @xmath108 in @xmath0 .",
    "considering the image @xmath109 with all elements equal to @xmath108 , we obtain that @xmath110 , then @xmath109 is the inverse of @xmath82 .",
    "we have proved that @xmath97 is a subgroup of @xmath71 , only remains to prove that @xmath97 is normal .",
    "for this purpose we use that @xmath97 is a normal subgroup of @xmath111 if @xmath112 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "let @xmath113 and @xmath114 , let us define @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "but , we know that @xmath0 is abelian , therefore @xmath71 is abelian too , so , @xmath117 .",
    "finally @xmath118 .    with the last result",
    ", it was proved that the quotient space is well - defined , and it will be denoted by @xmath119 .",
    "remember that the elements of this quotient space are the equivalence classes .",
    "now , it does not matter which element of the class is chosen to carry out the operation , since any of these images are a representative element of its respective equivalence class .",
    "let @xmath95 and @xmath120 be two elements in the quotient space @xmath119 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are images .",
    "the natural entropy distance ( ned ) between @xmath123 and @xmath124 is defined by @xmath125    the `` natural entropy distance '' have the following properties related with the axioms of distance :    1 .   * non - negativity * : @xmath126 .",
    "+ since entropy function is always positive , then @xmath127 2",
    ".   * identity of indiscernibles * : @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath129 3 .   * reflexivity * : @xmath130 .",
    "@xmath131    if it are considered the images of figure [ different images comparison ] , applying the natural entropy distance the result shows that : @xmath132 with this result , one can appreciate that have been differentiated images , including the spatial information too .",
    "the similarity index that was proposed in ( [ equation ned ] ) is very simple and computationally efficient .",
    "taking in consideration the good properties that , in general , the ned definition has , one sees logical to take this new similarity index as the new stopping criterion of @xmath1 .",
    "explicitly , the new stopping criterion is : @xmath133 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are respectively the threshold to stop the iterations and the number of iterations .    since @xmath1 is an iterative algorithm",
    ", we obtain a sequence that the processed image becames more homogenous as the algorithm advances .",
    "it is intuitive that comparing a resultant image @xmath134 at a given iteration with the previous image @xmath135 of the corresponding sequence , give us a measure about how much these images look like each other .",
    "the algorithm [ algoritmonew ] shows the general structure of the @xmath1 with ned as stopping criterion .",

    "initialize @xmath138 and @xmath139    the principal goal of this section is to evaluate the new stopping criterion in the @xmath1 and to illustrate that , in general , with this new stopping criterion the algorithm has better stability in the segmentation process . for this aim",
    ", we used three different images for the experiments , which have been chosen according to the differences among their respective levels of high and low frequencies .",
    "the first image (  bird \" ) has low frequencies , the second (  baboon \" ) has high frequencies and in the image (  montage \" ) has mixture low and high frequencies .",
    "all segmentation experiments were carried out by using a uniform kernel . in order to be effective the comparison between the old stopping criterion and the new stopping criterion",
    ", we use the same value of @xmath26 and @xmath25 in @xmath1 ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath25 is related to the spatial resolution of the analysis , while the value @xmath26 defines the range resolution . in the case of the new stopping criterion",
    ", we use the stopping threshold @xmath141 and when the old stopping criterion was used @xmath142 .    figure [ test images ]",
    "shows the segmentation of the three images .",

    "the new stopping criterion not only has good theoretical properties , but also , in the practice , has very good behavior .",
    "on the other hand , if we analyze the old stopping criterion in the experimental images ( figure [ iterations_old_bird ] , [ iterations_old_baboon ] , [ iterations_old_montage ] ) , one can see that the performance in the @xmath1 is unstable .",
