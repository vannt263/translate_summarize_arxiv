    "this expectation relies on the common association of quantum markovianity with a lindblad master equation(and vice versa ) . yet , the notion of what is a non - markovian open quantum dynamics has undergone a critical change in paradigm in the last few years thanks to the introduction of a number of quantum non - markovianity measures @xcite all based on quantum information concepts ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . according to most of these , a markovian dynamics",
    "does not necessarily imply a gkls master equation ( while the converse is true ) .",
    "a paradigmatic non - markovian dynamics is the well - known atomic emission into a lossy cavity in the strong coupling regime of cavity qed @xcite . in this regime the atomic population exhibits damped vacuum rabi oscillations leading to a quantum information back flow from the reservoir into the atom ",
    "namely a distinctive trait of non - markovian behavior @xcite . for such dynamics to occur an accurate engineering of the setup is required .",
    "in particular , in order to increase the atom - field coupling strength , it is necessary to confine the field mode within a small volume .",
    "a conceptually different way to create a cavity - qed - like dynamics was demonstrated by sapienza _",
    "_ in a seminal experiment @xcite , in which a quantum emitter was coupled to a _ disordered _ photonic cristal with no cavity or resonator engineering .",
    "the mechanism responsible for such a dynamics exploits the celebrated anderson localization @xcite , according to which transport is inhibited in a disordered medium due to the intrinsically localized nature of all normal modes ( _ localized modes _ ) . in this scenario a localized mode centered at the quantum emitter s site can indeed strongly couple to the emitter , much like a cavity mode does , giving rise to a cavity - qed - like dynamics .",
    "coherent polariton states have been indeed recently observed for a quantum dot coupled to a disordered photonic crystal @xcite .",
    "if such an analogy holds then static disorder , whose distinctive effect is anderson localization , should give rise to quantum non - markovianity of the emitter dynamics .",
    "the above intuition is the motivation of the present paper , whose aim is to investigate such disorder - induced quantum non - markovianity in terms of recently proposed quantum non - markovianity measures . as a case study",
    "we consider a quantum emitter ( atom ) _ weakly _ interacting with a coupled - cavity array ( cca ) . in the absence of disorder",
    "all the cca modes are delocalized over the entire lattice , and  as expected  the atom undergoes standard markovian spontaneous emission with the excitation propagating away from the atom location .",
    "we introduce static disorder in the above setup in the form of random detunings of the frequencies of the array cavities according to a probability distribution function ( pdf ) of given width .",
    "we show that the presence of disorder induces information back flow from the cca to the atom , as witnessed by a non - monotonic time evolution of the atomic population , due to the appearance of cca localized modes .",
    "we show that the _ average _ non - markovianity @xmath0 grows monotonically with the disorder width , suggesting a quantitative dependence of the non - markovianity degree on the degree of anderson localization . to interpret the functional form of this relationship",

    "we show that this model can reproduce fairly well the functional dependence of @xmath0 on the pdf width ( the latter being a measure of the disorder strength ) .",
    "the present work is organized as follows . in the section _ the model and the open dynamics _ , we define the system under investigation and the general features of the atom open dynamics . in section _ localization lenght and non - markovianity measures _ , we illustrate the definitions of localization length and non - markovianity measure that we adopt in out analysis . in section _ non - markovianity versus disorder strength _ , we quantitatively show how the presence of disorder induces quantum non - markovianity , deriving the functional dependance of the non - markovianity measure on the disorder strength . in section _ phenomenological model _ , we introduce a simple phenomenological model which allows us to provide a clear interpretation of the results of the previous section .",
    "we show how to determine the model parameters it depends on and use them to reproduce the behavior of the non - markovianity measure .",

    "such initial conditions , together with the conservation of the total number of excitations , @xmath20{\\!=\\!}0 $ ] , entail that the dynamics is restricted to the _ single - excitation _ sector of the entire hilbert space .",

    "i.e. , for @xmath51 , the free hamiltonian of the cca ( [ hf ] ) reduces to a standard ( uniform ) tight - binding model .",

    "our main goal is to study how this weak - coupling regime is affected by the introduction of disorder into the cca , in particular we will analize the non - markovianity induced by the disorder .",
    "here , we define the two main quantities that will play a central role in our analysis , namely the localization length and the non - markovianity measure .      localization is a well - known effect of static disorder in a one - dimensional lattice . in the setup considered in this paper",

    "it reads @xmath68 in this work we will quantify the localization length in terms of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "to quantify the amount of quantum non - markovianity of an open dynamics a number of theoretical measures have been put forward in the last few years @xcite .",
    "such measures have been used to identify the markovian and non - markovian behaviors regions in the parameters space of a variety of environmental models @xcite .",
    "these measures lead in general to non - equivalent partitions . however , the amplitude damping channel  which is the class of open dynamics involved in our case [ cf .",
    "( [ tlsmap ] ) ]  is a relatively simple one . in particular , for the amplitude damping channel , the non - markovianity measures introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , lead all to the same criterion for the occurrence of non - markovian behaviour : non - markovian behavior occurs if and only if the time derivative of @xmath71 [ cf .",
    "( [ psit ] ) and ( [ tlsmap ] ) ] is positive at some instant . in other words ,",
    "the dynamics is non - markovian iff the atomic excited - state population can grow at some time ( in contrast to the markovian case where it monotonically decreases with time ) . in particular , according to the measure in ref .",
    "@xcite , this increase of atomic excitation corresponds to the occurrence of information back flow from the reservoir to the open system .    throughout this work , mainly for its computation convenience , we will adopt the measure of ref .  @xcite .",
    "this is formulated in terms of the time changes of the volume of accessible states of the open system @xmath72 . as this volume can only decrease with time for a markovain dynamics ( in particular one governed by the gkls master equation ) , the amount of quantum non - markovianity is measured by @xcite @xmath73 where the integral is over the time domains in which @xmath72 increases . for a dynamical map of the form , @xmath74 is explicitly given by @xcite @xmath75 evidently , @xmath76 if and only if @xmath71 grows at some times .",

    "so defined could diverge if @xmath71 exhibits stationary oscillations , which happens , e.g.  , in the case of an atom undergoing vacuum rabi oscillations due to its strong coupling with a lossless cavity mode . to get around this drawback , which can occur in our setup",
    "since the atom can strongly couple to a localized mode , as we will show , we rescale the non - markovianity measure as @xmath78 where the denominator is the analogue of eq .",

    "@xmath71 undergoes undamped oscillations ( vacuum rabi oscillations ) in such a way that the numerator equals the denominator yielding @xmath80 .",
    "similar ways of rescaling non - markovianity measures to avoid divergences have been used in the literature @xcite .",
    "in this section we will link the average non - markovanity of our disordered model with the amount of disorder . from now on we will assume the detunings @xmath81 to be random variable distributed according with a pdf @xmath82 , independent of the cavity site @xmath13 . to explore how our results depend on specific probability distributions we will consider a gaussian distribution @xmath83 as well as a cauchy distribution @xmath84 both centered at @xmath57 ( corresponding to @xmath58 ) and defined as @xmath85 in order to be consistent in our comparison we constrain the cauchy distribution width @xmath86 to fulfil @xmath87 , meaning that the probability that @xmath88 is the same with either pdf .",

    "it is important to stress that since the @xmath60 are time independent random variable , each particular pattern of detunings leads to a different time dependance of the atomic spontaneous emission and therefore to a different amount of non - markovianity .",
    "we will therefore investigate how the _ average _ non - markovianity depends on the amount of disorder .",
    "to this end we numerically evaluate the average non - markovianity , for a given @xmath15 and disorder strength @xmath90 , by generating a set of detunings @xmath24 according to the chosen pdf of width @xmath90 and compute @xmath91 through eq .  .",

    "when disorder is present in the form of random cavity detunings , the cca exhibits anderson localization since all of its normal modes are localized . by using a rigorous non - markovianity measure , we showed that such photon localization induces a non - markovianity of the atom s emission .",
    "intuitively , this arises from light localization , which enables information back flow from the photonic reservoir to the emitter .",
    "we found that non - markovianity takes place for any finite disorder strength , no matter how small it is , in contrast to other environmental models where instead non - markovian behavior occurs only beyond a finite threshold .",
    "the ensemble - averaged non - markovianity measure @xmath0 grows with the disorder width @xmath90 until it saturates to a value corresponding to vacuum rabi oscillations since , for large disorder , the atom is coupled only to a single localized normal mode of the cca . in order to understand the functional dependance of @xmath0 versus @xmath90",
    ", we formulated a phenomenological effective model where the atom is coherently coupled to a single mode and weakly to a markovian bath .",
    "once the dependence of its parameters on the disorder strength @xmath90 are heuristically defined , this model was shown to predict the behaviour of the average non - markovianity of our original disordered system .",
    "we first observe that in the light of eqs .",

    "hence , the leftmost - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) equals -1 and thus @xmath155 which shows eq .",
    "( [ nv+1 ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the rescaled non - markovianity measure @xmath91 thus reduces to that of the non - rescaled measure @xmath156 .",
    "based on eq .",
    "( [ nmv ] ) , it is easy to see that this can be expressed as @xmath157 where @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) are the local maxima ( minima ) points of the time function @xmath160 ( volume of accessible states ) with @xmath42 in our case given by eq .",
