    "coherent bound states of a large number of bosonic quanta are known as  semiclassical solitons \" .",
    "an important subclass of them  _ topological solitons _  play a significant role in physics in general and in the dynamics of gauge theories in particular .",
    "electroweak sphalerons , for instance , were extensively studied in the context of baryon number violation in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "instantons drive the breaking of chiral @xmath5 and @xmath6 symmetries in qcd , while dyons / monopoles are believed to be related to the phenomenon of color confinement .",
    "the objects we will study in this paper belong to the less famous subclass , namely _  non - topological _ solitons \" , which have remained somehow in the shadow of their topological relatives , although also studied  as pure theoretical constructions  for a long time .",
    "they are localized field configurations with finite energy which owe their existence not to topological properties , but rather to the existence of a conserved charge .",
    "the first examples were studied by r. friedberg , t. d. lee and a. sirlin in @xcite and some time later coleman studied what he termed _",
    "q - balls _",
    "these solitons , as we shall discuss below , are built out of scalar fields with an unbroken @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "as is well known , derrick s theorem precludes the existence of time - independent soliton configurations in @xmath7 if only scalar fields are involved .",
    "however , non - topological solitons , both the friedberg _",
    "et al . _ and q - balls ,",
    "circumvent derrick s theorem by an explicit time dependence and owe their stability to the conserved charge associated to the unbroken @xmath5 . despite of this similarity",
    ", they differ in some other respects .",
    "for instance , in the case of the friedberg _",
    "_ type , there s a second symmetry which is spontaneously broken due to the presence of a higgs - like scalar field .",
    "they represent , as we shall see , regions of space in which the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is suppressed due to the presence of heavy particles . in this work",
    "we concentrate solely in this kind of higgs - based solitons and the role of quantum corrections as we believe they might be relevant in applications to cosmology , although we will often compare our results to those previously obtained for q - balls .",
    "regarding q - balls , it was first shown in @xcite that they exist in the limit of large charge @xmath8 , and it was later shown in @xcite that these classical q - balls actually exist all the way down to @xmath9 .",
    "these small q - balls may play an important role in cosmological applications kusenko:1997ad and therefore it is important to determine the validity of the classical approximation .",
    "therefore , the role of quantum corrections to these small q - balls was explored in @xcite by using the methods developed in @xcite and it was found that although they are small in comparison to the classical energy , they are comparable to the binding energy for small @xmath8 . it was finally concluded that quantum corrections ( for typical values of coupling constants ) render small q - balls ( @xmath10 ) unstable .",
    "in contrast to all these works , we do not discuss hypothetical objects which can only appear in various extensions beyond the standard model , but address the range of stability and existence of the multi - quanta higgs bags ( mqhb ) in the sm itself .",
    "we have in mind the heaviest objects of the sm , top quarks @xmath11 and @xmath12 bosons , to which we refer generically as  quanta \" .",
    "of course , bags with many top quarks , or @xmath13 as we will call them , are quite different from scalar - quanta bags due both to their fermionic nature and their coupling to the higgs field .",
    "however , these issues , and the potential role of these bags in the electroweak baryosynthesis problem , will be addressed elsewhere @xcite . in this work , which is mostly methodical in nature ,",
    "we first address the issue of whether quantum corrections can or can not destabilize these objects .",
    "the interest in the issue originated from the question whether a sufficiently heavy sm - type fermion should actually exist as a different state , in which it depletes the higgs vev around itself and thus is accompanied by its own  bag \" @xcite .",
    "although classically this seemed to be possible , it was shown by farhi _",
    "_ @xcite that in fact quantum ( one loop ) effects destabilize such bags , except at such a large coupling that the theory itself is apparently _ sick _ , with an instability of its ground state .",
    "the issue rest dormant for some time till nielsen and froggatt @xcite argued that although the yukawa coupling may still be small , there should be binding when the number of particles @xmath0 is such that @xmath14 indeed , a similar generic argument explains for example why gravity , although very weak , can create bound states  planets and stars  but only for an  astronomically large \" @xmath0 .",
    "these authors also suggested that 12 top+antitop quarks ( the  magic number \" corresponding to the maximal occupancy of the lowest @xmath15 orbital , 6 quarks and 6 anti - quarks with all spin and color values ) already form deeply bound states with near - zero total mass .",
    "here is when one of us ( es ) became involved : in a paper with kuchiev and flambaum @xcite we checked this suggestion and showed that , unfortunately , it is @xmath16 the case . while for a massless higgs we found a _ weakly _ bound state of 12 tops , for a realistic higgs mass there is no bound state at all .",
    "a possible direction to consider is that of introducing new hypothetical fermions with a stronger coupling ( larger masses ) than that of the top quark and the possibility of these forming _ baryons _ , well - bound by the higgs . this issue has been discussed further in the second paper of the same authors @xcite and we will discuss the implications of our study for this later .",
    "although we disagreed with the calculation by nielsen and froggatt @xcite on 12 tops , we think that further studies of multi - quanta higgs bags are well justified . in this paper , we will be especially interested in the case in which the number of  quanta \" @xmath0 is large enough to considerably modify the higgs vev compared to its vacuum value .",
    "in other words , we will focus on relativistic bound states , in which the  quanta \" inside the soliton have masses quite different from their vacuum ones , rather than non - relativistic atom - like bound states with smaller @xmath0 .",
    "this sector of the sm spectroscopy constitutes an interesting class of relativistic many - body systems , quite different from atoms and nuclei in many respects , especially regarding quantum corrections , which we study .",
    "while the experimental production of a large number of heavy quarks / bosons in a sufficiently small volume is clearly impossible , at the lhc or any other future proton accelerator , such states may play a significant role in cosmological baryogenesis at temperatures slightly below the electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "turning now to the main subject of this paper ; the role of _ quantum corrections _ to the energy of such configurations , we express their energy generically as a quantum loop diagram expansion @xmath17.\\ ] ] below we calculate the one - loop coefficient @xmath18 closely following both the specific model and the practical methods developed in @xcite . very specifically , the issue we investigated is the @xmath0-dependence of the 1-loop radiative correction .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec_classical ]",
    "we formulate the lagrangian and the thin wall \" approximation used to prove the existence of solitons at large enough @xmath0 . in section [ sec_quantum ] we review the methods developed in farhi:1998vx which provide a practical tool for numerically calculating the 1-loop radiative corrections to soliton configurations .",
    "it is important to note that these methods were designed for time - independent classical configurations while the non - topological configurations we just discussed have an explicit time dependence by having a non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite ( in an application to _ q_-balls ) the method can easily be adapted to study a time - dependent configuration as well . after an estimate of the effect of quantum corrections in section [ quantum estimate ] and a discussion of other secondary calculational details in section [ sec_calc ] ,",
    "we proceed to our results in section sec_results .",
    "consider the action @xmath19where @xmath20 is a real scalar field , modeling the sm higgs , with its vev @xmath21 .",
    "a complex scalar field @xmath22 would have  quanta \" , our simple version of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this system was studied in friedberg:1976me as an example which exhibits a soliton solution at the classical level . in this section",
    "we review the general arguments which were given in favor of the existence of these objects .    due to the global symmetry @xmath25 in ( action ) , there s an associated conserved current , @xmath26 with @xmath27and a corresponding conserved particle number @xmath28    now , let the complex scalar be a time - dependent field rotating in internal space with a frequency @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30    the classical energy @xmath31 from ( [ action ] ) reads ,    @xmath32\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    and from ( [ number operator ] ) we have @xmath33the equations of motion read @xmath34by using the equation of motion ( [ eom for psi ] ) for @xmath22 in ( energy ) and the expression ( [ charge ] ) we find    @xmath35    with    @xmath36 ,   \\label{higgs energy}\\ ] ]    where we have defined as usual @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the classic configuration consists of a static background field @xmath38 and @xmath0  quanta \" of the @xmath39 field at an energy level @xmath40 . in the higgs vacuum , @xmath41 , @xmath0 quanta of the @xmath39 field",
    "would be forced to rest at the bottom of the continuum spectrum and the total energy of the system would simply be @xmath42",
    ". however , in the background of a non - trivial higgs field there are two competing effects . on the one hand , the gradient and potential terms in ( [ higgs energy ] ) increase the energy but , on the other hand , there might be some bound states levels with energy @xmath43 which can allocate the quanta , lowering the energy of the system of particles at the expense of creating such a higgs configuration .",
    "in particular , if there s a large region of nearly - zero higgs vev ( where particles would be nearly massless ) , a soliton will be possible if the energy increase by creating such a region is offset by the energy decrease of @xmath0 particles giving away their mass .",
    "indeed , the existence of such solitons was shown in @xcite by considering the following trial configuration : a time - independent higgs field which vanishes inside a sphere of radius @xmath44 while outside it takes its asymptotic value , with a transition region of size @xmath45 .",
    "the complex scalar @xmath46 is non - zero inside the sphere and vanishes outside . in a _ thin - wall _ approximation , @xmath47 this provides a spherical well in which the complex field forms a relativistic bound state , i.e. @xmath48with @xmath49 . from",
    "( [ classical energy ] ) , ( [ higgs energy ] ) the energy of such a configuration , in the limit of large @xmath44 , reads@xmath50which has a minimum at @xmath51where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "notice the power of @xmath0 with which the energy scales . if the higgs field took its asymptotic value everywhere @xmath54i.e .",
    "@xmath55 , the total energy of the system would simply be given by @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath57 for large @xmath0 , there s always a large enough @xmath0 which makes the soliton configuration energetically favored over simply having @xmath0 particles in the higgs vacuum .",
    "notice that the critical configuration with @xmath58 is given by@xmath59since @xmath44 grows with @xmath0 , this expression becomes more accurate for large @xmath0 , i.e. when @xmath60 expression ( [ critical bag ] ) gives the limiting value for @xmath61 .",
    "it was similarly shown in @xcite that in the limit @xmath62 , an upper bound on @xmath63 is given by@xmath64and therefore when the higgs becomes massless the solitons exist not only for large enough @xmath0 but actually all the way down to small @xmath0 .",
    "recall that derrick s theorem precludes the existence of _",
    "time- independent _ solitons with an action such as ( [ action ] ) , but this no - go theorem is clearly circumvented here because of the explicit time dependence in ( [ solution ] ) , which leads to @xmath65 .",
    "if we had no time dependence the first term in ( [ energy classical soliton ] ) would vanish , rendering the system s minimum at @xmath66 , in accordance with derrick s theorem .",
    "although we have shown the existence of classical bags in certain approximations , in order to explicitly find such configurations with minimal energy we adopted a variational strategy .",
    "we first fix a smooth , 1-parameter , bag - shaped , background higgs field ansatz on which we numerically solve the equation of motion for @xmath22 .",
    "we then minimize the resulting energy with respect to the variational parameter .",
    "once the classical solution is found we turn to the study of quantum corrections by implementing the method developed in @xcite , which for completeness is reviewed in the next section .",
    "as we have seen , a non - trivial higgs background may create classical bag - like solitons .",
    "however , it also has a secondary effect at the quantum level , which is that of disrupting the energy levels of the vacuum by the cassimir effect . to study whether this affects or not the existence of solitons we must study the vacuum energy , given to leading order in @xmath67 , by the effective action .",
    "the calculation of such an object will be plagued by the usual divergences of field theory and requires proper renormalization . in this section",
    "we review the method developed by farhi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which precisely provides us a way of calculating the effective action in a manner consistent with on - shell mass and coupling renormalization .",
    "we shall consider the effective action induced only by integrating out fluctuations in @xmath22 .",
    "the one - loop effective action , induced by integrating out the @xmath39 field , is given by @xmath68}=e^{is_{\\phi } } \\frac{\\int d\\psi ^{\\ast } d\\psi e^{is_{\\psi } } } { \\int d\\psi ^{\\ast } d\\psi e^{\\left .",
    "is_{\\psi } \\right\\vert _ { v=0}}}\\]]and the effective energy is then @xmath69where @xmath70 is the quadratic operator @xmath71 , generally of the form @xmath72 .",
    "the matrix identity @xmath73 allows us to write the effective action as a trace in functional space .",
    "we can perform this trace over a complete set of functions satisfying @xmath74 or@xmath75which in the free ( @xmath76 ) case are simply plane waves @xmath77 . therefore , in that case , @xmath78 which by standard methods can be brought into the form @xmath79 , which is the usual vacuum energy . in the presence of a background potential",
    "there might be , in addition to the continuum , some discrete levels corresponding to scattering bound states . in such case",
    "the vacuum energy generally reads    @xmath80    where @xmath81 labels the discrete ( @xmath82 ) eigenvalues , if any , and continuous ( @xmath83 ) eigenvalues and @xmath84 are the energies of the excitations .",
    "this is simply the sum of zero - point fluctuations @xmath85 where the @xmath86 factor is absent due to @xmath39 being a complex field .",
    "therefore , there are 3 contributions to the total effective energy given by@xmath87=e_{cl}[h]+e_{ct}[h]+e_{vac.}^{_{\\psi } } [ h],\\]]where @xmath88 is the necessary renormalization energy counterterm . for a fixed @xmath89 ,",
    "the spectrum consists of a continuous spectrum @xmath90 and ( possibly ) a finite number of bound states with energy @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath91=\\sumint_{\\alpha } e_{\\alpha } = \\sum_{j}e_{j}+\\sum_{l}(2l+1)\\int dk\\rho _ { l}(k)e(k)\\]]where @xmath92 is the density of states in momentum space and the @xmath93 factor accounts for the degeneracy in the angular momentum projection . it can be shown that and a potential @xmath94 with finite range .",
    "asymptotically , the eigenfunctions will be given by trigonometric functions with argument @xmath95 .",

    "this represents an expansion in number of insertions of the potential @xmath102 and in this model only diagrams with 1 and 2 insertions are divergent .",

    "notice that after the boundary term due to levinson s theorem is included , the quantum correction due to the bound states is negative and therefore it lowers the total energy .",
    "this raises the possibility that one might find quantum solitons which classically are forbidden due to derrick s theorem .",
    "the existence of such solitons was explored in @xcite with no success . from the previous discussions , however , we know that classical , time - dependent",
    ", soliton configurations exist for @xmath115 and we are interested in determining the effect of quantum corrections to these classical configurations .",
    "we saw above that the method developed in @xcite deals specifically with time - independent classical configurations .",
    "therefore , to find the role of quantum corrections to the class of non - topological solitons we are interested in , we must adjust the methods to a time - dependent configuration .",
    "this has already been done in the case of @xmath8-balls in @xcite by one of the same authors who developed the methods for the static case . in our case",
    "the same reasoning applies and we closely follow the same derivation .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall discuss , in applying this method to the case at hand there s an important difference with respect to q - balls .",
    "the extension to the time - dependent case is easily carried out by studying fluctuations in a corotating frame .",
    "let @xmath116with @xmath117 the classical soliton discussed above and @xmath118 an arbitrary quantum fluctuation .",
    "then the classical action reads @xmath119 \\end{gathered}\\]]and to second oder in quantum fluctuations of @xmath39 @xmath120 .\\end{gathered}\\]]therefore , @xmath121is the quadratic operator of quantum fluctuations . for convenience",
    ", we parametrize @xmath122 , so that fluctuations over the _ static _",

    "now , since the spectrum in ( [ eigenvalue problem ] ) is symmetric in @xmath130 , we can write@xmath91=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{e_{\\alpha } > 0}\\left\\vert e_{\\alpha } -\\omega \\right\\vert + \\left\\vert e_{\\alpha } + \\omega \\right\\vert = \\sum_{e_{\\alpha } > 0}\\max \\{e_{\\alpha } , \\omega \\}.\\]]as we shall see below ,  if we only integrate out the fluctuations @xmath131 from ( [ action ] ) we have @xmath132 and therefore the vacuum energy is again simply @xmath91=\\sumint_{\\alpha } \\left\\vert e_{\\alpha } \\right\\vert   \\label{quantum energy 2}\\]]and the total energy reads    @xmath133    with @xmath31 given by ( [ classical energy ] ) . to see that we have @xmath132 in this case , we note that from the equations of motion we find @xmath134 in the @xmath135 @xmath136 channel , which is the most tightly bound state and therefore the lowest positive energy is @xmath137 , proving our assertion .",
    "it is important to note however that had we also considered fluctuations of the higgs field as well , there would be a zero mode of the quadratic operator @xmath70 ( which would be @xmath138 ) now in the @xmath139 channel , corresponding to translations of the soliton .",
    "this would imply that there s an energy level @xmath140 below @xmath29 ( in the @xmath141 channel ) , giving an additional contribution to the effective energy , namely @xmath142 , with respect to ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "this is important in the case of the @xmath8-ball where one has no other choice than considering such a zero mode as there s only one field involved and actually this term dominates the whole quantum correction graham:2001hr .",

    "the stability of these solitons and is ultimately the responsible for rendering q - balls with @xmath144 , unstable .",
    "however , as just discussed , that s not the case here due to the absence of the translational zero mode in the path integration .",
    "before going to the numerical calculations , we can illustrate the effects of quantum corrections on the solitons described in section [ sec_classical ] by using the thin - wall construction .",
    "this configuration corresponds to a spherical potential well of depth @xmath145 and size @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath146 , and the evaluation of the quantum corrections requires solving the energy levels of such a system .",
    "we wish to find the dependence of these energy levels on the size of the soliton .",
    "we can easily do this for the continuum energy relative to the higgs vacuum .",

    "however , the @xmath44-dependence is given by @xmath149and therefore it grows as the volume of the soliton and its effect is that of modifying the coefficient of @xmath150 in the classical energy ( [ thin wall energy ] ) .",
    "the precise dependence of the bound states contribution is harder to find analytically and will depend strongly on the coupling @xmath151 , as this determines the depth of the potential @xmath152 .",
    "nevertheless , we can understand its main effect .",
    "we know that a spherical well of depth @xmath153 has a minimum size @xmath154 at which the first bound state appears . for large",
    "coupling our potential becomes deeper and a large number of states could is bound .",
    "as is well known , in the case of an infinite spherical well there are an infinite number of bound states given by the spherical bessel functions @xmath155 .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath156 determines therefore the energy levels of a relativistic particle to be @xmath157where @xmath158 represents the @xmath159th zero of the @xmath45th order bessel function .",
    "the number @xmath160 of bound states in a _",

    "for relatively small values of @xmath151 ( @xmath162 ) this term has the finite effect of lowering the number @xmath63 of particles required to have a stable configuration .",
    "quantum corrections require some operations with the background higgs field ( such as finding its fourier transform ) which is difficult in practice to do for numerically generated shapes .",
    "therefore we adopted a variational approach , in which the field is given in a simple analytic form , with certain parameters to be determined from energy minimization .",
    "our purpose is to find a variational minimum of ( [ variational energy ] ) . for this we used a family of 1-parameter gaussian backgrounds for the higgs@xmath163where",
