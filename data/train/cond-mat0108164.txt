    "quantum transport properties of mesoscopic conductors coupled to two superconducting ( s ) leads have been extensively investigated in the last decade both theoretically and experimentally@xcite . the mesoscopic conductor in question is usually not a superconductor itself , but it can be a quantum point contact ( qpc)@xcite , a quantum dot ( qd)@xcite , a tunnel barrier , a normal metal@xcite , and even a molecule such as a nanotube@xcite . the physics of these hybrid device structures , in the form of s - normal - s , has profound implications to both fundamental understanding of quantum transport at reduced dimensionality and to practical applications in nanoelectronics .",
    "one of the main transport characteristics of a s - normal - s device structure is that particles in the normal region can undergo multiple andreev reflections by the two superconducting leads .",
    "if the normal region is ballistic , a consequence of the coherent superposition of these multiple andreev reflections is the formation of andreev bound states@xcite .",
    "the andreev bound states are important because they carry current including the supercurrent . on the other hand ,",
    "if the normal region is diffusive , a so - called supercurrent - carrying density of states , instead of the andreev bound states , gives the ability for carrying supercurrent@xcite .",
    "the multiple andreev reflection is also known to generate subharmonic gap structure in the behavior of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the average current and @xmath3 is the bias voltage@xcite .",
    "more recently , the subharmonic gap structure is used to measure transmission probability of each channel in a multi - channel qpc device@xcite .",
    "another important and interesting transport characteristic of s - normal - s devices is the josephson effect which gives rise to a dc supercurrent at zero bias , and an ac current at non - zero bias .",
    "previous theoretical analysis have focused on the dc josephson effect at zero bias@xcite , and the subharmonic gap structure of the _ average _ current at a non - zero bias@xcite .",
    "however , the ac josephson effect , which arises at a non - zero bias , produces a current that is a function of time @xmath4 .",
    "therefore it is an important task to theoretically understand the time dependent current in addition to understanding its time - average . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "so far there have been only two works which involve a time - dependent current@xcite for s - normal - s devices .",
    "cuevas _ et . al .",
    "_ have investigated the ac component of the time - dependent current for a s - qpc - s system@xcite .",
    "bratus _ et .",
    "al._@xcite have investigated the time - dependent current in a s - quantum - constriction - s system by considering an arbitrary normal electron transparency and discussing the current property at the small bias limit . in both these works , the normal region of the s - normal - s device",
    "was simplified so as not to have any electronic structure : it is simply described by a constant transmission coefficient which is independent of energy @xmath5 . given the interesting physics already discovered by these previous investigations , it is indeed not difficult to expect that even richer physics would arise if the normal region has its own electronic structure .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to further investigate the ac josephson effect in s - normal - s device systems , and we focus on issues not resolved by the previous analysis .",
    "in particular , we consider a mesoscopic s - normal - s device with an arbitrary normal region which may have its own electronic structure and/or strong electron - electron interactions : for this general situation we have derived the expression of the ac current . as an application",
    "we then investigate a specific case in which the normal region is a ballistic quantum dot having a noninteracting single energy level , for which we investigate the intradot nonequilibrium distribution of electrons , the local density of state ( ldos ) , and the time - dependent current .",
    "our main findings are : ( i ) the intradot electronic distribution shows a population inversion property .",
    "this property is distinctly and qualitatively different from that of the case where the normal region is diffusive .",
    "( ii ) at small bias voltages such that @xmath6 where @xmath0 is the superconducting gap , a series of andreev quasi - bound states is found to emerge within the gap .",
    "their weights are not the same but they carry equal amount of current in the same direction , as well , their electronic occupations are all 1/2 .",
    "this is qualitatively different from that of the zero bias case in which the successive andreev bound states carry opposite current .",
    "( iii ) the ac current component versus bias @xmath3 shows an oscillatory behavior .",
    "the amplitude of oscillation of the @xmath7th component is largest at about @xmath8 . at small bias",
    ", the high - order components quickly increase , and the time - dependent current versus time @xmath4 deviates from a sine - like curve .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "iii , ac josephson effect for a simple s - normal - s device with a noninteracting normal region is investigated .",

    "\\label{fd}\\ ] ] it is important to emphasize that the distribution of electrons can be experimentally measured@xcite . for example , recently pierre _ et .",
    "_ have measured@xcite this distribution for a s - normal - s device where the normal region is a diffusive mesoscopic metallic wire .",
    "they reported a multiple step structure for the distribution of electrons in that device@xcite .",
    "fig.2 shows the average intradot distribution of electrons at different bias voltage @xmath3 for our system with a very large coupling @xmath144 .",
    "when @xmath144 is large , coupling between the superconducting leads and the normal region is strong , therefore the device behaves like a s - ballistic - normal - conductor - s system .",
    "the property of the electron distribution in this situation is the following . when @xmath145 , the distribution is a constant , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath146 for symmetric couplings .",
    "when @xmath5 goes away from this region , the distribution quickly rises ( or drops ) to unity ( or to zero ) for @xmath147 ( or for @xmath148 ) ) .    to contrast with the experimental results of pierre",
    "al._@xcite , here the distribution is a constant instead of the multiple step structure between the gap , even though multiple andreev reflections do occur in our system .",
    "this difference originates from the different property of the central device region , _",
    "i.e. _ , our normal region is ballistic while that in pierre _ et .",
    "_ experiment is diffusive@xcite . in order to explain it in more detail",
    ", the inset of fig.2 shows a particular multiple ( two ) andreev reflection process . to start ,",
    "an incident electron at @xmath149 below the gap of the left lead tunnels into the qd , it passes two andreev reflections ( through the points labelled as a1-a6 ) inside the qd and finally tunnels into the right lead ( at @xmath150 ) which is higher than the gap of the right lead .",
    "due to the ballistic nature of the qd , the distribution of electrons at point a1 is the same as at a2 , the distribution of holes at a3 is the same as at a4 , while distribution of electrons at a5 is the same as at a6 .",
    "when @xmath144 is large , the probability of andreev reflection inside the qd within the energy gap is very close to unity@xcite , and hence the hole distribution at a3 is , to a very good extent , the same as the distribution of electrons at a2 .",
    "similarly the hole distribution at a4 is approximately the same as the electron distribution at a5 .",
    "we hence conclude that for the ballistic normal region , the distribution of particles ( electrons and holes ) along this path is the same everywhere , except at the abrupt change during the tunneling process at @xmath149 and @xmath150 from and to the two leads . moreover ,",
    "for symmetric barriers , the distribution of particles along the a1-a6 path must be @xmath151 .",
    "this explains why we obtained a constant @xmath151 distribution at @xmath152 as shown in fig.2 .",
    "this also explains why we expect a different distribution when the normal region is diffusive : for a diffusive conductor the distribution at a1 and a2 must be different due to diffusive scattering between the two points , therefore the distribution of particles will continuously vary from one to zero along the path a1-a6 .",
    "next , we investigate the distribution of electrons for @xmath153 , the results are shown in fig.3 . for this case ,",
    "a most prominent behavior of @xmath154 is that it oscillates as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the oscillations also become more rapid when bias voltage @xmath3 is reduced .",
    "an oscillatory @xmath154 means its value is not necessarily smaller for larger @xmath5 , hence a `` population inversion '' is possible .",
    "this population inversion originates from the non - monotonic probability of andreev reflections .",
    "for example , @xmath154 has a dip at @xmath155 , due to the following reason . for an incident electron coming from the left lead with energy @xmath156",
    ", this electron has a small but nonzero probability to pass the left barrier .",
    "after tunneling through , it reaches the right barrier where an andreev reflection occurs .",
    "because this electron has energy @xmath155 , the andreev reflection occurs with probability one@xcite .",
    "therefore the distribution of electrons at this energy @xmath5 is very small .",
    "when @xmath5 deviates from @xmath156 , the probability of andreev reflection decreases leading to a larger @xmath157 , hence we expect a dip in @xmath157 to emerge at @xmath155 .      in this subsection",
    ", we investigate another important quantity , the ldos .",
    "we will mainly discusses andreev bound states at a finite bias @xmath3 . if bias @xmath158 , multiple andreev reflections are very weak hence no andreev bound states can form in the qd . in this case",
    "the intradot level @xmath128 is only slightly shifted due to a non - zero real part of the self - energy @xmath159 , the level half - width is still on the scale of @xmath160 , and an extra structures ( a dip and a peak ) emerge in the curves of @xmath142 versus @xmath5 at the superconducting gap ( not shown in here ) .",
    "much more interesting is the case of @xmath161 , shown in fig.4 at different bias @xmath3 .",
    "a series of very narrow peaks emerge in @xmath142 , clearly indicate the formation of andreev bound states inside the qd .",
    "note that they are not rigorous bound states but are quasi - bound states with a finite life time , and after many andreev reflections the particle can leave the qd .",
    "this is different from the zero bias situation@xcite .",
    "the half - width of andreev bound states is much narrower than @xmath144 . with a decreasing bias @xmath3 ,",
    "they become even narrower with a higher intensity .",
    "the average distance between two successive andreev bound states is about @xmath162 .",
    "when @xmath163 and @xmath164 ( @xmath165 , ... ) are within the gap , there exists an andreev bound state between @xmath166 and @xmath164 .",
    "moreover , these andreev bound states are symmetrically distributed at the two side of @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "this means the following : when an incident electron from below the gap aligns perfectly with an andreev bound state of the qd , even after many andreev reflections it will always stay on the andreev bound state until it leaves the qd ( see inset of fig.4(a ) ) .",
    "along this path , the particle goes through all andreev bound states , and a resonance multiple andreev reflection occurs . occasionally , a quenching of andreev bound state is observed to occur . in this case , a specific andreev bound state may have very low ldos at a specific bias @xmath3 , an example is indicated by the arrow in fig.4(b ) .",
    "the results of fig.4 is obtained by fixing the intradot level @xmath128 to zero ( _ i.e. _ at the center of the gap ) .",
    "next , we investigate how are andreev bound states affected when @xmath169 , the results shown in fig.5 . with @xmath169 , the andreev bound states are shifted in their positions , but their physical characteristics are the same as those of @xmath170 .",
    "the amount of shift is not @xmath128 but much smaller and two successive andreev bound states are shifted in opposite directions .",
    "if an andreev bound state is in the energy range from @xmath166 to @xmath164 , it stays in this range at any value of @xmath128 .",
    "their heights vary with @xmath128 , when @xmath128 is in the range of @xmath163 to @xmath164 , the peak in this range reaches a maximum value .",
    "an important property of the andreev bound states is their ability to carry current . from eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) , the time - averaged current density @xmath171 is obtained to be : @xmath172 \\gamma_l \\hat{\\tilde{\\sigma}}_l \\hat{\\sigma}_z \\right\\}\\ .\\ ] ] the current density is related to time - averaged current as @xmath173 . in fig.6 ,",
    "we show intradot distribution of electrons @xmath157 ( solid curve in fig.6a ) , ldos ( dotted curve in fig.6a ) , and the time - averaged current density ( fig.6b ) @xmath171 .",
    "several observations are in order .",
    "although @xmath154 is oscillating between @xmath174 and @xmath175 in a complicated manner , its value at each andreev bound state ( the peak positions of the dotted curve ) is alway @xmath151 .",
    "this is because resonant multiple andreev reflections occur along the path of andreev bound states ( as shown in the inset of fig.4(a ) ) .",
    "the current density @xmath171 is dominated by a series of peaks located precisely at the energies of andreev bound states .",
    "this is a clear indication that current is carried by andreev bound states .",
    "when @xmath176 , the peaks of @xmath171 all have the same height : this means each andreev bound state carries exactly the same amount of current in the same flow direction .",
    "the reason for this peculiar behavior is simple . along the path of andreev bound states ( inset of fig.4(a ) ) ,",
    "all the electrons move in one direction while all the holes move in opposite direction , and along any one path the particle current must be same everywhere .",
    "therefore the andreev bound states carry same amount of current in the same direction .",
    "this property is qualitatively different from that of the zero bias case@xcite , in which the successive andreev bound states carry current with opposite sign .",
    "the time - averaged current @xmath2 of s - normal - s systems has been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "a main characteristic of the i - v curve @xmath177 is its subharmonic gap structure at @xmath178@xcite , our results are shown in fig.7",
    ". the i - v curves also exhibit subharmonic gap structure with a concomitant appearance of negative differential conductance .",
    "these results are in agreement with those reported recently by yeyati _ et . al._@xcite and johansson _ et .",
    "al._@xcite . in the following , we focus on the ac component of the current .    from eqs.(13 ) and",
    "( 16 ) , we decompose the time - dependent current into its dissipative contribution @xmath179 , and nondissipative contribution @xmath180@xcite , @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "fig.8 and fig.9 show the first and second ac components of @xmath184 and @xmath185 as a function of bias @xmath3 , and they are marked by a strong oscillatory behavior .",
    "the period of oscillations is roughly given by @xmath186 , which is dependent on bias @xmath3 . generally , for @xmath187 ( m=1,2 , ...",
    ") , we found that the ac components oscillate from a maximum to a minimum or vise versa .",
    "when @xmath188 , the components @xmath184 and @xmath185 quickly decay to zero .",
    "when @xmath189 , the amplitudes of the oscillations reach maximum . at @xmath190 , @xmath184 decays to zero while @xmath185 keeps a finite value .",
    "these behaviors are different from those devices whose normal region has no electronic structure .",
    "for instance , the result of s - qpc - s system shows no oscillation@xcite .",
    "the time - dependent current @xmath47 is shown in fig.10 .",
    "@xmath47 is a well known oscillatory function of time @xmath4 with a frequency @xmath67 .",
    "when bias @xmath3 is large , @xmath191 , the high - order fourier components have negligible contribution and @xmath47 can be approximated by @xmath192 .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath3 is small , high - order components contribution substantially and @xmath47 deviates from a simple sine - like curve .",
    "in this work , we have derived a general formula for ac components of the time - dependent current of arbitrary ballistic s - normal - s systems where the normal region has its own electronic structure . the formula ( eq.(17 ) ) is valid even when there is a strong interaction in the normal region of the hybrid device .",
    "we then applied this result to study ac josephson current for a system with the normal region being a noninteracting single level quantum dot .",
    "the average intradot distribution of electrons , the average intradot density of states , and ac components of the time - dependent current are investigated in detail .",
    "the distribution exhibits an interesting population inversion , a result that is qualitatively different from that of the diffusive normal region . a series of andreev bound states are formed at bias @xmath161 in our system .",
    "the peak heights of ldos for these andreev bound states are not the same , but each state carries the same amount of current . the distribution of electrons at the andreev bound states are all the same , _",
    "e.g. _ equals 1/2 for symmetric tunnel barriers . in general , the ac components of the time - dependent current has an oscillatory behavior against bias .",
    "depending on the value of bias , the high - order ac components may or may not contribute to the total time - dependent current , leading to a non - sine - like or a sine - like dependence on time for the total current .",
    "finally , we comment on the @xmath190 limit for the s - qd - s system of this work . while our general current formula , eq.(17 ) , is valid for any bias , how to correctly include important physical factors in an actual computation of the various quantities of eq.(17 ) , needs to be discussed .",
    "when bias is very small , @xmath193 , an incident electron from below the gap of the left superconducting lead undergoes many andreev reflections in the qd so as to go above the gap of the right superconducting lead before exiting the qd .",
    "therefore the dwell time @xmath194 of the particle in the qd becomes long . at the limit @xmath190",
    ", @xmath194 tends to large values .",
    "when @xmath194 is larger than the mean inelastic scattering time , the intradot relaxation effect should be considered in calculating the green s functions involved in eq.(17 ) .",
    "when there is no electronic structure in the normal region of the device , for instance in a s - qpc - s system@xcite , the @xmath190 limit has a variety of different regimes depending on an inelastic scattering rate parameter @xmath195 and a transmission probability of the qpc@xcite . for our s - qd - s system , while relaxation in the leads can similarly be included by introducing the same parameter @xmath195 into the green s function of the leads@xcite , this simple phenomenological approach can not be applied in the normal qd region . this is because distribution of leads is determined by their chemical potential , however the distribution in the qd must be calculated self - consistently for our system .",
    "indeed , if one introduces a finite @xmath195 in the qd green s function , current conservation will be violated .",
    "a proper treatment of this problem is , perhaps , to explicitly introduce an electron - phonon interaction term in the hamiltonian .",
    "this is a very complicated problem to solve and we hope to be able to report such an analysis in the future .",
