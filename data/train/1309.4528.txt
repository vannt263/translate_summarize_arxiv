    "<S> , the near threshold behavior has been studied by the various methods @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , the extensive experimental studies also indicate a diversity of the threshold or cusp effects . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the new experimental measurements of the charged @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite also show the _ absence _ of the enhancements near the thresholds of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> these new phenomena stimulate us to propose a new approach to describe the behavior near the threshold . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we proposed a new mechanism , which is named as the initial - single - pion - emission ( ispe ) mechanism to reproduce the lineshapes of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 invariant mass distributions , where the @xmath25 and @xmath26 were discovered .    in 2011 , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite by studying the hidden - charm dipion decays of higher charmonia and charmoniumlike states , where the ispe mechanism was adopted @xcite.this mechanism is described such that associating an initially emitted one chiral particle , @xmath27 in this case , enhancement in the invariant mass of @xmath28 can be seen through the triangle diagram with charmonia and charmoniumlike states @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the initial and final states . </S>",
    "<S> two years later , the besiii collaboration reported a charged charmoniumlike structure @xmath31 in @xmath32 at @xmath33 gev @xcite , which was confirmed by the belle collaboration @xcite and in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite later . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of @xmath31 confirms our prediction of a charged charmoniumlike structure near the @xmath3 threshold existing in the @xmath34 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath35 @xcite , which provides a crucial test of the ispe mechanism . with enough experimental data </S>",
    "<S> , we have succeded in reproducing @xmath36 including background and final state interactions other than the ispe diagrams @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this paper clearly shows that the peak structures can be reconstructed mainly by the ispe mechanism even including all the effects , i.e. , other diagrams and relative phases .    besides these predictions listed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we have given abundant phenomena of charged charmoniumlike structures by applying the ispe mechanism @xcite and the initial - single - chiral - particle - emisssion ( ische ) mechanism @xcite , which is an extension of the ispe mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the charged charmoniumlike structures with hidden - charm and open - strange channels in the @xmath37 invariant mass spectrum for the processes @xmath38 have been predicted in ref . @xcite . by studying the hidden - charm dipion decays of the charmoniumlike state @xmath39 with the ispe mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that there exist charged charmoniumlike structures near @xmath3 and @xmath4 thresholds in the @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 invariant mass spectra of the corresponding hidden - charm dipion decays of @xmath39 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ispe mechanism has been applied to the processes @xmath43 to predict the enhancement structures near the thresholds of @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , the besiii collaboration has announced another charged charmoniumlike structure @xmath46 in the recoil mass spectrum of @xmath47 at @xmath33 gev @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these novel phenomena of charged charmoniumlike structures have a common peculiarity , i.e. , all of them are either isovectors or isodoublets . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to ask whether there exists the corresponding isoscalar charmoniumlike structure as a partner of the predicted charged charmomiumlike structures . </S>",
    "<S> this question inspires our interest in further studying isoscalar charmoniumlike structures by choosing suitable decay processes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the investigations on the isoscalar charmonium - like structures will help us to reveal the nature of @xmath31 observed by the besiii and belle collaborations .    under the ische mechanism , the hidden - charm di - eta decays of higher charmonia and charmoniumlike states can be a good platform to search for isoscalar charmoniumlike structures since @xmath10 , @xmath48 and @xmath27 are chiral particles . in this work , we choose the processes , @xmath49/\\eta\\ \\left[d_s^{+(*)}{d}_s^{-(*)}\\right]\\to \\eta\\eta   j/\\psi,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the intermediate states of @xmath0 and @xmath50 which decay into @xmath51 . as a vector charmoniumlike state , @xmath0 was reported by belle in the @xmath52 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath53 @xcite , which was later confirmed by babar @xcite in the same process . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is a predicted charmonium with a quantum number @xmath54 , which is derived from the analysis of the experimental data with the resonance spectrum expansion model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these discussed hidden - charm di - eta decays are similar to the decays of higher charmonium or charmonium - like state into @xmath55 , where the difference lies in the isospin of the intermediate @xmath14 .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we consider only the hidden - charm di - eta decays resulted from the ische mechanism , which similarly provides the `` signal '' contribution . </S>",
    "<S> this study is the first step of the whole study similar to our former work of charged charmonium - like structures near the @xmath56 and @xmath4 thresholds in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in reality , there exist different contributions from different final state interactions when studying the hidden - charm di - eta decay , which are equivalent to the `` background '' contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the final result derived from interference between `` signal '' and `` background '' contributions gives the real invariant mass distributions of @xmath57 , where the total amplitude is expressed as @xmath58 . here to describe this interference the phase factor </S>",
    "<S> is introduced , which is crucial to understand the real invariant mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> however , the phase angle reflecting the interference can not be constrained by theory , i.e. , we can construct the lagrangians to describe the `` signal '' and `` background '' contributions by considering lorentz invariance and a certain symmetry , by which we further write out amplitudes @xmath59 and @xmath60 , but the phase angle @xmath61 can not be calculated and fixed here only from theory . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we have to wait for the corresponding experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> if the enough data are available in future , we can carry out the fit our prediction to the experimental data by including all contributions to the discussed hidden - charm di - eta decays , which is exactly what we have done in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see also ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    via the ische mechanism , </S>",
    "<S> the initial higher charmonium or charmoniumlike state first emits an @xmath10 meson , which carries continuous energy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> then , the charmonium or charmoniumlike state can dissolve into the intermediate @xmath14 and @xmath15 . due to the continuous energy distribution of the emitted @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> , the intermediate @xmath14 and @xmath15 with low momenta can easily transit into @xmath57 by exchanging a proper charm or charm - strange meson . </S>",

    "<S> mesons in the final state are identical , we give the distribution in terms of @xmath6 defined below , which denotes the maximum distribution of the @xmath57 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath63 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phsp ] , we present a sketch diagram of the phase space depending on @xmath64 and @xmath65 . the phase space is divided into two parts by the diagonal line of @xmath66 .    </S>",
    "<S> considering that the distribution is symmetric in @xmath64 and @xmath65 , i.e. , @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as shown in fig . [ </S>",

    "<S> the minimum of @xmath6 is @xmath72 , which is @xmath73 gev for @xmath7 and @xmath74 gev for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> one has to notice that the phase space has a sudden change at the point @xmath75 , which will lead to a turning point in the distributions of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this turning point appears at @xmath76 gev and @xmath77 gev for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .    separately considering the different intermediate state contributions , </S>",

    "<S> these turning points are due to the maximum distribution of the @xmath57 invariant mass spectrum itself rather than the ische mechanism .    as for @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , we present the following important information :    1 .   besides the turning points mentioned above , there do not exist other peaks in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : y4660 ] ( a ) and ( d ) , which is the same as the results for dipion decay cases . no peak caused by ische mechanism appears in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y4660 ] ( f ) , since the threshold of @xmath82 is 4224.6 mev , that is beyond the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y4660 ] ( b ) indicates the existence of another peak appearing in the @xmath6 distribution caused by ische mechanism with @xmath83 intermediate states . </S>",

    "<S> there are explicit enhancement structures in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y4660 ] ( c ) and ( e ) . as a broad structure , the enhancement in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y4660 ] ( c ) is around @xmath84 gev . while , the enhancement in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y4660 ] ( e ) is a sharp peak at @xmath85 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> similar to the above analysis of @xmath7 , in the following we also have some extra novel phenomena of @xmath86 , which include :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> there is an enhancement structure near @xmath87 gev as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y4790 ] ( e ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a small peak appears in the @xmath88 distribution in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y4790 ] ( f ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also notice a peak due to a threshold at @xmath89 gev in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y4790 ] ( c ) , which is resulted from the ische mechanism and is different from the turning point at @xmath77 gev mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the lineshapes listed in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y4790 ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( d ) show that the intermediate @xmath22 , @xmath3 , @xmath90 can not result in enhancement structures in the corresponding @xmath6 distributions except for peaks at the turning points .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the form factor dependence of the lineshapes obtained , where we consider monopole and dipole form factors in the calculation . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ffdep ] , we present the distribution of @xmath91 obtained by taking these two form factors , and compare their results , which show that the peak structures are not strongly dependent on the expressions of the form factor . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we also study @xmath92 dependence of the distribution of @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ffdep ] that the lineshapes for @xmath93 are not sensitive to @xmath92 , which is consistent with the observation in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where we once calculated @xmath92 dependence of the lineshapes of @xmath94 for the process @xmath95 as an example , which also indicates that the corresponding lineshapes are weakly dependent on the cutoff introduced in the form factor . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly we can conclude that the form factors and the parameter @xmath96 weakly affect the obtained lineshapes , especially in the vicinity of @xmath97 threshold .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the di - eta decay of the higher charmonia via the ische mechanism and predicted some enhancements around the thresholds of @xmath98 and @xmath99 . owing to the @xmath100 conservation , @xmath101 should be in @xmath102wave , while @xmath98 and @xmath99 are in @xmath103wave in the @xmath104 effective couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the stronger @xmath105-wave couplings mainly contribute to the ische mechanism , which may be the reason why there is no enhancement around @xmath101 threshold via the ische mechanism .    in the past decade experiments </S>",
    "<S> have made big progress on searching for charmoniumlike states @xmath106 , which also stimulated extensive theoretical studies on their properties . at present , it is still a hot and interesting topic to carry out both theoretical and experimental investigations on these @xmath106 states .    </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental observation of @xmath31 is a charged charmoniumlike state reported by besiii @xcite and confirmed by belle @xcite and ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it again draws our attention to a charmoniumlike state since a charged enhancement structure near the @xmath3 threshold was predicted in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite before this experimental observation , where the special mechanism ( ispe ) was applied to study the hidden - charm dipion decay of @xmath107 and other higher charmonia . </S>",
    "<S> our prediction confirmed by besiii also inspires our interest in applying and extending the ispe to provide more abundant phenomena of charged charmoniumlike structures @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although we already have given many predictions of charged charmoniumlike structures @xcite , we notice that the isoscalar charmoniumlike structures similar to the predicted charged ones are absent in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this work we have studied the hidden - charm di - eta decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to theoretically give the prediction of the isoscalar charmoniumlike structure . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that there are enhancement structures near @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 thresholds in the @xmath6 distribution of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath8 predict the enhancement structure near @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath9 thresholds in the corresponding @xmath6 distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we have not seen any enhancement in the intermediate @xmath108 channels in both @xmath109 processes . </S>",
    "<S> other than thresholds , we have found the turning points owing to the sudden change of the phase space.because we have separately given only lineshapes of different intermediates , we cannnot definitely claim that experiments should find these peaks due to the interferences between different mechanisms working in the higher charmonia and charmonium - like state decays .    </S>",
    "<S> these theoretical studies provide abundant information on isoscalar charmoniumlike structure , which will be helpful for further experimental exploration in future , where the potential experiments to search for the predicted enhancements in this work include besiii , belle , babar , and forthcoming belleii . </S>"
