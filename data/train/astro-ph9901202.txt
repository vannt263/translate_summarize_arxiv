    "the universidad complutense de madrid survey ( ucm survey ) has been carried out during the last several years with the aim of looking for h@xmath3 emission - line galaxies .",
    "it is described in detail by zamorano et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1996 ) , in ucm lists 1 & 2 .",
    "the ucm survey was initiated with several objectives , the main goals being : ( 1 ) to identify and study new young , low - metallicity galaxies ; ( 2 ) to carry out the classification and determination of the overall properties and completeness of the sample of emission - line galaxies ( elgs ) selected ; ( 3 ) to determine the spatial distribution and luminosity function of the new galaxy population .",
    "we also wished to compare our survey with others and to find out differences between the sample obtained with various objective - prism techniques and to study the overall relation between the far - infrared properties and the optical behavior of the star - forming galaxies .",
    "finally , we intended to determine the evolutionary status and the different underlying stellar populations of the objects in order to detect any effect of evolution in the starburst phenomena and to quantify the properties of the star formation in the local universe .",
    "the final product of lists 1 and 2 was the universidad complutense de madrid ( ucm ) sample of star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "this sample has been observed and analyzed in detail ( optical imaging : vitores et al .",
    "( 1996a , 1996b ) ; spectroscopy : gallego et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) ; near infrared imaging : alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , gil de paz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ) and has provided the luminosity function for the star - forming galaxies and the density of star formation rate in the local universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "lists 1 and 2 suffer from the subjective technique of looking for candidates by visual inspection of the plates through a 10@xmath4 binocular microscope .",
    "we intend to overcome this drawback by automatic selection on the digitized plates .",
    "this method was shown to provide good performance and improvement in the selection of candidates by applying it to several fields ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this work we present the ucm list 3 obtained after using the automatic detection process in nine contiguous fields covering 189 sq .",
    "section 2 describes the instrumental setup and observations . in section 3",
    "the method used to select the candidates is outlined .",
    "section 4 presents several parameters measured for every galaxy of the sample and explains the way they were obtained . in section 5",
    "the known selection effects are discussed .",
    "finally , some statistical properties and a comparison with other surveys are presented in section 6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "this survey is based on photographic plates obtained with the 80/120 cm f/3 schmidt telescope of the calar alto german - spanish observatory ( almera , spain ) ( @xcite ) in june 1993 .",
    "all the fields acquired for this research were obtained using the direct and objective - prism configurations . in both modes ,",
    "we use 8@xmath410 inch@xmath5 plates , covering an useful field of 4.4@xmath45.5 deg@xmath5 with a plate scale of 86@xmath6 mm@xmath7 .",
    "they were hypersensitized by baking them in an atmosphere of forming gas for 2 hr prior to exposure .",
    "full details of the plates are listed in table [ tbl - platedata ] .",
    "direct plates were obtained exposing iiiaj plates , combined with the gg385 filter , for 1 hour .",
    "this configuration gives an instrumental response similar to the johnson b band .",
    "prism plates were acquired in the red region of the spectrum . the use of iiiaf emulsion , with a sharp red cutoff at 6850 , and a rg630 filter provides an useful spectral range from @xmath8 6400 to 6850 .",
    "the objective - prism plates were obtained through a full aperture 4@xmath9 prism that yields a dispersion of 1980 mm@xmath7 at h@xmath3 ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "dispersion of the prism spectra runs n - s axis .",
    "our experience with the instrumental setup used indicates that exposures two hours long are a good balance between depth and plate background .",
    "this instrumental configuration registers the h@xmath3+[nii ] blend in emission for objects up to z@xmath100.045 .",
    "quality standards for the analyzed plates are good seeing , no cloud interference , no exposure interruption and telescope near the meridian .",
    "excellent guiding was achieved on this observing run by the use of the new automatic guiding system installed on the schmidt telescope .",
    "the plates were scanned using the mama machine , a high performance multichannel microdensitometer located at the observatoire de paris ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we used a pixel size and sampling step of 10@xmath11 m , the highest resolution achieved by the machine . each scanned plate returns a 23k@xmath418k pixel image at 0.86@xmath6 pix@xmath7 .",
    "figure [ fig - sky ] shows the fields covered by this discovery list .",
    "they are placed in two regions located in the areas @xmath12 ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; @xmath13 .",
    "the total surveyed area is 189 @xmath15 .",
    "in order to decrease the uncertainties intrinsic to visual scanning , we have developed a new method for the automatic selection of emission - line candidates in digitized objective - prism plates .",
    "the full procedure is described in detail in alonso et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and alonso ( 1996 ) . here",
    "we point out a brief discussion of the method .",
    "the first task must be to find all the objects on the plates . to locate and measure objects in the astronomical images",
    "we have developed a program that performs this job by thresholding the image a certain number of sigma over the local sky background .",
    "it returns a catalogue with several parameters as positions , sizes , fluxes , etc .",
    "for all the identified objects with a minimum selectable size .",
    "our buhofits software is able to handle large fits files up to our 23k@xmath418k pixel images .",
    "the large amount of spurious identifications due to emulsion flaws , plate scratches or satellite tracks are rejected by cross - correlating the catalogues obtained from direct and prism plates for the same field .",
    "we have used a plot of the logarithm of the area versus density flux to discern between stellar - like and extended objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently the spectrum of all the objects are extracted by adding the central five scans ( i.e. , those with higher signal ) , from the objective - prism image .",
    "these monodimensional spectra are obtained in arbitrary and instrumental density units .",
    "no calibration spots were recorded on the plates to obtain a photographic density to intensity relation . nevertheless the emission feature is clearly registered in these uncalibrated spectra and will be used in all the subsequent analysis . due to the spectrum extraction procedure",
    "it can be noted that we are missing those galaxies with emission out of the central region .",
    "this is one of our selection effects , but it only affects very bright , extended and well known galaxies .",
    "the emission - line galaxy candidates are selected by analyzing the prism spectra for all the objects .",
    "we use three different criteria in order to perform this selection , as is described in detail in alonso et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in our low dispersion and uncalibrated plates ,",
    "all the spectra show a similar appearance , mainly dominated by the instrumental response .",
    "only objects showing the h@xmath3 line in emission will present a clear discrepancy with respect to the continuum spectra of stars and galaxies without emission .",
    "the selection criteria are based in this fact , and allow to compute a selection index for each object that informs us about the reliability of the presence of an emission feature .",
    "the final sample is obtained after visual inspection of those objects with largest selection index .",
    "this step is needed because several different configurations like overlapping stars , emulsion scratches in the prism image , etc .",
    ", can produce extracted spectra with an apparent strong emission feature .",
    "the ucm survey had a typical success of 70% when looking for elgs ( lists 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the remaining 30% were confirmed to be objects showing no emission .",
    "the automatic method has proved to improve these results ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in these studies",
    "we have compared the samples of elg obtained after visual and automatic search in two fields .",
    "the new technique recovers nearly 80% of the objects detected by visual scanning .",
    "all of the objects not recovered by the automatic method are extended and very bright galaxies or galaxies with emission knots out of the nucleus . moreover , with the automatic method we see an enhancement in the number of confirmed candidates selected . as it is shown in alonso et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and alonso ( 1996 ) an increase of 24% in the total number of objects with confirmed h@xmath3 emission has been reached with respect to the visual inspection .",
    "we have put special attention into improving the extraction of information from our uncalibrated photographic plates .",
    "several parameters have been obtained with intermediate accuracy for all the candidates .",
    "table [ tbl - ucmlist3 ] presents the full information for the objects of the third list of our survey .",
    "column ( 1 ) contains the name of the galaxy according to the iau rules .",
    "equatorial coordinates for j2000.0 are given in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "column ( 4 ) presents an estimate of the b magnitude obtained from our photographic plates ( see  4.4 ) . in columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we present the size at the 25 mag arcsec@xmath16 isophote , in arcsec , and the position angle ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "estimated redshifts are listed in column ( 7 ) ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "column ( 8) gives a preliminary morphological classification derived by visual analysis of the digitized sky survey ( dss ) images , whereas column ( 9 ) classifies each candidate into three categories according to the strength of the emission seen in the prism plates .",
    "the meaning of the codes used in these columns are presented in the caption of the table .",
    "finally , column ( 10 ) shows previous designations of the candidates .",
    "finding charts from the dss are included in figure [ fig - chart ] .",
    "the parameters listed in the table are estimations , since spectroscopic and photometric studies have not been carried out .",
    "because our uncalibrated plates do not permit us to directly obtain absolute parameters for the objects , we have performed several external calibrations by relating our photographic parameters with calibrated data for a small subsample of objects obtained from different catalogues .",
    "however this approximation does not allow high accuracy and some of the calibrations are not even possible .",
    "this occurs if we try to measure the ew(h@xmath3 ) in our spectra , for which we will need a density to intensity calibration and , more important , a large sample of emission - line galaxies with known ew(h@xmath3 ) for each plate in order to obtain a well sampled relation .",
    "next we briefly describe the procedure followed for obtaining each parameter .",
    "we follow a standard procedure performed during the plate scan by the mama machine in order to derive the constants for the plate astrometry .",
    "a third - order polynomial transformation is derived by using astrometric reference stars from the ppm catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rms in the residuals of the astrometric reductions are about 0.3@xmath6 , although large deviations can be achieved for very extended objects with several components .",
    "columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of table [ tbl - ucmlist3 ] catalogue the coordinates of the candidates referred to the equinox j2000.0 .      during the object scanning process",
    ", we obtain the photographic major and minor axis and the position angle for each detected object by fitting an ellipse to pixels with a photographic density 3@xmath17 over the local plate background .",
    "the sizes of a galaxy measured directly in the plate can not be straightforwardly converted to sizes in arc - seconds via the plate scale because of the photographic plate behavior .",
    "an ideal point of light is spread on the photographic emulsion over a wide area , and this effect grows with the source brightness .",
    "hence , the size measured directly on the plate is a function of the real size of the source , the magnitude , also the luminosity profile for an extended source .",
    "we have calibrated our photographic sizes with known galaxies , using the catalogue of principal galaxies ( pgc ) in its electronic version extragalactic card index system ( ecis ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "this catalogue has the advantage of being homogeneous , where sizes are all referred to the isophote 25 mag arcsec@xmath16 ( @xcite ) . in figure [ fig - size ]",
    "we show the calibration derived for a single field .",
    "the other plates follow similar relations .",
    "figure also shows that the instrumental mama sizes are systematically smaller than such obtained from the pgc .",
    "this fact is due to both the notably less depth of our photographic plates and the method used to obtain the sizes ( thresholding the image 3@xmath17 over the local background ) .",
    "nevertheless , the calibrations derived allow us to estimate the size of our candidates within an uncertainty of 20@xmath6 .",
    "higher precision could be achieved with more homogeneous data . in alonso ( 1996 )",
    "an error of 2  was obtained calibrating with photometry for the ucm galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the position angle is adopted as the orientation of the fitted ellipse .",
    "there is no need for a calibration with external data , but a checking was made using the same ecis catalogue cited above .",
    "this provided an estimation of the error , being 8  for 1@xmath17 .",
    "for very elongated galaxies the error should be notably smaller .",
    "the measurement of the redshift of the elg candidates in our photographic plates requires a wavelength calibration of the spectra .",
    "this calibration involves obtaining the prism dispersion and requires the knowledge of a reference point at a specific wavelength for each spectrum .",
    "the prism disperses the light by means of the changing refractive index with the following dependence on wavelength , in first order :    @xmath18    where a , b are two constants .",
    "thus , the position of a certain spectral feature in the objective - prism image will follow the same dependency :    @xmath19    here , the @xmath20 constant depends on the reference point we choose , whereas the @xmath21 constant is only related to the characteristics of the prism .    in order to obtain the dispersion curve for the 4  objective prism of the calar - alto schmidt telescope",
    "a test plate was taken .",
    "the configuration used was iiiaf emulsion without a filter . with a short exposure",
    "the prism spectra of several bright stars were registered , covering a spectral range from the blue atmospheric cut - off until 6850  due to the sharp red cut - off of the iiia - f emulsion .",
    "the dispersion curve was obtained by measuring the position of the strong absorption balmer lines of a stars .",
    "fitting the data to the following expression ( @xcite ) ( see figure [ fig - po ] )    @xmath22    yields a value of b=(-713 @xmath23 2 ) 10@xmath24 @xmath5 @xmath11 m . to measure the wavelength of the h@xmath3 feature in the prism spectra",
    "we also need the knowledge of a reference point .",
    "the emulsion red cut - off at @xmath8 6850  can not be used due to its high dependency with brightness , color and size .",
    "we have used instead the astrometric reduction to obtain a constant reference point for all the spectra .",
    "this point is obtained by converting the position of the object from the direct to the prism plate .",
    "we do not know the wavelength of this reference point , but it will be the same for all the spectra , even for different plates , where we have applied the same astrometric reduction , and it will not be affected by the effects previously noted ( size , brightness and color ) . only when the emission comes out of center of the galaxy",
    "the method clearly fails .",
    "two identical galaxies showing h@xmath3 emission , the first one in the nucleus and the second one in an external knot would show the emission line in different location of their prism spectra with respect to a same reference point , obtained from the plate to plate transformation . therefore this fact would yield an erroneous value of the redshift for the second one .    in order to obtain the wavelength of this reference point , that is , the value of the constant @xmath20 we represent the redshift ( @xmath25 ) of known galaxies with respect to the h@xmath3 position in the prism spectrum , relative to the reference point ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this relation must follow the expression :    @xmath27{\\frac{b}{\\delta x(\\mu m)-a}}-\\lambda_0}{\\lambda_0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is 6562.8  if we are working with the h@xmath3 line",
    ". therefore we can calculate the value of @xmath20 by applying an algorithm of minimum squares to the data .",
    "the value of such constant , obtained separately for the nine fields , yields the same results inside 1@xmath17 error bar , confirming the procedure .    assuming an uncertainty of 1 pixel in the determination of the center of the line , and taking into account the rms in the calibration fit , the typical error in the computation of the redshift results 0.004 for 1@xmath17 ( i.e. 1200 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "in figure [ fig - calz ] we present the data obtained applying the method just described for an small subsample of galaxies with known redshifts in order to test our procedure .",
    "the galaxies showing large deviations are explained noting that the method may fail when the galaxy is very extended and the emission feature comes from a external knot .",
    "this is the case of ucm1436 + 2245 ( iras 14360 + 2245 ) , with a redshift of 0.04 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we apply our method it gives an estimate of z=0.017 due to the presence of a double component emission probably originating in different knots .",
    "column 7 of table [ tbl - ucmlist3 ] presents the redshift obtained for non - catalogued candidates .",
    "data marked with an asterisk are obtained from literature .",
    "obviously , these redshifts are based in the assumption that the emission feature registered in the prism spectra is the h@xmath3 line .",
    "this conjecture is based in the fact that none of the confirmed emission - line galaxies from the previous ucm lists 1 & 2 was revealed as distant galaxies with their emission lines redshifted to our spectral coverage .",
    "in addition , a galaxy with a m@xmath29 magnitude , located at z=0.3 will show the [ oiii]5007 line in the h@xmath3 region , but the apparent magnitude would be notably fainter than the limit of our prism plates ( m@xmath30 18 ) .",
    "the direct plates were obtained with an instrumental response near the b band of the johnson system , and therefore we are interested in measuring the magnitudes of our elg sample .",
    "our plates are not calibrated , but we can relate the photographic flux , the sum of the density for all the pixels of the image , with the b magnitude for objects recovered from databases .",
    "this relation works fine for stellar objects ( @xmath31 ) , but it is not straightforward to apply to extended objects because the dependence with the size of the source . using both photographic density and size it is possible to estimate the magnitudes , but with larger errors , up to 0.5 mag for very extended galaxies .",
    "several studies have been published which have achieved better accuracy using photographic plates , but in general all of them require calibration spots ( @xcite ) or the calibration give good results only in photometry for stellar - like objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in general",
    ", the photometry of extended sources has several sources of error sometimes hard to correct for ( see @xcite ) .",
    "b magnitudes listed in column ( 4 ) of table [ tbl - ucmlist3 ] are derived using the method just described above , and should be used only as estimates for statistical or observational purposes . only values for compact galaxies",
    "can be taken with greater confidence .",
    "one of the major problems encountered when working with photographic plates is that the characteristics of each of them can vary notably with respect to the other ones , even taking special care in repeating all the observational setup , being almost impossible to obtain a homogeneous sample of galaxies .",
    "in order to understand the biases of our observational procedure , we have compared the samples of galaxies obtained in our survey with those recovered by using different observational configurations .",
    "this job is presented in detail in zamorano et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1996 ) for the ucm lists 1 & 2 , and is also presented in section 7 of this paper for this new list 3 .    nevertheless in this section",
    "we have used the spectroscopic data derived for the two previous lists of the ucm survey ( @xcite ) with the aim of investigating the observational biases of our instrumental configuration .",
    "this analysis ( @xcite ) shows that neither the equivalent width ( ew ) of the emission nor the flux of the h@xmath3 line alone are the parameters that controls the detection limit in prism surveys .",
    "moss et al . ( 1988 ) introduced an auxiliary parameter defined as ew@xmath4flux , and showed that it defined accurately the observational limit of their work , an objective - prism survey in the red region of the spectrum , at a reciprocal dispersion of 400 mm@xmath7 .",
    "we have also used this parameter in our survey . in figure [ fig - histoewf ]",
    "we show the histogram of values ew()@xmath4flux(erg",
    "s@xmath7 cm@xmath16 ) for the sample of ucm galaxies from lists 1 & 2 .",
    "we can conclude that the ucm survey is able to identify emission - line galaxies with a value of log(ew@xmath4flux ) @xmath33 -13 .",
    "only four objects have lower values of this parameter . nevertheless three of them have redshifts larger than the limit imposed by the emulsion sensitivity , being impossible to register the h@xmath3 emission .",
    "these objects must be considered as serendipitous identifications .    in figure [ fig - ewf ]",
    "we show the distribution of the ucm objects of the lists 1 & 2 in a log(flux ) vs. log(ew ) plot .",
    "the data have been obtained from the work of gallego et al .",
    "the plot shows the behavior of a sample obtained by prism plates .",
    "it also shows the lack of galaxies in the upper - left and lower - right corners .",
    "these two regions belong to very bright and faint galaxies respectively .",
    "therefore the diagram shows that , in addition to a limiting magnitude , there exists a deficiency of bright galaxies due to saturation of the photographic plates .",
    "we can not represent the location of the galaxies obtained in this list 3 until performing spectroscopic observations .",
    "nevertheless , these effects are due not to the visual or automatic procedure to select the candidates , but to the intrinsic characteristics of the photographic emulsion .",
    "this is why we expect a similar response for the galaxies identified in this list .",
    "the histogram of apparent magnitudes presented in figure [ fig - histom ] informs us about the depth of the survey .",
    "nearly all the galaxies lie between 16 and 18 in b magnitude , with a few reaching magnitude 20 .",
    "the mean apparent b magnitude for the sample is 16.8 .",
    "this histogram shows a known bias of this technique , that is , it is unable to detect bright galaxies because they appear saturated in the photographic plates .",
    "this occurs , for example , for several known galaxies as ngc 5637 ( m@xmath34=14.7 ) or was 82 ( m@xmath34=15.5 ) .",
    "we also have presented the histogram of gunn - thuan r magnitudes obtained from the ucm lists 1 & 2 . assuming a mean color b - r=0.65 for the ucm sample of galaxies , a typical value for scd galaxies ( fukugita et al .",
    "1995 ; vitores et al .",
    "1996b ) , the comparison points out that ucm list 3 seems to be slightly deeper that the previous ones , although lack of precision in our b magnitudes prevents us from extending these conclusions .",
    "we note that the large number of galaxies in the ucm list 1 & 2 histogram is due to the greater explored area compared with this list 3 .",
    "figure [ fig - histoabs ] shows the histogram in absolute magnitude .",
    "the mean absolute magnitude is @xmath35 .",
    "this histogram is less symmetrical than the distribution of @xmath36 derived from lists 1 & 2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "our coverage of the low luminosity end of the luminosity function is by far better than previous ucm lists .",
    "it is worth noting than galaxies with @xmath37 as faint as -15 have been detected .",
    "such percentage of low luminosity galaxies has been also reached for the university of michigan survey for emission - line galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have computed the mean surface brightness using the apparent blue magnitude and the size referred to the isophote 25 mag arcsec@xmath16 .",
    "the mean surface brightness of our sample is distributed almost uniformly from 21.5 to 24.5 mag arcsec@xmath16 with 22.8 being the mean value ( see figure [ fig - histosurf ] )",
    ". lists 1 & 2 yield a mean surface brightness of 22 mag arcsec@xmath16 in the gunn - thuan r band ( @xcite ) .",
    "the precision of our data prevents us to extend this study to filter or color differences .    in figure [ fig - surf ]",
    "we plot b magnitude vs. surface brightness for the sample .",
    "the bcd type galaxies are mainly distinguished because of their low luminosity and high surface brightness .",
    "the right side of the plot is populated by such galaxies .",
    "considering an upper limit of @xmath38 ( @xcite ) for a bcd galaxy , we have regarded those galaxies with a compact aspect and a more conservative @xmath39 as good candidates to be bcd galaxies attending to this criteria the most probable candidates for bcd s are : ucm1345 + 2417 , ucm1413 + 2446 , ucm1449 + 2559 , ucm1735 + 2617 , ucm1742 + 2343 and ucm1742 + 2634 .",
    "other type of galaxies found in this region are irregular galaxies with strange morphologies such as comet  like shapes , double  component , etc .",
    "such galaxies are ucm1640 + 2238 , ucm1721 + 2326 , ucm1723 + 2556 and so they were not included in the bcd sample .      in figure [ fig - pie ]",
    "we show the spatial distribution of our sample for both the 14@xmath40 and the 16@xmath40 regions .",
    "the dots represent galaxies from the cfa survey ( @xcite ) which have been plotted to show for the normal galaxy distribution .",
    "it can be seen that several clustering structures appear in the cfa data .",
    "a well - defined cluster is at 5000 km / s and three more at 9000 km / s , 9500 km / s and 11000 km / s ( beyond the ucm instrumental limit in redshift ) in the 14@xmath40 field . in the @xmath41 sector",
    "only one cluster is observed at 10000 km / s . at such redshift",
    ", we detect no galaxies .",
    "we have presented the location of the ucm galaxies using open circles .",
    "they nearly follow the distribution of the cfa survey , althogh less clustering seems to appear .",
    "preliminary analysis points out the idea that preferred galaxy location could be related with physical size .",
    "the ucm survey has found 113 candidates in the 9 fields ( 189 deg@xmath42 ) of this list 3 .",
    "the overall density is around 0.59 candidates per square degree , slightly greater that the value derived from ucm lists 1 & 2 .",
    "it is worth noting that the actual density of galaxies with h@xmath3 emission ( excluding candidates with no emission ) is @xmath8 0.4 for the first lists ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the properties of the automatic method is a better success rate of detection ( @xcite ) ( which will be determined for this survey with follow - up spectroscopy ) .",
    "therefore this value is consistent with an improvement in the number of galaxies detected .",
    "although we have lost some bright and extended galaxies , at fainter magnitudes the automatic procedure is more sensitive , providing an increase in the number of galaxies per square degree .    in lists 1 & 2 some comparisons were made between the samples detected with different surveys and observational techniques , and that obtained by us .",
    "the conclusions we derived do not change when the new ucm fields surveyed are added to the comparison .",
    "following kinman ( 1984 ) the cgcg galaxies have been used as the reference sample of galaxies in the field .",
    "only 26 galaxies out of 242 galaxies with known redshift z@xmath430.04 have been found with emission .",
    "the ratio is @xmath811% , similar to the 13% found in the previous lists .",
    "the ucm list 3 fields do not overlap completely with the kug survey ( kiso ultraviolet - excess galaxies , takase et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ) .",
    "if we restrict our analysis to the common region ( @xmath44 ) , the kug survey has found 94 objects and ucm 26 candidates ; only 7 have been selected by both surveys .",
    "thus only 27% of ucm galaxies are also kug objects . since the kug survey selects objects by their colors , it is not redshift limited .",
    "we expect that a fraction of the kugs have a redshift that prevents detection by us . for comparison comte et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found 25% of kugs with @xmath45 .",
    "the number density of kugs is 1.8 objects per square degree for the total survey and outnumber the surface density of ucm by a factor of 3 .",
    "there are 5 galaxies of the wasilewski ( 1983 ) catalogue of emission - line galaxies that have been also detected by our survey .",
    "although the detection technique is similar ( objective - prism ) , he used iiiaj emulsion to register h@xmath46 and [ oiii ] lines .",
    "the one galaxy undetected by us is was82 ( m@xmath47=15.5 ) due to a saturation problem ( see  6 ) .",
    "we have presented the ucm survey list 3 .",
    "this new research is the scientific continuation of the previous two lists , but in this last list we have applied an automatic procedure developed and tested by us in a previous work in order to improve the results obtained up to now with the visual search of candidates .",
    "this list 3 covers 189 sq .",
    "deg . in nine fields , and yields a total number of 113 candidate h@xmath3 emission - line galaxies , giving an overall density of 0.59 candidates per square degree .",
    "the nine fields were acquired in direct and objective - prism modes , and the plates were scanned using the mama machine . this procedure has permitted us to recover a great amount of information directly from the plates , allowing to perform statistical analysis of the sample before carrying out photometric or spectroscopic observations .",
    "we have derived high precision coordinates , magnitudes in the blue band , sizes and redshifts for the whole sample of candidates , all with moderate and known errors . because we work with uncalibrated plates ,",
    "all these parameters are obtained by comparing our photographic data with several parameters for objects recovered from various databases .",
    "these external calibrations allow for the determination of the parameters noted above .",
    "the determination of the dispersion curve of the prism used in the survey has permitted us to estimate the redshift for the whole sample of candidates by measuring the position of the h@xmath3 line in the prism spectrum related to the location of a constant reference point obtained using the astrometric calibration .",
    "the @xmath48 error in the computation of the redshift by this method results 0.004 ( 1200 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "the comparison with known objects shows the precision of the method developed .",
    "the photometric data obtained for the sample ( apparent and absolute magnitudes and sizes ) follow the behavior derived for the two previous lists using specific photometric observations .",
    "this result suggests that the automatic procedure selects a sample of galaxies comparable with those obtained in the previous lists .",
    "the success of the new automatic procedure adopted in this new third list is both the establishment of objective criteria for the selection of candidates and the extraction of several quantitative parameters , in comparison with the lack of such information from previous visual - based lists .",
