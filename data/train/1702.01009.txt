    "in the standard cosmological model , the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales . the seeds of present - day large - scale structure of the universe are formed from the highly gaussian and nearly scale - invariant power spectrum of matter density @xcite . however , on small scales , the hierarchical clustering of matter leads to formations of complex cosmic structure such as clusters of galaxies , walls , filaments , and voids @xcite . among all of the large - scale objects in the universe , cosmic voids , which are large underdensities in the matter distribution ,",
    "occupy the vast majority of the universe and hence provide the largest volume - based test on theories of structure formation @xcite .",
    "being interesting objects in their own right , they contain a wealth of information on the fundamental properties of the universe .",
    "for example , the low - density environment of voids is a perfect place to study galaxies , as the galaxies are expected not to be affected by the complex astrophysical processes that modify galaxies in high - density environments and allows galaxies to evolve independently without environmental effects @xcite .",
    "in addition , since voids occupy the cosmic volume where the matter density is lowest , the difference between dark energy and modified gravity models for cosmic acceleration could be distinguishable within cosmic voids @xcite .",
    "the computational approach called @xmath14-body dark matter simulations is one of the best tools to empirically understand various void properties such as number functions @xcite and void ellipticity functions @xcite .",
    "however , the definition of voids is rather vague , and various definitions exist in the literature ; some are more suitable for theoretical calculations , while the others are more suitable for observations or @xmath14-body simulations .",
    "this variety of definitions renders comparison of theoretical predictions on void properties and observations difficult . `",
    "zobov ` ( zones bordering on voidness ; @xcite ) and ` wvf ` ( watershed void finder;@xcite ) are two of the popular void - finding algorithms .",
    "both methods are based on some tessellation methods and the watershed concept of defining voids . `",
    "zobov ` requires no free parameters or assumptions about the shape and is based on voronoi tessellation .",
    "however , the ` zobov ` voids are unsmooth and rather edgy . `",
    "wvf ` also requires no free parameters and is based on a watershed transform .",
    "however , ` wvf ` uses several techniques to smooth the density field so that the ` wvf ` voids are not edgy . with void identification algorithms being progressively developed for galaxy redshift surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ,",
    "cosmic voids are being continually found , amounting to releases of public voids catalogs @xcite .",
    "recently , there has be an increasing amount of attention on voids as objects for various aspects of cosmological studies .",

    ", one would expect the difference in radial and transverse direction to be directly related to the product of angular distance and the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "another geometrical study , the evolution of the ellipticity of voids , could be used as a tool in practice to constrain the dark energy equation of state @xcite .",

    "the gravitational anti - lensing effect of voids has been recently investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "@xcite has released lensing potential maps from the cmb ] that utilized quadratic estimators that exploit the statistical anisotropy induced by lensing @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , if the matter density distribution within a void , known as a void profile , is known , then the lensing potential could be computed and vice versa . the statistical average void density profile known as the universal void profile ( here after , hsw ; @xcite ) has been released and potentially could be exploited to predict the lensing effect of voids at various sizes and redshifts with only a few parameters ( more in  [ sec : theory ] ) . hence , from the lensing potential data from _ planck _ , one could , in principle , derive the hsw parameters .",

    "the negative value of @xmath1 indicates that on average the voids in sdss data are in a locally underdense region , which is also confirmed by the integrated mass discussed previously .",
    "this effect could be seen from the lensing potential shown in figure .",
    "[ fig : lensp_long ] .",
    "since the deflection angle is equal to the gradient of the lensing potential @xmath249 , the nonzero gradient of the lensing potential at large radius indicates that there is some residue lensing power .",
    "the lensing power mainly comes from the deficit ( or excess ) mass from the voids ( or clusters ) .",
    "the constancy of the gradient translates into the constancy of the excess mass .",
    "our mcmc has shown that this residue power is caused by the mass deficit by having a negative value of @xmath1 . however , this comes with the caveat , as stated in @xcite , that the lensing potential has a very red spectrum and when cutting the map into small regions it could cause a leakage issue .",
    "this is the reason the team chose to release the lensing convergence rather than the potential . and for our purposes we need to convert it back to the lensing potential (  [ ssec : planckdata ] ) .    to justify the necessity of the environment parameter , the best - fit lensing potentials from the models with and without the environment parameter are shown in figure .",
    "[ fig : compare ] . the likelihood ratios between the models with and without the environment parameter @xmath250 are 1.01 , 1.36 , and 77.4 for data - i , data - ii , and data - iii , respectively , for cmass1 . without taking the penalty of an additional parameter in @xmath251 into account",
    ", we could see that the environment parameter is preferred in data - iii , while it is less preferable for data - i and data - ii .",
    "the best - fit parameters for all samples and models are shown in table .",
    "[ tab : fittingparams ] . from table .",
    "[ tab : fittingparams ] , the significant detection levels for the environment parameter for data - i , data - ii and data - iii are approximately @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 for data - i , data - ii , and , data - iii , respectively , for the cmass1 sample respectively .",
    "the general results hold similarly for the cmass2 sample .    to analyze the effect of @xmath1 on the other parameters",

    "the effects of how the hsw parameters alter the shape of the void profile are explicitly shown in figure .  8 in @xcite . in both models ,",
    "the values of @xmath94 between the two models are not much different given the uncertainties in the values  the values differ by @xmath255 .",
    "the similarity in the values of @xmath94 indicates that the extensions of the compensation region are similar .",
    "however , the values of @xmath80 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are significantly different by @xmath256 , @xmath257 , and @xmath258 , respectively .",
    "@xmath80 describes the slope of the underdense region , @xmath59 describes the depth of the void profile , and @xmath60 is the zero - crossing radius . in general , model b ( with @xmath1 ) gives a shallower void profile than the model a ( without @xmath1 ) by having smaller values of @xmath80 and @xmath59 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath1 has a direct degenerate effect with both @xmath80 and @xmath59lowering the mean density could be compensated by having a shallower profile .",
    "attempts to recover or fit the hsw void parameters are found in ( * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter , ) . in , the stacked void profiles for different radii and redshifts are compared between a mock luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) catalog from the jubilee simulation and the sdss lrg and main galaxy samples .",
    "they have found that the void profiles from the simulations and the sdss galaxy samples matched . investigated the redshift - space distortions between pairs of galaxies from a mock galaxies catalog with hod parameters from @xcite and @xcite and stacked voids in redshift space .",
    "the inference on the hsw void parameters was made by assuming the gaussian streaming model , where the distribution of the pairwise line - of - sight velocities is assumed to be gaussian .",
    "the hsw parameters in and are @xmath259 and @xmath260 respectively .",
    "the main differences in the parameter constraints from our work and theirs are from the different methodology used in deriving the parameters and the inclusion of @xmath1 .",
    "we also notice that the value of @xmath59 between ( observationally derived ) and our value , especially for data - i , are similar , while the value of @xmath59 from ( mock catalog derived ) is remarkably different .",
    "this may indicate a systematic bias between the sdss samples and the mock catalog .    to summarize this work ,",
    "we cross - correlated the _ planck _ lensing map with 516 voids found in the sdss data and stacked them to obtain the stacked lensing potential from voids . from the stacked void lensing potential",
    ", we recover the hsw void parameter from three different data sets : data - i to @xmath261 , data - ii to @xmath262 , and data - iii to @xmath263 . we have found that it is necessary to include the environment parameter in the void profile to obtain a good fit to the data .",
