    "meridional circulation , driven by ekman pumping , occurs routinely in the atmospheres , oceans , and fluid interiors of rapidly rotating astrophysical objects .",
    "indeed , it is a generic feature of navier  stokes flow in any spherical couette geometry ( i.e. , a differentially rotating , spherical shell ) ; see @xcite for a review . as the ekman number @xmath2 decreases , and the differential rotation increases , spherical couette flow becomes nonaxisymmetric and eventually turbulent @xcite . in the limit of rapid overall rotation , a detached shear layer , known as the stewartson layer , forms along the tangent cylinder to the inner sphere @xcite .",
    "it can be disrupted by nonaxisymmetric instabilities .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that a multiplicity of transition states are thereby excited @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of an unstable stewartson layer in a differentially rotating neutron star has important astrophysical consequences .",
    "this is true especially if the inner core rotates faster than the rest of the star , like in the earth , a real possibility in models where the inner core makes a transition to a crystalline color - superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "recently , the importance of the global flow pattern inside a neutron star to the phenomenon of pulsar glitches has been highlighted by simulations on the vortex @xcite and hydrodynamic @xcite levels .",
    "observational data suggest that glitches result from scale - invariant vortex avalanches driven by differential rotation @xcite .",
    "if the meridional circulation is fast enough , a vortex tangle is alternately created and destroyed , producing impulsive and oscillatory torque variations @xcite .",
    "the presence of a stewartson layer modifies these conclusions and those of other studies ( e.g. , of stellar oscillations ) , where a multicomponent superfluid is perturbed starting from a nontrivial equilibrium state @xcite .    to date",
    ", no studies have been published of the formation and stability of a stewartson layer in _ superfluid _ spherical couette flow . in this letter , we present the first numerical simulation of such a system as an idealized model of the superfluid outer core of a neutron star .",
    "we calculate stability curves for a range of unstable nonaxisymmetric modes and compare the conditions for instability with observational glitch data , finding an upper limit on the velocity shear and hence the glitch sizes observed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : hydro ] , we briefly review the analytic and numerical theory of stewartson layers in viscous fluids , before calculating the structure of a steady stewartson layer in a @xmath4s@xmath5-paired neutron superfluid . in ",
    "[ sec : unstable ] , we study the stability of the layer to nonaxisymmetric perturbations as a function of ekman number @xmath2 and rossby number @xmath3 . in ",

    "consider a viscous fluid flowing inside a differentially rotating spherical container , with inner radius ( angular frequency ) @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , outer radius ( angular frequency ) @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , rossby number @xmath10 , and ekman number @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the kinematic viscosity . in a frame corotating with the outer sphere , the fluid outside",
    "the cylinder tangential to the inner sphere is at rest , while the fluid inside the tangent cylinder moves in a columnar fashion @xcite .",
    "fluid is expelled ( sucked in ) by ekman layers at @xmath13 ( @xmath6 ) , while a triple - deck stewartson layer buffers the jump in angular velocity across the tangent cylinder .",
    "it consists of an inner layer of thickness @xmath14 sandwiched between layers of thicknesses @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) just inside ( outside ) the tangent cylinder @xcite .",
    "the ekman layers scale as @xmath17 , except near the equator of the inner sphere , where they scale as @xmath18 .    a superfluid stewartson layer in a spherical shell exhibits a similar structure .",
    "figure [ fig : stew1]a graphs the angular velocity in the rotating frame as a function of the cylindrical radius @xmath19 , for @xmath20 ( upper curve ) , @xmath21 ( middle curve ) , and @xmath22 ( lower curve ) , with @xmath23 .",
    "the layer starts at cylindrical radius @xmath24 and its thickness decreases with decreasing @xmath2 , extending out to @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 . in viscous flows , the thickness of the layer changes by less than @xmath29 % for @xmath30 @xcite ;",
    "similar behaviour is observed here .",
    "the inner ekman layers are thicker at the equator .",
    "figure [ fig : stew1]b displays meridional streamlines for @xmath20 ( left ) , @xmath21 ( center ) and @xmath22 ( right ) , with @xmath31 .",
    "the stewartson layer is visible along the tangent cylinder , narrowing from left to right .",
    "the streamlines are drawn in the rotating frame of the outer sphere ; the blank region to the right of the tangent cylinder indicates that the fluid there is at rest . the characteristic meridional speed in the layer scales as @xmath32 .",
    "to obtain the results in figure [ fig : stew1 ] , we solve the two - component hall - vinen - bekarevich - khalatnikov ( hvbk ) equations for a superfluid inside a spherical differentially rotating shell , with @xmath33 , using a pseudospectral collocation and time - split method @xcite .",
    "the details of the calculation will be set out in a longer paper .",
    "boundary conditions assume the presence of an inner core or a transition between a @xmath34 and @xmath35 superfluid @xcite .",
    "we ignore vortex pinning and proton - neutron entrainment for simplicity , although recent work shows it to be important @xcite .",
    "we adopt no - slip and no - penetration boundary conditions for the normal fluid component ( velocity @xmath36 ) and no - penetration for the superfluid component ( velocity @xmath37 ) , ignoring the small tension force to reduce the order of the equation for @xmath37 by one [ see @xcite and @xcite for a discussion ] .",
    "the mutual friction force is taken to have the anisotropic hall - vinen form [ @xmath38 , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite ] , with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the normal and superfluid mass density fractions respectively , where @xmath45 denotes the total density @xcite .",
    "the stewartson layer is disrupted when @xmath3 exceeds a threshold @xmath46(@xmath2 ) , which decreases as @xmath2 increases , exciting a kelvin ",
    "helmholtz  type instability . @xcite and @xcite investigated thoroughly the most unstable modes of a viscous fluid stewartson layer .",
    "they discovered nonaxisymmetric instabilities for azimuthal modes @xmath47 , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the azimuthal mode number of the most unstable mode increases with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite discovered empirically the scaling @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "for @xmath52 , the most unstable mode is almost always @xmath53 , with @xmath54 being excited in the range @xmath55 . in this regime",
    ", @xcite found @xmath56 .",
    "the asymmetry with the sign of @xmath3 is still not understood physically @xcite .    here",
    ", we generalize the numerical calculation of @xmath46 to a superfluid stewartson layer .",
    "we follow a two - stage recipe . first , for fixed @xmath31",
    ", we calculate axisymmetric hvbk basic states for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath57 , @xmath22 , and @xmath58 .",
    "second , we linearize the hvbk equations around the base state and test the stability of a given @xmath59 perturbation ( typical amplitude @xmath60 % ) by increasing @xmath3 until the mode grows exponentially . we obtain the scaling @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we concentrate our efforts on @xmath64 , the most unstable mode at @xmath65 for viscous fluids ( and also for the superfluid ) .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath64 is not the most unstable mode at smaller ekman numbers ( e.g. @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is more unstable ) , but the critical rossby number is unaffected ( @xmath68 ) . in ",
    "[ sec : unstable ] , we extrapolate the scaling ( [ eq : sscale ] ) to the regime @xmath69 , @xmath70 , relevant to radio pulsars @xcite , where numerical simulations are too hard to do .",
    "a more thorough parameter survey will be presented in a future paper .",
    "nonaxisymmetric instabilities can decrease the shear inside a viscous stewartson layer by 30 % @xcite .",
    "we observe a similar but less pronounced effect in the superfluid , e.g. when the mode @xmath64 is excited at @xmath71 , with @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ fig : topol ] describes the topology of the flow in the layer , before ( figure [ fig : topol]a , @xmath73 ) and after ( figure [ fig : topol]b , @xmath74 ) the mode @xmath64 is excited .",
    "the discriminant @xmath75 , with @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , distinguishes between regions that are focal ( @xmath79 , blue ) and strain - dominated ( @xmath80 , green ) @xcite .",
    "the maximum shear changes from @xmath81 at @xmath82 to @xmath83 at @xmath84 ( cf .",
    "viscous fluid , where the observed change is from @xmath85 to @xmath86 ) .",
    "the hexagonal flow structure also boosts the torque one must exert on the inner sphere to maintain the shear , although the increase is less dramatic ( @xmath87 % ) .",
    "as @xmath2 and @xmath3 control the stability of the stewartson layer , it is interesting to test whether the amplitude and rate of incidence of rotational irregularities like glitches are related to these two dimensionless quantities . in order to calculate @xmath2 , we need to know how @xmath12 depends on the density @xmath88 and temperature @xmath89 in the outer core . using the neutron - neutron scattering viscosity formula derived by @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath90 with @xmath91 g @xmath92 . the core temperature @xmath89 is related to the surface temperature @xmath93 , e.g. , via the two - zone heat - blanket model of @xcite , which gives @xmath94 .",
    "we estimate @xmath93 from the characteristic age @xmath95 , combined with theoretical cooling curves for @xmath96 yr @xcite and standard neutrino cooling ; similar @xmath2 distributions are obtained with nonstandard cooling @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : roeglitch ] , we plot as points the maximum @xmath3 in @xmath97 glitching pulsars with @xmath96 yr , taken from table 1 in @xcite , assuming conservatively that @xmath3 is less than the fractional frequency jump of the largest glitch . for each object , @xmath2 is estimated by the method in the previous paragraph .",
    "we also plot two @xmath46 ( @xmath2 ) curves : the hvbk scaling computed in  [ sec : hydro ] ( @xmath98 , solid curve ) and a scaling extrapolated from the study by @xcite for @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 , dashed curve ) .",
    "the viscous fluid scaling lies in the middle of the cluster of points , while the hvbk superfluid scaling lies above all the points .",
    "this suggests two possible conclusions : ( i ) a glitching pulsar must have @xmath102 , otherwise stewartson layer instabilities would erase the shear required for the glitch phenomenon to occur ; and ( ii ) it is important to include the hvbk superfluid dynamics to ensure that all points in figure [ fig : roeglitch ] lie below the @xmath103 curve , given that no discernible difference is observed in the glitch behaviour of objects above and below the viscous fluid scaling .    in the superfluid stewartson layer",
    ", there is an extra ingredient that influences the instability curve : the mutual friction between the normal and superfluid component , controlled by the dimensionless parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we have only considered the weak coupling regime in this investigation ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) . in the strong coupling regime [ @xmath106 , @xmath107 @xcite ]",
    "the instabilities are likely to be quite different .",
    "preliminary results for axisymmetric steady states show that the stewartson layer is @xmath87 % thicker .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the effect of mutual friction and entrainment on @xmath103 will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the results in  [ sec : hydro ] and  [ sec : unstable ] demonstrate that stewartson layers develop in rotating hvbk superfluids , like the @xmath34-paired neutron superfluid in the outer core of a neutron star .",
    "we present the first numerical simulation of a hvbk stewartson layer , for ekman and rossby numbers in the ranges @xmath62 and @xmath108 .",
    "superfluid stewartson layers are unstable to nonaxisymmetric perturbations",
    ". transitions between unstable stewartson modes in the superfluid are different to those found in a viscous fluid , and the critical rossby number @xmath103 is @xmath87 times higher in the above parameter regime . in glitching pulsars , one finds @xmath102 in the 55 pulsars for which @xmath3 and @xmath2 can be estimated reliably from observations .",
    "one possible interpretation of these data is that the stewartson layer remains stable in these objects , allowing rotational shear to build up ( as required for glitches ) without triggering disruption of the stewartson layer [ which would nullify the shear @xcite and hence shut down the glitching behaviour ] .",
    "the threshold @xmath103 can be compared against the upper limit derived independently from the gravitational - wave spin down caused by kolmogorov - like superfluid turbulence excited in the stellar interior @xcite .",
    "the conclusions drawn from the data in figure [ fig : roeglitch ] extend and partially clarify the surprising empirical finding , that the @xmath2 distribution is markedly different between glitchers and nonglitchers @xcite .",
    "it seems strange that stars with @xmath109 ( few glitches ) and @xmath110 ( many glitches ) behave so differently , since in both regimes kolmogorov turbulence must be fully developed and scale - free .",
    "however , from figure [ fig : roeglitch ] [ and figure 4 in @xcite ] one sees that small differences in @xmath2 and @xmath3 lead to very different flow states and stability properties @xcite .",
    "moreover , if theoretical estimates of effective viscosity and hence @xmath2 are too low by a factor @xmath111 , due to turbulent reynolds stresses @xcite , glitching pulsars lie in a range where ( i ) the most interesting flow transitions occur before the flow becomes turbulent ( i.e. at @xmath112 for @xmath113 ) , and ( ii ) numerical simulations are computationally tractable .",
    "the results of this paper _ do not _ prove that stewartson flow transitions control glitch behaviour .",
    "we merely find empirically that all observed glitchers lie on the stable side of the @xmath103 threshold for nonaxisymmetric instabilities of a stewartson layer in a hvbk superfluid .",
    "recently , a hydrodynamic trigger for pulsar glitches was proposed by @xcite , associated with r - modes excited by differential rotation",
    ". it would be interesting to see how meridionally circulating stewartson base states modify these calculations , especially in the strong pinning scenario ( for which @xmath114 , @xmath106 ) .",
    "@xcite found empirical evidence of departures from solid - body rotation in a radio pulsar .",
    "we do not consider stratification or magnetic fields in this investigation .",
    "in viscous fluids , strong stratification supresses the stewartson layer , leaving a taylor column parallel to the rotation axis @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields widen the stewartson layer , merging it with the interior flow @xcite .",
    "this difficult physics deserves investigation .",
    "we acknowledge the support of the max - planck society ( albert - einstein institut ) and the computer time supplied by the victorian partnership for advanced computation .",
    "we thank rainer hollerbach for indicating the importance of the stewartson layer and very illuminating discussions .",
