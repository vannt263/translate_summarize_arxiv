    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has a rich phase structure as a function of temperature @xmath3 , quark chemical potential @xmath1 , and quark mass @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "determination of it , in particular the location of the transition between the confined phase at low @xmath3 and @xmath1 and the deconfined phase at high @xmath3 , plays important roles in a study of early evolutions in the universe . from lattice",
    "qcd simulations , the transition is considered to be an analytic crossover at low @xmath1 around the physical point of quark masses but is expected to turn into a first - order transition when we increase @xmath1 or vary the quark masses .",
    "identification of the critical point where the crossover turns into the first - order transition is also important in understanding the nature of the quark matter created in high - energy heavy - ion collision experiments @xcite .",
    "when we increase @xmath1 in a lattice simulation of qcd , the sign problem becomes severe .",
    "an extremely high statistics is required to obtain statistically significant results from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations when @xmath1 is not small enough .",
    "we need to combine various techniques developed at small @xmath1 to extend the range of calculability toward larger @xmath1 .",
    "one of the goals of these studies is to find a decisive evidence of the first - order transition by a mc study to locate the critical point .    to achieve this goal",
    ", we are developing a histogram method in which histograms are used to identify a first - order signal @xcite .",
    "our histogram method can be viewed as a variant of the spectral density methods @xcite .",
    "when the transition is of first order , we expect multiple peaks in the histogram for observables that are sensitive to the phase , such as the energy density and chiral order parameter .",
    "we can thus detect the on - set of a first - order transition through a deformation of the histogram . to do this , however , we need statistically reliable data on the histogram over a wide range of expectation values . with a single mc simulation , a correct evaluation of a multiple - peak histogram at a first - order transition point",
    "requires many flip - flops among different phases , that is computationally demanding with dynamical quarks .",
    "this problem is remedied by introducing the reweighting technique @xcite , with which we can combine simulations at different points in the parameter space , and thus with slightly different support of expectation values , to obtain a reliable histogram over a wide range of expectation values @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we adopted the histogram method to investigate the quark mass dependence of the qcd phase transition in the heavy quark region at @xmath5 and have shown that the histogram method is powerful in determining the phase structure : combining a mc simulation in the heavy quark limit of qcd [ su(3 ) yang - mills theory ] and the hopping parameter expansion , the first - order deconfining transition of qcd in the heavy quark limit is shown to become weaker when we decrease the quark mass from infinity .",
    "the location of the critical point where the first - order transition turns into a crossover @xcite was computed using various observables . extending the results to the case of @xmath0 flavor qcd",
    ", we thus determined the critical line separating the first order and crossover regions around the top - right corner of the columbia plot @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "we introduce chemical potential @xmath1 to the study of heavy quark qcd . the critical line in @xmath0",
    "flavor qcd becomes a critical surface in the parameter space including @xmath1 .",
    "although the critical surface in the heavy - quark region is different from that in the light - quark region@xcite and thus is not directly relevant to the transition in the real world , the former provides us with a good testing ground of the method , since the computational burden is much lighter . we show that , to the leading order of the hopping parameter expansion , the complex phase of the quark determinant is introduced though the imaginary part of the polyakov line . by studying an effective potential of the polyakov line , we find that the @xmath1-dependence of the critical surface is simple in the phase - quenched theory .",
    "we then take account of the effects of the complex phase by estimating the phase average using the cumulant expansion method @xcite to determine the critical surface in @xmath0 flavor qcd at finite density .",
