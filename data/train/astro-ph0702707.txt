    "the rossiter  mclaughlin effect ( hereafter the rm effect ) is a phenomenon originally reported as a `` rotational effect '' in eclipsing binary systems by @xcite ( for the beta lyrae system ) and @xcite ( for the algol system ) . in the context of extrasolar planetary science ,",
    "the rm effect is seen as a radial velocity anomaly during a planetary transit caused by the partial occultation of the rotating stellar disk ( see @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , for theoretical descriptions ) .",
    "the radial velocity anomaly depends on the trajectory of the planet across the disk of the host star , and in particular on the alignment between that trajectory and the rotation field of the star . by monitoring this anomaly throughout a transit",
    "one can determine whether or not the planetary orbital axis is well - aligned with the stellar spin axis .",
    "in the solar system , the orbits of all 8 planets are known to be well - aligned with the solar equator , but this is not necessarily the case for exoplanetary systems , or for hot jupiters in particular .",
    "the key parameter is the sky - projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis , @xmath1 , and measurements of this `` misalignment angle '' for various exoplanetary systems will help to place the solar system in a broader context .",
    "specifically , measurements of the rm effect for exoplanetary systems are important because of the implications for theories of migration and hot jupiter formation .",
    "so far , measurements of @xmath1 for two systems have been reported ; and @xcite for hd  209458 , @xcite for hd  189733 . in both of those systems ,",
    "the host star is very bright ( @xmath8 ) , facilitating the measurement .",
    "the observed values of @xmath1 for the two systems are small or consistent with zero , which would imply that the standard migration mechanism ( planet - disk interaction ) does not alter the spin - orbit alignment grossly during the planetary formation epoch .",
    "however , just these few examples are not enough for statistical constraints on other hot jupiter formation theories , including planet - planet interaction @xcite , the `` jumping jupiter '' model @xcite , or the kozai mechanism @xcite , which may lead hot jupiters to have significantly misaligned orbits",
    ". thus further measurements of the rm effect for other transiting systems are valuable . given that most of ongoing transit surveys target relatively faint ( @xmath2 ) host stars , it is also important to extend the reach of this technique to fainter stars .",
    "further observations for new targets would be useful to constrain planet formation theories , and more importantly , have a potential to discover large spin - orbit misalignments , which would be a challenge to some theoretical models .    in this paper , we report the measurement of the rm effect and the constraint on @xmath1 for tres-1 ( @xmath9 ) which has a significantly fainter host star than those in previous studies ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in addition to the fainter host star , this work differs from previous studies of the rm effect in that we have conducted simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations .",
    "this new strategy offers several potentially important advantages .",
    "first , the simultaneous photometry eliminates any uncertainty in the results due to the orbital ephemeris and the transit depth .",
    "although this did not turn out to be crucial for the present work , it will be useful for newly discovered targets which still have uncertainty in the times of transits .",
    "second , the transit depth might be expected to vary due to star spots or transient events , and indeed evidence for star spots was reported in hst / acs photometry for this system @xcite .",
    "thus simultaneous monitoring is useful to assess anomalies in the transit depth .",
    "finally , obtaining all of the data on a single night is useful to avoid systematic errors in radial velocities from long - term instrumental instabilities .",
    "moreover , although it need not be simultaneous , the photometry also helps to determine the limb - darkening parameter for the visual band , which can be used in the interpretation of the rm - affected spectra . in this way , we can determine the limb - darkening parameter of the host star directly from the data , instead of assuming a value based on stellar atmosphere models .",
    "we describe our observations in section 2 and report the results in section 3 .",
    "section 4 provides a discussion and summary of this paper .",
    "we observed the planet - hosting k0v star tres-1 on ut 2006 june 21 , the night of a predicted planetary transit , using the subaru 8.2  m telescope at mauna kea and the magnum 2  m telescope at haleakala , both in hawaii .",
    "the event is predicted as the 238th transit from the first discovery , namely @xmath10 ( @xmath11 : integer ) in the ephemeris by @xcite ; @xmath12.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the transit occurred shortly after midnight .",
    "we observed tres-1 during 5 hours bracketing the predicted transit time , through air masses ranging from 1.0 to 1.3 .",
    "the magnum 2  m telescope is located near the haleakala summit on the hawaiian island of maui @xcite .",
    "the magnum photometric observation was conducted in parallel with the subaru spectroscopic observation .",
    "we employed the multi - color imaging photometer ( mip ) using a @xmath13 pixel ccd with a @xmath14 band filter , covering 4750  @xmath15 6180   , and we set 9 dithering positions ( 3@xmath16 positions ) on the ccd .",
    "the mip has a @xmath17 arcmin@xmath18 field of view ( fov ) with a pixel scale of 0.277 arcsec / pixel .",
    "we used 2mass j19041058 + 3638409 as our comparison star for differential photometry .",
    "this star is close enough to fit in the mip field of view , and is known to be photometrically stable at a level sufficient for our study ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the exposure time was either 40 or 60 seconds according to observing conditions so that the photon counts are close to the saturation level of the ccd , with a readout / setup time of 60 seconds .",
    "we then reduced the images with the standard mip pipeline described in @xcite .",
    "we determined the apparent magnitudes of tres-1 and the comparison star using an aperture radius of 20 pixels .",
    "the typical fwhm of each star ranged from 1.4 to 1.9 arcsec ( from 5 to 7 pixels ) .",
    "we estimated the sky background level with an annulus from 20 to 25 pixels in radius centered on each star , and subtracted the estimated sky contribution from the aperture flux .",
    "then we computed the differential magnitude between tres-1 and the comparison star .",
    "after these steps , we decorrelated the differential magnitude from the dithering positions and eliminated apparent outliers from the light curve , most of which were obtained at the 9th dithering position .",
    "we do not find any clear correlations with other observing parameters .    for the analysis of transit photometry",
    ", @xcite studied the time - correlated noise ( the so - called `` red noise '' ) in detail , and introduced a simple and useful method to account at least approximately for the effect of the red noise on parameter estimation . based on these studies , we used the following procedure to determine the appropriate data weights for the magnum photometry ( which are similar to that employed by @xcite ) .",
    "we first fitted the magnum light curve with the analytic formula given in @xcite and found the residuals between the data and the best - fitting model . using only the poisson noise as an estimate of the error in each photometric sample , we found @xmath19 ( @xmath20 : degrees of freedom ) , implying that the true errors are significantly in excess of the poisson noise .",
    "we also found the residuals in the early part of the night ( before @xmath21 [ hjd ] ) to be significantly larger than those from later in the night .",
    "this larger scatter could have been caused by shaking of the telescope by the stronger winds that occurred during the early part of the night .",
    "we thus estimated error - bars separately for the early part of the night and the later part of the night , as described below .",
    "first , we rescaled the error bars to satisfy @xmath22 ( step 1 ) , namely 0.00259 for the early data and",
    "0.00189 for the late data .",
    "the light curve with these rescaled error bars is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ ourdata ] .",
    "next , in order to assess the size of time - correlated noise for the magnum data , we solved the following equations , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the standard deviation of each residual and @xmath25 is the standard deviation of the average of the successive @xmath26 points .",
    "@xmath27 is called the white noise , which is uncorrelated noise that averages down as @xmath28 , while @xmath29 is called the red noise , which represents correlated noise that remains constant for specified @xmath26 .",
    "we calculated @xmath27 and @xmath29 for the choice @xmath30 ( corresponding to one hour ) , finding @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the early data . on the other hand",
    ", we found @xmath33 ( suggesting a smaller level of the red noise ) for the late data .",
    "the choice of @xmath30 is fairly arbitrary ; other choices of @xmath26 between 5 and 50 gave similar results .",
    "we then adjusted the error bars for the early night by multiplying @xmath34^{1/2 } \\sim 3.6 $ ] ( step 2 ) .",
    "we did not change the error bars for the late night data .",

    "( 2 ) in @xcite ) . note that we adopt @xmath168 [ @xmath169 which is determined by this work .",
    "we find @xmath170 [ @xmath6 ] ( circular ) and @xmath172 [ @xmath6 ] ( eccentric ) . as a result",
    ", we exclude the trojan companions near the l4 point more massive than @xmath173 [ @xmath6 ] if the orbit is circular , and @xmath174 [ @xmath6 ] if the orbit is allowed to be eccentric , both at the 3@xmath7 level .",
    "our constraint under the reasonable assumption of a circular orbit is more stringent than that of @xcite by a factor of 4 , because we have increased the number of radial velocity samples and because our data cover the critical phase to determine @xmath154 .",
    "consequently , we conclude that we do not find any sign of the existence of additional bodies in the tres-1 system at present .    in this paper",
    ", we have placed a constraint on the sky - projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis for the tres-1 system , namely @xmath0 [ deg ] using all available data and information from previous studies .",
    "although we can not discriminate whether the spin - orbit angle in this system is well - aligned or not at this point , our constraint on @xmath1 clearly indicates the prograde orbital motion of tres-1b . the uncertainty is larger than in previous studies ( @xmath175 [ deg ] for hd  209458 and hd  189733 ) because the host star is significantly fainter in this case .",
    "although further radial velocity measurements during transit would be necessary to pin down @xmath1 more stringently , we have demonstrated for the first time that such measurements are possible for such a faint target .",
    "this is important because most of the newly discovered transiting planets from ongoing transit surveys will have relatively faint host stars .",
    "for example , the new targets that were discovered in 2006 , namely xo-1 @xcite , tres-2 @xcite , hat - p-1 @xcite , wasp-1 and wasp-2 @xcite , are all in this category . combining future measurements of @xmath1 in other transiting systems",
    ", we would be able to determine the distribution of @xmath1 for exoplanetary systems with useful statistical accuracy .",
