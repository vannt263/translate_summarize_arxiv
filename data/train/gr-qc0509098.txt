    "the first binary radio pulsar ( psr b 1913 + 16 ) was discovered some 30 years ago by taylor and hulse@xcite .",
    "since those years , a great amount of work has been done , and pulsars in binary systems have proved to be celestial laboratories for testing the relativistic theories of gravity ( see @xcite and references therein ) . indeed , up to the present day , einstein s theory of gravity , general relativity ( gr ) , has passed all observational tests with excellent results .",
    "however , even if the aim of the experimental relativists is always to achieve a greater precision , we must not forget that most of the tests of gr come from solar system experiments , where the gravitational field is in the `` weak '' regime . on the other hand",
    ", it is expected that deviations from gr can occur for the first time in the `` strong '' field regime : hence , the solar system experiments are inadequate to this end . on the contrary ,",
    "the strong gravitational field is best tested by means of pulsars .",
    "pulsars , which are highly magnetized rotating neutron stars , are important both for testing relativistic theories of gravity and for studying the interstellar medium , stars , binary systems and their evolution , plasma physics in extreme conditions . as for the tests of gravity ,",
    "the recent discovery of the first double pulsar psr j0737 - 3039 burgay03,@xcite provided an astonishing quantity of data , which make this system a rare relativistic laboratory @xcite .",
    "as we pointed out elsewhere @xcite , this system in particular , and binary pulsars systems in general , could be useful for testing the so called gravito - magnetic effects .",
    "these effects are originated by the rotation of the sources of the gravitational field , which gives rise to the presence of off - diagonal @xmath0 terms in the metric tensor .",
    "the gravitational coupling with the angular momentum of the source is indeed much weaker than the coupling with mass alone , the so called gravito - electric interaction .",
    "in fact , the ratio between the former and the latter can be estimated to be of the order of @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the schwarzschild radius of the source , @xmath3 being its mass , and @xmath4 ( the absolute value of ) its angular momentum . at the surface of the sun , which is the most favorable place in the solar system , evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ rapporto ] ) gives @xmath5 , thus evidencing the weakness of the gravito - magnetic versus the gravito - electric interaction .",
    "the smallness of @xmath6 is the reason why , though having been suggested from the very beginning of the relativistic age  lense , the experimental verification of the existence of gravito - magnetic effects has been very difficult until today ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the relevance of pulsar systems for the detection of the gravito - magnetic effects lays in the fact that the ratio  ( [ rapporto ] ) can be less unfavorable whenever @xmath7 is approaching the schwarzschild radius of the source : this can be the case of a source of electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "signals orbiting around a compact , collapsed object .    as for the rotation effects in pulsars binary systems , in general , the coupling of the intrinsic angular momentum of the stars with the orbital angular momentum , and the coupling of the intrinsic angular momenta of the two stars themselves were studied , together with the corresponding precession effects @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , weisberg02,@xcite .",
    "the gravitomagnetic effects on the propagation of light in a binary system were studied by kopeikin and mashhoon ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we studied the effects of the gravitational field on e.m .",
    "pulses propagating in a binary system , and we emphasized the gravito - magnetic contribution . in doing that , we used a simplified model which considered circular orbits only . here",
    "we generalize those results , by taking into account orbits with arbitrary eccentricity , which is a more realistic approach on the basis of the knowledge of binary systems discovered until today .",
    "in particular , we study the gravito - magnetic correction to the shapiro contribution to the time of flight of the signals , focusing on its effect on the arrival times perceived by the experimenter on the earth , and we introduce a new post - keplerian parameter which is related to the intrinsic angular momentum of the stars .",
    "finally , we evaluate the magnitude of these effects for the binary pulsar systems known so far .",
    "when studying pulsars , what is measured are the pulse arrival times at the ( radio ) telescope over a suitably long period of time .",
    "in fact , even though individual pulses are generally weak and have an irregular profile , a regular mean profile is obtained by averaging the received pulses over a long time .",
    "pulses traveling to the earth are delayed because of the dispersion caused by the interstellar medium . besides this delay ,",
    "other gravitational factors influence the arrival times of the signals emitted by a pulsar in a binary system : the strong field in the vicinity of the pulsar , the relatively weak field between the two compact objects forming the binary system and , finally , the weak field of the solar system .",
    "consequently , the arrival time @xmath8 of the @xmath9th pulse , as measured on the earth , depends on a set of parameters @xmath10 , which include a description of the orbit of the binary system : @xmath11 in particular , the set @xmath10 includes the keplerian parameters , together with the so called `` post - keplerian '' ( pk ) parameters which describe the relativistic corrections to the keplerian orbit of the system . since",
    "seven parameters are needed to completely describe the dynamics of the binary system ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the measurement of any two pk parameters , besides the five keplerian ones , allows to predict the remaining pk parameters .",
    "for instance , if the two masses are the only free parameters , the measurement of three or more pk parameters over - constrains the system and introduces theory - dependent lines in a mass - mass diagram that should intersect , in principle , in a single point @xcite .",
    "this is of course true as far as the intrinsic angular momenta are not taken into account .",
    "it is possible to obtain a relation which links the time of arrival of a pulse on the earth to its time of emission .",
    "more in detail , the following timing formula holds , which relates the reception ( topocentric ) time @xmath12 on the earth with the emission time @xmath13 in the comoving pulsar frame @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a reference epoch , @xmath16 is the dispersive delay ( as a function of the frequency of the pulses , @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 are , respectively the roemer delay , the einstein delay and the shapiro delay due to the gravitational field of the binary system ( while @xmath19 are the corresponding terms due to the solar system field ) and @xmath20 is the delay due to aberration",
    ".    here we are concerned with the gravito - magnetic corrections due to the intrinsic angular momentum of the stars to the shapiro delay @xmath21 , which we analyze in the following section .",
    "we want to calculate the relation between the coordinate emission time @xmath22 and the coordinate arrival time @xmath23 ( as measured at the solar system center of mass ) .    to this end",
    ", we consider a reference frame at rest in the center of mass of the binary system . in this reference frame , the vector pointing to the pulsar emitting e.m",
    ". signals is @xmath24 , while the one pointing to its companion star is @xmath25 ; in the following , the suffix `` 1 '' will always refer to the pulsar , and `` 2 '' to its companion .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 , is the position of the center of mass of the solar system .",
    "we use the notation of figure [ fig : fig1 ] for the description of the pulsar orbit .",
    "we choose a first set of cartesian coordinates @xmath27 , with origin in the center of mass of the binary system , and such that the line of sight is parallel to the @xmath28 axis .",
    "then , we introduce another set of cartesian coordinates @xmath29 , with the same origin : the @xmath30 axis is directed along the ascending node , the @xmath31 axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "the angle between the @xmath32 and @xmath30 axes is @xmath33 , the longitude of the ascending node , while the angle between the @xmath28 and @xmath31 axes is @xmath34 , the inclination of the orbital plane .",
    "let @xmath35 be the orbit of the pulsar : it is described by @xmath36 in terms of the argument of the periastron , @xmath37 , and the true anomaly , @xmath38 .",
    "let us pose @xmath39 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "then , we use the notation @xmath40 to describe the position of the pulsar with respect to its companion , and we remember that we have , for the keplerian problem @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the semi - major axis of the relative motion and @xmath43 is the eccentricity .",
    "the astronomical elements @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath37 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 represent the keplerian parameters . in what follows",
    ", we will use also the definitions @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "that being said , let us focus on the physical situation we are dealing with .",
    "if the gravito - magnetic effects are neglected , the metric describing the gravitational field of the binary system is given by ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 we see that the total gravitational potential is the sum of the two contributions , due to the pulsar , whose mass is @xmath49 , and to its companion , whose mass is @xmath50 . ] .",
    "starting from ( eq : ds1 ) , the mass contribution to the time delay can be evaluated following the standard approach , described , for instance , in straumann04 .",
    "however , we want to generalize this approach in order to take into account the effects of the rotation of the sources of the gravitational field , i.e. the gravito - magnetic effects .",
    "to this end , we may guess that the metric , in the coordinates @xmath51 , assumes the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the ( total ) gravito - magnetic vector potential of the system .",
    "( [ eq : ds3 ] ) generalizes the weak field metric around a rotating source ( see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we suppose that the dominant contribution to the total gravito - magnetic potential is due to the intrinsic angular momenta @xmath54 of the stars ; we suppose also that @xmath54 are aligned with the total orbital angular momentum @xmath55 , i.e. perpendicular to the orbital plane . furthermore ,",
    "since we assume that the signals emitted by pulsar 1 propagate along a straight line , and because the gravito - magnetic coupling depends on the impact parameter , we may conclude that the only relevant gravito - magnetic contribution comes from the companion star 2 .",
    "consequently , the metric ( [ eq : ds3 ] ) becomes @xmath56    in ( [ eq : ds4 ] ) @xmath57 varies along the straight line defined by @xmath58 if we set @xmath59 then @xmath60 when @xmath61 , and @xmath62 when @xmath63 .",
    "consequently , we may write @xmath64 after some straightforward manipulations , the line element ( [ eq : ds4 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath65 where @xmath66    by setting @xmath67 , we easily see that the propagation time is made of three contributions , up to first order in the masses of the stars , and in the spin angular momentum : @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 + let us comment on ( [ eq : tzero1])-([eq : tj1 ] ) : the first contribution is a purely geometric one , and is due to the propagation , in flat space , of e.m .",
    "signals from the pulsar toward the solar system .",
    "the second contribution represents the time depending part of the total shapiro delay . as such",
    "it is entirely due to the mass of the companion star ; in fact it is easy to verify that the term containing the mass of the pulsar emitting e.m .",
    "signals gives a contribution which remains constant during the orbital motion .",
    "finally , the third contribution is due to the gravito - magnetic field of the companion star .",
    "to lowest order , we obtain @xmath72 @xmath73   \\label{eq : tm2}\\ ] ] @xmath74 the contributions ( [ eq : tzero2 ] ) and ( [ eq : tm2 ] ) to the time delay are in agreement with the standard results ( see @xcite ) , while equation ( [ eq : tj2 ] ) gives the gravito - magnetic corrections .    from the time delay ( [ eq : tm2 ] ) we may extract the contribution which varies during the orbital motion ; if we use the equation of the orbit ( [ eq : orbita1 ] ) it can be written in the form @xmath75 .",
    "\\label{eq : dsm7}\\ ] ]    if we introduce the pk shapiro parameters @xmath76 the mass ( or , gravito - electric ) contribution to the time delay becomes @xmath77 .",
    "\\label{eq : dsm8}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , the gravito - magnetic contribution ( eq : tj2 ) changes continuously during the orbital motion , so that , similarly , we may write @xmath78 .   \\label{eq : dsj3}\\ ] ] if we introduce the pk parameter @xmath79 , and define a new pk parameter @xmath80 the gravito - magnetic contribution to the shapiro time delay can be written in the form @xmath81 .",
    "\\label{eq : dsj4}\\ ] ] we notice that the new pk parameter @xmath82 coincides with the intrinsic angular momentum of the source of the gravito - magnetic field . in particular , if we knew the rotation frequency of the source of the gravito - magnetic field ( which is possible , if the latter is a visible pulsar , for instance ) , the new pk parameter could give information on its moment of inertia .",
    "the gravito - electric and gravito - magnetic contributions to the time delay ( [ eq : dsm8 ] ) and ( [ eq : dsj4 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath83where we have introduced the following constant `` amplitudes '' @xmath84and the varying `` phase '' terms @xmath85 ,   \\label{eq : afm3 } \\\\",
    "f_{j}(\\varphi ) & \\doteq & \\frac{\\left ( \\cos ( \\omega + \\varphi ) \\right ) \\left ( 1+e\\cos \\varphi \\right ) } { 1-\\mathcal{s}\\sin ( \\omega + \\varphi ) } .",
    "\\label{eq : afj3}\\end{aligned}\\]]in particular we see that when @xmath86 , @xmath87 tends to diverge as far as @xmath88 ( i.e. close to the conjunction position , when the impact parameter goes to zero ) .",
    "@xmath89 too diverges in the same configuration and we see that the divergences have different `` strength '' , the former being an inverse power , the latter logarithmic .",
    "the reason for that difference is easily referable to the gravito - magnetic potential affecting @xmath90 , which has a dipolar structure , and to the monopolar gravito - electric one affecting @xmath89 .    even though the divergences have no physical meaning because the actual compact objects have finite dimensions and the e.m .",
    "signals can not pass through the center of the companion star , we see that the gravito - magnetic contribution is bigger for those systems that are seen nearly edge - on from the earth , which are the ideal candidates for revealing the gravito - magnetic effects . this is the case , for instance , of the binary system psr j0737 - 3039 , where , however , unfortunately the presence of a large magnetosheath zone makes the effective impact parameter much bigger than the actual linear dimension of a neutron star tartaglia05 .",
    "that being said , in the following section we give numerical estimates for the constant amplitudes @xmath91 and @xmath92 for the known binary pulsar systems .",
    "the pk parameters related to the shapiro time delay @xmath93 have been successfully measured with great accuracy in some binary pulsar systems , such as psr b 1913 + 16 ( see @xcite , taylor89 ) , and the recently discovered system psr j0737 - 3039 ( see burgay03,@xcite,@xcite ) . indeed , the analysis of these systems is very accurate , because of their favorable geometrical properties and , through the measurements of several pk parameters , they provided very accurate tests of gr as confronted to alternative theories of gravity . in @xcite",
    ", we studied the gravito - magnetic corrections to pulsar timing in a simplified situation , taking into account circular orbits only . here",
    ", since we have generalized those results to arbitrary elliptic orbits , we may apply the formalism developed so far to all the binary pulsar systems known up to this moment , in order to estimate the magnitude of the gravito - magnetic corrections to the time delay . in table",
    "[ tab : table1 ] @xmath94 and @xmath92 are evaluated for the binary systems known until today , @xmath95 . ] . a few comments on how the table has been obtained : for those systems where the available data are not complete , we have chosen for the missing data the most favorable value ( see the caption of the table ) .",
    "furthermore , we have estimated the intrinsic angular momentum of the sources of the gravitational field supposing that the progenitor star was only a little bigger than the sun , and that most of the angular momentum was preserved during the collapse , so that @xmath96 .    from table [",
    "tab : table1 ] it is clear that the gravito - magnetic contribution is much smaller than the mass contribution , as expected .",
    "however it is possible , at least in principle , to distinguish the former from the latter , on the basis of their different dependance from the geometric parameters .",
    "in fact , from ( [ eq : tzero2]),([eq : dsm8 ] ) and ( [ eq : dsj4 ] ) it is clear that the geometric and the gravito - electric contribution are symmetric with respect to the conjunction and opposition points , while the gravito - magnetic contribution is anti - symmetric .",
    "as we pointed out in the previous paper @xcite , if it were possible to identify conjunction and opposition points in the sequence of arriving pulses , this fact could be exploited for extracting the gravito - magnetic effect .",
    "nowadays , the uncertainties in pulsar data timing are of the order of @xmath97 ( see for instance @xcite ) . however , as we pointed out above , gravito - magnetic effects can become larger if the geometry of the system is favorable : in particular , when @xmath98 , @xmath90 tends to diverge close to the conjunction . on the other hand , we can give an estimate of the value of the geometrical parameters needed to make @xmath92 of the order of magnitude of the present day uncertainties .",
    "so , if we assume @xmath96 , in order to have @xmath99 , we must have @xmath100hence , small orbits with great eccentricity allow , at least in principle , the measurement of the gravito - magnetic effects .",
    "it might be useful , also , to estimate the rate of decay of the orbit because of the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "if we assume , for the sake of simplicity , @xmath101 and that @xmath42 fulfills ( [ eq : estim1 ] ) , we get ( see @xcite ) @xmath102consequently , we may argue that these effects may become larger in the final phase of the evolution of the binary systems , i.e. during their coalescence , even though , in that phase , the weak field approach that we used in this paper would probably be rather poordemanding for different analysis techniques .",
    "the smallness of the gravito - magnetic delay would also require long data taking times so posing the problem of the stability of the pulsar frequency .",
    "however a peculiarity which is not blurred by any drift or noise is the physical antisymmetry of the gravito - magnetic effect , which should emerge in the long period over all other phenomena .",
    ".evaluation of the gravito - electric and gravito - magnetic contributions to the time delay . for the systems psr j1756 - 2251,psr j1829 + 2456 , psr j1518 + 4904 , psr j1811 - 1736 , psr b2127 + 11c , since the present data do not provide the inclination of the orbit , we chose the most favorable value for the calculations of @xmath103 , i.e. @xmath98 . similarly , for the calculations of @xmath104 , we chose the best estimate for the mass of the companion star for the systems psr j1829 + 2456 , psr j1518 + 4904 , psr j1811 - 1736 , since the available data do not constrain it completely . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +",
    "in this paper , we have studied the effects of the gravitational interaction on the time delay of electromagnetic signals coming from a binary system composed of a radio - pulsar and another compact object . in particular , we have focused our attention on the gravito - magnetic corrections to the time delay due to the gravitational field of the binary system ( shapiro time delay).in doing so , we have generalized the results obtained in a previous paper , where we considered a simplified situation , taking into account circular orbits only . here",
    "arbitrary elliptic orbits are allowed . furthermore , by following a standard approach , we have expressed the time delay and its gravito - magnetic component in terms of keplerian and post - keplerian parameters.in particular , a new post - keplerian parameter has been introduced , which coincides with the intrinsic angular momentum of the source of the gravitational field , and could give , in some cases , information on its moment of inertia.we have given numerical estimates of the amount of the gravito - magnetic corrections for all binary pulsar systems known until today , and we have seen that , even though they are usually much smaller than the corresponding gravito - electric ones , they can become larger for those systems that are seen nearly edge - on from the earth , which are the ideal candidates for revealing the gravito - magnetic effects in this context.among the known binary pulsar systems , the one having the most favorable geometrical properties for the detection of the gravito - magnetic effect is psr j0737 - 3039 , which , unfortunately , has a large magnetosheath that keeps the magnitude of the gravito - magnetic correction below the detectability threshold .",
    "however , we can not exclude , at the present discovery rate of new binary pulsars , that other binary systems with favorable geometrical configurations can be found .",
    "this fact , together with the expected improvement of the sensitivity and precision of the timing of pulses , makes us cherish the hope that , in the future , it will be possible to measure the gravito - magnetic corrections to the time delay , and in particular the newly introduced post - keplerian parameter .",
