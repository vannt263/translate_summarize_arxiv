    "_ fermi _ was launched from cape canaveral on the 11th of june 2008 .",
    "it is currently in an almost circular orbit around the earth at an altitude of 565  km having an inclination of 25.6@xmath2 and an orbital period of 96 minutes .",
    "after an initial activation period and on - orbit calibration @xcite , the observatory was put into a sky - survey mode .",
    "the observatory has two instruments onboard , the large area telescope@xcite ( lat ) , a pair - conversion gamma - ray detector with a tracker and calorimeter , and a gamma ray burst monitor ( gbm ) that is dedicated to the detection of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the two instruments on _ fermi _ provide coverage over the energy range from a few kev to several hundreds gev .            here",
    "we report the detection and measurements of gamma - ray emission from the moon resulting from cosmic - ray interactions with moon .",
    "the @xmath3-rays results from decays of neutral pions and kaons .",
    "cosmic - ray interaction with the lunar surface is well established and the gamma - ray spectrum has been computed @xcite ; more recent calculations have been performed using a detailed description of the regolite lunar surface @xcite and geant4@xcite taking into account all the interactions with the specific composition of the lunar rock ( @xcite ) .",
    "these calculations indicate that the kinematics of the collisions of cosmic rays hitting the lunar surface , produce a secondary particle cascade that develops deep in the rock .",
    "a small fraction of the secondary pions that are low energy are directed toward to lunar surface and decay to produce a soft @xmath3-ray spectrum .",
    "moreover the same work indicates that the lunar gamma - ray spectrum should exhibit a narrow 67.5 mev line due to neutral pions decaying at rest and a steep spectrum . finally since",
    "the high energy @xmath3-rays can be produced by cosmic rays hitting the lunar surface with almost tangential traiectories , the limb of the disk surface should give the larger contribution to the emission .",
    "the discovery of @xmath3-ray emission from the moon was made during early analysis of egret data @xcite and provided a measurement of the gamma - ray spectra from cosmic - ray interactions with the lunar surface .",
    "they found an integral flux f(e@xmath1100",
    "mev)=@xmath4 ; this was confirmed in recent work@xcite .    with its large effective area the _",
    "fermi_-lat should be able to explore in detail the features of the lunar emission . in this paper",
    "we report first results from analysis of the first seven months of observations , updating previous fermi observations of lunar gamma - ray emission@xcite ; we also present preliminary measurements of observed fluxes .",
    "the data used in this study were collected from 4 august 2008 to the end of february 2009 ( 7months ) when the sun was at its minimum of activity .",
    "we have applied a zenith cut of 105@xmath5 to eliminate photons from the earth s limb .",
    "we used the `` diffuse '' class @xcite , corresponding to events with the highest probability of being true photons , for this analysis .",
    "we also used science tools version v9r11 and irfs ( instrumental response functions ) version p6_v3 .",
    "the position of the moon has been computed using a jpl@xcite library interface and parallax corrections are taken into account .",
    "photon events for analysis were selected in a moving frame of 15 degree radius and centered on the istantaneous moon position .",
    "we used the unbinned likelihood analysis technique typically used for astrophysical sources but , because the moon move quickly across the sky , we had to take additional precautions to determine the emission spectrum . in order to avoid strong variations of background photons , we excluded time intervals when the moon was close to the galactic plane or bright sources .",
    "we therefore required that the moon was at least 30@xmath2 from the galactic plane i.e. @xmath6 , and we remove also any time intervals in which any individual bright object has an angular distance less than 5@xmath2 from the moon . as an additional test of our background rejection we repeated the analysis using a fake moon that followed the lunar trajectory but was shifted 30 degrees behind the true trajectory .",
    "the fake moon was therefore exposed to the same celestial sources as the true moon .",
    "fig .  [ moon - map ] shows the count map of photon events with e@xmath1  100  mev in offsets of celestial coordinates relative to the lunar position .",
    "emission from the moon is clearly visible and centered on the expected location in this relative coordinate frame .",
    "[ moon - ra ] shows the count map of the events with e@xmath1  100  mev and within a 15@xmath2 from the moon center projected onto right ascension while in fig.[moon - dec ] the events are projected onto declination .",
    "the coordinates are offsets in degrees of celestial coordinates relative to the moon position . in these figures",
    "the counts observed for the fake moon are superimposed and demonstrate the need to carefully consider the background before any lunar analysis can be performed .",
    "simulated data confirm that the observed shape is in agreement with a pointlike source and the calculated point spread funtions of the lat@xcite for the expected lunar gamma - ray spectrum . in a more detailed analysis of a one - year database",
    "we will perform more detailed analysis of the shape of emission to determine its true extent and whether we can discern evidence for the expected limb brightening .    to study the spectrum of the gamma - ray emission we have used the standard unbinned maximum - likelihood spectral estimator provided with the lat science tools gtlike .",
    "this preliminary analysis was performed by fitting the  fake  moon data to model the background and the moon data sample with either a simple power law or other functional forms like a log - parabola summed to the background model .",
    "the fitted values obtained using a simple power law give a good test - statistics value of 4320.3 ( defined as @xmath7 , being @xmath8 and @xmath9 the likelihood values when the source is considered or not ) and indicate a power law index of @xmath10 .",
    "as a result of these fits we estimate the observed flux as @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the error includes the estimation of overall systematic error of about 20@xmath13 for these measurements , due essentially to the uncertainties of the detector effective area and due to the inefficiencies in gamma - ray detection due to pile - up effects from near coincidences with cosmic rays in the lat detector .",
    "however since the expected spectrum@xcite should exhibit more complex features we plan to more extensively study the spectral shape when the statistical sample is larger and the instrument response below 100 mev is better determined .",
    "the gamma - ray emission from the moon discovered by egret has been confirmed by _",
    "fermi _ and agrees in intensity for emission models that take into account the level of solar modulation .",
    "our preliminary flux estimation for the lunar @xmath3-ray emission is @xmath14 with a spectral index of @xmath10 obtained by fitting a simple power law between 100  mev to 1  gev .",
    "we expect that with a larger sample of events available after accumulating data for one year , _ fermi _ should be able to explore the other features of the lunar spectrum , e.g. the @xmath15 peak and also spatial structure on the lunar disk .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include nasa and doe in the united states , cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs in france , asi and infn in italy , mext , kek , and jaxa in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the national space board in sweden . additional support from inaf in italy for science analysis during the operations phase is also gratefully acknowledged .",
