    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national lab was built to search for quark matter , or the so - called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . since its first run in 2000 ,",
    "a huge number of data have been accumulated and a comprehensive analysis of these data has been carried out . a variety of experimental facts from different aspects imply that the strongly coupled qgp has probably been produced in central au+au collisions at rhic . for recent reviews of qgp and summary of experimental data , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "central au+au collisions are characterized by the production of thousands of charged - particles in vacuum .",
    "the charged - particle density per unit rapidity or pseudorapidity @xmath5 or @xmath1 is one of the most important observables to measure for the signal of qgp , from which a lot of information about the hot and dense matter can be extracted @xcite .",
    "one can scale @xmath1 or @xmath5 by the number of participant nucleon pairs @xmath6 and observe its logarithmic increase with @xmath7 , which is regarded as an evidence of color glass condensate @xcite . from the rapidity / pseudorapidity density and the transverse energy per particle , one can determine via bjorken method the real density of the fireball which can provide one piece of evidence for the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the experimental data about the charged - particle rapidity density have been presented by the phobos collaboration @xcite , the phenix collaboration @xcite , and the brahms collaboration @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will use a quark combination model to study the rapidity / pseudorapidity density varied with the number of participants and the energy in full rapidity range .",
    "the quark combination picture is successful in describing many features of multi - particle production in hadronic collisions . in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic energies ,",
    "a lot of new features are found , e.g. the high ratio of @xmath8 at intermediate transverse momenta , which supports quark coalescence or recombination picture @xcite .",
    "the quark number scaling of the elliptic flow is also a manifestation of the quark coalescence or recombination @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will use a binary potential model for the constituent quark production and then let the constituent quarks combine into initial hadrons according to a quark combination rule .",
    "then we allow the resonances in the initial hadrons to further decay to final hadrons with the help of the event generator pythia 6.3 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a brief description of the model for constituent quark production and combination . in section iii ,",
    "we present our predictions for the rapidity / pseudorapidity densities varied with the number of participants in the full rapidity range at @xmath0 gev , the energy dependence of the @xmath1 distribution at various collision energies for central collisions , and the results for the rapidity densities @xmath9 and yields for charged pions and kaons in the central collisions at @xmath4 gev .",
    "the summary and discussions are in section iv .",
    "in this section we give a brief introduction of the quark production and combination model we use .",
    "the model was first proposed for high energy @xmath10 and @xmath11 collisions @xcite and recently extended to ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to the multi - parton systems in high energy @xmath10 annihilations @xcite .",
    "the quark production from vacuum is a very sophisticated non - perturbative process .",
    "the color glass condensate model is a semi - classical qcd effective theory for the quark production in heavy ion collisions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use a simple model for quark production which is of statistical nature without dynamic details .",
    "we determine the number of constituent quarks by the total effective energy for producing quarks from the vacuum excitation .",
    "the effective energy consists of the part for quark static masses and that for effective interquark potentials .",
    "consider a system of @xmath12 quarks and anti - quarks excited in vacuum , the number of light and strange quarks / anti - quarks follow the ratio @xmath13 with @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the strangeness suppression factor due to the heavier mass of strange quarks / anti - quarks .",
    "the average quark mass is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the light quark mass and @xmath18 the strange quark mass .",
    "we assume that the interaction is characterized by an inter - quark potential @xmath19 which takes a substantial fraction of total effective energy .",
    "the constituent quark number can be determined from the following energy equation , @xmath20 which gives the number of constituent quarks as @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 note that the quark number @xmath12 follows a specific distribution , so does the potential , we have taken their averages in the above equations . in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , we only included the two - body potential leading to a @xmath23 asymptotic behavior for @xmath12 at high energy if @xmath24 is constant .",
    "for a strong coupling system , it is possible that the @xmath25-body ( @xmath26 ) potential might be more important , and the asymptotic behavior then becomes @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath25 is large , @xmath12 more and more approaches a logarithmic increase with energy .",
    "the phobos experiments have shown that above sps energies , the total multiplicity per participant pair @xmath28 in central events scales with @xmath29 in the same way as @xmath10 collisions @xcite .",
    "this suggests a universal mechanism of particle production mainly controlled by the amount of effective energy available for particle production .",
    "based on this property we extend the above quark production model originally applied to @xmath10 annihilation and @xmath11 collisions to heavy ion collisions .",
    "the average quark number in nucleus - nucleus collisions can be written as @xmath30 \\langle{n_{\\rm part}}/2\\rangle,\\ ] ] where we have taken @xmath31 .",
    "note that the effective energy @xmath32 is equal to collision energy @xmath33 for light quark events in @xmath10 annihilation ( but @xmath34 for heavy quark events ) .",
    "here we have assumed that the colliding nuclei is fully stopped and all the colliding energy @xmath29 is used for particle production , which is reasonable for the central collisions due to the fully rescatterings of partons towards the local equilibrium .",
    "it is also consistent with the landau s space time evolution picture @xcite .",
    "note that the average number of quarks and antiquarks @xmath35 includes not only new produced quarks and antiquarks , but also some additional quarks left by the incident nuclei .      in this subsection",
    "we briefly summarize how quarks combine into hadrons in our model .",
    "different from many coalescence models which do not distinguish directly produced hadrons from final state hadrons , our quark combination model only describe the hadronization of initially produced hadrons including resonances .",
    "then all resonances are allowed to decay into final state hadrons . here",
    "we make use of the event generator pythia 6.3 @xcite to deal with resonance decays .",
    "the basic idea is to put @xmath12 quarks and anti - quarks line up in a one - dimensional order in phase space , e.g. in rapidity , and let them combine into initial hadrons one by one following a combination rule .",
    "see section ii of ref .",
    "@xcite for short description of such a rule .",
    "we note that it is very straightforward to define the combination in one dimensional phase space , but it is highly complicated to do it in two or three dimensional phase space @xcite . the flavor su(3 ) symmetry with strangeness suppression in the yields of initially produced hadrons is fulfilled in the model @xcite . using the model ,",
    "we have described most of multiplicity data for hadrons in electron - positron and proton - proton / anti - proton collisions @xcite . also we solved a difficulty facing other quark combination models in describing the tasso data for baryon - antibaryon correlation in electron - positron collisions @xcite .",
    "combined with the color flow picture @xcite , the model can describe the hadroniztion of multiparton states @xcite .",
    "we have extended the model to reproduce the recent rhic data for hadron multiplicity ratios , @xmath36 spectra @xcite and elliptic flows @xcite in central rapidity region .",

    "<S> rapidity / seudorapidity densities for charged particles and their centrality , rapidity and energy dependence in au+au collisions at rhic are studied in a quark combination model . using a gaussian - type rapidity distribution for constituent quarks as a result of landau hydrodynamic evolution , </S>",
    "<S> the data at @xmath0 gev at various centralities in full pseudorapidity range are well described , and the charged particle multiplicity are reproduced as functions of the number of participants . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence of the shape of the @xmath1 distribution is also described at various collision energies @xmath2 gev in central collisions with same value of parameters except @xmath3 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated rapidity distributions and yields for the charged pions and kaons in central au+au collisions at @xmath4 gev are compared with experimental data of the brahms collaboration . </S>"
