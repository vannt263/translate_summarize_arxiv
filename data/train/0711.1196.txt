    "glitches in pulsars are rare and extraordinary events .",
    "the study of such glitches and their post - glitch recoveries can give an insight into the interior of neutron stars , the physics of ultradense matter and provide limits on the equation of state @xcite .",
    "pulsar glitches are usually detected from long - term and frequent timing observations .",
    "the number of observed glitches has increased dramatically in the past few years , which probably is due to both the increased continuous observations of active pulsars and a large number of new young pulsars detected by the pulsar surveys ( e.g. , the parkes surveys , see * ? ? ? * ) over the last decade .",
    "glitches are characterized as sudden increases in the rotation frequency @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the pulsar period ) , often followed by an interval of approximately exponential recovery or relaxation back towards the pre - glitch frequency .",
    "the post - glitch relaxation can have timescale of days to years .",
    "frequency jumps with magnitudes @xmath7 are recognized as `` giant '' glitches , and have been observed mostly in pulsars with characteristic ages @xmath8  yr , such as psrs  b0833@xmath045 ( the vela pulsar ) , b1046@xmath058 and b1338@xmath062 @xcite .",
    "giant glitches have not been observed in the youngest radio pulsars , such as psr  b0531 + 21 ( the crab pulsar ) and psr  b1509@xmath058 .",
    "detected glitches are generally of magnitude @xmath9 , and the relative increment in slow - down rate @xmath10 is in the range @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "very small glitches with @xmath13 are difficult to distinguish from timing noise in young pulsars @xcite . of the 1750 known pulsars , about 170 glitches in 54 pulsars have been observed so far .",
    "half of the published glitches have fractional amplitudes @xmath14 .",
    "most glitches detected in the vela pulsar are giant glitches , and the largest glitch , with @xmath15 , was observed in psr j1806@xmath02125 @xcite .",
    "about 60% of the 54 glitching pulsars have glitched only once , and 16% have glitched twice .",
    "observations with rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) have revealed that psr j0537@xmath06910 , the 16-ms pulsar associated with the supernova remnant n157b in the large magellanic cloud , is the most frequently glitching known pulsar with 23 glitches detected in seven years of monitoring @xcite .",
    "most of the glitches have @xmath16 of a few@xmath17 and , interestingly , a strong correlation is observed between the amplitude of a glitch and the time to the next one . furthermore , despite the usual post - glitch recovery ( decrease ) in @xmath4 , a persistent long - term increase in this parameter is observed , corresponding to a negative braking index @xmath18 .",
    "this increase is most probably related to changes on or in the neutron star that result from the glitch activity .    in this paper",
    "we report on six recent glitches detected in the period of psr  b1737@xmath030 and discuss the implications of these results .",
    "psr  b1737@xmath030 is a young radio pulsar with a characteristic age of @xmath19  yr which glitches frequently , with 20 glitches of all sizes ranging from `` small '' to `` giant '' ( @xmath20 to @xmath3 ) observed since its discovery in 1986 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* this paper ) . as for psr j0537@xmath06910",
    ", there appears to be a cumulative shift in the spin - down rate of psr b1737@xmath030 resulting from its frequent glitches , which most likely accounts for its long - term braking index of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the timing observations of psr b1737@xmath030 using the 25-m nanshan radio telescope of urumqi observatory started in 2000 january using a room - temperature dual - channel receiver . from 2002 july a dual - channel cryogenic receiver system sensitive to two orthogonal polarizations was used at a central observing frequency of 1540 mhz .",
    "two polarizations , each of bandwidth 320 mhz , are fed to a filterbank consisting of @xmath22 channels of width 2.5 mhz .",
    "the data are digitized to one - bit precision with a sampling interval of 1 ms .",
    "time is provided by a hydrogen maser clock calibrated using the global positioning system .",
    "observations times for psr b1737 - 30 were generally 16 min with the room - temperature receiver before 2002 july and 4 min with the cryogenic receiver after that date .",
    "the data are dedispersed with off - line programs to remove the effects of interstellar dispersion , and then folded at the pulsar s nominal topocentric period with four sub - integrations per observation .",
    "the pulse profiles obtained by summing an observation were cross - correlated with a high signal - to - noise template of the pulsar profile to produce accurate pulse topocentric times of arrival ( toas ) , which are then processed with the standard timing program tempo to convert them to barycentric arrival times at infinite frequency .",
    "the toas refer to the peak of the main pulse .",
    "the jet propulsion laboratory ephemeris de405 is used to correct the toas to the solar system barycenter .",
    "the folded profiles are stored on disk for subsequent processing and analysis .",
    "timing observations are usually made approximately three times per month and the glitching pulsars are observed more frequently .",
    "we use the corrected barycentric toas to determine the basic parameters of the pulsar .",
    "the basic timing model gives the predicted rotational pulse phase @xmath23 , as a function of time , t : @xmath24 timing irregularities appear as phase residuals ( @xmath25 ) , which are usually divided by @xmath26 to place them in time units .",
    "for a glitching pulsar the residuals suddenly develop a negative slope at the time of the glitch as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fg : gl_phs ] . the frequency perturbation due to the glitch",
    "can usually be described by : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the change in pulse frequency relative to the pre - glitch model , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the permanent changes in frequency and frequency derivative respectively and @xmath31 is the amplitude of the exponential recovery with a decay time constant of @xmath32 . the total frequency jump at the time of the glitch @xmath33 and the degree of recovery is often described by the parameter @xmath34 . because of the decaying component , the instantaneous change in @xmath35 at the glitch differs from @xmath30 : @xmath36 the glitch model of equation [ eq : gl_model ] describes the post - glitch behaviour fairly well for most glitches @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,<,<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the glitch activity , @xmath37 , defined as the mean fractional change in period per year owing to glitches @xcite , is given by the simple expression : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the total fractional increase of frequency owing to all of the glitches over an interval of @xmath40 .",
    "psr b1737@xmath030 has a relatively high glitch activity with @xmath41 yr@xmath42 .",
    "an advantage of @xmath37 as a long - term indicator of glitch effects is that it is relatively insensitive to the additional discovery of smaller glitches as the data quality improves @xcite .",
    "pulsars can be grouped into three classes : pulsars with low glitch activity ( e.g. , psr b0525 + 21 ) , high glitch activity ( e.g. , vela pulsar ) and no glitch activity .",
    "psr b1737@xmath030 belongs among those with high glitch activity .",
    "the pulsars with characteristic ages between @xmath43 and @xmath44 yr are more likely to have higher glitch activity than the younger ones ( @xmath45yr ) or the older ones ( @xmath46yr ) as shown by statistical studies of pulsar glitches @xcite .",
    "[ fg : spin - rate ] shows the evolution of the spin frequency @xmath26 and the slow - down rate @xmath35 over 20 years .",
    "clearly , the long - term evolution of @xmath26 is dominated by the regular spin - down  the glitches are not even visible on this plot . the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fg : spin - rate ] shows that there has been a long - term decrease in @xmath35 ( increase in @xmath4 ) of about @xmath1 0.1% over the 20 years .",
    "this corresponds to a value of @xmath47 .",
    "the braking index is therefore @xmath48 for the long - term evolution of psr b1737@xmath030 .",
    "inter - glitch data spans are frequently affected by relaxation from large glitches and generally have large positive braking indices @xcite .",
    "for example , we obtain a braking index of @xmath49 by fitting the data starting 500 days after the last glitch ( mjd 53550  54095 ) .    as mentioned in the introduction , a negative long - term braking index",
    "is also observed for psr j0537@xmath06910 @xcite .",
    "permanent increases in @xmath4 associated with glitches are also observed in the crab pulsar @xcite . in this case",
    "though , since the glitches are much smaller , they do not bias the observed braking index so much .",
    "the vela pulsar also has an anomalously low value of @xmath50 @xcite which may be likewise related to the frequent glitches .",
    "a possible interpretation of these observations is that the component of the magnetic dipole moment which is perpendicular to the spin axis increases at the time of a glitch @xcite .",
    "[ fg : spin - rate](b ) also shows what appears to be a cyclic variation in @xmath51 superimposed over the linear trend .",
    "such a cyclic variation would have @xmath1 3000d period and needs at least another cycle to confirm .",
    "[ fg : ppdot ] is a plot of pulsar period p versus period derivative @xmath52 of all known 1700 pulsars which distinguishes the glitching pulsars and other different classes of pulsars .",
    "the most frequently glitching pulsars are young and have relatively strong dipole fields .",
    "some glitching pulsars are older , including psr b1821@xmath024 , which is a recycled pulsar in the globular cluster m28 @xcite . at present ,",
    "20 pulsars have detected giant glitches and , except psr b2224 + 65 whose age is @xmath53 yr , all the pulsars which have giant glitches are in the younger group .",
    "our observations of psr b1737@xmath030 show six glitches in psr b1737@xmath030 over a period of seven years . in total ,",
    "20 glitches have been observed over a 20-year period .",
    "glitch sizes cover a wide range from just a few parts in @xmath54 to large glitches comparable to those seen in the vela pulsar .",
    "the inter - glitch intervals are highly variable , ranging from 3 weeks to more than 3 years .",
    "unlike in psr j0537@xmath06910 , there is no clear relationship of glitch interval with size of the preceding glitch .",
    "although the age of psr b1737@xmath030 is comparable to that of the vela pulsar , their glitch behaviours are different , with glitch sizes and intervals being much more variable in psr b1737@xmath030 .",
    "exponential and quasi - linear relaxations in @xmath35 are observed in both pulsars , but with quite different parameters .",
    "it is remarkable that the three most highly glitching pulsars have such different glitch and post - glitch properties , yet another example of the diversity and complexity of magnetised neutron stars .",
