    "the laws of quantum mechanics forbid the perfect cloning of unknown quantum states @xcite .",
    "this important result , known as the no - cloning theorem , bases on the linearity of the quantum - mechanical transformations and has been subject of continuous research in the last decades . in particular ,",
    "the problem of approximate cloning has been exhaustively explored @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that it imposes a limit on our capability to manipulate and broadcast quantum information and because it can be used as an efficient eavesdropping attack on quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite .",
    "the impossibility of generating perfect copies imposed by the no - cloning theorem can be relaxed by resorting a non deterministic process .",
    "this kind of process is called probabilistic cloning , where a set of known linearly independent nonorthogonal quantum states can be cloned perfectly at the expense of succeeding with probability less than one @xcite .",
    "this kind of cloning is of particular interest when testing the security of the so called b92 qkd protocol @xcite , which involves only two non - orthogonal linearly independent states .",
    "other applications and implementations are studied in @xcite and @xcite    recently , this probabilistic cloning scheme has been successfully implemented via nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite in the case of generating two clones of a single qubit state .",
    "this demonstration , however , does not allow the broadcasting of the cloned states .",
    "this led us to propose the implementation of an optimal probabilistic cloning based on entangled twin photons @xcite .",
    "this proposal is based on linear optics together with a pair of maximally entangled twin photons generated via spontaneous parametric down - conversion .",
    "the states to be cloned are encoded in the polarization degree of freedom of one of the twin photons . after a sequence of measurements",
    "the state to be cloned as well as its perfect clone are encoded in the polarization and spatial degree of freedom of the resting photon respectively .",
    "the former photon is destroyed in a photo - detection process .",
    "thereby , the clones are produced in a non - local way and can be broadcasted .",
    "sources of polarized entangled pairs of photons have been shown to have very good fidelities when comparing with bell states @xcite , but additional loses can appear when distributing the entangled pairs at large distances , and also other fluctuations can make the state imperfect .",
    "therefore even if the source is close to perfect the state shared by the different parties is not necessary close to perfect .",
    "this is a serious issue , since perfect clones are created only when the parties share a perfect entangled state . in this work we present an example of how is still possible to have high fidelity copies even if the entanglement is not high quality .",
    "we study the performance of the nlopc process when cloning a state from a known set of linearly independent nonorthogonal states , implemented via a partially entangled state of a pair of twin photons .",
    "we show that the errors introduced by the use of partial entanglement can be undone by applying a quantum state discrimination process to the photon which encodes original and copy states .",
    "this process is applied after the nlopc protocol has been carried out .",
    "the correction procedure is based on the application of unambiguous state discrimination and does not requires information about the state undergoing the cloning process @xcite .",
    "this procedure is complete determined by the schmidt coefficients of the partially entangled state and the measurement results of the cloning process . since",
    "quantum state discrimination is a probabilistic process the correction succeeds with a certain probability .",
    "the clones emerging from the correction procedure are perfect but the overall success probability of generating perfect clones is thus reduced by a factor given by the optimal probability of unambiguously discriminating two nonorthogonal states , that is the ivanovic - dieks - peres limit .",
    "the states to be discriminated are defined by the schmidt coefficients of the partially entangled quantum channel .",
    "we also study the possibility of local probabilistic cloning ( lpc ) where the states to be cloned are encoded in the polarization degree of freedom of one of the twin photons while a perfect clone is generated and encoded in the spatial degree of freedom of the same photon .",
    "thus , the clones are produced locally .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the resting photon are used as ancillary systems to implement conditional transformations .",
    "the experimental setup for lpc turns out to be simpler than in the case of nlopc but the success probability of the lpc is the half of the success probability of nlopc .",
    "we also study the case local probabilistic cloning via partially entangled twin photons .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section [ sectionii ] we summarize briefly the the optimal probabilistic cloning process . in section [ sectioniiib ]",
    "we present the experimental setup for implementing the lpc .",
    "section [ sectioniv ] is devoted to study the performance of the proposed setup for lpc when the entanglement it is not maximal . in section [ section5 ]",
    "we analyze the nlopc via a partially entangled state and show that the addition of an unambiguous state discrimination stage corrects the errors generated by the partial entanglement at the expense of reducing the overall success probability of generating perfect clones . in section [ sectionv ]",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "the probabilistic quantum cloning machine is constructed by concatenating a unitary transformation @xmath0 and a projective measurement @xcite .",
    "the action of the unitary transformation is @xmath1 where @xmath2 are two nonorthogonal states encoded in the original system @xmath3 .",
    "these are the states to be cloned .",
    "the perfect clone of each one of these states is encoded in the copy system @xmath4 as @xmath5 .",
    "additionally , the transformation requires a third ancillary system @xmath6 spanned by the orthogonal states @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "initially , systems @xmath4 and @xmath6 are described by a joint blank state @xmath9 .",
    "after the unitary transformation @xmath0 has been carried out a measurement on system @xmath6 projects it onto state @xmath7 .",
    "systems @xmath3 and @xmath4 are then described by a product state formed by the original state and its clone .",
    "this succeeds with an optimal probability @xmath10 given by @xmath11 in case of projecting system @xmath6 onto state @xmath8 systems @xmath3 and @xmath4 are left in an entangled state @xmath12 , which does not correspond to a cloning process . considering the states to be cloned as @xmath13 ,",
    "the action of the unitary transformation @xmath0 onto the basis states @xmath14 and @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath19 in this case the success probability , according to eq .",
    "( [ success - probability ] ) , is given by @xmath20 and the state @xmath12 becomes @xmath21 . in the scheme that we study",
    "the fidelity is unitary and the probability is given by eq . [ success - probability - particular ] , then @xmath22 .",
    "we can compare this with the performance of the universal cloning machine , see for example @xcite , which is a deterministic process , but with limited fidelity equal to @xmath23 , in which case @xmath24 .",
    "it is straight forward to see that our scheme of probabilistic cloning overperforms universal cloning when @xmath25 considering this particular figure of merit .",
    "analytical solutions for the problem of cloning larger sets of linearly independent states are known in cases where the states to be cloned have a high degree of symmetry @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup proposed for implementing the local probabilistic cloning of single - qubit states is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ setup ] ) .",
    "this requires the use of a source for generating a maximally entangled polarization state of two photons .",
    "this state can be generated via spontaneous parametric down - conversion of type - i using the scheme presented in @xcite and is of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 describe horizontal and vertical polarization for photon @xmath29 .",
    "photon @xmath30 is directed toward interferometer @xmath31 which is defined by polarizing beam splitters @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "states @xmath34 and @xmath35 describe the spatial state of photon @xmath30 propagating at the upper or lower arm of the interferometer , correspondingly .",
    "photon @xmath36 enters into interferometer @xmath37 whose two input ports are defined by polarizing beamsplitter @xmath38 .",
    "the three output ports of @xmath37 are generated by polarizing beam splitter @xmath39 and beam splitter @xmath40 .",
    "states @xmath41 and @xmath42 describe the spatial state of the photon @xmath36 propagating at the upper or lower arm of interferometer @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "this interferometer is lossy since polarizing beamsplitter @xmath39 allows vertically polarized photons to leave the interferometer .",
    "the state of the twin photons after polarizing beam splitters @xmath32 and @xmath38 is given by latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath107 . as was shown in section ( [ sectioniv ] ) ,",
    "making use of unambiguous state discrimination is possible to perform the following transformations , @xmath162 which correct the state @xmath158 , however this transformation also introduces a non - conclusive result in the process which is characterized by a certain probability of success .",
    "this transformation can be implemented using a conditional interferometer . in order to correct the state ( [ phi2 ] )",
    "two interferometers are needed , one for the pair ( [ eq : alpha- ] ) and other for ( [ eq : alpha - tilde ] ) , see ( [ transformation ] ) the first interferometer , @xmath163 , acts on photons coming from path @xmath164 and is characterized by the transformation @xmath165 where @xmath90 is the angle defined by the half wave plate inside the interferometer and has to be set to @xmath166 the paths @xmath167 and @xmath168 define the result of the transformation , that means whether discrimination was successful , @xmath167 , or failed , @xmath168 .",
    "finally , the probability of successfully discriminate the pair of states ( [ eq : alpha- ] ) is given by @xmath169 the procedure is similar for the other interferometer , @xmath170 , where the transformation is characterized by @xmath171 and the probability of success is given by @xmath172 the joint action of @xmath163 and @xmath170 over state @xmath173 is given by @xmath174 the first term describes the successful process , where the two clones are generated in the polarization and spatial degree of freedom of photon 2 , and the last term of equation ( [ eq : result ] ) describes the failure process in which an entangled state is obtained , this state is independent of the state to be cloned .",
    "the process is the same for state @xmath175 , and is analogous for the remaining states , @xmath176 and @xmath177 , in which the tilting angle of the half wave plate in the interferometers has to be changed and an extra unitary transformation ( ruo ) is necessary before applying the two conditional interferometers .",
    "finally , the total probability of success is determined by both the optimum probability of cloning and the probability of unambiguously discriminate between two non - orthogonal states , @xmath178",
    "the cloning of quantum states has been a constant subject of study over the last decades .",
    "this process has been experimentally implemented in the case of approximate universal cloning @xcite and variations .",
    "the realization of probabilistic cloning has been only recently achieved via nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "since this proposal requires the use of ensemble techniques , it does not constitute cloning of individual quantum systems .    here",
    ", we have studied the possibility of implementing probabilistic cloning via twin photons in an all - optical setup .",
    "this allows the broadcasting of the clones .",
    "we have proposed an experimental setup for realizing the probabilistic cloning of two nonorthogonal quantum states .",
    "the states to be cloned are encoded in the polarization degree of freedom of a single photon while the clones are encoded in the two available propagation paths of the same photon .",
    "the resting twin photon is employed as an ancillary system to carry out conditional transformations .",
    "this proposal achieves an overall success probability equal to the half of the optimal cloning probability .",
    "this is due to the use of a filtering process after that the state to be cloned has been encoded .",
    "a second characteristic of our proposal is the use of recovery operators to correct errors arisen in the cloning process itself , which is akin to quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "a different approach to the problem of probabilistic nonlocal cloning has also been reported @xcite but considering a ghz state of a tripartite system as initial source and make use of an additional port qubit owned by the sender which make it more difficult to implement .",
    "additional , it is not symmetric , which means that each copy is created with a different success probability .",
    "we have also studied the consequences of a partially entangled state as quantum channel for the cloning process and shown that the errors generated by this class of channel can be probabilistically corrected by means of unambiguous state discrimination .",
    "the total probability of generating perfect clones is then reduced by a factor equal to the optimal probability of discriminating two nonorthogonal states which are defined by the schmidt coefficients of the quantum channel . in this way we showed that the effect of having a nonmaximal entangled state as a source and correcting after is a diminution in the rate of the perfect clones generation .",
