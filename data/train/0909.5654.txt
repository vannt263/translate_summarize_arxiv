    "inference of unknown structures from point data is a fundamental problem in many areas of science and engineering that has motivated wide spread research  @xcite .",
    "typically , this data is assumed to be sampled from a manifold sitting in a high dimensional space whose geometric and topological properties are to be derived from the data . in this work ,",
    "we are particularly interested in computing a set of loops from data which not only captures the topology but is also aware of the geometry of the sampled manifold .",
    "specifically , we aim to approximate a shortest basis for the one dimensional homology group from the data .    recently , a few algorithms for computing homology groups from point data have been developed .",
    "one approach would be to reconstruct the sampled space from its point data  @xcite and then apply known techniques for homology computations on triangulations  @xcite . however , this option is not very attractive since a full - blown reconstruction with known techniques requires costly computations with delaunay triangulations in high dimensions .",
    "chazal and oudot  @xcite showed how one can use less constrained data structures such as rips , ech , and witness complexes to infer the rank of the homology groups by leveraging persistence algorithms  @xcite . among these ,",
    "the rips complexes are the easiest to compute though they consume more space than the others , an issue which has started to be addressed  @xcite .",
    "all of the above works so far considered only focus on computing the betti numbers , the rank of the homology groups .",
    "although the persistence algorithms  @xcite also provide representative cycles of a homology basis , they remain oblivious to the geometry of the manifold . as a result",
    ", these cycles do not have nice geometric properties . a natural question to pose",
    "is that if the loops of the one dimensional homology group are associated with a length under some metric , can one approximate / compute a shortest set of loops that generate the homology group in polynomial time ?",
    "this question has been answered in affirmative for the special case of surfaces when they are represented with triangulations  @xcite .",
    "in fact , considerable progress has been made for this special case on various versions of the problem .",
    "we can not apply these techniques , mainly because we deal with point data instead of an input triangulation .",
    "also , these works either consider a surface  @xcite instead of a manifold of arbitrary dimension in an euclidean space , or use a local measure other than the lengths of the generators in a basis  @xcite .",
    "our main result is an algorithm that can compute a set of loops from a rips complex of the given data and a proof that the lengths of the computed loops approximate those of a shortest basis of the one dimensional homology group of the sampled manifold . in arriving at this result",
    ", we also show how to compute a shortest basis for the one dimensional homology group of any finite _ simplicial complex _",
    "whose edges have non - negative weights .",
