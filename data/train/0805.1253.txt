    "a proper treatment of the nucleonic vacuum is thus very important .",

    "the meson coupling constants and masses with asterisks denote their density dependence , given by the br scaling  @xcite .",
    "the density dependence of parameters is described by the scaling functions that are the ratios of the in - medium parameters to those in the free space .",
    "we take the scaling function for meson masses as given in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath9 where the linear dependence on density is similar to the nambu scaling  @xcite but with a much smaller coefficient @xmath10 suggested by recent experiments  @xcite . here ,",
    "the scaling for the nucleon is not considered since the nucleon mass already drops in the medium due to the coupling to the @xmath2 meson .",
    "the scaling functions for the coupling constants of scalar and vector mesons read @xmath11 which are necessary for an appropriate description of nuclear matter properties  @xcite .",

    "both hadron masses and meson - nucleon coupling constants depend on the current quark mass . however , based on an analysis in the linear @xmath2 model , the derivative of the coupling constant with respect to the current quark mass is smaller than that of the hadron masses by a factor @xmath41  @xcite , with the pion - nucleon sigma term @xmath42 .",

    "@xcite the two - pion exchange processes including the intermediate @xmath51 isobar excitations instead of the surrogated @xmath2-meson exchange were considered , and a hindered tendency toward the chiral symmetry restoration at high densities was still shown . in these chiral effective field theories",
    "@xcite , the short - range nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions only play a minor role on the change of the in - medium quark condensate , while the long- and intermediate - range nn interactions from one- and two - pion exchanges dominate the hindrance . this observation is instructive , though different from that in the one - boson - exchange approaches  @xcite . however , the strict renormalization for the low - energy physics and contact interactions in these chiral effective field theories is nevertheless imperative to further judge whether the additional degrees of freedom are necessary for describing the short - range interactions .",
    "though the progress of renormalization has been made recently  @xcite , this is still quite challenging . in these chiral effective theories that were built upon the chiral pertubative theory ,",
    "the vacuum is alienated in two folds : first , the pion as the goldstone boson that resides in the coset space is not accompanied by other boson degrees of freedom that carry the chirally invariant vacuum in the conserved subgroup space .",
    "second , in a non - relativistic treatment the nucleonic vacuum is out of touch .",
    "in fact , suitable renormalization scheme of the baryonic vacuum allows one to include consistently the vector mesons as explicit degrees of freedom in the lorentz - invariant baryon chiral perturbative theory  @xcite .",
    "since the chiral symmetry restoration is expected to occur at the short - range region with a chirally invariant vacuum , the present approach is of close relevance to dealing with the in - medium chiral condensate regarding the importance of the vacuum correction and the important role of short - range @xmath46-meson exchange . as we focus on the vacuum correction , the relation ( [ sgv ] ) , though phenomenological , can provide appropriate and referential information .",
    "the situation with the scalar @xmath2 meson is more involved since it has a broad mass spectrum starting roughly above @xmath52 , as a result of the equivalence of a variety of two - pion exchanges . as known in the linear @xmath2 model of gell - mann and levy  @xcite , the @xmath2 meson is regarded as the chiral partner of the goldstone boson ( @xmath53 meson ) . in this model",
    "the chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking are well manifested .",
    "although one can have some other choices to scale the sigma term for the @xmath2 meson  @xcite , we stress here that the symmetry of chirality is important and thus in our model that is designed to respect the chiral symmetry restoration at high densities we persist in using the sigma term for the @xmath2 meson obtained from the linear @xmath2 model , and at tree level it is  @xcite @xmath54 the use of this relation is consistent with present relativistic hartree approach which is also at tree level , though there can be high - order corrections to this relation . here",
    ", the @xmath2-meson mass is taken to be 590 mev .",
    "it was obtained by fitting ground - state properties of many nuclei with the same scaling functions used in our previous work  @xcite . using relations ( [ sc2 ] ) , ( [ sgm ] ) , ( [ sgv ] ) , ( [ sgsg ] ) and the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xmath55",
    "@xcite , the in - medium chiral condensate is eventually given by @xmath56 with the @xmath53-meson decay parameter @xmath57 mev and the @xmath53-meson mass @xmath58 mev .",
    "the first term in the bracket is the leading - order model - independent contribution . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the chiral condensate in symmetric nuclear matter where the @xmath47 meson does not contribute .",
    "we also do not consider the @xmath59 , @xmath53 and @xmath60 mesons , as they do not contribute to the symmetric nuclear matter either in the hartree approximation .",
    "in fact , within the dirac - brueckner approach , their contributions to the in - medium condensate are about two orders of magnitude smaller than those of @xmath2 and @xmath46 mesons  @xcite .",
    "note that the role of the @xmath53 meson in these relativistic one - boson - exchange theories is different from that in the effective field theories  @xcite , where the perturbative expansion with the unique @xmath53 meson degrees of freedom results in the multi - pion exchanges  @xcite .",
    "before presenting our results on the in - medium chiral condensate , we discuss more about the determinations of model parameters . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , besides the saturation properties of nuclear matter , namely , the incompressibility @xmath61 mev at saturation density @xmath62 , we also use as a constraint the eos of high density nuclear matter determined from analyzing the collective flow of relativistic heavy - ion collisions@xcite . here",
    ", we use the same scaling functions of meson masses and meson - nucleon coupling constants as for the model sl1 constructed in refs .",

    "consistent with the finding in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nucleon effective mass at saturation density increases significantly due to the vacuum correction .",
    "this means that the in - medium nucleon feels a scalar repulsion from the dirac sea , and it prevents nucleons in the fermi sea from falling to the fully - occupied dirac sea by sustaining a larger mass gap .",

    "the shaded area indicates the experimental constraint on the high - density eos@xcite .",
    "the model parametrization in the sl1 was selected such that the resulting eos passes through the middle of the constraint .",
    "comparing to the eos with the sl1 , it is seen that the pressure with the rsl1 is much reduced at high densities due to the vacuum correction . in order to bring the predicted pressure closer to the experimental region",
    ", we use another parameter set rsl2 that is adjusted to have a larger nucleon effective mass at saturation density , as listed in table [ t : t1 ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : f1 ] , the moderate readjustment of parameters results in a significant increase of pressure at high densities where the rearrangement term plays an important role .",
    "we have noticed that the energy density at high densities is dominated by the repulsion provided overwhelmingly by the @xmath46 meson .",
    "this is the main origin of the hindrance toward a chiral symmetry restoration observed using energy densities predicted by most meson - exchange many - body theories . in the simple rmf models , the repulsion increases linearly with density . after taking into account the higher - order correlations beyond the mean - field approximation within the db approach ,",
    "though the eos at high densities was softened , the increasing tendency of the in - medium chiral condensate was not overturned  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", this may also be understandable since these approaches are not really expected to give a correct description of chiral condensate at least near the critical density for the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "it was found very recently within the brueckner approach with chiral limit that nucleon - nucleon interactions lead to a weaker reduction of the in - medium chiral condensate in the density region where the effective field theory is applicable  @xcite , while little attention was paid to the saturation properties .",
    "the decreasing tendency of the in - medium chiral condensate can be obtained in rmf models by including the density - dependent coupling constants , namely the density - dependent ratios @xmath67 and @xmath68  @xcite . in this work , instead of modifying the ratios @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we will investigate the role played by the vacuum corrections .    , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ f : f2 ] , we show the in - medium chiral condensate evaluated using eq.([cc2 ] ) with the rmf models nl3",
    "@xcite and sl1 and the relativistic hartree models rsl1 and rsl2 .",
    "compared to the nl3 result , the in - medium chiral condensate with the sl1 is largely reduced at higher densities .",
    "this can be attributed to a much softened eos with the sl1  @xcite , compared to that with the nl3  @xcite . at high densities , however , the chiral condensate with the sl1 increases with density given the fact that the constant ratio @xmath68 in sl1 does not suppress the vector part of the energy density .",
    "the latter is quadratic in density , also see eqs.([eqe1 ] ) and ( [ cc2 ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the mass dropping given by the br scaling is not sufficient to reduce the chiral condensate to zero due to the nucleon - nucleon interactions in nuclear matter .    as the chiral condensate arises from the vacuum ,",
    "the appropriate description of the dirac vacuum contribution is imperative .",
    "the curve in the figure denoted by `` vacuum '' is calculated from the vacuum term @xmath30 in eq.([eqe1 ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the vacuum contribution to the in - medium chiral condensate becomes increasingly more important at higher densities .",
    "moreover , the vacuum correction in the energy density also includes the part that modifies the nucleon effective mass . in the renormalized model",
    "rsl1 the chiral condensate further goes down with the increasing density .",
    "we note that the vacuum energy density @xmath30 is positive and the scalar field @xmath2 that provides a big attraction is reduced due to the vacuum correction .",
    "thus , the vacuum correction actually gives rise to a scalar repulsion that impairs the role of the vector repulsion provided by the @xmath46 meson . as a result ,",
    "the much reduced @xmath69 with a consistent but smaller reduction of @xmath14 , subject to the given saturation properties , results in a softened eos and brings down the chiral condensate at high densities in the rsl1 , compared to that with the sl1 .",
    "interestingly , when we use the parameter set rsl2 that is adjusted to have an eos more close to the experimental constraint at high densities , see fig .  [",
    "f : f1 ] , the in - medium chiral condensate decreases further to zero by coincidence . as shown in eqs.([eqe1 ] ) and ( [ eqp1 ] ) , the vacuum correction @xmath30 contributes oppositely to the energy density and the pressure .",
    "this provides the intrinsic mechanism for the different changing tendencies in the energy density and the pressure , intriguing the shift going from the rsl1 to the rsl2 as observed in figs .",
    "[ f : f1 ] and [ f : f2 ] .",
    "numerically , we find that a larger cancellation of contributions from the scalar and vector mesons in the rsl2 , compared to the rsl1 , is responsible for the big half of the reduction of the chiral condensate from the rsl1 to the rsl2 , whereas the rest reduction arises directly from the variation of the vacuum correction .",
    "this further shows a direct link between the in - medium chiral condensate and the vacuum correction from the dirac sea . with the vacuum correction ,",
    "the nucleon effective mass drops more slowly in nuclear matter . as it was also stressed in the modified rmf models  @xcite and the brueckner approach with the chiral limit  @xcite",
    ", there is a decoupling between the reductions of the nucleon effective mass and the chiral condensate at high densities .",
    "actually , this decoupling exists in most hadronic approaches where the in - medium chiral condensate increases whereas the nucleon effective mass drops at high densities .    in this work ,",
    "we have concentrated on investigating effects of the vacuum corrections on the in - medium chiral condensate . however , if the chiral condensate does not drop sufficiently at high densities , other corrections , such as , high - order correlation contributions , may help further bring it down .",
    "another simple way is to reduce the in - medium vector coupling constant .",
    "the expectation of vanishing chiral condensate at high densities would actually add some constraints on the in - medium scaling of the vector coupling constant in the framework of the br scaling .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that the parameter used in the scaling function for the meson masses is consistent with that extracted from recent low - density experimental data , see ref .",
    ". however , it may be risky to apply the currently used scaling function having a linear density dependence of meson masses to high densities . in ref .",
    "@xcite , different scalings were suggested for the regions below and above the saturation density .",
    "moreover , one may consider the use of the nucleon mass scaling .",
    "theoretical uncertainty may also exist in the approximations to determine the sigma terms for the vector and scalar mesons .",
    "certainly , all these details deserve further investigations .",
    "nevertheless , regardless of the very details and the uncertainties that ebb and flow , a definite fact is that the vacuum correction brings out a new mechanism favoring the reduction of the in - medium chiral condensate .",
    "in summary , we have studied the vacuum corrections in the relativistic hartree model using the density - dependent parameterizations according to the br scaling .",
    "the in - medium chiral condensate have been investigated using the hellmann - feynman theorem together with phenomenological relations for the current quark mass derivative of hadron masses . constrained by the saturation properties ,",
    "the vector repulsion is reduced by the scalar repulsion arising from the dirac sea .",
    "this results in the softened eos and the reduction of the in - medium chiral condensate at high densities .",
    "also , the vacuum correction from the dirac sea plays a direct and important role in generating the in - medium chiral condensate .",
