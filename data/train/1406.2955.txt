    "the equivalence between the two bridge link of type @xmath3 , introduced and classified by schubert @xcite , and the rational links associated to a continued fraction @xmath5   $ ] , introduced by conway @xcite , is one example of the beautiful relations between knot theory and other mathematical subjects , in this case number theory .",
    "in an elementary course of knot theory , this relation captures the students attention and imagination , but the known proof requires advanced techniques from 3-manifold theory that are out of reach at that level . for this reason",
    ", we seek an elementary proof , that follows the naive approach of finding an algorithm to change one of the diagrams into the other .",
    "in this paper we will transform the conway diagram @xmath6 of a rational link , associated to a continued fraction @xmath5 $ ] , with @xmath7 into a diagram @xmath8of the two bridge link of type @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the rational given by the continued fraction @xmath5   $ ] . in this way we give an elementary proof of the equivalence between the rational link @xmath9   $ ] and the two bridge link of type @xmath10 this equivalence can be found in @xcite , but this proof requires to consider the two fold cover of the link and the classification of the lens spaces .",
    "our proof differs completely of this approach , and instead , use the direct method of finding a set of moves , that can be described in a recursive way as a sequence of steps . in each step of the transformation process",
    "we are able to describe precisely the changes in the diagram and to produce a sequence of integers that keep track of the changes and will allow us to confirm that at the end of the transformation we obtain the diagram of the 2-bridge link of the right type .",
    "the result of this paper together with the results in @xcite and @xcite , the complete classification of rational links and two bridge links is completed , without requiring advanced techniques of three dimensional topology .    the role of knot theory as a didactic tool , not only in undergraduate courses but also as a subject to develop mathematical awareness in high school students , requires some effort to present part of the theory in an appropriate level .",
    "this elementary proof of the equivalence of the two families of links follows this approach .",
    "the technique used in the transformation of a rational diagram into a 2-bridge diagram can be implemented in the transformation of a link diagram given by a 6-plat into a 3-bridge diagram given by the schubert presentation as a triple @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are integers , see @xcite .",
