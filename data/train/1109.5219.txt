    "the two approaches both have shortcomings , and the corresponding predictions can be confronted with the experimental data in the future .    in the limit @xmath265 , the quark condensate @xmath266 serves as the order parameter and indicates that the chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "the quark condensate undergoes reduction in the nuclear matter , @xmath267 , the chiral symmetry is partially restored , for example , the in - medium nucleon mass @xmath268 can be approximated as @xmath269 and the mass reduction is rather large ; on the other hand , there appear new medium - induced condensates , for example , the @xmath270 , @xmath271 , etc , which also break the chiral symmetry . in the present case ,",
    "the medium - induced condensates are associated with the large heavy quark masses @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 or @xmath275 , the net effects do not always warrant that the chiral symmetry is monotonously restored with the increase of the density of the nuclear matter .",
    "the light vector current @xmath276 and axialvector current @xmath277 are invariant under the chiral transformation @xmath278 , however , the heavy vector current @xmath279 and axialvector current @xmath280 are mixed with each other under the transformation , the heavy quark currents @xmath279 and @xmath280 are not conserved in the limit @xmath265 , it is better to take the doublets @xmath281 , @xmath282 as the parity - doublets rather than the chiral - doublets .",
    "if we take into account the flavor @xmath158 symmetry of the light quarks , the chiral @xmath283 transformations require that the ground states @xmath284 and @xmath285 have their chiral partners @xmath286 and @xmath287 , respectively , those parity - doublets are chiral - doublets .",
    "when the density of the nuclear matter is large enough , the order parameter @xmath288 , the chiral symmetry is restored , the fermi gas approximation for the nuclear matter does not survive , there are free of the non - perturbative contributions from the condensates , and the parity - doublets ( or chiral - doublets ) maybe have degenerated masses approximately . in the present case ,",
    "we study the parity - doublets ( or chiral - doublets ) in the low nuclear density , the mass breaking effects of the parity - doublets ( or chiral - doublets ) maybe even larger .",
    "the axialvector current @xmath289 interpolates the axialvector meson @xmath290 has non - vanishing coupling with the scattering state @xmath291 , in the soft @xmath292 limit , the coupling constant @xmath293 can be estimated as @xmath294|d^*\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{i}{f_\\pi}\\langle 0|\\bar{d}(x)\\gamma_\\mu   c(x)|d^*\\rangle = -\\frac{if_{d^*}m_{d^*}\\epsilon_\\mu}{f_\\pi}=i\\lambda_{d^*\\pi}\\epsilon_\\mu \\ , , \\\\ & = & f_{d_1}m_{d_1}\\varepsilon_\\mu \\frac{i}{p^2-m_{d_1}^2 } \\langle d_1|d^*\\pi\\rangle \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the axial - charge @xmath295 , and the @xmath296 and @xmath297 are the polarization vectors of the vector and axialvector mesons @xmath0 and @xmath2 , respectively @xcite , the formula in eq.(24 ) survives beyond the soft @xmath292 limit . the coupling constant @xmath293 is a large quantity and can not be neglected .",
    "the rescatterings @xmath298 @xmath79 also have contributions to the hadronic spectral densities . in the heavy meson chiral unitary approach",
    ", we can use the bethe - salpeter equation to perform the summation of the infinite series of the intermediate meson - loops ( such as the @xmath291 , @xmath299 , @xmath300 ) to obtain the full @xmath301 scattering amplitude , and generate the axialvector meson @xmath290 dynamically @xcite .",
    "if we saturate the full @xmath301 scattering amplitude with the exchanges of the intermediate axialvector meson @xmath290 , the @xmath291 rescattering effects lead to the renormalization @xmath302 in the hadronic representation of the correlation functions , where the @xmath303 denotes the renormalized self - energy of the intermediate @xmath291 loops , and contributes a finite imaginary part to modify the dispersion relation .",
    "in fact , the contributions of the intermediate meson - loops are very large , we have to take the mass @xmath304 as the bare mass @xmath305 to absorb the real part of the un - renormalized self - energy to reproduce the physical mass , the net effects are embodied in the finite imaginary part",
    ". we can take into account those meson - loops effectively by taking the following replacement for the hadronic spectral density , @xmath306 here we neglect the complicated renormalization procedure for simplicity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the energy dependence of the width , and approximate it with the experimental value from the particle data group . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we observe that a width about ( or less than ) @xmath307 can not change the prediction significantly , the @xmath308 function approximation for the spectral densities still survives . in the present case , @xmath309 from the particle data group @xcite ,",
    "the contaminations from the intermediate state @xmath291 are expected to be small .",
    "analogical discussions can be applied to the contaminations from the intermediate state @xmath310 .",
    "the negative scattering lengths @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate that the @xmath12 and @xmath13 interactions are attractive , it is possible to form the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bound states ; while the positive scattering lengths @xmath10 and @xmath11 indicate that the @xmath14 and @xmath15 interactions are repulsive , it is difficult to form the @xmath14 and @xmath15 bound states . according to the observations of the present work and refs.@xcite , we can draw the conclusion tentatively that the negative parity heavy mesons decrease their masses in the nuclear matter while the positive parity heavy mesons increase their masses .",
    "the decays of the high charmonium states to the negative parity charmed meson pairs @xmath20 and @xmath43 are facilitated , while the decays to the positive parity charmed mesons pairs @xmath311 and @xmath44 are suppressed .",
