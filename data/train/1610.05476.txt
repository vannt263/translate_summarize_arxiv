    "since the higgs boson discovery at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) in 2012@xcite , establishing the properties of the higgs boson , especially its couplings to the standard model ( sm ) particles , has been one of the primary missions of the current lhc run .",
    "furthermore , the so - called naturalness problem is still a haunting nightmare and is the driving force for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the littlest higgs model ( lhm ) is a prominent realization of the little higgs mechanism , which is proposed to ameliorate the fine - tuning problem @xcite . in the lhm , a global @xmath3 symmetry and a locally gauged subgroup @xmath4 \\otimes [ su(2)_{2 } \\otimes u(1)_{2}]$ ]",
    "are introduced .",
    "the global symmetry @xmath3 is broken into its subgroup @xmath5 at the scale @xmath6 . in the meantime , the local gauge symmetry @xmath7^{2}$ ] is broken into its diagonal subgroup @xmath8 spontaneously , which is identified as the sm electroweak gauge group .",
    "it is well known that the sm gauge bosons and the top quark contribute quadratic divergent terms to the higgs boson mass . in the lhm ,",
    "several heavy gauge bosons ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) and one heavy vectorlike quark ( @xmath12 ) are introduced to cancel these quadratic divergences at the one - loop level .",
    "these additional heavy particles might exhibit signatures at the lhc .",
    "the associated @xmath0 production is one of the most important higgs production channels at hadron colliders , and it is a direct process to investigate the @xmath13 coupling . there have already been thorough efforts for precise predictions of the @xmath14 process . the next - to - leading - order ( nlo )",
    "qcd and electroweak ( ew ) corrections have been calculated in refs.@xcite .",
    "the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd corrections also have been performed in refs.@xcite .    however , the fixed - order calculation is reliable only when all the scales are of the same order of magnitude . at the phase space boundaries , for example ,",
    "when the @xmath0 system is produced with small @xmath15 or with invariant mass approaching the partonic center - of - mass energy , i.e. , @xmath16 , the coefficients of the perturbative expansion in @xmath17 are enhanced by powers of large logarithms @xmath18 or @xmath19 , which spoil the convergence of the fixed - order predictions . in order to obtain reliable results at the boundaries of the phase space , these large logarithms need to be resummed . the transverse momentum resummation technique @xcite is proposed for the summation of the large logarithms of the type @xmath18 , and the threshold resummation technique @xcite for the summation of the large logarithms of the type @xmath19 .",
    "the transverse momentum resummation and the threshold resummation effects for @xmath0 production at the lhc in the sm were presented in refs.@xcite .",
    "the calculation for the nnlo qcd corrections to the sm higgs boson production in association with a @xmath20-boson at hadron colliders has been implemented by o. brein _",
    "they find that the contribution from the lowest order @xmath2-fusion channel at the lhc is more important than the other qcd nnlo corrections to @xmath0 production .",
    "the qcd nlo calculation of the @xmath0 production at the lhc within the framework of the lhm was provided in our previous work @xcite , where the effects of the lhm up to the qcd nlo from the @xmath21 annihilation channel were investigated , but the contribution from the @xmath2-fusion channel was absent .    in this work ,",
    "we study the effects of the littlest higgs model on the @xmath0 production at the qcd nlo and the next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) level including the lowest contribution from the @xmath2-fusion channel .",

    ", we give a glance at the lhm theory . in sec.iii",

    "the numerical analyses and discussions are presented in sec.iv , where some numerical results of the integrated cross section and differential cross section by adopting the transverse momentum resummation and the threshold resummation are provided .",

    "those peaks come from the diagrams for the @xmath96process in the lhm that involve exchange of the @xmath74 and @xmath73 boson , separately .",
    "the uncertainty of the lo distribution is evidently the largest as expected , and the uncertainty of the nlo+nll corrected results is reduced visibly compared with the nlo distribution , especially in the large @xmath0 invariant mass region . from this respect , we can conclude that in studying the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution for the @xmath96process , the nlo+nll corrected prediction is more reliable than both the lo and the nlo corrected ones .",
    "in this paper , we calculate the qcd nlo+nll effects on the @xmath0 production in the lhm at the @xmath1 lhc including the contribution from the one - loop - induced @xmath2-fusion channel .",
    "we provide the total cross sections , the transverse momentum , and invariant mass distributions for @xmath0 associated production by combining the qcd nlo corrections obtained by means of perturbative qcd with the resummation of the large logarithmic contributions arising in the small @xmath100 area and the region close to the production threshold .",
    "we estimate the theoretical errors for the predictions of the total cross section and kinematic distributions , and find that the qcd nlo+nll correction improves the scale uncertainties of the lo and pure qcd nlo corrected results .",
