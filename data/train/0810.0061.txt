    "many m dwarfs , which are the most abundant stars in the milky way , have strong magnetic dynamos that give rise to chromospheric and coronal heating , producing emission from the x - ray to the radio .",
    "although this magnetic heating ( or activity ) has been observed for decades , the exact mechanisms that control magnetic activity in m dwarfs are still not well - understood .    in the sun ,",
    "activity is strongly linked to rotation .",
    "the rotation in solar type stars slows with time due to angular momentum loss from magnetized stellar winds ; as a result , magnetic activity decreases .",
    "there is strong evidence that the rotation - activity relation extends from stars more massive than the sun to smaller dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , at a spectral type of @xmath5m3 ( 0.35 m@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , stars become fully convective .",
    "this transition marks an important change in the stellar interior that has been thought to affect the production and storage of internal magnetic fields .",
    "a few studies have uncovered evidence of a possible rotation - activity ( using h@xmath0 ) relation extending past the m3 convective transition and into the brown dwarf regime @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of an unbiased sample of high resolution spectra of late - type m dwarfs complicates the situation .    using over 30,000 spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite showed that the activity fraction of m dwarfs varies as a function of stellar age ( using galactic height as a proxy for age ) and that the h@xmath0 activity lifetime for m6-m7.5 stars is 7 - 8 gyr .",
    "nearby samples of late - type m dwarfs are therefore biased towards young populations with high levels of activity ; until recently every known m7 dwarf was observed to be magnetically active @xcite .",
    "we present results from our study of the @xmath1sin@xmath2 rotation velocities for a small sample of m6-m7 dwarfs , most of which were selected to be inactive or weakly active from the sdss low - mass star spectroscopic sample .",
    "our sample was selected from the @xcite sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) m dwarf catalog , a spectroscopic sample of almost 40,000 m and l - type dwarfs .",
    "we selected the brightest m7 and m6 stars which were either inactive or weakly active ( as measured by their h@xmath0 emission ) .",
    "12 stars were selected using these criteria .",
    "two additional active m7 dwarfs were added to the sample for comparison to previous studies .",
    "while our sample is not a complete unbiased sample , representative of the underlying m dwarf population , it does consist of late - type m dwarfs with activity properties selectively different than previously observed .",
    "to measure the @xmath1sin@xmath2 rotation velocities for our sample , we used a cross - correlation technique similar to that of previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) : we cross - correlated each program spectrum with the spectrum of a slowly rotating comparison star .",
    "the width of the resulting cross correlation function is a direct probe of the rotational broadening .    to measure the rotational broadening of each spectrum , we compared the resulting cross - correlation function to that of a rotationally broadened template . the gl 406 template",
    "was rotationally broadened to larger rotation velocities using the technique of @xcite and cross - correlated with the original ( unbroadened ) template .",
    "a @xmath1sin@xmath2 was determined based on the best fit spun - up template .",
    "figure 1 shows the cross - correlation function of sdss094738.45 + 371016.5 with gl406 in the 7080 - 7140   region ( solid ) compared with the cross - correlation function of gl406 with the best - fit rotationally broadened gl406 spectrum ( dotted ; 6 kms@xmath4 ) , and the auto - correlation function of gl406 ( dashed ; 0 kms@xmath4 broadening ) .",
    "the cross - correlation reveals that sdss094738.45 + 371016.5 appears to be rotating with a velocity @xmath3 6 kms@xmath4    all of the spectra were spectral typed by eye using the hammer spectral analysis package @xcite on the sdss spectra .",
    "we measured the equivalent widths ( ew ) of the h@xmath0 emission lines in both the sdss and keck spectra .",
    "the keck spectra are more sensitive to low levels of emission ( they can be distinguished better against the pervasive molecular features ) ; it is also true in general that equivalent widths tend to be smaller when measured from high resolution spectra .",
    "almost all of our targets chosen to be inactive at low resolution proved inactive even at high resolution , and the ews when detected were similar .",
    "six of the fourteen m6-m7 dwarfs in our sample have detectable rotation .",
    "3 of the rotating stars have measurable activity but the other 3 show no signs of activity in any of the emission lines in either the sdss or keck spectra . the cross - correlation shown in figure 1 ( sdss094738.45 + 371016.5 )",
