    "the experimental study of charmed baryons , including measurement of their masses , widths and decay modes , is an important test of many theoretical models that provide quantitative predictions for the properties of heavy hadrons .    unlike the @xmath12 and even their excited states ,",
    "a thorough experimental study of the charmed double strange baryon @xmath0 is long overdue .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath13 is the heaviest known singly charmed hadron that decays weakly .",
    "the quark content of the @xmath0 is _ c@xmath14ss@xmath15 _ , where the _ ss _ pair is in a symmetric state .",
    "there are many theoretical models that predict the mass of the @xmath0 .",
    "however , the range of these predictions is rather wide : 26102786 mev/@xmath4 @xcite . among several published measurements of the @xmath0 mass",
    "only three report a statistically significant signal : e687 obtains @xmath16 mev/@xmath4 in the @xmath17 channel  @xcite , using five decay modes cleo reports @xmath18 mev/@xmath4  @xcite , babar quotes @xmath19 mev/@xmath4 in their analysis of @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the world - average value of the @xmath0 mass is @xmath21 mev/@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the decay mode @xmath22 was observed for the first time by e687  @xcite .",
    "they reported @xmath23 events over the background of 5.8 events . with 13.7 fb@xmath8 of data cleo also found a signal of @xmath24 events in this channel  @xcite .",
    "focus observes @xmath25 events of this decay mode  @xcite . with a data sample of 230.7 fb@xmath8",
    "babar reports a raw signal of @xmath26 events  @xcite .",
    "the spin excited @xmath27 @xmath1 state was observed by babar only recently  @xcite .",

    "we also confirm the recent babar observation of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the data used for this analysis were taken on the @xmath31 resonance and in the nearby continuum using the belle detector at the @xmath11 asymmetric - energy collider kekb  @xcite .",
    "the integrated luminosity of the sample is equal to 605 fb@xmath8 of on - resonance data and 68 fb@xmath8 of data below the @xmath9(4@xmath10 ) .",
    "belle is a general - purpose detector based on a 1.5 t superconducting solenoid ; a detailed description can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "tracking is performed by a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) composed of concentric layers of double - sided silicon strip detectors , and a 50 layer drift chamber ( cdc ) .",
    "particle identification for charged hadrons , important for the measurement of final states with kaons and/or protons , is based on the combination of energy loss measurements ( _ de / dx _ ) in the drift chamber , time - of - flight measurements ( tof ) and aerogel cherenkov counter ( acc ) information . for each charged particle ,",
    "measurements from these three subdetectors are combined to form likelihood ratios in the range from 0 to 1 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the likelihood values assigned to the @xmath35 or @xmath36 identification hypothesis for a given track . from now on we use these likelihood ratios to identify protons , charged kaons and pions with criteria that have efficiencies greater than @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the probability for each particle species to be misidentified as one of the other two is less than @xmath39 .",
    "an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) is used to detect photons , which are reconstructed from isolated ecl clusters that have no corresponding charged track , and a shower shape that is consistent with that of a photon .",

    "we then apply the following cuts on the @xmath40 decay vertex :    * the difference @xmath45 in the z - coordinate between the proton and pion at the decay vertex should satisfy @xmath462 cm , where the z - axis is parallel to the @xmath47 beam direction ; * the distance between the vertex position and interaction point ( ip ) in the plane transverse to the beam direction ( @xmath48 ) should be greater than 0.5 cm ; * the angle @xmath49 , between the @xmath40 momentum vector and the vector pointing from the ip to the @xmath40 decay vertex , should satisfy cos @xmath50 0.0 ; * the vertex fit should have an acceptable @xmath51 .",
