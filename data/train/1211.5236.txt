    "an important component of the undergraduate training in quantum mechanics is the solution of the three dimensional schrdinger equation for a particle that experiences a central potential , i.e. one in which the potential is a function only of the distance from the origin .",
    "then , the schrdinger equation is separable in spherical coordinates , and the angular part is determined analytically , in terms of the well known spherical harmonics and the associated legendre polynomials.@xcite what then remains is the solution of the radial part of the wave function , and typically some examples are worked out , like the infinite spherical well , the 3d harmonic oscillator , and of course , the hydrogen atom .",
    "the solution to the radial part of the wave function usually requires somewhat advanced mathematics , and tends to go in one of two ways , either ( i ) solution by recognition , or ( ii ) by power series .",
    "the first method amounts to declaring that the radial differential equation is one that has been studied for more than a century , and is ` easily ' recognizable as the ` insert famous name ' equation , and therefore has ` insert famous name ' functions as solutions .",
    "even worse from a student s point of view , is to declare that the solution is a confluent hypergeometric function with appropriate arguments , and perhaps leave as an exercise which famous name is associated with which arguments . the second method is a little more satisfying , in that the student ends up constructing the function that turns out to have a famous name associated with it , but there are often a number of preliminary steps required , whereby the asymptotic behaviours are ` peeled off ' , so that what remains is a simple polynomial ; this procedure is straightforward to those that are familiar with it , but to a novice in both quantum mechanics and in differential equations , the process can be somewhat daunting .",
    "this level of mathematics has its benefits , and is of course a required component of a physicist s toolkit .",
    "however , at this stage of a student s career it can also serve to dampen their enthusiasm for physics . as educators it is also important to consider that for students who eventually do not pursue a career in physics ( or mathematics ) , extensive knowledge of laguerre polynomials will probably not help them in their future career .",
    "furthermore , this way of solving problems will not be too helpful when it comes to examining potentials that are _ not _",
    "tractable by either of these methods .    at the same time",
    ", matrix mechanics is generally taught only in the abstract , with real implementations relegated to more advanced degrees , and usually in the context of many - body physics .",
    "we therefore suggest a general purpose numerical method for solving problems involving central forces in three dimensions ; the results obtained are necessarily approximate but very accurate .",
    "while this method should not replace the teaching of exact analytical methods referenced above , it provides a tool for learning the use of matrix mechanics methods , and for understanding the behaviour of the solutions of various potentials that can not be solved analytically .",
    "it has even been used very recently to provide insight to the differences between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons in atomic lithium.@xcite this method follows that already developed for one dimensional potentials in ref . .",
    "the virtue of this approach is that it requires only linear algebra and integral calculus , topics normally covered in a student s first year of university studies .",
    "the difficult part is that students need to have access to software tools at some basic level to carry out the linear algebra , and , in some cases , to perform the integrations that are required .",
    "our experience has been that this part is difficult for some students ; however , it is our belief that some familiarity with matlab , or maple , or mathematica will have broader application for the average student in the long run than a knowledge of non - elementary functions .",
    "we begin with an example which can be first addressed by standard methods , the coulomb potential , specifically for the hydrogen atom . in this way",
    "students can readily check their answers .",
    "the coulomb potential happens to be one of the most difficult examples to use , however .",
    "because of its long range it supports an infinite number of bound states ; as will be shown below it is impossible to recover all of these through the present approach , but a careful study of this problem will help to highlight the limitations and subtleties of this approach .",
    "probably a few tricks could be adopted to circumvent this difficulty , but this would run counter to our goals , as this method should be generally applicable to any potential that supports bound states .    we will then examine the finite spherical well , and determine for example , the critical depth required for at least one bound state to exist .",
    "this is also known analytically , and so will provide a benchmark for the present method .",
    "finally , we will examine solutions for the so - called yukawa potential , a useful potential both in nuclear physics , where it was used to model meson exchange between nucleons , and in condensed matter physics , where it is used to model coulomb interactions whose range has been shortened due to screening . solutions for this potential generally require advanced applications of perturbative or variational methods .",
    "we will make comparisons of our results with these .",
    "we should emphasize that we will not comment on numerical methods in this paper .",
    "we assume that students have access to software that can compute desired integrals and diagonalize reasonably large matrices .",
    "it is assumed that the necessary training for this procedure is a prerequisite to a student s first course in quantum mechanics.@xcite",
    "for a central potential the solution to the time - independent schrdinger equation is separable , @xmath2 where we have already written down the solution to the angular part  it consists of the spherical harmonics , which are functions of the standard spherical angles . following the usual procedure , one can replace the radial function @xmath3 with @xmath4 , and arrive at the so - called radial equation , @xmath5 which is identical to the one dimensional schrdinger equation for a particle of mass @xmath6 , except that the _ effective _ potential contains an additional so - called centrifugal term , @xmath7 note also that @xmath8 , and that @xmath9 ranges from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , because this schrdinger equation is for @xmath12 , and @xmath3 is well - behaved at the origin , then a boundary condition is that @xmath13.@xcite following ref .",
    "we embed this potential in an infinite square well@xcite extending from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is some cutoff radius , whose value will influence the results in a manner to be explained below .     and @xmath15 .",
    "note that we have used @xmath17 in the figure , and @xmath18 for the finite spherical well .",
    "also shown is an arbitrarily complicated potential well , to illustrate the point that this potential poses no further difficulty compared to the others , with this method.,width=259,height=326 ]    figure  1 shows the examples of the potentials we will use in this paper , plotted along with the infinite square well `` embedding '' potential .",
    "we also include an arbitrarily complicated potential well shape , to emphasize that this method can solve for any such potential .",
    "the rationale for this choice is that the embedding potential allows for a simple set of basis states , which are simply the eigenstates of the infinite potential well , @xmath19 with eigenvalues @xmath20 the embedding potential enforces that the function is zero at the origin , @xmath21 , but also now requires the function to vanish at the other wall , @xmath22 .",
    "such a formulation will work reasonably well for bound states in attractive potentials , and provides a basis set that is most familiar to students .",
    "now we write the radial equation in dirac notation as @xmath23|u\\rangle = e|u\\rangle , \\label{radial}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 includes both the kinetic energy and the infinite square well potential , so that @xmath25 if we now expand @xmath26 in terms of this basis set , @xmath27 and substitute this into eq .",
    "( [ radial ] ) , followed by an inner product with each bra @xmath28 , we obtain the matrix equation @xmath29 where the matrix elements are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the kronecker delta function .",
    "( [ matrix_elements ] ) is readily evaluated for any bound state potential , numerically if need be .",
    "we will begin with the coulomb potential experienced by an electron of reduced mass @xmath6 near a positively charged proton , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the charge of the electron ( proton ) and @xmath34 is the vacuum dielectric constant .",
    "note that both the coulomb potential and the centrifugal term are singular at the origin , but that the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ matrix_elements ] ) is not , and varies smoothly , apart from the oscillations of the sine functions .",
    "two issues should be raised before we proceed ; one is that the matrix size in the eigenvalue problem posed in eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) is infinite .",
    "this will be dealt with by utilizing an upper cutoff @xmath35 , and increasing the value of this cutoff until the results are converged . for large quantum numbers ,",
    "the basis states exhibit two related properties ; first , they have increasing energy , and for this reason , may be viewed as more and more irrelevant for contributions to low energy states . however , concomitantly they have finer spatial resolution .",
    "often it is the finer spatial resolution that is required to accurately describe a low - lying state , so sometimes a larger basis is required than one might think if only energy considerations are used .",
    "either way , numerical convergence is attained once basis states with very high energy and very sharp spatial resolution are not needed to describe the problem at hand .",
    "the second issue concerns the value of the width of the well , @xmath16 , or equivalently , the cutoff in radial distance .",
    "the natural unit of distance in the coulomb problem is the bohr radius , @xmath36 , since we know in advance that for the coulomb problem the bound states decay exponentially with radial distance @xmath9 . as we shall see , however , exponential decay is not as strong as we would like , particularly when there is a numerical coefficient in the exponent that stretches out the exponential decay , so that a cutoff in the radial distance is required to be many times ( 10 - 20 ) the bohr radius to get very accurate results for the ground state .",
    "for excited states this cutoff will have to be higher , to achieve the same level of accuracy .    for large well widths ,",
    "however , the basis states deteriorate in spatial resolution . to achieve the same spatial resolution , therefore",
    ", we will need to increase the value of @xmath35 .",
    "we will return to these comments as we examine particular examples in the following sections .",
    "for the coulomb potential we will focus on @xmath37 , to illustrate the method .",
    "note that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ matrix_elements ] ) can be written in terms of the so - called cosine integral . however , in the spirit of avoiding non - elementary functions ( this one is more easily evaluated in the form of the integral written in eq .",
    "( [ matrix_elements ] ) anyways ) , we simply do the integral numerically .",
    "note that in the interest of calculating as few of these integrals as is needed ahead of time , it is best to use a trigonometric identity@xcite before evaluating the integral .",
    "we obtain @xmath38 with @xmath39 where we used @xmath40 , added and subtracted unity to the cosines , and , in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ vcoul ] ) , we adopted the natural energy unit in the problem , @xmath41 , which is one rydberg ( @xmath42 ev ) .",
    "similar simplification is applicable for the centrifugal term if needed .",
    "having decided on a value of @xmath43 , and a particular maximum size for the matrix , @xmath35 , it is now a simple matter of evaluating the matrix elements and substituting into eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) .",
    "we rewrite this equation in dimensionless units : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 where @xmath47    figure  2 shows an example of the calculation with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "several characteristics should be noted .",
    "the exact results , @xmath50 , are given by the square symbols .",
    "they are of course all negative , though they become more difficult to distinguish from zero as @xmath51 increases .",
    "the cross - hairs represent the result of our numerical calculation . only the first six values of the energy are negative , and of these , the first four are very accurate ; the remainder become positive and in fact approach the results expected from an infinite square well potential of width @xmath16 .",
    "for such large values of @xmath51 the coulomb potential becomes a minor perturbation compared to to the infinite square well . by examining the diagonal matrix elements only for large values of @xmath51 , one can derive @xmath52 where @xmath53 is euler s constant .",
    "this result is indicated with a curve in fig .  2 and provides remarkably accurate results ( contrast with the @xmath54 curve also shown ) , even for rather low values of @xmath51 .",
    "while this analytical result has nothing to do with the pure coulomb potential it does provide an opportunity to illustrate first order perturbation theory .",
    "a summary of the effects of the square well cutoff and the matrix truncation size are best presented in tabular form , since the differences are so minute .",
    "table  1 shows results as a function of the matrix size , @xmath35 , for a given @xmath55 . in this instance",
    "the third eigenvalue is always positive , i.e. the square well is narrow enough that what would normally be the third bound state is pushed into the positive regime by the existence of the outer wall at @xmath15 .",
    "note that the first two bound states , tabulated in table 1 , do converge to a definite value as @xmath35 increases , but that this value is not necessarily the value pertaining to the coulomb potential , without the embedding square well potential . in this case , this is especially true for @xmath56 , which should have a value of @xmath57 , but actually converges to a value of @xmath58 .",
    "if we did nt know beforehand that the expected values were @xmath59 and @xmath60 , then the way to check this is to increase the well width until we achieve convergence in the energies as a function of _ both _ @xmath43 and @xmath35 .",
    "tables 2 and 3 illustrate this process .",
    "it is clear that for sufficiently large @xmath43 the embedding potential plays no role ( as is desirable ) _ for a sufficiently large matrix size cutoff_. in fact , for a specific cutoff , say @xmath61 , then it is clear that as the size of the square well , @xmath43 , increases , the accuracy for a given energy level _ actually decreases_. the reason for this is as stated earlier ; for larger @xmath43 the same basis state ( say , @xmath62 ) has less spatial resolution than the @xmath63 basis state for a smaller value of @xmath43 .",
    "results for @xmath55 . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the presence of an exponentially decaying factor in the @xmath64 integral does not make the ( numerical ) integration any harder than in the coulomb case ; moreover , for most parameter choices converged results will be obtained without requiring @xmath43 to be excessively large . in fig .",
    "5 we show results for the energies of the @xmath65-states ; symbols indicate previous results,@xcite which are in excellent agreement with our own .",
    "table 4 shows more digits for the ground state energies as a function of the screening parameter @xmath66 , and indeed illustrates the remarkable accuracy of the results of ref .",
    "we have kept @xmath43 and @xmath35 fixed at @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "this is the reason for the very slight deterioration in our values for larger @xmath66 ; we can readily achieve further accuracy by increasing the infinite square well width , but at some point this would become prohibitively time - comsuming . as @xmath66 increases ( for fixed @xmath69 ) , the bound state energy approaches zero , and the wave function is more extended , and hence a large value of @xmath16 is required to maintain the same accuracy .",
    "note , however , that we are demonstrating that we can achieve any desired accuracy ; for example , with @xmath70 , we require only @xmath71 to achieve better than @xmath72 accuracy in the energy .",
    "figure  5 also illustrates graphically how quickly the infinite number of bound states become reduced to a very small number as @xmath66 increases . a critical value , @xmath73 , beyond which _",
    "no _ bound states exist , clearly exists near @xmath74 , about which we will say more below",
    ".    as before one can obtain wave functions ; when screening is present , given the same energy ( by increasing @xmath75 as @xmath66 increases ) the wave functions are more localized around the origin .",
    "figure  6 shows a comparison of such wave functions ; in each case we have adjusted the value of @xmath75 to always maintain @xmath76 .",
    "the biggest impact occurs near the origin , as the screened wave functions have considerably more amplitude there .",
    "conversely , we can examine how the ground state wave functions evolve with increasing @xmath66 with the strength maintained at @xmath69 .",
    "then , the main effect will be that the energy approaches zero , so that the wave function is increasingly ` less bound ' as @xmath66 increases . thus ,",
    "even though the interaction is more screened , and therefore shorter ranged , the wave function will spread out .",
    "figure  7 bears this out ; as @xmath66 increases the wave functions become more extended , as expected . for @xmath77 ( for the given value of @xmath48 used in fig",
    ".  7 ) the wave function extends over the entire space allowed by the infinite square well , and the shape is essentially that of a triangle in @xmath9 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is determined through normalization .",
    "the first factor is required to ensure that @xmath80 is zero .",
    "we find that @xmath81 gives a remarkably good fit to the numerically attained wave function ( it would be indistinguishable from the numerical result in fig .",
    "finally , we wish to determine how to establish the critical value , @xmath73 , above which no bound states exist .",
    "we proceed as in the case of the finite spherical well , and determine the critical value @xmath73 as a function of the infinite square well width , @xmath43 .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .  8 , and we determine , using the lowest two points ( the most reliable ) to extrapolate to @xmath82 , that @xmath83 , in agreement with previous determinations.@xcite",
    "in this paper we have shown how one can use matrix mechanics , with the simplest of bases , to successfully obtain very accurate numerical results for the low - lying levels for essentially any three dimensional potential arising from central forces that supports bound states .",
    "the mathematics required to do this is minimal , but students must be able to use any number of existing software packages to numerically diagonalize the resulting matrix .",
    "this skillset , non - existent a generation ago , is becoming increasingly useful for an undergraduate physics degree and beyond .",
    "both bound state energies and wave functions can be readily obtained with the methodology described here . by increasing the size of the basis ( and , if necessary , the size of the embedding infinite square well potential to accommodate the spatial spread of the bound state )",
    "one can achieve any desired accuracy .",
    "results were demonstrated for the coulomb , spherical well , and yukawa potentials .",
    "we also addressed more difficult issues , such as the existence of critical parameters ( well depth , or screening length ) beyond which bound states cease to exist .",
    "we were able to reproduce the textbook result for the critical attractive potential for the spherical well , along with the not so well known result for the critical screening parameter in the case of the yukawa potential .",
    "the properties of many other potentials used in the research literature are now accessible to undergraduates ; studies of these potentials are suitable for assignments and/or projects .",
    "this work was supported in part by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) , and by the teaching and learning enhancement fund ( tlef ) and a mccalla fellowship at the university of alberta .",
    "most students will opt to use a high level language like matlab , mathematica , or maple to solve problems as formulated in this paper . only a few lines of code are required in this case .",
    "we have used @xmath84 and fortran , and here we write down the key parts of the code required , in fortran .",
    "we use a simple trapezoidal rule to evaluate the integrals required for the hamiltonian matrix elements , and call upon two subroutines from numerical recipes@xcite to diagonalize the matrix .",
