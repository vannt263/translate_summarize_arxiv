    "in 1971 manfred eigen published a seminal paper on the evolution of error - prone self - replicating macromolecules @xcite .",
    "his theory was expanded significantly later on , primarily in works of eigen , schuster and co - workers @xcite .",
    "one of the principal findings was the existence of the _ error threshold _ , i.e. , the critical mutation rate such that the equilibrium population of macromolecules ( the _ quasispecies _ in the terminology of eigen et al . ) can not provide conditions for evolution if the fidelity of copying falls below this critical level .",
    "this critical mutation rate depends on the length of macromolecules and hence puts limits on the amount of information that can be carried by a given macromolecule . to improve fidelity",
    "one needs longer sequences ( e.g. , a more efficient replicase ) , to have longer sequences one needs better fidelity , hence the chicken  egg problem .",
    "an easy and obvious solution to this problem is that the early primordial genomes must have consisted of independently replicating entities , which , generally speaking , would compete with each other ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    if we consider a simple mathematical description of independent competing replicators then the usual differential equations for the growth take the following form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the concentration of the @xmath2-th type of macromolecules , @xmath3 is the rate of replicating , @xmath4 is the degree of auto - catalysis , and @xmath5 is the term which is necessary to keep the total concentration constant , this term depends only on @xmath6 and not on the index , @xmath7 in the present case ; easy to see that this is equivalent to the condition @xmath8 . in the case if @xmath9 we have system with non - linear growth rates , which model different coupling strength of the various components , for the discussion of such growth rates see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "hereinbelow we consider mainly @xmath4 ( or even , @xmath10 ) but remark that @xmath11 gives the exponential growth , @xmath12 gives the standard hyperbolic growth ( autocatalysis ) , and for @xmath13 the parabolic growth occurs @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that for @xmath14 only one replicator present at @xmath15 , the competition winds up in the _ competitive exclusion _ of all but one types , i.e. , the genome composed of independently replicating entities is not vital .",

    "it is known that is _ permanent _ , i.e. , all the concentrations are separated from zero , and hence different replicators coexist in this model .",
    "more exactly , for short hypercycles , @xmath24 , the internal equilibrium is globally stable , for longer hypercycles , @xmath25 , a globally stable limit cycle appears  @xcite .",
    "the problem with the hypercycle model is its vulnerability to the invasion of parasites @xcite .",
    "we remark that models and are systems of ordinary differential equation ( odes ) , i.e. , they are mean - field models . as a solution to the parasite invasion problem",
    "it was suggested that heterogeneous population structure can strengthen persistence of the system .",
    "one of the suggested solution was spatially explicit models @xcite , see also @xcite for reviews of the pertinent work .",
    "two major approaches to spatially explicit models are reaction - diffusion equations and cellular automata models , and they both were considered in the cited works . which was lacking",
    ", however , is an analytical treatment of the resulting systems , because in both cases the researchers have resorted to extensive numerical simulations .",
    "an only notable exception to our knowledge is @xcite , where some of the models with explicit space are analyzed analytically .",
    "an interest in cluster - like solutions of reaction - diffusion systems resulted in the analysis of spatially explicit hypercycle in infinite space @xcite .",
    "note that models and are a special case of the general replicator equation @xcite , for which several approaches are known to incorporate an explicit spatial structure , albeit there is no universally accepted way of incorporating dispersal effects .",
    "the solution to the problem with equal diffusion rates is straightforward , in this case we , following ecological approach , can just add the laplace operator to the right hand sides of or .",
    "this was used , e.g. , in the classical paper by fisher @xcite to model the effect of the spatial structure on the invasion properties of an advantageous gene ; this approach later was generalized by hadeler @xcite . however , for the primordial world , it would be a too stringent an assumption to have all the diffusion coefficients equal . to overcome this difficulty , vickers et al .",
    "introduced a special form of the population regulation to allow for different diffusion rates @xcite , now in the subject area of evolutionary game dynamics . in these",
    "works a nonlinear term is used that provides",
    "_ local _ regulation of the populations under question , although no particular biological mechanism is known that lets individuals adapt their per capita birth and death rates to local circumstances @xcite . in our view , it is more natural to assume the _ global _ regulation of the populations , hence following along the lines of thought that brought to the models and",
    ". mathematically it means that we assume that the total populations satisfy the following condition @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a spatial variable now .",
    "this approach was first used in @xcite . which is important here is that this approach allows to obtain some analytical insights of the systems @xcite .",
    "in this text our goal is to present an analytical treatment of the models of prebiotic macromolecules with self- and hypercyclic catalysis with an explicit spatial structure and global population regulation in the form of reaction - diffusion equations .",
