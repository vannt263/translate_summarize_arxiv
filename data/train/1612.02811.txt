    "stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) have become an area of active research over the last few decades .",
    "several classes of methods have been developed to solve spdes numerically , including finite difference schemes @xcite , finite element schemes @xcite , and stochastic taylor schemes @xcite .",
    "this article is motivated by zakai spdes of the form ( see @xcite ) , @xmath3 - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big[b(x)v(t , x)\\big]\\bigg)\\,\\mathrm{d}t - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big[\\gamma(x)v(t , x)\\big]\\,\\mathrm{d}m_t,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a standard brownian motion and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 suitably chosen coefficient functions .",
    "this zakai equation arises from a nonlinear filtering problem : given an observation process @xmath4 and a signal process @xmath8 , we want to estimate the conditional distribution of @xmath8 given @xmath4 . if @xmath8 satisfies @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath4 are independent standard brownian motions , and the distribution function has a density @xmath11 , it is proved in @xcite that @xmath11 satisfies with @xmath12 the conditional ( on @xmath4 ) distribution function is then @xmath13 and it is the goal of this article to estimate the expectation of functionals of this form .    for simplicity",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the special case @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath4 is a standard brownian motion , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are real - valued parameters .",
    "this is a special case of ( [ eq_zakai ] ) where @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 in ( [ eq_equation1 ] ) describes the limit empirical measure , as @xmath19 , of a large exchangeable particle system @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent standard brownian motions .",
    "a direct application of this model is the large portfolio credit model @xcite . assume the market consists of @xmath23 different firms where @xmath24 are `` distance - to - default '' processes . then the functional of interest is the loss @xmath25 i.e. , the mass lost at the absorbing boundary . in the credit risk application of @xcite",
    ", @xmath26 describes the loss in a structural credit model , i.e. , the fraction of firms whose values have crossed zero and which are considered defaulted .",
    "the values of credit products are often functions of the loss @xmath27 .    generally , the solution to ( [ eq_zakai ] ) is not known analytically and has to be approximated numerically .",
    "a survey of methods is given in @xcite , and we focus here on recent applications of multilevel methods as they pertain to this article .",
    "giles and reisinger @xcite used an explicit milstein finite difference approximation to the solution of ( [ eq_equation1 ] ) . by using fourier analysis , this scheme can be shown to give first order of convergence in the timestep and second order in the spatial mesh size .",
    "one constraint in this paper is that the timestep needs to be small enough to ensure stability .",
    "inspired by the numerical analysis of sdes in @xcite , @xcite extended the discretisation to an implicit method on the basis of the @xmath28-@xmath29 time - stepping scheme , where the drift and the deterministic part of the double stochastic integral are taken implicit .",
    "fourier analysis shows that the convergence order is the same as in the explicit milstein scheme , however , this scheme is unconditionally mean - square stable under a constraint on the correlation @xmath30 in  .",
    "this unconditional stability is essential for our application as detailed below .    in this paper",
    ", we compare a new multi - index monte carlo ( mimc ) scheme in the spirit of @xcite , with the multilevel monte carlo ( mlmc ) method of @xcite .",
    "the mlmc method utilises a sequence of approximations @xmath31 to a random variable @xmath32 with increasing accuracy but also higher cost for increasing @xmath33 . in the simulation of an sde",
    ", @xmath33 would typically be the refinement level of the time mesh , with @xmath34 time steps .",
    "the mlmc estimator is based on recursive control variates embedded in the identity @xmath35 = \\mathbb{e}\\big[p_0\\big ] + \\sum_{l=1}^{l^\\ast}\\mathbb{e}\\big[p_l - p_{l-1}\\big],\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a maximum refinement level .",
    "the goal is to estimate @xmath37 $ ] by independent estimation of the summands , in a way that the root mean square error ( rmse ) is comparable to the bias , but with a much reduced computational complexity .",
    "if fewer samples are needed for higher levels , the total computational cost is much lower than when using the standard monte carlo method ( see theorem 1 in @xcite ) . in a second step",
    ", @xmath36 is adapted for a given rmse target .",
    "the mlmc method has been extended to spdes , in which case it gives even better savings due to the additional spatial dimensions .",
    "giles and reisinger @xcite applied mlmc to simulate the spde   and the functional of its solution given in  . both timestep @xmath38 and mesh size @xmath39 decrease geometrically on different levels of refinement @xmath40 , with fixed @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the variance of the estimators for @xmath42 $ ] is small for large @xmath33 , compared to the estimator for @xmath43 $ ] . as a result , for a fixed accuracy @xmath1",
    ", the cost can be reduced significantly to @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 by the standard monte carlo estimator .",
    "the approach taken here is to approximate this spde by multi - index monte carlo simulation as introduced in @xcite .",
    "the goal of mimc is to improve the total complexity for higher - dimensional problems , where the cost of each sample on higher levels increases faster than the variance of mlmc estimators decays , such that the optimal complexity of @xmath44 is lost in mlmc .",
    "multi - index monte carlo can be viewed as a combination of sparse grids @xcite and mlmc methods .",
    "the level @xmath46 is now a vector of integer indices , corresponding to the refinement level in the different dimensions .",
    "sparse grids , and hence mimc , use high order mixed differences instead of only taking first order differences to construct a hierarchical approximation . more specifically , for a @xmath47-dimensional problem , @xcite first defines first order difference operators @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the unit vector in direction @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the estimator of level @xmath53 .",
    "then the telescoping sum becomes @xmath54 = \\sum_{\\bm{l } \\in \\mathbb{n}^d}\\mathbb{e}\\bigg[\\bigg(\\prod_{i=1}^d\\delta_i\\bigg)p_{\\bm{l}}\\bigg].\\ ] ] the strategy is to neglect terms with large @xmath53 where the cost is large and the contribution to the estimator is small .",
    "instead of choosing an index @xmath36 as in mlmc , one now has to choose an index set @xmath55 of terms to include .",
    "the main selling point of mimc methods applied to higher - dimensional spdes , similar to sparse grid methods for high - dimensional pdes , is that they can give a computational complexity with a fixed polynomial order multiplied by a log term , with an exponent which grows with the dimension @xmath47 .",
    "both the sparse grid combination technique and the mimc framework are based on certain specific expansions of the discretisation error in the mesh parameters .",
    "these have been proven for a growing class of pdes @xcite ; @xcite studies pdes with random coefficients and refers to these pde results in a path - wise sense , @xcite analyses mimc for nested simulation .    in this paper , we    * apply mimc to the spde on a space - time mesh with an implicit milstein time - stepping scheme and central spatial differences ; * demonstrate that the expectation and variance of the multi - index estimators can be analysed by fourier analysis , even if the required error expansions do not hold pathwise ; * show that an extra term appears in the error expansion which explodes for small spatial mesh sizes , but by a suitable adaptation of the mimc estimator a theoretical complexity of @xmath56 can be obtained , while the practically observed complexity is still @xmath57 as in the mlmc method @xcite ; * give a seemingly innocuous variant of this approximation scheme , i.e. , with the spatial approximation studied in @xcite , and show that the `` standard '' assumptions on the error expansion are only satisfied with lower order , such that the mimc estimator is less efficient with complexity @xmath0 ; * give an example of a discontinuous functional and a simple approximation where we show that multiple leading order error terms appear , such that the optimal index set is not triangular , and demonstrate how mimc can be adapted to this case .",
    "hence we show that although mimc can be expected to work well in multi - dimensional situations compared to mlmc , this is not always true . in this paper , we only consider cases where mlmc gives optimal complexity order .",
    "therefore , the results herein can be considered negative in the practical sense that worse performance , is obtained for mimc than mlmc .",
    "in addition to these `` negative '' results being interesting in their own right , we provide a methodology to analyse mimc estimators for a class of spdes .",
    "this method carries over to the higher - dimensional setting , where mimc has complexity advantages over mlmc ( as explained further in section [ sec_conclusion ] ) .",
    "the rest of this article is structured as follows .",
    "we define two implicit milstein finite difference schemes in section  [ sec_1dimplicitmilsteinscheme ] , and the mimc estimators in section  [ sec_1dmimcestimator ] .",
    "the main theoretical result is provided in section [ sec_1dmimcfourier ] , where we analyse the convergence order of a mimc estimator using fourier analysis .",
    "section [ sec_1doptimalindex ] gives an `` optimal index set '' for this mimc estimator and derives the total complexity for fixed accuracy .",

    "we study the parabolic stochastic partial differential equation @xmath59 where @xmath15 , @xmath4 is a standard brownian motion , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are real - valued parameters , subject to the dirac initial data @xmath60 where @xmath61 is given . a classical result states that , for a class of spdes including , with initial condition in @xmath62 , there exists a unique solution @xmath63 @xcite",

    "we can avoid the constraint on the timestep by using an implicit scheme instead @xcite .",
    "two implicit milstein finite difference discretisations are conceivable for the spde :    1 .",
    "discretise the spatial derivatives first , then apply the milstein scheme to the resulting system of sdes , i.e. , @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "2 .   apply the milstein scheme first , then discretise the spatial derivatives .",
    "this gives @xmath87    these two schemes have the same effect on the multilevel algorithm , and is used in @xcite .",
    "however , we will show that is less efficient using the multi - index algorithm , as these two schemes result in different orders of variance for the mimc estimators .",
    "since the scheme is more efficient , we will explore it in detail in section [ sec_1dmimcfourier ] , and the analysis of in section  [ sec_1dalternative ] is then similar .",

    "although mlmc has already achieved optimal complexity in this case , one shortcoming of mlmc is that the efficiency still depends on the dimensionality . for high - dimensional problems , when the level increases",
    ", the decay of the variance will be slower than the increase of the cost . in that case",
    ", the total computational cost is no longer @xmath44 .",
    "for example , consider a two - dimensional version of the spde , @xmath437 with @xmath438 , @xmath439 $ ] , @xmath440 real parameters . assuming second order convergence in both spatial directions and first order in time , the total mlmc cost given a fixed accuracy @xmath1 is expected to be @xmath441 .",
    "although this is much lower than the @xmath442 expected for the standard monte carlo method , the order is not optimal as in the one - dimensional case .",
    "further work will include analysing high - dimensional spdes using the mimc method .",
    "preliminary results suggest that mimc achieves a better complexity than the multilevel method .    another further research is to apply an absorbing boundary condition to this zakai type spde @xcite .",
    "now the particle system involves a barrier such that once the particle touches the barrier , the value would be zero afterwards .",
    "then the density process of the system satisfies a spde with a zero boundary condition .",
    "specifically , for the one - dimensional spde , it becomes @xmath443 the solution has a smooth density process and shows degeneracy near the absorbing boundary @xcite . in this case",
    ", the convergence order of the finite difference scheme does not follow from the fourier analysis of the unbounded case .",
    "the analysis of this type of spde with boundary conditions is still an open area for research , especially for higher dimensions .",
