    "inflation is currently the standard paradigm for solving the flatness , horizon and the unwanted topological relic problems in standard big bang cosmology . in addition",
    ", the quantum fluctuation of the inflaton field provides the seeds of inhomogeneity that seem to fit very well with the current observation on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure ( lss ) . a particularly important probe of the physics of inflation is provided by primordial gravitational waves ( tensor fluctuations ) .",
    "a number of observational searches for gravitational wave perturbations are proposed or are currently underway ; these may be probed through the b - mode polarization of the cmb @xcite or , on smaller scales , through interferometers such as ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , decigo @xcite , einstein telescope @xcite , or lisa @xcite .    during inflation ,",
    "gravitational wave fluctuations are inevitably generated by quantum fluctuations of the tensor part of the metric .",
    "these have an amplitude controlled by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the hubble scale and @xmath2 .",
    "the gravitational wave signal from vacuum fluctuations is detectable only when the inflaton field range is trans - planckian @xcite , which might be challenging to realize in a controlled effective field theory .",
    "additional sources of gravitational waves ( gw ) , which are uncorrelated with the usual quantum vacuum fluctuations , may be present in the early universe ( see , for instance , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "two broad categories of mechanisms are :    1 .",
    "* models involving phase transitions : * for example , in first order phase transitions , vacuum bubble collisions @xcite and the subsequent turbulence @xcite could source gw . the generation and decay of cosmic strings can also give rise to large gw @xcite .",
    "along similar lines , the self - ordering of a scalar field after a second order phase transition has also been considered @xcite .",
    "* models involving particle production : * generically the inflaton should be expected to couple to some additional degrees of freedom , as would seem to be necessary for successful reheating @xcite . in this case",
    ", there is a natural possibility that the time - dependence of the inflaton condensate during inflation leads to the production of some other degrees of freedom which may , in turn , provide an important new source of gw @xcite .",
    "a variety of different models have been proposed ; see below for more discussion .",
    "given the importance of gravitational waves as a probe of inflation , it is important to understand if such mechanisms could be competitive with the usual spectrum of gw from vacuum fluctuations .     any mechanism which is being invoked to source gravitational waves might also source scalar metric perturbations .",
    "therefore , one must take care not to spoil the usual prediction of a nearly scale invariant spectrum of gaussian scalar curvature perturbations .",
    "sometimes this concern is evaded by restricting attention to effects that take place on the small scales relevant for interferometers where the scalar fluctuations are not strongly constrained . in this work",
    "we will mostly be interested in models of particle production during inflation , where gravitational waves are sourced on cmb scales . to test the feasibility of such scenarios ,",
    "it is crucial to study also the spectrum and bispectrum of the scalar fluctuations , to ensure that these are consistent with observations .",
    "models of particle production during inflation have received considerable attention in the literature ; see for example @xcite .",
    "one class of models involves instantaneous bursts of particle production , leading to localized features in the cosmological perturbations .",
    "early studies focused on the production of fermion @xcite or scalar @xcite particles , neglecting the feed - back of the produced quanta on the perturbations of the inflaton . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was however shown that this feed - back effect actually dominates observables for the case of scalar particle production . ref .",
    "@xcite considered a simple model where scalar @xmath3 particles are produced through a coupling @xmath4 to the inflaton , @xmath5 , using both lattice field theory simulations and also analytical methods .",
    "models of this same type were subsequently analyzed in the context of trapped inflation @xcite .",
    "more recently , models of instantaneous vector particle production have been studied in connection with gw at interferometer scales @xcite .",
    "several scenarios of gw from scalar and string production were instead studied in @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that particle production occurs continuously during inflation .",
    "this is quite natural in the context of axion inflation @xcite . even in the simplest models of inflation driven by a single axion in slow roll on a smooth flat potential , pseudoscalar couplings @xmath6 to gauge fields are ubiquitous",
    "this interaction leads to a continuous tachyonic production of gauge field fluctuations during inflation .",
    "there are a host of interesting phenomenological signatures : observable equilateral non - gaussianity @xcite , gw at interferometer scales @xcite , and excess power at small scales @xcite .",
    "additionally , backreaction effects in such models can assist inflation by dissipating the kinetic energy of the inflaton @xcite , analogously to warm inflation @xcite and trapped inflation @xcite .   in  @xcite a model of gauge field production through the scalar coupling @xmath7 was considered , in connection with primordial non - gaussianity and , perhaps , magnetogenesis ( this last application is problematic @xcite ) .",
    "above we discussed some simple models of particle production during inflation where quanta are produced by a _",
    "direct coupling _ between the inflaton and some additional degrees of freedom . in such a scenario",
    "the produced particles interact with the inflaton through couplings that are typically much stronger than gravitational .",
    "hence , these produced particles will tend to source scalar curvature fluctuations much more efficiently than gw .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore , that the most stringent cmb constraints on such models often come from features and non - gaussianity in the scalar fluctuations , rather than from gw .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the possibility to source a significant gw signal on cmb scales without ruining the spectrum of curvature fluctuations . to minimize the impact on the inflaton fluctuations , we assume that particle production takes place in a `` hidden '' sector that is only gravitationally coupled to the inflaton .",
    "we compute for the first time the scalar perturbations induced by the gravitational coupling , and we compare their phenomenological impact with that of the produced gw",
    ". since gravitational interactions are unavoidable , the case we investigate can be thought of as a kind of `` best case '' scenario for the production of gw while minimizing the effect on the scalar fluctuations .",
    "concretely , we will focus on two models involving the production of spin-@xmath8 particles :    1 .",
    "* model i : * particle production takes place in a hidden sector where a local @xmath9 invariance is spontaneously broken by the expectation value of some complex scalar @xmath10 . here",
    "gauge fields are produced at an isolated moment - namely , when the mass of the gauge field crosses zero during the evolution of @xmath10 - and we have localized features in the scalar spectrum and bispectrum , in addition to a localized feature in the tensor spectrum . for a single isolated burst of production ,",
    "we find that observational constraints on the scalar perturbations exclude any interesting effect in gw . however , in a concrete model there may be many bursts of particle production and their resonance could enhance the effect .",
    "we note that this model could lead to interesting phenomenological signatures in the scalar fluctuations ; localized features in the spectrum and bispectrum are discussed .",
    "* model ii : * particle production takes place in a hidden sector where a rolling pseudoscalar sources gauge field fluctuations continuously . here",
    "we find that gw from particle production can be competitive with the vacuum fluctuations , or even larger than the vacuum fluctuations , _ without _ violating observational bounds on non - gaussianity . in this model",
    "the primordial tensor spectrum can be detectable for _ any _ choice of inflaton potential ( that is , also for small field inflation ) . in this model , gw from particle production are chiral .",
    "we show that parity violation in the tensor sector can be almost maximal , which provides a distinctive observable signature of this scenario ; see also @xcite .    in summary",
    ": we find that the possibility to source interesting gw from particle production is rather model dependent .",
    "even if particle production occurs in a hidden sector , coupled only gravitationally to the inflationary one , this is not a sufficient condition to ensure that observable gw can be sourced without ruining the scalar spectrum . on the other hand , we find that in some models gw from particle production can actually _ exceed _ the usual vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the reason for the smaller gw production in model i with respect to model ii is that in model i the gauge quanta are highly non - relativistic after their production , which suppresses their quadrupole moment .",
    "we verified that the same suppression takes place if , instead of gauge fields , the particles produced in this mechanism have spins @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "as we mentioned , a greater gw effect may be obtained for multiple instances of particle production , or for a more complicated evolution of the gauge field mass , or if the massive particles decay into massless ones short after they are produced @xcite .",
    "therefore , due to the possibility of gw from particle production , a measurement of primordial b - modes does not necessarily constitute a measurement of the scale of inflation . nor does a detectable b - mode signal necessarily require super - planckian excursions in field space .",
    "fortunately , as we discuss below , the produced gw may be distinguished from the vacuum signal , either by their localization at some given wavelength ( assuming that model i can be modified so to enhance the gw signal ) , or by their violation of parity .    in terms of observational prospects of gravitational waves on cmb scales ,",
    "model ii is certainly more promising , as the gauge quanta are automatically relativistic and their quadrupole moment is not suppressed . while the focus of the present work is to examine the signatures and constraints of gravitational waves produced during inflation as a result of hidden sector particle production , the uv sensitivity of inflation motivates us to ask whether such models can be realized in string theory .",
    "indeed , the 4d low energy spectrum of string theory contains a myriad of axion - like fields , e.g. , those arise from the reduction of antisymmetric form fields on cycles of the internal space .",
    "these closed string axions couple to @xmath9 gauge fields on the worldvolume of d - branes via @xmath13 couplings .",
    "the axion decay constant @xmath14 one typically finds in string theory constructions is of the order of the gut scale @xmath15 gev ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) which sits comfortably within the allowed window for consistency of our model ( see eqs .",
    "( [ total_bnd ] ) and ( [ bnd2-f ] ) ) .",
    "it is not difficult to arrange the inflaton to have no direct coupling to the axion and the gauge field .",
    "we outline some ideas to realize model ii in string theory in the concluding section .",
    "we leave , however , a detailed study of these and other string theory embeddings for future work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : formal ] we develop a very general formalism which can be used to compute the effects of particle production on the scalar and tensor cosmological perturbation in a variety of models . in section [ sec : model1 ] we apply this formalism to model i , discussed above . in section [ sec : model2 ] we instead apply our formalism to model ii , discussed above . in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we conclude . in appendix",

    "we assume that quanta of a vector field are produced ( either at some discrete moment @xmath16 , or throughout inflation ) in a sector only gravitationally coupled to the inflaton .",
    "we are interested in computing scalar and tensor cosmological perturbations sourced by the vector quanta .",
    "the vector field can be decomposed as @xmath17   \\label{a - deco}\\ ] ] where we have included only the transverse vector polarization ( in section [ sec : model1 ] we actually study also the longitudinal polarization , as it is present , and may be relevant , in that model ) . here",
    "@xmath18 are circular polarization vectors satisfying @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and normalized according to + @xmath22 .    in this section ,",
    "we introduce the formalism for the correlators of the scalar and tensor perturbations sourced by this vector vector , under the assumption that the latter is only gravitationally coupled to the inflationary sector , and that it enters quadratically in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the discussion is divided in three parts ; in subsection [ subsec : formal - deco ] we present the structure of the equations for the scalar and tensor perturbations in presence of the source ; in subsection [ subsec : formal - sol ] we present the formal solutions , and the structures of the correlators ; in subsection [ subsec : formal - pheno ] we show how these expressions enter in observable quantities .",
    "we compute scalar cosmological perturbations in the spatially flat gauge @xmath24 . in this gauge ,",
    "the curvature perturbation @xmath25 is ( up to negligible corrections , as we will see in the next two sections ) @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the unperturbed and perturbed part of the inflaton , respectively .   and conformal time by @xmath29 .",

    "a difficulty with this idea is that the same particle production will also source scalar perturbations ; the observed scalar perturbations have properties in perfect agreement with standard vacuum fluctuations generated by the simplest inflationary model ; in particular , they are gaussian to a very high degree , while there is no reason to expect that this should be the case for a generic model of particle production .",
    "therefore , any mechanism of gravity waves from inflation needs to explain why the mechanism has not already manifested itself in the scalar sector .    to evade this problem",
    ", @xcite studied scenarios in which the particle production takes place ( or increases at a sufficient level ) only towards the end of inflation , so to generate gravity waves only at scales much smaller than the cmb ones . at these scales , the scalar perturbations are only constrained by primordial black holes ( see for instance @xcite for a recent study ) , which is a significantly weaker bound than those from non - gaussianity at the cmb scales .",
    "one of the scenarios of @xcite was further studied in @xcite to account for the backreaction of the produced particles on the background inflaton .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in this region the sourced gravity wave signal can already be observed by the next ligo stage @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to study whether an analogous mechanism can produce an observable gravity wave signal at cmb scales , without conflicting with the limits from non - gaussianity in the scalar sector .",
    "let us denote by @xmath48 the field that is produced during inflation , and that sources the gravity waves . in the models considered in @xcite quanta of @xmath48",
    "are produced by the motion of the inflaton , which we denote by @xmath5 .",

    "on the contrary , the source of gravity waves from @xmath48 is of gravitational strength . to minimize the relative amount of produced @xmath25 vs. produced gravity waves , in this work we made the opposite assumption of considering the weakest possible coupling ( in standard gravitational theory ) between @xmath48 and the inflaton : namely , we assumed that @xmath5 and @xmath48 are coupled only gravitationally .",
    "we therefore assumed that particle production occurs in a `` hidden sector '' and in this paper , for the first time , we computed the amount of scalar perturbations @xmath25 induced by @xmath48 through a purely gravitational interaction .",
    "we then computed the amounts of gravity waves produced by @xmath48 in these two models ( for model ii , we quote existing results ) , and we compared the two effects .",
    "clearly , there is a large arbitrariness in the choice of the model for particle production , and we do not claim our findings to be exhaustive ; in particular , we did not study here the analogous of all the scenarios considered in @xcite , where for instance multiple bursts of particle production , and production of strings were also studied .",
    "we study two models in which @xmath48 is a vector field , which is produced by the motion of a field @xmath430 . in model",
    "i , the vector field has a mass term @xmath431 , and quanta of @xmath345 are produced when the classical value of @xmath10 crosses zero . in model",
    "ii the vector is continuously sourced by a pseudo - scalar @xmath432 interaction .",
    "the reasons for considering these two models is that , after the particle production , the vector quanta are highly massive in model i , while massless in model ii .",
    "we showed that in the first case this gives rise to a strong suppression of the gravity wave signal with respect to the amount of scalar perturbations . in the remainder of this concluding section ,",
    "we summarize our findings in these two models , together with some discussion .",
    "1 .   * model i : * the main signature of particle production in this model is a bump in the scalar power spectrum , at the scales that exited the horizon when the gauge quanta were produced .",
    "if this bump will be observed , this mechanism can be supported / disproved by the presence/ absence of an analogous bump in the bispectrum , which we also computed here for the first time .",
    "the spectrum of gravity waves produced by the gauge quanta also presents a peak at the same scales , which - if sufficiently high - could distinguish them from the vacuum gravity waves .",
    "however , we found that - once the bound from not having observed a large bump in the scalar spectrum is respected - the amount of gravity waves produced in this model is completely unobservable ( @xmath433 ) .",
    "the relative smallness of the gravity waves vs scalar perturbations produced in the model may come as a surprise , due to the fact that the gauge quanta are coupled gravitationally to both these quantities .",
    "the reason for the suppression is due to the fact that the quanta are highly non - relativistic after they are produced .",
    "this highly suppresses their quadrupole moment , and the amount of gravity waves that they generate .    to verify this",
    ", we also computed the amount of gravity waves produced if the vector field is replaced by a fermion , with mass @xmath434 .",
    "@xcite computed the amount of gravity waves produced by a scalar with mass @xmath434 . from our two results , and from the result of @xcite for the scalar case",
    ", we actually obtained the very general formula ( [ general - plambda - beforpint ] ) for the amount of gravity waves produced in all these cases .",
    "we see that there is no large enhancement between the different spins , apart from the proportionality of the final result to the number of degrees of freedom in each case .",
    "we did not compute the amount of scalar perturbations @xmath25 sourced in the fermionic case .",
    "however , we believe that also in this case the result will be analogous to the one that we have computed , and that therefore our conclusions on the relative importance of gravity waves vs scalar perturbations production apply for produced particles of any spin .    in this model , the vector field is massive after the production , and it therefore also possesses a longitudinal component .",
    "the results for this component are more model dependent than those of the transverse components : they depend on the specific choice of the potential @xmath435 for @xmath10 ( the results for the transverse component are independent of @xmath435 provided that it is smaller than the kinetic energy of @xmath10 during particle production ) .",
    "the longitudinal mode may drive the theory out of perturbative regime when @xmath436 .",
    "we showed that this is avoided if the ratio @xmath437 remains finite as @xmath438 .",
    "this is , for instance , the case if @xmath439 at the origin .",
    "these considerations can be relevant for all the models in which symmetries are enhanced at some point during the cosmological evolution .",
    "for instance , we expect massive gauge modes to become massless when different branes move to the same bulk location as in the trapping mechanism of @xcite .",
    "we also found that , for @xmath440 , the longitudinal component is produced as much as each transverse component , and sources the same amount of gravity waves , for the most reasonable values of the mass @xmath441 .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that our study applies to a single instance of particle production .",
    "things may be different in cases of multiple bursts of particle production ; for instance , if the potential @xmath435 does not flatten at large @xmath10 , so that @xmath10 performs oscillations about its minimum , gauge quanta will be produced at each oscillation , in a regime of parametric resonance @xcite .",
    "we have found that the gravity wave signal can reach an interesting level if the parametric resonance enhances the amount of produced quanta by a factor of @xmath442 with respect to the single episode of particle production ( @xmath399 being the slow roll parameter ) .",
    "it would be interesting to study under which conditions this value can be reached in a concrete model .    1 .",
    "* model ii : * the amount of gravity waves produced in this model was already computed in @xcite .",
    "the novel computation in this work is the amount of scalar perturbations produced in this model under the assumption that the inflaton is only gravitationally coupled to the gauge field , and the comparison of the two effects .",
    "we found that coupling the inflaton only gravitationally sufficiently suppresses the amount of scalar modes generated in this model , so that the limits from non - gaussianity are irrelevant when compared to those from gravity waves .",
    "therefore , particle production in this model can lead to gravity waves observable at the cmb scales . differently from model",
    "i , the gravity waves in this model are produced at all scales , and not just with a localized bump .",
    "however , this signal may be distinguishable from the vacuum one since one gravity wave helicity is produced in a much stronger amount than the other one , and this can lead @xcite to observable nonvanishing tb and eb correlations in the cmb @xcite .    ref .",
    "@xcite already studied whether the parity violation in the sourced gravity waves produced by this model can be observed .",
    "also in that case , the problem was to suppress the non - gaussianity of the scalar perturbations produced by the gauge field @xcite .",
    "this was overcome in @xcite by assuming the presence of @xmath413 sourcing gauge fields , or the curvaton mechanism for the generation of the scalar perturbations .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , under these assumptions , and for some values of parameters , the parity - violation signal can be above the @xmath414 detection line for a cosmic - variance limited experiment @xcite .",
    "we have seen that in our implementation of the mechanism ( namely , by assuming that the gauge field is only gravitationally coupled to the inflaton ) the parity violation can , for some choice of parameters , be observed already by the ongoing / forthcoming planck and spider experiments .",
    "we have seen that backreaction bounds from this mechanism are under control for an axion scale @xmath14 in the interval @xmath443 .",
    "interestingly , the axion decay constant one typically finds in string theory is of the order of the gut scale @xmath444 gev ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) which fits comfortably within this window .",
    "indeed , given the uv sensitivity of inflation , it is natural to ask whether one can realize our model in string theory .",
    "the low energy spectrum of string theory contains generically many axion - like particles , which arise from the reduction of antisymmetric @xmath174-form fields on @xmath174-cycles of the internal space .",
    "these closed string axions have a pseudoscalar coupling @xmath445 to @xmath9 gauge fields on the worldvolume of d - branes .. ] in such string theory setting , it is not difficult to find inflaton candidates with no direct coupling to the axion - gauge field sector .",
    "for example , the inflaton can be another axion ; the absence of direct couplings to the hidden sector follows from some topological and geometrical constraints .",
    "consider a basis of @xmath174-cycles @xmath446 , and their dual @xmath174-forms @xmath447 such that @xmath448 .",
    "two of such axions @xmath449 , @xmath450 do not have kinetic mixing if @xmath451 .",
    "the absence of direct inflaton - gauge field @xmath13 coupling is ensured by @xmath452 where @xmath453 is the @xmath454 form dual to @xmath447 , and @xmath455 is the gauge field to which the axion @xmath10 couples .",
    "in fact , the shift symmetries enjoyed by the axions may provide a natural explanation for why they remain as the light dynamical fields during inflation .",
    "the modest hierarchy of masses ( see e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ mod2-cond - mpsi ] ) ) can be reasonably accommodated without necessarily assuming an  axiverse \" @xcite .",
    ", though having a hierarchy of axion masses offer more flexibilities . clearly , more model building possibilities ( with the inflaton being an axion or not ) remain to be explored .",
    "we hope to return to such string theory realizations in the future .",

    "in the model ( [ model1 ] ) the vector has also a longitudinal mode , which was disregarded in the computations performed in the main text .",

    "also , for simplicity , we disregard the expansion of the universe . as we have discussed in the main text , this is a good approximation as long as @xmath249 .",

    "we see that its equation of motion has a term that formally diverges as @xmath456 .   and @xmath462 and by eliminating @xmath458 from these equations . ]",
    "the formal reason for the divergence is that the kinetic term for the original longitudinal mode vanishes in this limit , as it appears from the relation between @xmath461 and @xmath462 ( [ act - al ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising , since a massless vector has only transverse modes .",
    "when , as in the present case , the u(1 ) symmetry is broken spontaneously , there is actually not a decrease of the number of degrees of freedom when the classical background part @xmath463 vanishes .",
    "the physical mass term in the original action is obtained from @xmath464 , and the quantity that we have denoted by @xmath246 in the main text is only related to the classical part , @xmath465 . however ,",
    "when @xmath466 , the fluctuations of @xmath83 can not be disregarded , and one does not obtain a truly massless vector mode at this point ( compare this with what would happen if @xmath246 was a hard and time dependent mass in the original theory ; in this case there would be instead a discontinuity in the number of degrees of freedom at @xmath467 ) .",
    "in short , a full study of the longitudinal sector would require going beyond the linearized theory ; this may also affect the transverse sector , since all the sectors are coupled to each other beyond the linearized level .",
    "here we use a simpler approach , and discuss under which conditions the longitudinal mode does not blow up in the linearized theory ; if this is the case , then one can expect that dealing with the full theory is unnecessary .",
    "we note that these considerations apply for a general class of model in which symmetries are enhanced at some point during the cosmological evolution . for instance",
    "we expect massive gauge modes to become massless when different branes move to the same bulk location as in the trapping mechanism of @xcite .",
    "using the background equations of motion , the dangerous factor @xmath468 in the linearized computation ( [ act - al ] ) rewrites @xmath469 where the first two equations are exact , and in the final step we instead disregard the expansion of the universe .",
    "therefore , the equation of motion of @xmath461 remain finite provided that @xmath470 does not diverge .",
    "this could be for instance the case for a quadratic potential @xmath471 for @xmath472 . in our computations",
    ", we assumed a constant @xmath473 , corresponding to @xmath474 . as we discussed in the main text , this implies that the gauge fields are produced during the time interval @xmath475 around @xmath476 .",
    "then , for a quadratic potential , imposing that the potential energy gained by @xmath349 during this interval is smaller than its kinetic energy at @xmath16 ( so that @xmath477 can indeed be taken as constant ) amounts in requiring @xmath478 .",
    "this also ensures that the period of oscillations of @xmath349 is much greater than the time in which particle production takes place , so that one can indeed treat @xmath118 and @xmath119 as constant when computing the amount of perturbations sourced by the gauge modes .    using ( [ act - al ] ) , we computed the occupation number of longitudinal vector modes with @xmath471 , and @xmath478 .",
    "we found that in this regime the longitudinal mode is produced in essentially the same amount as each transverse vector mode ( for instance , we found that for @xmath479 the total number densities of the longitudinal and of one transverse polarization differ from each other by less than @xmath480 ) .",
    "we stress however that this conclusion is model dependent , as the precise evolution of the effective frequency in ( [ act - al ] ) depends on the details of @xmath348 . on the contrary ,",
    "the amounts of the transverse modes produced is independent of @xmath435 , provided that it remains sufficiently smaller than the kinetic energy during the time of production .    in the remainder of this appendix we study the spectrum of gravity waves produced in this model ,",
