    "over the last two decades magnetic fields have been identified as the principle , universal agent for creating collimated astrophysical outflows . when a magnetic field is anchored in a rapidly rotating object near the bottom of a gravitational potential",
    ", the field can act as a drive - belt , tapping rotational kinetic energy and launching plasma back up the potential well .",
    "this magneto - rotational ( mr ) scenario for jet launching has been explored by numerous authors , both analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "these authors showed this mechanism can produce steady flows of matter , in a sense that the outflow engine still operates while the flow is observable  as in jets from young stellar objects @xcite and active galactic nuclei @xcite .    on the other hand , this mechanism can also operate in a transient event , linked to a rapid evolution of the source and driving an explosion . in this case",
    ", the engine loses a significant fraction of its power by the time the outflow ( or its interaction with the environment ) is detected . the proposed mechanism for gamma ray bursts ( grbs ; * ? ? ? * ) and supernovae ( sne ) , lie in the explosive regime . there is also growing evidence @xcite that collimated outflows from planetary nebulae ( pns ) are explosive .",
    "transient mr explosions have not been explored in as much detail as the steady - state models . in a collapsing star , differential rotation near",
    "the core may amplify the field linearly ( when turbulence is unimportant ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or exponentially ( when turbulence is important ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when differential rotation twists a poloidal magnetic field , generating toroidal field @xmath0 , enough rotational energy may be tapped to power a supernova explosion .",
    "the role of toroidal field pressure in then driving an outflow has been highlighted by @xcite , who explored magneto - static `` magnetic towers '' to understand jet properties ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xcite has extended this work to exploding stars .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite and more recently by @xcite support the idea that mr explosions can be important for driving sne and grbs .",
    "however , the inherent time - dependence and general complexity of the system presents a significant challenge to our understanding of the basic mechanism and identification of key parameters .",
    "it is clear that a mr explosion is ultimately driven by the rotational kinetic energy extracted from the material that is left behind ( the stellar remnant ) .",
    "but , notably , there is still some uncertainty as to whether an accretion disk must form inside the star ( as in * ? ? ? * ) or whether the rotation of the stellar core ( e.g. , a protopulsar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) alone will drive a mr explosion .    in this letter , we present a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation of a mr explosion . while our setup is simple , similar to the analytical `` protopulsar jet '' model described by @xcite , our simulation captures the nonlinear dynamics , as the magnetic field",
    "is twisted at the shear layer between the core and envelope .",
    "this heuristic approach enables a better understanding of the basic mr physics and complements the more phenomenological approach of previous , more complex , numerical studies .",
    "the model consists of a gravitating , magnetized sphere ( the `` core , '' representing a stellar core ) surrounded by an overlying envelope .",
    "the core is solid in a sense that no mass flows in or out of the surface , and it rotates as a solid body .",
    "the core is also a conductor with a rotation - axis - aligned dipole magnetic field anchored to the surface .",
    "this magnetic field couples to the envelope , whose behavior is characterized by the ideal mhd equations .",
    "this core - envelope model approximates the conditions in the interior of a star where there is a very steep density gradient , for example in the proximity of a nearly degenerate core in an evolved star .",
    "there is an implicit assumption that the envelope self - gravity is negligible .",
    "we assume an initial state in which the envelope is not rotating and rests in hydrostatic equilibrium , and whose density falls of as @xmath1 .",
    "the initial dipole magnetic field is force - free and permeates the envelope . at a time",
    "defined as @xmath2 = 0 in the simulations , the core begins rotating at a constant rate of 10% of the escape speed .",
    "this initiates a shear at the boundary between the surface of the core and the base of the envelope .",
    "this strong initial shear and purely poloidal magnetic field approximates the conditions in a real star immediately following an abrupt change in structure , such as a core collapse ( or envelope expansion ) .",
    "if the collapse is rapid enough , @xmath0 subsequently amplified at the core - envelope interface will be much stronger than @xmath0 generated elsewhere before the collapse , and the envelope rotation will be negligible .",
    "the envelope is unlikely to be at rest following such a change , and any bulk motion could quantitatively ( but not qualitatively ) change our results .",
    "for example , the ram pressure of an infalling envelope would change the magnetic energy required for an explosion by approximately a factor of two . finally , the field geometry is reasonable , since pulsars and magnetic white dwarfs are thought to have dipolar fields ( though tilted with respect to their rotation axes ) .",
    "the poloidal magnetic field connecting the core to the envelope is twisted by the shear , generating an azimuthal component to the magnetic field , @xmath0 , near the interface , which increases approximately linearly in time . the magnetic pressure force associated with @xmath3",
    "will be directed generally outward from the core , so when @xmath0 becomes dynamically important , the field will expand , driving the ionized envelope material in front of it .",
    "if the expansion is powerful enough , it can be explosive and drive off the entire envelope .",
    "we intentionally inhibit any sort of wind from the surface of the core , so the outflow in this explosion is composed of material that originally overlies the core ( i.e. , envelope material ) .",
    "the flow thus depends on the initial conditions existing above the surface of the core and is inherently a transient phenomenon .",
    "this contrasts with any steady - state wind theory whose solution depends only on the boundary conditions at the wind driving source .",
    "the key parameters in the system are the initial magnetic , rotational kinetic , gravitational potential , and thermal energy densities near the core - envelope interface .",
    "it is instructive to compare the characteristic speeds associated with these energies , namely the alfvn speed [ @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dipole field strength at the equator of the core and @xmath6 is the mass density at the base of the envelope ] , rotation speed at the equator ( @xmath7 ) , escape speed at the core surface ( @xmath8 ) , and sound speed at the base of the envelope ( @xmath9 ) , respectively .",
    "the assumption of initial hydrostatic equilibrium couples the thermal energy to the potential energy , effectively reducing the number of free parameters ( by requiring the initial @xmath10 ) .",
    "also , since the simulations can be scaled to any system with similar ratios of energies , there are only two fundamental parameters , which can be cast as the dimensionless velocity ratios @xmath11 and @xmath12 . here",
    ", we present results from a simulation with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the key parameter that determines whether or not the envelope will be driven off is @xmath15 .",
    "we have run a limited parameter study thus far ( not presented in this letter ) , which suggests the threshold for explosion occurs near @xmath16 .",
    "the model presented here has @xmath17 .",
    "we employ the 2.5-dimensional mhd code of @xcite , and the reader can find details of the code there and also in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the code , solves the ideal ( non - resistive ) mhd equations using a two - step lax - wendroff , finite difference scheme @xcite in cylindrical @xmath18 geometry .",
    "the formulation of the equations allows for a polytropic equation of state ( we adopt @xmath19 ) , includes a source term in the momentum and energy equations for point - source gravity , and assumes axisymmetry ( @xmath20 = 0 for all quantities ) .",
    "the computational domain consists of five nested grids ( or `` boxes '' ) in the cylindrical @xmath21-@xmath22 plane .",
    "each box contains @xmath23 gridpoints ( in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively ) with constant grid spacing .",
    "the boxes are nested concentrically , so that the inner ( first ) box represents the smallest domain at the highest resolution .",
    "the next outer box represents twice the domain size with half the spatial resolution ( an so on for other boxes ) .",
    "the simulation ended before the explosion propagated beyond the fourth box .",
    "a circular boundary with a radius of 30.5 gridpoints and centered on the origin represents the surface of the core .",
    "thus , the innermost box has a spatial resolution of 0.033 core radii , @xmath24 , and a domain size of 13.1 @xmath24 , and the fourth box has a resolution and domain size of 0.26 @xmath24 and 105 @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we use standard outflow conditions on the outer box boundaries , appropriate for wind studies .",
    "we also use standard boundary conditions on the rotation axis ( @xmath25 ) and reflection symmetry on the equator ( @xmath26 )",
    ". the simulation domain , then , consists of a @xmath21-@xmath22 slice through a single quadrant .",
    "the surface of the core is represented by a circular inner boundary , centered at the origin ( @xmath27 ) . here ,",
    "we enforce boundary conditions on a three gridcell layer , and we have performed several tests to ensure that this inner boundary behaves as appropriate for the surface of a solid , rotating , conducting and magnetized sphere .    for the current study ,",
    "we initialize the entire computational domain with a spherically symmetric hydrostatic envelope , whose density falls off as @xmath1 ( where @xmath28 is the spherical radius ) .",
    "the envelope is initially stagnant ( no rotation or motion ) and is threaded everywhere by a dipole magnetic field that is anchored to the core , as shown in the upper left panel of figure [ fig_baseseq_close ] .",
    "at the start of the simulations , the dipolar magnetic field begins to wrap up . for the chosen parameters , @xmath0 becomes dynamically important after a few tenths of a rotation of the core .",
    "the panels of figure [ fig_baseseq_close ] show the evolution during the first 4.5 rotations of the core .",
    "the expansion of newly generated @xmath0 is evident , as it drives the envelope material outward .",
    "this also expands the poloidal magnetic field ( lines ) , though some field lines near the equator remain closed , where material is forced and held in corotation with the core .",
    "the region near the core is evacuated by the expansion of the magnetic field , indicative of a transient event , rather than the beginning of a steady wind .",
    "figure [ fig_baseseq_far ] shows the density in the system after 4.5 rotations of the core , on a scale that is 10 times larger than in figure [ fig_baseseq_close ] , and the data have been reflected about the rotation axis and equator to better illustrate the flow . in the figure , one sees a high - density swept - up shell of envelope material that is moving outward from the core and bounded by a shock .",
    "the shell has a quadrupolar shape .",
    "this symmetry is due to the coupling of the rotation to the dipole field , which produces a @xmath0 that has a maximum strength at mid latitudes near the core , so magnetic pressure forces direct outward from the core , and also toward the pole and equator ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this shape can be qualitatively understood as an explosion driven by detonating two doughnut - shaped charges placed at mid latitudes around the north and south hemispheres , which results in a convergent blast wave on the equator and pole .    by 4.5 rotations of the core ,",
    "the shell material near the rotation axis and equator is traveling faster than its own internal fast magnetosonic wave speed , as well as that of the ambient envelope ahead of the shell .",
    "we expect the expansion speed of the shell to roughly correlate with @xmath29 . at 4.5 rotations",
    ", the speed of the shell near the rotation axis roughly equals this .",
    "however , the flow speed of the shell material accelerates throughout the simulation , and does not seem to reach an asymptotic velocity by the end .",
    "the simulations were stopped after 5.6 rotations of the core , since the steepening shock front began to produce numerical instabilities at that time .    the total energy ( gravitational potential plus magnetic plus kinetic plus thermal ) integrated over the entire simulation grid ( excluding the core ) increases monotonically in time and becomes positive at around 2.5 rotations .",
    "this means that there is enough energy for the entire envelope to escape from the gravitational potential well of the core .",
    "indeed , by the end of the simulations , the shell material near the axis and equator is traveling faster than the local escape speed . on the other hand ,",
    "material in the shell at mid latitudes is traveling substantially below its local escape speed .",
    "however , since this mid latitude material is still accelerating outward at the end of the simulation , and since the total energy in the system is well above zero , it appears likely that the entire envelope will escape from the core ( if the simulation were able to run long enough ) .",
    "this confirms the general picture of @xcite .",
    "in addition , the structure of the outflow suggest that , for lower @xmath30 , a partial ejection of the envelope may occur ( a `` failed '' explosion ) in which their is not only a jet ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but also an equatorial flow , leaving behind the material at mid latitudes .    finally , the magnetic field configuration after 4.5 rotations is apparent in figure [ fig_3dfar ] , where we have exploited the axisymmetry of the system to create a 3-dimensional rendering of data from the fourth simulation grid . for scale ,",
    "the outer isodensity surface corresponds to the outer edge of the shell in figure [ fig_baseseq_far ] .",
    "a comparison between figures [ fig_baseseq_far ] and [ fig_3dfar ] reveals that the `` hollow '' region interior to the dense shell is actually filled with magnetic energy , mostly due to the @xmath0 component .",
    "the shell is like a magnetically inflated `` balloon , '' which expands as the spinning core adds magnetic energy inside .",
    "thus the spin energy of the core is ultimately being transferred to the kinetic energy of the envelope ( and the core should spin down , as a result ) .",
    "the interior region is magnetically ( poynting flux ) dominated , as all material there flows more slowly than the fast magnetosonic speed .",
    "the flow along the axis is a magnetic tower jet , similar to what is seen in other simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the flow near the equatorial plane is more of a `` magnetic pancake , '' a feature of the rotating dipole field and an interesting new result of this study .",
    "our numerical setup is simple , which allows us to understand the basic physical principles at work . the requirements for the mechanism to operate are a ) a shear layer in which the inner region is rotating at a fraction of breakup speed and b ) a magnetic field that results in an alfvn speed comparable to the escape speed .",
    "because we focus on the mr mechanism , and ignore other physics ( e.g. , neutrino heating ) , we can scale our results to various astrophysical systems .",
    "this is instructive , as it determines what conditions would be necessary for a mr explosion alone to drive off the envelope . here , we briefly apply our results to the progenitor stars of sne and pns .",
    "a simple model of a core - collapse sn suggests that core material conserves magnetic flux and angular momentum during collapse and naturally forms a rapidly - rotating , highly - magnetized proto - neutron star .",
    "we adopt a neutron star ( `` core '' ) mass of 1.4 @xmath31 and a core radius of @xmath32 cm .",
    "if the overlying envelope contains 1 @xmath31 between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , our simulation corresponds to a dipole field strength at the core surface equal to @xmath35 g. note that the envelope mass is comparable to the core mass , but the self - gravity of the envelope near the core should not be important , and so the simulation still applies . in our simulation , we find that the core loses rotational energy at a constant rate of @xmath36 ergs per rotation , which should extract most of the rotational energy of the core ( @xmath37 ergs ) in 1 second .",
    "these numbers are consistent with previous work and should be sufficient to eject the envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the evolutionary phase preceding pn formation is marked by high mass loss rates , leading to an expansion of the stellar envelope , which overlies a proto - white dwarf .",
    "a shear layer at the core - envelope boundary is expected @xcite , and as the envelope density decreases , the alfvn speed should rise . there may be a threshold density , below which the remaining envelope may be expelled via a mr explosion .",
    "we adopt a white dwarf ( `` core '' ) mass of 0.5 @xmath31 , and @xmath38 cm . at this time the envelope is essentially an extension of the massive outflow , and",
    "if it contains 0.05 @xmath31 between @xmath33 and @xmath39 au , our simulation corresponds to @xmath40 g. most of the rotational energy of the core ( @xmath41 ergs ) should be transferred to the envelope in a few hundred years .",
    "the linear momentum of the swept up shell will be @xmath42 g cm s@xmath43 , which is consistent with the observations of proto - pns by @xcite .    finally , we note that the large - scale field in our simulations is strong enough to suppress turbulence due to shear instabilities near the core , and the field therefore is neither subject to decay nor the exponential growth that is important in some other models .",
    "we have instead focused on the physics of how the field actually drives the outflow ."
