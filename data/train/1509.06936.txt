    "coherent states in their multiple variants and generalizations have become an indispensable tool in various branches of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory .",
    "the standard coherent states are strongly connected to the quantum description of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "they were first mentioned by schrdinger @xcite , who realised that they describe wave packets with minimal uncertainty that follow the classical dynamics without changing their shape .",
    "glauber @xcite and sudarshan @xcite later rediscovered these states , gave a very detailed description of their properties and showed their relevance in quantum optics . since then they have also become an important tool in quantum field theory and a central ingredient of phase space formulations of quantum mechanics and semiclassical approximations .",
    "+ the standard coherent states have been generalised along various lines .",
    "e.g. , the group - theoretic approach generalizes the fact that standard coherent states can be obtained by a group action of the heisenberg - weyl group on the harmonic oscillator ground state .",
    "generalized coherent states can then be obtained by taking a different initial state or a different group ( and a hilbert space which carries a representation of that group ) @xcite .",
    "there are various other approaches to generalize coherent states that are discussed in the literature with many interesting applications @xcite .",
    "a property shared by most generalized coherent states is that they are labeled by continuous parameters and allow obtaining a formal resolution of unity ( _ via _ a projector valued measure on the set of continuous parameters ) .",
    "+ in this contribution we will consider a special case of a construction of coherent states on a hilbert space which is a tensor product @xmath0 . there is an obvious canonical construction if each of the factor spaces already comes with a set of coherent states , say @xmath1 and @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 stands for the set of continuous parameters on that space .",
    "one may then define the coherent states on the tensor product @xmath5 as the tensor product of coherent states in each factor @xmath6 . in the following",
    "we will show that the special case where @xmath7 and @xmath8 one may define generalized coherent states that are ( for almost all values of the continuous parameters ) entangled , i.e. not product states . physically , the tensor coherent states are quite natural for describing a quantum point - particle on the line with spin @xmath9 ( a point particle in @xmath10 is described analogously by appropriate tensor - product coherent states ) .",
    "+ it is however interesting to see that entangled coherent states , sharing many properties of the standard coherent states can be defined .",
    "we adopt the name _ electron - hole coherent states _ for our construction as they may be used in a natural way for electronic excitations in a superconductor or a hybrid superconducting - normalconducting device .",
    "these are described by the bogoliubov - de gennes equation and the factor @xmath11 of the hilbert space refers to electron - like and hole - like components of the wave function .    in section",
    "[ can - cs ] we review the main properties of standard coherent states , @xmath12 coherent states for arbitrary spin , and tensor product states of standard coherent states with the spin coherent states .",
    "+ in section [ eh - cs ] we construct electron - hole coherent states , derive their main properties , and show that they fit into the group theoretic approach to generalized coherent states if one drops the assumption that the group has to act linearly on the hilbert space .",
    "we also give a brief account of the relation of electron - hole coherent states to the bogoliubov - de gennes equation + in section [ eh - cs - app ] we look at generalisations of various coherent state representations of operators and states . we also discuss some limitations of electron - hole coherent states when trying to generalize the phase space formulations of quantum mechanics that is based on husimi functions .",
    "these limitations may be less severe in a semiclassical regime of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation .",
    "the construction of standard coherent states can be found in various textbooks . as they are one ingredient of the definition of electron - hole coherent states in section [ eh - cs ] we will give a short summary of their construction and their basic properties .",
    "we will focus mainly on properties that may be used as alternative definitions  each of",
    "these has been used as a starting point for generalising the concept of coherent states .",
    "usually focussing on one property of coherent states will imply that not all properties of standard coherent states will hold in the generalisation . in section [ eh - cs ]",
    "we will analyse how these properties generalise to the electron - hole coherent states defined there ( and what limitations arise ) .",
    "one may start from the ( unique up to isomorphisms ) irreducible unitary representation of the heisenberg - weyl group @xmath13 . in this representation",
    "the group is generated by the annihilation operator @xmath14 , the creation operator @xmath15 and the identity operator @xmath16 ( if @xmath17 is a scalar we will usually write @xmath18 ) with commutation relations @xmath19",
    "= \\hat{1 } \\quad\\text{and } \\quad    \\left[\\hat{1},a\\right]=\\left[\\hat{1},a^\\dagger\\right]=0 .\\ ] ] in the unitary representation the creation and annihilation operators are hermitian conjugates of each other ( in general we will denote the hermitian conjugate of an operator @xmath20 as @xmath21 ) .",
    "+ the unitary representation of the heisenberg - weyl group is obtained by taking the exponential of anti - hermitian linear combinations of the generators , i.e. a ( representation of a ) group element is of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the second equality can be established using the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula which also allows one to find the multiplication law @xmath25 which is indeed the multiplication law of the heisenberg - weyl group @xmath13 .",
    "one also finds @xmath26 which shows that the representation is indeed unitary .",
    "+ the infinite dimensional hilbert space @xmath27 of this irreducible representation is spanned by the orthogonal ( and normalised ) number state basis ( aka fock basis ) @xmath28 ( where orthonormality implies @xmath29 ) in which the generators act as    @xmath30    the last equation shows that @xmath31 is an eigenstate of the number operator @xmath32 .",
    "these states are thus the energy eigenstates the harmonic oscillator which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath33 . for @xmath34 the number state @xmath35 will be called the vacuum .",
    "+ it is well known that the abstract hilbert space @xmath36 together with the representation of the heisenberg - weyl generators are isomorphic to the hilbert space of square - integrable functions on the line @xmath37 which is used to describe quantum point particle in one dimension .",
    "the solution of the harmonic oscillator provides a standard way to identify the two hilbert spaces and representations ",
    "the isomorphism is however not unique and we will come back to this point .      the standard coherent states on @xmath36 can now be defined by acting with elements of the heisenberg - weyl group on the vacuum @xmath38 note that @xmath39 , so by setting @xmath40 in our definition we fixed a phase convention .",
    "it is sometimes convenient to define coherent states that omit the normalization factor @xmath41 , that is @xmath42 while @xmath43 is not normalised , it is analytic as a function of @xmath3 . as a manifold the coherent states are equivalent to the complex plane @xmath44 which is equivalent to the coset space @xmath45 ( _ via _ the map @xmath46 ) .",
    "one may identify this plane with the classical phase space and the heisenberg - weyl group translates points in phase space , i.e. @xmath47 in the rest of the paper standard coherent states in the hilbert space @xmath36 will always be denoted with the letter @xmath3 ( sometimes with an additional index ) .",
    "note that the vacuum is the coherent state with @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49 ( writing just @xmath35 does thus not lead to ambiguities ) .",
    "a general coherent state is a superposition of number states @xmath50 this implies that the probability @xmath51 to find the @xmath52-th number state in a given coherent state is poisson distributed @xmath53 .",
    "the probabilities take dominant values when @xmath52 is comparable to @xmath54 .",
    "indeed the maximal probability arises when @xmath52 is the largest integer smaller than @xmath54 .",
    "it is also straightforward to find the expectation value of the number operator @xmath55 this calculation becomes even simpler if one establishes that standard coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator , @xmath56 this property can be used also as an alternative definition for standard coherent states . using the identities",
    "@xmath57    one can derive and show that a definition based on is equivalent to our definition ( up to choice of phase conventions ) .",
    "apart from the algebraic structure given so far the probably most important property of coherent states is that they form a complete set in @xmath36 that can be used in a similar way as a basis . using either the expansion in number states or the group multiplication one can establish that coherent states have a non - vanishing overlap , @xmath58 which implies that one can not build an orthonormal basis from coherent states",
    "nevertheless , the coherent states are complete ( indeed overcomplete ) as they allow obtaining the resolution of unity in terms of projectors onto coherent states @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "this resolution can be derived either by formally reducing it to the resolution @xmath61 in terms of the orthonormal basis of number states or ( more elegantly but also by means of more advanced tools ) using schur s lemma from representation theory . from this identity",
    "it follows that we can calculate the trace of an operator @xmath20 as @xmath62 and that we may represent any abstract state @xmath63 in terms of an explicit function @xmath64 on the plane .",
    "the scalar product of two states is then given by @xmath65 note that @xmath66 is not an analytic function of @xmath3 .",
    "however @xmath67 turns out to be analytic in @xmath3 and this gives rise to the so - called bargmann representation ( see @xcite ) .      as @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "are not hermitian operators they do not qualify as quantum observables .",

    "it leads to an alternative definition of standard coherent states as the set of minimal uncertainty states with equal variances of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the minimal uncertainty of coherent states is one of the main reasons why coherent states have become such an important tool for investigating quantum - classical correspondence in the semiclassical regime , when a coherent state deforms mildly during the dynamics for sufficiently small times .",
    "if one starts the dynamics in the coherent state @xmath76 then for sufficiently short times the state is well approximated by a trajectory @xmath77 of coherent states , where @xmath78 is a classical trajectory in phase space ( obtained from corresponding classical hamiltonian dynamics ) .",
    "if the classical dynamics is not chaotic this approximation may work for quite long times .",
    "a special case is the harmonic oscillator @xmath79 , where @xmath80 . in the position representation",
    "this leads to a gaussian function whose centre follows the classical oscillations in space without changing its shape otherwise .",
    "this is the form in which coherent states were used by schrdinger to investigate quantum - classical correspondence for the harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "one well - known generalisation of the standard coherent states replaces the heisenberg - weyl group by some other ( physically relevant ) group @xmath81 whose generators are observables of a quantum system .",
    "this has been developed mainly by gilmore @xcite and perelomov @xcite . in this case",
    "one takes an irreducible representation of @xmath81 on an appropriate hilbert space , chooses an appropriate reference state @xmath82 and then defines the coherent states by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is an element of the group .",
    "if the reference state is chosen appropriately one may find coherent states which have analogues of almost all main properties of the standard coherent states ( overcompleteness with an explicit resolution of unity , appropriately defined minimal uncertainties , relation to classical phase - space , etc . ) .",
    "the most prominent example of this are the @xmath12 coherent states @xcite , which are also known as spin coherent states or angular momentum coherent states .",

    "only the simplest case @xmath92 is relevant , so we will focus our summary on these ( see @xcite for details ) . in that case",
    "the hilbert space @xmath93 is spanned by two orthogonal states , @xmath94 and the @xmath12 generators are represented by the ( hermitian ) pauli matrices , @xmath95 let us introduce the combinations @xmath96 note that contain a factor @xmath9 that is omitted in ( for convenience ) .",
    "almost all elements of @xmath12 are covered by the parameterisation @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",

    "for @xmath92 it is straightforward to evaluate the overlap @xmath105 of two coherent states and find an explicit resolution of unity as @xmath106 where the integration over @xmath44 may be considered as an intregral over the classical phase space which is a sphere .",

    "this means that acting with any element of @xmath120 on a product coherent state gives a product coherent state up to an additional scalar phase factor .",
    "product coherent states of this or analogous forms are often very useful in the analysis of quantum systems that involve tensor product spaces .",
    "for instance , the states @xmath122 are often a natural choice to analyse equations of the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are hermitian operators on @xmath36 lifted naturally to @xmath126 ( such standard abuse of notation will be used frequently ) .",

    "+ analogously the ` husimi function ' @xmath326 does not give a complete description of the state .",
    "it can still be useful in order to analyse visually how a given state is distributed in the position - velocity phase space .",
    "one may compare this to the distribution in the position - momentum phase space _ via _ the corresponding husimi function @xmath327 in product coherent states ( giving a complete description ) . for this one may use the reduced phase space functions @xmath328 where the quasi - spin variable is integrated out .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows such reduced phase space distributions if the state is in a particular electron - hole coherent state @xmath329 .",
    "the quasi - spin position of the product state @xmath330 can not be seen in the reduced function @xmath296 in position - momentum phase space . comparing it to the reduced function @xmath289 in position - velocity phase space",
    "reveals that the original state has both an electron and a hole component . for an electron - hole coherent state @xmath331 the roles of the two reduced phase space functions",
    "is interchanged .",
    "an interesting physical phenomenon that may be analysed visually in the phase space is the andreev reflection at a boundary between a normal conducting region ( where the pair potential vanishes @xmath332 ) and a superconducting region ( @xmath333 ) .",
    "an incoming electron - like state with energy @xmath295 close to the fermi energy @xmath334 is then reflected as a hole - like state with ( almost ) opposite velocity while the momentum has hardly changed .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows reduced phase space functions for the stationary scattering states at energy @xmath295 from a staircase pair potential @xmath335 together with the corresponding spinor wave function .",
    "for @xmath336 the ( envelope of the ) intensity of the spinor wave function decays exponentially @xmath337 where @xmath338 for these states the reduced representation @xmath289 in the position - velocity phase space separates the incoming electron and the reflected hole amplitudes and gives a more detailed picture of the dynamics .",
    "however this does not necessarily imply that the electron - hole coherent state representation should always be used on its own .",
    "for instance in the middle row of figure [ fig2 ] parameters have been chosen such that the incoming electron has a velocity that is somewhat above the fermi velocity and the velocity of the reflected hole is ( in absolute value ) somewhat below the fermi velocity .",
    "this is well resolved in the position - velocity phase space function @xmath289 built from electron - hole coherent states but not in the position - momentum phase space function @xmath296 built on product coherent states , where the incoming and outgoing contributions overlap strongly . on the other side the same parameters also imply an apreciable electron - electron reflection where the reflected electron has opposite momentum to the incoming .",
    "this weak effect can only be seen in the position - momentum representation ( the weak stripe near @xmath339 ) .",
    "the andreev reflection from an inhomogeneous superconductor may be modelled by a pair potential of the form @xmath340 .",
    "the stationary solutions at energy @xmath295 are oscillatory for @xmath341 and decay for @xmath342",
    ". we will choose @xmath343 and @xmath344 .",
    "then the corresponding turning point is at @xmath306 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows reduced phase space distributions for stationary scattering states for an incoming electronic wave .",
    "while generally the phase space function @xmath289 in position - velocity space gives more details than the position - momentum function @xmath296 .",
    "however , the position - velocity representation does not offer nice semiclassical descriptions in terms of trajectories . as can be seen in the second row of figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "these only come about in the position - momentum representation .",
    "we have constructed electron - hole coherent states as minimum uncertainty states for position and velocity for the bogoliubov - de gennes equation .",
    "we derived and analysed their main properties : they entangle space and quasi - spin degrees of freedom and they form an overcomplete set with an explicit resolution of unity .",
    "basic applications to stationary scattering in superconductors revealed both their usefulness and some limitations . in spite of these limitations",
    "we have shown that electron - hole coherent states have a potential of describing the dynamics of electron - hole excitations in a superconductor as remain localized in position - velocity phase space for a certain time .",
    "a more detailed description of the dynamics of these states may lead to new insights on well - known effects in superconductors and at normalconducting - superconducting interfaces ."
