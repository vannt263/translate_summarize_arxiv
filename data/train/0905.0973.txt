    "the use of chiral lagrangians in combination with unitary techniques in coupled channels of mesons and baryons has been a very fruitful scheme to study the nature of many hadron resonances .",
    "the analysis of meson baryon scattering amplitudes shows poles in the second riemann sheet which are identified with existing baryon resonances . in this way",
    "the interaction of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons with the octet of stable baryons has lead to @xmath3 resonances which fit quite well the spectrum of the known low lying resonances with these quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "similarly , the interaction of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons with the decuplet of baryons also leads to many resonances that can be identified with existing ones of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "sometimes a new resonance is predicted , as in the case of the @xmath5 , where all the chiral approaches find two poles close by , rather than one , a fact that finds experimental support in the analyses of refs .",
    "the nature of the resonances is admittedly more complex than just a molecule of pseudoscalar and baryon , but the success of this picture in reproducing many experimental data on decay and production of the resonances provides support to claim very large components of this character for the resonance wave function . in some cases",
    "one can even reach the limits of the model and find observables that call for extra components , even if small , but essential to explain some data .",
    "this can be seen for instance in the radiative decay of the @xmath6 @xcite , or in the helicity form factors of the @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "another promising approach is the one followed in @xcite , based on the naturalness of the subtraction constants in the dispersion relations that hint in some cases at the existence of non meson baryon components , particularly in the case of the @xmath7 .",
    "another step forward in this direction has been the interpretation of low lying @xmath8 as molecular states of two pseudoscalar mesons and one baryon @xcite .",
    "much work has been done using pseudoscalar mesons as building blocks , but the consideration of vectors instead of pseudoscalars is only beginning to be exploited . in the baryon sector",
    "the interaction of the @xmath9 @xmath10 has been recently addressed in @xcite , where three degenerate @xmath11 states around 1800 mev and three degenerate @xmath10 states around @xmath12 mev , with @xmath13 , are found .",
    "this work has been recently extended to the su(3 ) space of vectors and baryons of the decuplet in @xcite .",
    "the underlying theory for this study is the hidden gauge formalism @xcite , which deals with the interaction of vector mesons and pseudoscalars in a way respecting chiral dynamics , providing the interaction of pseudoscalars among themselves , with vector mesons , and vector mesons among themselves .",
    "it also offers a perspective on the chiral lagrangians as limiting cases at low energies of vector exchange diagrams occurring in the theory . in a more recent work , looking for poles in the @xmath14 scattering amplitudes , the @xmath15 channel is also included @xcite and a resonance around 1700 mev is dynamically generated , having the strongest coupling to this later channel .    in the meson sector , the interaction of @xmath16 within this formalism has been addressed in @xcite , where it has been shown to lead to the dynamical generation of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 meson resonances , with a branching ratio for the sensitive @xmath19 decay channel in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "this work has been extended to the interaction of the su(3 ) vector mesons in @xcite , where several known resonances are also dynamically generated .    in the present work we study the interaction of the octet of vector mesons with the octet of stable baryons , using the unitary approach in coupled channels .",
    "we shall see that the scattering amplitudes lead to poles in the complex plane which can be associated to some well known resonances . under the approximation of neglecting the three momentum of the particles versus their mass",
    ", we obtain degenerate states of @xmath0 , a pattern which seems to be followed qualitatively by the experimental spectrum , although in some cases the spin partners have not been identified . a different approach to account for the vector - baryon interaction",
    "is the one followed in @xcite where pseudoscalar mesons , vector mesons and baryons mix , advocating su(6 ) symmetry for the interaction .",
    "the approach leads to the same pseudoscalar - baryon interaction than the hidden gauge approach , but to different results when it comes to the interaction of the vector mesons with baryons .",
    "in particular , the spin degeneracy predicted by the hidden gauge approach does not show up in the matrix elements of the potential in the su(6 ) scheme .",
    "we follow the formalism of the hidden gauge interaction for vector mesons of @xcite ( see also @xcite for a practical set of feynman rules ) . the lagrangian involving the interaction of vector mesons amongst themselves is given by @xmath21 where the symbol @xmath22 stands for the trace in the @xmath23 space and @xmath24 is given by @xmath25\\ , \\label{vmunu}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is @xmath27 with @xmath28 mev the pion decay constant .",

    "[ fig : feyn](a ) , and under the low energy approximation of neglecting @xmath43 in the propagator of the exchanged vector , where @xmath44 is the momentum transfer , one obtains the same amplitudes as obtained from the ordinary chiral lagrangian for pseudoscalar - baryon octet interaction @xcite , namely the weinberg - tomozawa terms .",
    "one could anticipate some analogy between the vector - baryon amplitudes with the pseudoscalar - baryon ones , given the similarity of the lagrangians in the way we have written them in eqs .",
    "( [ l3vsimp ] ) and ( [ lagrvpp ] ) . however , one also anticipates differences . indeed , in the case of the pseudoscalar , fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn](a ) , there is only one vector meson in the @xmath45 coupling and this must necessarily be the one that is exchanged in the diagram . however , in the vector case , fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn](b ) , the @xmath46 vertex involves three vector mesons and any of them can correspond in principle to the exchanged vector in the diagram .",
    "nevertheless , one can proceed consequently with neglecting @xmath43 as implicit in the chiral lagrangians @xcite , by also neglecting the three momentum of the external vectors versus the vector mass . in this case",
    ", the polarization vectors of the external vector mesons have only spatial components , since the zeroth component is either zero for the transverse polarizations , or negligible for the longitudinal one , ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "then , by examining the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ l3vsimp ] ) one realizes that the field @xmath48 can not correspond to an external vector meson .",
    "indeed , if this were the case , the @xmath49 index would be spatial and then the partial derivative @xmath50 would lead to a three momentum of the vector mesons which are neglected in the approach .",
    "we can then conclude that the field @xmath48 corresponds to the exchanged vector and the analogy with the pseudoscalar and vector interaction is then evident .",
    "indeed , they are formally identical , by substituting the octet of pseudoscalar fields by the octet of the vector fields , with the additional factor @xmath51 in the case of the interaction of the vector mesons .",
    "note that @xmath52 becomes @xmath53 and the signs of the lagrangians also agree .",
    "a small amendment is in order in the case of vector mesons , which is due to the mixing of @xmath54 and the singlet of su(3 ) , @xmath55 , to give the physical states of the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 mesons : @xmath58 given the structure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : omephi ] ) , the singlet state which is accounted for by the v matrix , @xmath59 , does not provide any contribution to eq .",
    "( [ l3vsimp ] ) , in which case all one must do is to take the matrix elements known for the @xmath60 interaction and , wherever @xmath37 corresponds to the @xmath61 , the amplitude should be multiplied by the factor @xmath62 to get the corresponding @xmath63 contribution , and by @xmath64 to get the corresponding @xmath57 contribution . upon the approximation consistent with neglecting the three momentum versus the mass of the particles ( in this case the baryon ) , we can just take the @xmath65 component of eq .",
    "( [ lagr82 ] ) and then the transition potential corresponding to the diagram of [ fig : feyn](b ) is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the energies of the incoming and outgoing vector meson .",
    "the @xmath68 coefficients of eq .",
    "( [ kernel ] ) can be obtained directly from @xcite with the simple rules given above for the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 mesons , and substituting @xmath69 by @xmath9 and @xmath70 by @xmath71 in the matrix elements .",
    "the coefficients are obtained both in the physical basis of states or in the isospin basis . here",
    "we will directly study the interaction in isospin basis and in the appendix we collect the tables of the @xmath68 coefficients for different states of isospin , @xmath72 , and strangeness , @xmath73",
    ". the tables immediately show the sectors where there is attraction and therefore give chances to find bound states or resonances .",
    "we can see that the cases with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the last two corresponding to exotic channels , are repulsive and do not produce poles in the scattering matrices .",
    "however , the sectors @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are attractive and we expect to find bound states and resonances in these cases .",
    "the next step to construct the scattering matrix implies solving the coupled channels bethe salpeter equation in the on shell factorization approach of @xcite @xmath81^{-1}\\ , v \\label{eq : bethe}\\ ] ] with @xmath82 being the loop function of a vector meson and a baryon which we calculate in dimensional regularization using the formula of @xcite @xmath83 \\right\\ } \\ , \\label{eq : gpropdr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath84 a regularization scale , which we take to be 630 mev , and with a natural value of the subtraction constant @xmath85 of @xmath86 , as determined in @xcite .",
    "the iteration of diagrams implicit in the bethe salpeter equation in the case of the vector mesons has a subtlety with respect to the case of the pseudoscalars .",
    "the @xmath51 term of the interaction forces the intermediate vector mesons in the loops to propagate with the spatial components in the loops . we need to sum over the polarizations of the internal vector mesons which , because they are tied to the external ones through the @xmath51 factor , provides @xmath87",
    "as shown in @xcite , the on shell factorization leads to a correction coefficient in the @xmath82 function of @xmath88 versus unity , which is negligibly small , and which we also neglect here in consonance with the approximations done .",
    "in this case the factor @xmath51 , appearing in the potential @xmath89 , factorizes also in the @xmath90 matrix for the external vector mesons .",
    "the formalism described above would provide results obtained using fixed masses for the vector mesons and no width .",
    "the mass distributions of the @xmath9 and @xmath71 mesons are sufficiently extended to advise a more accurate calculation that takes this large width into account .",
    "we follow the traditional method of convoluting the @xmath82 function with the mass distributions of the @xmath9 or @xmath71 mesons , as is customarily made @xcite .",
    "one can prove that this convolution is equivalent to calculating the loop function with the dressed vector meson propagator written in terms of its lehmann representation , as is done in calculations of medium effects in the scattering matrices @xcite .",
    "the method amounts to replacing the @xmath82 function by @xmath91 obtained as @xmath92 with @xmath93 being the normalization factor , and @xmath94 the decay width of the meson ( @xmath95 ) , which we take to be 149.4 mev and 50.5 mev for the @xmath9 and @xmath71 meson , respectively .",
    "the energy dependent width @xmath96 for the @xmath9 meson , obtained from its decay into two pions in @xmath97-wave , is given by @xmath98 a similar expression gives the energy dependent width of the @xmath71 meson from its decay into a @xmath70 meson and a pion .",
    "we will see that , using fixed masses for the vector mesons , one finds bound states in the @xmath15 and @xmath99 amplitudes , i.e. states having zero width . however , when @xmath91 is used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bethe ] ) and , therefore , both the @xmath9 and @xmath71 vector mesons are taken with their corresponding mass distribution , there is phase space for the decay of each of these bound states into some of the mass components of the vector meson and the nucleon , thereby acquiring an appreciable width .",
    "we search for poles in the scattering matrices in the second riemann sheet , as defined in previous works @xcite , basically changing @xmath100 by to @xmath101 in the analytical formula of the @xmath82 function , eq . ( [ eq : gpropdr ] ) , for channels where re@xmath102 is above the threshold of the corresponding channel .",
    "when one has a mass distribution of the @xmath9 and @xmath71 mesons , and hence a fuzzy description of the threshold for some channels , one could take different prescriptions for going to the optimal riemann sheet that better reflects the behavior of the amplitude in the real axis , which is where the physical information is contained .",
    "the results are very similar in all cases , expect when one has a resonance very close to threshold , where the convolution can distort the shape of the amplitude and make even the pole disappear . in view of that , for these cases the couplings are obtained from the amplitudes in the real axis as follows . assuming these amplitudes to behave as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the position of the maximum of @xmath105 , with @xmath106 being the channel to which the resonance couples more strongly , and @xmath107 its width at half - maximum , one then finds @xmath108 up to a global phase , this expression allows one to determine the value of @xmath109 , which we take to be real .",
    "the other couplings are then derived from @xmath110    this procedure to obtain the couplings from @xmath111 in the real axis was used in @xcite where it was found that changes in the input parameters that lead to moderate changes in the position and the width of the states affected the couplings more smoothly . having this in mind",
    ", we also calculate , as a check , the couplings in the case of the particles without width from the residues of the amplitudes in the first riemann sheet of the complex plane .",
    "the couplings obtained in this way are very similar to those obtained by means of eqs .",
    "( [ couprealaxis ] ) and ( [ couprealaxis2 ] ) employing amplitudes in the real axis obtained with the convolution method .",
    "the differences between the couplings obtained with the two methods are of the order of 10 - 20  % .",
    "in this section we show our results obtained in the attractive sectors mentioned above .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : s0 ] we show the results of @xmath112 as a function of @xmath113 for the different channels in the @xmath77 sector .",
    "we can see a neat bump for @xmath114 around 1700 mev , a few mev below the @xmath15 threshold .",
    "the width of the peak is due to the convolution of the @xmath9 mass . for a @xmath9 of fixed mass and no width",
    "one obtains a bound state with a small binding .",
    "the bump around 1700 mev is also seen in the @xmath115 channel but is absent or barely visible in the @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 channels . on the other hand , with the same strangeness and isospin ,",
    "one finds a second peak around 1970 mev , which is clearly visible in the @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 channels but not visible in the @xmath15 one . this special behavior has to do with the coupling of the resonances to the different channels which will be studied below .          in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm1 ] we show @xmath112 for two cases , @xmath124 and @xmath79 .",
    "for @xmath125 we see again a clear peak behavior of @xmath112 around 1800 mev in the @xmath126 channel .",
    "the structure is also seen in all the other channels , except in the @xmath127 one . in the @xmath128 channel",
    "one can see another structure around 1920 mev , below the @xmath128 threshold , which could be associated to a bound state of this system .",
    "finally in the @xmath127 channel one finds another clear structure corresponding to a resonance around 2140 mev , practically invisible in the other channels , which could qualify as a @xmath127 bound state .",
    "the @xmath129 case shows a clear peak around 1830 mev in the @xmath130 channel .",
    "this structure is also seen in other channels , but it could be the cusp due to the opening of the @xmath126 channel .",
    "we will come back to this when we make a search for the poles of the @xmath90 matrix . in the @xmath131 channel , and",
    "also visible in the @xmath127 channel , we see another less pronounced structure around 1990 mev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm2 ] we display the sector @xmath132 . in this case",

    "another clear peak appears around 2080 mev , shortly below the @xmath118 threshold , which is more pronounced in the @xmath135 channel and appears as an interference minimum in the @xmath134 channel .",
    "since the spin dependence only comes from the @xmath51 factor and there is no dependence on the spin of the baryons , the interaction for vector - baryon states with @xmath136 and @xmath137 is the same and then one should associate each peak with the existence of two degenerate states .",

    "<S> we examine the scattering amplitudes and their poles , which can be associated to known @xmath0 baryon resonances , in some cases , or give predictions in other ones . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism employed produces doublets of degenerate @xmath0 states , a pattern which is observed experimentally in several cases . </S>",
    "<S> the findings of this work should also be useful to guide present experimental programs searching for new resonances , in particular in the strange sector where the current information is very poor .    </S>",
