    "a mott transition is expected to occur when the overlap between atomic orbitals in an insulator becomes large enough for the hopping energy to overcome the energy associated with charge fluctuations . to understand",
    "this transition has turned out to be a very difficult problem that has been attacked by a variety of means , with dynamic mean field theory being an important recent contribution @xcite . in the present work we will develop an alternative approach , more in the spirit of bcs theory , which is appropriate for understanding doped mott insulators where the parent state has an even number of electrons , and thus integer spin , at each state .",
    "such models have been considered for instance in two - band hubbard models in the context of ruthenate alloys @xcite , and multi - band hubbard models in the theory of doped @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we will present evidence for non - fermi liquid behavior in these systems even for weak doping .",
    "we shall focus on the simplest system to which our conclusions apply , namely the spin @xmath5 hubbard model on a square lattice with anti - hunds rule couplings @xcite .",
    "we define the local particle number by @xmath6 and the spin by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the generators of spin @xmath5 rotations .",
    "furthermore , we define the operator @xmath10 which creates an @xmath11 state with two fermions @xcite , @xmath12 .",
    "we also define the @xmath13 invariant @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian containing the maximal number of onsite terms permitted by symmetry is @xmath15 where an arbitrary chemical potential is absorbed in @xmath16 .",
    "another term which can be considered is of course @xmath17 , but for spin @xmath5 this obeys @xmath18 , so there is no loss of generality in the onsite term of our hamiltonian aside from ignoring the possibility of an arbitrary term proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "we will consider the case @xmath20 , thus the singlet state is heavily favored near @xmath21 .",
    "the single site spectrum consists of sixteen states : an empty site , four equivalent spin @xmath5 singly charged states , a singlet and five spin @xmath22 doubly charged sites , four spin @xmath5 charge three states and a charge four singlet .",
    "if @xmath23 is the atomic ground state for @xmath24 particles we find @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the quintet state has energy @xmath28 .",
    "the lowest energy states obey @xmath29 so there is no tendency for superconducting pair formation from any of the local interactions .    with our choice of parameters ,",
    "standard arguments imply that the ground state for @xmath21 and small @xmath30 should be a spin singlet . for small doping near zero filling",
    ", the ground state will most likely be a normal fermi liquid .",
    "this statement may be violated if @xmath16 and @xmath31 are sufficiently large , and a spin - symmetry breaking state may appear according to the stoner criterion . whether or not this happens depends on the density of states , which at least in the case of two dimensions remains finite even down to @xmath32 .",
    "numerical simulations indicate the tendency toward spin ordering is grossly exaggerated in mean field theory @xcite . in any case",
    "a deeper discussion of this point is not within the scope of the present article , which is to investigate the analog of a fermi liquid near half filling .",
    "the mott singlet @xmath33 at site @xmath34 is created from the vacuum by the operator @xmath35 given by @xmath36 a natural first attempt to understand the system for small hole doping is to try the same method as for the nearly half filled spin @xmath37 hubbard model , _",
    "i.e. _ , to make a particle - hole transformation @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are new local fermionic creation and destruction operators .",
    "in contrast to the case of the filled spin 1/2 hubbard model however , this canonical transformation fails a number of criteria if the mott singlet is to act as a vacuum for the new operators . in particular",
    ", we see that @xmath41    the first inequality is perhaps not so severe ; after all the operator @xmath42 , being fundamentally a fermion creation operator creates a state with three fermions on site @xmath34 , and we could argue that we could ignore this problem by suitably projecting the states on those with two or less particles .",
    "this is in fact the approach usually taken in attempts to perturbatively construct a new vacuum at @xmath21 .",
    "the second inequality is much worse ; it is a consequence of the singlet being entangled , _",
    "i.e. _ it can not be written as a product state in any one - particle basis . as a result",
    ", the putative creation operator does not generate a normalized state from the vacuum .",
    "the entanglement property implies that the destruction operator on the created state does not recreate the ground state  not even in the two particle space since it projects into the @xmath43 two - particle states .",
    "we now show how to systematically construct creation and annihilation operators that have the correct local properties . we seek a canonical transformation that fulfills the following criteria : ( a ) it maps @xmath44 to @xmath45 , and ( b ) it maps the singly charged states to themselves . due to our choice of interaction parameters , where @xmath46 , we also expect that the state composed of two holes will play the same role in the hole doped mott insulator near @xmath21 , as the doubly charged singlet does for small filling .",
    "the canonical transformation that we desire therefore has the property that it interchanges the mott singlet and the vacuum , leaving all other states invariant .",
    "the @xmath47 doubly charged states will have the same charge as the mott singlet .",
    "however , due to the constraints imposed by a canonical transformation utilizing only the spin @xmath5 fermion operators , these doubly charged states must be obtained by two applications of the new creation operator , while the singlet created by another double combination of these creation operators forms a state with relative charge minus two .",
    "these considerations force the canonical transformation to be charge non - conserving .",
    "the canonical transformation that accomplishes this and similar mappings can be systematically obtained through the method in ref . @xcite",
    ". however , we can obtain it without much formalism through the following argument .",
    "our desired operator is `` almost '' @xmath48 .",
    "the problem is that this operator generates unwanted side effects in the @xmath49 and @xmath21 particle subspaces by mapping these to new states with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we can get rid of these unwanted overlaps by using a projection operator , and therefore define @xmath52 by @xmath53 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath54 , that @xmath55 , and that @xmath56 and @xmath52 annihilate all other states .",
    "a canonical transformation that rotates the states @xmath57 and @xmath58 at each site @xmath59 into each other without affecting the other states is provided by the unitary operator @xmath60 where @xmath61 ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 are real ) . on @xmath57 and @xmath58 the transformation becomes @xmath64 whereas it is unity on all other states .",
    "choosing @xmath65 , for all @xmath59 , we obtain the canonical transformation that fulfills our criteria , _",
    "i.e. _ it interchanges the empty state and the mott state at each site without affecting the other states .    applying the unitary transformation eq .",

    "[ eq : unitary ] that the unitary transformation gives a state where the phase factors enter in a non - trivial way .",
    "in particular , this is the case for the slightly doped mott insulator , which we will be interested in below .",
    "this will be mapped onto a state near the true vacuum state , which can then be analyzed with standard methods .",
    "note that the phase factors , @xmath67 , are crucial to retain local gauge symmetry in the same way as the complex phases introduced into the bogoliubov transformations are necessary to restore gauge invariance in bcs theory .",
    "we now turn to a systematic variational analysis of the slightly doped mott insulator using the canonical transformation in eq .",
    "[ eq : unitary ] , and use computer algebra to handle the complicated fermion polynomials that occur . in analogy with ordinary fermi liquid theory , as well as the bcs theory of superconductivity , we will then search for a variational state with particle number given by @xmath69 that is obtained from the vacuum by a canonical transformation @xmath70 depending on a set of parameters @xmath71 .",

    "this operator is obtained by replacing each occurence of the fermion operator @xmath90 by @xmath91 and similarly for @xmath92 .",
    "this expression is complicated , but it can nonetheless be worked out exactly in terms of polynomials of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , since the fermion algebra at a site is closed . the exact expression , written here for reference only , is given by @xmath94 where the subscripts are dropped on the right hand side .",
    "the notation @xmath95 is used to indicate a normal ordered operator , _",

    "@xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the onsite interaction is zero in the vacuum and two particle singlet subspace . since these are the only two states affected by the canonical transformation , this interaction remains invariant , while the chemical potential transforms according to @xmath98    anticipating a mean field calculation under the assumption of no spontaneously broken global symmetries , we do a wick decomposition of the onsite term , and calculate the expectation value according to @xmath99 where a hat indicates the expectation value of an operator composed of ordinary fermion operators evaluated in the state @xmath100 near the physical vacuum .",
    "similarly , the expectation values for the density and s - wave order parameter @xmath35 become exactly @xmath101 we now derive a similar expansion of the hopping operator . in this case",
    "the expressions become a terrible mess  far to complicated to write down in their entirety .",
    "it is however possible to construct a systematic expansion in the number of fermion operators , which is appropriate for small doping . to this respect , we take the entire expression , and rewrite it exactly as a sum of normal ordered terms .",
    "we then truncate this expression at fourth order in fermion operators and keep expectation values of on - site and nearest neighbor s - wave pairing amplitudes , ordinary hopping and density operators . defining @xmath102",
    "we find that the hopping operator , truncated to fourth order in fermion operators , becomes @xmath103 decomposing the s - wave order parameters as , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is real , we obtain , @xmath106 + ...   \\ , .",

    "note that the combinations @xmath108 and @xmath109 are gauge invariant , so it is physically meaningful to fix them to some value  this corresponds to locking the phase of the order parameter to those of the on - site s - wave density , _",

    "[ eq : hopmf ] would average to zero because of the phase factor @xmath119 . in the doped state",

    "<S> the ground state at exactly half filling is an insulating ( mott ) singlet , and according to our analysis a non - fermi liquid order parameter @xmath1 usually associated with extended s - wave superconductivity , will appear self - consistently as soon as a finite density @xmath2 holes are introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the non - fermi liquid behavior is a consequence of the nonlinear nature of the unitary transformation mapping the mott singlet state to a fock vacuum which introduces anomalous terms such as @xmath3 in the effective lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis uses an approach that generalizes readily to multi - band hubbard models and could provide a mechanism whereby a non - fermi liquid order parameter proportional to density is developed in mott insulators with locally entangled ground states . for more complicated systems , such an order parameter could coexist naturally with a variety of other order parameters . </S>"
