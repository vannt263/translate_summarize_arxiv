    "high continuous symmetry based on the su(@xmath0 ) unitary group with @xmath2 plays a fundamental role in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the description of hadrons stems from an approximate su(@xmath0 ) symmetry where @xmath0 is the number of species of quarks , or flavors .",
    "in contrast , the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry was originally introduced in condensed matter physics as a mathematical convenience to investigate the phases of strongly correlated systems .",
    "for instance , we enlarge the physically relevant spin - su(2 ) symmetry to su(@xmath0 ) and use the @xmath0 as a control parameter that makes various mean - field descriptions possible in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "we then carry out the systematic @xmath3-expansion to recover the original @xmath4 case.@xcite    extended continuous symmetries have been also used to unify several seemingly different competing orders in such a way that the corresponding order parameters can be transformed to each other under the symmetries .",
    "@xcite a paradigmatic example is the so(5 ) theory@xcite for the competition between @xmath5-wave superconductivity and antiferromagnetism , where the underlying order parameters are combined to form a unified order parameter quintet .",

    ", the consideration of su(4 ) symmetry might be a good starting point to study strongly correlated electrons with orbital degeneracy .",
    "@xcite    at the experimental level , realizations in condensed matter systems of enhanced continuous symmetry ( in stark contrast to the su(2 ) case ) are very rare since they usually require substantial fine - tuning of parameters .",
    "semiconductor quantum dots technology provides a notable exception as it enables the realization of an su(4 ) kondo effect resulting from the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite    due to their exceptional control over experimental parameters , ultracold fermions loaded into optical lattices might be ideal systems to investigate strongly correlated electrons with a high symmetry . while ultracold atomic gases with alkali atoms can , in principle , explore the physics with so(5 ) and su(3 ) symmetries , @xcite alkaline - earth atoms are likely to be the best candidates for experimental realizations of exotic su(@xmath0 ) many - body physics . @xcite these atoms and related ones , like ytterbium atoms , have a peculiar energy spectrum associated with the two - valence outer electrons . the ground state ( `` @xmath6 '' state ) is a long - lived singlet state @xmath7 and the spectrum exhibits a metastable triplet excited state ( `` @xmath8 '' state ) @xmath9 . due to the existence of an ultranarrow optical transition @xmath7-@xmath9 between these states , alkaline - earth - like atoms appear to be excellent candidates for atomic clocks and quantum simulation applications .",

    "@xcite very recent experiments on @xmath14sr ( respectively @xmath17yb ) atoms in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) ( respectively 3d ) optical lattice have directly observed the existence of the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry and determined the specific form of the interactions between the @xmath6 and @xmath8 states .",
    "@xcite all these results and future experiments might lead to the investigation of the rich exotic physics of su(@xmath0 ) fermions as for instance the realization of a chiral spin liquid phase with non - abelian statistics .",
    "@xcite    the simplest effective hamiltonian to describe an @xmath0-component fermi gas with an su(@xmath0 ) symmetry loaded into an 1d optical lattice is the su(@xmath0 ) generalization of the famous fermi - hubbard model : @xmath19 @xmath20 being the fermionic creation operator for site @xmath21 and nuclear spin states @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the density operator .",

    "the interacting coupling constant @xmath25 is directly related to the scattering length associated with the collision between two atoms in the @xmath6 state . in stark contrast to the @xmath4 case , the su(@xmath0 )",

    "one possible generalization is to exploit the existence of the @xmath8 state in the spectrum of alkaline - earth atoms and to consider a two - orbital extension of the su(@xmath0 ) fermi - hubbard model which is directly relevant to recent experiments .",
    "@xcite the interplay between orbital and su(@xmath0 ) nuclear spin degrees of freedom is then expected to give rise to several interesting phases , including symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) phases .",
    "@xcite the latter refer to non - degenerate fully gapped phases which do not break any symmetry and can not be characterized by local order parameters .",
    "since any gapful phases in one dimension have short - range entanglement , the presence of a symmetry is necessary to protect the properties of that 1d topological phase , in particular the existence of non - trivial edge states .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we will map out the zero - temperature phase diagrams of several two - orbital su(@xmath0 ) lattice models at half - filling by means of complementary use of analytical and numerical approaches .",
    "a special emphasis will be laid on the description of su(@xmath0 ) spt phases which can be stabilized in these systems . in this respect , as it will be shown here , several distinct spt phases will be found . in the particular @xmath4 case ,",
    "i.e. atoms with nuclear spin @xmath27 , the paradigmatic example of 1d spt phase , i.e. the spin-1 haldane phase @xcite , will be found for charge , orbital , and nuclear spin degrees of freedom . this phase is a non - degenerate gapful phase with spin-1/2 edges states which are protected by the presence of at least one of the three discrete symmetries : the dihedral group of @xmath28 rotations along the @xmath29 axes , time - reversal , and inversion symmetries.@xcite in the general @xmath0 case",
    ", we will show that the spin-@xmath1 haldane phase emerges only for the orbital degrees of freedom in the phase diagram of the two - orbital su(@xmath0 ) model",
    ". the resulting phase will be called orbital haldane ( oh ) phase and is an spt phase when @xmath1 is an odd integer . on top of these phases ,",
    "new 1d spt phases will be found which stem from the higher su(@xmath0 ) continuous symmetry of these alkaline - earth atoms .",
    "these phases are the generalization of the haldane phase for su(@xmath0 ) degrees of freedom with @xmath2 .",
    "as will be argued in the following , these topological phases for general @xmath0 are protected by the presence of psu(@xmath0 ) @xmath30 su(@xmath0)/@xmath31 symmetry . even in the absence of the latter symmetry , su(@xmath0 )",
    "topological phases may remain topological in the presence of other symmetries .",
    "for instance , with the ( link-)inversion symmetry present , our su(@xmath0 ) topological phase when @xmath1 is odd ( i.e. , @xmath32 which is directly relevant to ytterbium and strontium atoms ) crosses over to the topological haldane phase . a brief summary of these results has already been given in a recent paper @xcite where we have found these su(@xmath0 ) topological phases for a particular 1d two - orbital su(@xmath0 ) model .",

    "when @xmath276 , on the other hand , they attract each other and consequently stabilize usual cdw . ]",
    "the possibility to realize su(@xmath0)-symmetric models in alkaline - earth cold atoms experiments has revived the interest in determining what kind of electronic phases , possibly exotic , can be stabilized in these systems and more generally in establishing their phase diagrams . while this remains a challenging problem in general , we have presented a fairly complete study relevant for alkaline - earth fermionic atoms loaded into a 1d optical lattice at half - filling .",

    "moreover , this strategy has often been used in the past even to gain insight on possible phases in higher dimensions .",
    "last but not least , 1d optical lattices are easily created experimentally so that the exotic phases proposed could be investigated in future experiments .",
    "our choice of working at half - filling aims at investigating mott phases , which are presumably simpler in the sense that some ( charge ) degrees of freedom will be frozen , but may still exhibit a variety of properties as exemplified in our phase diagrams where several exotic spt phases have been found and characterized thanks to their nontrivial edge states , for instance .",
    "let us remind that precisely in an spt phase , edge states are protected ( and thus can not be removed without closing a gap ) as long as some particular ( protecting ) symmetry is present .",

    "we have obtained a large number of phase diagrams of the two models depending on the value of @xmath0 ( specifically , @xmath4 and @xmath33 ) and its parameters .",
    "our main conclusion is that the interplay between the orbital and the su(@xmath0 ) nuclear - spin degrees of freedom gives rise to several interesting phases : in particular , we presented microscopic models whose ground - states realize two different kinds of spt phases ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : strong - coupling - positive - j ] and [ sec : strong - coupling - negative - j ] ) .",
    "one of these spt phases concerns the orbital pseudo spins @xmath277 and can be described by an effective ( pseudo spin ) @xmath278 heisenberg chain , possibly with some single - ion anisotropy .",
    "if the original model we consider possesses the orbital su(2)@xmath66 symmetry ( which may require some fine - tuning ) , then there is no such anisotropy so that the physical properties are identical to those of the spin-@xmath1 heisenberg chain ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : phasediag_gorshkov_n4_su2 ] and [ fig : phasediag_alka_n4 ] ) .",
    "recent studies have shown@xcite that this gapped phase , when @xmath1 odd , is topologically protected by _ any _ one of the following symmetries : ( i ) @xmath28 rotations around two of the three spin axis ; ( ii ) time - reversal ; ( iii ) bond inversion . away from the su(@xmath279)@xmath66 regime ,",
    "the phase diagram is dominated by the trivial rung - singlet ( rs ) phase corresponding to the so - called large-@xmath184 phase in the spin - chain language , so that the observation of the spt phase remains challenging .",
    "quite interestingly too , in the case of intermediate values of @xmath184 , there is an extended critical phase for the integer @xmath1 strictly larger than 1 , that we have been able to characterise as the luttinger liquid of this orbital pseudo spin degree of freedom .",
    "our main observation is the appearance in a much wider region of parameter space of another su(@xmath0 ) topological phase , corresponding in the strong - coupling limit to an su(@xmath0 ) heisenberg chain with a self - conjugate representation ( young diagram with @xmath1 rows and 2 columns ) at each site .",
    "thanks to the vbs approach , we have been able to show : ( i ) this is a featureless gapped phase in the bulk , ( ii ) with open boundary conditions , there exist edge states ( corresponding to self - conjugate representation with @xmath1 rows and 1 column ) , ( iii ) this is an spt phase protected by @xmath280 ( this is the case in the su(@xmath0 ) phase of our systems ) or @xmath281 symmetry for any @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , this provides a microscopic realization of one ( among @xmath0 ) possible spt phases for su(@xmath0 ) models  @xcite , characterised by the number of boxes modulo @xmath0 in the young diagram describing the edge state ( here @xmath1 ) . note also that even if the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry is broken but there remains some bond inversion symmetry , then this topological phase remains protected iff @xmath1 is odd as the haldane one .    both our strong - coupling approach and",
    "our numerical simulations have confirmed the existence of this phase in a large regime of parameters , which make its potential observation more realistic .",
    "nevertheless , the detection of our topological phases is still a real challenge given that the edge states may be substantially suppressed or even absent if one takes into accout a harmonic trap  @xcite and it appears difficult , though not hopeless@xcite , at the moment to directly measure the rather involved non - local order parameters .",
    "an exciting possibility would be to use a box trapping scheme  @xcite where presumably edge states should be more visible .    quite remarkably , this topological su(@xmath0 ) phase is not found in the weak - coupling regime , both in the low - energy approach as well as in the numerical simulations , but instead is replaced by the spin - peierls - like ground state with bond - strength modulations . as discussed in ref .",
    ", we expect that the quantum phase transition between the topological su(@xmath0 ) phase and the dimerized one is described by a su(@xmath0)@xmath282 cft with central charge @xmath283 .",
    "since this prediction is independent on the microscopic model , we are looking forward to checking it using simpler hamiltonians with less degrees of freedom , which will be easier from the numerical point of view .    in this paper , we did not consider the case of odd @xmath0 , which can also be realized in the systems of alkaline - earth fermions by trapping only a subset of @xmath0(=even ) nuclear multiplet .",
    "in fact , already in the strong - coupling limit , one can see that the systems with even-@xmath0 considered here and those with odd-@xmath0 behave quite differently . for instance , as the orbital pseudo spin can never be quenched even in the mott region when @xmath0 odd , one obtains an su(@xmath0)-orbital - coupled effective hamiltonian for the region that was described by the su(@xmath0 ) heisenberg model or when @xmath0 even . mapping out the phases in the odd-@xmath0 system would be an interesting future problem .",
