    "the space - time structure as described by general relativity is a classic one in the sense that it is smooth even at very small distances and very large energies .",
    "however , there is an agreement that new phenomena caused by quantum gravity ( qg ) should affect this smoothness at a distance of the order of the planck length @xmath0 cm or equivalently the planck mass @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "despite the fact that we still lack a full quantum theory of gravity we can make some predictions derived from phenomenological quantum gravity .",
    "one of these predictions is a distortion of the photon dispersion relation @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the photon energy , @xmath5 its momentum , @xmath6 a model - dependent dimensionless parameter of order unity and @xmath7 the speed of light in vacuo .",
    "this distortion leads to an energy - dependent velocity of light given by @xmath8 a more general relation with an explicit lorentz symmetry breaking could be used @xcite , however there are stringent experimental limits on first order in @xmath9 modifications to dispersion relations in a lorentz breaking scenario , see e.g. @xcite or the constraint from the crab @xcite . on the other hand lorentz invariance could be seen as a consequence of the foamy structure of space - time caused by quantum fluctuations on short times and distance scales @xcite .",
    "another approach , called deformed ( or doubly ) special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite , introduces a second constant scale ( the planck length @xmath9 or equivalently the planck energy @xmath10 ) that is observer independent .",
    "this yields a non - linear casimir operator of dsr which may result in an energy - dependent speed of light , depending on the chosen model .",
    "however , a common feature of all dsr models is that the speed of light does not depend on the helicity .",
    "one reason why present experiments have not been able until now to either rule out or confirm a violation of the lorentz symmetry is the fact that the correction to the velocity of light in eq .",
    "is suppressed by the planck energy . however , despite this small effect it was pointed out that one powerful way to look for an energy - dependent velocity of light is given by gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) @xcite .",
    "grbs are the most luminous electromagnetic events occurring in the universe since the big bang",
    ". they can last from a few milliseconds to minutes , with a typical duration of a couple of seconds @xcite .",
    "however , the main problem we face when looking for qg effects in grb signals is our ignorance of the internal physical processes which are at the origin of the photon emission .",
    "photons with different energies may emanate from different mechanisms , thus further complicating the comparison between events . despite these difficulties several studies were able to put strong constraints on a lorentz invariance violation with grbs @xcite .",
    "in a recent work @xcite a preferred range for the linear qg mass scale of @xmath11 gev could even be found by studying a flare observed by magic .",
    "this result has a sensitivity that probes , for the first time , the planck mass range .    in this work",
    "we shall mainly consider the first - order correction to the speed of light with the conservative bound @xmath12 .",
    "in other words we assume that a lorentz symmetry breaking starts to become important only at the planck scale @xmath13 , resulting in the following relation for the speed of light : @xmath14 the dependence of the speed of light on the energy as described by eq",
    ".   causes a difference in the arrival times between two photons emitted at the same time , but with different energies . assuming a flat universe described by the @xmath15cdm model ( for different models see @xcite ) , the integrated time delay between two photons with an energy difference @xmath16 is given by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 km @xmath21 @xmath22 . at the end of the paper",
    "we will briefly discuss the case of a quadratic correction where the integrated time delay is given by @xmath23    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in we describe the relevant properties of glast and in and our method to create a photon list with arrival times and energies .",
    "is devoted to explaining our results , to giving an estimate of glast to quadratic corrections to the speed of light and to studying non - fred distributions .",
    "we then conclude with .",
    "the gamma ray large area space telescope ( glast ) is a space - based gamma - ray telescope designed to explore the high - energy universe .",
    "it includes two instruments : the large array telescope ( lat ) , which is an imaging gamma - ray detector which detects photons with energy from about 30 mev to 300 gev , and the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) that consists of 14 scintillation detectors which detect photons with an energy between 8 kev and 30 mev .",
    "the lat has a very large field of view that allows it to see about 20% of the sky at any time .",
    "despite the fact that it will cover the entire sky every three hours we shall assume that the instrument response changes on timescales longer than a typical burst duration .",
    "on the other hand , glast can be pointed as needed when a bright grb is detected by either lat or gbm so that it will detect around 200 grbs each year .",
    "the energy resolution ranges from 20% at 30 mev to about 7% at 1 gev , as can be seen in @xcite .",
    "the time resolution of an event should be around 10 @xmath24s with a dead time shorter than @xmath25s . in summary",
    ", lat will have superior area , angular resolution , field of view , time resolution and deadtime .",
    "this will at least provide an advance of a factor 30 in sensitivity compared to previous missions .",
    "the glast science support center ( gssc ) provides analysis tools freely available to the scientific community on their homepage @xcite . as we are interested in simulating the detection of grbs by glast we mainly used the tool called _ gtobssim _ which is a software that generates photon events from astrophysical sources with the instrument response functions of glast . because we will only study the measurement of possible lorentz violation we assumed that lat pointed in the same direction as the burst .",
    "further information on the effects of qg on lat grbs can be found in e.g. @xcite .",
    "mev with an uncertainty of about 10%.,width=226 ]",
    "we shall use the same method we used to study integral grbs by modeling bursts with a fast raise and exponential decay ( fred ) distribution @xcite .",
    "we parameterize this distribution with four parameters : @xmath26 as shown in .",
    "we suppose that a photon @xmath27 came from the probability density function @xmath28 at time @xmath29 with energy @xmath30 .",
    "we use the method of maximum likelihood which consists in finding the set of values @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 that maximizes the joint probability distribution of all data , given by @xmath36 together with the constraint @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the likelihood function and the integral runs between @xmath39 and @xmath40 as shown in .",
    "the specifics of this distribution does not play a significant role in our study as we are only interested in seeking possible violations of the lorentz symmetry . in order to further improve our model we also simulated an isotropic background with a spectrum following an exponential decay with exponent 2.1 .",
    "however , this background does not play a significant role because of the following two reasons .",
    "the first one is that lat shall only be able to detect photons with energies above @xmath41 mev , where such events are rare .",
    "the second one is the fact that we are only interested in grbs , e.g. events of short duration .",
    "the duration of the rise , @xmath42 the height above the background , @xmath43 the decay time for @xmath44 and @xmath45 describes the magnitude of the dependence on the energy of the distribution @xmath28 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the time when the intensity reaches a maximum and @xmath4 is the photon energy .",

    "gtobssim _ for lat .",

    "we choose the high energy exponent @xmath49 ( see eq .  ) and a background with exponent @xmath50,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]   s and has a decay time of the order of 10 seconds . _ right panel _ : spectrum of the same grb as simulated by _",

    "the first detected photons have an energy of roughly 30 mev .",
    "we choose the high energy exponent @xmath49 ( see eq .  ) and a background with exponent @xmath50,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]      as described in the previous section we also need to simulate the energy of the photons .",
    "normally a typical energy distribution of grbs follows the pattern of the so - called band function @xcite given by the following equation : @xmath51 ^{\\alpha-\\beta}\\left ( \\frac{e}{100\\;\\mathrm{kev}}\\right ) ^{\\beta}\\exp(\\beta-\\alpha),\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad(\\alpha-\\beta)e_0\\leq e,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the low - energy exponent , @xmath52 the high - energy one and @xmath53 the break energy .",
    "as lat starts measuring at 30 mev and the break energy is around 500 kev we shall only be interested in the high - energy behavior of the band function .",
    "however , lat will open a new window on the spectrum where little is known , therefore there is no certainty whether the band function is still valid throughout the energy range of lat .    in order to make the simulations as realistic as possible we used _",
    "gtobssim_. as described in the previous section we simulated a grb with photons following a fred distribution together with an isotropic background . since we are only interested in the detection of a possible lorentz violation we used the same fred distribution for all grbs , i.e. with a raise time of the order of a second and a decay time around 10 seconds ( see ) . in order to get a feeling of the uncertainty we varied the flux of the burst and only selected the bursts which got about the same number of hits in the detector .",
    "we then introduced a lorentz violating term with the following relation ( see ): @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the energy of the detected photon in mev and @xmath56 is the time delay in seconds caused by quantum gravity given by the relation @xmath57 .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 describes the effect of a lorentz violation and is given by the following relation : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mass scale where the lorentz symmerty breaks down .",
    "henceforth we shall take the most conservative scale and set @xmath60 gev .",
    "as can be seen in typical values for @xmath45 lie between @xmath61 and @xmath62 s / mev . in the monte carlo simulations we used a value of @xmath63 corresponding to a redshift of @xmath64 .     as a function of the redshift . as we shall see below , a value of @xmath65 s / mev",
    "could even be measured without requiring a bright burst ( see ) .,width=226 ]",
    "we studied two models : one simple one with only the time delays caused by quantum gravity and a more realistic one where we perturbed the energy and the arrival time according to the scheme shown in in order to take into account the energy and time resolution of the lat . for a given event at time",
    "@xmath39 with energy @xmath53 obtained with _",
    "gtobssim _ we read the energy uncertainty @xmath66 from and perturbed this energy with a gaussian with maximum at @xmath53 and standard deviation @xmath67 .",
    "the next step is to take the corrected time @xmath40 and perturb it with a gaussian with maximum at @xmath68 and standard deviation @xmath69 @xmath24s so that we get the perturbed arrival time @xmath70 .     and the energy @xmath53 of a photon .",
    "the arrival time is then corrected by means of the relation   from @xmath39 to @xmath40 ( box qg ) .",
    "the simpler case with only qg effects is shown by the arrow number 1 . in the second case ,",
    "the energy of the photon was perturbed from @xmath53 to @xmath71 with a gaussian distribution with standard deviation according to ( box er ) .",
    "furthermore , the arrival time was perturbed a second time from @xmath40 to @xmath70 with a gaussian distribution with standard deviation of 10 @xmath24s corresponding to the time resolution of lat ( box tr ) .",
    "the photon with arrival time @xmath70 and energy @xmath71 is then given to the fitter ( box fit ) to get a value for the qg corresponding to @xmath45 .",
    ", width=453 ]      in the previous section we explained how we constructed a burst with photons and perturbed their energies and arrival times to account for lorentz violation and finite energy and time resolution of lat .",
    "the question is now whether it is possible to get back the value of @xmath45 parameterizing the lorentz violating term despite the perturbation of both the energy and arrival time .",
    "in @xcite we found an exponential dependence between the standard deviation @xmath72 and the number of detected photons @xmath73 with an exponent of -0.617 .",
    "however , we only perturbed the arrival time and not the energy .",
    "the final step is to search for @xmath74 which minimizes the likelihood . for a single burst we scanned through a large range of @xmath45 in order to find the global ( and not just a local ) minimum of the likelihood .",
    "we performed 100 monte carlo simulations for different luminosities of the bust , i.e. different numbers of total events @xmath73 ( see ) .",
    ".results of 100 monte carlo simulations .",
    "the first column shows the number of photons detected by lat , the second one the approximate flux in @xmath75 .",
    "the third column shows the mean value of @xmath74 for the unperturbed system ( 1 . ) and the fourth one its standard deviation .",
    "the last two columns are the same as the third and fourth ones , except for the fact that the arrival times and energies were perturbed with a gaussian distribution ( see ) . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      in this subsection we are concerned with quadratic corrections given by eq .",
    ". such corrections may be interesting in view of the fact that previous works have already put stringent constraints on linear corrections to the speed of light @xcite . to get a rough estimate of the sensitivity of glast to quadratic corrections",
    "we must first get a bound on the time difference that should be detectable by glast . with eq .",
    "we see that for @xmath76 s / mev ( see ) and @xmath77 mev we get a bound on the time difference of @xmath78 s. solving eq .   for the mass scale and inserting these results",
    "we get a mass scale of @xmath79 for @xmath64 up to which glast should be sensitive for a _ single _ burst . this bound may probably be raised by a couple of orders of magnitude with better statistics .",
    "however , we do not think that glast will be able to detect a quadratic correction if the qg scale is at the planck scale .",
    "the above estimate may seem very crude .",
    "we therefore checked it with results obtained in the literature and found a good agreement between this estimate and a more rigorous statistical analysis .",
    "for example , taking @xmath80 gev obtained in eq .",
    "( 36 ) in @xcite together with @xmath81 kev and @xmath82 s for batse we get a bound on the quadratic correction of @xmath83 gev , which corresponds more or less to the result @xmath84 gev obtained in @xcite with a rigorous analysis .      until now we only considered fred distributions for grbs .",
    "however , despite the fact that these distributions may describe a large number of grbs , we also have to consider other burst shapes in order to get an estimate for the validity of our likelihood method with non - fred distributions .",
    "we studied two other shapes , a linearly raising and falling distribution and a double - peak distribution ( see ) .",
    "we then applied the likelihood method to these peaks with 200 photons and compared the results with for @xmath85 . for the linear peak ( see left panel in ) we found a value @xmath86 s / mev and a standard deviation of @xmath87 s / mev . comparing this value with the perturbed system for @xmath85 ( see ) we see that the likelihood method gives a slightly better results for the linear peak .",
    "we also studied the double peak ( see fight panel in ) and found a value of @xmath88 s / mev with a standard deviation of @xmath89 .",
    "thus the results of both cases lead to the conclusion that our likelihood method is also able to deal with non - fred distributions .",
    "we fixed the duration time of the simulated grbs to about 20 seconds , which seems quite arbitrary .",
    "however , we expect the likelihood to get better as the duration of the burst gets shorter ( as long as the total number of photons remains constant ) .",
    "the reason is that , while @xmath45 is independent of the duration , the ratios @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( see ) are inverse proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "we checked this claim for bursts with a duration time of about 6 seconds , 200 photons and fred - distributed .",
    "we found a value @xmath93 s / mev with a standard deviation of @xmath94 s / mev . comparing this value with we see that the likelihood is able to recover the lorentz violating term with a precision of about one order of magnitude better . on the other hand ,",
    "the convergence of the likelihood decreases with the duration time of the bursts , thus narrowing the study of short bursts to the brighter ones .",
    "as can be seen from values of the lorentz violation parameter @xmath45 of the order of @xmath95 s / mev could theoretically be measurable . in @xcite",
    "the batse catalog was used to build up the statistics for lat .",
    "the authors made the assumption of extrapolating the batse observations to lat energies in order to get a rough estimate on the number of detected bursts each year as a function of the number of photons per burst and the energy threshold ( see table  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "if this assumption is correct we may get a couple of bursts each year that could answer the question whether the lorentz symmetry is violated . nevertheless , as explained above",
    ", the systematics should considerably wash out the signal from a lorentz violating term so that a lot of bursts with known redshifts should be needed to get a tight bound on a lorentz violating term .",
    "even without systematics a number of bursts of the order of 100 still yields an uncertainty of the order of the expected planck corrections , as can be seen from eq .  .    in this work we had to make a couple of simplifications",
    "for example we had to assume that the band function is still valid at lat energies .",
    "in other words , glast will be able to measure the high - energy index at energies out of reach of past and present experiments .",
    "furthermore , we studied the effect of a linear correction to the speed of light and assumed a simultaneous emission of the photons of different energies from the source .",
    "this last assumption is the most problematic one because in @xcite we obtained results for @xmath45 with even different signs for the same burst ( see also e.g. @xcite where the same kind of problems arises ) .",
    "therefore , the unknown emission mechanisms for photon emission should be the major problem in seeking lorentz violation .",
    "this is the reason why either a lot of bursts or a better understanding of the burst mechanism is needed before we can settle down the question whether the lorentz symmetry is violated in nature .",
