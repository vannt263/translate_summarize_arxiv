    "the synthesis of the heavy elements in the universe is one of the important and interesting topics in modern physics .",
    "different processes and astrophysical events are involved in understanding the measured isotopic abundances .",
    "one kind of process is the so - called rapid - neutron capture process ( r - process ) , that gives rise to heavy elements beyond iron in our solar system  @xcite .",
    "the site of this process is still not clear .",
    "one of the popular ideas is the high - entropy wind of core collapse type ii supernovae  @xcite .",
    "the obstacles to the simulation of the r - process are two - fold .",
    "( 1 ) the unclear site gives uncertainties to the astrophysical environmental parameters which are crucial for the initial conditions of the simulations of the r - process evolution , such as the initial neutron richness , the temperature _ etc _  @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) most of the nuclei involved in the evolution are exotic neutron - rich ones which are currently out of the reach of experiments , so their reaction and decay rates are still uncertain . for the r - process",
    "the nuclei are very neutron - rich and some are near the neutron dripline .",
    "the general pattern of solar element abundance shows peaked distributions around @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "surveys  @xcite show that in order to produce these two heavy element peaks , the properties of nuclei around @xmath3 and @xmath4 are important especially those near the proton or neutron magic numbers .",
    "the nuclear chart can be divided into regions near the magic numbers where the low - lying states are best described in a spherical basis , and regions in between the magic numbers where they are best described in a deformed basis .",
    "the qrpa method has been developed for each of these .",
    "there is a transitional region that , at present , must be interpolated in terms of the spherical and deformed limits . in a previous paper we focused on the deformed region of nuclei centered on z=46 and n=66  @xcite . in this work",
    "we will focus on the heavy spherical nuclei near the magic numbers . in these regions ,",
    "some shell - model calculations can be performed with a truncated model space .",
    "early calculations only included gamow - teller ( gt ) decay  @xcite , but recent calculations  @xcite have also included first - forbidden ( ff ) decays which turn out to be important for the @xmath5 isotones  @xcite .",
    "qrpa methods have previously been used , such as the qrpa method with separable forces in  @xcite , the self - consistent qrpa from dft  @xcite and the continuum qrpa  @xcite _ etc_. as an improved alternative , we propose the pn - qrpa method with realistic forces as introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that with the g - matrix obtained from the bethe equations with realistic potentials fitted from the nucleon - nucleon scattering data , one can obtain the full spectrum for the ground as well as excitation states of the odd - odd daughter nuclei .",
    "the full spectrum provides an exact treatment for the excitation energies which are missing in most other qrpa methods .",
    "the inclusion of states with more spin - parities also means that we can deal with the negative parity ff transitions which are missing in some calculations  @xcite .",
    "this article is arranged as follows . in next section the qrpa method and its application",
    "to allowed and forbidden beta decay is outlined .",

    "in this work , we will calculate both the allowed gamow - teller ( gt ) and first forbidden ( ff ) @xmath0-decays for proton - neutron even - even and odd - even nuclear isotones near @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "the half - lives for these decays can be expressed generally as : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the total decay width and is a sum over all the possible decay widths from the ground state of initial parent nucleus to different states of final daughter nucleus with the specific selection rules . for gt decay , the width can be expressed as : @xmath9 the term @xmath10 is the dimensionless phase - space factor depending on @xmath0-decay q value  @xcite , while @xmath11 is a combinations of constants defined as @xmath12 .",
    "the gt strength @xmath13 can be expressed in terms of the reduced matrix element for spherical nuclei @xmath14 , here @xmath15 is the spin of the parent nucleus .",
    "a frequently used quantities here is the log@xmath16 value , which is defined here as log@xmath16=log@xmath17 $ ] with @xmath18 .    for ff decay ,",
    "the expression is more complicated , as in  @xcite : @xmath19 with @xmath20 and with @xmath21 defined as @xmath22 @xmath23 is the electron energy in the unit of electron mass @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the fermi function as expressed in  @xcite and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the nuclear matrix elements depending on the nuclear structure . the detailed expression of these matrix elements are given in eq.(8 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite and eq.(3,4,5 ) in ref .",
    "the log@xmath16 values in this case are defined as log@xmath16=log(@xmath30 ) , here @xmath31 is the phase space factor for gt decay . in this work , for the matrix element calculations , we adopt the pn - qrpa ( proton - neutron quasi - particle random phase approximation ) method .",
    "the concept of quasi - particle starts with the nuclear pairing .",
    "the most common description of pairing in nuclear physics is the bcs formalism . under the bcs formalism",
    ", one can define the quasi - particle operator @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the bcs coefficients solved from bcs equations , and @xmath35 is the single particle creation operator . with the quasi - particle operators , one can define the qrpa phonons as  @xcite : @xmath36 here the two quasi - particle operators are defined as @xmath37_{j^{\\pi}m}$ ] , with @xmath38 , @xmath39 being proton and neutron respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath40 s and @xmath41 s here are the forward and backward amplitudes respectively , they can be derived from the solutions of qrpa - equations  @xcite : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian and the detailed expressions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 with realistic interactions were presented in ref .  @xcite . in this scenario , the different excited states are defined as : @xmath47 with the qrpa phonon @xmath48 acted on even - even vacuum @xmath49 .    for decays of even - even nuclei",
    "we choose the bcs vacuum as the ground state : @xmath50 , here the @xmath51 refer to the eigenvalues of the @xmath52th state from the qrpa solutions in the spherical systems while @xmath53 is the smallest eigenvalues of the solutions .",
    "the effective q values for each state are @xmath54 , where q is the mass difference between the two ground states of parent and daughter nuclei .    to obtain the lifetime , besides the q values",
    ", one also needs the matrix elements in equations [ gt]-[ff ] , for even - even to odd - odd decay .",
    "these can be expressed in our formalism as : @xmath55 here the @xmath56 is the nuclear transition operator for @xmath0-decay .",
    "the reduced matrix elements from the wigner - eckart theorem are independent of m ( the projection of total angular momentum on z axis ) . for the allowed decay , @xmath57 with the selection rule @xmath58 and @xmath59 , while for first - forbidden decay , the expressions of the operators are more complicated ( the detailed forms given in  @xcite ) with the selection rules @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    for decays of odd - even nuclei , one has an unpaired nucleon , the simplest scenario is that given in ref .",
    "one quasi - particle or one quasi - particle plus one qrpa - phonon acts on the bcs vacuum ( the spectator mode in  @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the single quasi - particle excitations , the correction from the coupling between the single quasi - particle and the qrpa - phonon was taken into consideration with the assumption of the weak coupling limit . in our calculation",
    "we find that this correction gives only small changes .",
    "since it takes a much longer time for the calculation , we neglect this effect in the present calculation .",
    "we have two kinds of states for odd - even nuclei .",
    "first , the single particle state as given by : @xmath62 can be either proton or neutron .",
    "the ground states of the parent nuclei are chosen to be the one with the lowest quasi - particle energies , and this also holds for the even - odd daughter nuclei .",
    "for all the other single quasi - particle excitations , the relative excitation energies to the ground state are @xmath63 .",
    "another kind of states for the daughter nuclei is the quasi - particle plus phonon state mentioned above without the possible mixing between then : @xmath64 the energies of such states are determined as follows .",
    "if we compare such states with the odd - odd nuclei , the only difference is the spectator single quasi particle , the difference of excitation energies in the two systems is simply equivalent to the difference of the q values in these two systems ( corresponding the difference of the ground states ) , this gives @xmath65 .",
    "the matrix elements for @xmath0-decay of odd - even nuclei to these two different kinds of final states can be written as : @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 the same form as for the even - even case .    with these derived excitation energies and matrix elements ,",
    "we can calculate the beta decay properties with the results presented in the next sections .",
    ".the experimental @xmath69 energies and corresponding log@xmath16 values of the largest decay branch are listed here for different even - even cd isotopes , also the corresponding half - lives are shown .",
    "a comparison between the experimental measurements and theoretical calculations has been made with quenching factors @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath71 is the axial - vector - coupling constant for free neutrons . [",

    "two overall factors are introduced , namely @xmath72 ( for the particle - hole channel ) and @xmath73 ( for the particle - particle channel ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 mainly determines the position of the giant gamow - teller resonance ( gtr ) .",
    "since there is no coupling between the gtr and the low - lying states the gt beta decay to low - lying states is not affected by the value of @xmath72 .",
    "although for large @xmath74 values some of the decay could go to the lower part of the gtr .",
    "this contributes little to the total decay width due to their higher energies , but it could be important for the beta delayed neutron decay branches . a value of @xmath72=1 which reproduces the experimental energy is adopted here .",
    "the other parameter , @xmath73 , affects the energies of low - lying excited states and the gt matrix elements to these states .",
    "the @xmath69 excitation energies are sensitive to the value of @xmath73 . for nuclei near n=82 , @xmath73 values around @xmath75 best reproduce details energy levels ( see table [ cd ] ) . for nuclei near n=126",
    "there is limited data on the final state energies ( especially for @xmath69 ) , as we shall show later , with the quenching values we chose seems to agree with the experimental results , we find @xmath76 better reproduces the half - lives .",
    "these parameters are obtained for the even - even nuclei , and for consistency the same values are used in odd - mass nuclei .    in this work ,",
    "we also introduce a quenching effect since our calculations show an overall underestimation of half - lives compared with the experimental measurements for cases where there is good agreement for excitation energies .",
    "this quenching of the qrpa calculations for the spherical nuclei may have two origins .",
    "the gt strengths obtained with shell - model calculations in the @xmath77 shell  @xcite and @xmath78 shell  @xcite are systematically larger than experiment by about a factor of two .",
    "the  quenching \" of experiment relative to theory by about a factor of 0.5 is consistent with results obtained by second - order perturbation theory corrections that take into account the excitation of nucleons outside of these model spaces  @xcite .",
    "secondly , in spherical qrpa calculation , only one - phonon excitations have been taken into account , while shell - model calculations show that there exists the mixing between the single- and multi - phonon states .",
    "two kinds of mixing outside of our model could be present : the low - lying part mixes with the gtr which shifts strength to higher energy ; and the charge conserving 1p-1h excitations coupled with charge exchange gt excitations which spreads the gt strength and shifts some of the strength to higher energies . we determine the quenching empirically by comparing the calculated log@xmath16 values and half - lives with the experimental ones for the cd isotopes .",
    "the results are shown in table [ cd ] .",
    "the log@xmath16 values are for individual final states , while the half - lives take into account the decay to all final states ( gt is the dominate decay mode ) .",
    "a choice of @xmath79 generally reproduces the half - lives .",
    "the largest difference comes from @xmath80cd due to the fact that we predict a smaller excitation energy compared to experiment . from this comparison",
    ", we adopt the value of @xmath81 for the gt calculation as an optimal choice in our calculation for both @xmath6 and @xmath5 regions .",
    "compared to the simple operator @xmath82 operator for gt decays , the ff operators are more complicated with several different spin - parity combinations .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the tensor part of the @xmath83 to @xmath84 ff operator is enhanced due to mesonic - exchange currents . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we use an enhancement factor@xmath85 . in general , we could use different quenchings for the other types of ff operators as was done for the shell - model calculations of ref .",
    "however , this is quite complicated and even with least - square fits in table .",
    "i of ref .",
    "@xcite , we still see some large deviations , we can not simply use the same quenching adopted in the shell - model approach since the origins of quenching for the shell - model and qrpa are different . for the shell model it comes from the model - space truncation ( with a rather small model space compared with qrpa calculation ) ,",
    "while for qrpa , it is from the configuration - space truncation ( only one - phonon excitations have been taken into account in qrpa ) . in this sense ,",
    "different queching schemes should be used . for simplicity",
    "we use an overall quenching factor for all the ff operator and we vary this value to find the best agreement to a rather limited set of data .    the quenching factors @xmath86 and @xmath87 for ff transitions are obtained this way by comparing the theory to experiment for some relatively strong ff transitions to low - lying states . in table [ ff82ee ] , the comparison between experiment and theory with and without the chosen quenching factors for the decay of te and xe isotopes is shown . without quenching , there is a general underestimation about @xmath88 in the log@xmath16 values .",

    "when experimental single - particle energies are used the transition is dominated by the @xmath94 to @xmath95 contribution and we obtain log@xmath16=5.11 ( with quenching ) compared to the experimental value of 5.02 . in general , our qrpa approach is not very good for cases with one or two nucleons removed from the double - magic nuclei where the pairing is weak and the bcs solution sometimes overestimates the pairing effect . also transitions to a few low - lying states are sensitive to the precise value of the single - particle energies .",

    "@xcite for which there are systematic overestimation of half - lives on the even - even isotones compared with other methods for the high z ( low q ) isotones .",
    "this is due to their over - estimation of the excitation energies and underestimation of the matrix elements due to the lack of particle - particle interactions for qrpa .",
    "this results in an odd - even staggering behaviors for the half - lives in separable - force calculations .",

    "@xcite , the general discrepancy among different methods for most nuclei is within a factor of two .",

    "while comparing with the experiments , our method underestimates the half - lives for @xmath96 in and @xmath80cd , especially for the former .",
    "the reason for this is that the bcs method does not work well near the doubly - magic nuclei where the pairing is weak and the bcs solution sometimes overestimates the pairing effect as we mentioned previously .",
    "for @xmath80cd the reason for the disagreement is due to the energy of @xmath97 state being too low compared to experiment as seen in table [ cd ] .",

    "the two shell model calculations give similar results for the half - lives .",
    "the difference for the two shell - model calculations comes from the different quenching factors and model space they adopted that produces a nearly small constant difference within a factor of about two . in our calculations , there is difference of less than a factor of two with the two different mass models .",

    "we predict lower @xmath99 values than the other calculations , especially for the even - even nuclei . for @xmath80cd , our result is smaller than the experimental value of 3.5% . in this case",

    "our low @xmath99 value indicates that the qrpa gt distribution in the region of 8 mev is not spread out enough due to the lack of coupling with particle - hole states . the frdm+qrpa(sep . )",
    "@xcite seems to have better predictions for the @xmath99 values , but this comes from the fact that the energy of the lowest @xmath69 state is too high in this case as they predict a much longer half - life for this nucleus , that is , about four times larger than the experimental half - life .",
    "the same situation happens for the @xmath5 isotones ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ pncmp ] ) .",
    "the differences among the calculations are quite large for even - even isotones , while there is better agreement for the odd - even cases . in the region",
    "@xmath100 , the @xmath99 values are close to @xmath101 .",
    "this can be important for the r - process evolution .",
    "the shell - model calculation  @xcite predicts larger @xmath99 values than most other calculations for both @xmath6 and @xmath5 cases , the reason for this is that in shell - model calculations , due to their large configuration space , the strength is fragmented compared with qrpa calculations and more strength has been distributed above the neutron separation energy threshold . in order to see the importance of inclusion of the first - forbidden part , we compared the ratios of ff part to the overall decay width in fig .",
    "[ ffcmp ] . for @xmath6 , except ref .",
    "@xcite ( as they havent calculated the ff parts explicitly ) , the three methods ( qrpa , cqrpa and shell model ) predict generally similar ratios .",
    "we have lower ff ratios which are close to those from cqrpa for high z and higher ff ratios which are close to shell - model calculations for low z nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "this ratio is about the same for the two mass models in our calculation there is a systematic difference between the cqrpa and shell - model calculations and our results are in between . in general , for the @xmath6 isotonic chain , all the calculations show that the first - forbidden part plays a less important role in @xmath0-decay . however , this is not the case for the @xmath5 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ ffcmp ] ) isotonic chain , where there are large discrepancies among different methods .",
    "we obtain ff ratios that decrease with z in contrast to the other methods where they increase . comparing our results carefully with those of fig .",
    "16 in ref.@xcite , we found the difference comes from the fact that the two methods have different gt strength distributions .",
    "although the excitation energies for @xmath69 states are similar ( around 2 mev for both methods for three nuclei @xmath102er,@xmath103yb and @xmath104hf ) , the structures of these states are different . in qrpa calculation , we see an small increase of the energies for the first @xmath69 states as the proton number increase , but the energies of the @xmath69 states which give dominant contribution to the gt decay however decrease sharply with the increasing proton number .",
    "this is not seen in shell - model calculations .",
    "this means that there may be too much strength presented in the low - lying states for n=126 isotones with higher z due to the configuration space truncations .",
    "but on the other hand , shell - model calculations have too limited model space and could result in this different behaviors of gt strength distributions as well .",
    "although ref .",
    "@xcite has also a very large ff ratio , compared with the same method in ref .",
    "@xcite , this would be just due to a wrongly accounting of parameters in their calculations and their ff ratios for low z isotones may need some updates .",
    "on the other hand we see that in the two shell - model calculations , the different quenchings and model spaces also give some different ratios as they have similar quenching for the gt part .",
    "so as explained above , the difference between our calculation and the shell - model calculations may came from two aspects , the different configuration space and the different model space , and further investigation is needed to explain the discrepancy for the ratios of ff parts .",
    "the advantage of qrpa methods is that we can calculate with a larger model space more nuclei than those on the magic number line as in the shell model calculations .",
    "so we present more results around the magic number vicinity for even - end nuclei .",
    "first , we present the q value sets we use in our calculation in fig .",
    "as mentioned above , we adopt the q values if they are available from experimental measurements as those in  @xcite .",
    "otherwise , we use two mass models for the sake of comparison , the frdm  @xcite mass model come from the macroscopic droplet models and the hfb21  @xcite model from self - consistent microscopic hartree - fock - boglyubov calculations . from fig .",
    "[ q82 ] , we see that around the neutron number @xmath105 , the q - values obtained from the two mass tables are basically the same for most even - even nuclei while there are @xmath106 differences for most odd - even ones , generally frdm predicts smaller q - values except for those nuclei with lower z. however , for @xmath6 and @xmath107 , the contrary happens and frdm generally predicts larger q - values . as for @xmath108 , the same situation happens as for @xmath6 , large difference occurs at low z. as for @xmath5 and @xmath109 , the discrepancy from the two mass models becomes irregular .",
    "we calculated the half - lives of the isotones with the two mass models and the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ t82v ] . for @xmath11080 , 82 , 84 isotones ,",
    "we make comparison with those results in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as some experimental values . when compared with the experimental results , we find very good agreement . in general",
    ", the agreement gets better when the nuclei are far away from the proton magic number @xmath111 .",
    "the results with @xmath105 and 84 has the same trends as n=82 we analyzed previously . compared with results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we would see the same behaviour of overestimation of even - even nuclei in their calculation with moderate q values .",
    "when the q value increases the results in both calculations get closer and for much larger q values , ref.@xcite predicts shorter half - lives than ours .",
    "the reason for this is due to the different treatments of the excitation energies . in ref .",
    "@xcite , qrpa energies have been used directly as the excitation energies , which are in fact about several mev higher than the actual excitation energies .",
    "although the strength spreading has been introduced , even without the quenching effect , the deviation is still large . if q values are large , then the effect from this difference between qrpa and excitation energies is weakened .",
    "meanwhile the quenching reduces our decay strength and make our predicted half - lives longer than theirs . while in the case of odd nuclei , the single particle transition may play dominant role for low - lying states , we would not see this large deviation of half - lives for isotones with large proton numbers ( z ) .",
    "generally , for low q values , deviation occurs for even - even nuclei and agreement is achieved for odd - even nuclei , and for large q values , we have longer half - lives due to the inclusion of quenching .",
    "if we compare the results obtained for the two mass models , we see that for the same nuclei , large q value shortens the half - life .",
    "however , exceptions do exist as the mass model also affect the empirical gap parameters and hence change the structure indirectly . such as the case of @xmath112cd ,",
    "with the same q value we have a small difference with two mass sets due to the different gap parameters we obtained .",
    "different mass sets produce different half - lives and their impact on r - process is to be investigated .",
    "also , the smoothing behavior of the half - lives on the proton number z depends on the mass set one chooses .",
    "a choice of mass sets may produce the unwanted even - odd staggering behavior .",
    "it is somehow hard to tell , whether the staggering comes from the microscopic approaches or the q value sets , due to the uncertainty of the theory .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn on @xmath108 , 126 , 128 .",
    "one has only limited experimental data in this region , and the agreement for these limited data with the calculations are very poor , as the q values for these nuclei are very small . for @xmath110124 and 126 , with the increasing q values , our calculation tends to agree with calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite for odd mass nuclei , but for n=128 , the deviations always exist .",
    "in general , the different mass sets produce a deviation less than a factor of two close to the deviations produced from different methods we discussed for n=126 isotonic chain .    as for another measurable @xmath99 , we have even less experimental data for comparison .",
    "our calculation has smaller @xmath99 values compared with experiments , but the deviation is not large especially when @xmath99 is close to @xmath101 . for @xmath105 and 82 ,",
    "the @xmath99 values increase as the decrease of proton numbers . for very neutron - rich nuclei ,",
    "the beta - decay is followed immediately with neutron emissions .",
    "we see an odd - even staggering behavior as previously found in shell - model calculations .",
    "the deviation between our results and those from ref  @xcite is large in magnitude but keeps the same trends ( the reason of this has been explained above as the strength has been shifted to high - energies region systematically in their calculations ) .",
    "however , the two sets of results seem to agree with each other when @xmath113 .",
    "this is because the neutron separation energies here are pretty smaller , nearly all the strength lies in the window between @xmath114 and q. when one crosses the magic number line @xmath6 , there appear increased @xmath99 values as the nuclei here become less stable against the neutron emission , which agrees with results in ref .  @xcite . for the heavier nuclei region with n around 126 ,",
    "the neutron emission probability hasnt been measured for any nuclei .",
    "the general trends here for the two calculations again keeps the same while they differ in numbers as above .",
    "the nuclei beyond the neutron magic number @xmath5 show the large @xmath99 values as for the region of @xmath115 .    due to the drawbacks of the qrpa methods ,",
    "limited accuracy has been obtained especially for @xmath99 values .",
    "but one could see some improvements of the qrpa calculations , the half - lives are closer to the experimental values as well as those by shell model calculations compared with results in@xcite . for regions where shell - model calculations are absent , the decent results have been obtained . to further improve the predicted @xmath99 values , the strength spreading from multi - phonon effect",
    "could be introduced such as those from the particle - vibration couplings  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we calculated the weak decay properties of even proton number isotones near the neutron magic numbers 82 and 126 with the spherical qrpa method with realistic forces .",
    "our results agree well with other calculations on the neutron magic number chains 82 and 126 .",
    "we give the predictions for more nuclei in these region and compared with results in ref .",
    "different mass models have been used for the sake of comparison , and they produce a moderate difference for the final results . in general , we make some improvements on the accuracy of decay rates compared with ref .",
    "@xcite and its impact on the r - process simulations are to be investigated .",
