    "there are several reasons why polarized mller scattering has attracted so much interest from both experimental and theoretical communities .",
    "the scattering of two identical polarized fermions has been used in many laboratories for the high - precision determination of the electron - beam polarization , including slc in @xcite , e-143 @xcite and e-154 @xcite experiments at slac , and several experiments at jlab @xcite and mit - bates @xcite .",
    "a mller polarimeter may also be of use in future experiments planned at ilc @xcite .",
    "an experiment e-158 at slac @xcite , which studied mller scattering of 45- to 48-gev polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons of a hydrogen target , allowed one of the important parameters in the standard model - sine of the weinberg angle - to be determined with an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "the new - generation experiment at 11 gev soon to be started at jlab will offer a new level of sensitivity and measure the parity - violating asymmetry in the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons off unpolarized electrons to a precision of 0.73 ppb . that would allow a measurement of the weak charge of the electron to a fractional accuracy of 2.3% and a determination of the weak mixing angle with an uncertainty of @xmath1 0.00026 ( stat . )",
    "@xmath1 0.00013 ( syst . ) @xcite .",
    "since @xmath0 scattering is a very clean process with well - known initial energy and extremely suppressed backgrounds , any inconsistency with the standard model will signal new physics .",
    "mller scattering experiments can provide indirect access to physics at multi - tev scales and play important complementary role to the lhc research program @xcite .",
    "obviously , before we can extract reliable information from experimental data , it is necessary to take into account higher order effects .",
    "these are the processes which are more complicated than the process being studied , but which are indistinguishable from it experimentally .",
    "this procedure of the inclusion of radiative corrections is an indispensable part of any modern experiment , but will be of the most paramount importance for the ultra - precise measurement of the weak mixing angle via 11 gev mller scattering planned at jlab .",
    "one of the earliest works on electroweak radiative corrections ( ewc ) to the observables of mller scattering was done by czarnecki and marciano @xcite . according to their calculations for the asymmetry in the e-158 kinematical region , the ewc reduce the tree level prediction by 40@xmath13% .",
    "a close value of the asymmetry was obtained in the study of denner and pozzorini @xcite , where radiative corrections in polarized mller scattering were examined at arbitrary , including high , energies .",
    "it is worth noticing that these two studies used different renormalization schemes : @xcite employed the modified minimal - subtraction scheme and @xcite used the on - shell renormalization .",
    "however , the authors of @xcite and @xcite did not take into account all radiative contributions consistently .",
    "for example , they completely disregarded the hard photon bremsstrahlung ( hpb ) contribution assuming that it was small .",
    "the first computation of the hpb contributions with realistic experimental cuts was done by petriello @xcite who studied a total set of the lowest - order ewc under kinematical conditions of e-158 experiment .",
    "he clearly showed that experimental cuts play a significant role .",
    "later works @xcite , @xcite and @xcite dedicated to the ewc for the e-158 experiment which employed a covariant method for extracting of infrared divergences @xcite showed a good agreement with @xcite for the bulk of weak - interaction contributions and proved that the effect of hpb was below the experimental error of e-158 .    electromagnetic radiative corrections , which dominate weak interaction effects at the energies of e-158 , and their effect on the measurement of beam polarization in a mller polarimeter were assessed in @xcite .",
    "a different calculation of these electromagnetic corrections was undertaken in @xcite , where attention was primarily given to the effect of experimental cuts on the inelasticity and , accordingly , proving the need for taking into account hard - photon bremsstrahlung in experiments of this kind . a monte carlo generator that makes it possible to simulate radiative events in a mller process at moderate energies with the aim of determining beam polarization",
    "was developed in @xcite .",
    "finally , an attempt to calculate the hard bremsstrahlung contribution for mller process at high energies was made in paper @xcite .",
    "a feature specific to this calculation , as well as to the calculations in @xcite and @xcite , was the use of a parameter @xmath2 that separates regions of soft and hard photons .",
    "as a result , the monte carlo integration technique permitted the development of a code which made it possible to take into account radiative corrections in the case of arbitrary cuts imposed on the detection of electrons .",
    "although obviously significant theoretical effort has been already dedicated to this task , we can see at least three major reasons for addressing ewc to mller scattering yet again .",
    "first , since the new experiment at jlab will provide more precise information than , for example , e-158 , the theoretical predictions for this ultra - precise measurement must be made with a full treatment of one - loop radiative corrections and at least leading two - loop corrections . in this work , we calculated the full set of the one - loop corrections both numerically with no simplifications using feynarts and formcalc @xcite as the base languages and analytically in a compact form useful for fast estimations .",
    "this way , we can control an accuracy of asymptotic approximations at the one - loop level very well now , so we hope that the same idea will help us to control our accuracy as we calculate leading corrections at two - loop level in the nearest future .",
    "the next major goal of the presented paper is to get ewc in a form which is analytically free from nonphysical parameters . and ,",
    "finally , we believe that the complexity of the problem demands the tuned comparison with different calculation schemes",
    ". this will be our next task .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic notations as well as the lowest - order ( born ) contribution to moller scattering are presented in section ii .",
    "the contribution from a full set of additional virtual particles ( such as self - energies , vertices and boxes ) is described in section iii .",
    "the real photon emission and its separation on hard and soft parts as well as cancellation of the infrared divergences together with the unphysical parameters can be found in section iv .",
    "the numerical analysis is presented in section v and appendix b.",
    "in the standard model , the born cross section for the mller scattering @xmath3 can be represented in the form @xmath4 , \\label{cs0}\\ ] ] with @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scattering angle of the detected electron with the 4-momentum @xmath7 in the center of mass system of the initial electrons and the 4-momenta of initial ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and final ( @xmath7 and @xmath10 ) electrons ( see fig .  [",

    "cc    ( 60,60 ) ( -150,-60 )    &    ( 60,100 ) ( -20,-60 )    a useful structure in the present study is @xmath17 which depends on the @xmath18-boson mass @xmath19 and on the photon mass @xmath20 .",
    "the photon mass is set to zero everywhere with the exception of specially indicated cases where the photon mass is taken to be an infinitesimal parameter that regularizes an infrared divergence .",
    "another set of useful functions is @xmath21 which are combinations of coupling constants and @xmath22 , where @xmath22 are the degrees of polarizations of electrons with 4-momentum @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "specifically , they are given by @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 it should be recalled that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the sine ( cosine ) of the weinberg angle expressed in terms of the @xmath18- and @xmath28-boson masses according to the rules of the standard model : @xmath29    the electron polarization degrees @xmath22 in the cross sections are labeled here as follows : the subscripts @xmath30 and @xmath31 on the cross sections correspond to @xmath22 = @xmath32 and @xmath22 = @xmath33 , where the first subscript indicates the degree of polarization for the 4-momentum @xmath8 , while the second one indicates the degree of polarization for the 4-momentum @xmath9 . by combining the degrees of electron beam polarizations ,",
    "we can obtain four measurable cross sections , but , by virtue of the rotational invariance , the two of them will be identical : @xmath34 . from the three cross sections we can construct three independent asymmetries @xcite ( which are very close at large scattering angles ) , and the two of them ( mainly @xmath35 ) are main subject of our investigation : @xmath36 @xmath37    all of the asymmetries are proportional to the combination @xmath38 ( by virtue of the proportionality of the cross - section difference @xmath39 ) and are therefore highly sensitive to small changes in @xmath40 .",
    "this is precisely the reason why the asymmetry @xmath35 , which , at moderately low energies , is given by @xmath41 was used as the observable in the e-158 and will be measured in the future experiment at jlab with 11 gev electrons .",
    "in addition to a fact that the asymmetry @xmath35 is a parity - violating observable , this asymmetry has yet another remarkable property based on its structure : it only involves combinations @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which can be interpreted as the cross sections for the scattering of electrons having the polarizations of @xmath44 and @xmath45 on unpolarized electrons .",
    "frequently , @xmath35 is said to be a single - polarization asymmetry , in contrast to the asymmetry constructed as @xmath46 which consists of the cross sections for the scattering of electrons having different polarizations .",
    "the latter asymmetry , which conserves parity , is the most important observable in determining the electron - beam polarization with the aid of a mller polarimeter .",
    "the contribution of virtual particles ( @xmath47-contribution ) to the observables of moller scattering is described by three classes of diagrams ( see fig .  [ 2f ] ) : boson self - energies ( bse ) , vertex functions , and two - boson exchange ( boxes ) . in the on - shell renormalization schemes which we use here",
