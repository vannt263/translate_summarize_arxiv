    "the value of @xmath252 decreases with decreasing temperature , resulting in @xmath257 at @xmath258 k. another reason for this discrepancy should be the fact that the ratio @xmath259 plays important role as well ; namely , for @xmath260 fixed , the increase of @xmath3 transforms the q1d electronic system into an anisotropic 2d system , where the dimerization along the @xmath30-axis becomes less important . as illustrated in the inset of the figure , for @xmath252 small enough , the gap opens only on a part of the fermi surface resulting for @xmath261 in a local maximum at @xmath262 . on the contrary , for @xmath263 and @xmath243 k ,",
    "the correlation gap develops on the complete fermi surface , with the bare group velocity @xmath264 in the effective number of conduction electrons replaced by the `` renormalized '' one , @xmath265 , with approximately @xmath266 .",
    "the number @xmath267 is affected by the correlations in the same way as @xmath268 . while the rest of the @xmath223 total spectral weight , i.e. the difference between the dashed and solid ( dotted ) line in the inset of fig .",
    "3 , reappears through the coherent excitations across the correlation gap @xmath269 , for @xmath224 there is no counterpart of these coherent finite - frequency excitations .",
    "therefore , to fulfil the @xmath224 conductivity sum rule , one has to go beyond the optical model ( [ eq25])([eq26 ] ) , and to take also incoherent optical processes in the @xmath270 direction into account @xcite .",
    "obviously , this issue is of a general importance for the complete quantitative description of the optical conductivity of the bechgaard salts , and should be in relation with the disappearance of the plasma edge in the @xmath224 reflectivity spectra of the ( tmttf)@xmath5 salts @xcite .      besides the dramatic dependence on the crossover parameter @xmath252 , the optical model ( [ eq25])([eq26 ] ) exhibits also various temperature - dependent features , due to the competition between the energies @xmath272 , @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",
    "some of these temperature effects are at first sight similar to the anomalies ( i)(iv ) mentioned in section 1 .",
    "interestingly , they are more directly related to different mir optical features observed in various other q1d and 2d systems . to compare briefly the predictions of the model with the mir spectra measured in the cdw systems in the ordered ground state @xcite , as well as in the normal metallic state of the underdoped high-@xmath271 cuprates @xcite , we apply it now to the insulating @xmath262 , @xmath229 case .",
