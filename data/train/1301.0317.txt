    "interlacing pixels from input images which have 0.5 pixel offsets ( by design in 3d - hst and rounded for candels - primo ) results in a one - to - one correspondence between input and output pixels ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the models of bright objects with @xmath20 are refined based on their observed spectra , while fainter objects are assumed to have continua flat in units of @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , emission lines in fainter galaxies are not included in the contamination model .    to generate a deep 2d spectrum from all udf grism integrations ,",
    "we first extract two - dimensional spectra from each visit .",
    "these spectra are aligned in two dimensions to the nearest pixel in the subsampled grid and the aligned pixels are then combined with inverse variance weights including a term to down - weight contaminated pixels .",

    "this slight overestimation of the errors by @xmath26 is significantly lower than the factors of 6070% that result from typical applications of the drizzle algorithm @xcite .",
    "slitless  grism spectra offer a distinct advantage compared to ground - based data for detecting weak emission line features : the 2d spectrum provides an image of the galaxy at the wavelength of the emission line ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the morphology of the galaxy is known a priori from the deep broad - band wfc3 imaging .",
    "as long as the emission line morphology and the broad - band morphology are similar ( which is generally the case at @xmath29 ; @xcite ) , or the line contributes significantly to the broad - band flux ( which is the case here ; see below ) , we can search for features in the 2d spectrum whose morphology corresponds to that of the broad - band image .",
    "while there are no obvious emission lines in the raw 2d spectrum , there is a clump of pixels at @xmath30 m which is marginally enhanced compared to its surroundings . to improve the signal - to - noise of this feature , we cross -",
    "correlate the 2d spectrum with a kernel defined by the central @xmath31 of the deep @xmath2 thumbnail of .",
    "this kernel is constructed by extracting kernels for each of the individual udf / g141 visits with different orientations and combining them weighting by the median error in their corresponding 2d grism spectra .",
    "thus , the object profile is slightly smoothed but will reflect the 2d morphology of lines in the stacked spectrum .",
    "the cross - correlation spectrum is shown in the right - hand panels of fig.[f : spec6001 ] , and the strength of the feature at 1.6  @xmath4 is enhanced compared to the raw 2d spectrum .",
    "we verified that the weak feature is not visible in a similar analysis of any single udf / g141 visit , confirming that the feature does not arise from a flux excess in one of them individually , such as a group of hot pixels or an un - flagged cosmic ray .",
    "we show a one - dimensional spectrum extracted along the trace in fig.[f : oned_extraction ] .",
    "we compute an associated uncertainty at each pixel along the trace , highlighted in blue , by cross - correlating the squared error array with the same @xmath2 kernel .",
    "furthermore , we compute a 2d model spectrum as in fig.[f : spec6001 ] with known position and integrated line flux , and extract its cross correlation spectrum in the same way as the observed spectrum .",

    "the probability of finding a gaussian noise feature with equal or greater significance is @xmath3310% for 30 independent resolution elements ( @xmath333000 ) .",
    "there are regions in the 2d cross - correlation spectrum with apparently similar significance to the feature at 1.6 @xmath4 .",
    "many of them can be rejected because they do not fall precisely along the trace of the grism spectrum .",
    "there are enhancements found near the trace at @xmath35 and @xmath36 , though these wavelengths suffer from higher contamination perhaps consisting of faint emission lines not included in the contamination model .",
    "the /wfc3 broad - band photometry places strong constraints on the possibility that these lines come from : either of the bluer lines alone would result in @xmath37 or @xmath38 two magnitudes brighter than the @xmath27 hudf12 limits .    in contrast , the @xmath34 line is consistent with the hudf12 photometry . within the same @xmath39 aperture",
    "used to measure the line flux , we measure @xmath40 for the @xmath2 kernel .",
    "this is 27% brighter than the @xcite magnitude measured within an @xmath41 aperture , but is only 73% of the total magnitude measured by @xcite .",
    "these differences are consistent with aperture corrections of the extended source , which shows a faint extended tail to the ne in the @xmath2 image @xcite .",
    "a pure emission line with the observed flux would result in @xmath42 ; the line accounts for @xmath6% ( 1@xmath3 ) of the @xmath2 flux .",
    "this corresponds to a ( 1,2)@xmath3 limit on the observed - frame equivalent width of the line of @xmath43 .",
    "we test our technique by analyzing faint lines of another udf galaxy with a secure redshift , ( right panels of fig.[f : oned_extraction ] ) .",
    "this galaxy has @xmath44 and unambiguous emission lines of h@xmath8 and at @xmath45 visible in the stacked 2d spectrum before cross - correlation . using the cross - correlation technique we find a significant detection of h@xmath46 even though the line is barely visible in the original spectrum .",
    "two spurious features are detected at 1.24@xmath47 m and @xmath48 m with comparable flux as the tentative line in .",
    "these are both clearly associated with residual contamination from another source at the top of the 2d spectrum .",
    "the h@xmath8 line flux of  is @xmath49 , just three times brighter than the  emission line .",
    "the detection significance is s / n@xmath3310 and the cross - correlation technique enhances the detection significance by a factor of two compared to simple photometry along the trace within an equivalent @xmath50 aperture .",
    "this example demonstrates that the cross - correlation technique works and is able to recover extremely faint emission lines .",
    "if the galaxy is at @xmath52 , as is suggested based on its strong photometric break between the @xmath5 and @xmath2 filters @xcite , the line  if real  can be identified as ly-@xmath8 redshifted to @xmath9 .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent width of ly-@xmath8 would not be unreasonably high at @xmath53  ( accounting for the @xmath17 lyman break in @xmath2 ) ; such values can be reached in young , low metallicity starbursts at high redshift @xcite",
    ". however , such strong ly-@xmath8 emission might be unexpected early in the reionization epoch when the neutral fraction is high ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "more to the point , if the line is real it can account for most or all of the @xmath2 flux , meaning that the photometric break does not necessarily reflect a strong continuum break and the photometric redshift is unreliable .",
    "therefore the line could also be a longer - wavelength feature at much lower redshift , a possibility discussed by @xcite .",
    "although we can not exclude other low redshift identifications such as [ ] at @xmath55 or h@xmath8 at @xmath56 , a likely possibility is that the line is  at @xmath57 .",
    "a population of extreme [ ] emission line galaxies at @xmath58 was recently identified by @xcite from their significant line contribution to the @xmath59 photometry in the candels survey .",
    "additional galaxies with [ ] rest - frame equivalent widths reaching 2000  have been identified in wfc3 grism spectroscopy by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the strongest emitters in @xcite have @xmath60 , with [ ] in the @xmath59 band . while such colors can mimic those of high - redshift dropout galaxies @xcite , even more extreme equivalent widths at @xmath613000  ( rest - frame )",
    "are required to reach @xmath62 observed for .      we have discovered a very bright example of such an extreme emission line galaxy in g141 grism observations of the egs field ( go-12547 , pi : cooper ) .",
    "this remarkable object , egs - xew-1 , located at @xmath8=14:17:58.2 , @xmath64=+52:31:35 and shown in fig.[f : egs_blob ] , is an `` [ ] blob '' at @xmath63 with @xmath65 and a complex morphology comprised of diffuse ( a ) and compact ( b ) components separated by 1@xmath66 .",
    "the exposure times and dithered pixel sampling for the cooper et  al .",
    "grism program are nearly identical to those of 3d - hst , and the spectra were processed with the 3d - hst interlacing software as described above .",
    "the diffuse component , which is extended over more than 1@xmath66 ( 8.5 kpc ) , has a combined observed - frame equivalent width of nearly 9000  for the blended h@xmath46 and  emission lines .",
    "the more compact component has ew=@xmath67 .",
    "the broad - band sed of egs - xew-1 is compared to that of  in the right panel of fig.[f : egs_blob ] .",
    "the spectral break that results from a line such as the one observed in egs - xew-1 is just large enough to satisfy the 2@xmath3 limit on the @xmath68 dropout color of .",
    "however , if  had exactly the same spectrum as egs - xew-1 , the [ ] @xmath693727 line would probably be detected in the bluer wfc3 hudf12 photometry .",
    "interestingly , egs - xew-1 has much redder uv colors than @xmath70 observed for the high equivalent width starbursts at similar redshifts @xcite , which , if also true for , could help explain the lack of @xmath71 ly-@xmath8 observed for that source @xcite . while not a perfect match , egs - xew-1 provides a directly - observed route to a plausible low - redshift interpretation for the  photometry .",
    "we have described a deep  grism spectrum of the candidate @xmath17 galaxy . using the known emission line morphology to increase the line sensitivity of the slitless grism spectrum",
    ", we detect a tentative emission line at @xmath28 with flux  and observed - frame equivalent width @xmath72 .",
    "while the current observations do not conclusively forbid the @xmath17 interpretation of , a number of independent factors conspire to suggest that the 2.7@xmath3 line is in fact real and that the true redshift of  is @xmath73 .",
    "first , the line is observed at just the right wavelength and flux to satisfy both the hudf @xmath2 detection and the @xmath741.4 mag dropout at @xmath75 in the bluer  bands .",
    "if the feature were observed just 4 pixels ( 93 ) bluer it would violate the constraints on @xmath5 by a magnitude .",
    "second , @xcite demonstrate that without a significant contribution of ly-@xmath8 to the @xmath2 flux , the implied rest - frame uv luminosity for @xmath52 is some 20@xmath76 higher than would be expected from the evolution of the luminosity function at @xmath7710 .",
    "third , recent deep spectroscopic surveys of photometric dropouts find a decreasing fraction ly-@xmath8 emitters with increasing redshift when the universe was increasingly neutral @xcite .",
    "fourth , we show that spatially - extended objects with @xmath78  exist at @xmath79 .",
    "finally , we find at least two [ ] emitters within 1000  of the @xmath10 solution for  in the 3d - hst coverage of the full goods - south field , the nearest separated by 69@xmath66 ( 570 kpc ) ; the fact that other galaxies exist at this exact redshift increases the probability that the line is real and is .",
    "if the physical properties of  are similar to either the [ ] blob egs - xew-1 or to the high equivalent width starbursting dwarf galaxies studied by @xcite ,  at @xmath54 would represent a new class of object 750 times fainter than the former or @xmath3330 times fainter than the latter . scaling from the typical stellar masses of the @xcite galaxies ,",
    "would have a stellar mass of order @xmath80 , similar to the mass of a single massive star cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the extended @xmath2 morphology would then indicate the distribution of ionized gas surrounding the cluster .",
    "the most urgent question is whether the line is real and associated with  as opposed to coming from a nearby contaminating object spectrum or simply being a clump of positive noise fluctuations .",
