    "the notion of parity - time ( @xmath1 ) symmetry has recently been receiving increasing attention over a wide variety of settings ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the original proposal involved a non - hermitian variant of quantum mechanics which might still produce real eigenvalues ( and hence be associated with measurable quantities ) . however , it was instead the analogy of this model with the paraxial approximation in optics which led to the proposal that such mathematical constructs can be realized in optical settings  @xcite , and which eventually led to their experimental realization  @xcite .",
    "this series of developments , in turn , prompted researchers towards a more detailed understanding of the stationary states of such @xmath1-systems ( and how they differ from their hamiltonian analogues ) , an effort to appreciate their stability properties and finally an attempt to quantify their nonlinear dynamics .",
    "this effort emerged both at the level of few - site configurations  @xcite ( which were chiefly experimentally accessible ) , as well as at that of infinite - size lattices  @xcite .",
    "although the quantum - mechanical and paraxial - optical focal points of this activity have provided an emphasis on the study of schrdinger type settings , a number of recent studies , especially on the experimental side , have led to an increased interest in oscillator systems ( which one can think of as oligomers -few site settings- of the klein - gordon type ) .",
    "more specifically , a mechanical system realizing @xmath1-symmetry has been proposed in  @xcite , while a major thrust of research has focused on the context of electronic circuits ; see e.g. the original realization of  @xcite and the more recent review of this activity in  @xcite . as an aside",
    ", we note that additional intriguing realizations of @xmath1-symmetry have also emerged e.g. in the realm of whispering - gallery microcavities  @xcite .",
    "mostly , the efforts on this oscillator realm have been limited to the study of linear systems , yet recently a number of nonlinear variants have been explored both theoretically / numerically and even experimentally . as notable such examples ,",
    "we mention the split - ring resonator chain in the context of magnetic metamaterials proposed in the work of  @xcite , as well as the experimental realization of a @xmath1-symmetric dimer of van - der - pol oscillators that arose in the work of  @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "some of these studies raised a number of intriguing theoretical questions .",
    "for instance , the theoretical modeling of the linear @xmath1-symmetric analogue of the system  @xcite led to the realization that such linear oscillator pairs may be hamiltonian _ although _ one of them has gain and the other has loss  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , led the authors of  @xcite to appreciate that this feature ( the hamiltonian nature of a @xmath1-symmetric oscillator system ) can be extended to the nonlinear case , if the nonlinearity contains both self- and cross- interactions between the oscillators and if these interactions have an appropriate ratio ( the ratio utilized between cross- and self - interactions in that work was @xmath2 ) .",
    "importantly , the latter work also extended consideration of that model to the schrdinger variant thereof ( through a multiple scales expansion ) , finding that nonlinearity may , in that context , `` soften '' the @xmath1-symmetric phase transition .",
    "that is , it may enable the existence of stable periodic and quasi - periodic states at any value of the gain - loss parameter @xmath3 .",
    "our aim in the present work is to revisit this context of two coupled nonlinear oscillators , one of which bears gain and the other loss",
    ". we will consider the nonlinear case ( almost exclusively , briefly touching upon the linear case as a special limit ) .",
    "importantly , we will also explore the ratio of cross- to self - interaction of the oscillators as a free parameter .",
    "interestingly , this will enable us to identify a series of special cases , _ including _ the integrable one recently explored in  @xcite .",
    "for all values of this nonlinear parameter and as a function of the loss / gain parameter ( @xmath3 ) and of the frequency parameter @xmath4 , we will study systematically _ both _ dimer systems .",
    "that is , we will first derive and analyze the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) dimer , to obtain a simplified understanding of the existence , stability and dynamics properties .",
    "then , in a way reminiscent of our earlier work ( involving no cross interactions )  @xcite and complementing the earlier work of  @xcite who did not focus on the periodic orbit solutions of the original nonlinear oscillator dimer , we will return to the oscillator system and explore its own solutions , in terms of their existence , stability and dynamical properties . when the solutions are identified as unstable , a brief discussion",
    "will also be given of their dynamical evolution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ( ii )",
    "we provide the model equations , discuss their symmetries and potential hamiltonian structure and indicate where corresponding exact solutions for the generalized coupled nonlinear oscillators can be obtained . in sec .",
    "iii we invoke the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and provide the stability equations and analytical results as well as perform numerical analysis of both the symmetric and asymmetric solutions for the resulting generalized dnls dimer .",
    "section iv contains the corresponding analysis of the klein - gordon dimer .",
    "a discussion of the dynamics of unstable solutions is given in sec .",
    "v. our main results and conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "vi , where a number of directions for future study are also highlighted .",
    "details of the numerical analysis are relegated to appendix a.",
    "as per the above discussion , we consider the system of coupled oscillators given by :    @xmath5    this model is an extension of that in @xcite , which can be obtained by taking @xmath6 . additionally , it is an extension of the specific case of @xmath7 considered in  @xcite . in the linear limit , @xmath8 , there are two branches of solution eigenfrequencies given by : @xmath9 with @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) corresponding to symmetric ( anti - symmetric ) linear modes at @xmath12 . here",

    "<S> in the present work , we explore the case of a general @xmath0-symmetric dimer in the context of two both linearly and nonlinearly coupled cubic oscillators . to obtain an analytical handle on the system </S>",
    "<S> , we first explore the rotating wave approximation converting it into a discrete nonlinear schrdinger type dimer . in the latter context , </S>",
    "<S> the stationary solutions and their stability are identified numerically but also wherever possible analytically . </S>",
    "<S> solutions stemming from both symmetric and anti - symmetric special limits are identified . </S>",
    "<S> a number of special cases are explored regarding the ratio of coefficients of nonlinearity between oscillators over the intrinsic one of each oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the considerations are extended to the original oscillator model , where periodic orbits and their stability are obtained . when the solutions are found to be unstable their dynamics is monitored by means of direct numerical simulations . </S>"
