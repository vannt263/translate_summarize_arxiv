    "the idea of breaking the inversion symmetry by some complex magnetic order has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "it gives rise to the phenomenon of improper multiferroicity , where the ferroelectric ( fe ) polarization is induced by the magnetic order and , therefore , can be controlled by the magnetic field .",
    "alternatively , one can change the magnetic structure by applying the electric field .",
    "this makes multiferroic materials promising for the creation of the new generation of electronic devices.@xcite    one of magnetic textures , that breaks the inversion symmetry , is the spin spiral .",
    "moreover , this property is universal , in a sense that it can take place in all types of magnetic compounds , irrespectively of their symmetry , as long as the the spin - spiral order is established.@xcite probably , this is the reason why the idea of the spin - spiral alignment became so popular in the field of multiferroics : many properties of such compounds are interpreted from the viewpoint of spin - spiral order,@xcite and the search for new multiferroic materials is frequently conducted around those with the spin - spiral texture.@xcite    nevertheless , the spin - spiral alignment alone is insufficient for having a fe activity : although the spin - spiral order breaks the inversion symmetry , one can always find some appropriate uniform rotation of spins , which , after combining with the spatial inversion , will transform the spin - spiral texture to itself ( see appendix  [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "the fe polarization in such a situation will be equal to zero . in order to make it finite ( and in order to fully break the inversion symmetry ) , one should ban the possibility of uniform rotations in the system of spins .",
    "this can be done by the relativistic spin - orbit ( so ) interaction , and today it is commonly accepted in the theory of multiferroic materials that the spin - spiral alignment should be always supplemented with the so coupling.@xcite however , as long as the so coupling is involved , the spin - spiral texture becomes deformed .",
    "then , we face the question whether the fe activity is caused by the spin - spiral order itself or by the deviation from it.@xcite the answer to this question is very important for understanding the origin of multiferroicity .",
    "mnwo@xmath0 is an important material in the field of multiferroics .",
    "although the transition temperature to the multiferroic phase is low and the fe polarization is weak , the material is fundamentally important , because : ( i ) its multiferroic phase has a spin - spiral texture ( or is believed to be the spin spiral ) ; ( ii ) the relative directions of the spin - spiral propagation vector , the spin rotation axis , and the fe polarization seem to be consistent with predictions based on the spin - spiral theory.@xcite thus , mnwo@xmath0 is regarded as one of successful manifestations of the spin - spiral theory and , actually , the discovery of the fe activity in mnwo@xmath0 was guided by this theory .    more specifically , mnwo@xmath0 crystallizes in the monoclinic @xmath1 structure .",
    "it exhibits three successive antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transitions : at @xmath2@xmath3 k , @xmath4@xmath5 k , and @xmath6@xmath7 k. the af1 phase , realized below @xmath6 , is nearly collinear and the directions of spins alternate along the monoclinic @xmath8 axis as @xmath9 ( the reason why the af1 phase is also called as the ` @xmath9 phase ' ) .",
    "the af2 phase ( @xmath6@xmath10@xmath11@xmath4 ) is incommensurate and is typically ascribed to the spin spiral with the propagation vector @xmath12@xmath13 ( measured in units of reciprocal lattice translations ) .",
    "the spin moments lie in the plane formed by the easy magnetization direction in the plane @xmath14 and the @xmath15 axis . the af3 phase ( @xmath4@xmath11@xmath16@xmath11@xmath2 ) is characterized by a collinear sinusoidally modulated afm order with the same @xmath17 .",
    "the af2 phase is ferroelectric .",
    "the polarization vector is parallel to the monoclinic @xmath15 axis : @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is relatively small : it takes a maximal value ( @xmath20 50 @xmath21c / m@xmath22 ) at around @xmath6 , and then monotonously decreases and vanishes at around @xmath4.@xcite other phases display no sign of fe activity .    in this work",
    ", we will argue that the multiferroicity in mnwo@xmath0 has a more complex origin .",
    "namely , we will show that : ( i ) it is not sufficient to have a simple spin - spiral texture ; ( ii ) the spin spiral should be deformed by some conflicting interactions , existing in the system . in mnwo@xmath0 ,",
    "these are dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions and isotropic exchange interactions .",
    "the conflict of these two interactions breaks the inversion symmetry and gives rise to the fe activity in the af2 phase .",
    "we follow the same strategy as in our previous publications , devoted to multiferroic manganites.@xcite our basic idea is to construct a realistic low - energy ( hubbard - type ) model for the mn @xmath23 bands , which would be sufficient for describing basic magnetic properties of mnwo@xmath0 at a semi - quantitative level .",
    "the model is constructed in the basis of wannier orbitals , starting from the electronic structure calculations in the local density approximation ( lda ) with and without the relativistic so interaction .",
    "the details can be found in the review article ( ref .  ) .",
    "all calculations have been performed using experimental parameters of the crystal structure.@xcite since heavy w atoms is an important source of relativistic effects , the so coupling was included already at the level of ordinary lda calculations , and thus obtained electronic structure was used as the starting point for the construction of the low - energy model .",
    "thus , although the w sites were not explicitly included to the model , the relativistic effects , associated with these sites , were allowed to contribute to the dispersion of the mn @xmath23 bands and , in this way , were taken into consideration during the analysis of the low - energy model .",
    "all obtained parameters of the model hamiltonian are collected in ref .  .",
    "after the construction , the model was solved in the mean - field hartee - fock ( hf ) approximation .",
    "we would also like to briefly comment on merits and demerits of our technique in comparison with the first - principles approach :    \\(i ) it is certainly true that the construction of the model hamiltonian is based on some additional approximations,@xcite and is sometimes regarded as a step back in comparison with first - principles calculations . on the other hand , it would not be right to think that the first - principles calculations for the transition - metal oxides are free of any approximations . the necessity to treat the problem of on - site",
    "coulomb correlations , which is frequently formulated in terms of the lda@xmath24@xmath25 approach ( with some phenomenological correction `` @xmath24@xmath25 '' , borrowed from the hubbard model ) make it similar to the model approach : it also relies on additional approximations , although of a different type .",
    "the typical approximations are the choice of the parameter @xmath25 and the form of the double - counting term , which are both ill - defined in lda@xmath24@xmath25.@xcite thus , at the present stage , it would not be right to say that one techniques is more superior than other : rather , they provide a complementary information for the analysis of material properties of the transition - metal oxides .",
    "as we will see below , results of our model analysis are well consistent with available first - principles calculations for mnwo@xmath0.@xcite    \\(ii ) the search of the ground state for noncollinear magnetic textures can be very time consuming , even at the level of mean - field hf approximation : the rotations of magnetic moments towards new equilibrium positions after including the so interactions can be very slow and require tens of thousands of iterations , as in the case of mnwo@xmath0 .",
    "in such a situation , the model hamiltonian approach is very useful , because it allows us to find a fully self - consistent magnetic structure , which is not always accessible for the ordinary first - principles calculations.@xcite    \\(iii ) the model hamiltonian approach can be very useful for the analysis and interpretation of results of complex electronic structure calculations and the experimental data .",
    "particularly , in this work it will help us to elucidate the microscopic origin of the magnetic inversion symmetry breaking in mnwo@xmath0 .",
    "we will also show that the experimental behavior of long - range magnetic interactions in mnwo@xmath0 ( ref .  )",
    "can be naturally understood in the framework of the superexchange ( se ) theory and reflects similar behavior of the transfer integrals , derived for the low - energy model .",
    "first , we solve the low - energy model in the hf approximation , by assuming the collinear ferromagnetic ( fm ) alignment of spins , and drive parameters of isotropic exchange interactions . for these purposes we employ the theory of infinitesimal spin rotations.@xcite the procedure corresponds to the local mapping of the change of the one - electron energy onto the spin hamiltonian of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the _ direction _ of spin at the site @xmath28 and the summation run over _ inequivalent pairs _ of sites .",

    "thus , all se interactions are expected to be antiferromagnetic .",
    "then , by taking @xmath31 ev and using the values of @xmath32 obtained for the low - energy model ( ref .  ) , one can find that the se theory excellently reproduces the results of the more general theory of infinitesimal spin rotations .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath31 ev is well consistent with typical estimates in the framework of the hubbard model , where @xmath48@xmath24@xmath49 and the parameters of averaged on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath25 and the exchange interaction @xmath50 , derived for the low - energy model , are @xmath51 and @xmath52 ev , respectively.@xcite thus , all estimates are consistent with each other .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that : ( i ) the physically relevant mechanism , responsible for isotropic exchange interactions in mnwo@xmath0 , is the superexchange ; and ( ii ) the distance - dependence of @xmath53 reflects the behavior of the transfer integrals @xmath32 .",
    "our calculations capture main details of the experimental distance - dependence of @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.j]).@xcite this is a very important finding , which means that in our model we should be able to reproduce the correct magnetic structures of mnwo@xmath0 .",
    "the negative aspect is that our parameters @xmath53 are ` too antiferromagnetic ' ( afm ) .",
    "for example , using the values of @xmath53 reported in fig .",
    "[ fig.j ] , the curie - weiss temperature can be estimated as @xmath54 .",
    "it yields @xmath55@xmath56@xmath57 k , which exceeds the experimental value @xmath43@xmath58 k ( ref .  ) by factor three .",
    "the discrepancy can not be resolved simply by changing the value of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath25 , which is frequently regarded as an ill - defined parameter .",
    "particularly , in order to explain the existence of fm interactions , which were observed experimentally in some of the bonds,@xcite we need an additional mechanism on the top of our model .",
    "such a mechanism can be related to the magnetic polarization of the oxygen band , similar to orthorhombic manganites.@xcite the first - principles gga@xmath24@xmath25 calculations ( where gga stands for the generalized gradient approximation  an extension of lda ) also substantially overestimate @xmath59 and @xmath60.@xcite although these calculations take into account the effect of the oxygen band , the disagreement is probably caused by additional approximations for the double - counting energy , which is ill - defined in gga@xmath24@xmath25.@xcite finally , the experimental parameters @xmath53 themselves may be sensitive to the details of fitting of the spin - wave dispersion . in this respect , we would like to mention that earlier experimental data were interpreted in terms of rather different set of parameters @xmath53.@xcite thus , at the present stage , taking into account the complexity of the problem of interatomic magnetic interactions in mnwo@xmath0 , the agreement with the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig.j ] can be regarded as satisfactory .",
    "then , we search for the magnetic ground state of mnwo@xmath0 without relativistic so coupling . for these purposes we employ the spin - spiral formalism , which is based on the generalized bloch theorem.@xcite the idea is to combine the lattice translations with rotations in the spin subspace .",
    "it allows us to treat the incommensurate magnetic textures with an arbitrary vector @xmath61 in the reciprocal space such as if the magnetic primitive cell was of the same size as the crystallographic one.@xcite the results of these calculations , which were also performed in the hf approximation for the low - energy model , are summarized in fig .",

    "nevertheless , the total energy of the spin spiral continues to decrease with the increase of @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the ` nonrelativistic ' ground state of mnwo@xmath0 is expected to be the spin spiral with @xmath69@xmath70 , which is lower in energy than the @xmath9 state by about @xmath71 mev / mn . moreover ,",
    "none of these states is ferroelectric : although the spin spiral breaks the inversion operation , the latter can be always combined with an appropriate spin rotation , which will transform the inverted spin spiral to the original one .",
    "thus , the fe polarization will vanish ( see appendix  [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "therefore , we should find the answer to the following questions : ( i ) which interaction stabilizes the af1 structure and make it the ground state of mnwo@xmath0 at low @xmath16 ?",
    "( ii ) what is the mechanism of the inversion - symmetry breaking in the af2 state , which yields finite @xmath19 ? for these purposes",
    "we consider the relativistic so interaction .",
    "it gives rise to such important ingredients as the single - ion anisotropy and dm interactions .",
    "the effect of single - ion anisotropy on the magnetic texture of mnwo@xmath0 can be studied by enforcing the atomic limit and setting all transfer integrals equal to zero.@xcite generally , the single - ion anisotropy is expected to be small for the nearly spherical @xmath33 configuration of mn@xmath34 .",
    "since the symmetry operation @xmath72 of the @xmath1 space group transforms each mn site to itself ( here , @xmath73 stands for the @xmath74 rotation around the @xmath15 axis and @xmath75 is the additional translation ) , the single - ion anisotropy will tend to align the spins either parallel to the @xmath15 axis ( @xmath76 ) or in the @xmath14 plane ( @xmath77 ) . in the latter case",
    ", the spins are canted off the @xmath78 axis by about @xmath79 , which is close to the experimental value of @xmath80.@xcite the easy magnetization direction corresponds to the in - plane configuration .",
    "however , the energy difference between hard ( @xmath76 ) and easy ( @xmath77 ) magnetization directions is small ( less that @xmath81 mev / mn ) , so that in the spin - spiral texture it can be overcome by the energy gain caused by the isotropic exchange interactions .",
    "the @xmath1 structure of mnwo@xmath0 has two mn - sublattices ( denoted as ` @xmath29 ' and ` @xmath30 ' in fig .",
    "[ fig.j ] ) , which are transformed to each other by the inversion operation .",
    "therefore , the dm interactions will obey the following symmetry rules:@xcite    * all interactions between different sublattices are equal to zero ; * the dm interactions in the sublattices ` @xmath29 ' and ` @xmath30 ' are related by the identity @xmath82@xmath83 , for any translation @xmath84 , connecting the sites within one mn sublattice ( note that @xmath85 is the axial vector ) .",
    "from now on , it is more convenient to use the extended notations and recall that each site of the lattice @xmath28 is specified by its position @xmath86 in the primitive cell and the translation @xmath84 .    moreover , due to the symmetry operation @xmath72 , all dm vectors lie in the @xmath14 plane , i.e. , similar to the easy magnetization direction , obtained from the analysis of the single - ion anisotropy .",
    "the parameters of dm interactions can be evaluated by considering the mixed type of the perturbation theory expansion with respect to the so coupling and infinitesimal rotations of spins near the fm state with subsequent mapping of obtained results for the change of the one - electron energy onto the spin hamiltonian of the form @xmath87 $ ] , constructed for each magnetic sublattice.@xcite it yields the following parameters of dm interactions ( in mev ) : @xmath88@xmath89 , @xmath90@xmath91 , and @xmath92@xmath93 .",

    "moreover , since both @xmath99 and @xmath101 lie in the @xmath14 plane , the force @xmath96 is parallel to the @xmath15 axis . finally , due to the alternation of @xmath101 in the @xmath9 texture",

    ", the isotropic exchange interactions , single - ion anisotropy , and dm interactions in the af1 phase do not conflict with each other in a sense that all of them , even jointly , continue to respect the crystallographic @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "therefore , the inversion symmetry is preserved and the polarization is equal to zero , even after including the so interaction .    the effect of so interaction on the spins - spiral alignment can be best understood for @xmath67@xmath104 ( see fig .",

    "thus , there is a conflict between isotropic exchange interactions and the single - ion anisotropy .",
    "however , since the latter is small , this magnetic structure can be realized at a low energy cost .",
    "then , due to the dm interactions , each site with @xmath106 will experience a force from its neighboring sites with @xmath105 . since @xmath107",
    ", this force will be parallel to the @xmath15 axis .",
    "alternatively , each site with @xmath105 will experience the rotational force from its neighboring sites with @xmath106 . since @xmath107",
    ", this force will also lie in the @xmath14 plane .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath108@xmath83 , the forces in different sublattices will act _ in the opposite directions_. this means that , if some dm vector @xmath109 in the first sublattice will tend to support the right - handed spiral , its counterpart in the second sublattice ( @xmath83 ) will support the left - handed spiral .",
    "however , the spin - spiral texture , that is formed by the isotropic exchange interactions @xmath53 , is always either right- or left - handed _ in both magnetic sublattices_. therefore , we have a conflict between isotropic and dm interactions : if in one magnetic sublattice , the effect of these two interactions is added , in other magnetic sublattice , it will be subtracted .",
    "all these tendencies are clearly seen in fine details of the magnetic structure , obtained in the hf calculations with so coupling ( fig .",
    "[ fig.spiral4 ] ) .",
    "first , the canting of spins , lying in the @xmath14 plane , appears to be different for the sublattices @xmath29 and @xmath30 : @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively , relative to the @xmath78 axis .",
    "second , as discussed above , the spins with @xmath106 will experience the force @xmath96 , which is also parallel to @xmath15 .",
    "however , since @xmath108@xmath83 , the vectors @xmath112 and @xmath96 at the same site will be either parallel or antiparallel , depending on the magnetic sublattice .",
    "thus , the magnitude of spin magnetic moment with @xmath106 will also depend on the magnetic sublattice .",
    "of course , this change of the magnetic moments is small ( about @xmath113 % , according to our hf calculations ) .",
    "nevertheless , it does take place and is just another manifestation of the conflict between isotropic and dm interactions .",
    "thus , the conflict between isotropic and dm interactions in the af2 phase makes the sublattices @xmath29 and @xmath30 inequivalent . since in the @xmath1 structure",
    ", these two sublattices were connected by the inversion operation , their inequivalency means that the inversion symmetry is broken and the actual symmetry of the af2 phase is lower than @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the homogeneous spin - spiral alignment itself is deformed by the dm interactions and , strictly speaking , the af2 phase is _ no longer the spin spiral_. the magnitude of this deformation can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.spiral4 ] .",
    "then , we discuss relative stability of different magnetic phases with the so interaction . in this case , the generalized bloch theorem is not applicable and there only possibility is to work with the supercell geometry.@xcite therefore , we were able to consider only solutions with @xmath114 and the rational @xmath63@xmath115 @xmath43@xmath116 , @xmath43@xmath117 , and @xmath43@xmath118 .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows . amongst af2 states ,",
    "the one with @xmath63@xmath115 @xmath43@xmath118 has the lowest energy .",
    "the state with @xmath63@xmath115 @xmath43@xmath117 is higher in energy by about 0.2 mev / mn .",
    "this behavior is similar to calculations without so coupling ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.eq ] ) .",
    "then , the af2 state with @xmath63@xmath115 @xmath43@xmath118 appears to be nearly degenerate with the af1 state ( the energy difference is about @xmath119 mev / mn , but the af2 state is still low in energy ) .",
    "although these numerical values are probably on the verge of accuracy of our model analysis , this tendency clearly shows that the so interaction additionally stabilizes af1 state relative to the af2 one .",
    "this seems to be reasonable : the conflict of dm and isotropic exchange interactions , acting in the opposite directions in one of the mn sublattices , will penalize the energy of the af2 state . on the other hand , in the af1 state",
    ", there is no such conflict and the dm interactions will additionally minimize the energy of the @xmath9 structure , obtained without so interaction . apparently , the main reason why the energy of the af2 phase is still slightly lower than that of the af1 phase is related to the fact that the isotropic exchange interactions are overestimated in our approach ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.j ] ) and , therefore , the effect of the so coupling and dm interactions on the magnetic structure is underestimated .",
    "finally , we evaluate the value of the fe polarization in the af2 phase , using the berry phase formalism,@xcite which was adopted for the low - energy model.@xcite the vector of polarization is parallel to the @xmath8 axis , in agreement with the experiment.@xcite then , the value of @xmath19 can be estimated as @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 @xmath21c / m@xmath22 for @xmath63@xmath115 @xmath43@xmath116 , @xmath43@xmath117 , and @xmath43@xmath118 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath19 is small , but it is well consistent with the fact that the dm interactions are also small and can be regarded as a small perturbation to the homogeneous spin - spiral texture , formed by isotropic exchange interactions .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to emphasize that the dm interactions are essential for deforming the spin spiral , breaking the inversion symmetry , and producing the finite value of @xmath19 .",
    "the experimental polarization is an order of magnitude larger : @xmath123c / m@xmath22.@xcite however , it can be still regarded as a ` small value ' in comparison with many other multiferroic systems.@xcite therefore , it is quite consistent with our main idea that @xmath19 is a result of small perturbation of the magnetic structure , caused by the relativistic effects .",
    "there may be several reason why the experimental value of @xmath19 is larger than the theoretical one :    \\(i ) the experimental @xmath19 may also include some lattice effects , in response to lowering of the magnetic symmetry;@xcite    \\(ii ) a unusual aspect of mnwo@xmath0 is that the inversion symmetry is broken in the `` high - temperature '' phase , while the low - temperature phase remains centrosymmetric ( for comparison , the situation in perovskite manganites is exactly the opposite).@xcite thus , in addition to the fe polarization , one should find some mechanism , which would stabilize the phase af2 over the phase af1 at finite @xmath16 .",
    "this mechanism may involve some temperature effects .",
    "\\(iii ) the low - energy model is designed for the semi - quantitative analysis .",
    "it is not always possible to expect a good quantitative agreement with the experimental data , because some ingredients can be missing in the model . in principle , the gga@xmath24@xmath25 calculations are also of a semi - quantitative level , because the value of @xmath19 depends on the adjustable parameter @xmath25.@xcite in our model analysis , the small value of @xmath19 may be again related to the overestimation of isotropic exchange interactions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.j ] ) .",
    "then , the deformation of the spin - spiral texture , caused by the relativistic effects , is underestimated .",
    "therefore , @xmath19 is also underestimated . from this point of view ,",
    "the behavior of isotropic exchange interactions , the total energies , and the fe polarization is consistent with each other , and the main efforts towards quantitative description of the fe polarization and the phase diagram of mnwo@xmath0 should be concentrated on the correct description of isotropic exchange interactions .",
    "in summary , we have provided the microscopic explanation for the origin of fe activity in mnwo@xmath0 .",
    "the multiferroicity in this compound is caused by the conflict of dm and isotropic exchange interactions in the af2 state .",
    "thus , mnwo@xmath0 is multiferroic not simply because of the spiral structure .",

    "the inversion center is marked by cross .",
    "the directions of magnetic moments in the original spin spiral ( @xmath112 ) are shown by the dark ( blue ) vectors , and those in the inverted spin spiral ( @xmath124 ) are shown by the light ( cyan ) vectors .",
    "the inverted spin structure can be transformed to the original one by @xmath125 rotation of spins around the axis @xmath126@xmath24@xmath127 , which has the same direction at all sites of the lattice .",
    ", width=566 ]    the basic property of the spin spiral is such that : if @xmath112 is the direction of spin at certain magnetic site and @xmath124 is the direction of spin at the same site after the inversion of the lattice , one can always define the axis @xmath126@xmath24@xmath127 , which will have the same direction at all magnetic sites .",
    "then , the inverted spin structure can be transformed to the original one by the uniform @xmath125 rotation of spins around this axis .",
    "now , we will provide a more general prove of this statement . to be specific ,",
    "consider the situation , realized in mnwo@xmath0 and assume that there are two sites in the primitive cell , which are located as @xmath86 and @xmath43@xmath86 , respectively .",
    "thus , these two cites can be transformed to each other by the inversion operation @xmath128 and the inversion center is located in the origin .",
    "then , the translations @xmath84 will specify the location of all other inversion centers , while the atomic position will be given by the vectors @xmath84@xmath129@xmath86 .    in the spin - spiral texture ,",
    "the directions of magnetic moments are given by @xmath130 for our purposes , it is sufficient to consider the situation where all spins rotate in the @xmath94 plane . the generalization for an arbitrary orientation of the rotation plane is straightforward and will be discussed at the end of this appendix .    consider the inversion around an arbitrary center @xmath131 .",
    "it transforms an arbitrarily taken site @xmath84@xmath129@xmath86 to @xmath131@xmath43@xmath132@xmath129@xmath86@xmath43@xmath133@xmath43@xmath84@xmath134@xmath86 .",
    "then , the direction of spin at the site @xmath135@xmath43@xmath84@xmath134@xmath86 will change from @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "thus , our goal is to find a transformation @xmath138 , which would rotate @xmath137 back to @xmath136 .",
    "this transformation is the @xmath125 rotation around the axis @xmath139@xmath24@xmath140 .",
    "the corresponding transformation matrix is given by @xmath141 since @xmath138 does not depend on @xmath84 , it corresponds to the uniform rotation of all spins . without so coupling ,",
    "this is a transformation to the equivalent magnetic state .",
    "thus , although @xmath128 is formally broken , @xmath142 is the symmetry operation , which transforms the spin spiral to itself .",
    "since the uniform rotation of spins @xmath84 does not affect the polarization , the existence of the symmetry operation @xmath142 means that the ferroelectric activity in the homogeneous spins - spiral state is forbidden .",
    "this is a general property of the spin spiral : although we have considered a specific lattice geometry , which is more relevant to mnwo@xmath0 , absolutely the same argument can be repeated , for example , for orthorhombic manganites , where the magnetic sites are located in the centers of inversion .    for an arbitrary orientation of the spin rotation plane , @xmath137 in eq .",

    "after that all arguments can be repeated again .",
