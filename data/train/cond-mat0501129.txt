    "the number of edges per vertex , which is denoted by @xmath0 , follows the power - law distribution : @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this implies the existence of a considerable number of hubs , or vertices with huge degrees , beyond what is expected of a stereotypical bell - shaped @xmath3 such as the gaussian distribution .",
    "hubs play central roles in , for example , robustness against random and intentional attacks against vertices or edges , propagating innovations , disease spreading , and synchronizing dynamical agents placed on vertices @xcite .",
    "naturally , real data analysis has focused on finding and characterizing hubs , including the evaluation of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , vertices other than hubs are also important on other occasions . as an example , let us imagine a one - shot transmission of innovation or rumor starting from an arbitrarily chosen vertex .",
    "diffusion studies establish that very first adopters are regarded too radical or immature to directly communicate the new information to a majority . instead",
    ", so - called early adopters or opinion leaders , presumably with high social statuses , credibility , or high connectivity as represented by hubs , receive the new information from the first adopters and boost its propagation @xcite . apart from the obvious role of hubs , however , properties of the first adopters determine the dominant timescale and even the success probability of diffusion , which are important in applications such as marketing and epidemics . in infinite particle systems used in physics and mathematics , such as the percolation and the contact process , the role of hubs ( resp .",
    "early adopters ) are manifested when there are initially many ( resp .",
    "few ) vertices .    if connectivity is flexible , agents can even be motivated to avoid becoming hubs and take advantage of other hubs .",
    "for example , computer viruses on scale - free networks proliferate by spreading through hubs since they are more accessible from others @xcite .",
    "then , it is better for the system cracker to hide behind hubs and exploit them , than to expose themselves to a major part of networks as hubs , which raises a risk to be detected by the authority or other vertices .",
    "similarly , intention of manipulating hubs may be present in economical behavior , politics , and marketing .",
    "the tradeoff between a cost of directly spanning edges and a benefit of having direct and indirect access to others can be formalized by a utility function such as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of vertices at distance @xmath7 from a reference vertex , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a discount factor @xcite , and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the cost of maintaining edges or being exposed to others . equation  ( [ eq : utility ] ) is also related to the growing scale - free network model , in which new vertices with a typically small constant @xmath0 are consecutively added to a network . based on the assumption of the preferential attachment , newcomers attempt to get linked to hubs @xcite . if edges are dynamically created and removed according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : utility ] ) or similar utility functions , networks typically end up with wheels , stars , or complete networks @xcite .",
    "these mathematical results imply realistic network structures as a result of evolution ; for example , stars indicate hubs",
    ". however , real networks seem to deviate from wheels , stars and complete graphs that the utility model , which usually accompanies strong constraints , predicts .",
    "we call a vertex with a large utility value an elite or a mastermind .    in this paper",

    "let us introduce the intrinsic weight of the @xmath12th vertex denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "it quantifies the potential to win edges , such as physical ability , fame , and social status @xcite . depending on situations , the direction of influence from vertices with larger weights to ones with smaller weights",
    "can be deduced independently of the predefined edge direction @xcite .",
    "for instance , whether a computer virus at a host can invade another depends on the relative security level of hosts , or vertices .",
    "networks with weight - driven edge direction also underly human relationships .",
    "another key element is homophily , which means that similar agents , particularly humans , tend to flock together .",
    "many real data from individual questionnaires @xcite , diffusion studies @xcite , and analysis of online communities @xcite support homophily according to nominal ( e.g. race , hobbies , sex , religious preference , personal traits ) and graduated ( e.g. physical distance , age , education , social status ) parameters .",
    "homophily in terms of vertex degrees , or rates of social contacts , underlies the fact that the degrees of adjacent vertices are positively correlated in social networks @xcite .",
    "various models of real networks and social interactions incorporate homophily .",
    "for example , granovetter ( 1973 ) proposed that one is mainly connected to similar others , and some weak ties also exist to bridge heterophilous individuals .",
    "then , the small - world property results because weak ties shorten the network diameter and abundant homophilous connectivity enhances clustering @xcite .",
    "hierarchical networks in which vertices with closer hierarchical levels are more likely to be adjacent are used to address search and congestion problems on networks @xcite .",
    "we note that hierarchy is also reminiscent of weight - driven edge direction mentioned before .",
    "other examples include the cultural exchange models with general homophily @xcite and the gravity models with spatial homophily @xcite .",
    "we focus on homophily based on graduated parameters because vertices are equipped with graduated intrinsic weights .",

    "[ fig : exp_th](d ) ) , which contradicts real data @xcite .",
    "in contrast , although homophily prohibits huge hubs , @xmath3 of a network with both homophily and thresholding is scale - free ( crosses ) , as is @xmath3 of the the threshold graph without homophily ( squares ) .",
    "this is because elites are scarce even if they exist .",
    "second , too strong homophily mars communication between vertices with distant weights . with the density of edges given ,",
    "the diameter becomes too large in a strongly homophilous network due to the scarceness of shortcuts bridging heterophilous vertices @xcite .",
    "the thresholding effect counteracts the homophily effect to render a network small - world . in sum",
    ", the vip - club phenomenon requires both homophily and thresholding in our framework .",
    "since the analysis developed so far is for deterministic dense networks , let us numerically examine sparse networks with stochasticity .",
    "an edge is assumed to form between vertices with weights @xmath17 and @xmath18 with probability proportional to @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the inverse temperatures .",
    "we set @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and the mean degree 10 .",
    "figures  [ fig : exp](a ) and [ fig : exp](b ) show @xmath35 and @xmath3 , respectively , for @xmath77 @xmath78 ( both homophily and thresholding , plotted by crosses ) , @xmath79 ( thresholding only , squares ) , and @xmath80 ( homophily only , circles ) .",
    "these results are roughly consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_th ] .",
    "let us next examine a scale - free network in which @xmath81 is assigned to the @xmath12th vertex @xcite .",
    "then , a pair of vertices is picked according to the distribution @xmath82 , and an edge is created if they are not yet adjacent .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the mean degree 10 is reached . as a result , we obtain @xmath1 with @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "a type of thresholding is embedded in this algorithm .",
    "we implement homophily by supposing that an edge forms with probability @xmath84 after two vertices with weights @xmath17 and @xmath18 are selected .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : goh ] for @xmath74 and @xmath85 with homophily present ( @xmath86 , crosses ) and absent ( @xmath87 , squares ) are consistent with figs .",
    "[ fig : exp_th ] and [ fig : exp ] .",
    "although we have presented just two examples , our framework is applicable to other networks with vertex fitness .",
    "in social networks with homophily , graduated weight variables often exist but are difficult to measure . in the professional tennis community ,",
    "players are ranked based on the scores , which serve as @xmath17 , gained by winning the singles games of official tournaments .",
    "we analyze networks of tennis players , which are indicative of the vip - club phenomenon . for each sex",
    ", the score distribution obeys a power law with an exponential cutoff , as the rank - score plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : rank - score ] indicate . the fact that the probability density decreases in the score @xmath17 means that better players are scarcer .",
    "the players constitute undirected networks by doubles partnership , and the edges are defined by two players pairing up in any of the doubles tournaments in a year",
    ". our model can not account for some aspects of the data , such as the homophily in nationality and score - independent individuality in the frequency of participation in the tournaments .",
    "nevertheless , two players should be strong in total to be successful , which provides thresholding .",
    "simultaneously , a strong player is expected to stick to a small number of partners because of the paucity of similarly strong players and the aversion to tying with weak players .",
    "this is equivalent to homophily .",
    "the women s network based on all the wta doubles tournaments in 2003 has @xmath88 excluding the isolated vertices .",
    "similarly , the principal connected component of the men s network based on the atp doubles tournaments in 2003 has @xmath89 .",
    "we do not consider mixed doubles in which a man and a woman team up . since the ranking is updated every week , players are differently aligned according to the rankings at the ends of 2002 and of 2003 . to circumvent noise in the data ,",
    "we add @xmath0 , or the number of doubles partners , of five players with consecutive ranks .",
    "the results are shown for women and men in figs .",
    "[ fig : tennis](a ) and [ fig : tennis](b ) , respectively .",
    "although noise is yet large and the degree distributions are not scale - free , players with intermediate ranks are somewhat more capable of encountering partners .",
    "the data in other years also have this tendency ( data not shown ) .",
    "players with high scores form a loose vip club .",
    "players with intermediate ranks are popular among both stronger and weaker players .    the vip - club phenomenon is also expected in other social situations .",
    "for example , when choosing a partner of the life , one may set a threshold on social statuses or incomes .",
    "since they are graduated quantities subject to homophily @xcite , maybe for people to communicate efficiently and live in comfort , those in upper - middle classes may be more promising in finding partners than those too close to the top . similarly , scientific collaboration networks may exhibit the vip - club phenomenon particularly in the fields like mathematics where coauthorship is rather strict .",
    "a group of strong researchers generally publishes their work in nice journals ( thresholding ) , and researchers with close abilities may flock together to coauthor ( homophily ) .",
    "the age also shows homophily @xcite , and the population density , or @xmath16 , naturally decreases in the age , or @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , business or social activities that accompany thresholding on ages can result in vip clubs formed by the old . more generally , hierarchical organizations of the pyramid type , such as companies and bureaucracies @xcite , are likely to have vip clubs .",
    "we have shown that the combination of homophily and thresholding on graduated vertex weights induces networks with elites .",
    "loss of homophily leads to the rich - club phenomenon @xcite , while unrealistically many hubs emerge if without thresholding .",
    "a vip club is invisible to the majority of vertices with small weights .",
    "they can even escape the eyes of network analyzers unless the weight - driven edge direction in addition to the predefined edge direction , which are more readily obtained , are actually inspected @xcite .",
    "actually , elites and the majority of vertices with small weights remain undistinguished if based on vertex properties such as @xmath0 , the closeness centrality , the reach centrality , the betweenness centrality , or the local clustering coefficient @xcite .",
    "they occupy structurally equivalent or similar locations of a network @xcite .",
    "paradoxically , complete understanding of connectivity and edge direction is not necessarily sufficient for knowing a network @xcite . to understand the nature of a network ,",
