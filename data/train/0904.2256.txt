    "the importance of the iron to manganese ratio as well as the distribution of those atoms within the fe@xmath3p structure seem rather undefined .",
    "the present manuscript is a first attempt towards answering such questions . in our study",
    "the magnetic , structural and electronic properties of the femnp@xmath0si@xmath1 alloy have been investigated , using xrd , mssbauer spectroscopy , and magnetic measurements combined with theoretical calculations .",
    "we observe a significant difference in the magnetic order depending on the applied sample treatment which is shown to be reversible .",
    "the remarkable change in the magnetic order is supposedly caused by the degree of crystallographic order of iron and manganese atoms .",

    "the synthesis was done under argon atmosphere and temperatures of approx .",

    "zero field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooled ( fc ) measurement protocols for different fields were applied .",
    "the annealed sample was remelted using an arc melting furnace and quenched .",
    "this remelt sample was characterized by magnetic measurements and room temperature mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "the mssbauer spectra were recorded in the absorption mode with constant - acceleration drive and a @xmath17corh source .",
    "finally the remelt sample was annealed again and characterized by magnetic measurements and mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "the magnetic properties of the later two samples were the same as those of the originally prepared samples before and after annealing , respectively .",
    "calculations using the local density approximation ( lda ) have been performed for three different phases of femnp .",
    "we assumed that all these phases have the hexagonal fe@xmath14p structure , with the same crystallographic parameters as observed experimentally for femnp@xmath0si@xmath1 . in this structure",
    "there are two possible completely ordered phases , one with mn atoms occupying the pyramidal ( high moment ) position and one where mn occupies the tetrahedral ( low moment ) position .",
    "these structures are labeled mn pyramidal and fe pyramidal , respectively . in the third phase",
    "the mn and fe atoms are completely randomly distributed on the two fe positions , and we will refer to this phase as disordered .",

    "in order to eliminate this fractional phase and to compensate a possible loss of phosphorus during the synthesis some phosphorus was added and the sample was annealed .",
    "after the annealing no trace of the fe@xmath18si impurity phase could be deduced from the xrd data . a composition analysis carried out using a electron probe micro - analyzer ( wds - epma ) as well as energy dispersive spectroscopy ( eds ) indicates an excess of iron to manganese with a fe / mn ratio of @xmath19 1.24 .",
    "in addition our analysis revealed a new impurity phase which amount to @xmath19 5 % of our sample consisting of fe and si .",

    "the distribution of iron atoms on the two inequivalent atomic positions 3f and 3 g was investigated . in a fe@xmath14p structure the pyramidal 3 g site is preferentially occupied by the less electro - negative atom and for small differences in the electronegativity by the atom with larger radius @xcite . for femnp the tetrahedral site is occupied by iron and the pyramidal site by manganese @xcite . in the case of femnp@xmath0si@xmath1 with the same stoichiometric number of iron and manganese atom one therefore would expect the iron atoms to be on the tetrahedral site and the manganese atoms on the pyramidal site .",
    "the spectral intensities from the mssbauer analysis are modified from the site abundancies due to the so called thickness effect . in the present case the thickness effect for the two spectra can be assumed to be very similar since the total absorbance is almost the same ( same mssbauer thickness ) and also due to that the lines emanating from site fe(i ) and fe(ii ) are not well resolved .",
    "the site abundancies of iron atoms on the pyramidal 3 g site for the quenched sample is found to 17(1)% .",
    "after annealing the iron concentration on the pyramidal site decreased to 12(1)% ( fig .",
    "[ femnpsi : moessbauer ] ) .",
    "the separation of fe and mn atoms on the two sites accords with the expected preferences . already in the quenched sample a significant deviation from random occupany is found and after annealing an added fraction of atoms has diffused to their preferred positions .",
    "any ordering of the pnictide elements on the two phosphorus sites 1b and 2c could not be investigated , in the present study , but may also take place as an effect of the annealing .",

    "the energy difference between the different phases is actually rather significant ( 5 - 10 mry / formula unit ) , and the phase with lowest energy is the one which is also observed experimentally , with mn preferentially occupying the high moment site .",
    "the mn pyramidal phase has a shallow energy minimum for a lattice constant of 5.83  < a<5.97 , whereas our experimental value is 5.97   for the hexagonal femnp@xmath0si@xmath1 .",
    "all three curves in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ femnp : eos_mom ] have a small kink at a lattice constant close to 5.8  .",
    "this kink is intimately connected to a sharp change in the calculated total magnetic moment per formula unit , as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ femnp : eos_mom ] , due to what is known as the magneto - volume effect . for the mn pyramidal phase , the magnetic moment drops from a considerable value at a lattice constant larger than 5.8  , to vanish completely for lower lattice constants . for the fe pyramidal phase",
    "the transition is not as sharp and the moment does not disappear until a lattice constant of @xmath195.75   is reached , and for the disordered phase the moment disappears at a lattice constant of @xmath195.62  . since the change in the magnetic moment is sharpest for the mn pyramidal phase , it is natural that the kink in the total energy curve is most pronounced for this phase .",
    "the disappearance of the magnetism for lower volumes is a consequence of the competition between kinetic energy of the electron states , which is always lower for a spin - degenerate system , and the exchange energy , which is lower for a spin - polarized system . with decreasing volume",
    "the band - width becomes broader , and consequently the kinetic energy becomes the dominating term in the total energy .",
    "hence , lower volumes favor the spin - degenerate state with a vanishing magnetic moment .",
    "the competition between kinetic and exchange energy depends intricately on the details of the electronic structure and since the different phases considered in fig .",
    "[ femnp : eos_mom ] have different electronic structures , the transition to a spin - degenerate , non - magnetic state is different for the different phases .    in fig .",
    "[ femnp : sitemoms ] we display the site projected magnetic moments of the fe and mn atoms , for the disordered phase ( upper panel ) and the mn pyramidal and fe pyramidal phases ( lower panel ) . for the disordered phase we observe that for large volumes all moments are ferromagnetically coupled , but for lower volumes the mn moment on the low moment site ( tetrahedral site ) couples antiferromagnetically to the other moments .",
    "the transition from ferromagnetic coupling to antiferromagnetic coupling for this atomic moment occurs at a volume very close to the experimental volume . at this volume",
    "the mn - mn distance on the tetrahedral sites is 2.65  .",
    "the distance between the tetrahedral and pyramidal site is similar .",
    "the same behavior is actually exhibited by the fe pyramidal phase , in that the mn moment on the tetrahedral site changes from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic with decreasing volume ( see the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ femnp : sitemoms ] ) .",
    "however , for the mn pyramidal phase this does not happen , all moments are ferromagnetically coupled .",
    "this phase corresponds to mn atoms occupying the pyramidal , high moment site , with mn moments approaching 3 @xmath2/atom . in the fe pyramidal phases the mn moments are always lower than 1 @xmath2/atom for a<6.1 , and it is tempting to explain the stabilization of the mn pyramidal phase to be due to the exchange energy of the larger mn moment of the pyramidal site .",

    "si@xmath1 measured on the quenched sample in an applied field of 50 oe ( black circles ) and on the annealed sample under an applied field of 500 oe ( red triangles , inset ) .",

    "160 k. below the maximum signaling the antiferromagnetic transition at 160 k , the susceptibility slightly increases due to not fully compensated antiferromagnetism .",
    "additionally , there is a significant thermal hysteresis between the zfc and fc curves ; the hysteresis first appears around 280 k , i.e well above the nel temperature , but at a temperature that coincides with the temperature for onset of thermal hysteresis on the quenched ferromagnetic sample .",
    "it is also of interest to note that this temperature marks the onset of a frequency dependent ac - susceptibility , that remains frequency dependent only down to the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature at 160 k. this indicates that clusters of ferromagnetic order starts to form around 280 k ( the same temperature range in which the quenched sample starts to form a long ranged ferromagnetic phase ) . on further cooling global antiferromagnetic interaction forces the sample in into a long ranged antiferromagnetic order below about 160",
    "k.    it is worth to be mentioned that the closely related compound femnp ( orthorhombic co@xmath14p structure ) also show an antiferromagnetic structure for 176k < t<265k with a doubling of the crystallographic c axis .",
    "below 175 k a complicated modulated helical antiferromagnetic structure is developed @xcite .",
    "femnp is a fully ordered compound with tetrahedral me(i ) site and the pyramidal me(ii ) site fully occupied by fe and mn atoms , respectively .",

    "[ femnpsi : exp - theo ] a comparison between calculated and measured magnetic moments is shown .",

    "full crystallographic order was assumed .",
    "it can be seen that the experimental results for the as - quenched sample and the annealed sample do not coincide with ferromagnetic ordering . both samples , annealed and as quenched exhibit a more complex magnetic structure such as antiferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism .",
    "in the case of fe@xmath4s a rather similar experimental result was explained by the ordering of vacancies on magnetic sublattices , see takayama et al.@xcite .",
    "the appearance of an antiferromagnetic phase in fe@xmath25p due to heat treatment as seen for femnp@xmath0si@xmath1 was not observed , see e.g. lundgren et al . @xcite .",

    "in this manuscript we report on the synthesis and structural characterization of femnp@xmath0si@xmath1 , a compound which crystallizes in the hexagonal fe@xmath14p - type structure .",
    "two types of samples ( as quenched and annealed ) were synthesized and characterized structurally ( using mssbauer spectroscopy ) and magnetically . it is found that marginal changes in the degree of crystallographic order causes a large change in the magnetic properties .",
    "annealing causes a larger degree of order compared to the rapidly quenched sample , and our analysis from the mssbauer data suggests that for the annealed sample @xmath19 12 % of the pyramidal ( high moment ) site is occupied by fe atoms and @xmath19 88 % by mn atoms .",
    "this correspond to almost full order for the measured fe / mn ratio of @xmath19 1.24 .",
    "assuming full site occupation this means that the tetrahedral site has @xmath19 88 % fe atoms and @xmath19 12 % mn atoms .",
    "for the quenched sample the corresponding numbers are @xmath19 17 % of the pyramidal site is occupied by fe atoms and @xmath19 83 % by mn atoms .",
    "these small changes , which eventually may be accompanied by a pnictide element ordering , result in drastically different magnetic behaviour .    the annealed sample , with higher degree of order is antiferromagnetic with a zero net moment .",
    "the as - quenched sample has a net moment of 1.26 @xmath2/f.u .",
    "our experimental finding that the magnetism depends very delicately upon the degree of order is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical first principles results .",
    "the theoretical calculations give rather large magnetic moments for the fe and mn atoms , both when occupied on the tetrahedral and pyramidal site .",
    "the largest being the mn moment for the pyramidal site , which reaches values as high as 2.8 @xmath2/atom .",
    "we do not have atomic resolved experimental values to compare these theoretical values with , but we can note that normally theory and experiment agree with each other for atomic projected moments of magnetic materials ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) with an error being less than 10 % . if we assume that this is also the case for the currently studied system , we must conclude that the as - quenched sample is a ferrimagnet or a non - collinear magnetic structure , possibly involving a spin - spiral state , since a ferromagnetic coupling of the calculated atomic moments would result in a net moment of @xmath26 @xmath2/f.u . , a value much larger than the measured value ( see fig . [",
    "femnpsi : exp - theo ] ) .",
    "the observed magnetic response of femnp@xmath0si@xmath1 is strongly dependent on the proportion of fe and mn atoms occupying the tetrahedral and pyramidal sites . a very small increase of the fe concentration on the pyramidal site , only a few percent , causes a major change from an antiferromagnet to a ferrimagnet with a rather large saturation moment .",
    "it is unclear if a modification of the stoichiometry would cause a similar change in the magnetic response , but it is tempting to speculate that this may be the case .",
    "we also find from our theory that an ordered phase with all mn atoms on the pyramidal site and all fe atoms on the tetrahedral site has a significantly lower energy compared to the disordered phase .",
    "the here studied material , femnpsi , has been characterized structurally and magnetically , with a range of experimental techniques and by first principles theory .",
    "as member of a family of materials which are relevant for magnetocaloric refrigeration .",
    "our study indicates that the influence of crystallographic order and disorder on the magnetocaloric properties is important and should be studied in more detail .",
    "this involves both varying the concentration of fe and mn as well as different annealing conditions .",
    "it is also desirable to undertake neutron scattering experiments to detect atom projected moments .",
