    "as is well known , real and complex numbers are very important to physics .",
    "all physical theories can be described as mathematical structures erected over the real and complex numbers .",
    "all theoretical predictions can be represented as real number solutions to equations given by the theories .",
    "also in many of the theories space time is represented as a @xmath0 tuple ( or d - tuple in string theories ) of the real numbers with an associated topology or metric structure .",
    "another basic aspect of physics is that all physical representations of integers and rational numbers consist of a finite string of physical systems in states that correspond to a @xmath1 representation of a number .",
    "examples include the binary string representation of numbers used in most computations and computers , and the numerical output of measurements as finite strings of decimal digits .",
    "the string representation is also used in languages where words are strings of symbols in some alphabet .",
    "these aspects emphasize the importance of real numbers .",
    "complex numbers are ordered pairs of real numbers with appropriate rules for addition and multiplication of the pair components .",
    "a 4 tuple of real numbers is the representational basis for space time with topologies or metric structures added as appropriate",
    ". also emphasized is the importance of finite strings of kits or qukits as @xmath1 representations of rational number approximations to real and complex numbers .",
    "these will play a basic role here .",
    "another aspect of central importance here is that there are many different reference frames in quantum theory @xcite .",
    "they play an important role in quantum security protocols where a sender and receiver choose a reference frame for transmission and receipt of quantum information @xcite .    in this paper reference frames",
    "play a much more basic role than has been used so far . in work done to date , such as",
    "that referenced above and @xcite , different reference frames are described within a fixed background space time .",
    "they are also based on a fixed set of real and complex numbers . here",
    "each reference frame is defined by or based on sets of real numbers , @xmath2 and complex numbers , @xmath3 and @xmath4 as a basis of space time .",
    "the choice of topology and additional structure on @xmath4 depends on the theory being considered in the frame .",
    "since there are many different isomorphic representations of the real numbers there are many different isomorphic frames .",
    "each frame is equivalent in that physical theories constructible by an observer in any one frame should have their equivalents in any other frame .",
    "this includes all theories that are mathematical structures over the real and complex numbers and describe the dynamics of systems in the background space time .",
    "if all these frames were not related and were independent of one another , this result would be of very limited interest .",
    "however this is not the case .",
    "the different frames are related .",
    "they form a structure that is a field of iterated quantum frames over the local and global gauge transformations of complex rational string states .",
    "the goal of this paper is to describe this structure and some of its properties .",
    "the structure is based on the quantum theory definitions of real and complex numbers as ( equivalence classes of ) cauchy operators .",
    "the definition of these operators is based on that for cauchy sequences of real or complex rational string states @xcite .",
    "these are states of finite qubit ( or qukit ) strings that are the quantum equivalent of the representation of real or complex rational numbers as finite digit strings in the binary ( or @xmath1 ) basis .",
    "the iteration of frames arises from the observation that in any frame , finite complex rational string states can be defined along with a set of cauchy operators on these states .",
    "since these cauchy operators are real and complex numbers , they form the basis of another frame with a space time basis as a @xmath5 of the real number operators .",
    "this frame can be said to come from or emanate from the original frame .",
    "since this process can be iterated one ends up with a finite , one way infinite , or two way infinite structure of iterated quantum frames .",
    "this one dimensional structure of iterated frames becomes two dimensional when one notes that there are a large number of representations of complex rational string states related by global @xcite and local gauge transformations on the qubit string states .",
    "extension of the structure to show the large number of different frames , one for each gauge transformation , coming from a frame , gives the resulting field structure of quantum frames .",
    "most of this paper is devoted to describing and understanding various aspects of this structure .",
    "the next section gives a representation of complex binary rational string states in terms of products of qubit creation operators acting on a vacuum state .",
    "basic arithmetic relations and operations are described .",
    "section [ rrcnqt ] repeats the definition in @xcite of cauchy sequences of complex binary rational string states and uses it to define operators that satisfy a corresponding cauchy condition .",
    "the real and complex number status of sets of cauchy operators is based on noting that the proofs given in @xcite can be applied here .",
    "gauge transformations , as products of unitary operators in @xmath6 are introduced in section [ gtr ] .",
    "transformations of rational string states and of the basic arithmetical relations and operations are described",
    ". transformed cauchy operators and the transformed cauchy condition that they satisfy are also described .",
    "section [ fiqf ] uses these results to describe the basic structure of frames emanating from frames and the frame fields .",
    "the relation between observers in adjacent frames is discussed .",
    "section [ snb ] completes the structure description by expanding it to include number strings to any base .",
    "it is seen that in this case each qukit operator in a gauge transformation can be represented as a product of operators in @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the @xmath9 prime number .",
    "the next section addresses the fundamental question of the connection of the structure to physics .",
    "the main problem is how to reconcile the infinity of reference frames , each with its own numbers and space time arena , to the physical existence of just one space time arena for physical systems ranging from cosmological to microscopic .",
    "in essence the problem is that all frames in the frame field are isomorphic or unitarily equivalent .",
    "but they are not the same .",
    "the solution of this problem is left to future work .",
    "however , it is noted that this requires some sort of process of merging or collapsing the frames into one frame , either by direct steps or by some limiting process so that the frames all become the same frame in the limit .",
    "possible approaches include use of quantum error correction code methods , particularly those of decoherence free subspaces @xcite .",
    "an example of how this might work is briefly summarized .",
    "it is clear that much work remains to be done .",
    "however , the frame field picture is quite satisfactory in many ways .",
    "for the two way infinite field there is no absolute concept of given or abstract real or complex numbers .",
    "as is the case with loop quantum gravity @xcite , there is no background space time associated with the frame field as a whole .",
    "these are relative concepts only in that for an observer in a frame , the real and complex numbers are abstract and the frame space time is the background .",
    "however , they are different for different frames .",
    "also the frame tree has a basic direction built in , that of frames coming from frames .",
    "this picture also provides some concrete steps towards the construction of a coherent theory of physics and mathematics together @xcite .",
    "another advantage of this approach is that it may provide a new approach to resolution of outstanding physical problems such as the integration of gravity with quantum mechanics .",
    "the new approach is based on the possibility that what an observer in a frame @xmath10 sees as quantum dynamics of qubit string systems in states that represent numbers , and the corresponding dynamics of cauchy operators , may be interpreted by an observer in a frame coming from @xmath10 as properties of his space time .",
    "this would avoid the problem of an observer having to reconcile quantum mechanical aspects of systems and gravity for the same space time background of his own frame . in this approach it is possible that quantum dynamics of some systems in one frame correspond to metric and topological properties of space time in another frame .",
    "if one regards complex numbers as ordered pairs of real numbers and space time as based on a 4 tuple of real numbers , then real numbers can be considered as the basis of the whole frame field construction .",
    "however complex numbers are basic because physical theories are mathematical structures over the complex numbers .",
    "also a space time arena is needed for any theory describing the dynamics of systems moving in space time .",
    "a theory such as loop quantum gravity @xcite , which is space time background independent , can be in any of the frames by ignoring the space time part of the frame .",
    "aspects of string theory that emphasize the emergent properties of space times and the connections to general relativity @xcite may be relevant .    here complex numbers will be built directly by working with complex rational number states of qubit strings described by two types of annihilation creation operators , one for real and one for imaginary rational number states . in this way both components of complex numbers will be built up together rather than first building real numbers and then describing complex numbers as ordered pairs of real numbers .    there does not appear to have been much study of quantum theory representations of real or complex numbers .",
    "the first mention of representations of real numbers as hermitian operators appeared in the 1980s in a study of boolean valued models of zf set theory @xcite and appears to have been studied briefly at that time @xcite .",
    "other more recent work on quantum representations of real numbers includes that in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "of special note is recent work that emphasizes the possible importance of different sets of real numbers based on takeuti s work in a category theoretic setting @xcite .",
    "there are a great many ways to represent real , imaginary , and complex binary rational string numbers in quantum theory . here a representation based on annihilation creation operators for qubits is used that is different from that in @xcite and @xcite in that both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 will be included .",
    "this coincides with the usual descriptions of quantum information as @xmath13 string states of qubit strings .",

    "this idea is already in use in a slightly different context in the theory of decoherence subspaces ( dfs ) @xcite .",
    "the goal of the dfs method of constructing quantum error correction codes is to exhibit two subspaces of states of two or more physical qubits that are invariant under different types of errors .",
    "states in one subspace are the @xmath45 logical qubit states .",
    "states in the other are the @xmath95 logical qubit states .",
    "this distinction between logical and physical qubits has not been made so far in that logical qubit states have been identified with states of physical systems as physical qubit states . in general , however , logical qubit states , correspond to projection operators @xmath417 on two subspaces of states of two or more physical qubits .",
    "any pure state of physical qubits in the @xmath418 or @xmath419 subspace corresponds respectively to a logical qubit state @xmath420 or @xmath421 .",
    "mixed states in the subspaces would be represented by density operators @xmath422    in this more general case the whole construction presented here of complex rational string states , real and complex numbers as cauchy operators , and different frames @xmath288 with associated space times @xmath300 would be expanded to describe rational string states in terms of strings of the logical qubit subspace projection operators .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that , logical qubit subspaces can be defined that are invariant under the action of global gauge @xmath204 acting on the physical qubit states .",
    "the dfs approach @xcite to quantum error avoidance in quantum computations makes use of this generalization . in this",
    "approach quantum errors correspond to gauge transformations @xmath204 , so the goal is to find subspaces of states that are invariant under at least some gauge @xmath204 .",
    "one way to achieve this for qubits is based on irreducible representations of direct products of @xmath216 as the irreducible subspaces are invariant under the action of some @xmath204 . here ,",
    "to keep things simple , the discussion is limited to binary rational string states @xmath423 .    as an example",
    ", one can show that @xcite the subspaces defined by the irreducible 4 dimensional representation of @xmath424 are invariant under the action of any global @xmath204 .",
    "the subspaces are the three dimensional subspace with isospin @xmath425 , spanned by the states @xmath426 and the @xmath427 subspace containing @xmath428 states in these subspaces are logical qubit states .",
    "the action of any global @xmath204 on states in the @xmath425 subspace can change one of the @xmath429 states into linear superpositions of all states in the subspace .",
    "but it does not connect the states in the @xmath425 subspace with that in the @xmath427 subspace .",
    "it follows that replacement of the physical qubit states in the complex rational string state by logical qubit states from the invariant subspaces , gives the result that , for all global @xmath204 , the @xmath288 frames at any stage @xmath23 all become just one frame at stage @xmath23 .",
    "the price for this frame reduction is the increased entanglement complexity of logical qubit states in a parent frame at stage @xmath430    this process can be extended in several ways .",
    "one way is to consider logical qubits whose states are superpositions of states of @xmath431 physical qubits @xcite . in this case",
    "the subspaces of interest are the @xmath432 dimensional irreducible subspaces of @xmath433 .",
    "these correspond to one @xmath434 subspace and two @xmath435 subspaces of @xmath431 physical qubit states . in @xcite",
    "the two @xmath435 subspaces are taken to be the logical qubit @xmath45 and @xmath95 subspaces .",
    "in this work the basic importance of real and complex numbers to physics is emphasized . all physical theories are mathematical structures over the real and complex numbers , and space time is based on a 4 tuple of the real numbers .",
    "these aspects have been used to define fields of iterated quantum frames that are based on underlying complex rational string states and their gauge transformations .",
    "rational string states are defined as products of ac operators acting on the vacuum string state .",
    "sequences of these states are replaced by operators @xmath153 acting on the string states corresponding to nonnegative integers .",
    "the cauchy condition for sequences of these states is used to define cauchy operators .",
    "( equivalence classes of ) these operators are real and complex numbers in the same sense as elements of @xmath188 and @xmath284 which are the basis of the fock space in which the ac operators are defined . the sets @xmath436 and @xmath437 of cauchy operators are the real and complex numbers and space time that are the basis of a stage @xmath95 frame @xmath438 .    the frame base is greatly expanded by gauge transformations on the rational string states . for each gauge @xmath204",
    "one has sets of cauchy operators @xmath254 that correspond to real @xmath295 and complex @xmath314 numbers and space time @xmath328 these form the basis for an infinite number of stage @xmath95 frames @xmath288 , one for each @xmath204 ( fig .",
    "[ rcst1 ] ) .",
    "all these frames are equivalent as they are related by unitary transformations .",
    "@xmath439 where @xmath440 is the identity .",
    "this process of frame construction can be iterated in one or two directions .",
    "this gives either one way infinite ( fig .",
    "[ rcst3 ] ) or two way infinite ( fig .",
    "[ rcst4 ] ) fields of frames coming from frames .",
    "for a one way infinite field , each frame has an infinite number of children frames , one for each @xmath204 .",
    "for a two way infinite field , each frame has , in addition , an infinite number of parents , one for each @xmath204 .",
    "the frame fields have an inherent direction built in that is represented by stage labels as integers .    some properties of the frame fields are noted .",
    "each frame includes all physical theories as mathematical structures over the real and complex numbers irrespective of their use of a space time arena to describe systems dynamics .",
    "all frames at any one stage are unitarily equivalent and any two frames at the same or different stages are isomorphic to each other .    the one way and two way infinite frame fields are different in that the base frame of a one way infinite field requires sets of real and complex numbers and a space time that is abstract and external in some absolute sense .",
    "they are not related to any frame .",
    "for the two way infinite frame field there are no external abstract real and complex numbers and no background space time .",
    "all real and complex numbers and space times are external and abstract in a relative sense only in that they are external and abstract relative to a frame .",
    "however they are internal objects as sets of cauchy operators in a parent frame .",
    "an important problem is to connect the field of frames to the one frame containing the observed physical universe .",
    "the goal of any process to achieve this is to identify as many frames as is possible with one frame .",
    "this is needed because it is not sufficient that frames in the frame field are isomorphic .",
    "they must become the same in some limit .",
    "it is noted that the method of decoherence free subspaces @xcite can be used to identify all frames in a stage that are related by global gauge transformations .",
    "it is clear that much remains to be accomplished .",
    "however one has a very rich structure at hand with many possibilities to investigate .",
    "also the structure enables a new approach to physical problems in that the dynamics of qukit systems in a frame @xmath10 is reflected in the dynamics of the cauchy operators in @xmath10 .",
    "it is possible that this would be seen in a frame @xmath288 as some type of effect on the space time of the frame .",
    "this suggests the possibility of a new way to approach the problem of combining gravity with quantum mechanics in that certain dynamics of quantum systems in @xmath10 appear in @xmath288 as the effect of gravity on physical systems .",
    "it is also possible that the approach of ashtekar and collaborators @xcite to loop quantum gravity may be useful here .",
    "other avenues to investigate include the use of different number bases by expanding gauge transformations from those based on @xmath216 to those based on elements of @xmath441 these are suitable for qukits where the base @xmath442 here @xmath8 is the @xmath9 prime number .",
    "other possible methods of frame identification include the possibility of turning the one and two infinite frame fields into cyclic frame fields by identifying two different stages .",
    "also the possibility of using the least action principle in a feynman path integral over the frame field needs to be examined .    in any case",
    "it is pleasing to note that this approach of constructing iterated frame fields corresponds to definite steps towards the much desired goal of constructing a coherent theory of physics and mathematics together @xcite .",
    "finally it should be noted that the structure of frames emanating from frames has nothing to do with the everett wheeler view of multiple universes @xcite .",
    "if these multiple universes exist , then they would exist within each frame in the field .",
