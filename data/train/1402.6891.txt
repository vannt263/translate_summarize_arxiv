    "from which the cmes are observed , we are able to determine the width and direction of motion of the cmes . the forward model is based on the graduated cylindrical shell model , assuming that the idealized flux rope resembles the body of a cme .",
    "we note that the cme density envelope , as observed in white - light data , most probably covers the flux rope and the shock - sheath region ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that the 3d reconstruction , by using a simplified geometry of the cme , can not fully cover the complex morphology of the cme . for our purposes",
    "we define the best fit of the gcs model to the observations when the gcs flux rope boundary matches the outer edge of the cme structure and avoids compressed streamer structures . for this",

    "this assumption is reasonable due to the position of the source region of the cmes close to central meridian and the large separation angle of stereo - a with earth ( @xmath187@xmath0 ) .    for a more complete picture of the interaction process",
    "we study in addition to white - light data , dynamic radio spectra with 1-minute resolution from the wind / waves experiment @xcite together with the interplanetary density model from @xcite .",
    "figure  [ event ] shows close to ar  11158 weak dimming regions ( marked with yellow arrows ) which are associated with each of the two cme events , providing us with a first imprint of the cme s size and direction of motion .",
    "the dimmings reveal that both cmes are initiated close to the solar disk center .",
    "cme1 is located more to the north of the ar and cme2 is directed more to the south , being centered at ar  11158 .",
    "the dimmings for the second cme are more significant , both by amount and extent .",

    "the obtained 3d parameters of each cme are also given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "in summary , visual inspection as well as the derived 3d model parameters clearly outline that both cmes propagate more or less in the same direction and are of similar density , have somewhat different axial orientations and shapes , and significantly different speeds .    figure  [ fig3 ] shows details of the cme - cme interaction as it occurs in the field - of - view of hi1-a . at 05:29  ut both cme fronts",

    "frontal parts of cme1 may be hidden by the increase in intensity as well as due to line - of - sight effects as cme2 encounters cme1 . the environmental conditions ( speed , magnetic field , density ) in which cme2 propagates obviously change over its latitudinal extent . for the southern part of cme2 a side - lobe forms which quickly weakens in intensity compared to northern latitudes .",
    "we note that the southern part of the cme ( pa-125 ) might have been swept radially forward by the fast solar wind coming from the coronal hole in the south ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we derive that the flux ropes of cme1 and cme2 are basically located over pa-70100@xmath0 , hence , the southern part of cme2 along pa-125@xmath0 is not influenced in its propagation by cme1 .",
    "we can also identify increased intensity , indicating compression , for the regions where the boundaries of both gcs flux ropes are assumed to interact ( marked by red arrows in figure  [ inter ] ) .",

    "the right panels of figure  [ resid ] show the residuals for the cme kinematics derived , i.e.  the difference between the distance - time measurements and the fitted values .",
    "residuals distributed randomly around zero indicate a more or less constant speed of the cme propagation .",
    "systematic residuals over certain periods indicate deviations from a constant speed , either increasing or decreasing .",

    "the front of cme1 is less bright than cme2 and its structure is intermittent and increased in intensity close to pa-70@xmath0 and pa-100@xmath0 , which matches with the location where both flux ropes are supposed to interact .    from the kinematical curves measured along",
    "different pas ( cf .",

    "this might be a consequence of the different axial orientations of the flux ropes estimated to deviate from each other by @xmath135@xmath0 and would indicate that the interacting magnetic field structures are decisive for the evolution of the interaction process .",
    "we would like to note that the strong kinematical changes measured for the frontal structures along pa-8090@xmath0 , affect both cmes at about the same time .",
    "since cme2 propagates in the wake of cme1 , changes in the speed of cme1 most likely affect the kinematics of cme2 . inspecting the behavior of the southern part of cme2 along pa-125@xmath0",
    ", we obtain that its frontal structure is highly deformed and propagates with much higher speed ( 960  km  s@xmath2 ) than the frontal structure measured along pa-70100@xmath0 ( 530@xmath450  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "these results give further evidence on the latitudinal range of influence of the flux rope of cme1 , associated with strong changes of the ambient density , speed and magnetic flux .",
    "deformation of cme fronts ( concave - outward shape , pancaking ) due to different solar wind speeds in low and high latitudinal regions is reported by e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    for the direction of central collision along pa-100@xmath0",
    ", we perform the exercise of assuming the simplified scenario of an inelastic collision between two bodies of similar mass ( cf .  table  [ table1 ] ) . to push cme1 from 400 to 700  km  s@xmath2 , as observed around @xmath19  ut , cme2 would need a speed of at least 1000  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "cme2 reached a maximum speed of @xmath11300  km  s@xmath2 within the fov of cor2 , but decelerated during the assumed time of collision already to @xmath1600  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this indicates that cme2 may influence cme1 much earlier than suggested by the white - light data .",
    "similar results are found for the cme - cme interaction from 2010 august 1 , for which a strong deceleration of the faster cme was observed a few hours before its leading edge showed in the heliospheric images the merging with the slower cme ahead @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the cmes are of finite thickness , thus to a finite `` signal '' travel time the interaction process may start well before changes are observed at the leading edge of cme1 , most likely through transfer of momentum ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a recent paper by @xcite identifies a number of problems in determining the type of collision between two cmes among others due to changes in the mass of the cmes during evolution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as ongoing perturbation hours after the collision .",
    "several enhancements of the radio type ii burst associated to cme2 are observed and may give hint that the interaction process started as early as 2011 february 15 02:40  ut ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , this first enhancement appears about 1 hour after the launch of cme2 , much too early for cme2 or the shock of cme2 ( @xmath17 1100  km  s@xmath2 ) to reach cme1 which is roughly at a distance of 20  r@xmath3 at that time .",
    "recent findings show that radio enhancements in type ii bursts are frequently related to shock - streamer interactions @xcite .",
    "as a large part of cme2 ( pa-70100@xmath0 ) propagates in the rear of cme1 , the radio enhancements could be a consequence of the interaction between the shock of cme2 and the streamer - like post - eruption current sheet formed behind cme1 .",
    "interestingly , the enhancements are found to be associated to type iii bursts which are all related to flares emitted from ar  11158 , the same ar where both cmes are launched from .",
    "type iii radio bursts subsequently observed on 2011 february 15 ( not shown ) , stemming from the same ar , stop at frequencies related to the downstream region of the extrapolated type ii burst , as if it would be a barrier for particles entering the magnetic structure ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . in a follow - up study",
    "we aim to make a more thorough analysis on the connection between the cutoff frequencies of type iii and type ii bursts as well as their relation to the process of cme - cme interaction . in conclusion ,",
    "our observational data reveal only the consequences of cme - cme interaction that may not be sufficient to fully describe the process of interaction .",
