    "theoretical studies of the reactions @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 have been performed recently @xcite .",
    "experimental effort is on - going at wasa@cosy to determine the corresponding decay widths @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to calculate @xmath2 in the tetraquark ( @xmath12 ) and quarkonium ( @xmath13 ) pictures of the light scalar mesons ( see refs . @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) and to establish a link between the already performed an the future experimental work at kloe @xcite and the on - going analysis at cosy , where complementary processes involving the @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons are studied .    in this paper the evaluation of @xmath2 is performed in two distinct ways , which we briefly describe in the following :    in way ( 1 ) we use previous results @xcite obtained by studying the processes , precisely measured by the kloe collaboration , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the analysis of @xcite was based on the assumption that the direct ( i.e. quark - loop driven ) decay mechanism of fig .",
    "1.a ( via derivative coupling of scalar - to - pseudoscalar mesons ) dominates , see the next section for details .",
    "the results for @xmath2 turn out to be large compared to other works @xcite and seemingly unlikely ( especially in the @xmath13 assignment ) .",
    "in particular , the decay @xmath18 turns out to be sizably larger than the corresponding experimental value @xcite . also , using ( sakurai s version of ) vector meson dominance ( vmd ) , the @xmath19 decays turns out to be 2 ( 3 ) orders of magnitudes larger than the experimental results , in the tetraquark ( quarkonium ) scenario .",
    "for all these reasons , the scenario in which the mechanism in fig . 1.a dominates the radiative @xmath20 decay is disfavored .",
    "however , its final rejection ( or , eventually , resurrection ) will be possible as soon as the experimental results for @xmath2 will be known .    in way ( 2 )",
    "we start from @xmath19 data of @xmath14 and @xmath15 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . using vmd , the decays @xmath2",
    "are evaluated : smaller results are obtained , in line with other studies and with the experimental value @xmath21 both in the tetraquark and the quarkonium scenarios . these results for @xmath2 , if confirmed , unequivocally show that the mechanism in fig .",
    "1.a is negligible when studying @xmath20 decays , in turn meaning that the kaon - loop approach of fig .",
    "1.b dominates .",
    "besides radiative decays , an important result of our work comes from the study of decays into two pseudoscalar mesons of the full nonet @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 , both in the tetraquark and quarkonium pictures by using the decay amplitudes measured in refs .",
    "quite remarkably , the tetraquark assignment works better than the quarkonium one : in fact , large decay widths for @xmath26 and @xmath27 are found , while in the quarkonium assignment small -and thus unphysical- values for the widths are obtained .",
    "moreover , the scalar mixing angle in the @xmath28 assignment is compatible with zero , in agreement with the degeneracy of @xmath14 and @xmath15 being @xmath29[\\overline { u},\\overline{s}]+[d , s][\\overline{d},\\overline{s}])$ ] and @xmath30[\\overline{u},\\overline{s}]-[d , s][\\overline{d},\\overline{s}])$ ] respectively .",
    "( a large value of the mixing angle would inevitably spoil the mass degeneracy , which is one of the key features in favour of a tetraquark interpretation of scalars ) .",
    "on the contrary , in the @xmath13 assignment the mixing angle turns out to have a sign which is opposite to the one expected from basic considerations of the axial anomaly .",
    "the paper is organized as it follows : after a brief recall of radiative @xmath20 decays ( section 2 ) , we turn the attention to the results in the tetraquark ( section 3 ) and quarkonium scenarios ( section 4 ) respectively .",
    "then , in section 5 further discussions and conclusions are presented .",
    "as a first step we briefly review the mechanisms of the radiative @xmath20 decays : the reaction @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath15 is followed by a subsequent decay of @xmath33 into two pseudoscalar mesons . in the case in which @xmath34 @xmath15 are tetraquark or quarkonium states ( i.e. correspond to a preformed and preexisting , non - dynamically generated states , see the discussion in ref .",

    "it is important to stress that in the considered tetraquark / quarkonium interpretation of @xmath15 and @xmath14 both mechanisms necessarily take place .",
    "it is however still unsettled which one , if any , is dominant .    on the contrary , in the molecular assignment only the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath55 do not vanish (",
