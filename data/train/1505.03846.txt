    "models based on coupled harmonic oscillators have long attracted attention in several different fields due to their wide range of applications @xcite . in particular , the case of two harmonic modes coupled through their angular momentum , which describes the motion of a charged particle within a general harmonic trap in a uniform magnetic field or , equivalently , the motion in a rotating anisotropic harmonic potential @xcite , has been employed in distinct scenarios , such as rotating nuclei @xcite , quantum dots in a magnetic field @xcite and fast rotating bose - einstein condensates @xcite within the lowest landau level approximation @xcite . since its hamiltonian is quadratic in the field operators , the model is also suitable for simulation with optical techniques @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite its dynamics in coordinate representation",

    "squeezing is important for quantum metrology , i.e. , for improving the accuracy in quantum measurements @xcite , and it has been shown that in some cases spin squeezing can be employed to detect entanglement @xcite . nonetheless , in some regimes ( like the linear case of the model considered in @xcite ) squeezing may also arise without substantial entanglement .    in this work",
    "we first derive the exact analytic expressions for the temporal evolution of the heisenberg field operators of two harmonic modes coupled through their angular momentum .",
    "the obtained result is valid for all values of the system parameters , i.e. , in stable as well as unstable dynamical regimes , and allows to determine the exact evolution of an arbitrary observable of the system .",
    "we then apply this result to determine and examine the dynamics of squeezing , which has so far not been investigated in this model , and its relation with the generated entanglement , when starting from a separable coherent initial state .",
    "we will show that different regimes can arise depending on the value of the rotational frequency .",
    "close to the instability point , appreciable entanglement is generated , accompanied with simultaneous squeezing in one of the variables of each mode , while for small couplings , the generated entanglement is weak , with small squeezing appearing in both variables of the mode at alternating times .",

    "<S> we investigate the exact dynamics of a system of two independent harmonic oscillators coupled through their angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the exact analytic solution of the equations of motion for the field operators is derived , and the conditions for dynamical stability are obtained . as application , we examine the emergence of squeezing and mode entanglement for an arbitrary separable coherent initial state . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that close to instability , the system develops considerable entanglement , which is accompanied with simultaneous squeezing in the coordinate of one oscillator and the momentum of the other oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for weak coupling away from instability , the generated entanglement is small , with weak alternating squeezing in the coordinate and momentum of each oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> approximate expressions describing these regimes are also provided . </S>"
