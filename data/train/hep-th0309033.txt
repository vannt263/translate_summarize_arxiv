    "while the standard model ( sm ) has been successful in fitting all current accelerator data , the origin of the quark and lepton mass spectrum remains a puzzle requiring further understanding .",
    "thus the explanation of the striking hierarchy of masses ( e. g. the up to top quark mass ratio is @xmath4 ) and the hierarchy of elements in the ckm matrix all are beyond the scope of the standard model .",
    "the matter has been further exacerbated by the discovery of neutrino masses , since now in addition there is need for an explanation of the mns matrix as well as the origin of the very tiny neutrino masses .",
    "a large number of suggestions exist in the literature attempting to explain these properties of quarks and leptons .",
    "one approach , starting perhaps with the work of georgi and jarlskog @xcite , suggests that the fundamental origin of quark and lepton masses is to be found at high energies , i. e. the gut scale , @xmath5 gev , and the complexity we see at low energies arises from the running of the renormalization group equations ( rges ) down to the electroweak scale .",
    "this approach , however , has not appeared to be too promising .",
    "thus a general analysis of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 yukawa matrices with five zeros at the gut scale given in @xcite is shown in . here",
    "@xmath8 is the wolfenstein parameter , and the choice of table 1 , when evaluated at the electroweak scale does indeed agree approximately with the quark masses and ckm matrix . however , to generate the experimental hierarchy one has to have entries at the gut scale of size @xmath9 , showing that the problem at the gut scale is very much the same as at the electroweak scale .    ' '' ''",
    "@xmath10    ' '' ''    string theory represents at present the only model that has been proposed which in principle can calculate the yukawa matrices from first principles .",
    "unfortunately , mathematical tools to explicitly do this have not yet been developed . in spite of this ,",
    "the general formulation of the yukawa problem in string theory opens new windows for seeing how the quark and lepton hierarchies might naturally have arisen , approaches not available in standard sugra gut theory .",
    "in particular , the horava - witten heterotic m - theory @xcite , which offers a natural explanation of why grand unification can occur at @xmath11 rather than the planck scale @xmath12 , has had significant development @xcite giving rise to three generation models with the sm low energy gauge group @xmath13 . in this model ,",
    "physical space is one of two 10 dimensional ( 10d ) orbifold planes separated by a finite distance in the 11th dimension , the theory obeying @xmath14 symmetry in the 11th dimension .",
    "six of the 10 dimensions are compactified to a calabi - yau ( c - y ) threefold , the remaining four being minkowski space .",
    "an array of six dimensional 5-branes perpendicular to the 11th dimension can exist between the two orbifold planes .",
    "while it is not possible to make first principle calculations , one can examine whether the general structure of such a theory can replicate the sm at low energy . in this connection , it was seen in @xcite that the general structure of the quark mass matrices can arise without undue fine tuning if the 5-branes lie close to the distant orbifold plane , and the instanton number of the physical orbifold plane , @xmath15 vanished .",
    "it was explicitly shown in @xcite that a three generation model with @xmath16 and sm gauge group indeed can exist for a torus fibered calabi - yau ( with two sections ) with del pezzo base @xmath0 .",
    "the quark and ckm matrix were calculated for a model of this type in agreement with data , and it was shown also in approximate analytic calculations how the mass hierarchies can arise without undue fine tuning due to the general structure of the kahler potential .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of @xcite in two directions .",
    "we first include the charged lepton mass matrix and obtain the mass hierarchies experimentally seen .",
    "we then consider neutrino masses .",
    "the conventional way for accounting for the very small mass of neutrinos is the seesaw mechanism @xcite which gives rise to majorana neutrino masses .",
    "we consider here , however , a new way of achieving small neutrino masses based on the structure of the kahler potential .",
    "this mechanism is different from the seesaw mechanism , and gives rise to dirac masses for the neutrinos .",
    "neutrino masses and the mns matrix @xcite are calculated consistent with the large mixing angle ( lma ) analysis of the solar , atmospheric , reactor and long baseline neutrino data ( e.g. see @xcite for a global analysis in the context of oscillations ) . because of the appearance of the mns matrix , lepton flavor violation processes , which are absent in the sm , will occur in this model .",
    "sm contributions here are too small to be observed experimentally . however , susy contributions are much larger .",
    "we have studied the @xmath17 decay in this model including all possible contributions . for large @xmath18 ,",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath17 is close to the current experimental bound @xcite , and would be accessible to future experiments @xcite .",
    "a summary of some of the above results was given in @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we give a brief review of m - theory , and the basic results obtained in @xcite for torus fibered calabi - yau manifolds . in sec .",
    "3 we review and update the results of @xcite for the quark masses and extend this analysis to the lepton sector . in sec .",
    "4 we introduce the new mechanism to obtain small neutrino masses and calculate the masses and mixing angles for this model . in sec .  5 we present our calculation for the @xmath17 decay . finally , conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the horava - witten m - theory is concerned with 11 dimensional supergravity on an orbifold @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is reflection of the 11th coordinate .",

    ", @xmath22 is the product space @xmath25 where @xmath26 is minkowski space and @xmath27 is a ( compact ) c - y threefold , the physical world living on one of the orbifold planes ( e.g. @xmath28 ) , the other orbifold plane being a `` hidden '' sector . in addition , there may be six dimensional 5-branes lying along @xmath29 at bulk points @xmath30 with @xmath31 , parallel to the orbifold planes , each with four dimensions spanning @xmath26 , the additional two dimensions wrapped around a holomorphic curve in the calabi - yau space .",
    "the construction of a consistent theory involves a remarkable set of interlocking constraints due to anomaly cancellation , gauge invariance , and local supersymmetry leading naturally to a theory which possesses a number of properties appropriate for phenomenology .",
    "thus there must be @xmath32 gauge interactions with chiral multiplets on each @xmath22 orbifold plane ( so(32 ) being excluded ) which can easily be broken on the physical plane to the sm group by wilson lines .",
    "the 10d gauge coupling constant , @xmath33 , is uniquely determined in terms of the 11d planck mass , @xmath34 , leading to the result that the fundamental scale of nature , the 11d planck mass , is @xmath35 , and explaining why grand unification occurs at @xmath11 rather than the 4d planck mass ( which is a derived quantity ) .",
    "finally , a consistent theory exists only as a quantum theory ( the classical theory being inconsistent ) , something one would hope might be true for any fundamental theory .",
    "much progress has been made in showing what the low energy structure of such a theory might be , and models with three generations of quarks and leptons obeying the sm gauge group have been constructed .",
    "while the details of the construction of the theory given in @xcite is rather intricate , it is possible to see how the different elements interact to produce a physically interesting model and so we first briefly summarize this construction .",
    "we then give the relevant formulae needed to examine the low energy structure .",
    "details of the latter can be found in @xcite , and for the specific model considered here in @xcite .",
    "the field content of 11d supergravity is the metric @xmath36 , the gravitino @xmath37 , the three form @xmath38 and its field strength @xmath39 .",
    "( in lowest order @xmath40 . )",

    "@xmath44 is the 11d gravitational constant .",
    "the horava - witten theory comes about as follows .",
    "while in a smooth manifold 11d supergravity has no anomalies , on an orbifold anomalies arise at the fixed points @xmath45 and @xmath46 . to cancel these",
    ", it is necessary to put yang mills multiplets on each @xmath22 orbifold plane , and the cancellation occurs only if the gauge group on each manifold is ( the phenomenologically desirable ) @xmath32 .",
    "to lowest order , the yang mills lagrangian on each @xmath22 reads then : @xmath47where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the associated gaugino . however , eq . ( [ eq202 ] )",
    "is not locally supersymmetric , and one must proceed in the usual fashion to add additional interactions and modifications of the transformation laws to achieve local supersymmetry . as usual , this involves coupling the gravitino to the yang mills supercurrent .",
    "however , unlike the case where the yang mills and supergravity multiplets live in the same space , the gravitino here lives in the 11d bulk , while the yang mills multiplet is constrained to live in 10d .",
    "for this situation , a locally supersymmetric yang mills theory can not be achieved simply by adding interactions on the orbifold plane .",
    "it turns out that a supersymmetric theory can be achieved only by modifying the bianchi identities to read @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath30 , @xmath53 are the positions of the five branes , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath53 are sources from the 5-branes . with eq.([eq203 ] ) , the total supergravity + ( modified ) yang mills lagrangian can be made locally supersymmetric .",
    "however , having gained supersymmetry , one has lost yang mills gauge invariance ( ! ) . for while eq.(3 ) implies that @xmath56 is gauge invariant , the corresponding potential @xmath57 now is not , i.e. under a yang mills gauge transformation one has @xmath58.\\ ] ] which implies the @xmath59 term of eq.([eq201 ] ) is not gauge invariant .",
    "thus the classical theory is not gauge invariant , and a consistent classical theory does not exist .",

    "eq.([eq206 ] ) leads immediately to interesting phenomenological consequences . for compactifying @xmath21 on a manifold",

    ", one finds that the fundamental 11d planck mass is @xmath65 and @xmath66 gev .",
    "alternately one may say that the 11d planck mass is the fundamental scale and it sets the gut scale , while the largeness of the 4d planck mass is due mostly to accidental @xmath67 factors arising in the analysis .",

    ", we find that @xmath228 produces acceptable neutrino masses ( we assume @xmath229 tev in our calculation ) , and from eq.([eq312a ] ) , one finds that @xmath230 . at the weak scale , after the diagonalization of charged lepton and neutrino yukawa matrices , the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) lepton mixing matrix arises .",
    "we follow the standard parameterization @xcite ( the phase similar to the one in the ckm matrix is ignored ) :    @xmath231    where @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",

    "since our model is a complete model of neutrino masses , we can calculate all the masses themselves and not just the mass square differences . for the above example",
    "we find [ eq412a ] m_1 = 6.5 10 ^ -4 ; m_2 = 7.4 10 ^ -3 ; m_3 = 5.2 10 ^ -2 consistent with cosmological constraints on neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "the analysis of solar and kamland data in terms of two neutrino oscillations gives for the lma solution @xcite :    @xmath241    where @xmath242 is the solar neutrino mass square difference and @xmath243 is the corresponding mixing angle and the ranges in eq.([eq413 ] ) ( and eq.([eq414 ] ) below ) are @xmath244 around the central value .",
    "the analysis of super - kamiokande and k2k data shows for the lma solution @xcite :    @xmath245    where @xmath246 and @xmath247 are the relevant mass square difference and mixing angle for the atmospheric neutrino oscillation .    since in our case",
    "@xmath248 , solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations decouple @xcite . therefore the two neutrino oscillation analysis can be applied to our case with the effective mixing angles given by : @xmath249 eq.([eq411])-([eq412 ] ) , ( [ eq413 ] ) and ( [ eq414 ] ) show that our results agree with the current lma solution quite well .",
    "lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) processes in supersymmetric models have been discussed in much detail in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) . in our model the mns matrix by itself can give rise to lfv processes , but this contribution is still very small , e.g. for @xmath17 , the decay rate is of @xmath250 @xcite .",

    "to evaluate the branching ratio of @xmath17 , we first generate yukawa textures in the way described in sec .  3 with phenomenological inputs including the fermion masses and neutrino oscillations described in sec .",
    "then we choose soft breaking parameters at the gut scale and run the rges to the weak scale .",
    "finally one can use the formula given above to calculate the @xmath17 branching ratio .",
    "we display our results in the following three figures for @xmath275 , 30 and 40 .    [ 0.6 ] branching ratio of @xmath255 for @xmath276,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.6 ] branching ratio of @xmath255 for @xmath277,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.60 ] branching ratio of @xmath255 for @xmath235,title=\"fig : \" ]    although our yukawa textures are constructed through the kahler potential , the usual msugra structure holds at the gut scale .",
    "in addition , to constrain the parameter space , we implement the relic density constraint @xcite : @xmath278 . for a given @xmath279 , an allowed narrow region of @xmath280",
    "is determined by the relic density constraint @xcite . since the @xmath255 branching ratio is not sensitive to the value of @xmath280",
    "we only show the result for one value of @xmath280 in the allowed region for any given @xmath279 .",
    "there are other experimental bounds on the parameter space , e.g. the @xmath281 decay , the light higgs mass , the muon @xmath282 , all of which can easily be implemented . since @xmath280 is significantly constrained by the relic density bounds for any given @xmath279 , other experimental constraints",
    "are only needed for constraining @xmath279 .",
    "for example , at @xmath184 , the @xmath283 branching ratio produces a lower bound of @xmath284 on @xmath279 while a muon @xmath282 deviation from the sm can produce an upper bound on @xmath279 . for the purpose of showing what @xmath17 branching ratio can be reached in our model , except for the relic density constraint , we ignore the other experimental bounds in our plots since they are not significant for this purpose .    in our plots",
    "the y - axis is the logarithmic ratio of our theoretical predictions to the current experimental bound @xcite .",
    "therefore , only the region below zero is experimentally allowed .",
    "one can see that at large @xmath18 , especially for @xmath235 , the theory predictions are only about one order of magnitude smaller than the experimental bound and hence accessible to future experiments @xcite while part of the parameter space for lower @xmath18 will also be accessible .",
    "in this paper we have extended a model of the quark mass hierarchy based on the m - theory @xcite to include charged leptons and massive neutrinos .",
    "the model is based on the assumptions that five branes exists in the bulk lying near the distant orbifold plane ( i. e. about 90% of the way from the physical plane ) , and that the instanton charges on the physical plane vanish .",
    "we had previously seen that this gave rise to a three generation model with the standard model gauge group at the gut scale . while one can not calculate yukawa couplings in m - theory ( they involve integrals over the calabi - yau space ) these constraints were sufficient to qualitatively account for the quark mass hierarchy at the electroweak scale without undue fine tuning .",
    "the mechanism that achieved this was that the five brane contribution to the kahler potential gave rise to small kahler matrix eigenvalues , and the quark masses were proportional to the reciprocal square root of the eigenvalues when the kinetic energy was put into canonical form .",
    "we saw that the same mechanism also gave rise qualitatively to the hierarchy of charged lepton masses , again without any excessive fine tuning .",
    "neutrino masses can arise in these models if a right handed neutrino exists in the massless particle spectrum .",
    "then one can assume that the kahler potential has a cubic holomorphic contribution of the form of eq.([eq402 ] ) , the interaction being scaled by the 11 dimensional planck mass ( the basic parameter of horava - witten theory ) .",
    "when transformed to the superpotential by a kahler transformation , this term gives rise to neutrino masses of the correct size after supersymmetry breaking .",
    "( thus the mechanism being used here for the neutrino masses is similar to the one previously used to generate a @xmath285 parameter of electroweak size @xcite . )",
    "it is possible then to chose natural sized values for the yukawa and kahler matrix entries to generate masses and ckm and mns mixing angles in agreement with all low energy data .",
    "the neutrinos in this model are dirac , and so will exclude neutrinoless double beta decay",
    ". however , the mixing in the neutrino sector allows for @xmath17 decay to occur , and with reasonable values of the susy parameters , this decay should become observable in the next round of @xmath285 catalysis experiments @xcite over a significant range of parameters .    aside from the kahler and yukawa matrices , the quark , lepton and neutrino properties depend on the calabi - yau volume modulus",
    "@xmath62 which we have parameterized by @xmath286 and the radius modulus r. we have found that all the quark , lepton and neutrino masses can be fit satisfactorily with @xmath200 and @xmath93 of @xmath114 .",
    "thus for the example in text for @xmath235 we found @xmath228 and @xmath230 .",
    "one important feature of this horava - witten model that has not been addressed here is how to stabilize the position of the 5-brane close to the distant orbifold plane .",
    "one possibility may involve quantum corrections , e.g. membrane potentials between the 5-brane and the orbifold planes @xcite .",
