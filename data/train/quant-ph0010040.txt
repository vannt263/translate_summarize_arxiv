    "however , as lov grover so astutely observed , on a quantum computer the search of an unstructured database can be accomplished in @xmath10 steps , or more precisely , with the application of @xmath11 sufficiently local unitary transformations .  although this is not exponentially faster , it is a significant speedup .",
