    "decades of experimental measurements of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross sections have resulted in precise phase - shifts and scattering parameters that provide the cornerstone of nuclear physics .",
    "these two - body interactions , when combined with multi - body interactions , dictate the low - energy spectrum and interactions of nuclei , and also the equation of state of nuclear matter at moderate densities .",
    "further , these interactions are responsible for the fine - tunings that permeate nuclear physics , and are responsible for producing sufficient carbon in the universe to allow for the emergence of life . during the last several years",
    ", there has been a substantial effort to determine the nn interactions directly from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) using the numerical technique of lattice qcd ( lqcd )  @xcite .",
    "steady progress is being made toward this objective , but calculations at the physical light - quark masses have not yet been performed , and essentially only one lattice spacing has been used in calculations . while calculations at the physical light - quark masses , that are extrapolated to the continuum limits and are performed in volumes ( and temporal directions ) that are much larger than the inverse compton wavelength of the pion , are required to verify the lqcd technology and provide a rigorous underpinning of modern nuclear interactions , calculations at heavier pion masses are equally important in understanding and quantifying the fine - tunings in nuclear physics .",
    "it is crucial to understand how the fine - tunings in nuclear physics translate into constraints on the five relevant fundamental parameters in the standard model of particle physics : the three light - quark masses , and the strong and electromagnetic coupling constants , and the nn interaction provides the simplest place to begin this investigation .",
    "one reason that there are presently few lqcd calculations of nn interactions is the significantly greater complexity of multinucleon systems as compared with systems of single mesons and baryons .",
    "a second reason is that significant computational resources are required to generate high - quality ensembles of gauge field configurations at or near the physical light - quark masses , an effort that has only become practical with the availability of petascale computers , and , as yet , these ensembles are not at sufficiently large volume to be of use in nuclear physics . at heavier quark masses , the resources required to generate ensembles of lattice gauge configurations and light - quark propagators are relatively small , the degradation of the signal - to - noise in multinucleon correlation functions is significantly reduced , and thermal effects are exponentially suppressed , compared to calculations at lighter pion masses . for these reasons , we performed lqcd calculations of a number of s - shell nuclei and hypernuclei with @xmath10 at the su(3)-flavor symmetry point with the physical strange quark mass giving @xmath11 , at a lattice spacing of @xmath12 , and in lattice volumes with spatial extents @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we continue this study and explore the nn scattering phase shifts below the inelastic threshold and the associated scattering parameters relevant below the t - channel cut at the su(3 ) symmetric point .",
    "three ensembles of isotropic gauge - field configurations , generated with a tadpole - improved lscher - weisz gauge action and a clover fermion action  @xcite , are used in this work and have been used previously to calculate the lowest - lying levels of the s - shell nuclei and hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "this particular lattice - action setup follows closely the anisotropic clover action of the ensembles generated by the jlab group that we have used in our previous calculations  @xcite .",
    "the parameter tuning and scaling properties of this action will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "one level of stout smearing  @xcite with @xmath13 and tadpole - improved tree - level clover coefficient @xmath14 are used in the gauge - field generation .",
    "studies  @xcite of the partially - conserved axial - current ( pcac ) relation in the schrdinger functional indicate that this choice is consistent with vanishing @xmath15 violations , leading to discretization effects that are essentially @xmath16 .",

    "is not constant , but rather is falling , we conclude that pion exchange is no longer the only significant contribution to the long - range component of the nuclear force , consistent with the meson spectrum found at these quark masses .",
    "while more precise calculations at these quark masses are desirable , and lqcd calculations at other light - quark masses and at other lattice spacings are required to make definitive statements , the present calculations suggest that the deuteron remains unnatural over a large range of light - quark masses .",
    "this would imply that the unnaturalness of the deuteron binding energy at the physical point is a generic feature of qcd with three light quarks and does not result from a fine - tuning of their masses .",

    "however , in contrast to the @xmath6 channel , the @xmath3-channel is clearly finely - tuned at the physical light - quark masses .",
    "the range of light - quark masses over which it is fine - tuned requires further lqcd calculations to determine , and eventual consideration of isospin violating effects due to light - quark mass differences and electromagnetism .",

    "the closeness of the values of the scattering parameters at @xmath58 is consistent with the expectations of the large - n@xmath56 limit of qcd .",
    "we have presented the results of lattice qcd calculations of low - energy nn scattering phase - shifts and scattering parameters at the su(3 ) symmetric point with a pion mass of @xmath58 .",
    "for the first time , the effective ranges of the nn interactions have been determined using lattice qcd .",
    "the calculated scattering lengths and effective ranges indicate that the pion is not the dominant contribution to the long range part of the nuclear force at these large light - quark masses , as anticipated from the single - hadron spectrum . in both spin channels ,",
    "the nn phase shifts change sign at higher momentum , near the start of the t - channel cut , indicating that the nuclear interactions have a repulsive core even for heavier quark masses .",
    "this suggests that the form of the nuclear interactions , and the effective potentials that will reproduce the scattering amplitude below the inelastic threshold , is qualitatively similar to the phenomenological potentials that describe the experimental scattering data at the physical pion mass .",
    "both spin channels are , in a sense , more natural at @xmath59 , where both satisfy @xmath60 , than at the physical pion mass where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the relatively large size of the deuteron compared with the range of the nuclear forces may persist over a large range of light - quark masses , and therefore might , in fact , not be usefully regarded as a fine - tuning in @xmath63 qcd , but rather a generic feature .",
    "the @xmath3 channel , in contrast , is finely tuned at the physical light - quark masses and it remains to be seen over what range of masses this persists .",
    "our calculations were performed at a single pion mass with one lattice spacing and in the absence of electromagnetic interactions .",
    "it should be stressed that in the presence of fine - tuning , as in the @xmath3 channel at the physical point , lattice - spacing artifacts can be enhanced with respect to expectations based on naive dimensional analysis and scaling arguments . in order to fully explore",
