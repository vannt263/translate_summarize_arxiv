    "they are distinguished from warmer l - type @xcite and m - type dwarfs in the near - infrared by the presence of these molecular features , in addition to significant h@xmath2o and collision - induced ( cia ) h@xmath2 absorption @xcite . since the discovery of the prototype of this class , gliese 229b @xcite , over 30 t dwarfs have been identified , most in the wide - field two micron all - sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter 2mass ) and sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss ) .",
    "classification schemes for these objects based on near - infrared spectral morphology have been defined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "t dwarfs identified in wide - field surveys are all likely within 25 pc of the sun , the limiting distance for the nasa / nsf nstars project .",
    "indeed , brown dwarfs in general may constitute a significant population in the solar neighborhood , roughly equal in number to the stellar population @xcite .",
    "they have generally eluded detection , however , because of their intrinsic faintness . as the solar neighborhood is the basis for many studies of stellar atmospheres , star formation and evolution , initial mass function , and galactic structure , characterizing",
    "the local substellar population is of some importance .",
    "this is especially true at closer distances , such as the 10 pc recons sample @xcite , where the stellar census is far more complete , but few l- or t - type stars and brown dwarfs are currently known .    in this article",
    ", we present the discovery of a bright t dwarf , 2mass j15031961 + 2525196ss@xmath0ddmmss[.]s '' .",

    "( hereafter 2mass 1503 + 2525 ) , identified in a new search of the all - sky 2mass working point source database ( wpsd ) .",
    "the spectrophotometric distance of this object places it within 10 pc of the sun . in @xmath72",
    "we describe our new wide - field t dwarf search and compare it to previous search efforts . in @xmath73",
    "we discuss the identification of 2mass 1503 + 2525 in our search and its subsequent confirmation as a t dwarf using the lick 3 m gemini infrared camera . in @xmath74",
    "we derive the spectral type and spectrophotometric distance of 2mass 1503 + 2525 .",
    "we discuss our results in @xmath75 .",
    "our current program is a continuation of a previous 2mass search @xcite conducted when this survey was roughly 50% complete .",
    "2mass is ideal for identifying t dwarfs , as the jhk@xmath8 filters it has employed sample the peak of the spectral energy distribution of cool brown dwarfs , enabling us to probe relatively deeply and over a large area of sky .",
    "a total of 17 t dwarfs were detected in our earlier search in three separate samples : a primary sample covering 16,620 deg@xmath9 , requiring j @xmath10 16 , j ",
    "h @xmath10 0.3 , and h ",
    "k@xmath8 @xmath10 0.3 for candidates selected from the 2mass wpsd ; and two auxiliary samples selected from 2mass incremental release data with smaller search areas but somewhat different color criteria .",
    "however , the overall stringent color cuts used in this search prevented our detecting early- and mid - type t dwarfs @xcite , while our small sample resulted in large statistical uncertainties for population statistics such as the t dwarf space density and substellar mass function ( burgasser 2001 ; burgasser et al . ; in preparation ) .",
    "our current search effort , using the 2mass wpsd , attempts to address these shortcomings in two ways .",
    "first , we have expanded our color criteria to j ",
    "h @xmath4 0.3 _ or _ h ",
    "k@xmath8 @xmath4 0 , allowing detection of objects with redder near - infrared colors ( and hence earlier spectral type ) , or faint objects with larger photometric uncertainties that were not identified in our first primary sample .",
    "these color constraints are required to exclude an overwhelming number of background stars , as discussed below , and effectively limit our search to spectral types roughly t4 and later @xcite .",
    "we continue to impose signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , photometric completeness , and reliability constraints by selecting only those candidates with j @xmath4 16 ( s / n @xmath11 10 completeness limit ) and both j- and h - band detections .",
    "second , with the recent completion of 2mass survey operations , we are now able to search the entire sky for t dwarfs , excluding only those regions with very high source densities and hence likelihood of source confusion : the galactic plane ( @xmath12 ) , the large and small magellanic clouds , and various dense or obscured stellar regions such as 47 tuc and the orion nebular cluster .",
    "we have also excluded the equatorial poles ( @xmath13 ) because of restrictions on observational followup . in total",
    ", our current search encompasses 30,400 deg@xmath9 , or 74% of the sky , increasing our previous sample area by over 80% .",
    "we expect to find roughly 15 new t dwarfs in this sample based on the increased areal coverage alone , and up to 10 additional red and/or faint t dwarfs based on the number of objects found in the @xcite auxiliary samples .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the j ",
    "k@xmath8 hess diagram @xcite of our 264,068 2mass - selected candidates , selected from over 1.3 billion sources in the 2mass wpsd , along with the 2mass colors of t dwarfs detected by 2mass and sdss ( table 7 in burgasser et al . , 2002 ; and table 4 in geballe et al . , 2002 ; all photometry from 2mass ) .",
    "the density of candidates is highest near our color constraints , particularly at the early - type end of the @xcite dwarf track and near the turnoff between the dwarf ( late - k to early - m type ) and giant tracks .",
    "the vast majority of these candidates are likely faint background stars , which are densely centered at and around the @xcite tracks . while our 2mass - selected candidates are required to have no optical counterparts within 5@xmath14 in the usno a2.0 catalog @xcite , based on the observed extreme red colors of known t dwarfs ( r  j @xmath15 9 ; golimowski et al .",
    "1998 ) , a substantial number of faint sources , proper motion stars , closely - separated visual binaries , and optically red sources ( the usno a2.0 catalog requires detections in both r and b bands ) remain .",
    "hence , we visually examine multiple - epoch digital sky survey ( dss ) images of all candidate fields to exclude these contaminants . of the roughly 70,000 candidates",
    "so far examined , 99.5% have been eliminated in this manner .",
    "the remaining steps of our search process , as discussed in @xcite , include follow - up near - infrared imaging for the elimination of minor planet contaminants , optical imaging to exclude faint background stars , and near - infrared spectroscopy for final identification .",
    "these follow - up observations are currently underway .",
    "our color and magnitude constraints encompass 20 t dwarfs previously identified by 2mass and sdss , listed in table 18 @xcite it is obscured by its brighter primary in the 2mass imaging data .",
    "distant t dwarfs , such as nttdf 1205@xmath160744 @xcite , ifa 0231@xmath16z1 @xcite , and sori 0538@xmath160236 @xcite are too faint to satisfy our magnitude constraints . ] .",
    "this sample is already larger than that studied by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , seven of these sources have multiple detections in the 2mass wpsd due to overlapping or repeated scans , as listed in table 2 .",
    "these observations , separated by as much as 2 years , enable us to derive mean proper motions for six of the t dwarfs , assuming positional uncertainties of 0@xmath173 .",
    "note that these values have not been corrected for solar motion .",
    "four of the objects , 2mass 0937 + 2937 , sdss 1346@xmath160031 , gliese 570d , and 2mass 2339@xmath161352 , have motions of at least 0@xmath175 yr@xmath18 .",
    "the substantial motions of these objects are not unexpected , given that t dwarfs detected by 2mass are all likely within 20 pc of the sun .",
    "a comparison of the multiple - epoch photometry for the objects listed in table 2 gives some hint of photometric variability .",
    "reasonably significant ( maximum @xmath19 m @xmath15 2@xmath20 ) variations are seen at j - band for sdss 0926 + 5847 ( 2.8@xmath20 ) , 2mass 1237 + 6526 ( 2.1@xmath20 ) , gliese 570d ( 2.8@xmath20 ) , and 2mass 2339 + 1352 ( 3.6@xmath20 ) ; and at h - band for sdss 1346@xmath160031 ( 2.3@xmath20 ) .",
    "it is possible that these photometric variations are intrinsic , as has now been observed for a number of brown dwarfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* enoch , brown , & burgasser , in preparation ) .",
    "@xcite have hypothesized that these variations arise from the motions and evolution of patchy condensate clouds in the upper atmospheres of early- and mid - type t dwarfs ; indeed , the variations appear to be greatest at j - band , as predicted , and possibly more pronounced in the t4.5 sdss 0924 + 5847 and t5.5 2mass 2339 + 1352 ( note the equally strong variation in the t8 gliese 570d , however . )",
    "such low - level photometric variability as measured by the 2mass j - band filter must be considered carefully , however , as the filter bandpass extends well into the 1.4 @xmath1 telluric h@xmath2o band .",
    "this results in substantial variations in the j - band zeropoint ( up to 0.1 mag ) from night - to - night and within a single night ( cutri et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the source of these fluctuations , likely changes in observing conditions ( terrestrial weather and water vapor ) , can potentially affect the photometric calibration of late - l and t dwarfs , as their spectral energy distributions show far more structure in the j - band than earlier - type calibration stars .",
    "such second - order extinction effects could therefore be responsible for the apparent variability seen , and a more directed program is required to validate these observations .",
    "regardless , our complete sample will provide time - resolved astrometric and potentially photometric data for a few individual t dwarfs , in addition to improved population statistics .",
    "2mass 1503 + 2525 is one of the first objects examined in our new wide - field search campaign .",
    "astrometry and photometry for this object are listed in table 1 , while figure 2 shows the 2mass 1503 + 2525 field as imaged by poss - i @xcite , poss - ii @xcite , and 2mass .",
    "this object is one of our brightest candidates , just fainter than the brightest known t dwarf 2mass 0559@xmath161404 @xcite .",
    "the absence of an optical source at the position of 2mass 1503 + 2525 implies r@xmath16j @xmath15 6 @xcite , while its near - infrared colors ( j  h = 0.08@xmath00.05 , h ",
    "k@xmath8 = @xmath160.11@xmath00.08 ) are similar to the t6.5 gliese 229b @xcite .",
    "the optical data also rule out the possibility that this candidate is an earlier - type high - velocity proper motion star , as no such counterpart is seen at either epoch .",
    "note that the bright star 18@xmath14 north and 103@xmath14 east of 2mass 1503 + 2525 is the m5 variable star ex boo ( a.k.a .",
    "iras 15012 + 2537 , bd+25 2864 , hip 73662 ) , classified as a normal giant / supergiant by @xcite . a lower limit on this object s hipparcos distance , d @xmath21 680 pc @xcite , eliminates the possibility that it is associated with the t dwarf .",
    "we imaged 2mass 1503 + 2525 in the near - infrared on 27 june 2002 ( ut ) using the gemini twin - arrays infrared camera @xcite , mounted on the lick observatory shane 3 m telescope .",
    "light cirrus was present and seeing was 1@xmath172 .",
    "short integration ( 20 sec ) , j- and k - band images unambiguously confirmed the presence of 2mass 1503 + 2525 at its 2mass position , and no secondary component was seen at the seeing spatial resolution of the data .",
    "we subsequently obtained low - resolution ( @xmath22 @xmath11 500 ) jhk spectra using the gemini camera s grisms on two separate nights , 28 june 2002 and 19 august 2002 ( ut ) .",
    "conditions for the first night ( j- and k - band spectra ) were affected by heavy cirrus and 2@xmath14 seeing , while smoke and light cirrus ( 1@xmath175 seeing ) were present on the second night ( h - band spectrum ) . for both sets of observations ,",
    "2mass 1503 + 2525 was first acquired in imaging mode and placed into a 1@xmath174 slit .",
    "sets of nodded ( 30@xmath14 ) pairs were obtained with individual integration times of 180300 sec , for total integrations of 1800 sec at j- and k - bands , and 2000 sec at h - band .",
    "nod pair sets of the f8 v hd 133460 were obtained for calibration immediately after the target observations and at similar airmass .",
    "spectral images were pairwise subtracted ; divided by a normalized , median - combined set of flat - field quartz lamp observations ; and corrected for bad pixels by linear interpolation .",
    "spatial curvature was measured using the calibrator star dispersion lines , and spectral curvature was measured from argon lamp spectra obtained during each of the observing runs .",
    "these lamp spectra were also used for wavelength calibration , using the identifications of @xcite .",
    "target and calibrator spectra at each nod position were then individually extracted and interpolated onto a common wavelength scale .",
    "relative flux calibrations and telluric corrections were made by dividing target spectra by calibrator spectra at each nod position , interpolating over paschen and brackett hydrogen lines .",
    "the resulting individual spectra for each band were multiplied by a 6095 k blackbody ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corresponding to spectral type f8 v ) and averaged .",
    "2mass magnitudes were used to flux calibrate the separate bands by the prescription of @xcite .",
    "figure 3 plots the reduced gemini camera grism spectrum of 2mass 1505 + 2525 .",
    "signal - to - noise ratios are roughly 17 at j , 13 at h , and 9 at k. ch@xmath3 bands at 1.15 , 1.4 , and 2.2 @xmath1 , and h@xmath2o bands at 1.1 , 1.3 , and 1.9 @xmath1 are clearly evident , as are the 1.25 @xmath1 k i doublet lines .",
    "the 1.17 @xmath1 k i doublet lines are obscured by noise at the bottom of the 1.1 @xmath1 h@xmath2o and ch@xmath3 absorption trough .",
    "cia h@xmath2 is responsible for the slope on the red side of the k - band peak .",
    "these features are characteristic of mid- and late - type t dwarfs @xcite , and confirm 2mass 1503 + 2525 as a bona - fide t dwarf .",
    "we derived the spectral type of 2mass 1503 + 2525 using the independent classification schemes of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "spectral indices for both schemes sample the major h@xmath2o and ch@xmath3 bands in t dwarf spectra , while the scheme of burgasser et al",
    ".  also includes color indices between the various spectral peaks .",
    "measured ratio values and individual subtype determinations are listed in table 3 , following the procedures outlined by these two classification schemes .",
    "the substantial scatter amongst the geballe et al .",
    "indices is caused by sampling low signal - to - noise regions in the gemini camera spectrum ; similarly , the 2.2@xmath1 ch@xmath3 , k / j 2.11@xmath1/2.07@xmath1 indices in the burgasser et al.scheme are affected by the poor signal - to - noise in the k - band spectrum .",
    "nonetheless , both yield a common spectral type of t5.5 .",
    "we confirm this spectral type in figure 4 by comparing the j- and h - band spectra of 2mass 1503 + 2525 to ukirt cgs4 @xcite spectral data of the t5 2mass 0559@xmath161404 @xcite and the t6 sdss 1624 + 0029 @xcite .",
    "adequate comparison can be made between these data , as their spectral resolutions are similar ( @xmath22 @xmath11 400500 ) and all have been corrected for telluric absorption and flux calibrated .",
    "2mass 1503 + 2525 has stronger h@xmath2o and ch@xmath3 absorption bands than 2mass 0559@xmath161404 , but weaker bands than sdss 1624 + 0029 , consistent with a median type of t5.5 .    as noted above ,",
    "the colors of 2mass 1503 + 2525 are quite blue , for its assigned spectral type of t5.5 , suggestive of either a later spectral type or suppression of k - band flux , as is observed in the possibly high surface gravity or metal - poor t dwarf 2mass 0937 + 2931 @xcite .",
    "however , within the photometric uncertainties these colors are still consistent with other mid - type t dwarfs such as the t5 2mass 0755 + 2212 ( j  h = 0.06@xmath00.17 , h ",
    "k@xmath8 = @xmath160.08@xmath00.26 ) and the t5.5 2mass",

    "higher accuracy photometry of a sample of mid - type t dwarfs is required to determine if the colors of 2mass 1503 + 2525 are unusually blue for its spectral type .",
    "both of the comparison objects in figure 4 have known distances from trigonometric parallax measurements @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the spectrophotometric distance of 2mass 1503 + 2525 from the absolute 2mass magnitudes of these objects and data from table 3 . if we assume this object has a spectral type and hence luminosity similar to 2mass 0559@xmath161404",
    ", it lies between 10.712.0 pc from the sun .",
    "this estimate may be inflated if 2mass 0559@xmath161404 is a multiple system , as suggested by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if 2mass 1503 + 2525 is a later - type , less luminous t dwarf similar to sdss 1624 + 0029 , it lies only 4.95.4 pc from the sun .",
    "the mean spectrophotometric distance between these extremes is 8@xmath03 pc ; hence , if it is single , 2mass 1503 + 2525 is likely within the 10 pc recons distance , and is potentially a member of the 8 pc sample of @xcite .",
    "trigonometric parallax observations are currently underway for 2mass 1503 + 2525 through the usno parallax program ( c.  dahn , priv .  comm . ) .    given its brightness , it is possible that 2mass 1503 + 2525 could be a binary brown dwarf , as roughly 20% of late - m , l , and t dwarfs identified in magnitude - limited searches are found to have binary companions with separations @xmath23 10 au @xcite .",
    "the presence of a companion would increase our distance estimate by up to a factor of 1.4 .",
    "gemini images rule out a bright companion beyond 1@xmath172 , or 613 au assuming on a distance of 511 pc . because the apparent separation limit of brown dwarf binaries is similar to this observational limit @xcite ,",
    "we can not rule out the multiplicity of 2mass 1503 + 2525 with any confidence ; higher - resolution imaging ( ao or space - based ) or radial velocity monitoring are required .",
    "the possibility that 2mass 1503 + 2525 lies within 10 pc of the sun raises the question of how many late - type dwarfs are currently known in this volume .",
    "table 4 lists all l and t dwarfs identified to date which are or may potentially be within the recons 10 pc horizon , based on trigonometric @xcite or spectrophotometric parallax , respectively .",
    "we have used published spectrophotometric parallaxes for the l dwarfs @xcite or computed them using the spectral type / absolute magnitude relations of @xcite , 2mass photometry , and spectral classifications by @xcite .",
    "we derived distances for the t dwarfs by interpolating over spectral type ( using the burgasser et al .",
    "scheme ) between the 2mass j , h , and k@xmath8 absolute magnitudes of the l8 gliese 584c @xcite , t2 sdss 1254@xmath160122 @xcite , t5 2mass 0559@xmath161404 @xcite , t6 sdss 1624 + 0029 @xcite , t6.5 gliese 229b ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the dearth of observed l and t dwarfs worsens dramatically if the substellar mass function is steeper .",
    "the primary reason for this discrepancy is quite simple - searches for these objects using large - scale surveys have not yet examined the entire sky .",
    "sdss and denis programs have only searched a fraction of their final survey area , which ultimately will cover one - quarter and one - half of the sky , respectively .",
    "searches for l and t dwarfs in the all - sky 2mass survey have only examined roughly one - half of the sky .",
    "hence , the expanded areal coverage and color criteria of our current search will likely identify quite a few of the missing nearby t dwarfs , particularly those with spectral types later than t4 .",
    "however , some of the latest - type t dwarfs within 10 pc , and objects significantly less luminous than gliese 570d , may be too faint to be detected by 2mass , sdss , or denis , and will remain to be uncovered in future surveys .",
    "2mass 1503 + 2525 is a key t dwarf discovery not just because of its potential proximity to the sun , but also because it is sufficiently bright to permit both higher - resolution spectroscopic study and investigations outside the 12.5 @xmath1 spectral energy window . in particular",
