    "in the past few years , enormous theoretical efforts have been devoted to understanding folding / unfolding phenomena of proteins and rna observed in single - molecule experiments .",
    "diverse methods including molecular dynamics @xcite , monte carlo method @xcite , and other theoretical models @xcite have been developed .",
    "however , these studies mainly focused on the dynamical behavior of proteins under force , and few concerned about rna @xcite . to fill this gap",
    ", we recently developed kinetic monte carlo simulation methods to investigate the rna kinetic behaviors in constant force and constant extension ensembles on secondary structure level @xcite .",
    "in addition to the intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena , the most direct application of our simulation methods is to investigate the relative simple unfolding behaviors in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "different from complex protein unfolding behaviors even in equilibrium state@xcite , force unfolding rna has been showed to be solved in an exact numerical way in the constant extension ensemble @xcite , though the extension to the constant force ensemble were not reported till now .",
    "one of natural question arises whether our simulations are accurate enough comparing to the numerical method . in this report",
    ", we address this question .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first , in sec .",
    "[ method ] simply review the monte carlo methods developed by us .",
    "then the exact numerical methods for the constant force and the constant extension ensembles are showed . in sec .",
    "[ result ] we compare the simulation and numerical methods in the two ensembles .",
    "we particularly point out the importance of persistent length of rna in predicting unfolding forces .",
    "finally sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] presents our conclusion .",
    "according to the difference of the external controlled parameters , the rna unfolding experiments can be carried out under constant extension and constant force , i.e. , the constant extension and the constant force ensembles @xcite .",
    "one of apparatus for the constant extension ensemble is sketched in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] : a single rna molecule is attached between two beads with rna : dna hybrid ( double - stranded dna or dsdna ) handle ; one bead is held by a pipette , and the other is in a laser light trap . in practice , although two identical handles connect the rna , only one handle is considered in order to simplify our theoretical calculation ; it should not change following discussions . by moving the position of the pipette",
    ", the distance between the two beads and the force acting on the bead in the light trap can be measured with high resolution . on the contrary",
    ", constant force can be imposed on the rna molecules with feedback - stabilized optical tweezers capable of maintaining a preset force by moving the beads closer or further apart .",
    "the monte carlo algorithm is simply reviewed in this section .",
    "first is the method for the constant extension ensemble @xcite .",
    "two simplifications have been made in our model .",
    "we suppose that changes of the extensions of rna and the handle proceed along one direction .",
    "physical effects of the beads are neglected .",
    "consequently , any state of the system can be specified with three independent quantities , the position of the bead with respect to the center of the optical trap , @xmath0 , the end - to - end distance of the handle , @xmath1 , and the rna secondary structure @xmath2 , i.e. the system in @xmath3-state @xmath4 .",
    "here we do not include @xmath5 , the extension of the rna for the sum of individual extensions satisfies constraint condition , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the distance between the centers of the light trap and the bead held by the pipet , and it also is the external controlled parameter in the constant extension ensemble .",
    "the move set for this system is as follow , @xmath8 unfolding the single rna for the constant extension ensemble proceeds in an extended conformational space @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the rna secondary structural folding space , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the contour length of the dsdna handle . given the system state @xmath3 , its whole energy is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the free energy obtained from folding the rna sequence into the secondary structure @xmath16 , and the elastic energies of the optical trap , the handle , and the single - stranded part of the rna are @xmath17 respectively .",
    "in the expression @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the average force of the handle at given extension @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the persistence length . respectively . in the expression @xmath23",
    ", @xmath24 is the average extension of the single stranded part of the rna whose bases ( exterior bases ) is @xmath25 at given force @xmath26 , @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the monomer distance and the kuhn length of the single - stranded rna , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath30 is the inverse function of @xmath24 .    then is the simulation method for the constant force ensemble @xcite .",
    "we proposed an energy expression on the coarse - grain level for the given secondary structure @xmath16 under constant force @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast to the constant extension ensemble , the rna secondary structure @xmath2 can completely specify any state of the constant force ensemble .",
    "therefore , the move set for this ensemble is the same with the set for rna folding without force , i.e. , its unfolding space is @xmath10 .    given the move sets and the unfolding conformational spaces , the rna unfolding for the two ensembles can be modelled as a markov process in their respective spaces .",
    "define the transition probabilities @xmath35 from i - state to j - state satisfying @xmath36 , or the symmetric rule @xcite , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is used to scale time axis of the unfolding process .",
    "we use a continuous time monte carlo algorithm to simulate unfolding process @xcite .",
    "the measurement quantities @xmath39 for the two ensembles can be calculated by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the @xmath42-value in state @xmath3 , and @xmath43 is the inner time of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "for the constant extension ensemble , @xmath42 could be the force exserted on the bead , @xmath44 in the light trap , or the bead - to - bead distance @xmath45 . while for the constant force ensemble , @xmath42 is the molecular extension @xmath7 under the constant force @xmath31 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the simulation time is @xmath47 .",
    "compared to difficult protein folding prediction , the rna secondary structure prediction has achieved great success @xcite .",
    "in particular the partition function method developed later provided strongly physical foundation @xcite .",
    "recently , this method was generalized to the case of rna unfolding in the constant extension ensemble @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we are not ready to choose the formulae presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition to be consistent with the formulae for the monte carlo simulations , the complicated polymer model of single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) therein might not result in many advances in predicting and understanding the rna unfolding phenomena .",
    "the key idea of the partition function method is that the partition function over all secondary structures of a given rna can be calculated by dynamic programming . given the partition function @xmath48 on the sequence segment [ i , j ] with exterior bases @xmath49 , its recursion formula is as follows , @xmath50 where the partition function @xmath51 on the sequence segment [ i , j ] for which the @xmath3 and @xmath52 bases are paired ; vienna package 1.4 provides their calculation codes @xcite .    for a given rna sequence consisting of @xmath53 nucleotides , define the total partition function for the constant extension and the constant force ensemble @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "according the energies mentioned in last section , their expressions can be written as @xmath56 and @xmath57 where the elastic energy @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "correspondingly , the measurement quantities for the constant extension ensemble are the average force @xmath60 and the average extension @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for the constant extension ensemble , respectively .",
    "to compare the exact and simulation methods discussed above , we calculate extension - force curves of three small rna , p5ab , p5abc@xmath63 and p5abc in equilibrium .",
    "their native states under experimental condition are showed in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "these molecules have been studied by the experiment @xcite and simulation @xcite .",
    "we first choose the widely used parameters for our computation : temperature @xmath64 , @xmath65 nm , @xmath66 nm , @xmath67 nm @xcite , @xmath68 nm , and @xmath69 pn / nm @xcite , and the free energy parameters for rna secondary structures at standard salt concentrations : @xmath70=1 m$ ] and @xmath71=0 m$ ] @xcite .    fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] shows these extension - force curves for the sequences for the two ensembles .",
    "we find that the two independent methods achieve highly consistence .",
    "in particular , the three curves of the molecules for the constant extension ensemble also agree with the experimental measurements very well in quantity : the extensional transition of p5ab are all - or - none ; while p5abc has an intermediate state @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we note that , p5abc@xmath63 although has been observed as two - state molecule in the experiment , a weaker intermediate state presents in the constant extension ensemble , while it can not be observed in the constant force ensemble .",
    "if we purchase the precision of our methods , quantitative comparison between the theoretical molecular unfolding force @xmath72 and the experimental measurements of course is essential .",
    "but we find that they do not coincide : in the constant extension ensemble , the experimental unfolding force of p5ab is @xmath73 pn , of p5abc@xmath74a is @xmath75 pn . and of p5abc is @xmath76 pn @xcite ; while our calculations are @xmath77 pn , @xmath78 pn and @xmath79 pn , respectively .",
    "so what causes result to the larger differences between the experiment and the theory ?",
    "the experiment and previous theoretical works contributed the differences to the change of free energy of the rna secondary structure ; this change results from the different ionic concentration of the experiment and the standard condition : in the rna unfolding experiment , @xmath80 mm and with and without @xmath81 mm @xcite . to reproduce the experimental ionic condition ,",
    "a correction on the energy of a base pair equal to @xmath82 + 3.3[mg^{2+}]^{1/2})$ ] has been applied @xcite .",
    "their values are summarized in tab .",
    "[ table ] . besides the three molecules from ref .",
    "@xcite , other unfolding forces of the molecules published in the lectures @xcite are also listed there .",
    "we still see that the ionic correction can not explain the derivation between the theory and experiment .    considering that the free energy parameters of the rna secondary structure were measured in bulk experiments",
    ", one might doubt whether they can be used in single - molecule studies as well as we thought before @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", however , it is known that the mechanical parameter , the persistent length @xmath29 is also sensitive to ionic condition .",
    "although this parameter indeed were measured under a similar experimental conditions with the small rna unfolding experiment ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , their validity for describing small molecules is questionable .",
    "recent fret experiment measured that for shorter ssdna @xmath29 is about 2.2 nm at @xmath80 mm @xcite . if we choose this value in our calculation , the predicted unfolding forces are closer with the experimental measurements ; see tab .",
    "[ table ] . of course",
    ", we can not exclude the intrinsic limitation of our coarse - grain model .",
    "for example , another possible force work formula has been used in the constant force ensemble @xcite .",
    "in this work , we review the monte carlo methods and develop the exact numerical methods to study the force stretching single rna molecules issue .",
    "we respectively compare the two independent method in the constant force and extension ensembles , and find that they agree with each other quite well .",
    "we also point out that only ionic correction on the rna secondary structure alone can not explain the larger discrepancies of the unfolding forces between the theoretical prediction and the experimental measurement ; the ionic correction on the rna molecular mechanical properties should be important .",
    "although the results of the exact numerical method are consistent with the monte carlo method when force stretches single rna in equilibrium , it does not mean the former can completely replace the later .",
    "such situation is similar with the study of 2-dimension ising model in condense matter physics @xcite . compared to the exact method",
    ", the monte carlo method would be more sophisticate in dealing possible more complicated experimental condition .",
    "for instance , recent simulation work could include pseduknots structure @xcite , while the exact partition function technique would be hardly to realize . in our point of view",
    ", monte carlo simulation is more important in studying single molecular non - equilibrium behavior produced by mechanical force , such as folding / unfolding trajectories , force - hysteresis phenomena and unfolding force dependance on loading rates etc @xcite .                                                                    a and p5abc in the two ensembles .",
    "the different symbols are from the simulation methods , and the different lines are from the exact methods .",
    "they agree with each other very well.,title=\"fig : \" ] + ( a ) + a and p5abc in the two ensembles .",
