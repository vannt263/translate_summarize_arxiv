    "correlated fermi systems are of increasing interest in many fields , including plasmas , astrophysics , solids and nuclear matter , ( see kraeft et al .",
    "@xcite ) for an overview . among the topics of current interest",
    "are fermi liquids , metallic hydrogen ( see dasilva et al .",
    "@xcite ) , plasma phase transition ( see schlanges et al .",
    "@xcite ) , bound states etc . in such many particle quantum systems ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is essential .",
    "there has been significant progress in recent years to study these systems theoretically , and especially numerically , ( see e.g. bonitz ( ed . ) @xcite , zamalin et al .",
    "@xcite , filinov , a. v. et al .",
    "a theoretical framework which is particularly well suited to describe thermodynamic properties in the region of strong coupling and degeneracy is the path integral quantum monte carlo ( pimc ) method .",
    "there has been remarkable recent progress in applying these techniques to fermi systems .",
    "however , these simulations are essentially hampered by the fermion sign problem . to overcome this difficulty , several strategies have been developed to simulate macroscopic coulomb systems ( see militzer and pollock @xcite , militzer and ceperley @xcite , and militzer @xcite ) : the first is the restricted pimc concept where additional assumptions on the density operator @xmath2 are introduced which reduce the sum over permutations to even ( positive ) contributions only .",
    "this requires the knowledge of the nodes of the density matrix which is available only in a few special cases .",
    "however , for interacting macroscopic systems , these nodes are known only approximately , ( see , e.g. , militzer and pollock @xcite and militzer and ceperley @xcite ) , and the accuracy of the results is difficult to assess from within this scheme .",
    "recently , we have published a new path integral representation for the n - particle density operator ( see filinov , v. s. , et al .",
    "@xcite , bonitz ( ed . ) @xcite , filinov , v. s. , et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which allows for _ direct fermionic path integral monte carlo _ simulations of dense plasmas in a broad range of densities and temperatures .",
    "using this concept we computed the pressure ( equation of state , eos ) , the energy , and the pair distribution functions of a dense partially ionized and dissociated electron ",
    "proten plasma ( see filinov , v. s. , et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this region",
    "no reliable data are available from other theories such as density functional theory or quantum statistics ( see , e.g. , kraeft et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which would allow for an unambiguous test .",
    "therefore , it is of high interest to perform quantitative comparisons of analytical results and independent numerical simulations , such as restricted and direct fermionic pimc , which is the aim of this paper .",
    "we now briefly outline the idea of our direct pimc scheme .",
    "all thermodynamic properties of a two - component plasma are defined by the partition function @xmath3 which , for the case of @xmath4 electrons and @xmath5 protons , is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the exact density matrix is , for a quantum system , in general , not known but can be constructed using a path integral representation ( see feynman and hibbs @xcite ) , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , whereas @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the hamilton operator , @xmath12 , containing kinetic and potential energy contributions with @xmath13 being the sum of the coulomb potentials between protons ( p ) , electrons ( e ) and electrons and protons ( ep ) .",
    "further , @xmath14 , for @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "also , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. , the particles are represented by closed fermionic loops with the coordinates ( beads ) @xmath19\\equiv [ r^{(0 ) } ; r^{(1)};\\dots ; r^{(n ) } ; r^{(n+1)}]$ ] , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the electron and proton coordinates , respectively .",
    "the spin gives rise to the spin part of the density matrix @xmath22 , whereas exchange effects are accounted for by the permutation operator @xmath23 , which acts on the electron coordinates and spin , and the sum over the permutations with parity @xmath24 . in the fermionic case ( minus sign ) , the sum contains @xmath25 positive and negative terms leading to the notorious sign problem . due to the large mass difference of electrons and protons ,",
    "the exchange of the latter is not included .",
    "recently , we have derived a new representation for the high  temperature density matrices @xmath26 in eq.(2 ) ( see filinov , v. s. , et al .",
    "@xcite ) which is well suited for direct pimc simulations .",
    "a crucial point is that the electron ",
    "proton interaction can be described by an ( effective ) quantum pair potential @xmath27 ( _ kelbg  potential _ , see kelbg @xcite ) . for details of the derivation",
