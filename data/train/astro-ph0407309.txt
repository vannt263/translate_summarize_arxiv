    "over 100 planets have been detected orbiting sun - like stars and the distributions of extrasolar planetary masses and orbital properties are remarkably diverse ( marcy et al .",
    "2003 ; udry , mayor , & queloz 2003 ) . the leading mechanism for explaining the origin of both the extrasolar planets and our solar system s jovian planets is the core - accretion process , in which collisional accumulation of icy planetesimals builds planetary cores with mass @xmath0 .",
    "these cores then accrete nebular gas and reach jovian mass . a long - standing difficulty with the core - accretion hypothesis was that the estimated time required for the core to accrete @xmath1 of gas exceeded the observed circumstellar disk lifetimes ( pollack et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this issue motivated discussion of gravitational instability as an alternative formation process ( boss 2000 ) .",
    "however , updated estimates of the opacity in protoplanetary envelopes imply that jupiter - mass planets readily form via core - accretion in solar - metallicity disks within 2 - 3 myr at radii @xmath2 around solar - mass stars ( hubickyj , bodenheimer , & lissauer 2003 ) .",
    "this relatively short formation time results if the surface density of solid material in the disk is assumed to be three times greater than that of the minimum - mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) .",
    "the resulting core mass was about 16 @xmath3 , somewhat larger than the maximum deduced core mass ( 10 @xmath3 ) for jupiter ( wuchterl , guillot & lissauer 2000 ) .",
    "to explain the low core mass of jupiter , a cutoff of solid accretion beyond a certain core mass is required , and can be explained by nearby planetary embryos that compete for available solid material .",
    "an independent calculation with similar opacities ( inaba & ikoma 2003 ; inaba , wetherill , & ikoma 2003 ) shows that in a disk with eight times the solid surface density of the mmsn , a core of 25 @xmath3 can form in 1 myr at 5 au , so that the total formation time is 23 myr . in this model ,",
    "the fragmentation of planetesimals and the enhancement of the solid accretion rate due to the gaseous envelope ( primarily from gas drag ) are taken into account , although the main gas accretion phase is not calculated .",
    "if the solid surface density is reduced to four times that of the mmsn , an 8 @xmath3 core can still form in 5 myr .",
    "these results imply that somewhat special circumstances are required for the core accretion model to explain the properties of jupiter . assuming that the core accretion model can explain the formation of jovian planets around solar - mass stars",
    ", this paper addresses the question of whether or not jovian planets can form within disks that orbit around m - dwarfs ( low mass stars with @xmath4 ) .",
    "observational surveys are shifting our view of extrasolar planets from an anecdotal collection of individual systems ( e.g. , 51 peg , @xmath5 and , or 47 uma ) to a fuller statistical census in which categories and populations of planets can be clearly delineated ( e.g. , marcy & butler 1998 ; marcy , cochran , & mayor 2000 ; udry et al . 2003 ; marcy et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this emerging statistical view is vital for improving our understanding of the planet formation process , and to see how our own solar system fits into the galactic planetary census .",
    "one of the most remarkable statistical results to emerge from planet searches is that stars with observed extrasolar planets tend to have metallicities that are more than twice that of the average population i star in the immediate galactic neighborhood ( fischer & valenti 2003 ; butler et al .",
    "2000 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "low metallicity stars are deficient in currently detectable ( @xmath6 yr ) jovian - mass planets ( sozzetti et al .",
    "this connection between planets and host - star metallicity can be interpreted as evidence in favor of the core accretion hypothesis , although sigurdsson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) argue that it can also be interpreted as evidence in favor of migration .",
    "metal - rich circumstellar disks have a higher surface density of solids and cores can readily reach the @xmath7 threshold required for rapid gas accretion .",
    "this letter shows that the core - accretion process makes a similar  and readily testable  prediction of the relative frequency of jovian - mass planets as a function of stellar mass .",
    "compared to disks around solar - mass stars , the circumstellar disks orbiting red dwarfs ( @xmath8 ) should be less efficient in producing jupiter - mass planets .",
    "this theoretical treatment assumes that planets form within a circumstellar disk with the following properties .",
    "the surface density @xmath9 = @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the inner and outer disk radii , and @xmath13^{-1}$ ] is the normalization factor required to obtain a total disk mass @xmath14 .",
    "we specify the time dependence through a disk depletion factor @xmath15 so that @xmath16 . observations of protostellar disks ( e.g. , briceno et al .",
    "2001 ) suggest that @xmath17 yr and @xmath18 are reasonable fiducial values . the temperature distributions for both viscously evolving accretion disks and flat , passively irradiated disks have nearly the same power - law form , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is related to the stellar surface temperature by a geometrical factor ( @xmath21^{1/4}$ ] for a flat disk  see adams & shu 1986 ) .",
    "this model uses disks that are flat and passive , and assumes that the disk is isothermal in the vertical direction .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath22 of the star is related to the stellar radius @xmath23 and luminosity @xmath24 through @xmath25^{1/4}$ ] .",
    "we adopt @xmath26 and @xmath27 from published pre - main - sequence stellar evolution tracks ( dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ) .",
    "we use a henyey - type code ( henyey , forbes , & gould 1964 ) to compute the contraction and buildup of gaseous envelopes surrounding growing protoplanetary cores embedded in our evolving model disk .",
    "our method ( kornet , bodenheimer , & ryczka 2002 ; pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) adopts recent models for envelope opacity ( podolak 2003 ) which includes grain settling ( see also hubickyj et al .",
    "the calculation is simplified ( compare with pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) in that it uses a core accretion rate of the form @xmath28 ( papaloizou & terquem 1999 ) , where @xmath29 is the surface density of solid material in the disk , @xmath30 is the orbital frequency , @xmath31 is the effective capture radius of the protoplanet for accretion of solid particles , @xmath32^{1/3}$ ] is the tidal radius of the protoplanet , and @xmath33 is a constant near unity",
    ". an important feature of our present model is that the outer boundary conditions for the planet include the decrease in the background nebular density and temperature with time .",
    "the results of this planet formation calculation are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the first calculation is for a disk around a 1 @xmath34 star with an initial solid surface density @xmath35 g @xmath36 at @xmath37 au , about four times that of the mmsn .",
    "this value is based on an initial gas - to - solid ratio of 70 in the disk ; later on , @xmath29 decreases with time as mass accretes onto the growing planet . a jupiter - mass planet forms in 3.25 myr with a core mass of 18 @xmath3 , consistent with the results of hubickyj et al .",
    "the second calculation is for a disk around an @xmath38 = 0.4 @xmath34 red dwarf with an initial solid surface density of 4.5 g @xmath36 at @xmath37 au .",
    "formation of a jupiter - mass planet does not occur : planet growth has reached only @xmath39 at @xmath40 = 10 myr . at later times , much less than 1 @xmath41 remains in the entire disk .",
    "the resulting planet is similar in mass , size , and composition to uranus and neptune .",
    "figure 2 shows that jovian planet formation around a @xmath42 star is also thwarted at radii of 1 au and 10 au . the lower surface densities ( @xmath29 ) and longer orbital timescales ( @xmath43 ) of m - star disks more than offset the increase in tidal radius @xmath44 and lead to a greatly reduced capacity for forming jovian - mass planets within the core - accretion paradigm .",
    "also , the reduced core mass found in the m - star disk results in much longer times for the accretion of the gaseous envelope ( pollack et al .",
    "figure 2 indicates that although m stars ( red dwarfs ) have a limited ability to form jupiter - mass planets , the formation of neptune - like objects and terrestrial - type planets should be common around these low - mass stars .",
    "this finding is the main result of this paper .",
    "furthermore , the final sizes of these objects correlates with the surface density of solids ( dust and ice ) in the precursor protoplanetary disk and should thus depend on the host star metallicity .",
    "a number of detection methods can potentially confirm a paucity of jupiter - mass planets orbiting m - stars , and also detect neptune - mass objects . given an adequate time baseline , the doppler radial velocity method",
    "( marcy & butler 1998 ) will readily determine whether jupiter - mass planets are common around red dwarfs .",
    "a neptune - mass planet in a circular , @xmath45 , @xmath46=3 au orbit around a @xmath47 primary would have a period @xmath48 , and would induce a stellar radial velocity half - amplitude @xmath49 .",
    "such an object would be marginally detectable using current rv precision of @xmath50 , assuming a high sampling cadence .",
    "the california and carnegie planet search radial velocity program has detected one planetary system orbiting the m - dwarf star gj 876 and @xmath51 other red dwarfs are currently under surveillance .",
    "the gj876 system ( marcy et al . 2001 ) , with @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 , contains two jovian planets ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) with periods @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the system displays clear signs of having undergone migration ( lee & peale 2002 ) , indicating that abundant gas was present in the system when the planets formed .",
    "we argue that standard core - accretion theory predicts that systems such as gj 876 are drawn from the extreme high - mass end of the circumstellar disk mass distribution , and will thus be intrinsically rare . in the alternative formation mechanism ( gravitational instabilities ;",
    "see boss 2000 ) , the growth rate depends primarily on the ratio of disk mass to star mass and instabilities need not be suppressed in disks surrounding low mass stars ( compared to disks around solar - type stars ) . systems",
    "like gj 876 may turn out to be examples of giant planet formation via gravitational instability . on the other hand ,",
    "gravitational fragmentation will not generally produce ice giants ( such as neptune ) , so the discovery of ice giants in extrasolar systems would be an important confirmation of the core - accretion hypothesis .",
    "microlensing is another promising method for determining the census of both high and low mass planets orbiting m dwarfs .",
    "recent work ( bond et al . 2004 ) reports an unusual light - curve for a g - type source star in the direction of the galactic bulge .",
    "the observed light curve is consistent with the passage of an optically faint binary lens with mass ratio @xmath59 for the lensing system .",
    "stellar population models of the galactic disk ( han & gould 1996 ) indicate a @xmath60% a - priori probability that the optically faint lens primary is an m - dwarf ( in which case the planet mass is of order @xmath61 ) and a @xmath62% probability that the primary is a white dwarf ( implying a somewhat higher planet mass ) . in either case , the projected sky separation of the primary  planet system is @xmath63 au .",
    "our calculations imply that m - dwarfs should rarely harbor jupiter - mass planets and favor the possibility that the lensing system has a white dwarf primary .",
    "this prediction can be tested within @xmath62 years as proper motion separates the source star from the lens .",
    "we also predict that the mass spectrum of microlensed planets ( drawn largely from m - dwarf primaries ) should be shifted dramatically toward neptune - mass objects compared to the mass spectrum of planets found by the ongoing rv and transit surveys ( which draw predominantly from primaries of roughly solar - mass ) .",
    "transits provide another method for detecting planets .",
    "a neptune - mass object in central transit around a 0.3 @xmath54 m dwarf produces a photometric dip of approximately 1.5% .",
    "such events are easily observed from the ground using telescopes of modest aperture ( henry et al .",
    "2000 , seagroves et al .",
    "the forthcoming kepler mission ( koch et al . 1998 ) will monitor @xmath643600 m dwarf stars with @xmath65 over its 4-year lifetime , and will easily detect transits of objects of earth size or larger in orbit around m dwarf stars . assuming that icy core masses of @xmath66 can accrete at @xmath67 au , the kepler sample size will be large enough to provide a statistical test of our hypothesis .",
    "within the context of the core - accretion process , this paper argues that m dwarfs face a number of difficulties in producing jupiter - mass planets .",
    "our principal conclusion is that jovian planets should be rare in solar systems orbiting red dwarfs , but neptune - like objects and terrestrial planets should be common around these low - mass stars ( see figures 1 and 2 ) . since disks orbiting solar - type stars readily produce giant planets ( figure 1 ) , we predict that planet properties should vary with the mass of the central star .",
    "this result is straightforward to understand : giant planet formation must take place before the disk gas is dispersed , and the dynamical time scales in m dwarf systems are longer ( the keplerian orbit time scales like @xmath68^{-1/2}$ ] ) .",
    "giant planets form in the outer solar system where ices are frozen onto the rocky building blocks , but the disks around m dwarfs have a much lower surface density in the realm of the nebula beyond the snowline .",
    "the mass supply is smaller by a factor of @xmath69 , the growth rate for planetesimal formation is smaller by a factor @xmath70 , and the late stages of planetesimal accumulation proceed @xmath69 times slower .",
    "all of these effects tend to impede giant planet formation , which must take place before the gas in the nebula is removed .",
    "in addition to the effects calculated herein , planets forming around red dwarfs face additional hurdles .",
    "most stars form in groups and clusters , where external radiation from other nearby stars can efficiently drive mass loss from disks around m stars ( adams et al .",
    "2004 ) . in their youth ,",
    "m stars are almost as bright as solar type stars , but their gravitational potential wells are less deep ; this combination of properties allows the inner disks to be more readily evaporated . for m stars , compared with solar - type stars , photoevaporation due to both external radiation fields and radiation from the central star",
    "can be more effective by a factor of 10  100 ( depending on the environment ) , so the gas in the nebula can be much shorter lived .",
    "star forming regions are dynamically disruptive due to passing binary stars and background tidal forces ; these influences affect circumstellar disks and planetary systems around m stars more effectively than in systems anchored by larger primaries .",
    "finally , all of these difficulties affect not only planet formation , but also planet migration , indicating that very short - period jovian - mass planets should be especially rare near m - stars .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank geoff marcy , paul butler , debra fischer , and steve vogt for useful conversations .",
    "we would also like to thank alan boss ",
