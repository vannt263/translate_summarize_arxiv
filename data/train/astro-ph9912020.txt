    "in the morphological scheme of hubble s `` tuning fork '' , the branch of early  type galaxies comprises the elliptical galaxies and the lenticular or s0 galaxies , which have a bulge and a disk component @xcite .",
    "ellipticals can be further divided into boxy and disky ellipticals according to their isophote shapes @xcite . since disky ellipticals contain small stellar disks they may form a continuous sequence with the s0 galaxies . in a dynamical view",
    ", rotational support decreases from s0 to disky ellipticals whereas the random motion of the stars , measured by the velocity dispersion @xmath1 , gets more and more important .",
    "another common feature of early  type galaxies is the lack of any significant amount of cold gas on global scales so that there is no significant ongoing star formation .    the currently favoured theory that combines cosmology and galaxy formation is the cold dark matter model , which comes in various flavours .",
    "it predicts that galaxies merge hierarchically , i.e. , smaller entities hit one against the other and gradually build up a large galaxy ; the so - called mergertree scenario @xcite . especially in the field , merging disks get heated up until they form a spheroidal , but at a later stage a disk can be formed again when the evaporated gas , which was trapped in the dark halo , is falling back onto the galaxy @xcite . in this way , the mass of a galaxy is increased in jumps each time a merger occurs and a new stellar population may be created which dilutes the underlying older population and makes the mean stellar age younger .",
    "this is described by semi ",
    "analytic @xcite and hydrodynamic sph @xcite models , which are able to incorporate star formation and feedback processes .",
    "on the other hand , stellar population models , which predict the spectra and hence the colours and absorption lines of a galaxy for all time steps of its evolution based on the isochrones of the stellar content , assume just a certain time dependent star formation rate for a single metallicity and initial mass function .",
    "most of them have not yet incorporated the superposition of different stellar populations having various ages and metallicities as the hierarchical merging picture implies ( but see e.g. sansom and proctor @xcite ) . nevertheless , these passive evolution models are able to reproduce the observed properties of both local and distant galaxies ( e.g. , bruzual & charlot , 1993 ) .",
    "the simplest model picks up a short burst of star formation in which all the stars of a galaxy are created , the so - called simple stellar population model ( ssp ) .",
    "it describes the observed evolution of early  type galaxies quite well .",
    "the main features are the rapid decline of the blue luminosity so that the red light is dominating after about 3gyrs , the rapid diminishing of the balmer lines and the strengthening of the metal lines on the same timescale . however , stellar populations are degenerate between age and metallicity . thus , the spectra of ssp s are nearly identical if the age is increased by a factor of 3 and , simultaneously , the metallicity decreased by a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "for example , a spectrum at an age of 15gyrs and a metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath5 looks the same as that at an age of 5gyrs and a metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath6 .",
    "this means that the colours and most absorption lines are degenerate , too , and can not be used to distinguish between age and metallicity effects .",
    "only a few indexes like the balmer lines are more dependent on age and the combinations of some metal lines like [ mgfe ] are more metallicity sensitive , so that they can be evaluated in an age / metallicity diagnostic diagram .",
    "first evidence for an old age of ellipticals in clusters came from the observations of very tight colour ",
    "magnitude @xcite , fundamental plane @xcite and mg@xmath1 @xcite relations in local clusters . the mg@xmath7  absorption index ( @xmath8 ) follows worthey s 3/2rule ( see fig.[mgbtz ] ) and from his ssp models the following time and metallicity dependence can be derived : @xmath9 the observed narrow spread in the mg@xmath7@xmath1 relation of ellipticals in the virgo and coma clusters ( see fig.[mgbs ] ) , therefore , translates into small limits for the dispersion in age and metallicity at fixed velocity dispersion@xcite . for the most massive ellipticals in coma , for example , relative age and relative metallicity are constrained to 17% and 11% , respectively @xcite .",
    "this means in the picture of passive evolution ( i.e. no merging ) , that when mg@xmath7  line strengths of distant and , therefore , younger galaxies are compared with those of nearby ones at the same velocity dispersion @xmath1 , any difference can mostly be attributed to an age effect . in this sense , the mg@xmath7@xmath1 relation breaks the age / metallicity degeneracy and",
    "is a powerful tool to investigate the evolution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "this age determination technique was first applied by us to early  type galaxies in three clusters at a redshift of @xmath10 : abell370 ( @xmath11 ) , ms1512@xmath236 ( @xmath12 ) and cl0949@xmath244 ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "28 nights at the calar alto 3.5m - telescope , 9 nights at the eso ntt and 2 nights at the eso 3.6m - telescope were spent to get 21 good quality spectra . except from a few outliers ( probably e@xmath2a galaxies ) ,",
    "the reduction in the mg@xmath7  absorption is low and the mean offset from the local fit line is about 0.4  ( see fig.[mgbsz ] ) .",
    "this means , that the distant galaxies must be quite old themselves , because the lookback time of about 5gyrs did not produce a higher difference in mg@xmath7  and that they indeed evolved only passively . assuming the metallicity did not change at all during that time , equation[mgbtzeq ] can be transformed to predict the mg@xmath7  absorption for any given age .",
    "it depends , though , on the redshift of formation @xmath14 and the cosmological parameters . in fig.[mgbsz ] , hatched areas indicate the expected location of the mg@xmath7  absorption for two different formation redshifts and a range of plausible values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the comparison with the data points leads to the conclusion , that the observed galaxies must have formed at @xmath17 , the most massive ones even at @xmath18 . but only the bulk of the stars must have come into existence at these epochs , the galaxies themselves could have been assembled at a later time if no new star formation took place during that process .",
    "these observations are still in agreement with cdm models , since these predict , that the last major merger of a galaxy in the cluster environment occurs at about @xmath19 @xcite .    another physical relationship of early  type galaxies is the fundamental plane ( fp ) , which is set by the three observables velocity dispersion @xmath1 , effective or half  light radius @xmath20 and the mean surface brightness @xmath21 within @xmath20 .",
    "it is a consequence of the virial theorem and a slight dependence of the mass - to - light ratio on the mass ( e.g. bender et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "seen edge - on , the fp is very tight and both elliptical and s0 galaxies in the coma cluster follow the same fit line although they are dynamically different @xcite . from the hst images of the three distant clusters we were able to derive accurately the photometric parameters @xcite . transforming the observed magnitudes into restframe @xmath22 magnitudes , they can be compared to the coma galaxies ( see fig.[fp ] ) and a mean brightening of about 0.5 mag for the distant galaxies",
    "is derived .",
    "= 9.5 cm    in the meanwhile , other groups have used the fp as well to study the evolution of early  type galaxies in clusters at different redshifts : abell2218 at @xmath23 @xcite , abell665 @xmath24 @xcite , abell2390 @xmath25 @xcite , cl1358@xmath262 @xmath26 @xcite , cl0024@xmath216 @xmath27 @xcite , ms205304 @xmath28 @xcite and ms105403 @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the combined results strongly favour a purely passive evolution of the stellar populations both in surface brightness and mass - to - light ratio ( see for a summary jrgensen et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for open and @xmath30dominated cosmologies and a salpeter imf @xcite , redshifts of formation greater than 2",
    "are required to yield the corresponding old ages @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the elliptical galaxies , s0 or lenticular galaxies show a dramatic evolution with lookback time in the dense environment of rich clusters .",
    "but this was only recently discovered by images from the _ hubble space telescope _ ,",
    "wfpc2 _ camera made it possible to resolve even the faint galaxies in distant clusters and determine their morphology ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "@xcite ) . apart from the dwarf galaxies , the s0 galaxies form the dominant population in local rich clusters , followed by the ellipticals , whereas spirals contribute roughly only 10%",
    "this situation is very different in rich clusters at a redshift of @xmath31 .",
    "there , spiral and disturbed galaxies make up the major part of the luminous galaxies , whereas s0 galaxies are hardly found ( 1020% ) , see fig.[s0evol ] .",
    "= 9.5 cm    on the other hand , butcher & oemler found a rapid increase in the `` blue '' galaxy population in rich clusters with redshift already twenty years ago @xcite . on average ,",
    "the fraction of `` blue '' galaxies rises from 0.05 in local clusters to 0.25 in clusters at @xmath32 .",
    "early spectroscopy of such bo  galaxies revealed in some cases a spectral energy distribution similar to normal ellipticals but with a stronger absorption of the balmer lines , so that they were dubbed e@xmath2a galaxies ( e.g. butcher & oemler @xcite ) .",
    "the idea behind that was that these post  starburst galaxies were ellipticals who had undergone a second burst of star formation in the recent past ( @xmath332gyrs ) , so that the newborn @xmath34 stars were still responsible for the increased strength of the balmer lines .",
    "but using high  resolution hst images , stellar disks were detected in most of these e@xmath2a galaxies indicating that spirals are the more probable progenitors rather than ellipticals ( e.g. , couch et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "new spectroscopic observations have found in addition a number of dust  enshrouded starburst galaxies and a population of red , passive spiral galaxies with no significant emission lines @xcite .",
    "many other galaxies in the distant clusters have a disturbed morphology and some show clear signatures of past or ongoing interaction or merging @xcite . the majority of the e@xmath2a post  starburst galaxies are located at the rim of a cluster if it is regular or in between subcomponents @xcite . in these regions ,",
    "most of the spiral and irregular galaxies are found , too , whereas the early  type galaxies are concentrated to the core like in local clusters , see fig.[cl1447 ] .",
    "s0 galaxies themselves were found to be bluer at the outskirts of a cluster than in the core @xcite .",
    "= 8.5 cm    all these findings give clear evidence that galaxy transformation is a common phenomenon in clusters so that the morphology of a galaxy can be changed .",
    "there are signs that galaxies interact with each other and even merge together .",
    "but the high velocity dispersion in rich clusters makes the effective cross section for such encounters small , so that the influence of the hot intracluster medium is much more important .",
    "this icm was already detected by the first x  ray satellites , since its temperature is between 1 and 10 million degrees . in nearby clusters ,",
    "hi studies revealed spiral galaxies deficient in hi and a displacement of the hi disk from the stellar disk , which is the larger the closer the galaxy is located to the center @xcite .",
    "this could be caused by ram ",
    "pressure stripping of the icm or tidal interactions between the galaxies .    which mechanisms lead to the transformation into s0 galaxies is still unknown , so that the strong increase in the frequency of s0 galaxies during the past 5gyrs can not yet be explained .",
    "spectroscopic observations have ruled out a simple fading of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the strengths of the balmer absorption lines in some galaxies require that a truncation mechanism must act to cut off star formation very quickly and must also promote bursts of star formation @xcite .",
    "an appealing scenario is that spiral galaxies falling into the cluster from the surrounding field undergo a dusty starburst phase .",
    "this increased activity causes the butcher  oemler effect .",
    "pressure stripping by the icm then leads to a wide spread and rapid decline in the star formation rates resulting into the post  starburst galaxies and red , passive spirals .",
    "however , other processes may be equally important , such as tidal stripping @xcite or galaxy  galaxy interactions @xcite .",
    "the timescale for the transformations described thus far is rather short ( @xmath351gyr , e.g. , barnes and hernquist @xcite ) .",
    "the subsequent evolution takes much longer and the permanent influence of the tidal field of the cluster as a whole ( harassment ) may cause a substantial removal of disk light @xcite .",
    "the end product of this scenario may then be an s0 galaxy ( see the flowchart , fig.[gt ] and poggianti et al .",
    "the determination of morphology is increasingly difficult the more distant and , therefore , fainter the galaxies are , even on hst images @xcite . for example , the average size of l@xmath3 galaxies at @xmath32 is only @xmath36arcsec @xcite .",
    "but even in closer systems it is hard to detect disks and their visibility depends strongly on the inclination .",
    "a round s0 galaxy seen face - on may be classified as an elliptical .",
    "the morphs group has estimated that about 15% of the s0 population may be misclassified as ellipticals independent of redshift .",
    "an additional problem of the past studies is the low number of observed galaxies . in most cases ,",
    "spectra of only a handful or a dozen of the brightest cluster members were taken .",
    "therefore , the evolution only of the more massive galaxies have been studied in fp analyses .",
    "= 6.2 cm = 5.1 cm    to overcome this bias problem , we started a project in 1997 to observe for the first time a great number of early  type galaxies in the cluster abell2218 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "object spectroscopy was done using the ldss2 spectrograph at the william  herschel telescope with three different masks @xcite .",
    "galaxies were selected by a colour criterion and encompass several sub - l@xmath3 galaxies .",
    "the total exposure time of @xmath37 hours allowed the extraction of high signal - to - noise spectra of 48 different early  type galaxies .",
    "the average size of these galaxies is @xmath38arcsec , which allows the accurate determination of the photometric parameters of the subsample of 20 galaxies contained in hst images . for the other galaxies they were measured from @xmath39 photometry obtained at the palomar 5m - telescope . in the hst subsample , there are 9 s0/sb0 galaxies making up 50% and 2 early spirals .",
    "fig.[es0 ] shows bona - fide examples of an elliptical and an s0 galaxy .",
    "five of the galaxies outside the hst field have clear evidence for a disk component , too .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath1 and the line strengths of several absorption lines were measured like for the cluster galaxies at @xmath10 ( see section[e_evol ] ) .",
    "fig.[mgbs_a ] compares the mg@xmath7@xmath1 relation of a2218 to the same local sample as in figs.[mgbs ] and [ mgbsz ] .",
    "the spread of the distant relationship is almost the same as of the local one and the zeropoints are nearly identical within the errors indicating a very old age for the early  type galaxies in a2218 .",
    "the slopes are also not very different from each other , so that the distant and local galaxy samples could have been drawn from the same population ( ks statistics : @xmath40 ) .",
    "but the most striking result is that elliptical and s0 galaxies are equally distributed along the mg@xmath7@xmath1 relation ( ks statistics : @xmath41 ) so that there exist s0 galaxies which are as old as ellipticals at a lookback time of @xmath42gyrs for a2218 .",
    "the two galaxies with very low mg@xmath7  absorption have rather high h@xmath43  values , and could , therefore , be post  starburst galaxies like e@xmath2as .",
    "it is not possible to detect any disk in these two galaxies in the ground  based images ( fwhm @xmath44arcsec ) .",
    "note also , that the two early spirals do not deviate significantly from the mg@xmath7@xmath1 relation .",
    "although most of the absorption line indexes of ssp models are degenerate in age and metallicity ( see section[intro ] ) , it is possible to construct line diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the reason is that some lines are more sensitive to age others more to metallicity .",
    "the balmer lines like h@xmath43 , e.g. , depend very much on age , whereas the combination between mg@xmath7  and fe5270 , [ mgfe ] , is a measurement of the metallicity @xcite .",
    "such a diagram is shown in fig.[mgfehb ] .",
    "the galaxies in a2218 are spread out in age and metallicity with ellipticals and s0s being almost equally distributed . in particular , there are s0 galaxies whose mean age can be fitted both by models for a very old age and by a very young age .",
    "this is in contrast to the trend in the local poor fornax cluster , where the lenticulars are more concentrated towards younger ages @xcite .",
    "there also seems to be a lack of very old and high metallicity galaxies in a2218 . but",
    "these galaxies are also missing in a sample of randomly selected nearby field and virgo cluster early  type galaxies @xcite .",
    "we have determined the structural ( @xmath20 ) and photometric parameter ( @xmath21 ) of the fundamental plane for the 20 early  type galaxies visible on the hst image of a2218 according to saglia et al .",
    "@xcite . in fig.[fp_a",
    "] , we compare the edge - on projection of the fp with that of coma early  type galaxies ( cf . with fig.[fp ] ) .",
    "the scatter is marginally larger than for coma , and the slopes are not significantly different .",
    "there seems to be some difference between elliptical and s0 galaxies with the latter being brighter on average .",
    "if all of the offset is attributed purely to changes in luminosity , then the brightening is marginally consistent with pure passive stellar population models ( e.g. bc98 models , cf .",
    "bruzual and charlot @xcite ) .",
    "in this short review it was shown , that luminous elliptial galaxies in rich clusters do evolve just passively according to the fading of their stellar content .",
    "the bulk of the stars must have been formed at high redshifts ( @xmath17 ) , which is in line of predictions from cdm models in these dense environments .",
    "most of the evidence comes from fundamental plane analyses of several clusters at redshifts from @xmath45 , which is augmented by the study of mg@xmath7@xmath1 relations and age / metallicity diagrams .",
    "in contrast to this smooth evolution , lenticular / s0 galaxies show a dramatic evolution in their frequency .",
    "while they form the dominant population of the bright galaxies in local rich clusters , their number diminishes to a few percent within a lookback time of about 5gyrs . to explain this phenomenon , a scenario was issued , in which spiral galaxies coming from the field surrounding a cluster are gradually transformed into s0 galaxies .",
    "an arriving galaxy does not change its morphology immediately , but first its star formation is truncated due to the quick removal of the gas , most probably by the icm .",
    "subsequently , the permanent tidal interaction with the cluster potential and other galaxies may change its appearance ( bulge - to - disk ratio ) .",
    "together with the fading of the stellar population these processes may then transform the spiral into an s0 galaxy as seen today .",
    "the observation of a large sample of early  type galaxies in the cluster abell2218 at @xmath4 revealed that a refined picture of galaxy evolution is necessary .",
    "half of the 50 galaxies , which are made up by both luminous and sub  l@xmath3 galaxies , are classified as ellipticals , the other half as lenticulars .",
    "both galaxy types are almost equally distributed along the fundamental plane and mg@xmath7@xmath1 relations .",
    "modeling of the age sensitive balmer lines showed that the mean age of the stellar population of both ellipticals and s0 galaxies varies between 2 and 20gyrs in a2218 .",
    "galaxy evolution certainly is science at the very frontier of astronomy and the determination of the kinematics of faint galaxies is only possible with observations at 10m  class telescopes . with the advent of the vlts we embarked on several projects aimed to further disentangle the phenomena connected to galaxy evolution .",
    "these projects encompass the fundamental plane and mg@xmath7@xmath1 analysis of about 15 early  type galaxies in the cluster ms205304 at @xmath46 as well as a detailed study of late  type galaxies in 6 different rich clusters at @xmath47 .",
    "not only the star formation history of the galaxies located between the core and the very edge of the clusters , but also rotation curves and , thus , the mass and dynamics will be measured . as a complement",
    ", the same science will be made with a large sample of 170 field galaxies selected from the fors deep field .",
    "the combined results will put strong constraints on cdm models .    to get a grip on the problem of galaxy transformation within clusters , we also started an intense campaign to observe poor x  ray detected clusters at @xmath48 with ground  based optical ( calar alto , het , gemini ) and radio telescopes ( vla ) as well as with hst and xmm .",
    "the effectiveness of the competing processes invoked to explain galaxy transformation varies according to density and virial temperature of the local environment .",
    "for example , galaxy mergers are most effective in lower galaxy density environments where relative velocities are small ; on the other hand , ram ",
    "pressure stripping is only effective at very high gas densities such as the cores of rich clusters .",
    "therefore , by comparing galaxy evolution in clusters of different environments it is possible to separate the various physical processes that could contribute to the observed transformation in the galaxy population of clusters .",
