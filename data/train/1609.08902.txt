    "two essential properties are correctness and blindness .",
    "the correctness means that the output of the protocol in alice s desired one as long as alice and bob follow the procedure of the protocol is faithfully . on the other hand",
    ", the blindness means that bob can not know any information about alice s inputs , algorithm , and outputs , whenever alice follows the procedure of the protocol . obviously , this protocol is correctness for bob can obtain the faithful qubits after the noise processer . on the other hand , this protocol is also blindness .",

    "( [ receive ] ) . actually , in eq .",
    "( [ receive ] ) , other three items which contains the single photon that can also be verified by adding three auxiliary polarized bell states .",
    "the final success probability of this protocol can be calculated as @xmath75    in the previous work of ref.@xcite , they presented three important bqc protocols over a collective - noise channel .",
    "the first protocol is entanglement - based protocol .",
    "the second is single - photon - based protocol and the third is the coherent - light - assisted protocol .",
    "the common characteristics of three protocol is that they require auxiliary resources , such as entanglement , single photon or coherent light .",
    "moreover , these protocols suppose that bob has powerful qnd measurement , which can distinguish the arriving photons deterministically .",
    "however , they do not explain how to realize such qnd measurement . in current technology , qnd measurement , such as exploiting cross - kerr nonlinearity",
    "has widely discussed in quantum information processing @xcite , but it is still a big challenge in experiment @xcite and it will greatly increase the computation cost .    in conclusion , we have described an efficient anti - noise bqc protocol .",
