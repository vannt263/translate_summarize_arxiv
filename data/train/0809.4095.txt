    "in this paper we develop a method which can be used to establish kazhdan s property @xmath0 for a large class of discrete groups defined by generators and relations .",
    "the paper grew out of an attempt to find an `` algebraic form '' of an approach to property @xmath0 in a paper of dymara and januszkiewicz  @xcite , which applied to a class of groups acting on kac - moody buildings .",
    "it turned out that not only the proof in @xcite can be expressed in a purely group - theoretic language , but it also admits generalizations of various kinds , which yield many new examples of kazhdan groups . the most general criterion for property @xmath0 established in this paper deals with groups associated with a graph of groups over a finite graph @xmath4 , and is applicable whenever the first eigenvalue of certain `` weighted laplacian '' of @xmath4 is sufficiently large ( see section  5 ) .",
    "however , it is the special cases of that criterion and their variations which are of most interest .",
    "the main application of our method and the main result of this paper is the following theorem :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath3 be a finitely generated ( associative ) ring with @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath6 , that is , the subgroup of @xmath7 generated by elementary matrices",
    ". then @xmath8 has kazhdan s property @xmath0 .",
    "-.1 cm    theorem  [ thm : main ] is equivalent to the statement about property @xmath0 for @xmath1 where @xmath9 is a free associative ring in finitely many variables .",
    "following  @xcite , we call the groups @xmath10 _ noncommutative universal lattices_.    in fact , we prove property @xmath0 for an even larger group @xmath11 , the steinberg group over @xmath3 , which naturally surjects onto @xmath1 .",
    "the proof yields an explicit kazhdan constant for @xmath11 with respect to a natural finite generating set ; asymptotically this constant is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the minimal number of generators of @xmath3 ( see theorem  [ steinberg ] ) . for a fixed @xmath13 ,",
    "this bound is asymptotically optimal ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our argument produces an explicit finitely presented group with @xmath0 which surjects onto @xmath1 if @xmath14 or @xmath3 is an algebra over the finite field @xmath15 for some @xmath16 : in the former case the group @xmath17 has such property , and in the latter case , we define such a group in our proof . in particular , we construct an explicit finitely presented group with @xmath0 surjecting onto @xmath18)=sl_3(\\fq[t])$ ] ( for @xmath16 ) , answering a question of shalom  @xcite .    prior to this paper property @xmath0 for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , was known when either @xmath3 is commutative or the stable range of @xmath3 is at most @xmath19  this has been established in the works of shalom  @xcite and vaserstein  @xcite , with explicit kazhdan constants provided by ozawa  @xcite .",
    "while all these three papers are very recent , the study of kazhdan property for @xmath1 has a long history , which we discuss next .",
    "property @xmath0 for the groups @xmath20 and @xmath21)$ ] , with @xmath2 , has been known since the seminal work of kazhdan  @xcite .",
    "however , kazhdan s argument was not direct and relied on the fact that these groups were lattices in higher - rank simple lie groups over local fields for which , in turn , property @xmath0 was verified . in particular ,",
    "the proof in @xcite did not yield any explicit kazhdan constants .",
    "the first `` systematic '' approach to the problem of proving property @xmath0 for chevalley groups over general commutative rings and computing kazhdan constants was given by shalom  @xcite and was based on the brilliant idea of using bounded generation . generalizing a result of burger  @xcite ,",
    "shalom proved that for a finitely generated commutative ring @xmath3 , the pair @xmath22 has relative property @xmath0 .",
    "it followed that whenever @xmath3 is such a ring and the group @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , is known to have bounded elementary generation property , it must also have property @xmath0 , with explicit kazhdan constant .",
    "in particular , using the fact that @xmath23 was known to be boundedly generated by @xmath24 elementary subgroups , shalom has shown that the kazhdan constant of @xmath20 with respect to a natural generating set is @xmath25 . in @xcite ,",
    "kassabov used the techniques from @xcite and a clever combinatorial argument to improve the kazhdan constant for @xmath20 to @xmath26 , a bound which is asymptotically optimal .    until very recently",
    ", virtually nothing was known about the kazhdan property for chevalley groups over rings of krull dimension at least two .",
    "the first major result in this direction is due to kassabov and nikolov  @xcite , who showed that the groups @xmath27)$ ] , with @xmath2 , have property @xmath28 , a weaker version of property @xmath0 .",
    "the proof was based on new @xmath29-theoretic results and uniform bounded elementary generation for finite congruence quotients of @xmath27)$ ] .",
    "shortly afterwards , kassabov  @xcite established relative property @xmath0 for the pair @xmath22 , where @xmath3 is an arbitrary finitely generated ring with @xmath5 ( not necessarily commutative ) , generalizing shalom s theorem from @xcite .",
    "thus , the reduction of property @xmath0 to bounded elementary generation for @xmath1 was extended to the case non - commutative rings .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no new results on bounded elementary generation of @xmath1 have been obtained since then .",
    "however , in @xcite , shalom generalized his method from @xcite and showed that @xmath1 has property @xmath0 as long as every matrix in @xmath1 can be reduced to a matrix from @xmath30 using a uniformly bounded number of elementary transformations .",
    "this is a weaker property than elementary bounded generation and is easily seen to hold whenever @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the stable range of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath3 is commutative , then @xmath33 by a theorem of bass , and thus shalom s argument yields property @xmath0 for @xmath1 , where @xmath3 is any commutative ring of krull dimension at most @xmath34 ( and @xmath2 ) .",
    "vaserstein  @xcite proved that the desired `` elementary bounded reduction ''",
    "property holds for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , over any commutative noetherian ring @xmath3 of finite krull dimension .",
    "the latter implies property @xmath0 for @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is an arbitrary finitely generated commutative ring .",
    "finally , we note that the argument in @xcite does not provide explicit kazhdan constants ; however , this problem has been resolved by ozawa @xcite who found a `` quantitative '' version of shalom s proof .",
    "the bounded generation method of shalom and its generalizations are usually considered to be algebraic methods .",
    "they are often contrasted with a broadly defined geometric approach to property @xmath0 which is applicable to groups acting on buildings with certain spectral conditions on 1-dimensional links . in @xcite , dymara and januszkiewicz established property @xmath0 for a class of groups acting on kac - moody buildings , using the notion of @xmath35-orthogonality .",
    "while this method is presented in geometric terms in @xcite , many results from @xcite concerning property @xmath0 can be formulated ( and proved ) in a purely group - theoretic setting .",
    "such an algebraization of dymara - januszkiewicz s method is presented in section  3 of our paper , with some auxiliary results on hilbert space geometry obtained in section  2 .",
    "we now briefly describe this approach .",
    "let @xmath8 be a group generated by two subgroups @xmath36 and @xmath29 .",
    "suppose we know that @xmath36 and @xmath29 have @xmath0 , and we want to prove that @xmath8 has @xmath0 . then we need to show that for any unitary representation @xmath37 of @xmath8 without invariant vectors , a vector from @xmath38 ( the fixed subspace of @xmath36 ) can not be arbitrarily close to a vector from @xmath39 .",
    "closeness between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is measured by the quantity @xmath40 , and we say that @xmath36 and @xmath29 are @xmath35-orthogonal for some @xmath41 if @xmath42 for any unitary representation @xmath37 of @xmath8 with @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath44 has @xmath0 as long as @xmath36 and @xmath29 are @xmath35-orthogonal for some @xmath45 .",
    "this criterion is very hard to apply directly to an infinite group @xmath8 since it requires detailed knowledge of the representation theory of @xmath8 .",
    "what one can effectively apply is the following generalization : if @xmath8 is generated by @xmath19 subgroups @xmath46 such that each @xmath47 has @xmath0 , and any two subgroups @xmath47 and @xmath48 are @xmath35-orthogonal for sufficiently small @xmath35 ( where `` sufficiently small '' depends on @xmath19 ) , then @xmath8 has @xmath0 .",
    "the arguments in @xcite ( or rather their group - theoretic counterparts ) prove this statement for @xmath49 , but this result can be improved in several ways .",
    "first , instead of requiring that each @xmath47 has @xmath0 it suffices to require that each pair @xmath50 has relative property @xmath0 .",
    "second , the upper bound on @xmath35 can be significantly improved from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "thus , we obtain the following result ( see corollary  [ tn ] for a more detailed statement , including explicit kazhdan constant estimates ) :    [ thm12 ] let @xmath8 be a group generated by subgroups @xmath46 .",
    "suppose that the pair @xmath50 has relative property @xmath0 for each @xmath53 , and any two subgroups @xmath47 and @xmath48 are @xmath35-orthogonal for some @xmath54",
    ". then @xmath8 has property @xmath0 .",
    "theorem  [ thm12 ] for @xmath55 will already be established in section  3 , but for larger @xmath19 it will be deduced from our spectral criterion ( theorem  [ gg1 ] ) .",
    "the key concept which appears in the statement of that criterion ( and also enters the bound for the kazhdan constant ) is that of _ codistance _ between a finite family of subgroups of a given group ( see subsection 2.2 for details ) .",
    "we now give a brief outline of the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "if one wants to prove that a group @xmath8 has @xmath0 using theorem  [ thm12 ] or some variation of it , one should consider the class @xmath56 consisting of subgroups @xmath36 of @xmath8 such that @xmath57 has relative @xmath0 ( note that all finite subgroups of @xmath8 belong to @xmath56 ) , and then look for families of pairwise almost orthogonal subgroups within @xmath56 which generate @xmath8 .",
    "it is easy to see that any two commuting subgroups will be @xmath58-orthogonal ; however , using only such pairs , one can not construct interesting new examples of groups with @xmath0 .",
    "a much deeper result will be obtained in section  4 , where we show that if @xmath59 is a group of nilpotency class two generated by abelian subgroups @xmath60 and @xmath4 , then @xmath60 and @xmath4 are @xmath61-orthogonal .",
    "moreover , the orthogonality constant can be improved under additional assumptions on @xmath59 .",
    "now let @xmath6 where @xmath3 is a finitely generated associative ring with @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath8 is clearly generated by @xmath19 abelian subgroups ( root subgroups ) , each pair of which generates a subgroup of nilpotency class @xmath62 .",
    "a more delicate analysis shows that the same can always be done using just three abelian subgroups @xmath63 such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are @xmath64}}}$]-orthogonal where @xmath65 is the minimal index of a right ideal in @xmath3 .",
    "thus , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are pairwise @xmath35-orthogonal for some @xmath68 whenever @xmath69 or @xmath70 . using kassabov s variation of shalom s theorem on relative property @xmath0 for @xmath71",
    ", we will show that each pair @xmath50 has relative property @xmath0 , and thus deduce from theorem  [ thm12 ] that @xmath6 has @xmath0 .",
    "the argument we just sketched proves property @xmath0 not only for the group @xmath1 ( under the additional assumption @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) but for an explicit finitely presented cover of it .",
    "it was proved by shalom  @xcite that every discrete group with @xmath0 has a finitely presented cover with @xmath0 ; however , to the best of our knowledge , no explicit finitely presented cover with @xmath0 for groups of the form @xmath1 was known except for the cases when @xmath1 itself was known to be finitely presented and known to have @xmath0 ( see the end of subsection 6.1 for a more detailed discussion ) .    to deal with the remaining cases when both @xmath72 and @xmath19 are small",
    ", we give a different proof of property @xmath0 which works for any ring @xmath3 and any @xmath2 and in fact yields a better kazhdan constant .",
    "we use a variation of our spectral criterion to prove that the kazhdan constant @xmath73 is positive where @xmath60 is the union of @xmath74 abelian subgroups . quite amazingly",
    ", the only fact about @xmath1 used here is that it is `` graded by a root system of type @xmath75 '' in the suitable sense ( see subsection  5.4 ) .",
    "then , as with the other proof , we finish the argument by using relative property @xmath0 for @xmath76 or rather certain generalization of it established in @xcite .    as an immediate application of theorem  [ thm : main ] , we obtain a simple example of a profinite group @xmath8 containing dense finitely generated abstract subgroups @xmath77 and @xmath78 such that @xmath77 is amenable and @xmath78 has property @xmath0 .",
    "this gives a counterexample to a conjecture of lubotzky - weiss ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture  1.2 ) , strengthening an earlier result of kassabov  @xcite  see subsection 6.3 .",
    "we believe that the method introduced in this paper has vast potential to produce new examples of non - linear kazhdan groups .",
    "this problem is addressed in the last section of this paper , where we introduce a large class of groups which we call kac - moody - steinberg groups , and show that many of these groups have property @xmath0 .",
    "these kac - moody - steinberg groups are given by simple presentations , and quotients of the groups from this class include the linear groups @xmath1 discussed above as well as parabolic subgroups of kac - moody groups with simply - laced dynkin diagrams .",
    "we use kac - moody - steinberg groups to construct new examples of golod - shafarevich groups with property @xmath0 , improving and generalizing the main result from @xcite . finally , we believe that one may be able to establish the expanding property for some families of finite groups by realizing them as quotients of kac - moody - steinberg groups .",
    "in section  2 we introduce and study the notions of @xmath35-orthogonality and codistance for subspaces of hilbert spaces . in section  3",
    "we define basic concepts related to property @xmath0 and describe an approach to property @xmath0 via @xmath35-orthogonality . in section  4",
    "we establish several results about representations of nilpotent groups of class two . in section  5",
    "we state and prove our main spectral criterion for property @xmath0 and its variations .",
    "proof of property @xmath0 for @xmath1 and some related results are contained in section  6 . finally , in section  7 we discuss kac - moody - steinberg groups .",
