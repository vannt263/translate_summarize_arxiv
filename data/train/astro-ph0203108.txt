    "elliptical galaxies are the most massive galaxies and are generally found in dense environments . in the context of hierarchical models ,",
    "they represent an advanced step in the galaxy formation process .",
    "their mass distributions and dark halo properties , while not yet as well - understood observationally as those of spiral galaxies , are of considerable interest .",
    "x - ray and gravitational lensing studies imply mass - to - light ratios @xmath2 on scales of @xmath3 for the most massive ellipticals containing hot gas atmospheres . here",
    "the new xmm and chandra satellite data will lead to mass measurements of unprecedented resolution and accuracy .    in the central @xmath0 , mass distributions",
    "@xmath4 may be determined from absorption - line profile measurements and dynamical models .",
    "planetary nebulae and globular clusters can be used as discrete velocity tracers to @xmath5 ( typical effective radii @xmath6 are in the range 3 - 10 kpc ) . in less massive , gas - poor systems these",
    "may give the main constraints on @xmath4 . in gas - rich ellipticals where @xmath4 can be accurately determined from the x - ray gas emission",
    ", the stellar - kinematic data will constrain the orbit structure best .",
    "the following sections give a brief review of the dynamical analysis of the stellar - kinematic data , and the results obtained so far on mass distributions in ellipticals and on their dynamical family properties .",
    "as is well known , velocity dispersion profile measurements ( and streaming velocities , if the galaxy rotates ) do not suffice to determine the distribution of mass with radius , due to the degeneracy with orbital anisotropy . only with very extended measurements",
    "can a constant @xmath7 model be ruled out ( e.g. , saglia 1993 ) , but even then the detailed @xmath4 remains undetermined .",
    "absorption line profile shapes ( giving line - of - sight velocity distributions @xmath8 , losvd for short ) , however , contain additional information with which this degeneracy can largely be broken .",
    "simple spherical models are useful to illustrate this ( gerhard 1993 ) : at large radii , radial orbits are seen side - on , resulting in a peaked losvd ( positive gauss - hermite parameter @xmath9 ) , while tangential orbits lead to a flat - topped or double - humped losvd ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "similar considerations can be made for edge - on or face - on disks ( bender 1990 , magorrian & ballantyne 2001 ) and spheroidal systems ( dehnen & gerhard 1993 ) .",
    "one may think of the losvds constraining the anisotropy , after which the jeans equations can be used to determine the mass distribution . however , the gravitational potential influences not only the widths , but also the shapes of the losvds ( see illustrations in gerhard 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , eccentric orbits visit a range of galactic radii and may therefore broaden a losvd near their pericentres as well as leading to outer peaked profiles .",
    "thus , in practise , the dynamical modelling to determine the orbital anisotropy and gravitational potential must be done globally , and is typically done in the following steps :    \\(0 ) choose geometry ( spherical , axisymmetric , triaxial ) ;    \\(1 ) choose dark halo model parameters , and set total luminous plus dark matter potential @xmath11 ;    \\(2 ) write down a composite distribution function ( df ) @xmath12 , where the @xmath13 can be orbits , or df components such as @xmath14 , with free @xmath15 ;    \\(3 ) project the @xmath13 to observed space , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the projection operator for observable @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denotes the line - of - sight coordinate and the velocities ;    \\(4 ) fit the data @xmath20 for all observables @xmath18 simultaneously , minimizing a @xmath21 or negative likelihood , and including regularization to avoid spurious large fluctuations in the solution .",
    "this determines the @xmath15 , i.e , the best df @xmath22 , given @xmath11 , which must be @xmath23 everywhere ;    \\(5 ) vary @xmath11 , go back to ( 1 ) , and determine confidence limits on the parameters of @xmath11 .",
    "+ such a scheme was employed , e.g. , using orbits in spherical potentials by rix ( 1997 ) and romanowsky & kochanek ( 2001 ) ; using df components in spherical potentials by gerhard ( 1998 ) , saglia ( 2000 ) , and kronawitter ( 2000 ) ; with orbits in axisymmetric geometry by cretton ( 2000 ) and gebhardt ( 2000 ) ; and with df components in axisymmetry by matthias & gerhard ( 1999 ) and statler ( 1999 ) .",
    "the modelling techniques used to constrain black hole masses from nuclear kinematics and dark halo parameters from extended kinematics are very similar .",
    "line - profile shape parameter measurements are now available for many nearby ellipticals ( e.g. , bender , saglia & gerhard 1994 ) , but those reaching to @xmath24 are still scarce ( see kronawitter 2000 ) .",
    "modelling of the mass profiles of ellipticals from such data has been done for some two dozen round galaxies in the spherical approximation , and for a few cases using axisymmetric three - integral models .",
    "typically the models that fit individual galaxies best imply small to modest amounts of dark matter within @xmath25 , but there are ellipticals which are very well represented by constant @xmath7 models out to these radii .",
    "most results obtained so far are from spherical models for round ellipticals ; their mass distributions and radially anisotropic orbit structure are discussed in the next section .",
    "the effects of intrinsic deviations from sphericity and of embedded , near - face - on disks have been discussed by kronawitter ( 2000 ) , magorrian & ballantyne ( 2001 ) , and gerhard ( 2001 ) .",
    "axisymmetric models exist only for very few ellipticals . in ngc 1600 ( e3.5 , matthias & gerhard 1999 ) , ngc 2300 ( e2 , kaeppeli 1999 ) , ngc 2320 ( e3.5 , cretton , rix & de zeeuw 2000 ) , and ngc 3379 ( e1 , gebhardt 2000 ) radially anisotropic structure at @xmath26 has been inferred from three - integral models along the major axis , similar to that found in the round galaxies , but with less anisotropy on the minor axis .    because the dark matter fraction inside @xmath25 is still modest , and the orbit structure in the outer main bodies of ellipticals is not well - constrained by data that end at @xmath25 , it will be important to include discrete velocity data from planetary nebulae ( pn ) or globular clusters ( gc ) that reach to larger radii .",
    "such data can be included directly in the above modelling scheme , using a likelihood maximization ( romanowsky & kochanek 2001 ) , or can be used a posteriori to differentiate between dynamical models at radii beyond the absorption line data on which these are based ( saglia 2000 ) .",
    "the number of ellipticals with such data is still small , but is expected to be growing rapidly thanks to the special purpose pn spectrograph ( douglas 2002 ) and ongoing programs with globular cluster samples around ellipticals .",
    "typically one may expect a few hundred discrete velocities per galaxy from these programs .",
    "using slitless spectroscopy at the vlt mndez ( 2001 ) succeeded in measuring 535 pn radial velocities around the e5 galaxy ngc 4697 .",
    "detailed modelling of these data is still in progress , but simple models for this relatively low luminosity elliptical galaxy are consistent with constant @xmath7 out to @xmath27 , in agreement with dejonghe ( 1996 ) .",
    "two particularly interesting cases are the central galaxies of the fornax and virgo clusters , ngc 1399 and m87 . from a comparison of dynamical models for the absorption line kinematics ( saglia 2000 ) with the mass distribution obtained from asca data ( ikebe 1996 )",
    ", it appears that pn ( arnaboldi 1994 ) and gc velocities ( richtler 2001 ) are just in the right radial range to allow a study of the transition between the potential of the central ngc 1399 galaxy and the potential of the fornax cluster .",
    "similarly , from a study of the stellar kinematics and the gc velocities around m87 , and a comparison to the x - ray mass profile , romanoswky & kochanek ( 2001 ) find a rising circular velocity curve , and suggest that the potential of the virgo cluster may already dominate at @xmath28 from the center of m87 .",
    "the discussion in this section is based on the work of kronawitter ( 2000 ) and gerhard ( 2001 ) , who analyzed the line - profile shapes of a sample of 21 mostly luminous , slowly rotating , and nearly round elliptical galaxies in a uniform way , using spherical dynamical models . a similar study using three - integral axisymmetric models will be very worthwhile , but is still some time away .",
    "the sample of kronawitter includes a subsample with mostly new extended kinematic data , reaching to @xmath0 , and a subsample based on the less extended older data of bender ( 1994 ) .",
    "based on these data and on photometry , non - parametric spherical models were constructed from which circular velocity curves , anisotropy profiles , and radial profiles of @xmath7 were derived , including confidence ranges .",
    "the main results from this study are as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the circular velocity curves ( cvcs ) of elliptical galaxies are flat to within @xmath29 for @xmath30 to at least @xmath31 , independent of luminosity ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the cvc is a convenient measure of the potential even though luminous elliptical galaxies do not rotate rapidly .",
    "quantitatively , the median ratio of the circular velocity at the radius of the outermost kinematic data point , @xmath32 , to the maximum circular velocity of the respective best model , @xmath33 , is 0.94 , with @xmath34 confidence ranges of @xmath35 .",
    "this argues against strong luminosity segregation in the dark halo potential .",
    "\\(2 ) despite the uniformly flat cvcs , there is a spread in the ratio of the cvcs from luminous and dark matter , i.e. , in the radial variations of cumulative mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the sample includes galaxies with no indication for dark matter within @xmath25 , and others where the best dynamical models result in local @xmath36s of 20 - 30 at @xmath25 . as in spiral galaxies ,",
    "the combined rotation curve of the luminous and dark matter is flatter than those for the individual components ( `` conspiracy '' ) .",
    "\\(3 ) most of these ellipticals are moderately radially anisotropic , with average @xmath37 , again independent of luminosity .",
    "the dynamical structure of ellipticals is therefore surprisingly uniform .",
    "the maximum circular velocity is accurately predicted by a suitably defined central velocity dispersion .",
    "averaging @xmath38 within @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "\\(4 ) elliptical galaxies follow a tully - fisher ( tf ) relation with marginally shallower slope than spiral galaxies ( see also magorrian & ballantyne 2001 ) . at given circular velocity , they are about 1 mag fainter in b and about 0.6 mag in r , and appear to have slightly lower baryonic mass than spirals , even for the maximum @xmath36 allowed by their kinematics ( minimum dark halo models ) . the residuals from the tf ( and fundamental plane , fp ) relations",
    "do not correlate with dynamical anisotropy @xmath41 .    , and normalized by the maximum circular velocity .",
    "the upper panel shows the galaxies from the extended kinematics subsample , the lower panel the galaxies from the subsample with older data from bender ( 1994 ) . from gerhard ( 2001 ) . ]",
    "\\(5 ) the luminosity dependence of @xmath36 indicated by the tilt of the fp corresponds to a real dependence of dynamical @xmath36 on @xmath42 .",
    "the tilt of the fp is therefore not due to deviations from homology or a variation of dynamical anisotropy with @xmath42 , although the slope of @xmath36 versus @xmath42 could still be influenced by photometric non - homology .",
    "the tilt can also not be due to an increasing dark matter fraction with @xmath42 , unless ( i ) the most luminous ellipticals have a factor @xmath43 less baryonic mass than spiral galaxies of the same circular velocity , and ( ii ) the range of imf is larger than currently discussed , and ( iii ) the imf or some other population parameter varies systematically along the luminosity sequence such as to undo the increase of @xmath36 expected from simple stellar population models for more metal - rich luminous galaxies .",
    "this seems highly unlikely .",
    "\\(6 ) the tilt of the fp is therefore best explained as a stellar population effect .",
    "population models show that the values and the change with @xmath42 of the maximal dynamical @xmath36s are consistent with the stellar population @xmath36s based on published metallicities and ages , within the uncertainties of imf and distance scale . because of ( 5 ) above and because the observed correlation between age and luminosity is far too weak to explain the @xmath44 relation ( forbes & ponman 1999 ) , the main driver of the b - band tilt is therefore probably metallicity .",
    "this would not explain the observed k - band tilt , which must then be explained by a secondary population effect .",
    "\\(7 ) the population models show that the dynamical models would have overestimated the luminous masses of these elliptical galaxies by as much as a factor @xmath45 only if ( i ) the flattest imfs at low stellar masses discussed for the milky way are applicable , and simultaneously ( ii ) a short distance scale ( @xmath46 ) turns out to be correct . for lower values of @xmath47 and/or other imfs",
    "the difference is smaller .",
    "together with ( 4 ) this makes it likely that elliptical galaxies have indeed nearly maximal @xmath36 ratios ( minimal halos ) .",
    "\\(8 ) in the models with maximum stellar mass , the dark matter contributes @xmath48 of the mass within @xmath6 .",
    "the flat cvc models , when extrapolated beyond the range of kinematic data , predict equal interior mass of dark and luminous matter at @xmath49 , consistent with results from x - ray analyses .",
    "\\(9 ) even in maximum stellar mass models , the halo core densities and phase - space densities are at least @xmath50 times larger and the halo core radii @xmath51 times smaller than in maximum disk spiral galaxies with the same circular velocity ( persic , salucci & stel 1996 ) .",
    "correspondingly , the increase in @xmath7 sets in at @xmath52 times larger acceleration than in spirals .",
    "this could imply that elliptical galaxy halos collapsed at high redshifts or perhaps even that some of the dark matter in ellipticals might be baryonic ."
