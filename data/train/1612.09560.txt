    "the essential reason why all these estimates hold remains hidden .    in 1985",
    "van gils and horozov @xcite gave an overview of the varous methods , which have been used at this time to prove the uniqueness of the limit cycles for the perturbations of the generalized lotke - volterra system ( [ glv ] ) .",
    "the central result of their paper is that in the particular case , in which @xmath15 is an integer , the functions @xmath16 satisfy a picard - fuchs equation of second order , whose coefficients are rational in @xmath17 .",
    "the authors used then topological arguments as the rolle s theorem , to bound the zeros of @xmath18 in terms of the degrees of the coefficients of the picard - fuchs equation , from which the result of zoladek @xcite follows .    more precisely , if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the critical values of the lotka - volterra integral @xmath21 , then the abelian integral @xmath18 ( [ abelian ] ) allows an analytic continuation from @xmath22 to a small neighbourhood of @xmath23 .",
    "this follows from the picard - lefschetz formula and the fact , that the oval @xmath24 represents a cycle vanishing at @xmath23 . at the other end of the interval , at @xmath25 ,",
    "the function is not analytic , but has a logarithmic type of singularity , as it follows from a generalised picard - lefschetz formula @xcite .",
