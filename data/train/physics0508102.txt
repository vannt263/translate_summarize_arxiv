    "cerebral autoregulation ( ca ) is the ability of cerebral blood vessels to maintain steady cerebral perfusion in response to fluctuations of systemic blood pressure ( bp ) , postural changes or metabolic demands .",
    "this regulatory mechanism is known to operate over a range of blood pressure values ( e.g. 80 - 150 mm hg )  @xcite and on time scales of a few heartbeats  @xcite .",
    "the long - term ca compensates for chronic bp elevations and metabolic demands  @xcite .",
    "ischemic stroke is associated with an impairment of autoregulation  @xcite , that may permanently affect cerebrovascular reactivity to chemical and blood pressure stimuli  @xcite . with impaired ca , the cerebral blood flow follows bp fluctuations , posing a risk of insufficient blood supply to the brain during transient reductions in peripheral bp .",
    "therefore , evaluating the effectiveness of ca is of great interest , given the clinical implications .",
    "traditional experimental methods evaluating the mechanism of ca require time - consuming invasive procedures  @xcite and are focused on long term bp and blood flow velocities ( bfv ) characteristics such as the mean , lacking descriptors of temporal bp - bfv relationship . to address this problem ,",
    "an alternative `` dynamic '' approach has been proposed  @xcite to quantify ca using transcranial doppler ultrasound during the transient responses in cerebral bfv to the rapid bp changes induced experimentally by thigh cuff inflation , valsalva maneuver , tilt - up , or a change in posture  @xcite .",
    "the autoregulation indices derived from this approach may be more sensitive to indicators of hypoperfusion after stroke  @xcite .",
    "the analytic methods evaluating the dynamics of cerebral autoregulation are currently based on mathematical modeling and fourier transform analysis  @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform based transfer function method has been widely used  @xcite .",
    "this method estimates the relative cross - spectrum between bp and bfv signals in the frequency domain .",
    "dynamic indices of autoregulation , based on fourier transform methods , presume ( i ) signal stationarity ( i.e. , the mean and standard deviation of the signal are stable and remain invariant under a time shift ) and ( ii ) a linear bp - bfv relationship",
    ". however , physiologic signals are often nonstationary reflecting transient responses to physiologic stimuli  @xcite .",
    "the effect of this nonstationarity on the results obtained from the transfer function analysis has not been carefully assessed in previous studies .    here",
    "we investigate the dynamics of the bp - bfv relationship when the system reaches the quasi - steady state after an initial perturbation .",
    "while studies traditionally have focused on the response in bfv to transient changes in bp  @xcite , we hypothesize that spontaneous physiologic fluctuations during the quasi - steady state , which is characterized by absence of physiologic stimuli or constant level of stimulation , may also contain important information about the ca mechanism .",
    "our focus on fluctuations in the bp and bfv is motivated by previous work which has demonstrated that physiologic fluctuations contain important information about the underlying mechanisms of physiologic control .",
    "robust temporal organization was reported for the fluctuations characterizing cardiac dynamics ( inter - beat intervals )  @xcite , respiratory dynamics ( inter - breath intervals )  @xcite , locomotion ( gait , fore - arm motion )  @xcite , and brain dynamics  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated that physiologic fluctuations carry information reflecting the coupling between different physiologic systems , e.g. , correlations in the heartbeat change with physical activity  @xcite , with wake and sleep  @xcite , during different sleep stages  @xcite , and even different circadian phases  @xcite .",
    "bp and bfv signals are impacted by the heartbeat , and thus one can expect that fluctuations in bp and bfv may reflect modulation in the underlying mechanisms of control .",
    "previous studies have focused on the transitional changes in bp and bfv in response to abrupt perturbation of the physiologic state , e.g. , rapid switch from supine to tilt .",
    "in contrast , we focus on the dynamical characteristics of bp and bfv signals after the initial perturbation , when the system has reached a quasi - steady state during which there is no change in physiologic stimuli .",
    "further , we hypothesize that certain dynamical characteristics of the fluctuations in bp and bfv at the steady state , and how these characteristics change for different physiologic conditions , may reflect aspects of the underlying mechanism of ca .",
    "for example , under normal ca the fluctuations of the bfv in healthy subjects at the steady state may relate to high frequency adjustments ( even within a single heartbeat ) of the diameter of the cerebral blood vessels , while loss of ca after stroke may lead to impaired vascular dilation or contraction associated with reduced fluctuations in bfv .",

    "we evaluate the time - domain characteristics of both the amplitudes and the instantaneous phases of the bp and bfv which can be considered as two interacting subsystems within the ca mechanism . to determine the characteristics of the coupling between bp and bfv in healthy subjects and how they change with stroke , we analyze the cross - correlation between the instantaneous phase increments of these two signals .",

    "however , the difference in the maximum cross - correlation value @xmath179 is not significant ( see table iii ) , the reason being that the general shape of the bp and bfv oscillations at each heartbeat is very similar for both healthy and post - stroke subjects , and in addition , the amplitude of bp and bfv oscillations is much larger relative to the small random fluctuations on top of these oscillations .",

    "[ fig01n3 ] , the result of the phase synchronization analysis is very different when considering instantaneous phase difference with a time delay  the histogram of the phase difference becomes much broader ( the entropy index @xmath106 much smaller ) compared to the case when no time delay is introduced .",

    "we find that the patterns of the cross - correlation function @xmath81 of the instantaneous phase increments @xmath120 of the bp and bfv signals are very different for the stroke group compared to the control group .",
    "in general , the cross - correlation function @xmath81 for the control group is characterized by smaller amplitude and faster decay ( time lag @xmath82 less than 10 seconds ) [ fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ] .",
    "in contrast , for post - stroke subjects , the amplitude of the cross - correlation function @xmath81 is much larger and decays much slower ( over time lags larger than 10 seconds ) [ fig .  [ fig03 ] ] .",
    "thus for those post - stroke subjects the changes of the phase of bfv will change in the approximately same way with that of bp signals , indicating a strong synchronization .",
    "the correlations at short time scales ( less than 10 seconds ) may be partially attributed to the effect of heart rate ( @xmath1821 sec ) and respiration ( @xmath1825 seconds) i.e. , they reflect the effect of other body regulations ( similar to``background noise '' ) on both bp and bfv signals .",
    "when cerebral autoregulation is effective , because of its fast - acting mechanism  @xcite , it may also contribute to the significantly weaker cross - correlations at short time scales we find in healthy subjects compared to post - stroke subjects ( fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .",
    "however , the correlation due to the above mechanisms will decrease very fast when increasing the time lag @xmath82 between bp and bfv signals .",
    "thus , the correlations at long time scales ( @xmath19010 seconds ) observed for post - stroke subjects ( fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) , can not be attributed to the effect of cerebral autoregulation .",
    "instead , the existence of such strong and sustained cross - correlations may imply that bfv will passively follow the changes of bp , thus indicating absence of vascular dilation or constriction and impaired cerebral autoregulation for the post - stroke subjects .    to quantitatively distinguish the control group from the stroke group , we study the characteristics of the correlation function @xmath81 for all subjects . for each correlation function @xmath81",
    ", we first find @xmath179 , the maximal value of @xmath81 , which tells the strength of the correlation . then we choose a threshold value , e.g. , @xmath180 , search for the maximum of @xmath181 during each heart beat period along both positive and negative lags , and find two points in those maxima with largest time lags at which the correlation are still above @xmath183 .",
    "the average of absolute values of these two points gives the characteristic time lags @xmath184 . from @xmath184 and @xmath179 for all subjects and during all physiologic conditions , one can confirm that the stroke group tends to have larger @xmath179 and longer time lag @xmath184 compared to those for the control group .",
    "we apply manova to demonstrate whether @xmath184 and @xmath179 are different for healthy and post - stroke subjects .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "we find that during tilt and hyperventilation , the control and stroke groups are not significantly different ( p values @xmath191 ) . in contrast , during supine rest and co@xmath0 re - breathing , the difference between the control group and the stroke group becomes significant ( p values @xmath192 ) .",
    "to explain the above difference in @xmath184 and @xmath179 during supine rest , we note that post - stroke subjects exhibit higher bp and co@xmath0 mean values in baseline ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the bp - bfv autoregulatory curve for post - stroke subjects is shifted to the right , to higher bp values , while at the same time the plateau of this curve is narrowed due to the higher level of co@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "co@xmath0 rebreathing increases the level of the co@xmath0 after the period of hyperventilation ( hypocapnia ) , thus further testing the reactivity of the ca which shows impaired vasodilatatory responses in post - stroke subjects .",
    "in contrast , vasoconstrictor responses to tilt - up hyperventilation are preserved .",
    "in this study we investigate dynamics of cerebral autoregulation from the relationship between the peripheral bp in the finger and the cerebral bfv for a group of healthy and post - stroke subjects during the four different physiologic conditions of supine , tilt , hyperventilation , co@xmath0 rebreathing . the mechanism of cerebral autoregulation is traditionally accessed through the response of the average cerebral bfv to abrupt perturbation in the the average bp ( e.g. , upright tilt from supine position ) , and is typically characterized by the ability of the cerebral blood vessels to restore equilibrium and a steady cerebral blood flow after such perturbation  a process which is known to operate on time scales above several heartbeats .",
    "in contrast , we focus on the dynamical characteristics of the pressure - flow fluctuation around average values .",
    "we show that in healthy subjects the ca mechanism is active even during the steady equilibrium state .",
    "moreover , we find that on top of the bfv waveforms associated each heartbeat there are robust fluctuations which are reduced in the post - stroke subjects , indicating an active cerebral vascular regulation in healthy subjects on time scales within a single heartbeat even under steady bp .    to test for the dynamical patterns in the bp - bfv fluctuations we use four different methods , and we compare the results of the analyses by evaluating the combined effects of pressure autoregulation ( upright tilt ) and metabolic autoregulation ( hyperventilation and co@xmath0 rebreathing ) in healthy and post - stroke subjects .",
    "we find that the gain and phase obtained from the traditional transfer function analysis do not provide a significant difference between healthy and post - stroke subjects .",
    "in contrast , the coherence is significantly different in the heartbeat frequency range ( 0.7 - 1.4 hz ) when we compare both the normal side and the stroke side of post - stroke subjects with healthy subjects .",
    "further , we find that the amplitude of the direct cross - correlation between the bp and bfv signals does not separate the control from the stroke group and between different physiologic conditions when we compare the normal side of post - stroke subjects with healthy subjects .",
    "however , comparing the stroke side of post - stroke subjects with healthy subjects , we find a statistically significant difference , suggesting that direct cross - correlation method is sensitive to detect abnormalities in ca only for the stroke side .",
    "in addition , we observe a significantly faster decay in the bp - bfv cross - correlation function for healthy subjects , reflecting higher beat - to - beat variability in the bp and bfv signals , compared to post - stroke subjects .    since both bp and bfv are driven by the heartbeat , we also test the coupling between these two signals applying the phase synchronization method . for healthy subjects",
    "we observe a weaker synchronization between bp and bfv characterized by lower value of the synchronization index @xmath106 compared to post - stroke subjects , indicating that the ca mechanism modulates the cerebral bfv waves so that they are not completely synchronized with peripheral bp waves driven by the heartbeat .",
    "we find a significantly stronger bp - bfv synchronization in post - stroke subjects associated with loss of cerebral autoregulation .    to probe how the ca mechanism modulates the bfv we investigate the dynamical patterns in the instantaneous phase increments of the bp signals @xmath193 and compare them with the patterns we find in the instantaneous phase increments of the bfv signals @xmath194 .",
    "remarkably , we find that for post - stroke subjects @xmath193 and @xmath194 exhibit practically identical patterns in time , leading to very high degree of cross - correlation between @xmath193 and @xmath195 .",
    "in contrast , for healthy subjects @xmath195 exhibits robust random fluctuations very different from the structured oscillatory patterns we find in @xmath196 .",
    "this leads to a significantly reduced cross - correlation between @xmath193 and @xmath195 for healthy subjects compared to post - stroke subjects .",
    "our results indicate a statistically significant separation between the stroke and the control group when we compare both the normal and the stroke side in post - stroke subjects with healthy subjects .",
    "this suggests that our new approach based on cross - correlation of the instantaneous phase increments of bp and bfv is sensitive to detect impairment of cerebral vascular autoregulation in both hemispheres for subjects with minor ischemic stroke .",
    "our findings of robust fluctuations in @xmath194 , which do not synchronize with periodic patterns in @xmath193 , clearly indicate that the mechanism of cerebral autoregulation impacts the dynamics not only on scales above several heartbeats but is also active within a single heartbeat , i.e. , much shorter time scales than previous known .",
    "since these fluctuations are present in the data after we have truncated the a part of bp and bfv signals corresponding to the initial perturbation related to changes in the physiologic condition , our results also suggest that the cerebral autoregulation plays an important role even in the quasi - steady state .",
