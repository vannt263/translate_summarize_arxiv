    "large and stably large subalgebras were introduced in  @xcite as an abstraction of putnam s orbit breaking subalgebra of the crossed product @xmath5 of the cantor set by a minimal homeomorphism . in this paper , we define a stronger concept , that of a centrally large subalgebra .",
    "large orbit breaking subalgebras are also centrally large , and centrally large subalgebras provide more information about the containing algebra . we prove ( theorem  [ tsr1goesupextralarge ] ) that if @xmath0 is a simple unital c*-algebra and @xmath6 is a large subalgebra which has stable rank one , then @xmath0 also has stable rank one .",
    "if in addition @xmath7 has real rank zero , we prove ( theorem  [ t_4y11_rrz ] ) that @xmath0 also has real rank zero .",
    "we use our result to prove the following result ( theorem  [ t_5413_tsrcp ] ) for crossed products by minimal homeomorphisms .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact metric space which has a surjective continuous map to the cantor set , and let @xmath2 be a minimal homeomorphism .",
    "then @xmath3 has stable rank one .",
    "this result holds regardless of the dimension of  @xmath1 or the mean dimension of  @xmath4 .",
    "it is expected that @xmath3 is classifiable in terms of the elliott invariant if and only if @xmath4 has mean dimension zero , and one direction is the main result of  @xcite .",
    "thus our result shows that crossed products by minimal homeomorphisms can have stable rank one even when they are not expected to be classifiable .",
    "the examples of  @xcite confirm that this happens : they do not have mean dimension zero , their crossed products are not stable under tensoring with the jiang - su algebra , but our theorem shows that the crossed products do have stable rank one .    in  @xcite",
    ", we will use our result to prove a generalization of theorem  [ t_5413_tsrcp ] .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact metric space with a free minimal action of  @xmath8 .",
    "assume @xmath9 has a factor system which is a free minimal action of  @xmath8 on the cantor set .",
    "then @xmath10 has stable rank one .",
    "again , no hypothesis on mean dimension is needed .",
    "we do not include the proof here because the proof of the existence of the necessary centrally large subalgebra is somewhat involved .",
    "we point out , however , that the main reason for the abstraction of putnam s construction is to be able to handle situations of this sort , in which there appears to be no explicit construction of the necessary subalgebra , only an existence proof .",
    "we give the motivation and background in more detail .",
    "let @xmath1 be an infinite compact metric space , let @xmath2 be a homeomorphism , and let @xmath11 be closed .",
    "let @xmath12 be the standard unitary .",
    "the @xmath13-orbit breaking subalgebra is the subalgebra @xmath14 of @xmath3 generated by @xmath15 and all elements @xmath16 for @xmath17 such that @xmath18 .",
    "( putnam actually used @xmath19 rather than @xmath16 , but our choice makes the relationship with rokhlin towers less awkward . ) if @xmath4 is minimal , @xmath1 is infinite , and @xmath13 meets each orbit of  @xmath4 at most once , then @xmath14 is large in @xmath3 ( theorem  7.10 of  @xcite ) .",
    "subalgebras with properties similar to this one have been used in many other places , such as the study of crossed products of the cantor set by free minimal actions of @xmath8 ( @xcite , but without the name ) , the recent proof by elliott and niu that if @xmath2 is minimal and has mean dimension zero , then @xmath3 is @xmath20-stable  @xcite , and the proof that `` breaking '' the generating unitaries in an irrational rotation algebra gives an af  algebra  @xcite .",
    "see the introduction to  @xcite for a much longer list of applications .    for an infinite dimensional simple unital c*-algebra  @xmath0 and a stably large subalgebra @xmath6 ,",
    "the following results were proved in  @xcite :    * @xmath7 is simple ( proposition  5.2 of  @xcite ) and infinite dimensional ( proposition  5.5 of  @xcite ) . * if @xmath7 is stably finite then so is  @xmath0 ( corollary  6.16 of  @xcite ) , and if @xmath7 is purely infinite then so is  @xmath0 ( proposition  6.17 of  @xcite ) .",
    "* the restriction maps @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( on tracial states and quasitraces ) are bijective ( theorem  6.2 of  @xcite and proposition  6.9 of  @xcite ) .",
    "* when @xmath0 is stably finite , the inclusion of @xmath7 in @xmath0 induces an isomorphism on the semigroups that remain after deleting from @xmath23 and @xmath24 all the classes of nonzero projections ( theorem  6.8 of  @xcite ) . * @xmath7 and @xmath0 have the same radius of comparison ( theorem  6.14 of  @xcite ) .",
    "however , for several further results , such as ones involving stable rank one and @xmath20-stability , one seems to need a stronger condition : @xmath7 must be what we call centrally large in  @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we define centrally large subalgebras .",
    "we prove that a large subalgebra of crossed product type ( definition  [ d-2717cptype ] below ; definition  4.9 of  @xcite ) is in fact centrally large ; this result covers most of the examples which have appeared in applications .",
    "we then prove that if @xmath7 is centrally large in  @xmath0 and @xmath7 has stable rank one , then so does  @xmath0 .",
    "we will consider @xmath20-stability elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "for the application to the stable rank of crossed products , let @xmath2 be as above , and assume that @xmath1 has a surjective continuous map to the cantor set .",
    "( the giol - kerr examples  @xcite have this property , because the have the universal odometer as a factor .",
    ") then @xmath13 as above can be chosen to be a decreasing intersection of compact open subsets of  @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", it is known that @xmath14 is the direct limit of an ah  system which has diagonal maps in the sense of  @xcite .",
    "moreover ( by  @xcite ) , a simple direct limit of an ah  system with diagonal maps has stable rank one , even with no assumptions on the dimension growth in the system .",
    "we conjecture , jointly with zhuang niu , that @xmath3 has stable rank one for a completely arbitrary minimal homeomorphism  @xmath4 of an infinite compact metric space  @xmath1 .",
    "the original main application was to prove that of @xmath1 is a finite dimensional compact metric space , and if @xmath8 acts freely and minimally on  @xmath1 , then @xmath25 has stable rank one , using the large subalgebra of crossed product type constructed in  @xcite .",
    "this particular application has been superseded before its publication in two different ways .",
    "first , using centrally large subalgebras , one can in fact prove @xmath20-stability , which by theorem  6.7 of  @xcite implies stable rank one .",
    "second , @xmath20-stability ( in fact , finite nuclear dimension ) has also been obtained by different methods in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
