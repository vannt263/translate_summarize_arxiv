    "recent high precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy power spectrum @xcite have confirmed inflation @xcite as the dominant paradigm to explain the origin of primordial fluctuations with a nearly scale - invariant spectrum . in addition",
    "to density perturbations , inflationary models predict a stochastic background of gravitational waves @xcite with the amplitude of the gravitational wave background given by the height of the inflaton potential when relevant modes exit the horizon .",
    "inflationary gravitational waves with wavelengths comparable to the horizon size are now being sought via ground - based cmb polarization experiments @xcite , and eventually with a dedicated satellite generally named cmbpol @xcite .",
    "in addition to the cmb effort , concept studies are now underway to investigate the possibility of directly detecting the relic background with a laser interferometer in space ( big bang observer @xcite ; for the decigo proposal in japan , see ref .",
    "the direct detection technique will be sensitive to modes with wavelengths roughly an arm length of the interferometer . based on the expected foreground confusion and technological improvements ,",
    "current concept studies aim for the frequency regime between 0.1 hz to a few hz .",
    "since physical scales probed by the cmb and laser interferometers differ by @xmath017 orders of magnitude in wavelength , the large lever arm produced by combining the two techniques allows the inflaton potential to be pinned down better than any single method @xcite .    here , we consider two separate studies on inflation using the combined information from cmb and direct detection experiments .",
    "first , based on a monte carlo description of the inflationary dynamics , we study the relative abilities of the cmb and a direct detection method to probe the inflaton potential in detail by making no assumptions on the power - law behavior @xcite or on a model shape for the potential @xcite .",
    "we first consider inflationary models allowed by cmb data , making use of constraints on both the scalar and tensor spectrum , and address if laser interferometers can further improve the identification of potentials . for the cmb , we make use of the expected level of uncertainty with planck , a possible detection with cmbpol , and the foreground - limit from cmbpol . for details on the potential detectability of the tensor amplitude with cmb polarization observations ,",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite . for the direct detection experiments , we make use of predictions related to bbo and decigo @xcite . since our goal is to see how the simplest models of inflation can be constrained , our comparisons are for a general single - field potential in the slow - roll regime .    in the second part of the paper ,",
    "we drop all assumptions related to single - field slow - roll inflation and study how well the cmb and the direct detection experiments can be combined to constrain the single - field consistency relation between tensor spectral index and the ratio of tensor - to - scalar amplitudes for single - field inflationary models .",
    "previous work on this possibility is found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the test was limited to simply the information on the tensor spectral index from cmb data alone .",
    "we show the extent to which a cmb - only analysis can be improved by adding direct - detection information as the latter allows a better determination of the tensor spectral index .    this paper is organized as follows : in the next section",
    ", we present the monte carlo modeling of the inflationary potential that satisfy both detections or limits at cmb and laser interferometer scales . in section  iii , we discuss a fundamental test of single - field slow - roll inflation , involving the consistency relation between tensor - to - scalar ratio and the tensor spectral index .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary of our results in section  iv .",
    "to calculate observable spectra , we make use of a monte carlo technique to formulate the inflationary dynamics through an infinite hierarchy of flow equations involving the generalized `` hubble slow roll '' ( hsr ) parameters @xcite .",
    "we link the hubble parameter directly to the field @xmath1 instead of time , @xmath2 , under the assumption that @xmath1 is monotonic in time .",

    ", one has to truncate the infinite hierarchy at some finite order ; in this paper we retain terms up to 10th order . truncating",
    "the hierarchy of flow parameters at the term @xmath8 means that @xmath9 at all times as well . from eq .",
    "[ eq : hier ] , it also follows that @xmath10 at all times .",

    "these slow roll parameters require a prior assumption on the ranges of values taken . in the absence of any",
    "_ a priori _ theoretical knowledge , one can assume flat priors with the requirement that the potential satisfies the slow - roll condition ; the latter is simply a statement about the smoothness of the potential . since we are not attempting to make any statements about the measure of inflationary trajectories , but simply use the method as a monte carlo generator for potentials satisfying the slow roll conditions , such an assumption is justified .",
    "this work does not depend on the density of potentials as a function of tensor - to - scalar ratio , which is determined by the measure on the initial conditions .            without loss of generality",
    ", we can pick some fiducial physical scale that corresponds to @xmath20 , which we take to be at @xmath21 mpc@xmath22 . then , with the above convention , @xmath23 corresponds to scales larger than @xmath24 ( i.e. going further back in time ) , and @xmath25 corresponds to smaller scales . the physical wavenumber is associated with a value of @xmath1 through @xmath26 while the number of e - folds before the end of inflation , @xmath27 , comes from @xmath28 , with the convention that @xmath27 increases as one goes further back in time . here , we require that each potential generated by the monte carlo flows provide at least @xmath29 e - folds of inflation . for potentials where inflation ends through the breakdown of slow - roll , the cmb observables are calculated at 55 e - folds before the end of inflation ; for potentials corresponding to the hybrid case , the cmb observables are arbitrarily calculated at the 600th e - fold , assuming inflation ends at 655 e - folds through an orthogonal mechanism .",

    "we show all potentials with @xmath48 , though in practice the cmb measurements will also yield strong constraints on this parameter . in fig .",
    "1 we also show the improvement in constraints on the potential using information from direct detection experiments with uncertainties in the tensor amplitude and tilt calculated following results of the analysis in ref .  @xcite .    in fig .  1 , the potentials generated by the monte - carlo process are color - coded in the following way",
    "first , all potentials with @xmath48 which are _ not _ ruled out by applying the constraints on @xmath32 from the cmb experiment are shown in red .",
    "then the potentials which are _ not _ ruled out by further applying the @xmath49 constraint from the cmb experiment are over - plotted in blue .",
    "next , the potentials which are _ not _ eliminated by adding the constraint from bbo - standard on the tensor amplitude and tilt to the cmb experiment are over - plotted in green . finally , the potentials which are _ not _ eliminated by adding the constraints from either bbo - grand ( left , centre ) or decigo ( right ) to the cmb experiment are over - plotted in black . at each stage ,",
    "the elimination of a larger fraction of potentials indicates the usefulness of the extra constraints .",
    "if a particular color does not appear in a given panel , it means that all potentials have been overwritten by the next tightest constraint , and therefore the next tightest constraint does not aid in constraining the potential .",
    "therefore , while the combination of planck and bbo - standard , and especially bbo - grand , leads to an improvement in constraints on the potential , these direct detection experiments do not compete at all with cmbpol either in the case of a detection at @xmath50 or the limit of @xmath51 at cmb scales .",
    "a more sensitive experiment such as decigo probing @xmath52 competes well with cmbpol if @xmath53 and is both desirable and useful to understand inflation .",
    "to further understand the usefulness of a direct detection experiment , we also study how well the inflationary single - field consistency condition can be tested @xcite , as any departure can capture important physics @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath54 so that @xmath55 corresponds to the consistency relation .",
    "the uncertainty in determining @xmath56 ( given @xmath55 as the fiducial value ) can be written in terms of uncertainty in measurements of @xmath32 and @xmath33 assuming these are uncorrelated , @xmath57^{1/2 } r^{-1}. \\label{eq : consistency_error}\\ ] ] a 10% determination of @xmath56 with the expected value of unity requires measuring @xmath33 with an uncertainty of @xmath58 . using tables of ref .",
    "@xcite , cmbpol with a 10% foreground contamination and @xmath59 gives @xmath60 .",
    "the obstacle is the inability of cmb polarization observations to measure @xmath33 precisely , since polarization anisotropies probe a limited range in the underlying tensor spectrum modes , and the range probed is also contaminated by cosmic shear @xcite .",
    "when combining with a direct detection experiment , however , the situation improves significantly .",
    "we calculate the 1@xmath61 error expected in @xmath56 at cmb scales based on a determination of @xmath33 from direct detection scales and a determination of @xmath32 by cmbpol . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that a laser interferometer ( whose sensitivity peaks at @xmath62 hz ) would be able to determine the spectral tilt of a gravitational wave background , with an amplitude @xmath63 , to an accuracy of @xmath64 where the various values of @xmath46 corresponding bbo - standard , bbo - grand and decigo are shown in fig .  2 and @xmath65 is the hubble parameter today in units of @xmath66 .",
    "while we take our fiducial model to be single - field slow -roll inflation ( i.e. @xmath67 ) , we make no assumptions about single - field slow - roll inflation when we relate @xmath68 to the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "first we relate @xmath69 to the primordial spectrum as in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the primordial power spectrum of inflationary gravitational waves , and @xmath72 .",
    "the factor , @xmath73 , takes into account how the gravitational waves have evolved after re - entering the horizon .",
    "the primordial inflationary gravitational wave power spectrum can be approximated as a power law with a running spectral index , @xmath74 using the expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hsrconversionsstart]-[eq : nt ] ) to first order in the slow roll parameters along with the expression for the running of the tensor spectral index , @xmath75 , @xmath76 we are able to express @xmath33 and @xmath75 in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath31 , @xmath77 } , \\label{eq : pt}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the amplitude of the scalar perturbations at some pivot wavenumber @xmath79 and all of the spectral quantities are also measured at this wavenumber . for this analysis",
    "we take @xmath80 and @xmath81 at @xmath82 @xcite .    since we must connect a measurement of @xmath33 at bbo scales to the @xmath33 at cmb scales in order to determine @xmath56 , we must posit some scale - dependent relation between these two measurements .",
    "we emphasize that we _ can not _ use the flow equation approach of the previous section here ; those equations assume single - field inflation and therefore implicitly embody the consistency relation , whereas here we are attempting to _ test _ the single - field assumption .",
    "instead , we assume that the gravitational wave spectrum is close to scale invariant with an unknown , but higher order , running so that @xmath83 . since the running of @xmath33 is unlikely to be determined by either the cmb or direct detection we include an additional uncertainty due to the unknown running , @xmath84 , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : running ] ) .",
    "this leads to a decrease in the sensitivity of direct detection measurements of @xmath56 at ` large ' values of @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , the error on our determination of @xmath33 is given by the expression , @xmath85 ^ 2 + \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{dir}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cmb}}}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{r}{8}\\right)^2\\right]^2\\bigg\\}^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    our results are summarized in fig .  2 .",
    "the left panel shows the mapping between tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath32 at cmb scales and @xmath86 at 1 hz for a direct detection .",
    "after this paper appeared in preprint , another study @xcite was submitted , where a criticism was made of a region on this panel , describing it as unphysical .",
    "in fact this region is _ only _ unphysical if inflation is being assumed as the generating mechanism for tensor modes , and one can not do that if one is attempting , as we are , to test that assumption in the first place .",
    "therefore we continue to show this region , while indicating that it is unphysical under the assumption of inflation . as shown in the right panel",
    ", bbo improves relative to cmbpol alone by a factor of @xmath0 a few in the uncertainty of @xmath56 if @xmath87 .",
    "this is unlikely to be useful given that current observations already limit @xmath32 to be below 0.3 .",
    "a determination of @xmath56 as @xmath88 is achievable when @xmath89 with decigo , while if @xmath90 , it is unlikely that even decigo would provide a determination of @xmath56 to a reasonable accuracy . in general ,",
    "either version of bbo is unlikely to be competitive with cmbpol , and the sensitivity level of decigo must be considered as the experimental target goal to pursue a direct detection at @xmath0 1 hz . further limits on @xmath32 from the cmb will tighten this conclusion and could only lead to a further increase in required sensitivity unless a detection is made with the cmb at @xmath91 .",
    "our conclusions are independent of the choice of a fiducial frequency between 0.1 hz and few hz , but could be subjected to the highly uncertain impact of foregrounds at direct detection frequencies @xcite .",
    "additional physics between the cmb and 1 hz scales @xcite only strengthen our conclusions on the required sensitivity for a laser interferometer as these exotic models generally lower the tensor amplitude further .",
    "to summarize , we have considered the relative strengths of cmb polarization observations and direct detection laser interferometers in constraining the inflaton potential . for single - field slow - roll inflation models , without relying on any particular shape for the potential",
    ", we find that direct detection experiments with sensitivities around bbo can improve constraints on inflationary models relative to planck .",
    "however , when combined with cmbpol , these direct detection sensitivities are unlikely to be competitive .",
    "while we have not considered exotic models , and a case can certainly be made for a low - sensitivity direct detection experiment based on non - standard descriptions for inflation including models of bubble nucleation @xcite and pre - big bang descriptions @xcite , it is also important to understand first how these experiments test the simplest forms of inflation .    in this context , we also discuss a determination of the single - field slow - roll consistency relation , which is a way to establish an underlying model within the inflationary paradigm to probe physics at the earliest times of the universe . in general , we find an experiment like decigo , with sensitivity level of @xmath52 to be the preferred option ; however , it is unlikely that the consistency relation will be determined to the accuracy needed to see loop corrections @xcite , unless the tensor - to - scalar ratio is greater than 0.05 and loop corrections are at the level of 10% or more .",
