    "spectral and timing properties of astronomical sources of very high - energy s could be strongly affected by the development of electromagnetic cascades on the way from the source to the earth .",
    "these cascades could be initiated by interactions of the s with the ambient radiation fields inside the  source , in the source host galaxy and in the milky way galaxy , as well as with cosmological photon fields in the intergalactic space .",
    "the ubiquity of particle cascades has two - fold consequences .",
    "on one , pessimistic , side , they complicate the interpretation of the observational data in the very - high - energy ( vhe , 0.1 - 10  tev ) @xmath2-ray band . on the other , optimistic , side , with enough spectral and angular resolution , one can quantify the influence of the cascade on the observed source signal and not only reconstruct the spectrum of the primary @xmath2-ray source , but also use the information about properties of the cascade to study the physical characteristics of the medium in which the cascade has developed .",
    "an illustration of such possibility is given by the observations of the effect of absorption of vhe @xmath2-rays on the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "observations of this effect in the spectra of distant blazars are now routinely used to constrain the ebl spectrum and , in this way , the models of cosmological evolution of galaxies and stellar populations ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .    in the derivation of the constraints on the ebl from the observations of absorption of vhe @xmath2-ray flux from distant blazars one",
    "usually adopts an assumption that secondary emission from the @xmath3 pairs , deposited in the intergalactic space by the absorbed @xmath2-rays , is not detectable .",
    "this assumption is valid if the trajectories of the secondary pairs are significantly deflected by the magnetic fields during their radiative cooling .",
    "this is true if the strength of the extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmf ) is higher than @xmath4  g @xcite .",
    "however , the strength of egmf is not measured ( see @xcite for a review of measurements of cosmic magnetic fields ) , so that there is no direct way to check the validity of the the assumption of the non - detection of the cascade emission .",
    "it is also not possible to constrain the values of egmf from the cosmological models of the origin of magnetic fields in the universe .",
    "the problem of the origin of @xmath5 g magnetic fields in galaxies and galaxy clusters is one of the long standing problems of astrophysics / cosmology  ( see @xcite for reviews ) . on the galaxy scales , such fields",
    "are thought to be produced via dynamo mechanism @xcite from `` seed '' primordial fields of unknown origin .",
    "recent observations of the presence of strong , @xmath6 g , magnetic fields in the high - redshift galaxies @xcite point to the fact that the dynamo mechanism is extremely efficient and/or the seed magnetic fields are quite strong so that the 10  @xmath7 g magnetic fields are generated already at large redshifts .",
    "the dynamo mechanism could work also on the scales of galaxy clusters @xcite , although the seed magnetic fields would be amplified by a much smaller factor in this case .",
    "the fact that the observed strength of magnetic field in galaxy clusters is comparable to that of the individual galaxies @xcite implies that the seed fields in the galaxy clusters should be orders of magnitude higher than the seed magnetic fields for the galactic dynamos .",
    "recent simulations show that such stronger seed magnetic fields could be produced via magnetized winds from the cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "the origin of the seed magnetic fields for the galactic dynamos is largely uncertain .",
    "all the models of production of such seed fields invoke the difference of mobility of electrons and protons , which results in production of electric currents and of the `` battery - like '' effects at different stages of cosmological evolution , from the phase transitions in the early universe , to the formation of first galaxies @xcite .",
    "a common feature of all the theoretical models is a prediction that a larger or smaller fraction of the space outside galaxies , galaxy clusters and filaments of the large scale structure has to be filled with very weak magnetic field , with the strength approaching that of the primordial seed fields . depending on the model , the predictions of the typical strength of the egmf in the voids of the large scale structure range from @xmath8  g up to @xmath9  g ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moderate observational limit on the present day strength of egmf @xmath10 g comes from the limit on rotation measure of emission from distant quasars  @xcite .",
    "similar restriction comes from the analysis of anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray observations could , in principle , be used to constrain properties of the egmf using the imaging @xcite and/or timing @xcite of the  signal .",
    "the idea is to observe or , at least , constrain the properties of the inverse compton ( ic ) emission produced by the @xmath3 pairs deposited by the absorbed s in the intergalactic space .",
    "if the egmf strength is below @xmath1  g ( plausible assumption , in the view of the cosmological models of the origin of magnetic fields ) , one expects that the deflections of the secondary electrons and positrons by egmf should result in the appearance of an egmf - dependent extended emission around initially point sources and/or in an egmf - dependent time delay of the emission from the secondary pairs . if the egmf is stronger than @xmath1  g , vhe @xmath2-ray observations still can be used to derive a _ lower _",
    "limit on the egmf strength , because strong egmf @xmath11  g can still be revealed via the extended emission around vhe sources @xcite with properties not directly dependent on the egmf structure .    in what follows",

    "although useful for the qualitative understanding of the method of measurement of egmf , these assumptions do not hold in realistic situation . in a more general case ,",
    "the shape of the radial surface brightness profile of extended source , @xmath131 , could be derived from the results of our numerical calculations .    in the particular case of a powerlaw primary  spectrum with the photon index @xmath78 , which we consider as an example , the radial brightness profiles of extended source shown in fig .",

    "this is reflected in a large errorbar of the point at @xmath120  g in fig .",

    "obvious ways to extend the range of accessible egmf strengths toward still weaker fields is to improve the angular resolution and/or to extend the observed energy band to the energies below 0.1  tev .",

    "the measurement of @xmath148 is still partially possible at the energies much larger than @xmath123  tev , but the precision of determination of @xmath148 rapidly drops when the field becomes larger than @xmath150  g. one should note that , in a realistic situation , the measurement of the radial brightness profile of extended source becomes problematic already when the source size is smaller , but comparable to the size of the field of view .",
    "the difficulty is that the source signal has to be disentangled from the cosmic ray background , in the camera , with intensity depends on the off - axis angle .    in our calculations",
    "we have ignored these difficulties and assumed that ( a ) the telescope fov is not limited and ( b ) that an arbitrary large source ( with extension up to @xmath151 ) could be detected .",
    "one can see that with a large fov , high sensitivity telescope the field strength can be reconstructed from the measurement of characteristics of the extended emission up to the egmf strengths @xmath4  g , at which the energy dependence of the source size on egmf gets lost because of the too strong deflections of the cascade electrons and positrons .    in principle , an energy - dependent size of the extended source is predicted also when the strength of egmf is larger than @xmath1  g , within the model of extended emission discussed in the ref .",
    "however , in this case the size of the source is determined by the mean free path of the 10 - 100  tev s through the cosmological infrared / optical background .",

    "the primary source spectrum is ( a ) not known in advance and ( b ) is strongly modified at the highest energies by the effect of absorption on the ebl .",

    "the dependence of the properties of the cascades on the egmf strength could be used to reveal the presence of extremely weak magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium and to measure ( or , at least , estimate ) the strength of these fields .",
