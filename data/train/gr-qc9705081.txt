    "in recent years , our understanding of pulsations of non - rotating relativistic stars has been much improved . in particular , the role of gravitational wave in the stars becomes much clear .",
    "there exists the oscillation mode named as w - mode ( gravitational _ w_ave mode ) , associated with the gravitational wave .",
    "the gravitational wave is inherent in the general relativity , so that the mode becomes evident only for relativistic system . except for this new mode ,",
    "the relativity little affects the modes known in the newtonian pulsation theory .",
    "the general relativity slightly changes the oscillation frequency and gives rise to a very slow damping of the mode .",
    "the emission of gravitational radiation implies that the oscillation frequency should be complex with a relatively tiny imaginary part .",
    "( see andersson , kojima , and kokkotas and references therein for the present status of the oscillation spectra of non - rotating relativistic stars . )",
    "the perturbation of the gravity is not so important , if the w - mode and the decay of the pulsations due to the gravitational radiation do not matter .",
    "this fact hints at the further simplification of the pulsation problem , that is , neglecting the perturbation of the gravitational field .",
    "this approximation is known as the cowling approximation ( cowling ) in the newtonian stellar pulsation theory , and gives the same qualitative results and reasonable accuracy of the oscillation frequencies .",
    "( see , e.g. , cox . ) two different prescriptions , so far , had been proposed for the relativistic cowling approximation in non - radial pulsations of the non - rotating stars .",
    "one method is that all metric perturbations are neglected , i.e. , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the other is that the @xmath2 component of the metric perturbations is retained in the pulsation equations @xcite .",
    "lindblom and splinter examined the accuracy of these two versions of the approximation for the dipole p - modes , and concluded that the mcdermott , van horn , and scholl version is more accurate than finn s version .",
    "however , the finn s version is superior in g - mode calculations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the oscillations in the non - rotating stars , the calculation of oscillation frequencies in rapidly rotating relativistic stars seems to be very difficult task .",
    "the equations become significantly complicated due to the relativity and rotation .",
    "see priou for a set of the explicitly written , lengthy equations .",
    "therefore , the calculation of normal frequencies was limited to the non - rotating and slowly rotating stars at best @xcite .",
    "the possibility to use the cowling approximation in rotating relativistic system should be studied .",
    "ipser and lindblom formulated the cowling approximation of the relativistic system , setting the metric perturbation to zero .",
    "if the approximation is applied to the stellar pulsation , the equation becomes single second order partial differential equation .",
    "the equation is manageable and will be hopefully solved in the future .",
    "the crucial point is how good the cowling approximation is to estimate the oscillation frequency in the relativistic regime .    in this paper",
    ", we will estimate the accuracy of the cowling approximation in the frequencies of the non - rotating star and its rotational corrections .",
    "that is , we will compare the frequencies of the cowling approximation with those of the relativistic perturbation theory . in section 2 , we present the formalism to calculate normal frequencies and the rotational shifts by the the cowling approximation . in section 3 , the comparison between both numerical results is given .",
    "finally , section 4 is devoted to the discussion . throughout this paper",
    "we will use units of @xmath3 .",
    "to assess the accuracy of the cowling approximation , two distinct calculations are performed . in one calculation , the relativistic perturbation equations are solved to find normal frequencies and the rotational corrections for the pulsation of stellar models .",
    "the equations and techniques are described in kojima ( 1992,1993 ) . in the other calculation",
    ", we adopt the relativistic cowling approximation .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the slowly rotating case , and write down the equations of the pulsation and rotational corrections below .",
    "normal frequencies are real numbers , because gravitational perturbations are neglected in the cowling approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "the normal frequencies are complex numbers with small imaginary part representing the damping of the gravitational radiation , when solving the exact pulsation equations .",
    "we make a comparison in the oscillation frequency only .",
    "we assume that the star is slowly rotating with a uniform angular velocity @xmath4 . in this paper",
    "we consider only the first order effect with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the radius and the mass of the star , respectively .",
    "the geometry of a slowly rotating star in general relativity is described by @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are functions of @xmath12 only .",
    "given an equation of state @xmath13 the construction of the slowly rotating equilibrium model is well - known .",
    "( for details see , e.g. , hartle ; chandrasekhar and miller . )",
    "we will assume a polytropic equation of state , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants .",
    "the function @xmath17 is of order @xmath18 and the others , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the same as in the non - rotating case .      in this subsection , we will explicitly write down the pulsation equation for the slowly rotating stars up to the first order of @xmath23 , using the equations derived by ipser and lindblom . we consider only the adiabatic perturbation for the perfect fluid , and use the simplest model for the adiabatic index @xmath24 based on the structure of the equilibrium configuration , @xmath25 the frequencies of the all @xmath26-modes are therefore zero in this case .",
    "the perturbations are given in terms of @xmath27 , radial function @xmath28 , and spherical harmonics @xmath29 , where the azimuthal dependence of the spherical harmonics is @xmath30 in our convention .",
    "the oscillation frequency @xmath31 is the value measured in the inertial frame .",
    "corresponding to equations ( 16)(18 ) of ipser and lindblom , the eulerian changes in the pressure , the density , and the four - velocity are written up to the first order of @xmath23 as @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 \\ , y_{lm } \\ , e^{-i \\sigma t } \\ , \\label{def4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath36   \\ , e^{-i \\sigma t } \\ ,",

    "since the background geometry is spherically symmetric , the angular part can be separated into each @xmath40 mode .",
    "the basic equation to be solved becomes second order ordinary differential equation for @xmath41 .",
    "( see equation ( 38 ) of ipser and lindblom . )",
    "we have @xmath42 \\delta v =           m \\ , ( 2 \\sigma \\ , \\omega \\ , c - s ) \\ , \\delta v \\ , \\label{basiceq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 @xmath44 -      l(l+1 ) \\ , ( \\rho + p ) \\ , e^{(\\nu+\\lambda)/2 } \\ ,   \\label{basiceq3}\\ ] ] @xmath45 @xmath46 \\biggr ] \\",

    "we will solve the eigen - value problem , equation ( [ basiceq1 ] ) by standard perturbation method , that is , expand the potential @xmath41 and the frequency @xmath49 with respect to the small parameter @xmath23 as , @xmath50 @xmath51 the equation of order @xmath52 is for the non - rotating case , @xmath53          \\delta v_0 = 0 \\ , \\label{basiceq11}\\ ] ] and the equation of order @xmath54 is @xmath55          \\delta v_1 + 2 \\sigma_0 \\sigma_1 \\ , c \\ , \\delta v_0 = & &   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "note also that the correction ( [ defsigma1 ] ) can be determined from the eigen - function and eigen - value in the non - rotating case , i.e. , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to calculate @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    the frequency in the cowling approximation should be compared with the real part of eigen - frequency calculated by the exact pulsation equation .",
    "the frequency @xmath49 of the slowly rotating star can be parameterized as @xmath63 where @xmath64 the subscript @xmath6 means the real part of the exact normal frequency .",
    "we will compare results of two calculations in @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "as mentioned in the last subsection , we need eigen - frequency and eigen - function of the pulsations in the non - rotating stars .",
    "the method to solve equation ( [ basiceq11 ] ) is well - known and straightforward .",
    "we will briefly summarize the boundary conditions and the numerical method .    since the basic equation ( [ basiceq11 ] ) is a second order differential equation ,",
    "two boundary conditions should be given for @xmath61 at the center and the surface of the star .",
    "the boundary condition at the center is that the function @xmath61 should be regular near @xmath67 .",
    "this condition can be written by power series as @xmath68 at the surface , the lagrangian perturbation of pressure should be vanished , @xmath69 this condition can be written explicitly as @xmath70 we can numerically integrate the equation ( [ basiceq11 ] ) from the center with the condition ( [ bounarycondition1 ] ) , and from the surface with ( [ bounarycondition2 ] ) to the appropriate interior point . the eigen - value @xmath62 can be obtained as the consistent frequency so as to match functions smoothly at the point .",
    "we also numerically calculate the rotational correction of normal frequency @xmath59 , by @xmath62 and @xmath61 through the equation ( [ defsigma1 ] ) .    in order to check our numerical code for the relativistic cowling approximation , we calculated the fundamental normal mode frequencies having harmonic index @xmath71 in the range @xmath72 for the non - rotating stellar model used by ipser and lindblom .",
    "our results were in good agreement with their normal frequencies and the difference was of the order less than @xmath73 .",
    "we have calculated normal frequencies for a range of the stellar models with a polytropic equation of state ( [ eos ] ) .",
    "we adapt two different polytropic indices ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the compactness of the star ranges from @xmath75 to @xmath76 the oscillation frequencies and the rotational corrections are calculated for the f- , p@xmath77- , and p@xmath78-modes having harmonics index @xmath79 in the range @xmath80 the results for typical stellar models are shown in tables 14 .",
    "normal frequencies of the non - rotating stars and the rotational corrections are compared . since there is not so much difference in the polytropic index ,",
    "we hereafter concentrate in the model with @xmath81 .",
    "we show the normal frequencies and rotational corrections of the f - modes as a function of @xmath82 in fig.1 .",
    "the eigen - frequencies of the non - rotating star , @xmath83 are given in fig.1(a ) , and the rotational corrections @xmath84 are in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the results with the exact relativistic calculation are represented by the dashed line , and those with the cowling approximation are by the solid lines . figure 1(a ) shows that two results of the f - mode approach with the increase of @xmath82 , that is , the error monotonically decreases .",
    "for example , the relative error for @xmath85 f - mode in @xmath86 model is about @xmath87 in the magnitude , but it decreases to @xmath88 in @xmath89 model .",
    "the relativistic cowling approximation therefore gives better result in the f - mode calculation , as equilibrium model becomes more relativistic .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows that both results are always in good agreement on the rotational corrections .",
    "the relative error is always less than @xmath90 .",
    "next , we show results of the p@xmath77- and p@xmath78-modes in figs.2 and 3 , respectively . compared with the exact calculation ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath82 is similar in the oscillation frequencies and the rotational corrections .",
    "the relative error is almost constant in @xmath83 , but increases in @xmath84 with @xmath82 .",
    "the approximation for these p - modes becomes worse for the relativistic stars .",
    "however , the discrepancy is always within @xmath91 error .    from figs .",
    "13 , it is quite clear that the accuracy of the cowling approximation increases with the spherical harmonic index , @xmath71 .",
    "this feature is well - known in the newtonian cowling approximation .",
    "( see , e.g. cox . )",
    "the neglect of the gravitational perturbation is justified due to the averaging effect of the local fluctuations for high - order modes .",
    "the newtonian cowling approximation also becomes better with the increase of the radial node number .",
    "( see , e.g. , robe for numerical results of the newtonian cowling approximation . ) in the relativistic case , the accuracy also increases , but the behavior is a little complicated due to the additional parameter @xmath82 .",
    "in this paper , we have compared the relativistic cowling approximation with the perturbation calculation of general relativity .",
    "the accuracy of the cowling approximation is considerably good , concerning the normal frequencies in the non - rotating star and the first order rotational corrections .",
    "remarkable fact is that the relative error of the f - mode decreases with the relativistic factor , @xmath82 .",
    "the approximation is also better for larger radial node number and harmonic index @xmath92 , and greater central condensation , as in the newtonian pulsation theory .",
    "one of the important applications of the normal modes is to determine the critical angular velocity of the rotating stars .",
    "the maximum angular velocity is limited by the existence of the axisymmetric equilibrium state .",
    "the equilibrium state however suffers secular instability due to viscosity and/or gravitational radiation reaction ( grr ) .",
    "the instability sets in through @xmath93 ( viscous instability ) or @xmath94 ( grr instability ) , respectively ( e.g. , friedman and schutz ) .",
    "form the newtonian calculation , most significant contributions to the grr instability are the f - modes with @xmath95 .",
    "( see , e.g. , yoshida and eriguchi . )",
    "the present study shows that the relativistic cowling approximation is able to give a good prediction of the oscillation frequency within @xmath96 error for the f - modes with @xmath97 in the typical neutron stars , @xmath98 .",
    "the critical point is however not within the regime of the linear extrapolation from the non - rotating case , as suggested in the newtonian calculation .",
    "that is , the present results , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are not sufficient , and the higher order rotational corrections are necessary .",
    "therefore , solving normal frequency in rapidly rotating stars with the cowling approximation would be a good method to determine the critical angular velocity .",
