    "the present value of the cosmological constant @xcite is one of the most tantalizing features of the modern universe : experimental data provide evidence for an accelerating universe , while estimations of the vacuum energy yield indeed the planckian value , corresponding to @xmath2 times the observed numbers .",
    "this striking contradiction suggests one to look for a cancellation mechanism , able to reproduce the observed data .",
    "the main interesting proposals to interpret the presence of dark energy can be divided into two classes @xcite : those theories that make explicitly presence of matter and the other ones , which relay on modifications of the friedmann dynamics .",
    "+ in fact , the substitution of the ricci scalar @xmath3 with a function @xmath0 in the gravitational action , i.e. @xmath4 leads to the generalized einstein equations @xmath5 which can mimic , under suitable hypotheses , the presence of dark energy as due to geometrical contributions .",
    "the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 components of ( [ ein ] ) for the frw model can be found by varying ( [ fdr ] ) , expressed as a function of the lapse @xmath8 and the scale factor @xmath9 , with respect to these two objects , respectively , using the continuity equation @xmath10 , and then setting @xmath11 , in the finite - volume limit .",
    "the choice of an exponential lagrangian density @xcite offers the intriguing scenario in which , after modifying the friedmann dynamics , the presence of matter has to be hypothesized for the einsteinian limit to be recovered .",
    "furthermore , the taylor expansion of the exponential lagrangian density allow us to realize that the geometrical components contain a cosmological term too .",
    "an important feature of our model arises when taking a planckian value for the fundamental parameter of the theory ( as requested by the cancellation of the vacuum - energy density ) .",
    "in fact , as far as the universe leaves the planckian era and its curvature has a characteristic length much greater than the planckian one , then the corresponding exponential lagrangian is expandable in series , reproducing general relativity ( gr ) to a high degree of approximation . as a consequence of this natural einsteinian limit ( which is reached in the early history of the universe ) ,",
    "most of the thermal history of the universe is unaffected by the generalized theory , while the cosmological constant , responsible for the universe acceleration , is the only late - time effect .",
    "this model is not aimed at showing that the present universe acceleration is a consequence of non - einsteinian dynamics of the gravitational field , but at outlining how it can be recognized from a vacuum - energy cancellation .",
    "such a cancellation must take place in order to deal with an expandable lagrangian term and must concern the vacuum - energy density as far as we build up the geometrical action only by means of fundamental units .",
    "the indication from cosmic - microwave - background anisotropies suggests one that the most appropriate characterization for the universe thermo - dynamics be provided by an equation of state of the form @xmath12 @xcite , i.e. a cosmological term .",
    "the appearance of a non - zero cosmological constant indicates that @xmath13 , while the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action is a linear term in @xmath3 , with the same sign of the previous one . + to deal with @xmath0 as a series expansion , we would have , in principle , to fix an infinite number of coefficients @xcite .",
    "however , in what follows , we address the point of view that only one characteristic length fixes the dynamics .",
    "+ as a consequence of this point of view , we fix the explicit function @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are two constants available for the problem . comparing the first two terms that come from the expansion of such a function ( valid in the region @xmath17 ) , with the eh action plus a cosmological term ,",
    "i.e. @xmath18 , we can identify @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "as required , our gravitational lagrangian is fixed by one parameter only , which has to be provided by observational data .      to investigate the generalized frw dynamics for this model",
    ", we analyze the desitter regime , where a constant vacuum energy density is taken into account . to this end",
    ", we take a cosmic scale factor of the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are two constants . it is easy to recognize that , for such a choice , the ricci scalar rewrites @xmath24 ; hence , according to the equation of state of a cosmological constant , @xmath25 , the friedmann equation reads @xmath26 the expression above has the surprising feature that the energy density would acquire a negative sign , and , restating the usual friedmann relation , we get @xmath27 thus , when the expansion rate of the universe @xmath23 is much smaller then the cosmological constant @xmath28 , we get the usual friedmann relation between matter and geometry .",
    "but , though such a standard relation is apparently reproduced as a low - curvature approximation for @xmath29 , nevertheless its inconsistency shows up when ( [ qwert ] ) is restated as @xmath30 we see that , by the expression above , for positive values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the quantity @xmath33 has always to be greater than two , in clear contradiction with the hypothesis @xmath29 , at the ground of the derivation of ( [ qwert ] ) .",
    "though we are dealing with a surprising behavior , due to the negative ratio @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 , however this feature offers an intriguing scenario .",
    "in fact , we will apply relation ( [ 14 ] ) to treat the non - observability of the universe vacuum energy in connection with the present universe acceleration ] .",
    "( [ sopra ] ) admits a special vacuum solution ( @xmath36 ) , which corresponds to the relation @xmath37 . for the choice of a negative cosmological constant , @xmath38",
    ", the equation above provides @xmath39 thus we see that , in vacuum , our model has the peculiar feature of predicting a desitter evolution in correspondence to a negative @xmath28 value .",
    "however , it should be noted that , for this value of @xmath40 , the exponential lagrangian can not be expanded , and we deal with the full non - perturbative regime with respect to the einsteinian gravity .",
    "it is just the request to deal with an expandable lagrangian that leads us to deal with the case @xmath41 and to introduce an external matter field .",
    "the exponential term is expandable only if @xmath42 , but this would imply that the dynamics must contain a cosmological term much greater than the universe curvature , i.e. , an inconsistency which apparently prevents us from recovering the einstein limit . on the other hand , significant contributions from powers @xmath43 would be predicted in a regime where the expansion of the exponential term does not hold .",
    "the vacuum dynamics admits a desitter phase in correspondence with a certain negative value of @xmath28 and the additional presence of matter is observable only if its constant energy density and @xmath32 have opposite signs .",
    "furthermore , the vacuum solution lives in the non - einsteinian region ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the universal features of such a matter contribution and its constant value suggest one to identify it with the vacuum energy .",
    "moreover , the cancellation required to get @xmath29 is the natural scenario in which a relic dark energy can be recognized .",
    "the reason why the cancellation proposed between the @xmath28 term and the vacuum energy density provides the right order of magnitude of the dark - energy contribution can be recognized in the following fact . by the structure of our model",
    ", the relic constant energy density must be a factor @xmath44 smaller than the dominant contribution @xmath45 .",
    "thus if we take the vacuum energy density close to the planckian value , then the actual ratio @xmath46 is of order @xmath47 .",
    "such a quantity behaves like @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the present hubble radius of the universe .",
    "however , it must be remarked that such a consideration holds in the case @xmath32 and the vacuum energy density are the only contributions . if an additional physical matter field is added , then the relic dark energy contribution is simply constrained to be less than the factor @xmath46 of the vacuum energy .    0 a. clocchiatti et al , _ astrophys.j . _",
