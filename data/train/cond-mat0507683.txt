    "liquid crystal phases which are formed by highly anisotropic complex organic molecules have symmetries intermediate between those of isotropic liquid and crystals . the simplest of the liquid crystal phases that find application in many electro - optic devices are nematic ( n ) and smectic a ( sm a ) ones . in the nematic phase ,",
    "molecules tend to align along a preferred direction called director , breaking the rotational invariance of isotropic liquid ( i ) but not the translational invariance",
    ". partial breakdown of translational invariance along with breaking of rotational invariance introduces smectic phases where molecules are essentially confined in layers . in sm a phase molecules",
    "are aligned perpendicular to layers with no intralayer or interlayer correlation in positions of the center of mass of the molecules .",
    "the properties and relative stability of these phases are extremely sensitive to the details of molecular structure and the true nature of intermolecular interaction potential[1 ] .",
    "therefore , it is of interest for either computer simulation or theory to study the effect of molecular shape anisotropy and intermolecular potential on the liquid crystalline phase behaviour and properties .    because of the complex structure of the mesogenic molecules it is very difficult to know the exact nature of the interaction potential as a function of intermolecular separation and orientation .",
    "therefore , modeling of the intermolecular potential only with more physically relevant features become inevitable .",
    "the pair interaction potential model proposed by gay and berne ( gb)[2 ] is one such model that includes anisotropic attractive interactions along with short range repulsive interactions .",
    "it has now become a standard model to study liquid crystalline phases and has been widely used in the investigation of various phenomena through computer simulation[3 - 13 ] and also theoretically[14 - 18 ] .    in the gay - berne ( gb )",
    "pair potential model , the molecules are considered as ellipsoids of revolution about the principal axis of the molecule .",
    "the interaction potential between two such ellipsoidal molecules @xmath2 and @xmath3 depends on direction @xmath4 and on the magnitude of center - center vector @xmath5 and upon molecular axis vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "the parameter @xmath13 is a measure of shape anisotropy defined as @xmath14 with @xmath1 being the length - to - width ratio of the molecule.though @xmath1 measures the anisotropy of the repulsive core , it also determines the difference in the depth of the attractive well between the side - by - side and the cross configurations .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 determines the energy anisotropy defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the well - depth ratio for side - by - side and end - to - end configuration .",
    "the powers @xmath18 and @xmath19 entering in the energy functions are adjustable exponents determining the strength of interaction .",
    "the gb model contains four parameters @xmath20 that determine the anisotropy in the repulsive and attractive forces in addition to two parameters @xmath21 that scale the distance and energy , respectively .",
    "the choices for the values of these parameters are in no way unique and they can be varied to yield a wide range of anisotropic potential[3 ] .",
    "the most commonly used values of these parameters in the literature are @xmath22 . in their molecular dynamic simulation study for this set of parameters",
    "de miguel @xmath23[4 , 5 ] found three phases , namely , isotropic , nematic and smectic b. no sm a phase was found to be stable . however , existence of sm a phase has been reported for the set of parameters @xmath24[6 ] .",
    "recently the effect that changes in the well depth parameter @xmath17[7 , 15 ] and molecular elongation @xmath1[8 , 9 , 17 ] have upon the overall phase behaviour of the system has been investigated .",
    "it was found that with the increase in @xmath17 the sm b phase is favored at low density while the nematic phase becomes increasingly stable at lower temperature as @xmath17 is decreased .",
    "the variation of molecular elongation parameter @xmath1 has been found to have a significant effect .",
    "an island of sm a is found to appear in the phase diagram for elongations above @xmath25[9 ] .",
    "the range of sm a extends to both higher and lower temperatures as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "also the isotropic - nematic ( i - n)transition is seen to move to lower density ( and pressure ) at a given temperature with the increase in @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper we use the density functional theory ( dft ) to study the effect of the variation of the length - to - breadth ratio @xmath1 on the freezing transitions and freezing parameters for the i - n , i - sm a and n - sm a transition for a system of molecule interacting via the gay - berne pair potential . the value of @xmath1 has been varied from 3.0 to 4.0 in steps of 0.2 , keeping other parameters fixed at @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "pair correlation functions needed as input information in the dft have been calculated using the percus - yevick ( py ) integral equation theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe in brief the density- functional formalism used to locate the freezing transitions and freezing parameters .",
    "we discuss our results and compare with the available simulation results in section iii and finally conclude our discussion in section iv .",
    "the density functional theory ( dft ) directly links the bulk phase behaviour of a fluid with its molecular properties . in dft",

    "the grand thermodynamic potential has the general form @xmath32 where a is the helmholtz free energy , @xmath33 the chemical potential and @xmath34 is a singlet distribution function , to locate the transition .",
    "the above mentioned minimum property of the grand thermodynamic potential follows from the variational inequality w[_eq ] w [ ] which is valid for a fixed temperature and chemical potential , where @xmath35 is the equilibrium density profile .    it is convenient to subtract the isotropic fluid thermodynamic potential from @xmath28 and write it as [ 19 ] @xmath36 with @xmath37   \\right .",

    "all the four order parameters become zero . in the nematic phase the orientational order parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 become nonzero but the other two parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 remain zero .",

    "the pcf s of the isotropic phase are found by solving ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation using percus - yevick ( py ) closure ( details are same as in reference [ 18 ] ) at different values of the reduced temperatures @xmath64 , in the range from 0.80 to 1.80 and at various densities for each @xmath65 .        .",

    "the lowest temperature where sm a phase starts stabilizing is found to rise as we increase @xmath1 . on further increase in @xmath64 ,",
    "nematic phase enters into the phase sequence .",
    "temperature range of nematic stability is found to increase as molecular elongation is increased which is also reflected in the ratio of n - sm a and i - n transition temperatures , @xmath72 .",
    "for example , the value of the ratio change from 0.96 to 0.92 as we move from @xmath73 to @xmath74 with pressure , @xmath75 , fixed at 3.5 .",
    "this corresponds to a higher orientational order before the sm a phase stabilizes . according to mcmillan theory [ 20 ] ,",
    "this value of the @xmath72 ratio predicts that the n- sm a transition is first order . figs .",
    "2(a - f ) also show that as @xmath1 is increased , both the i - n and n - sm a transitions move to a lower pressure .     for n - sm a transition at @xmath54 keeping other gb potential parameters fixed at @xmath76 and @xmath27.,width=336,height=288 ]    in figures 3 , we plot the i - n and n - sm a transition densities against the molecular elongation @xmath1 . both the i - n and n - sm a transition densities are seen to decrease with the increase in @xmath1 in agreement to reference [ 9 ] .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that the difference between the i - n and n - sm a transition densities decreases as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "this is more apparent in the low temperature curves where the region between the two transition lines gradually shrinks .",
    "this makes evident that for a given temperature , with the increase in molecular elongation , the sm a phase become more probable at low density and eventually takes over nematic resulting in direct isotropic to sm a transition .",
    "this stabilization of smectic phase is to be expected since increase in @xmath1 results in deeper well depth for parallel configuration of molecules making it energetically more favourable .",
    "also the i - n and n - sm a transition density difference is seen to decrease rapidly as the temperature is reduced at a fixed @xmath1 , showing the effect of the attractive intermolecular interaction which dominates at low temperature facilitating the formation of the sm a phase .",
    "this also indicates the possibility of direct i- sm a transition for a given @xmath1 below certain temperature where sm a phase takes over nematic .",
    "the sm a phase is characterized by the presence of a non zero translational and mixed order parameters along with the orientational order parameters .",
    "fig.4 presents the variation of the order parameters at n - sm a transition with respect to @xmath1 at temperature ( arbitrarily chosen ) @xmath77 .",
    "it shows that the order parameters are monotonically increasing with the increase in the molecular elongation . for each @xmath1",
    ", we found that the values of translational and mixed order parameters , which are characteristics of sm a phase , decrease rapidly with the increase in temperature , eventually becoming zero .",
    "this shows that the stable sm a phase becomes progressively less ordered with the increasing temperature and finally destabilizes with respect to nematic phase and disappears from the phase diagram .",
    "this is obvious as attractive forces between the molecules are less important at high temperatures and purely repulsive intermolecular interactions do not exhibit sm a. one should note that at @xmath25 , we get stable sm a phase which has not been observed in computer simulation experiments .",
    "the phase observed in simulation [ 9 ] is sm b which we have not considered in the present study . in table 1 we have compared our results for the i - n transition parameters with the simulation results of refs.[12 , 13 ] at temperature @xmath78 for @xmath25 .",
    "it can be seen that the values of the transition parameters found by us are higher than those of the simulations but relatively close to the values of ref.[13 ] .",
    ".comparison of isotropic - nematic transition parameters of the gb(3 , 5 , 2 , 1 ) potential at @xmath79 .",
    "quantities in reduced units are pressure @xmath80 and @xmath81 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the change in density at transitions @xmath82 is found to increase as @xmath1 is increased at a given temperature .",
    "for example , for @xmath66 , at i - n transition @xmath83 changes from @xmath84 to @xmath85 as @xmath1 is changed from 3.8 to 4.0 , whereas the corresponding change at the n - sm a transition is from @xmath86 to @xmath87 . in the simulation",
    "[ 9 ] , though the value of @xmath88 at the n - sm a transition increases from @xmath89 to @xmath90 as @xmath1 changes from 3.8 to 4.0 , the trend at i - n transition is reverse where it decreases from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .     and @xmath27 .",
    "the solid lines indicate the phase boundaries obtained by using the density - functional theory while dashed lines are the simulation results of brown @xmath93[9 ] . ]     and",
    "the curves are the same as in figure 5 . ]    in figs . 5 and 6 we present our phase diagram in the temperature - density plane for @xmath94 and 4.0 .",
    "the solid lines represent the phase boundaries calculated by us while dashed lines are the approximate phase boundaries taken from ref . [ 9 ] for the sake of comparison . though the quantitative agreement between the phase diagrams shown in the figures 5 and 6 is not so encouraging",
    ", however , they agree qualitatively well .",
    "this may be due to the fact that in our calculation the transition takes place at higher density than those found in the simulations",
    ". the critical correlations at which the isotropic phase become unstable are found to be higher than actual values because py theory is known to underestimate the orientational correlations[21 ] .",
    "this shortcoming of the py theory is found to increase with increasing temperature which explains why in figs .",
    "5 and 6 the i - n transition boundaries are more shifted than the n - sm a boundaries .",
    "we have used the gay - berne potential model , to study the effect of the variation of elongation parameter @xmath1 on its phase behaviour with the values of all other parameters fixed at @xmath76 and @xmath27 .",
    "the pair correlation functions of the isotropic fluid are calculated using percus - yevick integral equation theory and have been used in density - functional theory to locate the isotropic - nematic , isotropic - smectic a and nematic - smectic a transitions . within the small range of elongation @xmath95 , the phase diagram shows significant changes .",
    "we have discussed how various phase boundaries , transition densities , pressure , change in density at transition , order parameters etc .",
    "change with the variation in molecular elongation .",
    "we found a stable sm a phase for all @xmath68 .",
    "both i - n and n - sm a transitions are found to move to lower density and pressure as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "we have compared our results with those of computer simulations and found that the density - functional theory reproduces all the features of the phase diagrams which are in good qualitative agreement . to have a better quantitative agreement",
    "there is a need to evaluate the isotropic pair correlations more accurately than those given by percus - yevick theory .",
    "also the use of correlations evaluated directly in the nematic phase may improve the results .",
