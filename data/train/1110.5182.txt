    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , with its two main multipurpose detectors atlas and cms , is the experimental project that dominates present particle physics and will likely dominate its next 20 - 25 years . with the successful start of collisions at 7 tev ,",
    "the lhc has put yet another big step towards a thorough examination of the terascale .",
    "ultimately , it has replaced the older , lower - energy tevatron , which has been closed in september this year .",
    "the large energy available at the lhc has opened many multi - particle channels that are now to a large degree scrutinized .",
    "the immense amount of available phase space , and the large acceptance of the atlas and cms detectors allow for the production and identification of final states with 4 or more qcd jets together with isolated leptons .",
    "these multi - particle events hide or strongly modify all possible signals of physics beyond the standard model . in view of a correct interpretation of the signals of new physics which might be extracted from data ,",
    "it is of considerable interest to reduce our theoretical uncertainty for the physical processes under study , especially when large qcd backgrounds are involved . in this respect , the need of next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections for the lhc is unquestionable .",
    "efficient numerical evaluation of multi - particle final states at nlo qcd can be performed with the help of the helac - nlo monte carlo program @xcite .",
    "helac - nlo is an extension of the helac - phegas monte carlo program @xcite , which is based on off - shell dyson - schwinger recursive equations .",
    "it can be used to efficiently obtain helicity amplitudes and total cross sections for arbitrary multiparticle processes in the standard model and has been already extensively used and tested , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "virtual corrections are obtained using the helac-1loop program @xcite , based on the ossola - papadopoulos - pittau ( opp ) reduction technique @xcite and the reduction code cuttools @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the oneloop library @xcite has been used for the evaluation of the scalar integrals .",
    "reweighting techniques , helicity and colour sampling methods are used in order to optimize the performance of the system .",
    "in addition , the singularities from soft or collinear parton emission are isolated via catani - seymour dipole subtraction for nlo qcd calculations using a formulation for massive quarks @xcite and for arbitrary polarizations @xcite .",
    "calculations of this part are performed with the help of the helac - dipoles software @xcite .",
    "the optimization and phase space integration is executed with the help of parni @xcite and kaleu @xcite .",
    "all parts of the helac - nlo framework are publictly available .    with the help of the helac - nlo system",
    "several @xmath1 processes have recently been calculated at next - to - leading order qcd , including @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite . in this contribution , a brief report on the @xmath5 computation with complete off - shell effects is given .",
    "double- , single- and non - resonant top contributions of the order @xmath6 are consistently taken into account , which requires the introduction of a complex - mass scheme for unstable top quarks .",

    "moreover , nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath4 @xcite process have been calculated .",
    "the process @xmath11 is considered , both at the tevatron run ii and the lhc _ i.e. _ at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath12 tev and @xmath13 tev correspondingly .",
    "the standard model parameters are as follows : @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 the electromagnetic coupling and @xmath17 are derived from the fermi constant and masses of w and z bosons .",
    "the top quark mass is @xmath18 gev and all other qcd partons and leptons are treated as massless .",
    "the top quark width is @xmath19 at lo and @xmath20 at nlo where @xmath21 .",
    "the on - shell scheme is adopted for mass renormalization .",
    "all final - state partons with pseudorapidity @xmath22 are recombined into jets via the @xmath23 algorithm @xcite , the _ anti-_@xmath23 algorithm @xcite and the inclusive cambridge / aachen algorithm ( c / a ) @xcite with a cone of size @xmath24 .",
    "additional cuts are imposed on the transverse momenta and the rapidity of two recombined @xmath25-jets : @xmath26 basic selection is applied to decay products of top quarks : @xmath27 the cteq6 set of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) is consistently used @xcite .",
    "in particular , cteq6l1 pdfs with a 1-loop running @xmath28 is taken at lo and cteq6 m pdfs with a 2-loop running @xmath28 at nlo .",
