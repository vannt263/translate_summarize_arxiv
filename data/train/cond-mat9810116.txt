    "many rather astonishing phenomena are known to occur when granular materials like sand or powders move   @xcite . of interest",
    "are , e.g.  density waves emitted from outlets  @xcite , crack formation during vibration or during the flow through a pipe @xcite , and pattern formation due to dissipation @xcite .",
    "all these effects are connected to the ability of granular materials to form a hybrid state between a fluid and a solid : energy input can lead to a reduction of density so that the material becomes ` fluid ' and , on the other hand , in the absence of energy input , granular materials ` solidify ' due to dissipation .",
    "thus , a packing of sand behaves like a solid when pushed , but offers no resistance to a pulling force .    in order to formalize and quantify the complicated rheology of granular media various attempts",
    "have been made .",
    "continuum equations of motion and kinetic theories   @xcite are the first successful steps towards a quantitative description of granular materials  at least for limited parameter range .",
    "this restriction exists because it is very difficult to incorporate into these theories all the details of static friction or other relevant microscopic mechanisms .",
    "also the generalization to high densities is an ardous task , see for example refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "most of the classical , but also the more advanced theories are based on the assumption of molecular chaos  the assumption that the velocities and the relative positions of all colliding pairs of particles in a gas are uncorrelated . in a dilute gas ,",
    "the errors introduced by this assumption are negligible . in dense granular flows , however , correlations between colliding particles may be important , leading to qualitative changes of behavior .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] is dedicated to a brief introduction of the different discrete modeling approaches .",
    "in particular , we will present the ` hard - particle ' event driven ( ed ) @xcite and the ` soft - particle ' molecular dynamics ( md )  @xcite methods , both for inelastic spherical particles with frictional forces . we extend the traditional ed method by introducing a cut - off time @xmath0 for dissipation @xcite . any particle that encounters a second collision before this time passed by",
    "is assumed to be elastic  the extended method is named tced @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) approach is discussed and applied to freely cooling granular media .",
    "the validity of the molecular chaos assumption in granular flows was examined by comparing event driven ( ed ) ` hard sphere ' simulations to those performed with the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) method @xcite .",
    "the ed method is capable of reproducing velocity correlations  even in the limit of rather large densities  whereas dsmc assumes molecular chaos by construction . in section   [ sec : edvsdsmc ] the structure factor and the pair - correlation function",
    "are examined and reasons for the breakdown of molecular chaos are discussed .",
    "the clustering instability is described in section [ sec : cluster ] with respect to the restitution coefficient and a cut - off time for dissipation . the probability distribution function for the collision frequency",
    "is measured in the homogeneous and the non - homogeneous clustering case and differences are evidenced @xcite . the same is also found in pipe flow @xcite where shock waves and arching are the observed cooperative phenomena .",
    "the probability distribution functions are measured and discussed in section  [ sec : pipeflow ] and interestingly have the same functional behavior as in the case of the clustering instability .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the basic constitutents of granular materials are mesoscopic grains , made of , for example , @xmath1 molecules .",
    "when these objects interact ( collide ) the attractive potentials of the individual atoms can often be neglected .",
    "three models for the particle - particle interactions are discussed in the following .",
    "they account for the excluded volume of the particles via a repulsive potential , either ` hard ' or ` soft ' , or assume point particles and introduce appropriate corrections .",
    "it is important that the surface of the grains is rough on a microscopic scale so that solid friction occurs . in general , one has to distinguish between sliding , sticking , and rolling friction , but we will only discuss simplified models here . an entire discipline called tribology has evolved to study solid friction in depth  @xcite .",
    "friction and other sources of dissipation , like viscous damping or plastic deformations , have the crucial consequence that the system _ does not conserve energy_. since dissipation may occur due to various reasons , we discuss in the following only simple dissipation laws , assuming that the detailed knowledge of the interaction potential is of minor importance .",
    "in fact , complicated laws often increase the number of parameters without giving qualitatively different results @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two most frequently used discrete element methods is the repulsive interaction potential . for the molecular dynamics ( md )",
    "method , soft particles with a power - law interaction potential are assumed , whereas for the event driven ( ed ) method perfectly rigid particles are used .",
    "the consequence is that the duration of the contact of two particles , @xmath0 , is finite for md , but vanishes for ed . in the dsmc method",
    ", one assumes point particles without repulsive potential but with an effective scattering cross section .",
    "in addition one applies corrections from the kinetic theory , in order to account for the effective free volume , the reduced mean free path , the increased collision frequency , and the enhanced collisional momentum transport .      here",
