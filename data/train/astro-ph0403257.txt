    "there are almost twenty detections of massive black holes ( bhs ) in galaxy centers that employ the technique of orbit superposition modeling @xcite .",
    "the orbit superposition technique is based on a method originally invented by @xcite , who noted that the time - averaged orbits in a stationary potential can be summed ( at finite spatial resolution ) to match the mass distribution that gives rise to the potential , thereby producing an equilibrium dynamical model .",
    "the schwarzschild method was first used to analyze kinematic data for evidence of bhs in galaxy centers by richstone & tremaine ( 1985 ) for m87 and dressler & richstone ( 1988 ) for m31 and m32 .",
    "those early models were spherically symmetric . in modern implementations of this method",
    ", large sets of orbits are run in a specified axisymmetric potential ( based on the starlight distribution and a central point mass ) and then a non - negative linear superposition of orbits is found that best matches the kinematic and photometric observations .",
    "the usual goal of this process is the determination of only two quantities , the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath1 ( assumed to be independent of position ) and the bh mass @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter vme ) and @xcite have challenged the reliability of bh mass determinations obtained via orbit superposition modeling .",
    "cretton & emsellem also argue that the uncertainties noted by vme can be dealt with via regularization ( smoothing the distribution of orbit weights ) .",
    "vme raise a long list of problems and features of the orbit - superposition analysis technique .",
    "they focus on two main issues : orbit insufficiency and data insufficiency .",
    "first , they contend that the bh mass determination is artificially narrowed through the use of too small an orbit library and imply , but do not show , that we have made this mistake .",
    "in addition they suggest that the absence of a flat - bottomed @xmath0 profile as a function of bh mass indicates that this problem has occurred .",
    "second , they suggest that the bh mass @xmath2 can only be determined if the radius of influence @xmath3 where the bh dominates the stellar dynamics is well - resolved spectroscopically ( here @xmath4 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion ) . in each of their main points",
    "they have fastened on one facet of rather complex problems .",
    "we show in  2 that the use of an orbit library which is too small is an easily avoided elementary trap . in ",
    "3 we refer the reader to other work in which we show that we have adequate resolution to determine bh masses reliably , and argue that the presence of extensive radial kinematic coverage mitigates the uncertainties associated with a `` not well - resolved '' radius of influence .",
    "we also show that the `` flat - bottomed '' behavior of @xmath0 is a feature whose presence depends on several features of the quality and extent of the kinematic data , not just the size of the orbit library .",
    "the principal result is that a @xmath0 profile constructed using our method does indicate the range of acceptable bh masses in a manner easily judged by the readers of our papers .",
    "there appear to be at least three independent axisymmetric orbit - superposition codes , one developed by various leiden students starting with van  der  marel  and continuing through verolme and cappellari , another developed by gebhardt and richstone and used by our collaboration ( the `` nukers '' ) since 1996 , and a third described by vme .",
    "all practitioners agree that the orbits can be sampled by examining launch points in the three - dimensional space spanned by the isolating integrals : the energy per unit mass @xmath5 , the @xmath6-component of the angular momentum @xmath7 , and the third integral @xmath8 .",
    "we further agree that this space is finite  only bound orbits matter ( @xmath9 ) , the range of @xmath10 at fixed energy lies between zero and the angular momentum of a circular orbit of that energy , and the distribution of the third integral can be sampled by launching the orbits with zero velocity from positions spread across the zero velocity surface at fixed @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "the remaining question is how densely or sparsely spaced these orbital parameters need to be ( and therefore how many orbits are required ) .",
    "the answer depends in part on the spatial resolution sought in the model , and in part on the complexity of the orbit structure in phase space , and therefore on the mass distribution .    nonetheless , it is possible to estimate the number of orbits required to represent all possibilities .",
    "the eventual construction of the model requires matching the ( stellar ) mass density in a set of bins spanning the physical space of the ( axisymmetric ) model this bin set is composed of one radial dimension ( of @xmath11 bins , which are logarithmically spaced except very near the center ) and one angular dimension ( of @xmath12 bins , which are equally spaced in @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the latitude ) . to fully sample the equatorial orbits , we follow orbits with apocenter and pericenter in all possible pairs of radial bins ; this requires roughly @xmath15 orbits .",
    "we then assign @xmath5 and @xmath7 from the apo - peri sampling of the equatorial orbits and then use the same @xmath5 and @xmath7 for non - equatorial orbits .",
    "for each @xmath5 and @xmath7 pair , we drop a set of orbits from points on the zero - velocity curve equally spaced in @xmath13 and more finely spaced than the angular bins .",
    "the models described here have 20 radial bins and 5 angular bins , hence our _ nominal _ orbit library contains @xmath1610,000 orbits .",
    "the initial factor of 2 comes from including each orbit s retrograde mirror image in the library , and the trailing factor of 25 results from oversampling the 5 angular bins by a factor of @xmath17 .",
    "even if one does not trust this estimate , it is straightforward to investigate whether the orbit library is large enough by changing the number of orbits in the library .",
    "if the results are independent of the number of orbits then presumably the library is large enough .",
    "we created an orbit library as described above to model the galaxy ngc 821 and illustrate the results in figure 1 .",
    "the observations are described in @xcite and in  3 and the modeling is described in @xcite we chose ngc 821 to correct an error in the models in @xcite , which used an incorrect hubble space telescope ( hst ) point - spread function that did not reflect the spatial binning of the stis ccd ( this was the only one of the 12 galaxies in that paper in which this error was made ) .",
    "the revised mass is @xmath18 , at a distance of 24.1 megaparsecs , a factor of 2.3 higher than was reported previously ( at the same distance ) . in order to conduct the experiment illustrated in figure 1 we oversampled the grid by a factor of 2 relative to the prescription above in each dimension and then dropped out orbits at random to obtain the libraries illustrated . in figure 1",
    "we show the @xmath0 profile as a function of bh mass ( we have already marginalized over the galaxy mass - to - light ratio ) .",
    "for small orbit libraries , figure 1 exhibits the ragged @xmath0 emphasized by vme .",
    "it also shows that for our nominal library with @xmath1910,000 orbits , the @xmath0 profile is smooth enough to infer bh mass estimates and uncertainties , and that that larger libraries do not alter the mass estimate .",
    "once the number of orbits is large enough that the @xmath0 profile does not change as it is increased further , _",
    "the inferred bh mass does not depend on the number of orbits _ , and",
    "the phase - space coverage _ must _ be good enough .",
    "a second major point made by vme is that estimates of bh mass are unreliable if the bh radius of influence @xmath20 is not `` well - resolved '' by the kinematic data .",
    "this is one facet of the rich question of what different kinds of kinematic data reveal about the gravitational field of the galaxy .",
    "the geometry of the kinematic data can be characterized by : ( 1 ) the spatial resolution compared to @xmath20 ; ( 2 ) the radial extent of the data ( how far out the data extend ) ; ( 3 ) the angular coverage ( how many position angles , or whether there is integral - field data ) ; and ( 4 ) the sparseness of the data ( in radius and angle ) .",
    "in addition to these geometrical characteristics , the quality of the data ( signal - to - noise and systematic errors such as template mismatches ) also determines what one can measure . a complete investigation of all these issues is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we emphasize the distinction between _ precision _ ( are the error bars small ? ) and _ reliability _ ( are the error bars accurately estimated ? ) .",
    "we shall argue that geometric limitations to the quality of the kinematic data of the four kinds listed above reduce the precision of estimates of @xmath2 , but the range of acceptable masses can still be judged from the @xmath0 profile , and therefore the mass determination is reliable .",
    "we parameterize the resolution of the kinematic data near the center in terms of @xmath21 , where @xmath20 is the bh radius of influence defined earlier , @xmath22 is the distance , and @xmath23 is the full - width - half - maximum telescope resolution .",
    "vme argue that the resolution @xmath24 must be much greater than unity for accurate bh mass determinations , although they do not give a clear numerical criterion .",
    "a number of the bh mass determinations have @xmath24 only slightly larger than unity . in the example of",
    "ngc 821 discussed below , @xmath25 ( the observations were made at 8500  with a 0 1 slit ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , so @xmath28 .",
    "vme s argument that observations with this resolution can not determine @xmath2 is made without regard to the signal - to - noise of the data available . even in the limit @xmath29 , excellent s /",
    "n data can reveal the presence of a bh .",
    "given a model with constant mass - to - light ratio @xmath1 , a central mass @xmath2 and a perfect losvd measured with @xmath30 , the shape of the losvd at low velocities ( comparable to velocity dispersion of the galaxy as a whole ) determines @xmath1 , and the shape and extent of the high - velocity wings of the losvd determines the mass of a central bh .",
    "we have investigated the effect of varying the resolution @xmath24 on our determinations of @xmath2 by comparing our masses determined using both high - resolution hst data and low - resolution ground - based data to masses determined using the same method with ground - based data alone .",
    "the addition of hst data generally improves @xmath24 by a factor of 5 , from less than unity to greater than unity .",
    "the results of these experiments are shown in figure 8 in @xcite and figure 4 in @xcite .",
    "we find that improved resolution generally improves the precision of the measured @xmath2 by narrowing the @xmath0 profile , but the improved best - fit @xmath2 always lies within the range given by the estimated errors from the low - resolution data .",
    "this experiment is evidence that the @xmath0 profiles do exactly what they are supposed to ",
    "they provide an estimate of @xmath2 and of its uncertainty .",
    "lower resolution data yield less precise values of @xmath2 , but not unreliable ones .",
    "we next investigate the influence of kinematic data at larger radii on the precision of the bh measurement ( points 2 and 3 above ) , using data from ngc 821 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this example shows that the @xmath0 profile broadens and flattens as data at large radii and along the minor axis are discarded .",
    "the changes in the @xmath0 profile imply a decrease in the precision of the measurement of @xmath2 and indicate the increased errors .",
    "if only hst data is used then models with and without a bh are both acceptable , because of the degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath1 when only data inside and near the radius of influence are used .",
    "note that the one model with only major axis data ( the dashed line ) yields a flat - bottomed @xmath0 profile and a very uncertain estimate of @xmath2 compared to the model with additional data along the minor axis .",
    "we conclude that inadequate spatial coverage of kinematics far from the bh can lead to a poorly defined bh mass and a flat - bottomed @xmath0 just as readily as can poorly resolved data ( @xmath31 ) in the galaxy center ) . again",
    ", inadequate spatial coverage leads to imprecise bh mass estimates , but not unreliable ones .",
    "turning to point 4 , sparse radial sampling of the kinematic data ( which we never do ) can also produce a flat bottomed @xmath0 profile [ as illustrated in figure 3 in @xcite ] by pushing up or down velocity moments at unobserved radii to maximize or minimize model parameters .",
    "kinematic data with better geometry ( both resolution and spatial coverage ) leads to smaller uncertainties in the bh mass .",
    "however , in all of the examples discussed above , the shape of the @xmath0 profile provides an accurate estimate of this uncertainty , no matter how poor the data geometry may be . in the absence of good spatial coverage , data that resolves the radius of influence , or sufficiently high signal to noise",
    ", the bh mass will simply not be well determined , but in our experiments the true mass still lies within our error bounds .",
    "we have made a point of distinguishing between _ imprecise _ ( the error bars are large ) measurements of the bh mass @xmath2 and _ unreliable _ ones ( the error bars are wrong ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that increasing the number of orbits beyond our standard prescription does not broaden the range of bh masses allowed by our method .",
    "contrary to the assertion of vme , we must be using enough orbits .",
    "the issue of data sufficiency is far more complex . in  3 we illustrate ( or cite ) several ways that data insufficiency can lead to imprecise @xmath2 estimates .",
    "we also argue that these estimates are _ imprecise _ , not unreliable .",
    "probably the best evidence for this is the fact that our @xmath2 estimates obtained with genuine orbit - superposition models lie within their own errors of repeat studies with greatly improved resolution @xcite . ] .",
    "flat - bottomed profiles  a special case of imprecision  can be produced by kinematic data with limited radial or angular coverage , by sparsely sampled data , or by insufficient resolution .",
    "a fourth way to produce a flat bottomed @xmath0 profile is the use of _ noiseless _ datasets constructed from two - integral models @xcite .",
    "this procedure creates models that match the data perfectly",
    ". since axisymmetric models have more freedom than two - integral models , a range of three integral distribution functions will  by construction ",
    "provide an _ exact _ match to the data . since @xmath0 is bounded by zero , a flat bottom in the @xmath0 plot",
    "is unavoidable .",
    "@xcite argue that regularization ( smoothing the distribution of orbit weights ) reduces the uncertainty in @xmath2 .",
    "our models use a form of regularization ( maximum entropy ) but only as a numerical technique to accelerate convergence : we iterate our models while steadily reducing the weight of the entropy to the best - fit criterion until there is no further change in the best - fit model .",
    "@xcite study models with and without regularization for m32 and find no difference in the best fit bh mass .",
    "this paper has examined the two most serious recent criticisms of bh mass estimates from orbit superposition .",
    "we conclude that the issues raised by these criticisms have not led us to report erroneous bh masses .",
    "there are a number of other tests of our procedure that also indicate that our method is reliable :    1",
    ".   our method has been successfully blind - tested against ( spherical ) jaffe models containing bhs ; 2 .",
    "our method yields the same masses as the leiden code when applied to the same data ( for ngc 821 and m32 ) ; 3 .",
    "bhs weighed by this method display the same distribution of residuals from the mass - velocity dispersion relation as bhs weighed via gas dynamics @xcite .",
    "the bh masses published by our group ( @xcite ) are obtained using an adequate number of orbits .",
    "the plots of @xmath32 we publish provide the reader with an accurate assessment of the precision of the results .",
    "so far as we can tell , bh masses published from the leiden group ( @xcite ) also should be reliable .",
    "we thank the director and staff of the carnegie institution observatories for hospitality during a meeting at which this paper was developed .",
    "support for proposals 8591 , 9106 and 9107 was provided by a grant from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc , under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555 .",
    "this research was also supported by nasa grant nag 5 - 8238 ."
