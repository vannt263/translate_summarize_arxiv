    "modern big - bang cosmology firmly predicts the existence of a relic neutrino background , and relates its temperature to the temperature of the background microwave radiation @xmath2 see , e.g. the basic texts @xcite .",
    "verifying the existence of the relic neutrino sea represents one of the main challenges of modern cosmology .",
    "clearly , in contrast to the study of the background microwave radiation that has a long history and has reached an unprecendented accuracy ( see , e.g. the latest results in @xcite ) , detection of relic neutrinos remains an unfulfilled dream .",
    "various strategies have been proposed so far , based on laboratories searches @xcite and astrophysical observations @xcite , such as absorption dips in the flux of ultra high energy neutrinos ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) . as far as their detection in laboratory experiments",
    "is concerned , one needs to overcome two main obstacles : the low cross section characteristic of weak interactions and the low energy of relic neutrinos .",
    "the second obstacle can be overcome if the corresponding detection reactions have vanishing thresholds .",
    "therefore we discuss here the possibility of detecting the relic neutrinos by the charged current reactions using radioactive unstable nuclei as targets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we derive expressions for the charged current neutrino induced reaction cross sections involving nonrelativistic neutrinos . we show that such cross sections , when the corresponding reaction has a vanishing threshold , scale with @xmath3 so that the number of events converges to a constant for @xmath4 . in the following section we discuss the possibility to use a tritium target to detect the cosmological @xmath5 .",
    "we show that the main challenge is the separation of the produced electrons with energies just above the endpoint of the @xmath6 spectrum from the overwhelming flux of the electrons from the tritium @xmath6 decay that extends just below the 18.6 kev endpoint .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of a resonance enhancement of reactions involving cosmological neutrinos .",
    "we show that the charged current reactions , included the radiative ones , do not have a resonance character . in the conclusion",
    "we summarize our findings and stress the need for an extreme energy resolution if sensitivity to detect sub - ev mass relic neutrinos should be reached .",
    "let us first recapitulate briefly the cross section for massless neutrinos .",
    "we use the reaction @xmath7 as an example .",
    "this can be easily modified for reactions without threshold such as @xmath8 since we are interested in very low energy neutrinos , we can treat nucleons nonrelativistically , and keep only the lowest order terms in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the standard expression is then ( @xmath11 , see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the momentum transferred squared and @xmath14 is the square of the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy .",
    "starting with the usual current @xmath15 current weak interaction @xmath16 [ \\bar{v}_{\\nu } \\gamma^{\\mu } ( 1 - \\gamma_5 ) v_e]\\ ] ] where @xmath17 are the vector and axial - vector form factors respectively , we arrive at the squared matrix element ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath18 evaluating it in the laboratory frame where the proton is at rest , and keeping only the leading terms one gets @xmath19 ~.\\ ] ] with @xmath20 the neutron and proton masses .",
    "furthermore , using @xmath21 in the laboratory frame , and using the jacobian @xmath22 we obtain the usual lowest order expression @xcite @xmath23 ~.\\ ] ] with @xmath24 .",
    "let us now consider the case of massive neutrinos . in eq.([e:4 ] ) one should then substitute @xcite @xmath25[s - ( m_p - m_{\\nu})^2 ] = 4 m_p^2 p_{\\nu}^2 ~,\\ ] ] where the last expression is again in the laboratory frame .",
    "the jacobian in eq.([e:8 ] ) becomes instead @xmath26 the cross section is then given by ( using @xmath27 as in the eq .",

    "such a behaviour is in agreement with the general form for the cross section associated to exothermic reactions of nonrelativistic particles @xcite .",
    "we see that this form is a  natural one \" that in most cases of practical importance , when @xmath30 , acquires the standard form eq.([e:9 ] ) .    the interaction cross section of very low energy neutrinos , eq.([e:12 ] )",
    "was implicitly used long time ago by weinberg @xcite . very recently",
    "this process has attracted particular interest thanks to the work by cocco _",
    "@xcite where the authors have considered the possibility of detecting cosmological neutrinos through their capture on radioactive beta decaying ( and hence with no threshold ) nuclei .    in the case of nuclear ( stable or unstable ) targets , i.e. reactions",
    "@xmath31 when possible , one would use the usually known @xmath32 value of the inverse radioactive decay to eliminate the fundamental constants and the nuclear matrix element ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath33 with @xmath34 in units of @xmath35 . here",
    "the averaging is done over the incoming flux , @xmath36 is in seconds , the statistical function @xmath37 and the electron energy @xmath38 and momentum @xmath39 are evaluated with @xmath40 as a unit of energy , and the nuclear matrix element is excluded using the relation @xmath41 . for the neutrino capture on stable targets ( i.e. with a threshold )",
    "the electron energy is simply ( neglecting recoil ) @xmath42 .",
    "so , for the @xmath43 induced reactions @xmath44 and for the @xmath5 induced reactions @xmath45 .",
    "for the capture on a radioactive target @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "let us now consider the possibility to use the neutrino capture by radioactive beta - decaying nuclei to detect cosmological neutrinos .",
    "for this aim the relevant quantity is the number of events , i.e. the cross section times the flux . for the latter , the dependence on @xmath48 in eqs.([e:12 ] , [ e:14 ] ) is canceled out and one obtains the number of events that converges to a constant when @xmath4 , in agreement with @xcite . as an example of the possible application of the above",
    "finding let us consider the @xmath5 capture on tritium , as done in @xcite . while our conclusions are qualitatively similar to the conclusions reached by cocco _",
    "@xcite , they differ in several significant details .",
    "tritium decays into @xmath49he with the half - life of 12.3 years .",
    "the decay @xmath50 value is 18.6 kev , and @xmath51 = 1143 . from eq.([e:14]-[e:15 ] ) we deduce the cross section for @xmath52 k nonrelativistic neutrinos @xmath53 here , in the first equation we used that @xmath54 . in making that estimate",
    "we neglected the @xmath55 virial motion of massive neutrinos in the galactic halo , and the motion of earth and solar system with respect to the random motion of the neutrinos .    in order to evaluate possible count rate",
    ", we have to know the number density of the background @xmath5 sea .",
    "its average value , for neutrinos evenly distributed throughout the whole universe , corresponds to @xmath56 k. for neutrinos ( or antineutrinos ) of one flavor only @xmath57 is @xmath58 55 @xmath59 .",
    "massive neutrinos will be gravitationally clustered on the scale of @xmath58 mpc for neutrinos with @xmath60 1 ev , that is on the scale of galaxy clusters ( probably the clustering scale is even larger ) . assuming that in that case the ratio of the dimensionless neutrino and baryon densities @xmath61 remains the same as in the universe as a whole , we obtain @xmath62 for @xmath63 ev and @xmath64 @xmath59 for a cluster of galaxies . in the following we do not use the last estimate and treat this ratio as an unknown @xmath65 dependent parameter .",
    "a more elaborated study of neutrino clustering is made for example in @xcite , giving smaller but nonnegligible clustering for @xmath661 ev .",
    "note , however , that much larger neutrino clustering was considered in refs .",
    "the authors of these papers speculate that features in the cosmic - ray spectra , in particular the ` knee ' at @xmath583 pev , are associated with the threshold of the @xmath67 reaction on @xmath580.5 ev mass neutrinos .",
    "the physics basis for the required clustering of @xmath68 is not provided in those papers .",
    "the capture rate per tritium atom is @xmath69 let us assume , probably much too optimistically , that one can use a megacurie source of tritium ( 1 mcu = 3.7@xmath70 decays / s , i.e. 2.1@xmath71 tritium atoms @xmath58 100 g of tritium ) .",
    "the number of events is then @xmath72 thus , if our assumption about the gravitational clustering is at least nearly correct , the capture rate would be reasonably large . however , the main issue would be whether the primordial background neutrino capture signal would be detectable given the overwhelming rate of the radioactive decay .",
    "electrons from the ordinary @xmath6 decay are distributed over the kinetic energy interval @xmath73 , smeared by the resolution of the detection apparatus . on the other hand , electrons from the background neutrino captures",
    "are monoenergetic with the kinetic energy @xmath74 again smeared by resolution .",
    "thus , the signal to noise ratio will critically depend on the neutrino mass @xmath65 and on the energy resolution @xmath75 .",
    "note that the fraction of electrons in an energy interval of width @xmath75 just below the endpoint is @xmath76 .    to appreciate the problem we show in fig.[fig : schematic ] the tail of the spectrum of tritium @xmath6 decay folded with a gaussian resolution function and the signal of the cosmological @xmath5 capture electrons evaluated for @xmath77 and clearly separated in this idealized situation from the background .",
    "remarkably , the ratio of the background neutrino capture rate and the competing @xmath6 decay with final electron within the resolution interval @xmath75 just below the endpoint , does not depend on the corresponding @xmath78 value ( see @xcite , their eq.(23 ) ) and , naturally , on the nuclear matrix element .",
    "for @xmath79 the corresponding ratio is @xmath80 this appears to be a hopelessly small number .    before discussing the issues further ,",
    "let us point out that other sources of background , for example the capture of solar @xmath81 neutrinos , are not dangerous .",
    "the total solar @xmath81 neutrino flux is @xmath82",
    "@xmath83 s@xmath84 distributed over 420 kev @xcite .",
    "thus , the flux in the lowest 10 ev is only about @xmath85 @xmath83 s@xmath84 , which is less than 1% of the effective flux of the primordial @xmath5 even for @xmath86 1 ev .",
    "one should note that the discussed method is intresting only as long as neutrinos are non - relativistic with v@xmath87c .",
    "for higher energy neutrinos ( like thermal solar neutrinos that have an estimated flux of @xmath88/@xmath35/sec / mev and energies @xmath58 1 kev @xcite ) signal becomes well separated from radioactive ion decay background , however the number of expected events will be very small , since one is obliged to work with very small amount of active material .",
    "the @xmath58kev mass sterile neutrinos , considered in the literature ( see , e.g. @xcite ) are unobservable due to their extremely small mixing with the active neutrinos .    if one could achieve a resolution @xmath75 that is less than the neutrino mass @xmath65 , the signal to background ratio would increase since the @xmath6 spectrum ends at @xmath89 while the electrons from neutrino capture have energy @xmath90 .",
    "the corresponding gain , i.e. the suppression of the tail of the @xmath6 decay spectrum , is estimated in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath91 it is @xmath92 i.e. , it is an extremely steep function of @xmath0 . according to such estimate",
    "a signal to background ratio of the order of unity could be reached if the ratio @xmath93 .",
    "since @xmath65 remains unknown , an experiment with a fixed resolution @xmath75 would be able to observe the background neutrino sea only if @xmath65 is large enough .",
    "a numerical calculation suggests that in fact @xmath94 is enough to achieve a signal to background ratio of order of unity .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] where @xmath75 is the full width at half maximum of the assumed gaussian resolution function and the signal as well as the background are centered at @xmath95 and integrated over an interval of width @xmath75 .",
    "the figure also shows that this ratio is such a steep function of @xmath0 that it is essentially independent of the enhancement of @xmath96 due to the gravitational clustering .",
    "( note , however , that the signal itself , i.e. the number of events , is proportional to the clustering ratio @xmath97 . )",
    "figure [ fig : ratio ] shows that in order to achieve sensitivity to sub ev neutrino masses a resolution width below @xmath58 0.5 ev would be necessary .",
    "obviously , that is a very challenging requirement .",
    "we wish now to discuss the possible resonance character of the neutrino capture on nuclei at threshold .",
    "the interest in the possible resonance effects was whetted by the attempts of raghavan @xcite , that even so they are unsuccessful so far , stimulated lively discussion .",
    "for the primordial background neutrinos the de broglie wavelength is extremely large , @xmath98 for @xmath99 = 1.9 k. that estimate is no longer valid for the gravitationally clustered massive neutrinos , that acquire the corresponding virial velocity .",
    "nevertheless , their de broglie wavelength remains macroscopically large .    if a resonance reaction could occur , and if it can be somehow described by a breit - wigner type formula where the integrated reaction cross section is @xmath100 a very large cross section could be obtained . here",
    "@xmath101 is the partial width for the elastic scattering , @xmath102 for the capture , and @xmath103 is the total width . in the case of neutrino",
    "induced reactions , obviously , there is only one channel , and all @xmath103 values should be identical .",
    "mikaleyan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered a resonance scenario for the endothermic reaction ( not observed as yet ) @xmath104 where @xmath105 is stable , @xmath106 is radioactive with an endpoint @xmath107 , and the captured electron is an orbital one in @xmath105 .",
    "the reaction occurs when @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the binding energy of the captured electron , so its threshold is @xmath110 below the threshold for the inverse @xmath6 decay .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for the process ( [ e:22 ] ) the factor @xmath111 in the cross section formula eq.([e:23 ] ) is compensated by the @xmath112 dependence of the total width @xmath103 ( @xmath113 in this case ) . moreover",
    ", the resonance electron capture can not occur for a radioactive ( hence exothermic ) target @xmath105 .    while the reaction ( [ e:24 ] ) is indeed of resonance character and",
    "occurs only when the incoming @xmath43 has a fixed energy , the zero threshold reactions ( with radioactive @xmath105 ) @xmath114 are not of resonance character .",
    "they can proceed for any energy of the incoming @xmath43 , including nonrelativistic energies , but they can not be described by the resonance formula and the cross section is never close to the value of @xmath115 as in eq.([e:23 ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the charged current cross section of nonrelativistic neutrinos scales like @xmath29 in agreement with the generic behavior of the cross sections for slow particles .",
    "that means , in particular , that the charged current reactions with vanishing threshold of nonrelativistic neutrinos have a rate that converges to a finite value as @xmath4 . with that in mind",
    "we evaluate the cross section and reaction rate of the relic @xmath43 on tritium nuclei .",
    "if a modest gravitational clustering enhancement of the relic neutrino number density is present , the number of events is large enough that it might be potentially observable .",
    "the more important issue is the elimination of the overwhelming background of the electrons from tritium @xmath6 decay .",
    "we show that signal / background ratio of the order of unity can be achieved only if the neutrino mass @xmath65 exceeds the characteristic experimental resolution width @xmath75 by a factor of two or more .",
