    "models of interest for applications in plasma and condensed matter physics as well as in molecular biology and chemistry are described by many degrees of freedom hamiltonians of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a nonlinear interaction potential among the @xmath3 particles of mass @xmath4 , located on a regular lattice , whose sites are labelled by the integer index @xmath5 .",
    "the displacement and momentum canonical coordinates of the @xmath5-th particle are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "apart ramarkable exceptions like the toda chain @xcite , a generic choice for @xmath8 yields a chaotic dynamics .",
    "one of the main issues in this field is the existence of different levels of chaos that typically occur when some control parameter ( e.g. energy or energy density ) is varied .",
    "fermi , pasta and ulam in their pioneeering numerical experiment @xcite , first observed the strong rigidity of low-@xmath9 excitations that prevented equipartion of the energy among the fourier modes over exceedingly large time scales .",
    "izrailev and chirikov provided an explanation of this fact in terms of the resonance - overlap criterion @xcite , while more refined numerical experiments showed that , for sufficiently high energies , equipartition among the fourier modes sets in very rapidly @xcite .",
    "in particular , already bocchieri et al .",
    "@xcite raised the question of the existence of an energy threshold separating a quasi - regular dynamics from a highly chaotic phase .",
    "nowadays , there is theoretical and numerical evidence that such a threshold does exist for large values of @xmath3 . in this respect",
    ", it is worth stressing the following points :    * this threshold in general occurs at energy values that prevent any possibility of quantitative explanation in terms of the canonical perturbation theory ; * in the strongly chaotic phase the time needed to reach equipartition is almost independent of energy and @xmath3 ; just beyond the threshold it suddenly increases , while the dynamics results to be very weakly chaotic .",
    "these remarks point out that the equipartition threshold ( et ) separates definitely different dynamical regimes , in such a way that for sufficiently small energies the time needed for approaching equilibrium properties may become so long that the dynamics maintains an ordered structure over any practically available time scale . @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it should be stressed that et does not seem to exhibit analogies with the standard scenario of equilibrium phase transitions : for instance , it is not at all clear which kind of symmetry breaking mechanism , if any , could be responsible for the slowing down of energy equipartition among the fourier modes .",
    "a further crucial problem concerns the persistence of et in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is a key point that recently led various authors to reconsider this problem , by exploiting different approaches and techniques .",
    "let us briefly summarize the state of the art .",
    "some investigations have refined the original approach based on the study of energy equipartition among the fourier modes : the so - called spectral entropy was first introduced as a global observable able to quantify the amount of energy equipartition @xcite .",
    "the scaling properties of this quantity have been carefully analyzed in ref.s @xcite , yielding the conclusion that the time needed to reach energy equipartition scales in a nontrivial way with both the energy and @xmath3 .",
    "further numerical investigations and theoretical arguments based on an improved treatment of the chrikov s resonance overlap criterion @xcite indicate that , at least for low-@xmath9 modes excitations , et should vanish in the thermodynamic limit .    an alternative approach to the characterization of the different dynamical regimes occurring in models like ( [ hamilton ] ) has been pursued by directly investigating proper geometrical features of the phase space .",
    "concepts and tools taken from riemannian geometry were translated in hamiltonian language in @xcite . by exploiting such techniques it has been possible to obtain an analytic estimate in the thermodynamic limit of the maximum lyapunov exponent as a function of the energy density for the fpu @xmath0-model @xcite .",
    "it exhibits a crossover between a weak and a strong chaotic regime when the energy density is increased beyond a threshold value , that has been identified as the strong stochasticity threshold ( sst ) @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions in favour of the existence of sst in the thermodynamic limit have been drawn by considering other specific geometrical indicators , like generalized curvatures of the phase space , whose reliability has been tested for various models @xcite . by the way",
    ", theese studies also indicate that in the strongly chaotic regime these models may still be far from ergodic .    upon all of these remarks",
    ", one might wonder if the existence of a threshold ( either et or sst ) may have some influence on the equilibrium statistical properties of many degrees of freedom hamiltonian models . beyond the evident interest of such a question for the foundations of statistical mechanics ,",
    "this is a crucial point for molecular dynamics applications , that usually assume the validity of the ergodic hypothesis , i.e. the equivalence of time and ensemble averages .",
    "such a problem would be solved from the very beginning if one could prove ergodicity for a model like ( 1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is possible only in a few special cases . on the other hand",
    ", it is commonly accepted that chaoticity should be sufficient for reproducing reliable statistical predictions for most of the observables of physical interest .",
    "a partial disproval of this assumption was obtained in @xcite , where it has been shown that the equivalence between time and ensemble averages for canonical thermodynamic observables ( e.g. internal energy and specific heat ) mainly depend on the model and on the nature of the observable , rather than on the degree of chaoticity of the dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we aim to clarify most of these open points by tackling the problem through the direct comparison of statistical and dynamical properties of microcanonical thermodynamic observables .",
    "the general formalism yielding explicit dynamical expressions for such observables is introduced in section ii , where we also comment on their geometrical nature .",
    "the results obtained by molecular dynamics calculations for the fpu @xmath0-model are reported in section iii .",
    "we show that sst is predicted by the decay rate of the temporal autocorrelation function associated with the microcanonical temperature and specific heat , while ergodic - like properties are found to depend mainly on the observable at hand , irrespectively of the degree of chaoticity of the dynamics .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are contained in section iv .",
    "the equivalence in the thermodynamic limit of the predictions obtained from different statistical ensembles ( @xmath10-canonical , canonical and @xmath11-canonical ) is a widely accepted and partially proved fact @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for thermodynamic observables are usually computed by canonical averages .",
    "their relation with the corresponding microcanonical averages was established in a celebrated paper by lebowitz , percus and verlet @xcite . only recently",
    "rugh , assuming ergodicity of the phase space , obtained a general rigorous expression for the temperature of the microcanonical ensemble , that results to be strictly related to the geometrical structure of the phase space @xcite .",
    "analogously , an explicit formula for the specific heat at constant volume has been also obtained @xcite .    in",
    "what follows we are going to reproduce the expressions of these microcanonical thermodynamic quantities , by exploiting a different approach , based on standard tools of differential geometry ( see the appendix ) .",
    "we find that any of these quantities is an explicit , even if in some cases complicate , function of the canonical coordinates . as a consequence",
    ", this geometrical approach provides a natural bridge between a dynamical and a thermodynamical description of the microcanonical ensemble . upon the remarks of the previous section , we are interested in understanding what can be inferred about thermodynamics by molecular dynamics experiments performed on hamiltonian models of the form ( 1 ) . as we have already stressed , in general such models",
    "are known not to be ergodic in a strictly mathematical sense . in this perspective",
    ", it could be hard to find out more appropriate probes for testing ergodicity , than such microcanonical thermodynamic observables .    in analogy with the rigorous approach of rugh , we assume ergodicity in order to guarantee that the microcanonical entropy @xmath12 is a well defined quantity associated to some hypervolume in phase space , equipped with a uniform undecomposable probability measure . in the @xmath13-canonical ensemble @xmath12 plays the role of a generalized thermodynamic potential from which any thermodynamic quantity can be obtained by derivations w.r.t .",
    "the physical parameters energy @xmath14 and volume @xmath8 : @xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is defined as the thermal expansion coefficient in the @xmath10-ensemble . in order to be correctly defined @xmath18 must fulfill the following properties :    * additivity ; * invariance under adiabatic reversible transformations ; * it must be a non - decreasing function for irreversible adiabatic transformations .",
    "two choices are possible for the @xmath10-ensemble : @xmath19 @xmath20 in these formulae we have set the boltzmann constant @xmath21 , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are arbitrary constants to make the argument of the logarithm dimensionless .",
    "definition @xmath24 includes all the microstates compatible with the constrain @xmath25 , i.e. those microstates belonging to the constant energy surface @xmath26 .",
    "alternatively , definition @xmath27 considers as microstates all those contained inside the hypervolume @xmath28 limited by @xmath29 .",
    "both definitions should be equivalent in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "let us recall that the phase - space @xmath30 is given the structure of a sympletic manifold by the fundamental symplectic two - form @xmath31 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath32 generates a vector field @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the fundamental symplectic matrix ) and an associated flux that preserves the liouville measure . for smooth potentials",
    "@xmath2 it seems reasonable to assume that @xmath35 is limited and that @xmath29 is smooth and connected .",
    "taking into account case @xmath24 , one can easily obtain an expression for the microcanonical temperature , that from here on we shall denote with @xmath36 , through the relation @xmath37 making use of a simple theorem of differential geometry one has @xmath38 the derivation and the full expression of this formula are reported in the appendix .",
    "analogously one can obtain an explicit formula for the specific heat per particle at constant volume @xmath39 by applying the differential geometry theorems reported in the appendix the following expression is obtained @xmath40    similarly , one can treat case @xmath27 .",
    "the temperature ( that from here on we denote @xmath41 , for reasons that will be clear in a moment ) can be obtained by introducing a vector @xmath42 , that has the property @xmath43 , and using the divergence theorem : [ tkin ] 1t_kin = se= = _ h = e_h <",
    "edx = _ h = e_h = ed = _ h = e_h = e x_ih x_i this is the usual expression deriving form the virial theorem @xmath44 that , for hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) and for @xmath45 , simplifies to @xmath46 i.e. the same expression that is obtained in the canonical ensemble .",
    "one could naively conclude that case @xmath27 should correspond to the canonical ensemble for any explicit expression of thermodynamic variables .",
    "clearly this is not the case , as one can easily conclude from the expression of the specific heat per particle @xmath47 notice that @xmath48 depends on the ratio between @xmath41 and @xmath36 , that is quite a different expression w.r.t .",
    "the corresponding canonical observable .",
    "in this section we study the dynamical and statistical properties of the microcanonical observables introduced in section ii .",
    "we consider the so - called fpu @xmath0-model , whose hamiltonian is of the form ( [ hamilton ] ) with @xmath49 we impose fixed boundary conditions , in such a way that the total energy @xmath14 is the only conserved quantity .",
    "all numerical experiments hereafter reported were performed with @xmath50 .",
    "( notice that this is not a prejudice of generality , since rescaling @xmath0 amounts to rescale @xmath14 ) .",
    "the integration of the equations of motion has been performed by a bilateral symplectic algorithm @xcite in double precision , with a time step @xmath51 , that guarantees the conservation of the energy at least on the sixth significative figure , for the considered range of energies .",
    "the running time average for an observable @xmath52 and the corresponding variance , computed over the whole time span , are defined as follows : f _ t= 1t_0^t f(p(t),q(t))dt [ mediat ] ( f ) = f^2 - f ^2f ^2 [ var ] numerical simulations typically have been performed over @xmath53 time steps , after a transient of @xmath54 time steps . since in the bilateral symplectic algorithm each time step amounts to @xmath55 , the total integration time in natural units is @xmath56 , that corresponds approximately to @xmath57 minimum harmonic periods of oscillations .",
    "we have considered different values of the energy density @xmath58 and , at fixed @xmath59 , different values of @xmath3 .",
    "let us first analyze the strongly chaotic regime that , according to the results of ref.s @xcite , should extend above @xmath60 . for the sake of space we report here only the running time averages of @xmath36 and @xmath41 for @xmath61 and for @xmath62 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "notice that both @xmath63 and @xmath64 approach an asymptotic value depending on @xmath3 : the former observable exhibits a fast convergence irrespectively of @xmath3 , while the latter is characterized by wild fluctuations that tend to weaken for increasing values of @xmath3 .",
    "averaging over many different initial conditions allows one for reducing such wild fluctuations and to extract more reliable estimates of the asymptotic values attained by @xmath64 .",
    "both `` temperatures '' are found to converge ( from below and from above , respectively ) to the same thermodynamic limit value ( @xmath65 ) with corrections of @xmath66 , as it should be expected on the basis of the ergodic theory ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we have also checked that the corresponding variances @xmath67 and @xmath68 scale both like @xmath69 thus showing that they are characterized by robust statistical properties .",
    "it is worth stressing that even for such a high value of @xmath59 the model is far from ergodic in a strictly mathematical sense @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "both temperatures seem to provide equally reliable thermodynamic predictions .",
    "we have verified that the same qualitative behaviour is observed for values of @xmath59 ranging in the interval ( 1 , 100 ) . on this basis",
    "one can state that , at least for high values of @xmath59 , the two definitions of temperature are thermodinamically ( even if not dynamically ) equivalent , while remarking that measurements of @xmath41 are much more efficient for any practical purpose .",
    "a very different scenario is obtained for @xmath70 , i.e. in the weakly chaotic regime . as an example , the running time averages of @xmath36 and @xmath41 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 are shown in fig .",
    "3 , for three different initial conditions . @xmath41",
    "still fastly relaxes to an asymptotic value independently of the initial condition .",
    "conversely , @xmath36 exhibits a dramatic dependence on the initial condition , despite its fluctuations are much less wild than in the strongly chaotic regime .",
    "the comparison between the two temperatures is quite illuminating .",
    "@xmath41 appears as a `` good '' thermodynamic observable that converges to its equilibrium value , irrespectively of ergodicity .",
    "in the perspective of the weak ergodic theorem by khinchin @xcite one would expect that at least the temporal autocorrelation function of @xmath41 decays to zero .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath36 clearly excludes this possibility , since its dependence on the initial conditions shows that the trajectories over which both quantities have been measured remain `` trapped '' for extremely long integration times in different regions of the phase space . as an illustration , in fig.s 4 a ,",
    "b we show the normalized temporal autocorrelation functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 of the dynamical observables defining the two temperatures , for @xmath71 and @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding power spectra clearly indicate that the dynamics amounts to a quasi - periodic motion with a few dominating harmonic components , whose frequencies and amplitudes depend on the initial conditions .",
    "if one looks at the explicit expressions for @xmath36 and @xmath41 this result appears much less mysterious : the former observable is sensitive to the geometry of the phase space ( mainly depending on @xmath8 ) through its explicit dipendence on the @xmath6 s , while the latter is sampled over the submanifold of the momenta @xmath7 s that makes it insensitive to any geometrical intricacy of the phase space ( a straightforward calculation shows that averaging @xmath41 over a quasiperiodic orbit yields the same prediction of equilibrium statistical mechanics ) .",
    "the measurement of @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the strongly chaotic regime provides additional elements of information , that confirm the previous conclusions and allow one for obtaining a quantitative characterization of the typical relaxation times of both temperatures to their equilibrium values . in all numerical simulations hereafter reported @xmath73 and @xmath74 have been averaged over @xmath76 initial conditions .",
    "typical results are shown in fig.s 4 c , d for @xmath61 and @xmath77 .",
    "both autocorrelation functions exhibit a fast exponential decay modulated by an oscillation that is rapidly damped for large times . at variance with @xmath74",
    ", @xmath73 presents also a typical `` hydrodynamic tail '' that superposes to the exponential decay at large values of @xmath78 .",
    "this shows that , even in the strongly chaotic regime , the two temperatures still exhibit quite different dynamical features that originate from their different geometrical nature , making them sensitive or insensitive to the geometrical structure of the phase space .    a systematic inspection in a wide range of @xmath79 in the strongly chaotic regime and for @xmath62 yields the following conclusions .",
    "the hull of the autocorrelation functions can be confidently fitted by the following laws c_kin(t)=e^-t/ _ 1 [ corrkin ] c_(t)=ae^-t/ _ 1 + 1-a1+t/ _ 2 [ corrmc ] where @xmath80 is the same for both quantities and results to be independent of @xmath3 , as well as",
    "@xmath81 , and @xmath24 is just a normalization constant .",
    "the main outcome of this analysis is that , when varying @xmath79 in the strongly chaotic regime , @xmath80 is found to obey the following remarkable scaling law _ 1 ( - _ c ) ^-1/2 [ scalaw ] with @xmath82 ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that this result allows to locate unambigously the sst of the fpu @xmath0-model at a specific value of the energy density that agrees with all the estimates obtained by the methods mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we want to observe that also @xmath81 is found to diverge at @xmath83 , altough the poor numerical accuracy in fitting the `` hydrodynamic '' decay of @xmath73 does not allow , in this case , to extract a clean scaling law .    the same analysis has been performed for the observables @xmath84 , @xmath48 and for the canonical specific heat per particle obtained in @xcite as a function of the microcanonical fluctuations of the total kinetic energy @xmath85 c_can ( 2 - n k^2 - k^2)^-1 [ ccan ] the running time averages of @xmath84 and @xmath86 exhibit behaviours very similar to those reported in fig . 1 for @xmath36 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "for the sake of space , in fig .",
    "6 we simply report the scaling with @xmath3 of the asymptotic values attained by @xmath84 and @xmath86 , that are found to converge to the same thermodynamic limit value @xmath87 .",
    "we have also looked at the temporal autocorrelation function of those observables , whose averages determine the expressions of the specific heats per particle . in practice ,",
    "the only new interesting quantity , with respect to those already considered in the study of the temperatures , is the numerator of the fraction in eq.([cvmu1 ] ) .",
    "we have verified that its autocorrelation functions coincide with those of @xmath36 for each value of @xmath59 .",
    "all these results indicate that these specific heats provide a scenario fully consistent with the temperatures analysis .    on the contrary",
    ", the running time averages of @xmath48 are characterized by extremely wild fluctuations , that do not show any tendency to a smooth approach to the expected thermodynamic limit value over available time spans .",
    "this fact definitely enforce the conclusion that relaxation mechanisms may strongly depend on the very nature of the observable at hand .",
    "upon assuming ergodicity , thermodynamic variables in the microcanonical ensemble can be explicitly written as dynamical quantities , by exploiting standard methods of differential geometry . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "they can be shown to coincide with the corresponding quantities obtained in the canonical and gran - canonical ensembles ( this can be easily checked at least for some basic quantities like temperature , specific heat etc . ) .",
    "on the other hand , many degrees of freedom hamiltonian systems are known not to be ergodic even at high energies @xcite . in particular , for sufficiently small energy densities such models exhibit quasi - periodic evolution along trajectories , that remain trapped inside some submanifold of the phase space for extremely long integration times .",
    "this peculiar dynamical feature is at the basis of the long - standing problem of `` ergodicity threshold '' raised by the celebrated paper of fpu @xcite  .",
    "an up to date summary of this problem is contained in the introduction .    in this paper",
    "we have pointed our attention on the fpu @xmath0-model , providing an unambiguous description of the strong stochasticity threshold .",
    "this was obtained using the previously mentioned microcanonical observables as probes of ergodicity . in particular , this analysis allowed us for locating the sst at a finite value of the energy density @xmath88 , that results to be independent of @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth stressing that this value agrees with rougher estimates still originating from the study of `` geometrical '' observables @xcite .",
    "moreover , the comparison with the corresponding canonical observables allows us for concluding that the crucial point about the ergodic hypothesis concerns the very nature of the observable and not just the features of the dynamics .",
    "such a point of view was already raised by khinchin @xcite , although we have shown that it may exist thermodynamic observables ( like @xmath41 and @xmath86 ) that converge to the predictions of equilibrium statistical mechanics even when time averages are performed over highly non - chaotic evolutions , where the `` weak ergodic theorem '' by khinchin does not certainly apply .",
    "let us finally observe that one can obtain other different dynamical expression for microcanonical observables by proper choices of the coordinates space representation .",
    "the only constraint for such a choice is to maintain invariant the flux through the constant energy surface .",
    "for instance , in case b , one could choose the vector @xmath89 , in such a way that the temperature depends also on the @xmath6 coordinates .",
    "this arbitrariness , obviously , does not affect thermodynamic limit properties , since all expressions for the same observables coincide , while , dynamically , the scenario should not change significantly with respect to the one described in section iii .",
    "nonetheless a detailed investigation of these different choices can provide a deeper insight on the way `` statistical fluctuations '' can be consistently introduced in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this point goes beyond the aims of this paper and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we are indebted with h.h .",
    "rugh , m. pettini , s. lepri , l. casetti , r. franzosi , a. franchi , m. peyrard and t. dauxois for useful discussions and comments .",
    "we want to thank i.s.i . in torino for the kind hospitality during the workshop of the eu hc@xmath90 m network erb - chrx - ct940546 on `` complexity and chaos '' , where part of this work was performed .      in this appendix",
    "we report a simple theorem of differential geometry that allows to express the derivatives of the entropy w.r.t .",
