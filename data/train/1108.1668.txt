    "precisely because of its capability of covering a wide region of the sky , its normal mode of operation is surveying , which facilitates serendipitous discoveries and simultaneous observations of many sources .",

    "_ integral _ ( winkler et al .",
    "2003 ) is optimized to work between 15 kev10 mev .",

    "2003 ) . at the lower energies ( 15 kev1 mev )",
    ", the cadmium telluride array isgri ( lebrun et al . 2003 ) of ibis has a better continuum sensitivity than spi below @xmath8 kev .",
    "the _ integral _ observations were carried out per pointing , called as individual science windows ( scws ) , with a typical time duration of about 2000 s each .",
    "the data reduction was performed by using the standard online science analysis ( osa ) , version 9.0 .",
    "the results were obtained by running the pipeline from the raw to the image level . in this analysis ,",
    "only ibis / isgri public data are taken into account .",
    "the available integral observations when 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 had offset angle less than 14@xmath9 comprise about 2014 scws , adding up to a total exposure time of 5.78 ms .",
    "our dataset covers rev .",
    "30867 , from 2003 - 01 - 11 to 2009 - 11 - 20 ( mjd 52650 - 55155 ) .",
    "this large amount of data allow for an in - depth investigation on the hard x - ray emission from 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 .",
    "an _ integral _ detection of 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 is derived from combining all the isgri data , with a significance level of 5.4@xmath0 and an average intensity of 0.074 counts s@xmath1 in the 1840 kev band .",
    "1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 is also consistently detected in the 1860 kev ; its map significance is reduced only to a fluctuation at higher energies .",
    "we only obtain 1.63@xmath0 in the 40100 kev .",
    "the significance and flux measurement of 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 are obtained from the pixel comprising the most prominent position determined by _",
    "swift_-xrt ( corbet et al . 2011 ) , which is within _",
    "fermi_-lat 1fgl and 2fgl error circle .",
    "the pixel size of _ integral _ is about 4.93 arcmin @xmath10 4.93 arcmin , whereas the uncertainty in position of _ fermi _ , i.e. , the 95% confidence radius is @xmath31.76 arcmin and is thus fully included in the pixel used for our significance estimation .",
    "however , we would like to notice that the source significance should be taken with care . the pixel significance distribution of each 18 - 40 kev map has a gaussian shape with a width parameter , instead of 1 as expected from a purely statistical dominated image , of about 1.1 , which may due to an unknown systematic error .",
    "typically , systematic noise is produced from being close to the very bright sources and or very crowded regions .",
    "as more maps from different observations are combined , the width parameter increases and finally reaches up to 1.4 for all data considered .",
    "thus , we find that there is a non - statistical noise in the image that effectively reduces the significance to 5.4/1.4 , or about 4@xmath0 . given the spatial coincidence of the source with 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856   we can claim a detection at 99.9937 % , or alternatively , that the probability of a chance coincidence is of the order @xmath3 @xmath11 .",
    "if we assume ( although there is no a prior reason to , and we caveat that this is just done for estimation to an order of magnitude ) that the spectral shape of 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856  is same with that of the crab nebula in the corresponding energy range ( a power - law with @xmath122.14 ) , a flux of 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856  is derived as @xmath13 erg @xmath14 s@xmath1 , or about 0.35 mcrab in flux units . if we instead assume that the spectrum of 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856  is similar to that of ls 5039  at inferior conjunction passage as given by hoffmann et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we would obtain 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856   flux of about @xmath15 erg @xmath14 s@xmath1 , or a factor of 0.23 of the ls 5039 flux . the neighboring source gro j1008 - 57 , 1.36@xmath16 away from 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 is detected with a significance of @xmath17 and with an intensity of 4.2 mcrab .",
    "it likely constitutes a problem for the analysis of 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856  with non - imaging detectors .",
    ".exposure times and obtained significance for the whole _ integral _ observation ( all phase bins ) and separated in orbital bins . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ expo - hard ]    since 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856  is much weaker than other neighboring sources in its crowded sky region , it is impossible for osa 9.0 to derive a lightcurve directly out of the standard reduction procedure .",
    "however , one can combine the images from different science windows based on orbital phase - bins and , via inferring the flux from each of the combined image , produce an orbital lightcurve manually . thus , to see how 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856  varies along its 16.58 days orbit",
    ", we divide the _",
    "integral _ data into phase bins .",
    "the reference time at phase zero is set to the peak flux that observed by _ fermi - lat _ at @xmath18 days , as reported at gev energies in corbet et al .",
    "we show the _ integral _ results on 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 for each phase bin in table [ expo - hard ] , where the flux , the corresponding exposure and the significance are provided . again , given that the pixel distribution has a gaussian width of about 1.34 in each of the images ( see table [ expo - hard ] ) , we conservatively consider that the significance should be lowered by this factor",
    ". hinted from table 1 is a trend of having an anti - correlation between the hard x - ray emission and the _ fermi_-lat periodicity .",
    "actually , we find that a significant portion of the signal comes only from a 0.2-wide phase region , at phases 0.40.6 ( where even the corrected significance amounts to about 90% of the signal found in total )",
    ". however , the scarcity of counts makes it difficult to have a definitive proof of the variability : a constant fit to the count rate yields a reduced @xmath19 of 14.09/4 , suggesting that the significance of variability is at 99.64% , or only 2.7@xmath0 level .    though it is impossible to derive a lightcurve from standard reduction procedure , we could read pixels corresponding to 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 position and derived a light curve manually . to search for a periodic signal in the light curve data",
    ", we used the lomb ",
    "scargle periodogram method .",
    "power spectrum is generated for the light curve using the period subroutine ( press & rybicki 1989 ) .",
    "no significant signal is seen at an orbit period of 16.58 days beyond 90% white  noise confidence level .",
    "this is consistent with having only an overall weak detection of the source in our imaging analysis and the orbit modulation is not apparent in lightcurve .",
    "we have carried out an analysis of all _ integral _ data available to 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 , a new gamma - ray binary with a period of @xmath3 16.5 days discovered blindly by means of a power spectrum analysis of _ fermi_-lat detection ( 100 mev200 gev ) .",
    "the total effective exposure extracted on the source from the archive amounts to 5.78 ms , and leads to a credible detection of the source at hard x - rays ( 1840 kev ) .",
    "the count rate is however very low , preventing from extracting strong conclusions about orbital variability , although it is hinted with an anti - correlation with the gamma - ray emission detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat in 100 mev  200 gev .",
    "in fact , 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 seems to significantly show up only during a small part of its orbital evolution , far from the gamma - ray maximum at 100 mev200 gev .",
    "this would represent a more marked distinction with respect to what was obtained in the case of ls  i  + 61@xmath20303  which presents a displacement of the maximum between hard x - rays ( by _ integral _ ) and gamma - rays ( by _ fermi_-lat and magic ) , without being completely anti - correlated ( zhang et al .",
    "instead this is in line with the results for ls 5039 ( see , e.g. , hoffman et al . 2009 ) where the hard x - ray emission as measured with _",
    "integral _ is correlated with the tev emission measured with hess ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ) , and thus it is fully anti - correlated with the gev emission as measured by _",
    "fermi_-lat ( abdo et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the case of 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 appears as another incarnation of this behavior , albeit with the conservative caveat of yet a low significance for an strong claim the maximum count rate of 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 is about five times lower than that of ls 5039 , emphasizing a possible physical similarity of the two sources .",
    "tev observations at what appears to be the maximum of the hard x - ray lightcurve are thus encouraged .",
