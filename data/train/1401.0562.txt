    "the portfolio optimization problem , first analyzed within a continuous time model in @xcite , ignores two key features that are important for investment decisions , namely transaction costs and uncertain volatility .",
    "both these issues complicate the analysis of the expected utility maximization stochastic control problem , and obtaining closed - form optimal policies , or even numerical approximations , is challenging due to the increase in dimension by incorporating a stochastic volatility variable , and the singular control problem that arises by considering proportional transaction costs . here , we develop asymptotic approximations for a particular long - run investment goal in a model with transaction costs _ and _ stochastic volatility .",
    "the typical problem has an investor who can invest in a market with one riskless asset ( a money market account ) , and one risky asset ( a stock ) , and who has to pay a transaction cost for selling the stock .",
    "the costs are proportional to the dollar amount of the sale , with proportionality constant @xmath0 .",
    "the investment goal is to maximize the long - term growth rate .",
    "the original works all assumed stocks with constant volatility .",
    "transaction costs were first introduced into the merton portfolio problem by @xcite and later further investigated by @xcite .",
    "their analysis of the infinite time horizon investment and consumption problem gives an insight into the optimal strategy and the existence of a _  no - trade \" _",
    "( nt ) region . under certain assumptions , @xcite provided the first rigorous analysis of the same infinite time horizon problem .",
    "these assumptions were weakened by @xcite , who used viscosity solutions to also show the smoothness of the value function .",
    "when @xmath0 , and the volatility is constant , the optimal policy is to trade as soon as the position is sufficiently far away from the merton proportion .",
    "more specifically , the agent s optimal policy is to maintain her position inside a nt region .",
    "if the investor s position is initially outside the nt region , she should immediately sell or buy stock in order to move to its boundary .",
    "she will trade only when her position is on the boundary of the nt region , and only as much as necessary to keep it from exiting the nt region , while no trading occurs in the interior of the region ; see @xcite .",
    "there is a trade - off between the amount of transaction costs paid due to portfolio rebalancing and the width of the nt region .",
    "a smaller nt region generally increases the amount spent paying transaction costs in maintaining the optimal portfolio .",
    "not surprisingly , the same behavior persists when volatility is stochastic , but in this case , the boundaries of nt region in general will no longer be straight lines as before .",
    "hence , the approach of this paper , is to find a simple strategy that will be asymptoticaly optimal in both the volatility scaling and transaction costs parameters .",
    "small transaction cost asymptotic expansions ( in powers of @xmath1 ) were used in @xcite for an infinite horizon investment and consumption problem .",
    "this approach allows them to find approximations to the optimal policy and the optimal long - term growth rate , and is also used in @xcite for a finite horizon optimal investment problem .",
    "the survey article @xcite describes recent results using so - called _ shadow price _ to obtain small transaction cost asymptotics for the optimal investment policy , its implied welfare , liquidity premium , and trading volume .",
    "all of the above mentioned literature on transaction costs assumes constant volatility .",
    "some recents exceptions are @xcite , where the stock is a general it diffusion , and @xcite where the stock is described by a complete ( local volatility ) model .",
    "we summarize some of this literature and the individual optimization problems and models that they study in table [ tab : t1 ] .",
    "our approach exploits the fast mean - reversion of volatility ( particularly when viewed over a long investment horizon ) leading to a singular perturbation analysis of an impulse control problem .",
    "we treat the case , when the volatility is slow mean reverting separately .",
    "this complements multiscale approximations developed for derivatives pricing problems described in @xcite and for optimal hedging and investment problems in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "recently , @xcite study indifference pricing of european options with exponential utility , fast mean - reverting stochastic volatility and small transaction costs which scale with the volatility time scale .",
    "the current transaction cost problem can be characterized as a free - boundary problem .",
    "the fast mean - reversion asymptotics for the finite horizon free boundary problem arising from american options pricing was developed in @xcite , and recently there has been interest in similar analysis for perpetual ( infinitely - lived ) american options ( used as part of a real options model ) in @xcite , and for a structural credit risk model in @xcite . here , we also have an infinite horizon free - boundary problem , but it is , in addition , an eigenvalue problem .    in section [ sec : model ] of this paper , we introduce our model and objective function and give the associated hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation . in section [ sec : asymptotic ] we perform the asymptotic analysis .",
    "we first consider the fast - scale stochastic volatility in section [ sec : buildsol ] , where we find the first correction term in the power expansion of the value function , and as a result also find the corresponding term in the power expansion of the optimal boundary .",
    "we perform similar analysis in the case of slow - scale stochastic volatility in section [ sec : buildsolslow ] . in section [ sec : results ] we show numerical calculations based on our results , and give an alternative intuitive explanation to the findings .",
    "we summarize the results obtained in the paper in section [ sec : conclusion ] , and leave some technical computations to the appendix .",
    "an investor can allocate capital between two assets  a risk - free money market account with constant rate of interest @xmath2 , and risky stock @xmath3 that evolves according to the following stochastic volatility model : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are brownian motions , defined on a filtered probability space @xmath7 , with constant correlation coefficient @xmath8 : @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is a smooth , bounded and strictly positive function , and that the stochastic volatility factor @xmath11 is a fast mean - reverting process , meaning that the parameter @xmath12 is small , and that @xmath13 is an ergodic process with a unique invariant distribution @xmath14 that is independent of @xmath15 .",

    "* chapter 3 ) for further technical details and discussion .",
    "additionally @xmath16 are positive constants , and @xmath17 are smooth functions : examples will be specified later for computations .      the investor must choose a policy consisting of two adapted processes @xmath18 and @xmath19 that are nondecreasing and right - continuous with left limits , and @xmath20 . the control @xmath21 represents the cumulative dollar value of stock purchased up to time @xmath22 , while @xmath23 is the cumulative dollar value of stock sold .",
    "then , the wealth @xmath24 invested in the money market account and the wealth @xmath25 invested in the stock follow @xmath26 the constant @xmath27 represents the proportional transaction costs for selling the stock .",
    "next , we define the _ solvency region _",
    "@xmath28 which is the set of all positions , such that if the investor were forced to liquidate immediately , she would not be bankrupt .",
    "this leads to a definition that a policy @xmath29 is _ admissible _ for the initial position @xmath30 and @xmath31 starting at time @xmath32 , if @xmath33 is in the closure of solvency region , @xmath34 , for all @xmath35 .",

    "let @xmath37 the set of all such policies . clearly ,",
    "if @xmath38 then we can always liquidate the position , and then hold the resulting cash position in the risk - free money market account .",
    "it is easy to adapt the proof in @xcite ( for the constant volatility case ) to show that @xmath39 if and only if @xmath40    we work with crra or power utility functions @xmath41 defined on @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the constant relative risk aversion parameter .",

    "this choice of optimization problem ensures the simplest hjb equation , which in this case turns out to be linear and time independent .",
    "consider first the value function for utility maximization at a finite time horizon @xmath52 : @xmath53}.\\ ] ] from it s formula it follows that @xmath54 since @xmath55 must be a supemartingale , the @xmath56 and @xmath57 terms must not be positive .",
    "it follows that @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath60 we will define the no - trade ( @xmath61 ) region , associated with @xmath55 , to be the region where both of these inequalities are strict .",
    "moreover , for the optimal strategy , @xmath55 is a martingale , and so the @xmath62 term above must be zero inside the @xmath63 region .",
    "thus it will then satisfy the hjb equation @xmath64 where @xmath65 the fact that @xmath55 is a viscosity solution of is standard , and a similar proof can be found for example in @xcite , and thus will be omitted here .",
    "we will furthermore assume that the viscosity solution @xmath55 of is in fact a classical solution , that is we will assume that it is sufficiently smooth .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath55 is smooth inside each of three regions : the @xmath61 , and the regions where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the assumption that it is also smooth on the _ boundary _ of the @xmath61 is the smooth fit assumption , which is very common ; see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "next , we look for a solution of the hjb equation of the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant , and the function @xmath70 is to be found .",
    "however , we will not impose the final time condition on @xmath71 .",
    "for now , we will only assume that it is smooth and @xmath72 is bounded away from zero .",
    "we will define the nt region ( associated with @xmath71 ) as the region where @xmath73 additionally , we will assume that for any point @xmath74 in the nt region , the ratio @xmath75 is bounded .",
    "we note that @xmath71 is not equivalent to the value function @xmath55 , since we have not imposed the final time condition @xmath76 in fact there is no reason to believe that the final time condition can be satisfied if @xmath71 is given by .",
    "however , if we find a constant @xmath77 such that @xmath78 , then it would follow that @xmath69 is the optimal growth rate and the nt region for the long - term optimal growth problem can be defined as the region where @xmath73 in other words , @xmath79    we will now show that there exists a constant @xmath77 such that @xmath78 . indeed ,",
    "note that the utility function @xmath80 is homogeneous of degree @xmath81 , that is @xmath82 , it follows that @xmath83 by our assumption , @xmath84 is bounded , being inside the nt region .",
    "hence , there exists a constant @xmath77 such that @xmath85 since both @xmath71 and @xmath55 solve the hjb equation , it follows by a comparison theorem that @xmath78 everywhere . for the reader convenience",
    ", we have sketched the proof of it in appendix [ sec : comparisonthm ] .",
    "inserting the transformation into leads to the following equation for @xmath86 : @xmath87 where we define the operators in the nt region by @xmath88 and the buy and sell operators by @xmath89 respectively . for future reference",
    ", we also define their derivatives @xmath90      we will look for a solution to the variational inequality in the following free - boundary form .",
    "the nt region is defined by , but for the function @xmath71 .",
    "using the transformation , this translates to @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "similar to the case with constant volatility , we assume that there exists a no - trade region , within which @xmath93 with boundaries @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we write this region as @xmath96 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are free boundaries to be found . in typical parameter regimes",
    ", we will have @xmath97 , so we can think of them as lower and upper boundaries respectively , with @xmath98 being the buy boundary , and @xmath99 the sell boundary .",
    "( the other two possibilities are that @xmath100 with @xmath98 being the buy boundary , and @xmath99 the sell boundary , or that @xmath100 with @xmath98 being the sell boundary , and @xmath99 the buy boundary . under a constant volatility model these cases",
    "can be categorized explicitly in term of the model parameters : see remark [ rem : cases ] ) .",
    "inside this region we have from the hjb equation that @xmath101 the free boundaries @xmath98 and @xmath99 are determined by continuity of the first and second derivatives of @xmath102 with respect to @xmath103 , that is looking for a @xmath104 solution . in the buy region ,",
    "@xmath105 and so the smooth pasting conditions at the lower boundary are @xmath106 in the sell region , the transaction cost enters and we have : @xmath107 therefore the sell boundary conditions are : @xmath108    we note that , and are homogeneous equations with homogeneous boundary conditions , , and , and so zero is a solution .",
    "however the constant @xmath69 is also to be determined , and in fact it is an eigenvalue found to exclude the trivial solution and give the optimal long - term growth rate . in the next section , we construct an asymptotic expansion in @xmath15 for this eigenvalue problem using these equations .",
    "we look for an expansion for the value function @xmath109 as well as for the free boundaries @xmath110 and the optimal long - term growth rate @xmath111 which are asymptotic as @xmath112 .",

    "* section 3.2 ) for technical details .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the differential operators @xmath118 in terms of which the operators @xmath119 and @xmath120 in are @xmath121 in the following , a key role will be played by the squared - averaged volatility @xmath122 defined by @xmath123 the principal terms in the expansions will be related to the _ constant volatility _ transaction costs problem , and we define the operator @xmath124 that acts in the no trade region by @xmath125 and it is written as a function of the parameters @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",

    "the reason for such vastly different @xmath15 in all the cases , is the desire to have the @xmath307 approximation to be close to the original boundaries .",
    "we observe that the effect of stochastic volatility is to shift both the buy and the sell boundaries down .",

    "even if the current position is @xmath364 away from the boundary , then in the time it takes the wealth ratio @xmath365 to reach the boundary , the volatility factor will have changed by @xmath366 .",
    "hence , even at such close proximity to the boundary , the current volatility factor level is not important . what important is the average of the variance @xmath367 .",
    "hence , in case of fast - scale stochastic volatility , only the average level @xmath122 plays a role .",
    "the situation is , of course , not analogous in the slow - scale case , where the current level is extremely important . as intuitively , we can use the same level of volatility factor , for a significant amount of time , with insignificant measurement error .",
    "intuitively , the effect of stochastic volatility should reduce ( or at least not increase ) the long - term growth rate @xmath69 , at least for small correlation @xmath368 , the intuition coming from jensen s inequality .",
    "indeed , @xmath369 & = \\e^{x , y , z}_0\\left[\\e\\left [ \\u\\left(x_t+y_t-\\lam y_t^{+}\\right)\\big| \\mathcal f^{b^2 } \\right]\\right]\\\\ & \\le \\e^{x , y , z}_0\\left [ \\u\\left(\\e\\left[x_t+y_t-\\lam y_t^{+}\\big| \\mathcal f^{b^2 } \\right]\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the right hand side , for @xmath370 , is approximately the total wealth using the average volatility @xmath122 , in case of fast - scale volatility , and the the total wealth using the initial volatility level @xmath132 in the slow - scale volatility .",
    "hence , we expect @xmath371 in those cases .",
    "it turns out however that the first order effect in case @xmath370 is zero .",
    "this is clear from the calculations , specifically , , , , that @xmath372 , and @xmath373 and thus so are @xmath167 and @xmath174 from and , since all the terms are proportional to @xmath368 .",
    "this effect has been observed by @xcite .    additionally , if @xmath374 , as is typically observed in the equity markets , the effect should be tighter nt region , and lower boundaries , than in case of constant volatility . the intuition here",
    "being that if the stock price goes up , the current volatility should be lower , while keeping the average volatility unchanged .",
    "this will cause the investor to start selling earlier .",
    "similarly , when stock price goes down , the current volatility will tend to decrease , this will cause the investor to start buying later .",
    "additionally , since the volatility will be quick to return to it s average value , these changes would not be symmetric , and the width of the nt region will decrease .",
    "these changes can be observed in the following graphs too , especially in graphs of the boundaries as a function of @xmath375 in the the upper left of the graphs in figures [ fig : fast - real ] , [ fig : fast - complex ] , [ fig : slow - real ] , [ fig : slow - complex ] .",
    "we observe , that in all the cases the approximation does not differ much , from the original boundaries , as long as we re sufficiently away from the case when merton s proportion @xmath376 in this case , it is known that the nt region degenerates , as it is optimal to trade only once , and invest all the wealth into the risky stock . in this cases , because the boundaries @xmath377 are positive , and increase to @xmath378 as the merton s optimal proportion approaches one .",
    "additionally , both @xmath167 , and @xmath290 are negative , and they converge to @xmath379 as the merton s optimal proportion approaches one . finally , it appears that the speed of the convergence of @xmath167 , and @xmath290 is faster than that of @xmath163 and @xmath177 .",
    "hence , overall the approximation and the original boundaries cross each other before diverging . even though , for any fixed @xmath380 the approximation would be very close to the original boundary , if @xmath12 is taken to be small enough .",
    "this is another reason why we have used different @xmath15 between the cases in the fast - scale and the slow - scale stochastic volatility . as the behaviors of the graphs",
    "is very different in the slow- and fast - scale cases and in the real and imaginary @xmath247 , as the merton s proportion approaches one .",
    "the change to the equivalent safe rate from @xmath196 to @xmath356 exhibit more stability .",
    "in fact , it is almost a parallel shift down , in case of fast - scale stochastic volatility .",
    "however , in certain cases , specifically in fast - scale stochastic volatility , with complex roots @xmath247 we see that the approximation can be greater , then the original equivalent safe rate @xmath196 .",
    "this seems to be the case , because the shift is almost , but not entirely parallel , and with approximation term @xmath175 changes signs . for small drift @xmath375 and for large @xmath122",
