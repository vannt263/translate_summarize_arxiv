    "since its the discovery of interlayer exchange coupling @xcite , this phenomenon has stimulated a number theoretical investigations .",
    "various approaches have used .",
    "these are :    * the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) model @xcite ; * the free - electron model @xcite ; * the hole confinement model @xcite ; * the anderson ( or @xmath0-mixing ) model @xcite ; * _ ab initio _ calculations @xcite .    the mechanism which now widely accepted for the iec is based upon quantum intereferences in the spacer layer due to spin - dependent confinement @xcite .",
    "these lecture notes are organized as follows . in ,",
    "section  i , the quantum interences due to confinement are discussed , and it is shown how this yields an oscillatory interlayer exchange coupling . in section  ii , the theoretical basis of the one - electron approach of section",
    "i is presented . finally , in section  iii",
    ", the effect of substitutional disorder is addressed .",
    "the purpose of this section is to present as simply as possible the mechanism of interlayer exchange coupling in terms of quantum interferences due to electron confinement in the spacer layer",
    ". the emphasis here will be on physical concepts rather than on mathematical rigor .",
    "this discussion is based on the one given in ref .",
    "@xcite .      for the sake of clarity",
    ", we shall first consider an extremely simplified model , namely the one - dimensional quantum well , which nevertheless contains the essential physics involved in the problem .",
    "then , we shall progressively refine the model in order to make it more realistic .",
    "the model consists in a one - dimensional quantum well representing the spacer layer ( of potential @xmath1 and width @xmath2 ) , sandwiched between two `` barriers '' @xmath3 and @xmath4 of respective widths @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and respective potentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "note that we use the term `` barrier '' in a general sense , i.e. , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are not necessarily positive .",
    "furthermore , the barrier widths , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , can be infinite .",
    "let us consider an electron of wavevector @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 ) propagating to the right in the spacer layer ; as this electrons arrives on barrier @xmath4 , it is partially reflected to the left , with a ( complex ) anplitude @xmath11 is in turn reflected on barrier @xmath3 with an amplitude @xmath12 , an so on .",
    "the module @xmath13 of the reflection coefficient expresses the magnitude of the reflected wave , whereas the argument @xmath14 represents the phase shift due to the reflection ( note that the latter is not absolutely determined and depends on the choice of the coodinate origin ) .",
    "the interferences between the waves due to the multiple reflections on the barriers induce a modification of the density of states in the spacer layer , for the electronic state under consideration .",
    "the phase shift resulting from a complete round trip in the spacer is @xmath15 with @xmath16 if the interferences are constructive , i.e. , if @xmath17 with @xmath18 an integer , one has an increase of the density of states ; conversely , if the interferences are destructive , i.e. , if @xmath19 one has a reduction of the density of states .",
    "thus , in a first approximation , we expect the modification of the density of states in the spacer , @xmath20 , to vary with @xmath2 like @xmath21 furthermore , we expect that this effect will proportional to the amplitude of the reflections on barriers @xmath3 and @xmath4 , i.e. , to @xmath22 ; finally , @xmath20 must be proportional to the width @xmath2 of the spacer and to the density of states per unit energy and unit width , @xmath23 which includes a factor of @xmath24 for spin degenaracy .",
    "we can also include the effect of higher order interferences due to @xmath18 round trips in the spacer ; the phase shift @xmath25 is then multiplied by @xmath18 and @xmath22 is replaced by @xmath26 .",
    "gathering all the terms , we get , @xmath27 as will appear clealy below , it is more convenient to consider the integrated density of states @xmath28 the modification @xmath29 of the intergated density of states due to electron confinement is @xmath30 a simple graphical interpretation of the above expression can be obtained by noting that @xmath31 , for @xmath32 complex ; thus , @xmath33 is given by the argument , in complex plane , of a point located at an angle @xmath34 on a circle of radius @xmath22 centred in 1 . this graphical construction is shown in [ fig : graphic ] .",
    "the variation of @xmath33 as a function of @xmath2 is shown in [ fig : deltan ] , for various values of the confinement strength @xmath22 . for weak confinement ( a )",
    ", @xmath33 varies with @xmath2 in sinusoidal manner .",
    "as one increases the confinement strength ( b ) , the oscillations are distorded , due to higher order interferences .",
    "finally , for full confinement ( c ) , @xmath33 exhibits some jumps that correspond to the bound states .",
    "we note however , that the period @xmath35 of the oscillations of @xmath36 does not depend on the confinement strength , but only on the wavevector @xmath37 , namely , @xmath38 .",
    "so far , we have implicitely restricted ourselves to positive energy states .",
    "negative energy states ( i.e. , of imaginary wavevector ) are forbidden in absence of the barriers @xmath3 and @xmath4 , because their amplitude diverges either on the right hand side or on the left hand side , so that they can not be normalized .",
    "this matter of fact no longer holds in the presence of the barriers if @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 or both ) is negative : the negative energy states , i.e. , varying exponentially in the spacer , can be connected to allowed states of @xmath3 or @xmath4 . in order to treat these states consistently",
    ", we simply have to extend the concept of reflection coefficient to to states of imaginary wavevector , which is straightforward .",
    "one can check that , with this generalization , [ eq : th : deltan ] acounts properly for the contribution of the evanescent states .",
    "physically , this can be interpretated as a coupling of @xmath3 and @xmath4 by tunnel effect .",
    "let us now study the modification of the energy of the system due to the quantum interferences . in order to conserve the total number of electron , it is convenient to work within the grand - canonical ensemble , and to consider the thermodynamic grand - potential , which is given by @xmath39 \\ ,   n(\\varepsilon ) \\ , { { \\rm d}}\\varepsilon \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } n(\\varepsilon ) \\ , f(\\varepsilon)\\ ,   { { \\rm d}}\\varepsilon .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at @xmath40 , this reduces to @xmath41",
    "the energy @xmath42 associated with the interferences is the contribution to @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath33 , @xmath44      the generalization of the above discussion to the more realistic case of a three - dimensional layered system is immediate . since the system is invariant by translation parallely to the plane , so that the in - plane wavevector @xmath45 is a good quantum number .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath45 , one has an effective one - dimensional problem analogous to the one discussed above .",
    "the resulting effect of quantum intereferences is obtained by summing over @xmath45 .",
    "the modification of integrated density of states per unit area is @xmath46 and the coupling energy per unit area is @xmath47      the case of a thin overlayer deposited on a substrate is of considerable interest . in this case ,",
    "one of the barriers ( say , @xmath3 ) consists of the vacuum , and barrier @xmath4 is constituted by the substrate itself .",
    "the potential of the vacuum barrier is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the the work function ; thus it is perfectly reflecting for occupied states , i.e. , @xmath50 . on the other hand ,",
    "the reflection on the substrate ( or coefficent @xmath51 ) may be total or partial , depending on the state under consideration .",
    "the spectral density of the occupied states in the overlayer can be investigated experimentally by photoemission spectroscopy ; in addition , by using inverse photoemission , one can study the unoccupied states .",
    "if furthermore these techniques are used in the `` angle - resolved '' mode , they give information on the spectral density _ locally in the @xmath45 plane_.    for a given thickness of the overlayer , the photoemission spectra ( either direct or inverse ) exhibit some maxima and minima corresponding , respectively , to the energies for which the interferences are constructive and destructive .",
    "when the confinement is total , narrow peaks can be observed , which correspond to the quantized confined states in the overlayer , as was pointed out by loly and pendry @xcite .",
    "quantum size effects due to electron confinement in the photoemission spectra of overlayers have been observed in various non - magnetic systems @xcite in particular , the systems au(111)/ag / vacuum and cu(111)/ag / vacuum offer excellent examples of this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "so far our discussion concerned exclusively non - magnetic systems .",
    "qualitatively new behavior can be expected some of the layers are ferromagnetic .",
    "case of particular interest is the one of a paramagnetic overlayer on a ferromagnetic substrate .    in the interior of the overlayer ,",
    "the potential is independent of the spin ; therefore the propagation of electrons is described by a wave vector @xmath52 which is spin - independent .",
    "the reflection coefficient on the vacuum barrier , @xmath53 , is also spin - independent .",
    "however , the ferromagnetic substrate constitutes a spin - dependent potential barrier ; thus , the substrate reflection coefficients for electrons with a spin parallel to the majority and minority spin directions of the substrate , respectively @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "it is convenient to define the spin average @xmath56 and the spin asymmetry @xmath57 in this case , the electron confinement in the overlayer gives rise to a spin - dependent modulation of the spectral density versus overlayer thickness ; the period of the modulation is the same for both spins , whereas the amplitude and phase are expected to be spin - dependent .",
    "the quantum size effects in paramagnetic overlayers on a ferromagnetic substrate have been investigated by several groups @xcite .",
    "the systems studied most are cu overlayers on a co(001 ) substrate and ag overlayers on a fe(001 ) substrate .",
    "ortega and himpsel @xcite observed a quantum size effect in the normal - emission photoelectron spectra of copper overlayer on fcc cobalt ( 001 ) substrate .",
    "they observed peaks due to quantum size effects both in the photoemission and in the inverse photoemission spectra an oscillation of the photoemission intensity .",
    "these quantum size effects manifest themselves also by an oscillatory behavior of the photoemission intensity at the fermi level ; as the observed oscillation period ( 5.9  atomic layers ) is close to the long period of interlayer exchange coupling oscillations in co / cu(001)/co , they pointed out that the two phenomena are related to each other ; they also claimed that the observed oscillations in photoemission are spin dependent and due mostly to minority electrons .",
    "a direct confirmation of this conjecture has been given independently by garrison _",
    "_ @xcite and by carbone _",
    "_ @xcite by means of spin - polarized photoemission .",
    "they found that both the intensity and the spin - polarization exhibit an oscillatory behavior with the same period ( 5  6 atomic layers ) , but they have opposit phases , which indicates that the quantum size effect does indeed take place predominantly in the minority - spin band as proposed by ortega and himpsel @xcite .",
    "recently , klsges _",
    "@xcite have observed spin - polarized quantum size effects in a copper overlayer on cobalt ( 001 ) for a non - zero in - plane wave vector corresponding to the short period oscillation of interlayer exchange coupling in co / cu(001)/co ; they observed short period oscillations of the photoemission intensity in good agrement with the short period oscillations of interlayer coupling .",
    "this observation provides a further confirmation of the relation between quantum size effects in photoemission and oscillation of interlayer exchange coupling .",
    "photoemission studies of quantum size effects have also been performed in other kinds of systems such as ferromagnetic overlayer on a non - magnetic substrate , or systems comprising more layers @xcite .",
    "photoemission spectroscopy undoubtly constitutes a method of choice for investigating quantum size effects in metallic overlayers : this is due to its unique features , which allow selectivity in energy , in - plane wave vector , and spin .    besides photemission , spin - polarized quantum size effects in paramagnetic overlayers on a ferromagnetic substrate are also responsible for oscillatory behavior ( versus overlayer thickness ) of spin - polarized secondary electron emission @xcite , linear @xcite and non - linear @xcite magneto - optical kerr , and magnetic anisotropy @xcite .",
    "however , these effects usually involve a summation over all electronic states , so that the quantitative analysis of the quantum size effects may be fairly complicated .",
    "let us now consider the case of a paramagnetic layer sandwiched between two ferromagnetic barriers @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "now , the reflection coefficients on both sides of the paramagnetic spacer layer are spin dependent .",
    "_ a priori _ the angle @xmath58 between the magnetizations of the two ferromagnetic can take any value ; however , for the sake of simplicity , we shall restrict ourselves here to the ferromagnetic ( f ) configuration ( ie . , @xmath59 ) and the antiferromagnetic ( af ) one ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) .    for the ferromagnetic configuration",
    ", the energy per unit area due to quantum interference is easily obtained from [ eq : th : qse - energy-3d ] , i.e. , @xmath61 \\ , { { \\rm d}}\\varepsilon \\ .\\ ] ] in this equation , the first and the second term correspond respectively to majority- and minority - spin electrons .",
    "the antiferromagnetic conguration is obtained by reversing the magnetization of @xmath4 , i.e. , by interchanging @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; thus the corresponding energy per unit area is @xmath64 \\ , { { \\rm d}}\\varepsilon \\ .\\ ] ] thus , the interlayer exchange coupling energy is @xmath65 \\ , { { \\rm d}}\\varepsilon\\ ] ] which can be simplified as @xmath66 in the limit of weak confinement .",
    "the above expression for the iec has a rather transparent physical interpretation .",
    "first , as the integrations on * k*@xmath67 over the first two - dimensional brillouin zone and on the energy up to the fermi level show , the iec is a sum of contributions from all occupied electronic states .",
    "the contribution of a given electronic state , of energy @xmath68 and in - plane wavevector * k*@xmath67 , consists of the product of three factors : the two factors @xmath69 and @xmath70 express the spin - asymmetry of the confinement due to the magnetic layers @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , while the exponential factor @xmath71 describes the propagation through the spacer and is responsible for the interference ( or quantum size ) effect .",
    "thus , this approach establishes an explicit and direct link between oscillatory iec and quantum size effects such as observed in photoemission .      in the limit of large spacer thickness @xmath2 ,",
    "the exponential factor oscillates rapidly with @xmath68 and * k*@xmath67 , which leads to some cancellation of the contributions to the iec due to the different electronic states .",
    "however , because the integration over energy is abruptly stopped at @xmath72 , states located at the fermi level give predominant contributions .",
    "thus the integral on @xmath68 may be calculated by fixing all other factors to their value at @xmath72 , and by developing @xmath73 around @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath74 with @xmath75 the integration ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) yields @xmath76 where @xmath77 in the above equations , @xmath78 is a vector spanning the _ complex fermi surface _ ; the velocity @xmath79 is a combination of the group velocities at the extremities @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "next , the integration on @xmath82 is performed by noting , that , for large spacer thickness @xmath2 , the only significant contributions arise from the neighboring of critical vectors @xmath83 where @xmath78 is stationary . around such vectors ,",
    "@xmath78 may be expanded as @xmath84 where the cross terms have been canceled by a proper choice of the axes ; @xmath85 and @xmath86 are combinations of the curvature radii of the fermi surface at @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the integral is calculated by using the stationary phase approximation,@xcite and one obtains @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 correspond to the critical vector @xmath94 , and @xmath95 in the above equation , one takes the square root with an argument between @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this analysis shows that _ in fine _ , the only remaining terms in the limit of large spacer thickness @xmath2 arise from the neighborhood of states having in - plane wavevectors * k*@xmath98 such that the spanning vector of the fermi surface @xmath99 is stationary with respect to * k*@xmath67 for * k*@xmath100*k*@xmath98 , and the corresponding contribution oscillates with a wavevector equal to @xmath101 . this selection rule was first derived in the context of the rkky model @xcite ; it is illustrated in fig .",

    "almost all modern methods of electronic structure calculation rely the density functional theory ( dft ) of hohenberg and kohn @xcite , within the local density approximation ( lda ) of kohn and sham @xcite . in the dft ( generalized to take the spin polarization into account @xcite ) the system under consideration is described in terms of the local density spinor @xmath103 whose matrix elements are given by",

    "as it stands , this theory is not very convenient for computing exchange interactions : indeed , as it gives some information only on the ground state of a system , one would learn only which configuration of magnetic moments ( e.g. , ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic , or canted ) corresponds to the ground state ; thus would obtain the _ sign _ of the interaction , but one would not learn anything about its _",

    "* second , within the self - consistent approach the exchange energy , which is typically of the order of @xmath152 to @xmath153 ev@xmath154atom , is obtained as the difference between the total energies for two different configurations , which are of the order of @xmath155 ev / atom ; thus , the total energies must be obtained with a tremenduous relative accuracy in order to get reliable results . in this case",
    ", the results may be plagued by roundoff errors . *",
    "but the most serious difficulty we face when using the self - consistent approach is that it provides us very little physical insight about the mechanism of exchange interaction .",
    "for all the reasons mentioned above , it is desirable to develop a method which is computationally convenient and accurate , and at the same provides a clear physical picture of the mechanism of exchange interaction .",
    "the fact the energy of exchange interactions is small as compared to the total energy of the system suggests us that a perturbation - like theory might be appropriate .",
