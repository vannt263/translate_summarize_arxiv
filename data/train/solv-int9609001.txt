    "the finite non - periodic toda lattice equation @xcite describes a hamiltonian system of @xmath7 particles on a line interacting pairwise with exponential forces .",

    "as an immediate consequence of the lax form ( [ toda ] ) , the eigenvalues of @xmath19 are time - invariant . moreover , as @xmath20 , @xmath19 converges to a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues of @xmath13 in the decreasing order @xcite , which is referred as `` the sorting peoperty '' .",
    "tomei @xcite used the toda flow ( [ toda ] ) to study the iso - spectral manifolds of symmetric tridiagonal matrices , i.e. , in the form of ( [ l0 ] ) .",
    "he showed several interesting properties of the manifolds : the manifolds are orientable , with euclidean @xmath21 as the universal covering , and the symmetry group is @xmath22 , i.e. , the the direct product of @xmath5 and the permutaion group @xmath6 .",

    "an explicit solution formula is given by extending the `` orthonormalization '' method introduced in @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the case of tridiagonal @xmath28 , in analogue to the toda equation ( [ toda ] ) , the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 in this paper , we consider the integral manifolds of the hamiltonian systems given by ( [ ham1 ] ) . with different signs of @xmath31 s , there are a total of @xmath0 different type of toda lattices",

    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite that generically there are two types of solutions , having either the sorting property or blowing up to infinity in finite time .",
    "the structure of @xmath33-functions describing the solutions was also studied , and they are not positive definite as for the original toda equation",

    "model @xcite , which is one of the most important models in quantum field theory and string theory .",
    "it was then shown @xcite that the reduced system contains all the indefinite toda lattices . even though each of these toda lattices is singular in the sense of blow - up in the solution ,",
    "these are expected to be regularized by gluing them together through `` infinities '' in the full reduced system .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to give a concrete description of such regularization .",
    "namely we study a compactification of the integral manifolds of these indefinite toda lattices .",
    "our method is based on the explicit solution given in @xcite , which is different from the approach based on the bruhat decomposition .",
    "the bruhat decomposition of the special linear group @xmath34 is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the unipotent subgroup of lower triangular matrices with 1 s on the diagonal , @xmath37 is the borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices , and @xmath38 is the weyl group of @xmath34 .",
    "the cell of maximal dimension is @xmath39 ( i.e. @xmath40 ) which corresponds to the lu factorization .",
    "it is shown that the blow - up of the indefinite toda flow with @xmath41 at @xmath42 corresponds to the intersection , @xmath43 the codimension of @xmath44 ( which is given by the length of @xmath45 ) then gives the degeneracy of the blow - up .",
    "the complex version of the decomposition has been studied by flaschka and haine @xcite where they use `` painlve analysis '' to study the singularities and to compactify the flag manifold @xmath46 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give a summary of the results obtained in @xcite and reference therein for a basic background of the present paper . in section 3",
    ", we provide a detail study of the solution behaviors .",
    "in particular , we give the total number of blow - ups for generic orbits , which extends the well known result of the total positivity of @xmath33-functions studied in @xcite . in section 4 , we give an explicit construction of gluing indefinite toda lattices by adding infinities , i.e. , compactification of the iso - spectral manifold .",
    "we start with the cases of @xmath47 and @xmath48 as examples , then proceed to the general case . in section 5 ,",
    "we give a brief account of cw decomposition of the compacified iso - spectral manifold and show its nonorientability .",

    "it should be noted that with the normalization ( [ phis ] ) , the eigenmatrix @xmath59 becomes complex in general , even in the case that all the eigenvalues are real .",

    "the metric in the inner product is given by @xmath82 which leads to an indefinite metric due to a choice of negative entries @xmath83 in @xmath26 .",

    "we associate @xmath118 with an @xmath26 matrix through @xmath176 as in ( [ lh ] ) . with different signs of @xmath127",

    "let @xmath118 be a @xmath178 hessenberg matrix given by @xmath179 where @xmath57 is given by ( [ l ] ) and @xmath180 ( see remark 2 ) .",
    "we assume that the eigenvalues of @xmath118 are all real and @xmath181 .",
    "the characteristic polynomial for @xmath118 leads to @xmath182 eliminating @xmath183 in ( [ ab ] ) , we have @xmath184 the plot of ( [ b1 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "1 . there are two critical points ( @xmath185 or @xmath186 ) corresponding to @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "let us now give a detail analysis of the orbits of indefinite toda lattices associated with @xmath118 in ( [ lh22 ] ) :    \\(i ) the case @xmath189 : then the initial data @xmath190 is symmetric and diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix @xmath191 , i.e. @xmath192 , @xmath193 where @xmath194 is determined by the initial data .",
    "note that the solution of the toda equation depends on one parameter @xmath194 with fixed @xmath195 and @xmath196 . from ( [ ddd ] ) and ( [ evcs ] )",
    ", we have @xmath197 and @xmath198 we see from ( [ d11 ] ) that @xmath199 is positive definite , that is , the solution is regular ( no blow up ) and asymptotically @xmath200 thus @xmath201 tends to @xmath202 as @xmath20 and @xmath203 as @xmath174 .",
    "the orbit corresponds to a closed component with both critical points given as the curve in @xmath204 .",
    "\\(ii ) the case @xmath205 : the eigenmatrix @xmath59 for @xmath25 is now in @xmath206 .",
    "there are two disconnected components in @xmath207 , and each one connects to either @xmath208 or @xmath209 .",
    "we first consider the component connected to the vertex @xmath208 .",
    "taking the initial data with @xmath210 .",
    "the initial eigenmatrix @xmath211 is given by @xmath212 where @xmath213 determined by the initial data . from ( [ ddd ] ) and ( [ evcs ] ) , we obtain @xmath214 and @xmath215 from ( [ d12 ] ) , @xmath199 has a unique zero at @xmath216 for @xmath217 , the eigenmatrix @xmath85 is real and @xmath218 as @xmath219 , while for @xmath220 @xmath85 becomes pure imaginary and @xmath221 which implies @xmath222 .",
    "thus the solutions for @xmath217 and @xmath220 expresses components connecting to the vertices @xmath208 and @xmath203 respectively .",
    "we then connect these orbits at infinity , that is , we _ compactify _",
    "the integral manifold of the flow as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the resulting manifold is isomorphic to circle @xmath223 .",
    "this connection of orbits can be viewed as a gluing of two different indefinite toda systems . to see this",
    "more precisely , we first note that the solution @xmath224 are determined by the @xmath33-function @xmath169 , @xmath225 ^ 2 e^{\\lambda_1 t } + s_2[\\phi^0_1(\\lambda_2)]^2 e^{\\lambda_2 t } .\\ ] ] then the change of @xmath85 from real to imaginary implies the change of signs in @xmath226 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath227 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "this is then equivalent to the change of signs in @xmath228 and @xmath229 , or the exchange @xmath230 , with fixed signs of @xmath155 s .",
    "as we will see below , this can be naturally generalized for the @xmath14 case , that is , in each blow - up corresponding to @xmath231 we glue two systems with the @xmath26-matrices @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "now let us consider the case @xmath177 which contains main ideas for the general case . for @xmath177 , there are six critical points with @xmath234 which give the vertices ( @xmath235 ) of the integral manifold .",
    "around each vertex , there are four components assigned by the signs of @xmath236 and @xmath237 , i.e. @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 .",
    "the component + + is shown to be a hexagon .",
    "the edges ( @xmath242 ) of the hexagon correspond to the toda flows in the form of either @xmath186 or @xmath243 .",
    "each vertex has four edges , two of which are non - compact corresponding to blow - up solutions .",
    "the picture of the underlying manifold is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    we then compactify the manifold as follows : we first glue the edges as in the case @xmath47 .",
    "then for the flows around an outgoing edge , we take a small segment transversal to the flows at some point on the the edge , and determine how the flows transport this segment after the blow - up . in fig.2 ,",
    "the gluing pattern around one edge , @xmath186 , is indicated by arrows . repeating this process for every outgoing edges , we obtain the compactified manifold .",
    "it is immediate from the gluing pattern that the manifold is not orientable .",
    "its euler characteristic is calculated as @xmath244 ( see below for a detail ) .",
    "since every compact surfaces are completely classified by orietability and the euler characteristic , the manifold is topologically isomorphic to a connected sum of two klein bottles .",
    "we can also describe the gluing patterns from the viewpoint of symmetry groups acting on polytopes @xcite which provides a useful information for the study of the general case .",
    "we first mark the four components with @xmath245 and @xmath241 around the top vertex @xmath246:= \\left ( \\begin{array}{ccc } \\lambda_3 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_1 \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right ) $ ] as @xmath247 and @xmath248 , respectively . then following the flows starting from these components , we mark components around other vertices . for example , the flows starting from @xmath55 blow up and continue to either the component @xmath241 of the vertex @xmath249:=\\left ( \\begin{array}{ccc } \\lambda_3 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_2 \\\\ \\end{array } \\right ) $ ] or @xmath241 of @xmath250:=\\left ( \\begin{array}{ccc } \\lambda_2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3",
    "\\\\ \\end{array } \\right ) $ ] , then they blow up again and end in the component @xmath240 of the bottom vertex @xmath251:=\\left ( \\begin{array}{ccc } \\lambda_1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3",
    "\\\\ \\end{array } \\right ) $ ] .",
    "we then mark all of these components on the pass as @xmath55 .",
    "this gives the way of gluing the components around each vertex , and the glued components also form a hexagon .",
    "we then have a total of four hexagons . the gluing pattern and the marking for all components",
    "are shown in fig.3 .",
    "for example , a dotted line segment between a circle and a square is glued with the other segment which has the same vertices and connects with the same edge @xmath252 .",
    "so there are 3 vertices , marked by circle , square and triangle , and 6 edges in the compactified manifold .",
    "as we observed in the case of @xmath47 , the gluing pattern can be regarded as the permutation of vertices resulting from the permutation of the @xmath26 matrices ( i.e. different indefinite toda lattices ) . to see this , we associate each component with an @xmath26 matrix through @xmath176 .",
    "for instance , @xmath253 corresponds to @xmath241 .",
    "then the gluing pattern gives for example that the marking of the component associated with @xmath254 of the vertex @xmath246 $ ] is the same as the one with @xmath255 of @xmath256 $ ] .",
    "in general , let @xmath257 and @xmath258 be two vertices such that @xmath259 , then @xmath254 of @xmath257 is marked the same as @xmath260 of @xmath258 . in this sense , the symmetry group of the compactified manifold is the _",
    "semi_-direct product of @xmath261 and @xmath262 @xcite .",
    "this manifold is to be compared with the @xmath177 tomei s manifold , i.e. , the iso - spectral manifolds of tridiagonal symmetric matrices @xmath13 in ( [ l0 ] ) .",
    "there are also four components giving hexagons depending on the signs of @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "the toda flow with @xmath13 is complete ( no blow - up ) , and each component is invariant under the flow .",
    "so no gluing is neccessary , and the marking of the components is just given by the signs of @xmath263 and @xmath264 i.e. no permutation on the signs .",
    "thus the symmetry group for the case of tomei is the _ direct _ product of @xmath261 and @xmath262 .    with the above marking of the components , the flows in @xmath265 or @xmath248 generically blow up _ twice _ in @xmath148 .",
    "this can be verified by finding the zeroes of the @xmath33-functions @xmath106 and @xmath266 : writing @xmath267 , @xmath268 is given by @xmath269 without loss of generality we take @xmath270 .",
    "then there are four cases depending on the signs of @xmath271 and @xmath272 :    \\(1 ) @xmath273 , @xmath274 .",
    "in this case , @xmath169 and @xmath268 are positive definite .",
    "this corresponds to the flows in the component @xmath275 .",
    "\\(2 ) @xmath273 , @xmath276 .",
    "since @xmath277 for large postive @xmath142 and @xmath278 for large negative @xmath142 , there is at least one zero for @xmath106 . on the other hand , we find @xmath279 , so there is only one simple zero for @xmath169 .",
    "similarly , one shows that there is only one simple zero for @xmath266 . since @xmath280",
    ", these zeroes do not coincide .",
    "\\(3 ) @xmath281 , @xmath276 .",
    "we show similarly as for ( 2 ) that both @xmath106 and @xmath266 have a nondegenerate zero .",
    "\\(4 ) @xmath281 , @xmath274 .",
    "this case has the most interesting feature as we will see . from the asymptotic behaviors , it is easy to see both @xmath106 and @xmath266 are convex in @xmath142 and have either no or two zeroes . to be more precise ,",
    "we consider @xmath282 , and find the root , @xmath283\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then @xmath284 becomes @xmath285 also considering @xmath286 , we find that the solution is exactly that given by ( [ t0 ] ) , and @xmath287 becomes @xmath288 from ( [ tau1t0 ] ) and ( [ tau2t0 ] ) , if @xmath289 , then @xmath290 .",
    "this implies that ( i ) if @xmath106 ( or @xmath266 ) has two simple zeroes then @xmath266 ( or @xmath106 ) has no zero , or ( ii ) both @xmath106 and @xmath266 have a doubly degenerated zero at @xmath42 .",
