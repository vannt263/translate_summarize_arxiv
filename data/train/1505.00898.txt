    "mean - field approximations of stochastic processes are crucial in many areas of science , where a large system is described by a stochastic process and its expected behaviour is approximated by a simpler mean - field model using a system of differential equations .",
    "the stochastic processes of particular interest to us are binary network processes , where each node of a large network can be in one of two states and the state of a node changes depending on the states of the neighbouring nodes .",
    "the theory of their mathematical modelling can be found in several books and review papers @xcite .",
    "the two well - known examples we analyze in section 4 are epidemic and rumour spreading .    for concreteness",
    "we consider a continuous time markov process , @xmath2 , with states @xmath3 and let @xmath4 $ ] denote the discrete probability distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath5 is described by a linear system of differential equations , called the master equations .",
    "there is a well established theory for solving linear systems by expressing their solution as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the transition rate matrix of the system .",
    "it is also well - known that the matrix exponential is hard to compute for large matrices , hence methods have been developed exploiting any special structure of the matrix .",
    "recently , an extremely powerful method has been worked out for tridiagonal matrices by smith and shahrezaei @xcite .",
    "since one - step processes have tridiagonal transition matrices , the time dependence of the probabilities @xmath5 can be computed very efficiently .",
    "besides computational methods there are theoretical approaches to approximate , estimate and characterize qualitatively the time dependence of the probability distribution @xmath8 and its moments ( mainly its expected value ) .",
    "the typical approach is to introduce a low dimensional system of non - linear odes called the mean - field equations .",
    "these are not only faster to solve computationally but also allow for analysis giving a better qualitative understanding of the system .",
    "the accuracy of mean - field approximations is not obvious .",
    "the problem of rigorously linking exact stochastic models to mean - field approximations goes back to the early work of kurtz @xcite ( see @xcite for a more recent reference ) .",
    "he studied density - dependent markov processes and proved their stochastic convergence to the deterministic mean - field model .",
    "it can be shown that the difference between the solution of the mean - field equation and the expected value of the process is of order @xmath9 as @xmath1 tends to infinity @xcite .    however , it is natural to look for actual lower and upper bounds that can be used for finite @xmath1 ( in contrast to the previous asymptotic results ) .",
    "it is known that in many cases , the mean - field model yields an upper bound on the expected value of the process .",
    "the first lower bound is by armbruster and beck @xcite where a system of two odes proves a lower bound on the expected value in the case of a susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) epidemic model on a complete graph .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend these results to a wider class of markov chains , including several which approximate network processes .",
    "we develop bounds for _ one - step processes _ , also known as _ birth - death processes _ , that form an important class of continuous time markov processes , for which the state space is @xmath10 and it is assumed that transition from state @xmath11 is possible only to states @xmath12 at rate @xmath13 and to state @xmath14 at rate @xmath15 .",
    "the master equations are @xmath16 where of course @xmath17 .",
    "the bounds we develop are the solutions of simple odes and will hold for all @xmath1 .",
    "we will illustrate with numerical examples that the upper and lower bounds are remarkably close to each other .",
    "in section 2 we set up the problem , give the mean - field equation and the approximating system , state the main result , and state the tools used in the proof .",
    "section 3 proves the main result . in section 4",
    "we illustrate the performance of the bounds on two examples : an sis epidemic with and without airborne infection , and a voter - like model .",
    "section 5 concludes and discusses directions for future research .",
    "we first establish the differential equations for the moments of the process @xmath2 .",
    "we focus on the fraction @xmath18 since we are interested in situations with large @xmath1 and density dependent coefficients . by definition ,",

    "the following equations for @xmath23 can be derived using lemma 2 in @xcite , using the kolmogorov backward equations , or taking the time derivative of and substituting .",
    "@xmath24 we are interested in the case when @xmath25 and @xmath26 are polynomials of @xmath27 . then , @xmath28 can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of these polynomials .",
    "in fact , the following result was proved in @xcite .",

    "our mean - field equation @xmath38 is motivated by the approximations @xmath39 and @xmath40 for large @xmath1 , where the second approximation essentially assumes @xmath18 is deterministic .",

    "we allow for multiple routes of infection so that the infection spreads not only via the contact network , but also due to external forcing , such as airborne infection .",
    "the state space of the corresponding one - step process is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the state with @xmath11 infected nodes .",
    "in fact , the position of the infected nodes also affects the spreading process , hence the state space is larger , and therefore our model is only an approximation of the real infection propagation process . the validity of this approximation is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we note that in the case of a complete graph , the model is exact . starting from state @xmath11",
    "the system can move either to state @xmath14 or to @xmath12 , since at a given instant only one node can change its state .",

    "the solutions without airborne infection , @xmath171 , are shown in figure [ fig : sis ] for @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "it is important to note that for such large values of @xmath1 the master equation can not be solved numerically , but we know that the expected value @xmath174 is between the two curves given in the figure .",
    "we can also see that for small times the two bounds are nearly identical , i.e. , we get the expected value with high accuracy .",

    "here we get much closer bounds even for a small value of @xmath1 .",
    "consider again a regular random network where each node can be in one of two states , 0 or 1 , representing two opinions propagating along the edges of the network ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if a node is in state 0 and has @xmath178 neighbours in state 1 , then its state will change to 1 with probability @xmath179 in a small time interval @xmath180 .",

    "the opposite case can also happen , that is a node in state 1 can become a node with opinion 0 with a probability @xmath181 in a small time interval @xmath180 , if it has @xmath178 neighbours in state 0 .",

    "since there are @xmath150 nodes with opinion 0 and each of them has @xmath147 neighbours with the opposite opinion the total number of edges connecting nodes with two different opinions is @xmath152 .",
    "hence the rate of transition from state @xmath11 to state @xmath14 is @xmath183 similar reasoning leads to the rate of transition from state @xmath11 to @xmath12 as @xmath184 using these coefficients , @xmath15 and @xmath13 , the spreading process can be described by equation .",

    "also in the voter - like model , a violation of the sign condition ( i.e. , when @xmath50 , the rate of switching to opinion 0 , is greater than @xmath49 , the rate of switching to opinion 1 ) can be dealt with by switching the labels of the opinions or equivalently replacing @xmath72 by @xmath217 .",

    "<S> one - step processes , also known as birth - death processes , are an important class of such processes and are processes with state space @xmath0 and where each transition is of size one . </S>",
    "<S> we derive explicit bounds on the expected value of such a process , bracketing it between the mean - field model and another simple ode . </S>",
    "<S> while the mean - field model is a well known approximation , this lower bound is new , and unlike an asymptotic result , these bounds can be used for finite @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our bounds require that the markov transition rates are density dependent polynomials that satisfy a sign condition . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the tightness of our bounds on the sis epidemic process and the voter model . </S>"
