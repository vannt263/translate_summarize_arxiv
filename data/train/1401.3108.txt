    "non - hermitian operator has been introduced phenomenologically as an effective hamiltonian to fit experimental data in various fields of physics @xcite . in spite of",
    "the important role played non - hermitian operator in different branches of physics , it has not been paid due attention by the physics community until the discovery of non - hermitian hamiltonians with parity - time symmetry , which have a real spectrum @xcite .",
    "it has boosted the research on the complex extension of quantum mechanics on a fundamental level ann , jmp1,jpa1,jpa2,prl1,jmp2,jmp3,jmp4,jpa3,jpa4,jpa5 .",
    "non - hermitian hamiltonian can possess peculiar feature that has no hermitian counterpart .",
    "a typical one is the spectral singularity ( or exceptional point for finite system ) , which is a mathematic concept .",
    "it has gained a lot of attention recently @xcite , motivated by the possible physical relevance of this concept since the pioneer work ofmostafazadeh @xcite .",
    "the majority of previous works focus on the non - hermitian system arising from the complex potential , mean - field nonlinearity pra2,jpa6,ali3,pra13,prd2,prd3,prd4,prd5,prd6,prd7,prd8 as well as imaginary hopping integral @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the physical relevance of the spectral singularities for non - hermitian interacting many - particle system .",
    "the non - hermiticity arises from the imaginary interaction strength . for two - particle case",
    ", the exact solution shows that there exist a series of spectral singularities , forming a spectrum of singularity associated with the central momentum of the two particles .",
    "we consider dynamics of two bosons as well as fermions in one - dimensional system with imaginary delta interaction strength .",
    "it shows that the two - particle collision leads to amplitude - reduction of the wave function . for fermion pair ,",
    "the amplitude - reduction depends on the spin configuration of two particles .",
    "remarkably , in both cases , the residual amplitude can vanish only when the relative group velocity of two single - particle gaussian wave packets with equal width reaches the magnitude of the interaction strength .",
    "this phenomenon of complete particle - pair annihilation is the direct result of the spectral singularity .",
    "we also discuss the complete annihilations of a singlet fermion pair and a maximally two - mode entangled boson pair based on the second quantization formalism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ hamiltonian and solutions ] , we present the model hamiltonian and exact solution . in section [ dynamical signature ] , we construct the local boson pair initial state as initial state which is allowed to calculate the time evolution . based on this , we reveal the connection between the phenomenon of complete pair annihilation and the spectral singularity . in section [ second quantization representation ] , we extend our study a singlet fermion pair and a maximally two - mode entangled boson pair based on the second quantization formalism . finally , we give a summary in section [ summary ] .",
    "we start with an one - dimensional two - distinguishable particle system with imaginary delta interaction .",
    "the solution can be used to construct the eigenstates of two - fermion and boson systems .",
    "the hamiltonian has the form    @xmath0    where @xmath1  and we use dimensionless units @xmath2 for simplicity .    introducing new variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where    @xmath5    we obtain the following hamiltonian    @xmath6    with@xmath7here @xmath3  is the center - of - mass coordinate and @xmath4  is the relative coordinate .",
    "the hamiltonian is separated into a center - of - mass part and a relative part , and can be solvable exactly .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the center - of - mass motion @xmath8 are simply plane waves , while the hamiltonian @xmath9 is equivalent to that of a single - particle in an imaginary delta - potential , which has been exactly solved in the ref.@xcite . then the eigen functions of the original hamiltonian can be obtained and expressed as    @xmath10 \\right . & & \\label{wf_even } \\\\ \\left . -\\frac{i\\gamma } { k}\\sin \\left [ k\\left ( x_{1}-x_{2}\\right ) \\right ] \\text{\\textrm{sign}}\\left ( x_{1}-x_{2}\\right ) \\right\\ } , & &   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in symmetrical form , and@xmath11 ,   \\label{wf_odd}\\]]in antisymmetrical form .",
    "the corresponding energy is @xmath12with the central and relative momenta @xmath13 .",
    "the symmetrical wavefunction @xmath14 is the spatial part wavefunction for two bosons or two fermions in singlet pair , while the antisymmetrical wavefunction @xmath15 only for two triplet fermions .    before starting the investigation on dynamics of two - particle collision",
    ", we would like to point that there exist spectral singularities in the present hamiltonian .",
    "it arises from the same mechanism as that in the single - particle systems @xcite .",
    "we can see that the eigen functions with even parity and momentum @xmath16 can be expressed in the form@xmath17with energy @xmath18we note that function @xmath19  satisfies@xmath20 = 0,\\]]which accords with the definition of the spectral singularity in ref .",
    "it shows that there exist a series of spectral singularities associated with energy @xmath21 for @xmath22 , which constructs a spectrum of spectral singularities .",
    "we will demonstrate in the following section that such a singularity spectrum leads to a peculiar dynamical behavior of two local boson pair or equivalently , singlet fermion pair .",
    "the emergence of the spectral singularity induces a mathematical obstruction for the calculation of the time evolution of a given initial state , since it spoils the completeness of the eigen functions and prevents the eigenmode expansion .",
    "nevertheless , the completeness of the eigen functions is not necessary for the time evolution of a state with a set of given coefficients of expansion . it does not cause any difficulty in deriving the time evolution of an initial state with arbitrary combination of the eigen functions .",
    "namely , any linear combination of function set @xmath23  or @xmath24  can be an initial state , and the time evolution of it can be obtained simply by adding the factor @xmath25 .    in order to investigate the dynamical consequence of the singularity spectrum",
