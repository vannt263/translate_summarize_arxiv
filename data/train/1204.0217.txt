    "an important mechanism to explain the role of the ions on the electrical impedance response or immittance response of an insulated material ( solid , liquid or gel ) may be the selective adsorption of ions at the solid electrodes limiting the medium  @xcite .",
    "thus , to build a more complete model to evaluate the electrical impedance of this system it may also be necessary to take into account the dissociation of neutral particles in ionic products , the recombination of these ions giving rise to neutral particles  @xcite , and the adsorption  desorption process occurring at the interfaces  @xcite . in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "the importance of the dissociation - association process in the determination of the electrical impedance was analyzed in detail , but without taking into account the adsorption phenomena , in the framework of the poisson - nernst - planck ( pnp ) model .",
    "a conspicuous effect of this dissociation - association process is the appearance of a new plateau in the real part of the electrical impedance of the cell in the dc limit .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the importance of the dissociation - association phenomenon for the electrical impedance of an insulating medium containing ions  @xcite when the adsorption ",
    "desorption process is taken into account .",
    "specific adsorption effects at the electrodes have been already considered by adopting chang - jaff boundary conditions when the dissociation - association phenomenon was present  @xcite .",
    "the adsorption phenomenon considered here is governed by a kinetic equation describing a chemical reaction of first kind at the interface liquid medium  electrodes , by imposing the conservation of the mumber of particles in entire bulk plus electrodes system  @xcite . the mathematical problem to be solved",
    "is then represented by a set of fundamental equations that are different from the ones treated in ref .",
    "the strategy adopted here firstly analyze the situation for which the positive and negative ions have identical diffusion coefficients , i.e. , equal mobilities .",
    "this scenario may be useful for describing the diffusion of mobile charges in isotropic liquids in general .",
    "subsequently , the fundamental equations are faced by means of analytical methods , and the solutions are found for the case in which the diffusion coefficients of the positive and neutral particles are zero , a scenario eventually more appropriated to the description of e.g. , an insulating gel .",
    "the results we have obtained here are however quite general .",
    "in fact , they have been obtained in the framework of the pnp continuum model , in which the diffusion equation is solved together with the poisson s equation in order to establish the correct spatial profile of the electrical potential inside the sample .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the fundamental equations of the problem relevant to the drift  diffusion problem for the ions in an insulating medium ( solid , liquid , or gel ) , in the presence of the generation - recombination phenomenon , described as a first order chemical reaction , and incorporating a kinetic equation at the interface .",
    "the case in which the diffusion coefficients of the positive and negative ions are equal is considered in sec .",
    "the particular case in which the positive and neutral particles are stuck on the polymer chains forming the gel is discussed in sec .",
    "iii , where it is shown that the adsorption ",
    "desorption phenomenon is responsible for a low frequency plateau .",
    "in addition , the generation - recombination process may induce a plateau for intermediated frequencies depending on the thickness @xmath0 and on the debye s length @xmath1 considered .",
    "some concluding remarks are drawn in sec .",
    "the fundamental equations established in this section are relevant to a sample of an insulating medium limited by two identical plane - parallel electrodes , a distance @xmath2 apart .",
    "the medium , of dielectric constant @xmath3 , contains impurities that can decompose according to the chemical reaction @xmath4 , where @xmath5 indicates the neutral specie , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 the positive and negative ( monovalent ) ions created in the decomposition of @xmath5 .",
    "the dissociation constant is indicated by @xmath8 , and the association constant by @xmath9 .",
    "the geometry of the sample is such that the electrodes are located at the positions @xmath10 of an axis that is normal to the surfaces of these electrodes .",
    "in addition to the situation treated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the sample has the same geometry , we incorporate the adsorption ",
    "desorption process on the surface of the electrode .",
    "if we indicate by @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 the bulk densities of neutral , positive , and negative particles , respectively , in the presence of an electric field , of electrical potential @xmath14 , the respective bulk densities of current of the particles are    @xmath15 , \\quad { \\rm and}\\\\ \\label{eq2 - 3 } j_m&=&-{\\cal d}_m\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}n_{m}- \\frac{q}{k_{b}t}n_m\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}v_{}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which the corresponding diffusion coefficients are @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the equations of continuity , stating the conservation of the particles , are    @xmath19    the remaining equation of the model is the equation of poisson , relating the effective electric field to the net charge density . it is obtained by considering that the electrical displacement is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the bulk density of the charges in the medium .",
    "this quantity is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the ion electrical charge .",
    "in the one - dimensional case we are considering , the equation of poisson can be simply written as    @xmath24    the set of fundamental equations  ( [ eq1 ] )    ( [ eq0 ] ) have to be solved with the boundary conditions    @xmath25    and @xmath26 related to the assumption of the adsorption ",
    "desorption process and the presence of the external voltage @xmath27 , where @xmath28 refers to the positive ion and @xmath29 to the negative ion .",
    "as already mentioned , a similar problem was worked out in a different way , by considering the chang - jaff boundary conditions to take into account specific adsorption at the electrodes  @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning again that the equations to be solved here are different from the ones considered in ref .",
    "@xcite due to the kind of particles considered in both approaches . in the kinetic equation eq .",
    "( [ kinetic ] ) , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are parameters describing the adsorption phenomenon .",
    "this equation simply states that the time variation of the surface density of adsorbed particles @xmath32 ( i.e. , of both signs ) depends on the bulk density of particles just in front of the adsorbing surface , and on the surface density of particles already adsorbed .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 has obviously the dimension of time , whereas @xmath30 has the dimension of a length / time . consequently ,",
    "if the adsorption phenomenon is present , from the kinetic equation , it follows that there is an intrinsic thickness @xmath33 . as a final remark , we notice that by means of the eqs .",

    "desorption process is incorporated to the dynamics of the distribution of the ions in the cell .    following the developments performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we write @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the variations in the bulk density of ions due to the action of the external field are very small with respect to the values in thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "this linear approximation implies that the external difference of potential applied to the cell is such that @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "likewise , for the adsorbed quantities ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , we have @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "we also consider the applied potential given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the amplitude and @xmath53 the circular frequency of the applied voltage . in the limit of small applied voltage ( linear limit )",
    "the problem was solved in the absence of adsorption  desorption process  @xcite and the solution without generation and recombination of ions was found  @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we obtain analytical solutions for the problem in some particular situations , in order to get closed expressions for the impedance and admittance of the system .",
    "in general terms , it is possible to look for solutions of the problem in the form    @xmath54    using the approximation discussed above and the ansatz  ( [ ansatz ] ) , the fundamental equations of the problem can be rewritten as    @xmath55    equations  ( [ eqx1])-([eqx1 - 3 ] ) have to be solved with the boundary conditions , at @xmath10 ,    @xmath56    with @xmath57 .",
    "the solution of the problem in the absence of adsorption - desorption process has been presented in  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the particular cases where @xmath58 with @xmath59 , and @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "the first case is rather simple , and could be used to describe systems like a water solution of kcl , close to the saturation .",
    "the second case could be of some importance in describing the behavior of gels doped with salt because only negative ions contribute to the conduction mechanism , since the positive ones are stuck on the polymer chains  @xcite .",
