    "this leads to increasing values of the higher coefficients @xmath63 in the expansion ( [ c6 ] ) of the order parameter and as a result , to spreading of the deformation far from the defect.the further the growth of the magnetic field is , the larger are the effective coupling constants .",
    "this implies that the last term in the eq.([ovch ] ) for @xmath117 becomes much larger than all preceding terms . in this case",

    "this value completely compensates the contribution of the unperturbed abrikosov lattice to the @xmath117 expansion coefficient in eq.([c6 ] ) . in this region of fields the expansion ( [ c6 ] ) begins from @xmath119 .",
    "the order parameter in the nearest vicinity of the defect becomes @xmath128    this means that the six nearest vortices have ( almost ) collapsed on the defect which pins the vortex containing seven flux quanta .",

    "+ in the region where @xmath174 and @xmath175 a local symmetry transition @xmath176 due to vortex collapse is described by the last fourth ray on the diagram .",
    "this ray corresponds to the parameters @xmath160 , @xmath177 .",
    "during the two previous sections we dealt with a single defect problem . to be sure that our results ( [ f ] ) do describe a macroscopic system with a finite concentration of the defects we have to be sure that the next ( second order ) concentration correction to the thermodynamic potential is small . to estimate this correction one has to solve exactly the two defects problem which is much more complicated",
    ". therefore we choose another way .",
    "+ consider for simplicity an attractive case and magnetic field which is not too close to @xmath178 put the undistorted vortex lattice on the plane where ( point ) defects are distributed and shift one of the vortices nearest to each inhomogeneity to the position of that inhomogeneity .",
    "there are many similar ways to arrange the vortex lattice , but one has to choose such a way which leads to alternation of the regions where the lattice is compressed with ones where its rarefied .",
    "finally let us distort the regions of the lattice close to inhomogeneities according to the results obtained within single defect approximation .",
    "this latter distortion is already taken into account _",
    "exactly_. so one has only to estimate the additional contribution to the thermodynamic potential from the intermediate regions ( between inhomogeneities ) whose deformation is well described by elastic theory .",
    "+ the number of extra vortices per region is of order of unity .",
    "therefore the deformation tensorup to a numerical factor of the order of unity equals to dimensionless concentration of defects @xmath179 .",
    "the correction to the thermodynamic potential will be of the order of @xmath180 , where @xmath130 is the elastic modulus .",
    "but the elastic part of the deformation has an alternating behavior with a characteristic wavelength of the order of the average distance between inhomogeneities .",
    "as it was shown by e. brandt @xcite , all the elastic moduli are proportional to @xmath181 if this distance is much less than the penetration length divided by @xmath182 .",
    "the latter inequality can be rewritten as @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is the ginzburg - landau parameter . in the region of parameters which we are mostly interested in @xmath185 , @xmath186 and the inequality @xmath184 is evidently valid .",
    "this means that corresponding contribution to the thermodynamic potential is of the order of @xmath187 .",
    "this is exactly the second order concentration correction which in the case @xmath188 is smaller than the contribution accounted for within the linear concentration expansion .",
    "+ thus in the case of small concentration one can use the results obtained in the two previous sections and describe the thermodynamics of the system near @xmath6 . define a dimensionless magnetization @xmath189 and dimensionless magnetic succeptibility @xmath190    = 10.7 cm = 9.14 cm    all the local symmetry transitions described above",
    "manifest themselves as jumps on the magnetization curve ( fig.[p0_5 m ] ) and as discontinuities on the magnetic succeptibility curve ( fig.[p0_5s ] ) .",
    "the most pronounced jumps occur at the two transitions accompanied by vortex collapse , namely at the fields @xmath167 and @xmath191 .",
    "+    = 8.88 cm",
    "we studied the equilibrium properties of conventional type ii superconductor with small concentration of randomly placed identical columnar defects . in the vicinity of the upper critical field the vortex lattice undergoes a strong deformation with two possible local symmetries ",
    "hexagonal one @xmath1 and trigonal one @xmath0 .",
    "the character of the deformation is determined by the vortex - defect interaction .",
    "the vortices can collapse onto attractive defects and the formation of multy - quanta vortices becomes possible .",
    "formation of the multiquantum vortices was predicted earlier @xcite , but in `` twice '' opposite limiting case .",
    "we deal with a short - range defect and gain an energy because of softening of the abrikosov lattice near @xmath192 while in @xcite a very strong defect with a radius comparable with the penetration length was considered .",
    "+ increasing the external field gives rise to the reentering transitions between the two possible types of symmetry .",
    "these transitions can be described by a universal phase diagram .",
    "they manifest themselves as jumps of the magnetization and peculiarities of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "one of the way to observe these equilibrium states near @xmath6 is to cool a sample subject to a magnetic field in the normal state , below the critical temperature .",
    "another possibility is to observe not the equilibrium state as a whole , but visualize the local deformation of the vortex lattice near defects .",
