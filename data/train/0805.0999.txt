    "the minimal standard supersymmetric model ( mssm ) is the simplest supersymmetric extension beyond the standard model of particle physics , and stands to be tested in the upcoming large hadronic collider experiments at cern .",
    "the mssm not only addresses fundamental questions in particle physics , but also naturally provides a compelling dark matter candidate , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . in particular , the neutralino , which is a linear combination of the supersymmetric partners of the photon , the z boson , and the neutral scalar higgs particles , has the right cross section and mass to automatically provide the observed density of cold dark matter in the universe .",
    "according to the analysis in @xcite , the latter has the value @xmath3 here subscript @xmath4 refers to neutralinos , @xmath5 is the hubble constant @xmath6 in units of 100 km / s / mpc , and @xmath7 is the fraction of the neutralino density @xmath8 in units of the critical density @xmath9 @xmath10 g/@xmath11 ( alternatively , @xmath12 is the neutralino mass density in units of 18.79 yg / m@xmath13 ) .",
    "perelstein and spethmann @xcite examined a particularly interesting region of mssm parameter space which they dubbed the `` golden region . ''",
    "they argued that data and naturalness ( i.e.  a low degree of fine - tuning ) point to a region within the higgs and top sectors where the experimental bounds from non - observation of superpartners and the higgs boson are satisfied and fine - tuning is close to the minimum possible value .",
    "they found that , in this region , ( i ) the two stop eigenstates have masses below 1 tev , ( ii ) there is a significant mass splitting between the two stop mass eigenstates , typically @xmath14gev , and ( iii ) the stop mixing angle must be nonzero .",
    "they then suggested collider signatures of the golden region that may be found at the lhc .    in this paper , we further examine this golden region , with a particular focus on discovering the properties of the dark matter within it .",
    "we use the numerical package darksusy @xcite to find the same golden region as @xcite , and apply additional constraints due to experimental bounds on @xmath15 as well .",
    "then we look for the parameter regime inside the remaining golden region that also gives the right relic density of neutralino dark matter .",
    "below we begin by reviewing the boundaries of the golden region , and then turn to the properties of the dark matter within it .",
    "we work in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . for practical reasons , and to match the choices in @xcite , we impose the following restrictions on the mssm parameters : ( 1 ) we assume that all soft parameters are flavor - diagonal , ( 2 ) we assume a common soft mass for the first and second generation squarks , @xmath16 , and for all sleptons , @xmath17 , ( 3 ) we set all tridiagonal terms @xmath18 to zero except for @xmath19 , ( 4 ) we further assume that the third generation soft mass @xmath20 , but let @xmath21 and @xmath22 vary independently .",
    "we remain with 11 free parameters : the higgs mass parameter @xmath23 , the mass @xmath24 of the cp - odd higgs boson , the ratio @xmath25 of the higgs vacuum expectation values , the gaugino mass parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the soft parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the third - generation soft parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath19 . furthermore , following @xcite , we replace the last three parameters ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath19 ) with the mass of the lightest stop @xmath31 , the mass difference between the stop masses @xmath32 , and the stop mixing angle @xmath33 . finally , we use @xmath34 gev for the top - quark mass , and define all parameters at the weak scale .",
    "we scan the 11-dimensional parameter space by generating random values of the parameters . in most of our results ,",
    "we use the parameters within the following ranges ( all dimensionful parameters are in gev ) : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 notice that we fixed the value of @xmath33 and tan@xmath39 to reproduce one of the panels in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "we define our `` default scan '' to be the case where these values are fixed at @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we also produced other special scans : we randomized @xmath25 in the range 0.5 to 30 ; we implemented the gut relation between @xmath42 , and @xmath28 ; we separately extended @xmath26 up to 2000 gev .",
    "as a function of the mass of the lightest stop @xmath31 .",
    "we have scanned susy parameter space with constraints imposed from the bound on the higgs mass , fine tuning , and other experimental constraints including @xmath43 to find an `` improved '' golden region ; here we have fixed @xmath44 and @xmath45 as our `` default scan '' in parameter space . for comparison ,",
    "the area enclosed by the solid line shows the corresponding golden region previously found in fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "note that our lowest value of @xmath46gev is lower than that in the previous work as discussed in the text.,width=384 ]    the points in fig .",
    "[ improvedgoldenregion ] illustrate the golden region we obtain in our default scan .",
    "we have plotted the mass difference between the stop masses @xmath47 as a function of the mass of the lightest stop @xmath31 .",
    "this plot can be directly compared with fig .  2 of @xcite , from which the solid triangular region is drawn .",
    "using darksusy , we have improved upon the previous work by applying more accurate calculations of the higgs boson mass and of the @xmath48 branching ratio , as described below .",
    "a variety of other experimental constraints are applied as well , using their implementation in darksusy . in particular ,",
    "lep2 searches for direct production of charginos and stops constrain the chargino and stop masses , resulting in @xmath49  gev and @xmath50  gev . the @xmath15 decay rate",
    "@xcite also constrains the golden region . whereas @xcite noted that including this constraint was mostly beyond the scope of their paper , we have implemented this constraint throughout .",
    "hence our results in fig .  [ improvedgoldenregion ] illustrate the `` improved '' golden region in the presence of this additional constraint ( and of a more accurate calculation of the higgs boson masses ) .",
    "we note that @xcite defined a benchmark point in their table 1 , with particular choices of the other parameters , and _ did _ include @xmath51 ratio when they checked this point using suspect .",
    "suspect gave them an acceptable @xmath52 ratio for their benchmark model , but darksusy ( which includes better expressions for the branching ratio with nlo corrections ) gives an unacceptable value .",
    "the golden region in fig .",
    "[ improvedgoldenregion ] contains 7000 points satisfying all relevant bounds .",
    "the region is a triangle , with the lower boundary due to the constraint on the higgs mass , the leftmost boundary due to the bounds on the @xmath53 parameter , and the upper boundary due to fine - tuning .",
    "we now discuss each of these bounds in turn .",
    "the lower boundary of the golden region triangle is set by bounds on the higgs mass .",
    "the lep2 lower bound on the standard model higgs mass is @xcite @xmath54 for generic mssm parameter choices , the limit on the lightest higgs is very close to this value as well and we may use this bound . at tree level , the mssm predicts @xmath55 , so that large loop corrections are required to satisfy this bound .",
    "the dominant one - loop corrections are from top and stop loops .",
    "the numerical package feynhiggs @xcite is incorporated into darksusy to properly compute the higgs mass and to apply the experimental bound .",
    "we note that the resulting boundary to the golden region that we find is slightly different from that of @xcite : e.g. at @xmath56gev , our lowest value of @xmath46gev is quite a bit lower than their lowest value of @xmath57 .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that their analytic approximations for the higgs masses are less accurate than the values we find using the numerical package .",
    "fine - tuning of the z mass also constrains the higgs sector . at tree level ,",
    "the z mass in the mssm is given by m_z^2 = - m_u^2 ( 1- ) - m_d^2 ( 1 + ) -2||^2 , where 2 = . since one of the two cp - even higgs masses must satisfy @xmath58 for electroweak symmetry breaking , and since experimentally it is found that at least one of @xmath59 , cancellation of the terms on the right hand side is required in order to get the right value of @xmath60 . following barbieri and giudice  @xcite , one may quantify this fine - tuning by computing a()=| | where @xmath61 are the relevant lagrangian parameters . then a ( ) & = & ( 1 + ^2 2 ) , a(b ) & = & ( 1+)^2 2 , a(m_u^2 ) & = & | 2+^2-|(1-+ ^2 2 ) , a(m_d^2 ) & = &    the overall fine - tuning @xmath62 is defined by adding the four @xmath18 s in quadrature ;",
    "values of @xmath62 far above one indicate fine - tuning .",
    "following @xcite , we require @xmath63 , corresponding to fine tuning of 1% or better ; this bound is implemented in our work and produces an upper bound @xmath64 gev for @xmath65 .",
    "this matches the upper bound on @xmath23 found in @xcite .",
    "we impose the constraints on the chargino mass from lep2 chargino searches , which select @xmath66 gev .",
    "the upper boundary of the golden region triangle is determined by further restrictions on the fine - tuning .",
    "quantum corrections to naturalness also constrain the size of the quantum corrections to the parameters in eq .  .",
    "following @xcite , here we consider the largest correction in the mssm , namely the one - loop contribution to the @xmath67 parameter from top and stop loops : @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the top mass , @xmath70 is the scale at which the logarithmic divergence is cut off , and finite ( matching ) corrections have been ignored .",
    "the correction to the z mass induced by this effect is _",
    "t m_z^2 -m_h_u^2 ( 1- ) .to measure the fine - tuning between the bare ( tree - level ) and one - loop contributions , @xcite introduced _",
    "t = || . choosing the maximum allowed value of @xmath71 selects a region in the stop sector parameter space , @xmath72 ,",
    "whose shape is approximately independent of the other parameters .",
    "this constraint is outlined by the upper edge in fig .",
    "[ improvedgoldenregion ] , which corresponds to @xmath73 ( 3% fine tuning ) .",
    "note that the particular value of @xmath71 depends on the scale @xmath70 ; we choose @xmath74 tev in this figure .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the shape of the @xmath71 contours and the obvious trend for fine tuning to increase with the two stop masses is independent of @xmath70 .",
    "the left boundary of the golden region triangle is set by measurements of the @xmath53 parameter , which obtains corrections from stop and sbottom loops .",
    "we compute the @xmath53 parameter using darksusy and require @xmath75 which represents the 2@xmath76 range from @xcite .",
    "now that we have found the improved golden region with the @xmath48 bound implemented , we can investigate the properties of the dark matter in this region . using darksusy",
    ", we find the neutralino relic density for each set of mssm parameter values in the improved golden region .",
    "[ mxomega7 ] shows the relic density as a function of neutralino mass for all our default points in the golden region .",
    "as discussed previously , our default scan is defined by fixing @xmath40 and @xmath77 and scanning over other parameters .",
    "the lines illustrate the band that satisfies the cosmological requirement of @xmath12 in eq.([eq : relic ] ) .",
    "notice that there are points with the correct density for practically all neutralino masses in the golden region ( with perhaps a tiny exception at the largest masses ) .",
    "although most of the points in the figure have small @xmath12 , we remind the reader that the density of points , in this and all the other plots is arbitrary .",
    "the simulation uses a random number generator in the parameter domain .",
    "the dots are used for a plot as long as they satisfy the criteria for the golden region .",
    "thus , the dot density does nt necessarily have a physical meaning .",
