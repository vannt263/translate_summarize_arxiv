    "the great difficulty in explaining the x - ray emission _ and _ allowing the magnetic field and relativistic electrons to be near equipartition , led to suggestions  @xcite that the extended jet structure was in bulk relativistic motion with @xmath0 10 on scales greater than 100 kpc . with chandra detection of x - ray jets soon to be in the tens of objects , models for at least 3c  273  @xcite , and 3c  371  @xcite also call for large scale relativistic motions .",

    "as the jets maintain their apparent surface brightness , they can even outshine the quasar cores .",
    "such a case might be speculated for pks 2215 + 020 , at z=3.572 , where rosat detects an unusually high x - ray to optical flux ratio  @xcite .",
