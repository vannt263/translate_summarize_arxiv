    "the possibility that some of the unknown components of the universe at different epochs ( inflaton field , dark matter or dark energy ) could be described by means of homogeneous vector fields rather than scalar fields have conflicted traditionally with the stringent limits on isotropy imposed by cmb observations @xcite .",
    "the only scenarios in which these limitations could be evaded are those in which either only the temporal components of the vector fields are present or , in the case in which spatial components are also evolving , if the vector configuration guarantees an isotropic energy - momentum tensor .",
    "two possible isotropic configurations discussed in the literature are the presence of a triad of mutually orthogonal vectors @xcite or the existence of a large @xmath0 number of randomly oriented vectors , so that the average isotropy violation is kept relatively small of order @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , recently @xcite a new possibility was devised in which a general isotropy theorem for vector fields was proved .",
    "provided vector field evolution is bounded and rapid compared to the rate of expansion , it was shown that the average energy - momentum tensor is always diagonal and isotropic for any kind of initial configuration .",
    "a typical example of rapid bounded evolution corresponds to massive vector fields with masses larger than the hubble parameter .",
    "the theorem was proved in the case of abelian fields with standard maxwell kinetic term . in this work",
    "we are interested in extending it to more general non - abelian gauge theories in which gauge - fixing terms could also be present .",
    "unlike abelian theories , the presence of multiple vector fields in yang - mills theories allows to implement in a natural way the triad configuration mentioned before .",
    "thus , in @xcite it was found that for su(2 ) groups , homogeneous and isotropic configurations compatible with frw backgrounds can be parametrized with a single function of time .",
    "different proposals for dark energy or inflationary models based on this triad solution with different types of actions have been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "however apart from this particular type of solution no further isotropic configuration has been proposed to date .",
    "the theorem presented in this work applies quite generally without resorting to particular solutions by means of a generalization of the classical virial theorem and allows to ensure homogeneity and isotropy in average irrespective of the concrete dynamics of the non - abelian fields for arbitrary semi - simple groups .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in section ii we introduce yang - mills theories in frw backgrounds and obtain the corresponding equations of motion and energy - momentum tensor components . in section iii",
    "we introduce the generalized version of the virial theorem and show that in average the energy - momentum tensor is diagonal and isotropic for semi - simple groups . as an example we compute the average equation of state for certain su(2 ) solutions . in section",
    "iv we extend these results to actions including gauge - fixing terms and obtain the average equation of state in different cases .",
    "we also consider the case with temporal components only .",
    "section v is devoted to the extension to more general background metrics and finally section vi contains the main conclusions of the work .",
    "starting from a theory whose action has a global symmetry , if we would like to make it invariant under local symmetry transformations , we must add new bosons and define a covariant derivative : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the symmetry group generators .",
    "we will assume a compact semi - simple lie group with a finite number of generators .",
    "in this case , it is always possible to find an orthonormal basis for the group generators for which : @xmath5 and the structure constants defined as :    @xmath6 = i c_{a b c } t^c\\;;\\ ] ]    are totally antisymmetric ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this property will be very helpful for our future discussion .    in order to write a kinetic term for gauge bosons , we consider the curvature tensor associated to the covariant derivative : @xmath7=\\partial_{\\mu } a_{\\nu}- \\partial_{\\nu } a_{\\mu}+ \\left [ a_{\\mu},a_{\\nu } \\right]\\;.\\ ] ] notice that this expression is still valid in curved space - time due to the antisymmetry properties of the @xmath8 tensor .",
    "the corresponding components read : @xmath9    finally , the yang - mills lagrangian density reads : @xmath10    in this work we will study yang - mills theories with a potential of the form @xmath11 , with @xmath12 a constant symmetric matrix , so that gauge symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "thus , the action in general curved space - times will read : @xmath13 the corresponding equations of motion are given by : @xmath14 where .",
    "we will be interested in cosmological solutions for which the gauge fields will depend only on time @xmath15 and the metric tensor will be given by the that of a flat flrw metric : @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the conformal time coordinate .",
    "the field equations expressed in components can be written as @xmath18 for @xmath19 , and @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "notice that there is no second time derivative of the temporal component in these equations , as expected for the standard kinetic term we are using . on the other hand , the energy - momentum tensor is given by : @xmath22 expressed in components , @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25\\ ; , \\;\\;\\ ; i\\neq j \\label{tijgau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath26 the average of the pressure along the three spatial directions will be denoted by : @xmath27 it is possible to show that , using the equations of motion of the temporal components ( [ mu0 ] ) , the energy fluxes vanish , indeed : @xmath28",
    "we will follow the method presented in @xcite , in order to compute the average components of the energy - momentum tensor . with that purpose",
    ", we will generalize the virial theorem in order to apply it to non - abelian fields , thus we define : @xmath29 now is alike the `` i '' position coordinate of the classical point particle `` a '' .",
    "thus , in the case @xmath30 , the problem is analogue to a mechanical system of @xmath0 interacting particles in three dimensions , with @xmath0 the group dimension .",
    "notice however that the isotropy theorem we will show below is valid also for @xmath31 .",
    "+   + assuming a rapid evolution of the vector field , we can neglect the expansion of the universe at the field equations , the time derivative of the previous expression becomes : @xmath32 integrating the last expression on @xmath33 $ ] where @xmath34 is larger than the typical time scale of the vector field evolution @xmath35 but smaller than the typical time scale of the universe expansion @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 , we obtain : @xmath38 if the motion is periodic or it is bounded , the left hand side of the equation vanishes and therefore : @xmath39 using these equations , we will show in the following that the average energy - momentum tensor is diagonal and isotropic .    from the off - diagonal part of the tensor ( [ tijgau ] ) , noting that : @xmath40 where the parenthesis in the sub - index means symmetrization , we can write : @xmath41 using the average expression ( [ vircero ] ) , we directly obtain : @xmath42 we can prove the isotropy of the diagonal elements in a similar way .",
    "indeed , the diagonal spatial components of the energy - momentum tensor are @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the anisotropic part of these components , @xmath45 , \\;\\;\\ ; k=1,2,3\\,;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is equal to the expression @xmath46 when @xmath47 . therefore @xmath48\\rightarrow",
    "\\langle t^k_k \\rangle = 0 , \\;\\;\\ ; k=1,2,3\\,;\\label{tk}\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where again we have made use of ( [ vircero ] ) .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the virial theorem guarantees the isotropy of the energy - momentum tensor and its diagonal form in average .      for su(2 )",
    "groups some particular solutions are already known in flat space - time , see @xcite where a triad solution was proposed : @xmath49 notice that in those solutions the temporal components of the vector fields vanish . for abelian field theories the vanishing of the temporal component comes naturally from the equation of motion , as it can be seen in ( [ mu0 ] ) by making @xmath50 . in the non - abelian case it would be possible to have solutions with non - vanishing time components , however in the present example we are not considering this possibility .",
    "notice also that this kind of solutions only depend on a single function of time .",
    "we have checked that for the above ansatz , solutions also exists in an expanding background .",
    "let us define : @xmath51 the average energy - momentum tensor components then take the form : @xmath52 notice that this particular example corresponds to the triad case discussed before for which the energy - momentum tensor is manifestly isotropic . for simplicity we will assume a power law potential : @xmath53 for the particular ansatz ( [ partsol ] )",
    ", we get : @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 we can write : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the average value over an oscillation and @xmath59 the periodic part of the oscillation , that can be neglected ( see @xcite ) . calling @xmath60 and taking the scale factor as a constant @xmath61",
    ", we can define an effective potential : @xmath62 such that : @xmath63 notice that the non - abelian contributions appear as a quartic term in the effective potential , so that in the strong coupling limit , we expect the equation of state to correspond to that of a scalar field with a quartic potential , i.e. that of radiation @xcite .    in order to compute the equation of state ,",
    "we first obtain @xmath58 following @xcite as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the turning points of the effective potential where @xmath67 .",
    "the corresponding equation of state is @xmath68 , being @xmath69 .",
    "the integrals can not be computed analytically but the numerical results is not proportional to @xmath70 , except when @xmath71 , and that is the reason why the virial theorem can not be used to obtain the equation of state analytically as done in @xcite ] show that @xmath72 depends on @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 varying between radiation for large @xmath75 ( the new non - abelian term dominates in ( [ veff ] ) ) and the corresponding @xmath77 of the abelian case @xcite for a given @xmath73 when @xmath75 is small ( see fig .",
    "[ figg ] ) .",
    "changes by varying @xmath75 in the su(2 ) non - abelian case with potential ( [ powlaw ] ) , for a given energy density and @xmath76 parameter .",
    "the different lines correspond to different values of the potential exponent @xmath73 in ( [ veff ] ) .",
    "we can observe that for large @xmath75 values , the non - abelian term dominates and the equation of state approaches the radiation behaviour independently of @xmath73 . on the contrary , for small @xmath75 ,",
    "the abelian case is recovered @xcite.,width=264 ]     changes by varying @xmath78 $ ] in the su(2 ) non - abelian case , for @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "it can be seen how the behaviour of the higher power dominates at high energy density while the contrary happens when the energy density is low.,width=264 ]     +   + the behaviour of the equation of state depends also on the energy density .",
    "if the energy density decreases as the universe expands so that the amplitude of the field oscillations decreases in time , then at late times the smallest power in the effective potential ( [ veff ] ) will dominate .",
    "thus , for power - law potentials we can have two possibilities : for @xmath82 , the potential term will contribute at high energies ( early times ) and @xmath83 , whereas at low energies ( late times ) , the non - abelian quartic term will dominate and @xmath84 . for @xmath85 , the situation is reversed and at high energies , we have domination of the non - abelian term and @xmath84 , whereas at low energies @xmath83 ( see fig . [ figrho ] and reference @xcite ) .",
    "as is well - known the standard kinetic term for gauge fields ( [ kinetic ] ) does not contain a time derivative of the temporal components which implies that no conjugate momenta can be defined for those fields .",
    "accordingly , temporal components can not be quantized along with the spatial ones , thus preventing an explicitly covariant quantization of the theory .",
    "covariant quantization thus requires the modification of the kinetic term by including new gauge - breaking terms @xcite .",
    "those terms can be included directly in the action as in the gupta - bleuler formalism or they could appear as a consequence of the selection of a representative within each gauge orbit in the path integral approach . restricting to the case of quadratic gauge - breaking terms",
    "the action reads : @xmath86 we can express the covariant equations of motion as @xmath87 by introducing the homogeneity condition , this expression is reduced to : @xmath88 in order to have oscillations we must restrict the parameter space and initial conditions . in the case of a power law potential like",
    "( [ powlaw ] ) with an odd power , those conditions simply require @xmath89 .",
    "notice that we do not need to impose any condition over the temporal component in order to ensure isotropy .",
    "+ the energy - momentum tensor has the form : @xmath90- 4 a^a_{(\\mu } \\nabla _ { \\nu ) } ( \\nabla_{\\rho } a^{a \\ ; \\rho } ) \\right]\\;,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parenthesis in the sub - index means symmetrization .",
    "if @xmath91 , the energy density associated to the temporal component of the field is generally negative defined .",
    "this is consistent with the standard interpretation of @xmath92 as a ghost field .",
    "the presence of ghosts is a potential problem in vector field theories and has to be carefully studied case by case @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will show that the introduction of the gauge breaking term does not spoil the averaged isotropy of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "let us first consider the energy fluxes .",
    "we see that : @xmath93= 0\\;,\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last step we have used the equations of motion of the temporal components ( [ eomgaut ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the new @xmath94 term does not contribute either to @xmath46 or @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , following the same procedure of the previous section ( see eqs . ( [ g ] ) to ( [ tk ] ) ) , we can conclude that the virial theorem also guarantees in this case the isotropy of the energy - momentum tensor and its diagonal form in average if the spatial fields oscillate fast enough compared with the expansion rate of the universe .      in order to obtain the equation of state we will proceed in a different way as it has been done in the previous section .",
    "we take the trace of the energy - momentum tensor : @xmath95\\;. \\label{trace}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath96 the average pressure along the three spatial directions defined in ( [ p ] ) .",
    "thus , we have : @xmath97 notice that the fast oscillations condition is not mandatory for the temporal part since it does not contribute to the anisotropies . nevertheless ,",
    "if the oscillations are indeed faster than the expansion rate of the universe , taking the average , we get : @xmath98 notice that the @xmath94 term , when neglecting the scale factor derivatives , is nothing but the temporal derivative of the @xmath99 function used in the virial theorem which in average vanishes , i.e. : @xmath100 and as in the spatial case ( [ vircero ] ) , we get : @xmath101    thus , we can give an expression for @xmath77 depending only on the average of the potential and the energy density : @xmath102 considering a power law potential , the expression reduces to : @xmath103 as it can be seen the solution for a potential with @xmath71 can be obtained analytically , it behaves as radiation @xmath104 .",
    "that is the expected result considering the behaviour of the same case without gauge - fixing term , see fig .",
    "[ figg ] .      in the abelian case ( or @xmath105 ) we can obtain the exact expression for the average equation of state by following the virial method despite @xmath31 . using ( [ vir ] ) and",
    "( [ vircero ] ) and the equations of motion ( [ eomgaut ] ) and ( [ eomgaus ] ) , we have : @xmath106 and the average energy density can be written as @xmath107 using ( [ eomgaut ] ) and neglecting time derivatives of the scale factor , we see that the last term vanishes and finally we get : @xmath108    then using ( [ vtemporal1 ] ) and ( [ vtemporal2 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath109 introducing this expression in ( [ omegatemp ] ) , we reach the same result as @xcite for a scalar field and @xcite for an abelian theory without gauge - fixing term : @xmath110      for non - abelian theories we must compute the average of the potential and the energy density in ( [ omegatemp ] ) . as commented before , we can not apply the virial theorem as in the abelian case for simple power law potentials because now some non - abelian terms ( those multiplied by @xmath111 ) act as additional potential terms .",
    "thus the effective potential becomes a sum of power laws , and @xmath112 is not proportional to @xmath70 . in any case , if we assume @xmath113 , we can constrain the value of @xmath77 : @xmath114      let us consider the case in which the only relevant component of the homogeneous yang - mills theory with a gauge - fixing term ( i.e. @xmath116 ) is the temporal part of the fields , @xmath117 the equations of motion become : @xmath118 with no contribution from the non - abelian terms .",
    "this equation is similar to the standard scalar field equation , although with variable mass depending on the scale factor derivatives .",
    "however the non - zero components of the energy - momentum tensor are completely different , @xmath119 adding them : @xmath120 where in the last step the equations of motion have been used",
    ". we can give an expression for the equation of state : @xmath121 now the oscillatory behaviour is not required as the isotropy is guaranteed , so for a simple power - law potential , we get : @xmath122 we see that contrary to the scalar field standard behaviour , when the potential dominates @xmath123 ; whereas @xmath124 when the potential term is negligible . when the field is rapidly oscillating , we can use the virial equations ( [ vireom ] ) and the average @xmath77 behaves as a standard scalar field @xmath125 since @xmath126 as it can be straightforwardly deduced from eq . ( [ vtemporal1 ] ) .",
    "this does not mean that the temporal component becomes a standard scalar field , but that in average its equation of state behaviour is the same . a good way to illustrate",
    "this is by studying the case @xmath127 and its equivalent @xmath128 for a scalar field .",
    "the conditions to have oscillations are @xmath129 and @xmath130 . in this particular case",
    ", the pressure behaves completely different when the field is a scalar , a temporal component or a spatial component of a vector field ; although , in average they behave in the same way .    in figure",
    "[ figpressure ] , the different cases are shown for @xmath50 in a radiation - dominated universe . for a scalar field , the pressure will oscillate in the interval @xmath131 , so pressure is modulated by energy density .",
    "if we have a spatial component of a vector field ( @xmath30 ) , the average pressure over the three spatial directions @xmath96 always equals @xmath132 , and it does not oscillate .",
    "this odd behaviour can be explained by realising that the trace of the energy - momentum tensor ( [ trace ] ) vanishes for this potential if the temporal component is zero , then @xmath133 must be satisfied at any time . finally for a temporal component of a vector field ( @xmath134 )",
    ", pressure oscillations exceed the energy density value on the contrary to the scalar case .",
    "the previous results can be directly extended to general space - time geometries ( not necessarily homogeneous ) as was shown in @xcite .",
    "thus , let us consider a locally inertial observer at @xmath135 and write the metric tensor using riemann normal coordinates around @xmath136 @xcite : @xmath137 let assume that the following conditions hold :    1 .",
    "the lagrangian is restricted to the yang - mills form with or without a gauge - fixing term .",
    "the vector field evolves rapidly : @xmath138 for any component of the riemann tensor .",
    "@xmath139 is the characteristic frequency of @xmath140 3 .",
    "@xmath140 and @xmath141 remain bounded in the evolution .",
    "the second condition implies that if we are only interested in time scales of order @xmath142 , then we are in a normal neighbourhood and we can neglect the second term in ( [ normal ] ) and also work with a homogeneous vector field .",
    "in such a case , it is possible to rewrite all the above equations with @xmath143 .",
    "thus , by using an interval @xmath33 $ ] that verifies the condition : @xmath144 ) and prove that the mean value of the energy - momentum tensor is isotropic .",
    "thus , if oscillations are fast compared to the curvature scale , the average energy - momentum tensor takes the perfect fluid form for any locally inertial observer .",
    "in this work we have considered homogeneous non - abelian vector fields in an expanding universe with arbitrary potential term . by means of a generalized version of the virial theorem ,",
    "we have shown that for bounded and rapid evolution compared to the rate of expansion , the average energy - momentum tensor is isotropic for any kind of initial configuration of the fields .",
    "this result holds irrespective of the complicated dynamics of the coupled fields in non - abelian theories even in the presence of gauge - fixing terms , and it can be extended for any locally inertial observer in arbitrary geometries provided the field evolution is sufficiently rapid .",
    "these rapidly oscillating vector field models not only avoid the problem of anisotropies at the classical level as shown in this work , but also could solve it even in the presence of quantum fluctuations . indeed , they open up the possibility of using non - abelian fields in cosmology beyond the simple triad configurations considered so far . notice that light vector fields during inflation develop a classical homogeneous vacuum expectation value due to the sum of infrared modes .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the fields in the triad will not be correlated generally and will break isotropy @xcite . however , in the cases considered in this work , the high effective mass of vector perturbations compared to the rate of expansion prevents the long - wavelenght modes from being excited , thus avoiding the problem of anistropy even at the quantum level .",
