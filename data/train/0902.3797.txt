    "the application of magnetic feshbach resonances ( fr ) @xcite and of optical photoassociation ( pa ) @xcite , oftentimes in combination , within an atomic bose - einstein condensate can result in the creation of diatomic @xcite as well as of more complex molecules , as evidenced by recent experimental observations of transient efimov trimer states cs@xmath1 @xcite and of the molecular tetramer cs@xmath2 ( indirectly via resonances in inelastic processes ) @xcite .",
    "we also mention the important work of ling @xmath3 @xcite , who proposed to use a chirped coupling field to compensate the effects of nonlinear collisions within the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) technique @xcite and thus to efficiently generate large amounts of deeply bound ultracold molecules .",
    "this is an extension of previous developments in associative stirap ( see , e.g. early work by mackie and coworkers @xcite ) , that is particularly relevant in the context of the present paper .",
    "the atom - molecule dark states involved in such a process was first realized experimentally via coherent two - color pa @xcite in an early example of what is now called superchemistry @xcite .    over the past ten years",
    ", ultracold matter - wave superchemistry has focused on coherent association or dissociation reactions @xcite between atoms and diatomic molecules .",
    "for example , moore and vardi @xcite studied the possibility of an almost complete bose - enhanced channel selectivity in the coherent photodissociation of bosonic triatomic @xmath4 molecules , resulting from the interplay between bose enhancement and competition between modes for a finite number of initial molecules .",
    "other recent examples include work on the dependence of dissociation on the size or shape of the reaction vessel ( confinement effect ) @xcite and the assembly of fermi - degenerate dimers via cooperative association @xcite .",
    "the present paper extends the toolbox of superchemistry to the coherent abstraction reaction ( or bimolecular reactive scattering ) @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote either bosonic or fermionic atoms or dimers .",
    "this reaction is an important benchmark system in chemical physics .",
    "its dynamics has attracted much interest in recent studies of reactive resonance or low - energy non - born - oppenheimer reactivity through a cross - beam scattering method @xcite .",
    "a particularly noteworthy contribution is the study by shapiro and brumer of the coherent control of single - molecular photoassociation or bimolecular collisions through the interference of reactive pathways @xcite .    extending these considerations to the case of ultracold matter waves ,",
    "we show that the coherent abstraction reaction can be realized efficiently and controlled in a stirap photoassociation pulse sequence @xcite such that the intermediate states are dark states .",
    "an important characteristic of this process is that it is triggered by quantum noise , leading to large shot - to - shot quantum fluctuations that invalidate the use of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) in the initial stages .",
    "that equation can be used only at later times when the product reactant channels become macroscopically occupied .",
    "this is somewhat similar to a situation familiar in a number of quantum and atom optics examples such as the laser @xcite , optical and matter - wave superradiance @xcite , and molecular matter - wave amplifier @xcite , and is in contrast to the familiar single - molecular @xcite combination reaction .    in realizing the collective reaction @xmath9",
    ", the basic idea is to first create weakly bound trimers @xmath10 via an entrance - channel atom - dimer fr , and then to dissociate them into a closed - channel bound dimer and atom via photodissociation .",
    "a key aspect of that scheme is that involving a trimer intermediate state allows one to exploit a coherent population trapping ( cpt ) state that prevents the trimer population from becoming significant throughout the conversion process .",
    "such an atom - molecule state does @xmath11 exist in other schemes that involve @xmath12 an intermediate two - species atomic state .",
    "note also that this scheme , which is specific to quantum - degenerate matter waves , is different from a purely collision - induced reaction @xcite and from the non - degenerate single - pair dynamics of reactive scattering @xcite . as such it represents a promising advance in the on - going development of superchemistry @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section ii discusses our model and analyzes the initial stages of the coherent bimolecular reaction .",
    "the resulting quantum fluctuations determine the initial statistical properties of the mean - field evolution that takes over once the various matter - wave fields are macroscopically populated .",
    "this is discussed in sec .",
    "iii , where we numerically compute a large number of trajectories from initial classical seeds satisfying these short - time statistics .",
    "we also review how an approximate cpt dark state required for the stirap pulse sequence can be achieved in the presence of mean - field shifts .",

    "several generalizations , including the role of population imbalance , are considered in sec .",

    "cpt and stirap rely explicitly on the validity of the adiabatic theorem , which applies only to linear systems . while there have been many previous developments in associative stirap ( see e.g. ref .",

    "this question was recently investigated by pu and coworkers in ref . [ 16 ] for a model of coherent atom - dimer conversion , and an approximate adiabatic condition was obtained by linearizing the nonlinear system around the intended adiabatic evolution .",
    "in that context , the analytical form of the nonlinear adiabatic condition derived in the collisionless limit turns out to be useful in determining the required laser parameters @xcite .",
