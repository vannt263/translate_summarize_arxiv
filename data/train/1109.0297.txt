    "we are in a golden age for the search for high redshift galaxies , located at the beginning of the cosmic dawn .",
    "this progress has been made possible by a combination of state of the art instruments and sophisticated selection techniques .",
    "the sensitivity of instruments such as the recently installed wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , the subaru and keck telescopes , have been instrumental in pushing to faint magnitudes , in an effort to search for the first galaxies .",
    "this has been complemented by refined selection methods including the dropout - technique introduced by steidel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; the band in which a galaxy ` drops - out ' of visibility is used as an indicator of the lyman break at low redshifts and the break bluewards of the ly@xmath14 line at high - redshifts ( corresponding to 912  and 1216  in the rest frame respectively ) , to estimate the galaxy redshift .",
    "though this method has been extremely useful in identifying high-@xmath4 lbgs , it has the drawback that the exact source redshift can not be estimated with complete confidence .",
    "an alternate strategy for finding high-@xmath4 galaxies is the narrow - band technique ( e.g. malhotra et al .",

    "ouchi et al . 2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "the foremost advantage in using such galaxies , called laes , is that the observed wavelength of the ly@xmath14 line can be used to place stringent constraints on the source redshift .",

    "the resolution needed to study the faint end , however , meant that only a relatively small cosmological volume of @xmath39 could be simulated .",
    "in addition to the nature of these pristine galaxies , an urgent question that needs to be addressed is the relationship between lbgs and laes , which remains ambiguous as a result of the different observational selection techniques used to detect these two high-@xmath4 galaxy populations .",
    "gawiser et al . ( 2006 ) suggest laes are less massive and less dusty compared to lbgs , and that laes represent the beginning of an evolutionary sequence in which galaxies increase their mass through mergers and dust through star formation .",
    "this is in agreement with the work of pentericci et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2010 ) : although they find laes to be less massive and less dust enriched with respect to lbgs , they find no appreciable difference in the age of lbgs with / without ly@xmath14 emission .",

    "( 2010 ) ; these authors find laes to be older , less dusty and lower in star formation compared to lbgs .",
    "they conclude that laes represent a later stage of galaxy evolution in which sn - driven outflows have have reduced the interstellar medium ( ism ) dust covering fraction .",

    "these irac ( infrared array camera ) detected laes are older and more massive than the irac undetected sample , which leads these authors to suggest that the irac detected laes may be a low mass extension of the lbg population .",

    ", the picture has remained equally unclear . while considerable efforts have been devoted to using @xmath44 laes as probes of reionization and galaxy evolution ( e.g. santos 2004 ; dijkstra et al .",

    "one such effort has been presented in shimizu & umemura ( 2010 ) who propose that two kinds of galaxies could be visible as laes : early starbursts in young galaxies , or delayed starbursts in evolved galaxies .",
    "these authors further claim that lbgs showing a strong ly@xmath14 line could possibly include the latter type of laes .    in this work ,",
    "our first aim is to simulate the galaxies that populate the entire observed lbg uv lf at @xmath45 , ranging from galaxies as faint as @xmath46 to those as bright as @xmath47 , to reproduce their observed data sets including the uv lfs , @xmath2 , the stellar mass function , the ssfr and the sfr density , thereby pinning down their elusive physical properties .",
    "to this aim , we use state of the art cosmological simulations with the same treatment of the metal enrichment and sn feedback , as in salvaterra , ferrara & dayal ( 2011 ) .",
    "however , to capture the large luminosity range required , we use much larger simulation boxes , such that the volume probed is @xmath48 .",
    "secondly , the simulations used in this work have already been used extensively ( dayal et al . 2009 ; dayal , ferrara & saro 2010 ) to study the nature of @xmath20 laes and have successfully reproduced a number of lae data sets including the ly@xmath14 and uv lfs , their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and ly@xmath14 ews , to name a few . in this work ,",

    "then , for the first time , we would be able to compare the physical properties of lbgs and laes , identified from the same underlying galaxy population , to study the connection between these two galaxy classes in a self - consistent framework .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",

    "the code also includes an effective model to describe self - regulated star formation in a multi - phase ism and a prescription for galactic winds triggered by sn explosions , springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) . in their model , star formation occurs due to collapse of condensed clouds embedded in an ambient hot gas .",

    "galaxies are recognized as gravitationally bound groups of star particles by running a standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm , decomposing each fof group into a set of dis - jointed substructures and identifying these using the subfind algorithm ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ) . after performing a gravitational unbinding procedure , only sub - halos with at least 20 bound particles",

    "both the ly@xmath14 and continuum photons so produced are susceptible to absorption by dust grains present in the ism ; only a fraction @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) of the ly@xmath14 ( continuum ) photons produced emerge out of the galaxy undamped by dust .",
    "dust is produced both by sn and evolved stars in a galaxy . however , several authors ( todini & ferrara 2001 ; dwek et al .",
    "2007 , valiante et al .",
    "2009 ) have shown that the contribution of agb stars becomes progressively less important towards higher redshifts ( @xmath71 ) since the typical evolutionary time - scale of these stars ( @xmath72 gyr ) becomes longer than the age of the universe above that redshift .",
    "we therefore make the hypothesis that the dust present in galaxies at @xmath73 is produced solely by snii .",
    "the total dust mass present in each galaxy is then computed assuming : ( i ) @xmath74 of dust is produced per snii ( todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa et al .",

    "the ly@xmath14 photons that escape out of the galactic environment are further attenuated by the in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and only a fraction @xmath86 reaches the observer . in turn",
    "the number density at a given redshift depends on the assumed reionization history , which we have taken according to the early reionization model ( erm ; gallerani et al .",
    "such reionization history explains a number of lae and qso observations ( see dayal et al . 2008 ; gallerani et al .",
    "2008ab ) , which are used to fix the fraction @xmath87 at @xmath88 respectively .",
    "we then compute the radius of the region each galaxy is able to ionize around itself depending on its age and sfr , using @xmath64 as mentioned before .",
    "however , in reality , multiple galaxies generally contribute ionizing photons to the same ionized region due to source clustering .",
    "the size of this `` collective '' region is therefore larger and the photoionization rate inside it includes the direct radiation from the galaxy under consideration , those clustered around it and residing in the collective hii region , and the uv background .",
    "this procedure , described in detail in dayal & ferrara ( 2011 ) , was carried out for each galaxy in the simulated volume .",
    "assuming photoionization equilibrium within the effective ionized region of each galaxy and forcing @xmath89 to attain the assigned global value at the edge of this region , we used the voigt profile to calculate the optical depth , and hence @xmath90 for ly@xmath14 photons along the line of sight .",
    "the observed ly@xmath14 luminosity for each galaxy is then calculated as @xmath91 .      when compared to the standard sheth - tormen mass function ( sheth & tormen 1999 ) , the simulated mass function is complete for halo mass @xmath92 in the entire redshift range of interest , i.e. @xmath93 ; galaxies above this mass cut - off are referred to as the `` complete sample '' . at each simulated redshift , @xmath45 , in consistency with the current observational criteria , galaxies from the `` complete sample '' with an absolute magnitude @xmath1",

    "indeed this is not a surprise since observationally , both the amplitude and shape of the lae uv lfs coincides perfectly with that observed for lbgs between @xmath100 to @xmath101 , at @xmath99 ; this agreement has already been pointed out and discussed in detail in shimasaku et al .",
    "such agreement hints at the fact that laes and lbgs are similar galaxy populations ( at least in the above uv magnitude range ) .",
    "we now return to the discussion regarding the lbg lfs where we find that the theoretical lfs shift towards lower luminosity or decreasing @xmath102 with increasing redshift , mimicking a pure luminosity or density evolution .",
    "the value of the best - fit schechter parameters to the theoretical lfs can be quantified by a characteristic magnitude @xmath103 and slope @xmath104 for @xmath88 which , within errors , are consistent with the values @xmath105 and @xmath106 derived by bouwens et al .",

    "2 ; the decrease in the mass function is probably an artifact of such resolution issues .",

    "this value is computed by summing the intrinsic sfr of all lbgs whose observed luminosity is larger than @xmath149 ( corresponding to @xmath150 at @xmath151 ) and dividing this sum by the total simulated volume .",

    "this apparently puzzling result might be the smoking gun of downsizing : whereas more massive galaxies formed large amounts of stars in a short time interval which quenched later star formation , dwarf galaxies built up their stellar budget more gradually .",
    "thus , by the time the sfr is roughly similar for the two populations , more massive galaxies already contain a large amount of stellar mass , and are therefore characterized by a lower ssfr .",
    "this trend appears to hold at all redshifts , as seen from fig .",

    "[ table1 ] .",
    "such a trend is easily explained combining the fact that galaxies shift to progressively lower halo ( and stellar ) masses with redshift ( see fig .",
    "[ mass_fn ] ) and as mentioned above , the ssfr rises with decreasing stellar mass .",
    "having identified the simulated galaxies that would be observationally selected as lbgs , and shown that they reproduce a number of observed data sets , we can now compare their properties with those of the laes previously found in the same simulations .",
    "we start by considering the stellar mass , @xmath144 , which is possibly the best constrained physical quantity available for high-@xmath4 galaxies when near - ir data is available .",
    "we find that for galaxies brighter than @xmath163 at @xmath88 , laes and lbgs show very similar values of @xmath144 in a given @xmath36 bin . the stellar mass and uv magnitude",
    "are tightly coupled at each redshift ; galaxies with the largest @xmath144 ( and hence @xmath61 ; see fig .",
    "7 of dayal et al .",
    "2009 ) are the most uv luminous , implying that although dust obscuration can modify the slope of the sfr - uv luminosity relation , it can not alter its monotonic trend .",
    "a persistent evolutionary feature is that the lbg population extends to lower stellar masses / fainter luminosities : this is because the smallest galaxies do not produce enough ly@xmath14 to be visible as laes , according to the adopted selection criterion ( @xmath94 and @xmath164  ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath144 ranges shift to progressively lower values with redshift ( see also sec . [ massfn ] ) for both laes and lbgs , as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario ; at @xmath6 the stellar masses for lbgs ( laes ) range between @xmath165 , while they shift down to @xmath166 at @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "[ phy ] ) .",
    "the lae stellar mass range evolves faster than that for lbgs , due to the combined effects of dust and reionization , as explained in sec .",

    "similar considerations hold for the stellar ages , @xmath59 , of the two populations , as they are found to be very similar in any given absolute magnitude bin for @xmath163 at @xmath88 , further pointing to the tight relation between these two types of galaxies .",
    "both lbgs and laes are composed of intermediate age systems , with @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) at @xmath6 ( 8) , as seen from panels ( d)-(f ) of fig .",
    "as expected , the average @xmath59 decreases with redshift ; in agreement with the downsizing scenario advocated above , larger systems are more dominated by older populations than smaller systems . finally , the galaxies brightest in the uv are on average the oldest , by virtue of their largest @xmath144 values .    finally , as shown in panels ( g)-(i ) of fig .",
    "[ phy ] , both laes and lbgs have nearly identical dust masses ( again , apart from the faintest magnitude bins ) , as a result of their overlapping stellar masses and ages .",

    "finally , as expected , the dust content of galaxies increases with @xmath144 ( decreasing @xmath36 ) ; the brightest galaxies have formed the largest amount of stars over a longer period of time compared to smaller systems .    from the above discussion",
    ", we conclude that high - redshift sources identified as laes and lbgs essentially sample the same underlying galaxy population ; however , laes represent a _ subset _ of a larger lbg sample in the sense that only the faintest lbgs do not show an observable ly@xmath14 line .",
    "we clarify that laes are neither younger / less dusty / smaller nor older / more dusty / larger as compared to lbgs , but rather a wide range of lbgs show an observable ly@xmath14 line . indirectly ,",

    "finally , we caution the reader that the overlap between the lae and lbg populations depends sensitively on redshift dependent observational selection criterion such as the uv magnitude , ly@xmath14 flux and ew limits , used to select these two populations ; the results found in this work which suggest laes to be a subset of lbgs might not necessarily hold true for data sets at other redshifts selected using different selection criterion .",
    "this point has already been made in a number of previous works : ouchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown that the fraction of lbgs showing a ly@xmath14 line depends on the ly@xmath14 ew cut imposed at any given redshift , verhamme et al .",

    "also , dijkstra & wyithe ( 2011 ) have pointed out that simulating laes using simple cuts in ew and uv magnitude lead to uncertainties in the predicted lae number densities .",
    "as explained in sec . [ simu ] , while both ly@xmath14 and continuum photons are attenuated by ism dust , the igm ionization state only affects the observed ly@xmath14 luminosity , leaving the observed continuum luminosity unchanged ; a decrease in the observed ew with increasing redshift could then possibly indicate an increasingly neutral igm , a test proposed by various authors ( e.g. stark et al .",
    "we now discuss both the intrinsic and observed ly@xmath14 ews for the laes and lbgs identified at each of the simulated redshifts .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ phy_prop ] , for a given @xmath36 value , both @xmath59 and @xmath63 shift to progressively lower values with increasing redshift , for both laes and lbgs . since the stellar spectra of younger , more metal - poor populations are harder ( i.e. stars produces more ionizing photons ) the value of @xmath172 increases with redshift for any uv magnitude bin ; for the same reasons , fainter galaxies exhibit larger @xmath172 values at all redshifts .",
    "such trends hold for both laes and lbgs by virtue of their nearly identical physical properties , as shown in panels ( a)-(c ) of fig .",
    "[ ewint ] .",
    "quantitatively , the range of @xmath173 ( brightest to faintest galaxies ) at @xmath6 and increases to @xmath174  at @xmath10 .    before we discuss the observed ews , we recall that the following relation holds : @xmath175 , where @xmath90 is the transmissivity of ly@xmath14 photons through the igm . at @xmath176 , according to the early reionization model that best fits the observations , the fraction is @xmath177 ; this largely ionized igm results in transmissivity values constrained in the narrow range @xmath178 , from the smallest to the largest laes ( see also fig .",
    "3 , dayal et al .",
    "2009 ) . at @xmath179 , instead , the more neutral igm ( @xmath180 ) substantially and preferentially damps ly@xmath14 photons from the smallest galaxies which therefore become undetected in narrow band observations ; the transmissivity decreases globally to @xmath181 .",
    "further , we remind the reader that have used @xmath182 at @xmath88 , where @xmath183 is the galaxy halo mass and @xmath184 , as required to best reproduce the amplitudes of the cumulative lae ly@xmath14 lfs . when taken together , these facts result in the value of @xmath185 rising smoothly from @xmath186 at @xmath187 to @xmath188 , at @xmath189 , at @xmath6 . however , the value of @xmath185 is much flatter at @xmath8 as a result of the lower escape fraction of ly@xmath14 photons from the ism , compared to that for the continuum photons ( @xmath190 ) required to match the lae lfs .",
    "finally , at @xmath10 , the trend reverses , with the smallest galaxies showing the smallest @xmath185 , as a result of their strongly reduced ly@xmath14 transmission through a partially neutral igm .",
    "given the above discussion , is then clear that reionization is the key factor ( but by no means the only one ) regulating the relative fraction of observed lbgs and laes . with our results at hand",

    "for example , using keck spectroscopy of about 600 lbgs in the range @xmath191 , stark et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find that the least luminous lbgs most often show ly@xmath14 emission with @xmath192 . to compare to such observations , we select all lbgs that would be identified as laes with @xmath192 , at each of the redshifts considered .",

    "[ rat ] ; qualitatively our results broadly agree with those of stark et al .",
    ". however , at higher redshifts we find only extremely few ( @xmath33 ) or no ( @xmath34 ) laes with @xmath193 due to the low escape fraction of ly@xmath14 and increasing igm opacity , as explained above .",
    "these combined effects lead to a negligible fraction of laes being found amongst @xmath194 lbgs in our model .",
    "however , the most often adopted ew cut corresponds to @xmath195 . using this value",
    ", we find that within the range @xmath47 to @xmath101 , all lbgs would be classified as laes at @xmath6 .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , given that the amplitudes of both the lae and lbg uv lfs match perfectly within this range , as has already been pointed out by shimasaku et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and discussed in detail by ouchi et al .",
    "the magnitude range of lbgs showing a ly@xmath14 line decreases with redshift : the smallest galaxies do not even produce enough ly@xmath14 , as mentioned before ; the fraction of the largest lbgs showing ly@xmath14 emission progressively decreases with redshift due to the dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath183 explained above .",
    "further , the decrease in the fraction of lbgs showing ly@xmath14 emission between @xmath93 shown above , has recently also been found in observational data by both pentericci et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and schenker et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ; these authors find that the fraction of lbgs showing ly@xmath14 emission drops between @xmath176 , which they interpret as a sign of the igm becoming progressively neutral ( see also fontana et al .",
    "2010 and vanzella et al .",
    "we reiterate that although we see such a trend , between @xmath176 it is driven predominantly by the dust distribution ( which governs the ratio @xmath85 ) ; between @xmath196 on the other hand , this trend arises due to a combination of the dust distribution , and the igm being more neutral .    as a final note of caution , we restate that results regarding the ly@xmath14 ews depend sensitively on a number of assumptions and modeling of poorly understood physical processes , namely : ( a ) we have used a luminosity - independent value of @xmath85 , for all galaxies at a given redshift .",
    "this is empirically fixed by normalizing the theoretical lae lfs to the observed ones . while a number of works ( neufeld 1991 , hansen & oh 2006 ) have emphasized that such ratio depends on the dust distribution ( i.e. homogeneous / clumped ) in galaxies , at the moment , essentially no experimental hint is available at high-@xmath4 on this aspect ; ( b ) the effects of peculiar velocities in calculating @xmath90 have not been included ; inflows ( outflows ) blueshift ( redshift ) the ly@xmath14 line , thereby decreasing ( increasing ) @xmath90 .",
    "a further complication arises due to the fact that both these above mentioned effects depend on the line of sight between the lae and the observer .",
    "finally , we note that we have used the stellar mass weighted age and assumed the sfr to be constant over such time period to compute the intrinsic spectrum of each galaxy . however , using the complete star formation history of each galaxy might affect the results presented here .",
    "each of these points is discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "alternatively , the tension between the model and the observations could also arise due to poorly understood biases / selection effects present in the data .",
    "we have extended our previous studies aimed at modeling lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) to the second major population of high-@xmath4 sources , lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , with the final goal of investigating the physical relationship between them . in a set of large ( @xmath197 ) cosmological sph simulations , including a detailed treatment of star formation , feedback , metal enrichment and supernova dust production ,",

    "as for the lae - lbg connection , at @xmath206 , the lae and lbg uv lfs have the same amplitude and slope between @xmath207 ; within this magnitude range all lbgs would be identified as laes and vice - versa , according to the selection criteria usually adopted ( see sec .",
    ". however , the lbg magnitude range is more extended towards fainter luminosity at all redshifts considered .",
    "it follows that laes represent a luminous lbg _ subset _ , whose relative extent depends only on the adopted selection criteria . *",

    "further , the uv range ( fraction of lbgs showing ly@xmath14 emission ) narrows ( decreases ) with increasing redshift .    in spite of the remarkable predictive power of",
    "the theoretical model presented , considerable room for improvements remains .",
    "in fact a number of delicate , albeit reasonable , assumptions have been made as explained throughout the text , which are now summarized .",
    "first , the relative escape fraction of ly@xmath14 to continuum photons , @xmath85 , used is essentially constant at a given redshift with a tiny halo mass dependence , that has been fixed by matching the amplitude of theoretical lae ly@xmath14 lfs to observations .",
    "such ratio sensitively depends on the dust distribution ( homogeneous / clumpy ) in the ism of a galaxy .",
    "while all existing extinction curves ( sn , calzetti , milky way ) assume dust to be homogeneously distributed to find @xmath212 , the ratio can be boosted to @xmath213 if dust is clumped in the ism , as shown by neufeld ( 1991 ) and hansen & oh ( 2006 ) .",
    "modeling of this process is beyond the capabilities of the present study since the large cosmological volumes required to achieve sufficient galaxy population statistics do not allow us to treat fine ism details .    secondly , the observed ly@xmath14 luminosity also depends on the peculiar velocities which have not been included in our calculation ; inflows / outflows into / from the galaxy can blueshift / redshift the ly@xmath14 line , thereby decreasing / increasing @xmath90 ( verhamme et al .",
    "2006 ; dayal , maselli & ferrara 2011 ) . however , the extent to which peculiar velocities influence @xmath90 is debatable since these calculations have mostly been performed under idealized situations .",

    "( 2007 ) and references therein , have shown that kelvin - helmholtz instabilities would result in breaking - up such symmetric outflows .",
    "thirdly , both observationally and theoretically , the dependence of @xmath214 on the halo mass and redshift have been hugely debated with the values obtained by different groups ranging between @xmath215 ( e.g. ricotti & shull 2003 ; gnedin et al .",
