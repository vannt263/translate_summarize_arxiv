    "most of galactic cosmic rays up to at least the knee energy of @xmath4ev , are believed to be accelerated at snrs within our galaxy by diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in dsa theory , a small fraction of incoming thermal particles can be injected into the cr population , and accelerated to very high energies through their interactions with resonantly scattering alfvn waves in the converging flows across the shock @xcite .",
    "kinetic simulations of the cr acceleration at snrs have shown that up to 50 % of explosion energy can be converted to crs , when a fraction @xmath5 of incoming thermal particles are injected into the cr population at the gas subshock @xcite .",
    "this should be enough to replenish the galactic crs escaping from our galaxy with @xmath6 .",
    "multi - band observations of nonthermal radio to @xmath7-ray emissions from several snrs have been successfully explained by efficient dsa features such as high degree of shock compression and the possible magnetic field amplification in the precursor @xcite .",
    "high - resolution x - ray observations of several young snrs exhibit very thin rims , indicating the presence of magnetic fields as strong as a few @xmath8 g downstream of the shock @xcite .",
    "moreover , theoretical studies have shown that efficient magnetic field amplification via resonant and non - resonant wave - particle interactions is an integral part of dsa @xcite . in the downstream region",
    "magnetic fields can be amplified by turbulence that is induced through cascade of vorticity generated behind curved shocks @xcite .",
    "if there exist such amplified magnetic fields in the upstream region of snrs , cr ions with change @xmath9 might gain energies up to @xmath10 ev , which may explain the all - particle cr spectrum up to the second knee at @xmath11 ev with rigidity - dependent energy cutoffs .",
    "it has been recognized , however , that the cr spectrum at sources , @xmath12 with @xmath13 , predicted based on the nonlinear dsa may be too flat to be consistent with the observed flux of cr nuclei at earth , @xmath14 .",
    "assuming an energy - dependent propagation path length ( @xmath15 ) , a softer source spectrum with @xmath16 , is preferred by the observed data @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy could be reconciled if one consider the drift of scattering centers with respect to the bulk plasma @xcite .",
    "it reduces the velocity jump that the particles experience across the shock , which in turn softens the cr spectrum beyond the canonical test - particle slope @xcite .    using the spherical crash ( cosmic - ray amr shock ) code ,",
    "we have calculated the cr spectrum accelerated at snrs from type ia sne expanding into a uniform interstellar medium .",
    "in the kinetic equation approach to numerical study of dsa , the following diffusion - convection equation for the particle momentum distribution , @xmath17 , is solved along with suitably modified gasdynamic equations @xmath18 \\left ( { \\partial g\\over \\partial y } -4 g \\right )   + { 1 \\over r^2}{\\partial \\over \\partial r } \\left[r^2 \\kappa(r , y ) { \\partial g \\over \\partial r}\\right ] , \\label{diffcon}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the pitch angle averaged cr distribution , @xmath21 is the wave speed , and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the diffusion coefficient parallel to the field lines @xcite",
    ".    the basic gasdynamic equations and details of the spherical crash code can be found in @xcite .",
    "the advection term of eq .",
    "( [ diffcon ] ) is solved by the wave - propagation method , as for the gasdynamic variables , except that only the entropy wave applies .",
    "then the diffusion term is solved by the semi - implicit crank - nicholson scheme . in order to implement the shock tracking and amr ( adoptive mesh refinement ) techniques effectively in a spherical geometry",
    ", we solve the fluid and diffusion - convection equations in a comoving frame that expands with the outer shock .",
    "since the shock is at rest and tracked accurately as a true discontinuity , we can refine the region around the gas subshock at an arbitrarily fine level .",
    "moreover , the shock remains at the same location in the comoving grid , so the compression rate is applied consistently to the cr distribution at the subshock .",
    "this results in much more accurate and efficient low energy cr acceleration and faster numerical convergence on coarser grid spacings , compared to the simulations in a fixed , eulerian grid .",

    "phenomenological _ injection scheme , in which particles above a certain injection momentum @xmath41 cross the subshock and get injected to the cr population @xcite .",
    "one free parameter controls this process ; @xmath42 , the ratio of the general magnetic field along the shock normal , @xmath43 , to the amplitude of postshock mhd wave turbulence , @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this parameter controls the fraction of particles injected into the cr population , @xmath45 , at the gas subshock . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite showed that the protons can be injected efficiently even at perpendicular shocks in fully turbulent fields due to field line meandering .    assuming that particles are resonantly scattered by self - generated waves , we adopt a bohm - like diffusion model that represent a saturated wave spectrum , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "the scattering by alfvn waves tends to isotropize the cr distribution in the wave frame , which may drift upstream at the alfvn speed , @xmath48 , with respect to the bulk plasma flow , where @xmath43 is the amplified magnetic field strength @xcite . in the postshock region , @xmath49 is assumed , since the alfvnic turbulence in that region is probably relatively balanced .",
    "this alfvnic drift reduces the velocity difference between upstream and downstream scattering centers compared to the bulk flow , leading to less efficient dsa .",
    "so the ` modified ' test - particle slope can be estimated as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the downstream flow speed @xcite .",
    "hereafter we use the subscripts 0 , 1 , and 2 to denote conditions far upstream , immediately upstream and downstream of the subshock , respectively .",
    "thus the drift of alfvn waves in the upstream region tends to soften the cr spectrum from the canonical test - particle spectrum of @xmath52 , if the alfvn mach number ( @xmath53 ) is small .",
    "-0.5 cm -3.0 cm    -0.5 cm    in addition , gas heating due to alfvn wave dissipation in the upstream region is considered by the term @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the cr pressure .",
    "this term is derived from a simple model in which alfvn waves are amplified by streaming crs and dissipated locally as heat in the precursor region .",
    "this effect reduces the subshock mach number thereby reducing dsa efficiency @xcite .",
    "we consider a type ia sn explosion with the ejecta mass , @xmath56 , expanding into a uniform ism .",
    "all models have the explosion energy , @xmath57 ergs .",
    "the shock sonic mach number is the key parameter determining the evolution and the dsa efficiency , while the particle injection rate and magnetic field strength ( through @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) are secondary parameters .",
    "so here three phases of the ism are considered : the _ warm phase _ with @xmath60k ( wism ) , the _ intermediate phase _ with @xmath61k ( mism ) , and",
    "the _ hot phase _ with @xmath62k ( hism ) .",
    "the presence of amplified magnetic fields a few @xmath63 g downstream of shock has been indicated by very thin rims of several young snrs observed in x - ray @xcite . to represent this effect",
    "we take the upstream field strength , @xmath64 g for the wism and mism models . for the hism model ,",
    "however , the snr shock is much weaker and not dominated by the cr pressure , so the filed amplification should be minimal .",
    "thus the mean ism field of @xmath65 g is adopted .",
    "the physical quantities are normalized by the following constants : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",

    "figure 1 shows the time evolution of the wism model with @xmath72 .",
    "the injection is very efficient with @xmath73 , the shock becomes dominated by @xmath55 and the total density compression peaks at @xmath74 at @xmath75 .",
    "afterward , the cr acceleration becomes less efficient as the shock slows down and becomes weaker .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of shock properties in the different models . in the models with @xmath76 ( solid lines ) , the cr injection and acceleration are inefficient with the injected cr fraction , @xmath77 , and the postshock cr pressure , @xmath78 through out the entire sedov - taylor ( st ) stage . in such inefficient acceleration regime",

    "these two ratios decrease in time , since both the sonic and alfvnic mach numbers decrease .",
    "the wism model is the more efficient accelerator than the hism model , because of the higher sonic mach number . despite the lower sonic mach number , in the hism model",
    "the cr acceleration is more efficient , compared to the mism model , because of weaker alfvnic drift effects due to lower @xmath43",

    "the cutoff momentum @xmath86 approaches up to @xmath87 ev / c .",
    "we note that , if the shock follows the sedov - taylor solution , the cutoff momentum asymptotes to @xmath88 at large @xmath89 , which corresponds to @xmath90 ev for the wism model . even for the inefficient injection cases with @xmath91 the cr spectrum at the shock exhibit concave curvatures as a consequence of momentum dependent diffusion across the precursor and slowing - down of the spherical shock .",
    "softening of the spectrum at low energies is further enhanced by the alfvnic drift and weakening of the subshock strength in time , which is more significant in the cases of stronger @xmath43 .",
    "however , the concavity of @xmath92 is much less pronounced than that of @xmath83 . in the inefficient injection models ,",
    "the slope , @xmath93 , varies 4.2 - 4.3 at low momentum and 3.9 - 4.2 at high momentum , and @xmath92 does not changes significantly for @xmath94 , especially for @xmath95 .",
    "this implies that the acceleration is nearly balanced by the adiabatic cooling during the late stage .",
    "so we can predict that the form of @xmath92 would remain roughly the same at much later time . in the efficient injection models with @xmath96 , of course ,",
    "nonlinear feedback effects are more substantial .",

    "the total cr energy accelerated by @xmath101 is @xmath102 0.15 , 0.05 , and 0.08 for wism , mism , and hism models , respectively , for @xmath76 .",
    "these are marginally consistent with the requirement that an order of 10 % of sn explosion energy needs to be converted to crs to replenish the galactic crs . in the efficient injection models with @xmath72 ,",
    "the cr energy fraction approaches to @xmath102 0.45 , 0.25 , and 0.35 for wism , mism , and hism models , respectively .",
    "the cr acceleration in the warm ism model with @xmath72 may be somewhat too efficient .",
    "but one has to recall that the cr injection rate may depend on the mean magnetic field direction relative to the shock surface . in a more realistic magnetic field geometry , where a uniform ism field is swept by the spherical shock",
    ", only 10 - 20 % of the shock surface has a quasi - parallel field geometry @xcite .",
    "moreover , type ia sne make up only about 15 % of sn explosions in the galaxy , while core collapse sne exploding inside wind bubbles may behave differently @xcite .",
    "in general , the dsa is very efficient for strong snr shocks , if the injection fraction is @xmath103 .",
    "the cr spectrum at the subshock shows a strong concavity , not only because the shock structure is modified nonlinearly by the dominant cr pressure , but also because the spherical snr shock slows down in time during the sedov - taylor stage .",
    "thus the concavity of the cr spectrum in snrs is more pronounced than that in plane - parallel shocks .",
    "moreover , the alfvnic drift in the precursor further softens the cr spectrum as the alfvnic mach number decreases .",
    "however , the volume integrated spectrum , @xmath92 ( the spectrum of crs confined by the shock including the particles in the upstream region ) is much less concave . in the test - particle like solutions ,",
    "@xmath92 approaches roughly to time - asymptotic states in the late sedov - taylor stage , since the acceleration is nearly balanced by adiabatic cooling .",
    "if the injection fraction is @xmath96 , about 25 - 45% of the explosion energy is transferred to crs and the source cr spectrum becomes @xmath12 with @xmath104 for @xmath105 ev , which might be too flat to be consistent with the observed cr spectrum at earth @xcite . if @xmath91 , on the other hand , the shock structure is almost test - particle like with @xmath106 and the predicted source spectrum has a slope @xmath107",
    "however , the fraction of cr energy conversion , @xmath108 , might be only marginally consistent with the galactic cr luminosity .",
    "finally , in all models considered in this study , for bohm - like diffusion with the amplified magnetic field in the precursor , the particles could be accelerated to @xmath109ev .",
    "the drift and dissipation of _ faster _ alfvn waves in the precursor , on the other hand , soften the cr spectrum and reduce the cr acceleration efficiency ."
