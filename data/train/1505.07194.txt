    "conventional battery powered wireless communications systems require periodic recharging or replacement of the batteries , which incurs a high operation burden @xcite and can be cumbersome or even impossible ( e.g. , for biomedical devices implanted in the human body @xcite ) .",
    "recently , energy harvesting ( eh ) from the ambient radio - frequency ( rf ) signals has been developed as one of the attractive alternatives to prolong the lifetime of energy - constrained nodes in wireless networks @xcite . the dual use of rf signals for eh and information delivery ( i d ) has led to the novel architecture of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) @xcite , which allows wireless nodes to scavenge energy as well as extract information simultaneously from the rf signals , thus constituting an appealing solution for energy - constrained applications such as wireless relay networks .",
    "practical swipt receiver architectures make use of two different circuits performing eh and i d individually @xcite .",
    "the receiver may either switch between the eh and i d circuits in a time - division fashion , a scheme known as time switching @xcite , or split the received rf signals into two streams fed to the eh and i d circuits at the same time , a scheme known as power splitting @xcite .",
    "typically , eh and i d circuits operate with rather different receiver power sensitivities , i.e. , @xmath1 dbm for information receivers and @xmath2 dbm for energy receivers @xcite . since the eh circuit is designed to maximize the eh efficiency while the i d circuit typically aims for maximum information rate , a fundamental _ rate - energy tradeoff",
    "_ exists for swipt systems @xcite . various resource allocation and beamforming schemes",
    "were designed to achieve different tradeoffs between rate and energy in swipt systems . in particular , the optimum power allocation maximizing the information rate subject to eh constraint was studied for broadband systems with perfect instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) @xcite . the optimum resource allocation with service differentiation between low- and high - priority data was studied for eh networks in @xcite . in @xcite , a joint",
    "optimization and game - theoretic framework was developed to optimize the packet delivery policy and cooperation strategy for delay tolerant networks with eh . moreover , beamforming schemes which maximize the information rate subject to eh constraint or maximize the harvested energy subject to rate constraint were studied under imperfect csi in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "recently , swipt has also been applied in wireless relay systems which allows energy - constrained relay nodes to harvest energy from the source rf signals and consequently brings in substantial benefits in wireless networks @xcite .",
    "various theoretical analysis and practical design have been conducted for eh relay systems in the literature .",
    "specifically , for dual - hop amplify - and - forward ( af ) networks , a greedy switching protocol between data relaying and eh was proposed in @xcite , and the joint relay selection and power allocation scheme was developed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the outage probability and ergodic capacity for eh af relaying were derived for delay - limited and delay - tolerant applications , respectively , in @xcite .",
    "besides af relay systems , the eh has also been considered for decode - and - forward ( df ) networks . in particular ,",
    "the outage probability of eh df relaying was studied , taking into account the spatial randomness of the source - destination pairs , for various network topologies in @xcite .    the aforementioned studies on eh relay systems have either implicitly or explicitly assumed the instantaneous csi availability to allow for _ coherent _ information decoding .",
    "however , the coherent swipt requires the source to periodically send training symbols , which incurs an increased signaling overhead and processing burden .",
    "moreover , the relays may need to relay the training symbols and/or estimate the source - relay channels @xcite , which results in additional energy consumptions and poses serious issues especially for energy - constrained relay nodes . as a remedy",
    ", the _ noncoherent _ swipt eliminating the need for the instantaneous csi was first studied for the eh df relay systems @xcite , where two eh relaying protocols , namely , the power splitting noncoherent df ( ps - ncdf ) and time switching noncoherent df ( ts - ncdf ) were proposed , and the corresponding maximum - likelihood detectors ( mlds ) facilitating noncoherent swipt were obtained . however , these protocols and the detectors are applicable only for the df relay systems .",
    "it is still unknown about how the noncoherent af relaying can benefit from eh , and how the noncoherent af relaying performs as compared to the noncoherent df relaying in eh relay systems .",
    "in addition , for eh af relay systems , the noncoherent mld minimizing the symbol - error rate ( ser ) in noncoherent swipt is still unknown .",
    "realizing that none of the previous works have tackled the design challenges of noncoherent swipt in eh af relay systems , we aim to fill the gap .    in this paper",
    ", we study the _ noncoherent _ eh relay systems consisting of multiple af relays , which can harvest energy from the ambient source signals and utilize the harvested energy to assist the communication .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * for arbitrary @xmath0-ary noncoherent frequency - shift keying ( fsk ) or differential phase - shift keying ( dpsk ) signalings , we propose a unified _ noncoherent _ swipt framework embracing two eh relaying protocols , namely , the power splitting noncoherent af ( ps - ncaf ) and time switching noncoherent af ( ts - ncaf ) . * following the proposed swipt framework , we develop noncoherent mlds for ps - ncaf and ts - ncaf in a _ unified _ form , which involves integral evaluations yet serves as the optimum performance benchmark for noncoherent swipt . to avoid integral computations , we also develop a _ closed - form _ gauss - legendre approximation based detector , which achieves almost identical ser to the mld at substantially lower complexity .",
    "it is demonstrated that the proposed eh - based noncoherent detectors achieve full diversity in rayleigh fading . in terms of the error performance ,",
    "the proposed ps - ncaf and ts - ncaf may outperform conventional grid - powered noncoherent relay systems under the same total power constraint . *",
    "the choice of the time switching or power splitting parameters represents a tradeoff between eh and information transmission , and there exist unique optimum values of these parameters which minimize the ser .",
    "* the number of eh relay nodes is a key factor on the performance of the noncoherent eh relay systems : ps - ncaf outperforms ts - ncaf in the single - relay case , whereas ts - ncaf outperforms ps - ncaf in the multi - relay case .",
    "* the optimum relay position is closer to the source than to the destination , regardless of the eh relaying protocols ( this is in contrast to the conventional self - powered relay systems where the optimum relay position is closer to the destination for af and is closer to the source for df ) .",
    "furthermore , as the path - loss exponent increases , the optimum relay position shifts slightly towards the destination , but is still closer to the source . * the @xmath0-fsk signaling with @xmath3 is a more suitable solution for eh relay systems due to its higher energy efficiency compared to @xmath0-dpsk , regardless of the eh relaying protocols .",
    "* comparison of the af- and df - based eh relaying protocols demonstrates that the ser performance of af and df relaying is almost the same in noncoherent eh relay systems , irrespective of the swipt architecture ( e.g. , power splitting or time switching ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the conventional self - powered relay systems where either af or df may outperform each other depending on the relay locations .",

    "<S> these eh - based noncoherent detectors achieve full diversity in rayleigh fading . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results demonstrate that our proposed ps - ncaf and ts - ncaf may outperform the conventional grid - powered relay system under the same total power constraint . </S>",
