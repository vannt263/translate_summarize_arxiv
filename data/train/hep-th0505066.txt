    "there has been paid much attention to the scenario of gauge - higgs unification @xcite@xcite for the possibility to solve the gauge hierarchy problem without supersymmetry ( susy ) . in this scenario ,",
    "higgs fields are regarded as extra components in the original gauge field .",
    "the higher dimensional local gauge invariance ensures that the higgs field is strictly massless .",
    "if spatial coordinates are compactified , then the extra component gauge field behaves as the scalar field at low energies . and",
    "the scalar field can develop the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) through the dynamics of the wilson line phases , which is called as the hosotani mechanism @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the wilson line phases has been studied from various points of view @xcite . in particular , an attempt to identify the wilson line degrees of freedom with the higgs scalar in the standard model ( or in the minimal susy standard model ) has been explored . since the mass of the higgs scalar in the gauge - higgs unification is calculable , insensitive to the ultraviolet physics and is generated by quantum corrections through the coleman - weinberg mechanism @xcite , so that it is natural to expect that the higgs mass is light , at most , the order of the gauge boson mass .",
    "the general analyses have been made in refs.@xcite@xcite and pointed out that the higgs mass can be as heavy as possible to satisfy the present experimental lower bound of the higgs mass .",
    "the scenario is one of the promising possibility beyond the standard model even though there are many issues that should be studied such as the fermion mass hierarchy problem .",
    "the dynamics of the wilson line phases is essentially the coleman - weinberg mechanism , so that the transition at finite temperature is expected to be the first order @xcite .",
    "in fact , the authors of ref.@xcite extensively studied the nature of the phase transition of the gauge - higgs unification at finite temperature and investigated the origin of the first order phase transition .",
    "they have explicitly demonstrated the first order phase transition in certain models @xcite and shown that the lighter higgs mass gives us the stronger first order phase transition .",
    "the strong first order phase transition is favored from a point of view of the scenario of the electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the gauge - higgs unification at finite temperature in other models , including supersymmetric gauge models , which are different from the ones studied in ref.@xcite . in our model",
    ", there is no need to introduce massive fields , and the matter content is very simple .",
    "we do not consider matter fields belonging to the higher dimensional representation under the gauge group except the adjoint one . in this matter",
    "content , the mass of the higgs scalar can be consistent with the experimental lower bound .",
    "we obtain that the phase transition is the first order and find that the transition is so strong as to satisfy the necessary condition for the electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "we also observe the tendency that heavier the higgs mass becomes , weaker the first order phase transition is .",
    "we calculate the critical temperature at which the two degenerate vacua appear and estimate how strong the phase transition is in our models .",
    "we also find an interesting phenomena for a certain matter content even in the the gauge - higgs unification at finite temperature .",
    "there are two stage phase transitions , which has also been observed in the four dimensional susy model at finite temperature @xcite . in our model at the first critical temperature , the vacuum with the @xmath4 gauge symmetry is degenerate with that respecting the @xmath5 gauge symmetry .",
    "decreasing the temperature further , at the second critical temperature , the vacuum with the @xmath5 gauge symmetry is degenerate with the vacuum with the @xmath6 gauge symmetry .",
    "both phase transitions are the first order at each phase transition .",
    "we also analyze the strength of the phase transition at each critical temperature .",
    "we also study susy models with the scherk - schwarz susy breaking @xcite at finite temperature .",
    "we again find the phase transition to be very strong first order , which is favored from the electroweak baryogenesis . the relevant quantity to measure the strength of the phase transition",
    "is also evaluated .",
    "we also find multi ( four in our case ) phase transition in the susy model with a particular matter content . except for the first phase transition where the vacua with the @xmath4 gauge symmetry and the @xmath6 gauge symmetry are degenerate at the critical temperature , all of these vacua respect the @xmath6 gauge symmetry are degenerate in the rest of the three phase transitions .    in the next section ,",
    "we investigate the behavior of the effective potential for the wilson line phases at finite temperature in our model and show that the phase transition is the first order .",
    "then , we estimate the critical temperature and the strength of the phase transition . the phase transition is found to be very strong and provides us an interesting possibility for the electroweak baryogenesis . in section @xmath7 , we study the case of susy gauge models with the scherk - schwarz susy breaking and study the effective potential for the wilson line phases at finite temperature . for a particular matter content , we find multi phase transition , four stages phase transitions in our case , in which the phase transition is the first order .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "let us consider gauge theory coupled with matter at finite temperature in @xmath8 dimensions , where one of the space coordinate is compactified on an orbifold , @xmath9 .",
    "the space time is regarded as an @xmath10 , where the euclidean time direction @xmath11 is effectively compactified on a circle , @xmath12 whose periodicity is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 stands for the temperature , the radius of the other @xmath12 and its coordinate are denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we decompose the @xmath8 dimensional gauge field @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "when one studies the gauge theory on the space time with boundaries , one needs to specify boundary conditions of fields for the compactified direction . the boundary condition for the euclidean time direction",
    "is determined by quantum statistics , so that one uniquely assigns the ( anti-)periodic boundary condition for ( fermions)bosons , while for the orbifold @xmath9 , we must specify the boundary condition on the two fixed points of the orbifold , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in addition to the @xmath12 direction .",
    "we define that @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the minus sign for @xmath24",
    "is needed to preserve the gauge invariance under these transformations .",
    "since a transformation @xmath25 must be the same as a transformation @xmath26 , we obtain that @xmath27 hereafter , we consider @xmath28 is more fundamental quantity than @xmath29 .",
    "the orbifolding boundary conditions @xmath28 determine the gauge symmetry breaking patterns at the tree level .",
    "in this paper , we start with an @xmath30 gauge group and choose @xmath31 .",
    "since the zero mode field for @xmath32 is given by the generators of @xmath33 commuting with @xmath34 , the @xmath30 breaks down to the @xmath4 gauge group .",
    "we are interested in the gauge symmetry breaking patterns of @xmath4 at finite temperature after taking quantum corrections into account , that is , the phase transition through the dynamics of the wilson line phases at finite temperature .",
    "the wilson line phases for the choice of @xmath35 is given by the zero mode field @xmath36 associated with the @xmath30 generators , @xmath37 , which anticommutes with @xmath34 .",
    "then , the zero mode , @xmath38 transforms as an @xmath39 doublet , so that we can regard @xmath40 as a higgs doublet .",
    "we see that the degrees of freedom of the higgs doublet is embedded in the zero mode part of @xmath24 .",
    "this is the idea of the gauge - higgs unification .",
    "we paramerize @xmath41 , utilizing the @xmath4 degrees of freedom , as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a real parameter .",

    "when one discusses the electroweak baryogenesis , the strength of the phase transition at finite temperature is crucial to satisfy the famous zakharov s conditions .",

    "@xcite , @xcite . ]",
    "hence it may be possible to make use of this first order phase transition for the electroweak baryogenesis in the scenario of gauge - higgs unification .",
    "one should observe that the light higgs mass ( small @xmath73 ) tends to make the phase transition stronger , which is consistent with the results obtained in ref.@xcite .",

    "[ zu2 ] that the phase transition is the first order .",

    "however , the strength of the first order phase transition is at most @xmath96 for the former(latter ) option . on the other hand , as discussed in the text , there is no need to introduce bulk fields in the higher rank representation except for the adjoint one in our model .",

    "finally , in order to understand the phase structure of the theory of gauge - higgs unification more deeply , it is necessary to study the effect of chemical potential @xmath135 @xcite .",

    "since this potential is very complicated , we are particularly interested in the behavior of the effective potential in the limit of @xmath141 .",
