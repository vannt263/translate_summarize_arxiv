    "an accurate measurement of the three - point correlation function of galaxies has the potential to test the gravitational instability paradigm of structure formation and , on scales that are evolving in the weakly non - linear regime , to separate the effects of gravity from the contributions arising from galaxy bias ( fry & gaztaaga 1993 ; frieman & gaztaaga 1994 ) .",
    "the measurement of the three - point function and other higher order statistics from galaxy catalogues has a rich history ( peebles & groth 1975 ; groth & peebles 1977 ; fry & peebles 1978 ; baumgart & fry 1991 ; gaztaaga 1992 ; bouchet et  al .",
    "1993 ; fry & gaztaaga 1994 ) . in the past decade , three - point statistics have supported the basic premise of gravitational instability from gaussian initial conditions ( frieman & gaztaaga 1994 ; jing & brner 1998 ; frieman & gaztaaga 1999 ; hoyle , szapudi & baugh 2000 ; feldman et  al .",
    "the impact of these measurements on theoretical models has , however , not been as great as it could have been for two reasons .",
    "first , the traditional theoretical predictions rely upon the application of perturbation theory , which limits the comparison with data to relatively large scales on which the fluctuations are evolving in a linear or weakly non - linear fashion . second , previous generations of galaxy surveys simply covered too little volume to permit accurate measurements of the higher order correlation functions on the scales that could strongly constrain the simple theoretical models .",
    "recent theoretical and observational advancess have been such that we are now in a position to realize the full potential of higher order statistics .",
    "theoretical models of galaxy formation have progressed sufficiently to make predictions for the number of galaxies that reside in dark matter haloes of different mass ( benson et  al .",
    "2000 ; peacock & smith 2000 ; scoccimarro et  al .",
    "2001b ; berlind et  al .",
    "this allows the prediction to be extended to scales for which perturbation theory is not valid , and provides a framework for testing the physics of galaxy formation directly against clustering measurements .",
    "observationally , two recent surveys have revolutionized our view of the local universe : the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( hereafter 2dfgrs ; colless et  al .",
    "2001 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et  al .",
    "the ten - fold increase in survey size achieved by these projects means that precision measurements of higher order statistics are now be possible across a range of scales ( matarrese , verde & heavens 1997 ; colombi , szapudi & szalay 1998 ; szapudi , colombi & bernardeau 1999 ; scoccimarro , sefusatti & zaldarriaga 2004 ; sefusatti & scoccimarro 2005 ) .",
    "the higher order clustering measurements that are possible with these surveys have the potential to tighten the accepted values of basic cosmological parameters and to constrain the physics of galaxy formation that govern how galaxies are clustered .",
    "there have have been several analyses of the distribution of counts - in - cells using the final 2dfgrs catalogue .",
    "baugh  ( 2004 ) demonstrated that the higher order correlation functions display a hierarchical scaling , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the @xmath12-point , volume averaged correlation function ; this behaviour is expected if gravity plays a dominant role in shaping the distribution of galaxies .",
    "croton  ( 2004b ) found that the scaling of the hierarchical co - efficients show a weak ( if any ) dependence on galaxy luminosity . in the case of the three point volume averaged correlation function , both authors found that the skewness , @xmath13 .",
    "this value was found to be independent of cell size , though both baugh  and croton  noted that two large superstructures in the 2dfgrs volume broke this scale invariance in catalogues characterised by  galaxies .",
    "the result for the skewness of galaxies , @xmath14 , is at odds with the expectation for a  cosmology , in which @xmath15 .",
    "we note that conway  ( 2005 ) and wild  ( 2005 ) have also looked at the constraints that the distribution of counts - in - cells in the 2dfgrs provide on galaxy bias .",
    "all results from the 2dfgrs are in line with most previous measurements of the skewness and 3-point statistics , which are generally lower than the   predictions ( for a review , see  8 in bernardeau  2002 ) .",
    "this posses a puzzle , because the corresponding measurements for the variance and the 2-point function seem to follow the unbiased   predictions closely on large scales . in this paper , we present the first general results for the three - point correlation function measured from the final 2dfgrs catalogue .",

    "the expectation value is constructed by averaging over different spatial locations in the universe , which are assumed to form a fair sample ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "the two and three point correlation functions change rapidly in amplitude as a function of separation . in order to study the relationship between the correlation functions in more detail",
    ", it is useful to define the reduced three point function , @xmath2 , ( groth & peebles 1977 ) : @xmath25 here we have introduced a ` hierarchical ' form for the three point function , @xmath26 .",
    "this quantity is built up from the products of two - point functions generated from cyclic permutations of the pair separations which make up the sides of the triangle .",
    "when @xmath2 is constant the dependence of the three point correlation function on triangle shape and scale is fully accounted for by the corresponding changes in @xmath26 ; in this case @xmath2 is said to have no configuration dependence .",
    "previously , @xmath2 was thought to be approximately constant as a function of triangle size or shape ( ie see groth & peebles 1977 ) , a phenomenon that is usually referred to as hierarchical scaling @xcite .",
    "however , gs05 showed that with sufficiently accurate theoretical predictions or for carefully constructed measurements , @xmath2 is not in fact constant in _ any _ clustering regime . nevertheless , the variation in @xmath2 with scale is small when compared to the corresponding changes in @xmath27 or @xmath26 . on small scales ( @xmath28 ) , and for galaxies in redshift space ( i.e. as measured by galaxy redshift surveys ) , gs05 showed that @xmath29 displays a characteristic u - shape anisotropy moving from collapsed or elongated ( @xmath30 ) to more open ( @xmath31 ) triangles .",
    "this effect is driven by the velocity dispersion of galaxies inside virialized structures .",
    "gs05 demonstrated that this u - shape is universal , being only very weakly dependent on scale , the primordial spectral index , or the values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "gs05 further demonstrated that this feature should be detectable in current galaxy surveys , even if the measurements are affected by shot - noise or if galaxies are biased tracers of the mass . on larger scales ,",
    "the impact of velocity dispersion on the form of @xmath2 is reduced , with the consequence that the u - shape tends towards more of a v - shape and approaches the ( real space ) perturbation theory prediction ( see fig .  2 in gs05 ) .",
    "in order to interpret our measurements of @xmath2 for galaxies , we will compare them with theoretical predictions for dark matter in a @xmath3cdm universe .",
    "we first explain the form expected for the three point function of dark matter (  2.3.1 ) , before introducing a notation to quantify the differences found between galaxy and dark matter @xmath2 measurements (  2.3.2 ) .",
    "we shall denote the value of @xmath2 for the dark matter by @xmath32 .",
    "the theoretical predictions for @xmath33 are relatively insensitive to the precise values of the cosmological parameters , but have a strong dependence on the local spectral index , @xmath34 , of the linear perturbation theory power spectrum , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 ( eg . see fig .  9 and fig .",
    "10 in bernardeau et  al .",
    "this is also the case in redshift space ( see fig .  4 of gs05 ) , but where the dependence is however weaker .",
    "on the scales of interest to the present work , a change in the local spectral index of @xmath37 translates roughly to a change in the mean amplitude of @xmath33 by @xmath38 ( see juszkiewicz , bouchet & colombi 1993 ) . as an illustration ,",
    "the difference in the shape of the power spectrum between cdm models with density parameters of @xmath39 and @xmath40 is approximately @xmath41 on the scales of interest here , and so the change in @xmath33 between these models is small , @xmath42 ( in good agreement with fig .  4 of gs05 ) .",
    "the relative insensitivity of @xmath33 to changes in the cdm power spectrum is important as it strengthens any conclusions we reach about differences between the value of @xmath2 measured for galaxies and the predictions for the dark matter .",
    "the current levels of uncertainty on the matter density parameter , @xmath43 and the primordial spectral index @xmath44 are around the 10% level or better , and so the predicted value of @xmath33 is tightly constrained ( e.g. percival et  al .",

    "this is in good agreement with the results presented in table  [ tab : q3_wnl ] . on non - linear scales ,",
    "the difference between the data and the dark matter prediction is striking and will provide a powerful constraints on models of galaxy formation .",
    "note that the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : q3_scale ] are fully consistent with those discussed in  4.1.3 .",
    "the aim of the exercise of considering isoceles triangles is to isolate the dependence of @xmath2 on scale . to achieve this , the binning of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath17 is degraded and the range of values of @xmath17 considered on weakly non - linear scales is reduced when compared with the earlier , less restrictive analysis in  4.1.3 ( which considered also triangles with @xmath101 and better @xmath17 resolution ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting constraints on the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath50 presented in this subsection have larger errorbars .      the measured @xmath2 for the  sample , i.e. galaxies with absolute magnitudes in the range @xmath80@xmath81 , can be strongly influenced by the presence of two superstructures in the 2dfgrs , depending on the scale measured .",
    "the impact of these structures on the distribution of counts - in - cells in the  sample was first pointed out by baugh  ( 2004 ) .",
    "baugh  presented results both with and without the superstructures , to illustrate the systematic effect that their presence has upon the clustering measurements .",
    "for the  sample , the superstructures were found to dominate the clustering statistics on scales larger than @xmath102 , and we find that these structures have a comparable influence in our analysis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : q3_lstar ] ( in general the influence of these structures can be seen out to the largest scales that can be probed ) . on smaller scales ( @xmath103 ) , and for the other volume limited samples that we consider , either the systematic contribution from these large coherent structures lies within the ( correlated ) errorbars from the mocks , or , because of their spatial location , the superstructures are not present within the volume analysed .    the impact of the superstructures is equally pronounced in both the ngp and sgp regions , as is clear from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : q3_lstar ] .",
    "both the ngp and sgp results for @xmath29 ( solid and dashed lines respectively ) change in a similar way when the superstructure in each region is removed . as we pointed out in section  [ sec:2dfdata ] , the volume masked out when the superstructures are excised is less than @xmath82 of the total , with a loss of approximately @xmath83 of the galaxies . as baugh  remarked , the act of removing the superstructures is not intended serve as a correction to the clustering measurements , but rather as an illustration of the systematic effects that rare objects produce in higher order clustering statistics .",
    "that said , the results with the superclusters removed do appear to be more in line with our theoretical prejudice for the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "the difference between the results obtained for @xmath29 with and without the superstructures is larger than the variance over our ensemble of 22 mock catalogues .",
    "this indicates that the volume limited samples in the 22 mocks do not contain the large , coherent structures seen in the real data , as mentioned above . as baugh  ( 2004 ) commented , the presence of such structures could give us new insights into models of structure formation .",
    "however , it is important to bear in mind that the lack of superstructures in such a small number of mocks does not place a very high confidence limit against them being seen at all in the  model .",
    "all that we can conclude from the non - detection of such objects in our ensemble of synthetic 2dfgrs catalogues is that they occur less than 5% of the time .",
    "we have carried out an analysis of a large ensemble of dark matter simulations , in addition to undertaking a more extensive search of the hubble volume simulation , in order to place tighter constraints on the frequency of such superstructures in the  cosmology .",
    "before we can place firm limits on the chances of finding superstructures like those seen in the 2dfgrs , we need to make realistic mocks with the radial and angular selection of the 2dfgrs , but the preliminary indication from analyzing idealized , cubical volumes is that _ it is _ possible to find such superstructures in the simulations .",
    "full details will be presented in a future paper ( see also fosalba , pan & szapudi 2005 , who discuss the impact @xmath104 solar masses halos on theoretical prediction of @xmath2 ) .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : q3_lstar ] , we show , for the same triangle configuration as in the left panel , the results for @xmath29 split by colour : red ( solid ) and blue ( dashed ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that with the superstructures included , the difference between @xmath2 measured for red and blue galaxies is mildly significant ( with red galaxies having a systematically larger @xmath2 ) .",
    "in contrast , when the superclusters are excluded from the analysis , the measured @xmath2 for red and blue galaxies are identical to within the errors .",
    "this segregation suggests that the superstructures are , perhaps not unsurprisingly , populated preferentially by red galaxies .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , baugh et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) and croton et  al . (",

    "verde et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) found , using a three - point function analysis in fourier space , that 2dfgrs galaxies are essentially unbiased tracers of the mass , recovering a linear bias factor consistent with unity , @xmath116 , and a second order bias that is effectively zero , @xmath117 .",
    "we note that lahav et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) also reached a similar conclusion applying a different approach to the same 2dfgrs dataset , arguing that @xmath118 .",
    "there is good agreement between our best value for @xmath89 and that obtained by verde et  al , which is encouraging in view of the possible reasons for discrepancies between the results of the two studies set out below .",
    "however , our results for the quadratic bias are quite different from those of verde et  al .",
    "our optimum measurement gives a 3-@xmath4 detection of a non - zero value for the quadratic bias , whereas verde et  al .",
    "found a value consistent with zero .",
    "the discrepancy between our results and those of verde et  al",
    ". corresponds to @xmath119 for 2 degrees of freedom .",
    "this implies a 9-@xmath4 discrepancy ( recalling that the errorboxes are not square , but elongated ) .",
    "the discrepancy in the claimed values of @xmath120 is only 3 - 4 -@xmath4 if we take the nominal errors on the measurement of @xmath120 by verde et  al . and assume square errorboxes .",
    "what are the reasons behind this disagreement",
    "? we have identified some aspects in which our analysis differs from that of verde et  al . , which will contribute to the discrepancy at different levels , over and above the fact that we used different versions of the 2dfgrs data .",
    "first , we have considered the full 2dfgrs in configuration space , thus avoiding the need to compensate for the impact of the complicated 2dfgrs angular mask on measurements carried out in fourier space .",
    "verde et  al . do not correct for the convolution of the underlying bispectrum with the angular survey window function , arguing that , for the range of wavenumbers they consider , this effect is unimportant .",
    "this conclusion is based upon tests carried out for the _ power spectrum _ by percival et  al .",
    "the impact of the window function on the bispectrum could be more extensive than in the case of the power spectrum , introducing anisotropies into the recovered bispectrum , and has not been tested explicitly .",
    "second , the range of galaxy luminosities considered is different in the two studies .",
    "we have analysed volume limited samples drawn from the 2dfgrs , whereas verde et  al . used the flux limited survey ( however our best measurement comes from galaxies with luminosities between 1.3 and 2.5  , and their sample corresponds to @xmath121  ) .",
    "third , the scales used to constrain the parameters of the bias model are also different .",
    "we use triangles that probe pair separations from 9 to @xmath122 ; verde et  al . consider 13 to @xmath123 , although most of their signal comes from the smaller scales , as shown by their fig .  4 .",
    "fourth , verde et  al . neglect the covariance between measurements of the bispectrum at different wavenumbers , which is a poor approximation even in fourier space , as shown by scoccimarro et  al .",
    "( 2001a ) and feldman et al ( 2001 ) . neglecting the covariance",
    "will artificially suppress the errors on @xmath89 and @xmath124 by a considerable factor , corresponding roughly to the actual number of bins used divided by the number of dominant eigenmodes of the reduced three - point function , which in this case could be up to a factor of 4 .",
    "this could to some extent explain why our relative errors are larger than those quoted by verde et  al .",
    ", in spite of the more homogeneous 2dfgrs dataset used in our analysis .",
    "verde et  al use mock catalogues to estimate the errors on the recovered values of @xmath89 and @xmath124 .",
    "the true , underlying value of @xmath124 for the mocks is not known , so it is not possible to assess whether or not their method introduces any systematic biases in the recovered value of @xmath124 . a bias on @xmath124 introduced by the convolution with the angular mask and",
    "the covariance in the bispectrum measurements could affect the estimated values of both the mean and the errors .",
    "in fact , the mocks used by verde et al .",
    "are very similar to the ones used here as they were produced using the same prescription for galaxy biasing . as shown by the dashed lines in our figs .  2 ,  3 and 5",
    "there is a systematic shift of @xmath2 in the mocks with respect to the dark matter simulations , indicating that @xmath124 is in fact non zero ( and negative ) in the mocks , in contrast to fig.2 of verde et  al .",
    "our results are in somewhat better agreement with those of jing & brner ( 2004 ) and wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who analysed the 2dfgrs 100k release ( colless et  al . 2001 ) .",
    "they found that @xmath2 measured for the 2dfgrs is smaller than the @xmath3cdm predictions , particularly for galaxies brighter than .",
    "this agrees with our result ( compare the measurements for galaxies shown by symbols in the top rows of figs .  [",
    "fig : q3_210_wnl ] and  [ fig : q3_l_wnl ] with the dark matter predictions plotted using thick lines ) and is also at odds with the verde  result .",
    "our results for equilateral configurations in fig.[fig : q3_l_colour ] are also in good agreement with fig .  10 in wang et al .",
    "however , the comparison with these results is not straightforward for a number of reasons : ( i ) the authors used less than half the data that we have analysed .",
    "( ii ) they used a different parametrization and binning for their measurements of @xmath2 .",
    "( iii ) they neglected covariance between bins and used approximate bootstrap errors . jing & brner interpreted the lower values of @xmath2 that they found as a consequence of a larger linear bias , @xmath125 , in contrast to our conclusion that most of the bias comes from the quadratic term @xmath108 , with a linear bias consistent with unity .",
    "this difference has a dramatic consequence for the implied value of @xmath126 . for galaxies fainter than , jing & brner get unbiased results , which disagrees with our findings .",
    "this , however , could be a result of the smaller volume probed by jing & brner , which gives larger errors on their measurement .",
    "jing & brner also seem to find less configuration dependence for @xmath2 , i.e. as function of the triangle shape specified by @xmath17 . as pointed out in gs05 , this could partly be due to the use of too large a bin in the @xmath17 angle that parameterises triangular shape in addition to the smaller volume used .",
    "most recently , as this paper was about to be submitted , pan & szapudi ( 2005 ) presented new results on the monopole moment of the three - point function measured from the full 2dfgrs .",
    "they find @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "both the technique and assumptions employed by pan & szapudi are conceptually very different from ours .",
    "the monopole contribution to the normalized three point function merely yields a constant value that is independent of triangle opening angle .",
    "it is approximately equivalent to the first eigenmode in our singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix of @xmath2 , and therefore contains much less information than we use to place constraints on the bias parameters . as a consequence ,",
    "the monopole alone _ can not _ be used to separate @xmath89 from @xmath124 ; only the higher multipoles of @xmath2 can break this degeneracy . pan & szapudi instead use a simultaneous fit to the amplitudes of the two ( @xmath27 ) and three - point ( @xmath0 ) functions ( as a function of scale ) to place separate constraints on the values of @xmath89 and @xmath124 ; recall that our analysis only requires a fit to the ratio @xmath129 .",
    "both the modelling and the systematics involved in the fit used by pan & szapudi are therefore quite different from ours .",
    "our analysis is less sensitive to possible systematics in the amplitude of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we do not need to model the impact of redshift distortions on the amplitudes of the 2 and 3-point functions as pan & szapudi must .",
    "another important difference is the implicit assumption used by pan & szapudi that the biasing parameters , @xmath130 , are constant over the whole range of scales considered , i.e. from @xmath131 . in our case , we allow @xmath130 to change for each combination of fixed scales @xmath132 and @xmath133 . given these differences , there is surprisingly good agreement in the values obtained for @xmath89 by the two methods .",
    "however , their @xmath124 value is significantly different .",
    "this is not unexpected given the systematic uncertainties in modelling redshift distortions through the @xmath134 term in eqn .",
    "[ 6 ] of their paper . as shown in the right - hand panel of our fig .",
    "[ fig : q3_scale ] and in table  [ tab : q3_wnl ] , we find a weak trend for the bias parameters to increase as the triangle scale is reduced .",
    "this could also help to explain the slightly larger biasing parameters they find .",
    "perhaps more puzzling is their fig .  7 , which shows how @xmath89 increases for the brightest galaxies , in contrast to our fig .  7 ( which only applies to the smallest scales considered by pan & szapudi ) .",
    "our findings are compatible with the values of the projected @xmath2 measured in the apm survey , which is the parent catalogue of the 2dfgrs .",
    "frieman & gaztaaga ( 1999 ) also found values of @xmath2 that lay below the @xmath3cdm predictions .",
    "however , they did not perform a proper s / n analysis with the covariance matrix to separate @xmath89 from @xmath124 .",
    "measured in fourier space from the iras point source redshift catalogue ( pscz , saunders et  al .",
    "2000 ) by scoccimarro  ( 2001a ) and feldman  ( 2001 ) . ]",
    "our results are also in qualitative agreement with the values of the angular skewness , @xmath135 , measured in the apm galaxy survey ( gaztaaga 1994 ) .",
    "the mean over large angular scales ( corresponding to @xmath136 ) was estimated to be @xmath137 , with an error ( dominated by sampling covariance ) of the order @xmath138 .",
    "the theoretical predictions for the projected moments using perturbation theory ( bernardeau 1995 ) and dark matter simulations ( gaztaaga & bernardeau 1998 ) yield a mean value @xmath139 over the same scales .. this was first noted by bernardeau ( 1995 ) and later confirmed with simulations by gaztaaga & bernardeau ( 1998 ) .",
    "see also comments relating to figs .",
    "47 and 54 in bernardeau et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) for further details . ]",
    "the skewness measured from the apm survey is thus also below the the  prediction .",
    "this agrees well with our estimates of the bias parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which give @xmath140 , in excellent agreement with the observed apm values .",
    "note that the apm results correspond to configuration space , in contrast to our results which are in redshift space .",
    "thus , our simple quadratic bias model ( in redshift space ) can account simultaneously for observations of real - space ( projected ) and redshift - space results for 3-point statistics ( both skewness and 3-point function ) .",
    "our new result solves the long standing observational puzzle regarding how the measured and predicted values of @xmath65 and @xmath2 can be reconciled .",
    "we have measured the reduced 3-point function @xmath141 ( as defined in eq .  [ fiftheq ] ) in the final 2dfgrs catalogue , using triangles of different scales and opening angles .",
    "we have utilized a range of volume limited samples in our analysis , which allows us to look for clustering trends as a function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath142-band photometry in the final 2dfgrs data release also allows us to look for a dependence of the three point function on galaxy colour .",
    "another novel aspect of our analysis is that we employ an eigenmode decomposition to deal with correlations between data - points and to assess the signal - to - noise of our measurements ; our results typically have a signal - to - noise @xmath143 .",
    "there are two primary motivations for measuring the reduced three point function .",
    "the first is to test the gravitational instability paradigm for the formation of large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "there are clear predictions for the form of the three - point function in the case of an initially gaussian distribution of density fluctuations that have evolved under gravity ( see bernardeau et  al .",
    "the second motivation is to provide new constraints on models of galaxy formation , by establishing how the three - point function of galaxies differs from that of the underlying dark matter .",
    "it turns out that the predictions for the dark matter are insensitive to the amplitude of density fluctuations and to the detailed shape of the power spectrum .",
    "we have divided our analysis into two clustering regimes : weakly non - linear clustering ( i.e. @xmath144mpc or @xmath145 ) and non - linear clustering ( @xmath146mpc or @xmath147 ) . on weakly non - linear scales , there is a striking similarity between the _ shape _ of @xmath2 measured for galaxies and the predictions for the dark matter .",
    "this supports the idea that the basic phenomenon behind the clustering pattern of galaxies is gravitational instability , which confirms our previous conclusions reached from the analysis of the distribution of counts - in - cells for the 2dfgrs ( baugh et  al .",
    "2004 ; croton et  al .",
    "2004b ) .",
    "there are , however , significant differences , between @xmath2 measured for galaxies and the expectations for a  universe .",
    "we have modelled this discrepancy in terms of a shift and a scaling applied to the dark matter predictions . for scales on which the fluctuations are weakly nonlinear",
    ", the scaling can be identified with the linear bias , @xmath89 and the offset with the quadratic bias , @xmath148 .",
    "our best measurement of these bias parameters gives a linear bias consistent with unity , but a significant detection of a non - zero quadratic bias , @xmath149 .",
    "this is the first time that the signature of a quadratic bias has been seen so convincingly ; our measurements are 9-@xmath4 away from the case in which galaxies faithfully trace the mass ( @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) .",
    "our results disagree with some of the previous analyses of the three point function in the 2dfgrs ; a detailed discussion of the possible reasons for this is given in section 5 .",
    "we note that feldman et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) also found a negative quadratic bias term when analysing the three point function of galaxies in the iras point source catalogue redshift survey , albeit at a less significant level than our detection .",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath2 for galaxies and the dark matter increases as the scale of the triangles is reduced ( while remaining in the weakly non - linear regime ) , which translates into a slight increase in the best - fitting values of the bias parameters ( see table  [ tab : q3_wnl ] ) .",
    "we find no significance evidence for luminosity segregation on these weakly non - linear scales .    on smaller scales we are able to detect a significant dependence of @xmath2 on scale , color and luminosity .",
    "these trends appear at first sight to be at odds with the preliminary results obtained by kayo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) using the sdss , although the errors on the measurements presented by these authors are much larger than ours . in all cases ,",
    "the measurements for the various samples of galaxies are clearly below the predictions for the dark matter .",
    "our detailed measurements , presented in fig.6 - 8 and table 3 , should provide important new constraints on models of galaxy formation ( see scoccimarro  2001b ; wang et al . 2004 ) .",
    "our strong detection of a quadratic bias offers a new explanation of the long standing puzzle of why redshift surveys have tended to measure a different skewness ( @xmath152 ; see croton et  al .",
    "2004b for the 2dfgrs and table 19 of bernardeau et  al .",
    "2002 for a summary of other observational results ) from that predicted for the  cosmology ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "if we take the non - linear bias relation derived by fry & gaztaaga ( 1993 ) , @xmath154 and insert our best - fitting values for the bias parameters ( @xmath155 and @xmath156 ) , then we obtain @xmath157 , just as required by the observations .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is independent of the overall amplitude of fluctuations .",
    "this means that our measurement of the linear bias , @xmath89 , is fully independent of the normalization of the fluctuations in the dark matter , as specified by @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , the predictions for @xmath2 for dark matter are relatively insensitive to the shape of the power spectrum , making this estimate of the bias robust to minor changes in the parameters of the  model . we can therefore combine our estimate of @xmath89 with the amplitude of fluctuations measured from the galaxy distribution , @xmath158 , to derive an estimate of the amplitude of fluctuations in the dark matter , @xmath64 .",

    "both factors depend on the cosmological density parameters for matter and vacuum energy , which we have set to their concordance model values ( @xmath166 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",

    "<S> we present new results for the 3-point correlation function , @xmath0 , measured as a function of scale , luminosity and colour from the final version of the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced three point correlation function , @xmath1 , is estimated for different triangle shapes and sizes , employing a full covariance analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the form of @xmath2 is consistent with the expectations for the @xmath3-cold dark matter model , confirming that the primary influence shaping the distribution of galaxies is gravitational instability acting on gaussian primordial fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find a clear offset in amplitude between @xmath2 for galaxies and the predictions for the dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to rule out the scenario in which galaxies are unbiased tracers of the mass at the 9-@xmath4 level . on weakly non - linear scales , </S>",
    "<S> we can interpret our results in terms of galaxy bias parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find a linear bias term that is consistent with unity , @xmath5 and a quadratic bias @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first significant detection of a non - zero quadratic bias , indicating a small but important non - gravitational contribution to the three point function . </S>",
    "<S> our estimate of the linear bias from the three point function is independent of the normalisation of underlying density fluctuations , so we can combine this with the measurement of the power spectrum of 2dfgrs galaxies to constrain the amplitude of matter fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the _ rms _ linear theory variance in spheres of radius @xmath7mpc is @xmath8 , providing an independent confirmation of values derived from other techniques . on non - linear scales , where @xmath9 , we find that @xmath2 has a strong dependence on scale , colour and luminosity .    </S>",
