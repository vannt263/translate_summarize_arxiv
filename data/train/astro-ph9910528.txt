    "clusters of galaxies are playing an important role in the study of large scale structures of the universe .",
    "in particular , the observed dynamical properties of clusters set stringent constrains on models of structure formation as well as on cosmological parameters .",
    "the popular inflation plus the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies are found to be able to match the existing observations of clusters if the cosmological parameters such as the mass density @xmath0 , the cosmological constant @xmath1 and the mass fluctuation amplitude are properly selected ( e.g. bahcall & cen 1992 ; jing et al . 1993 , 1995 ; jing & fang 1994 ; eke et al . 1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; carlberg et al .",
    "1997 ; bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ; xu , fang & wu 1998 ; xu , fang & deng 1999 ) .    yet",
    ", some fundamental properties of clusters are not directly measurable , among which the conventional determination of gravitating masses of clusters is related to the dynamical state of the clusters , i.e. the virialization of both baryonic and nonbaryonic matter .",
    "for instance , the so - called dynamical mass estimator relies on the hypothesis that the optical galaxies and/or the hot intracluster gas are the tracers of the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "nevertheless , the virialization assumption is often challenged by the existence of substructures ( e.g. richstone , loeb & turner 1992 ; jing et al .",
    "1995 ; crone , evrard & richstone 1996 ; patrick 1999 ; mathiesen , evrard & mohr 1999 ) .",
    "substructures in both optical and x - ray maps of clusters suggest that clusters may still be in the process of formation ( e.g. stein 1997 ; kriessler & beers 1997 ; solanes et al .",
    "spatially - resolved measurements of gas temperature in some clusters illustrate the complex two - dimensional patterns including the asymmetric variation and the significant decline with radius ( henry & briel 1995 ; henriksen & white 1996 ; henriksen & markevitch 1996 ; markevitch 1996 ) , indicative of strong substructure merging . the unidentified or neglected substructures in clusters may lead to an overestimate of galaxy velocity dispersion , and therefore the virial mass ( smail et al .",
    "this implies that the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis may be inappropriate to the dynamical state of optical galaxies and intracluster gas for some clusters .    on the other hand , a statistical comparison of the cluster masses determined from optical galaxies , x - ray observations and",
    "gravitational lensing shows that there is an excellent agreement among different mass estimates on scales much greater than the core radii .",
    "the discrepancy of these mass estimators appears only inside the central regions of clusters where the local dynamical activities of galaxies and cooling flows may become dominant ( wu & fang 1997 ; allen 1998 ; wu et al . 1998 ) .",
    "since gravitational lensing reveals the cluster gravitating mass regardless of the matter compositions and their dynamical status , the consistency between these three mass estimators indicates that clusters may be regarded as dynamically - relaxed systems as a whole .",
    "further support to this argument comes from the study of the correlations between the optically determined velocity dispersion of cluster galaxies , the x - ray measured luminosity and the temperature .",
    "namely , although many x - ray clusters show irregular configurations and are substructured , there are tight correlations between the velocity dispersion of optical galaxies , the temperature and the luminosity of the intracluster gas ( evrard , metzler , & navarro 1996 ; mohr , & evrard 1997 ; wu , fang & xu 1998 ; wu , xue & fang 1999 ; mohr , mathiesen , & evrard 1999 ) .    in a word ,",
    "the observational evidences for whether galaxy clusters are virialized seem to be contradictory . in this paper",
    ", we intend to highlight this contradiction .",
    "we shall show that beyond the scale of full virialization there exists a radius range in which clusters are quasi - virialized , i.e. the internal structure of _ individual _ cluster exhibits a substantial departure from dynamical relaxation , while many _ statistical _ properties of clusters are approximately the same as those of the virialized system . for instance , the virial relation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the velocity dispersion and @xmath4 is the mass of a system within a given radius , is a good approximation on scales larger than virial radius , even though many clusters are irregular in shape and show substructures on these scales .",
    "actually , such a `` duality '' is an indicator of the transition from pre - virialization to virialization .",
    "this transition can roughly be described by three stages : a ) full virialization , in which both the individual objects and their statistical properties are virialized ; b ) quasi - virialization , in which the ensemble statistical features are similar to those of the virialized systems , but the scattering from the averages is still significant ; c ) pre - virialization , in which both individual objects and their ensemble statistical features are significantly different from virialization .    in hierarchical clustering scenario ,",
    "the larger the scale , the less the virialization .",
    "thus , the dynamical evolution from phase a ) to b ) or from phase b ) to c ) can be revealed by studying the dynamical properties of the objects on the scale of clusters and beyond .",
    "in particular , one can address the question : on what scale will the transition of phase a ) to b ) or phase b ) to c ) occur ?",
    "we are interested in this issue also because the virialization evolution is model - dependent .",
    "it is hoped that the scale - dependence of virialization is useful for discrimination of various cosmological models .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we will describe our samples of cluster halos which are multi - scale identified from n - body simulations under three different cosmological models : 1 ) the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) , 2 ) low density , flat cdm model with a non - zero @xmath5 ( lcdm ) , and 3 ) the open cdm ( ocdm ) model . the press - schechter ( ps ) formalism is also introduced so that the simulation results can be confirmed by a semi - analytical approach .",
    "we then investigate in  3 various statistical indicators of virialization , including density contrast , configuration , substructure and velocity dispersion .",
    "the emphasis is to find the scale - dependence of these features , and determine the scale range of virialization and quasi - virialization . in ",
    "4 we will discuss the applicable range of the virial mass estimator as a statistical measure for quasi - virialized systems . in ",
    "5 the temperature function of clusters will be constructed and used for model discrimination .",
    "finally , we will briefly summarize our conclusions in  6 .",
    "the samples to be used for analyzing the scale - dependence of virialization are produced by n - body simulations with the p@xmath7 m code developed by y.p.jing ( jing & fang 1994 ; jing et al .",
    "we employed the following cosmological models : 1 ) scdm , 2 ) lcdm , and 3 ) ocdm . the cosmological parameters ( @xmath8 ) are taken to be ( 1.0,0.0,0.5,0.62 ) , ( 0.3,0.7,0.75,1.0 ) , and ( 0.3,0.0,0.75,1.0 ) for the scdm , lcdm and ocdm , respectively .",
    "these parameters provide a consistent description for many observational properties of the universe , especially the abundance of clusters ( e.g. jing & fang 1994 ; bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ) .",
    "other parameters in our simulations , i.e. box size @xmath9 , number of particles @xmath10 and the effective force resolution @xmath11 , are chosen to be ( @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath12 mpc , @xmath13 mpc ) .",
    "we have run 8 realizations for each model .",
    "a particle has mass of @xmath14 m@xmath15 , which is small enough to resolve reliably the rich clusters of @xmath16 m@xmath15 .",
    "we have also performed simulations with a cobe normalization @xmath17 for scdm .",
    "three realizations were made .",
    "there are two ways of studying the scale - dependence of dynamical status of clusters .",
    "one is to identify clusters with a given size , like abell radius @xmath18 @xmath19 mpc , and then study the dependence of dynamical properties of these clusters on scales less or greater than @xmath20 .",
    "another is to identify clusters by multi - scale resolution analysis , and produce samples of @xmath6-clusters , i.e. clusters identified with scales @xmath6 , and then , study the @xmath6-dependencies , and also the radius - dependence of @xmath6-clusters .",
    "if all objects on all scales @xmath6 are virialized , @xmath6-clusters should show  clouds in clouds \" morphology , i.e. all smaller @xmath6 clusters locate in the centers of larger @xmath6 clusters . in this case",
    ", the multi - scale identification will actually produce the same samples as the abell radius identification .",
    "the @xmath20-identification and the multi - scale identification would be essentially equivalent .",
    "however , in the evolutionary stage of pre - virialization , the two identifications are different from each other .",
    "the multi - scale identification is more effective to study problems of scale - dependence of clusters and beyond ( xu , fang & wu 1998 ; xu , fang & deng 1999 ; fang & xu 1999 ) .",
    "the detailed procedure of the multi - scale identifications based on the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) has been presented in the papers of xu , fang & wu ( 1998 ) and xu , fang & deng ( 1999 ) .",
    "the technique of applying the dwt for large scale structure study is reviewed in fang & thews ( 1998 ) .",
    "briefly , we first describe the distribution of the particles by a 3-d matrix , and then do the fast 3-d _ daubechies 4 _ dwt and the reversed transformations to find the wavelet function coefficients ( wfcs ) and scaling function coefficients ( sfcs ) on various scales . for each scale ,",
    "the cells with sfcs larger than those of the random sample by a given statistical significance , say 3@xmath21 , are picked up as the halos of cluster candidates . around each of the candidates , we place a @xmath22 grid with the size of cluster diameter and",
    "search for the accurate center .",
    "the cluster center is taken as the position where the largest mass is surrounded .",
    "the mass @xmath4 of a cluster is measured by counting the particles within a sphere of radius @xmath6 .",
    "it is enough to take @xmath6 to be numbers of bi - fold , i.e. 0.75 , 1.5 , 3 , 6 , 12 and 24 @xmath19mpc .",
    "since the @xmath6 sphere does not depend on the shape of the wavelet functions , this identification is independent of the selection of wavelet function .    with the identified @xmath6-clusters , one can find the mass function ( mf ) or abundance @xmath23 , which is the number density of @xmath6-clusters with mass larger than @xmath4 . as an example the mfs of @xmath6-clusters of the scdm model",
    "are ploted in fig .",
    "1 . it shows scaling behavior . for other models",
    "the mfs show similar behaviors ( fang & xu 1999 ) .",
    "the abundance @xmath24 of clusters on the abell radius given by the dwt identification is found to be the same as those given by usual friends - of - friends ( fof ) identification ( xu , fang & wu 1998 ; xu , fang & deng 1999 ) .    since each halo or cluster",
    "is characterized by two parameters @xmath4 and @xmath6 , it is inconvenient to define richness by its mass alone . instead , the richness can be defined by the abundance , @xmath23 , or by the mean separation of neighbor clusters @xmath25 the richness of @xmath26-clusters with masses @xmath27 is equal to the richness of @xmath28- clusters with masses @xmath29 if their @xmath30 s are the same .",
    "for instance , for the top 25 clusters on various scale @xmath6 in the simulation box 310@xmath7 @xmath31 mpc@xmath32 , their richness is @xmath33 @xmath19 mpc . for a given @xmath6",
    ", this richness definition has its usual meaning , i.e. the larger the @xmath4 , the less the @xmath23 and the higher the richness .",
    "the mfs given by the n - body simulation can be explained by the hierarchical clustering of cosmic structures . in the models of hierarchical clustering with gaussian initial perturbations ,",
    "the comoving number density of collapsed halos at @xmath34 in the mass range @xmath4 to @xmath35 is given by ( press & schechter 1974 ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 almost independent of cosmologies .",
    "@xmath38 is the linear theory @xmath39 mass density fluctuation in spheres of mass @xmath4 at redshift @xmath34 within a top - hat window of radius @xmath40 , and is determined by the initial density spectrum @xmath41 and normalization factor @xmath42mpc,0 ) .    from eq.(2 ) , the cumulative number density of the collapsed halos with mass greater than @xmath4 is given by @xmath43 equations ( 2),(3 ) have been found to be good descriptions of the mass functions of collapsed clusters identified by fof method from n - body simulation ( e.g. mo , jing & white 1997 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that ps predications fit very well with the mass function ( mf ) of clusters on the abell radius given by the dwt identification .    as pointed out by mo & white ( 1995 ) and bi & fang ( 1996 ; 1997 ) ,",
    "the ps formalism can be employed to approximately describe not only collapsed halos , but also uncollapsed regions , i.e. both collapsed halos and uncollapsed regions can be viewed as the sum of various individual top - hat spheres .",
    "an uncollapsed region ( or  quasi - virialized halo \" in terminology of this paper ) corresponds to a region in which the initial linear fluctuation is less than the threshold 1.686 at the redshift considered . as a consequence",
    ", one can consider the initial density field as a system consisting of many spheres , each of which has initial radius @xmath40 and density contrasts @xmath44 , and mass is equal to @xmath45 .",
    "let s consider an arbitrary spherical volume of radius @xmath6 at redshift @xmath34 .",
    "matter in this volume can come from various initial spheres with @xmath40 and @xmath44 .",
    "for a given @xmath6 , one can find the relationship between @xmath40 and @xmath44 by considering the nonlinear evolution of a massive shell under spherical symmetry ( padmanabhan 1993 ; mo & white 1995 ; bi & fang 1996 )",
    ". then , we have the relation @xmath46 it means that a spherical region of @xmath47 and @xmath40 will evolve into @xmath6 at @xmath34 , which includes both collapsed and uncollapsed objects . the function @xmath48 is given in bi & fang ( 1996 ) .",
    "if we identify clusters with radius @xmath6 in an arbitrary spatial domain @xmath49 , the fraction of the total mass @xmath50 contained in clusters of mass @xmath51 corresponds to the fraction of mass which have initial fluctuations larger than a given @xmath52 .",
    "for a gaussian field , this fraction is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the variance of density perturbation on scale @xmath40 . because a spherical region of @xmath47 and @xmath40 will evolve into @xmath6 at @xmath34 , initial spherical regions of @xmath55 and @xmath40",
    "will evolve into radii less than @xmath6 at @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the comoving number density of the collapsed and uncollapsed ps spheres with mass in @xmath56 , which are spheres identified with radius @xmath6 at @xmath34 , is given by @xmath57 dm \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   &   = & -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi } } \\frac{\\rho_0}{m^2 } \\nu e^{-\\frac{\\nu^2}{2}}(\\frac{d ln\\sigma}{d lnm } -\\frac{d ln\\delta}{d lnm } ) , % \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 denotes the relative height of the initial perturbation ( evaluated at redshift @xmath34 ) .",
    "the number 2 in the equation is the notorious @xmath59 multiplication factor of ps formalism ( see discussion in bond et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the cumulative number density , @xmath23 , of collapsed and uncollapsed @xmath6-halos with mass greater than @xmath4 should be @xmath60 these mfs are also plotted in fig .",
    "it shows that the ps formalism basically explains the mass functions given by n - body simulation , especially the scaling behaviors .",
    "meanwhile , fig .",
    "1 shows that the ps calculations systematically underpredict the mfs on scale @xmath61 h@xmath62 mpc .",
    "this is most likely caused by the hypothesis of spherical symmetry of the dynamic evolution of uncollapsed regions .",
    "a similar discrepancy has also been found in the two - point correlation of halos in underdense ( or uncollapsed ) regions , i.e. the ps formalism significantly underpredicts the halo - halo correlation when small halos are in low - density environments ( jing 1998 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the ps result shows the scale - dependence of statistical features given by the ps formalism is the same as that of n - body simulation .",
    "this agreement is very useful to reveal the status of quasi - virialized ( or uncollapsed ) regions .",
    "a popular indicator of virialization of clusters is the density contrast . for spherical collapse in a standard flat universe , the virial radius is usually measured as the radius within which the mean density contrast is @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 . for open universe , the density contrast within virial radius is in the range of @xmath65 to @xmath66 ( lacey & cole 1993 ) . for models of scdm , lcdm and ocdm , the density contrasts @xmath67",
    "are equal to 178 , 335 , 402 , respectively .",
    "observationally , the spatial range of virialization is characterized by @xmath68 , the radius where the average interior number density of galaxies is @xmath69 times higher than the average .",
    "thus , the deviation from virialization of a @xmath6-cluster can be quantified by the mean mass contrast , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the mean mass within radius @xmath6 , and @xmath72 the mean mass excess of the @xmath6-clusters .",
    "2 plots the mass contrasts of @xmath6-clusters with richness @xmath73 30 , 50 and 100 @xmath19 mpc for the scdm , lcdm and ocdm models , respectively .",
    "the lines in lcdm almost overlap with those for ocdm . as expected , the more massive ( i.e. the larger @xmath30 ) the clusters , the closer to virialization . for the scdm clusters with richness @xmath73 30 , 50 , and 100 @xmath19 mpc , the virialized radii @xmath74 at @xmath34 are 1.09 , 1.33 , and 1.60 @xmath19 mpc , respectively .",
    "they are 1.03 , 1.33 , 1.82 @xmath19 mpc for lcdm , and 0.96 , 1.27 , 1.70 @xmath19 mpc for ocdm .",
    "therefore , except for the richest clusters , the full virialization generally is realized only on scales less than @xmath18 @xmath19 mpc .",
    "this is consistent with the observed result that @xmath68 is usually smaller than the abell radius @xmath20 .",
    "namely , except for the core regions of clusters , abell clusters as a whole are not yet fully virialized .    in the case of positive bias ,",
    "@xmath68 given by galaxies is larger than that of dark matter , and therefore , the real virialized range will be even smaller than that given by galaxy observations . as a result , in the scale range of equal to and larger than the abell radius , halos for @xmath6-clusters are mostly in the stages of quasi- or even pre - virialization .",
    "the spatial configuration of clusters is also a useful indicator of virialization .",
    "as discussed above , if the halos of clusters are fully virialized , their spatial configurations have to be regular  clouds in clouds \" , i.e. the smaller @xmath6-clusters are located in the centers of larger @xmath6-clusters .",
    "3 plots a projected distribution of @xmath6-clusters identified from one realization of model ocdm within box 310 @xmath31 mpc@xmath7 , which illustrates the top 25 massive clusters for each @xmath6 ( the richness is @xmath75 @xmath19 mpc ) .",
    "the scales @xmath6 are taken to be @xmath76 and 24 @xmath19mpc , respectively .",
    "3 shows a variety of configurations of the halos .",
    "apparently , some halos show  clouds in clouds \" morphology , while some do not .",
    "according to the scale of @xmath68 in fig .",
    "2 , it is expected that , for such a high richness , clusters of @xmath77 2 @xmath19 mpc have to be symmetrical and concentric  clouds in clouds \" structures .",
    "3 , indeed , shows that 21 of the 25 @xmath78 and 1.5 @xmath19 mpc are concentric .",
    "these @xmath79 0.75 - 1.5  clouds in clouds \" objects are fully virialized",
    ".    on the other hand , there are seven @xmath6 = 3 @xmath19 mpc clusters which do not contain either @xmath78 @xmath19 mpc or 1.5 @xmath19 mpc clusters in their centers .",
    "these are massive clusters on scale 3 @xmath19 mpc , but without fully virialized cores . on scales",
    "@xmath80 @xmath19 mpc , more @xmath6-clusters are asymmetric , irregular , and without small - scale high density peaks within them .",
    "these features show that identifying structures with a given scale like @xmath20 may miss massive objects which do not contain high density peaks on scale @xmath20 . only in the range @xmath81",
    ", the multi - scale identifications find the same sample as the single - scale identification .    in terms of mass and length scale ,",
    "@xmath82 @xmath19 mpc clusters actually are superclusters .",
    "observationally , supercluster is defined as cluster of rich clusters ( top @xmath20-clusters ) . in fig .",
    "3 , one can see that some @xmath20-clusters are located together to form larger scale clumps or filaments .",
    "they are obviously superclusters .",
    "fig.3 shows , however , that some of the top 25 @xmath82 @xmath19 mpc halos contain nothing of @xmath77 24 @xmath19 mpc massive halos .",
    "this is , although the mass and length scale of these objects are the same as superclusters , they do not contain any of the top 25 clusters on smaller scales .",
    "this result indicates that the identification by `` cluster of rich clusters '' probably is incomplete .",
    "recently , it has been found that the dynamical properties of superclusters are not only determined by rich clusters , but also by numerous galaxies in the intra - cluster regions ( small et al .",
    "1998 ) . therefore , to study the dynamics on scales beyond clusters , one should directly identify structures from matter or galaxy distributions , instead of using only rich clusters .",
    "similar to the configuration , the number of substructures in a cluster is also an effective measure of the deviation from virialization .",
    "the asymmetry of the configuration of clusters actually is caused by their substructures .",
    "considering that the time scale required for a sound wave in the intracluster gas to cross a cluster is shorter than the dynamical time of the cluster , it is reasonable to assume that the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with local gravitational potential , and therefore , x - ray images map the cluster potential locally ( jing et al .",
    "thus , one can identify substructure as potential minimum of clusters .",
    "we search for the potential minimums by the same algorithm of jing et al .",
    "briefly , we first place a mesh with 0.24 @xmath19mpc resolution around each center of identified @xmath6-cluster halos . the size of this mesh",
    "is taken to be 7.5 , 7.5 , 7.5 , 15 and 30 @xmath19mpc for clusters of @xmath79 0.75 , 1.5 , 3 , 6 and 12 @xmath19mpc , corresponding to grid points @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "we accumulate mass density values for the meshes from particles .",
    "the mass of each particle is smoothed by a gaussian kernel @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the smoothing length .",
    "the smoothing length @xmath87 of particle @xmath88 is equal to the local mean separation @xmath89 , calculated by counting five nearest particles around @xmath88 .",
    "then the density value on arbitrary cell @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the separation between cell @xmath90 and particle @xmath88 of mass @xmath93 .",
    "the summation in eq.(9 ) is made over all particles within radius 3.75 h@xmath62 mpc . with this mass distribution , gravitational potential on the grid",
    "can be obtained .",
    "we then identify a cell to be a potential minimum if its potential value is smaller than those of its all 26 neighbors .",
    "obviously , if a @xmath6-cluster contains only one potential minimum , it means no substructure .",
    "4 shows the dependence of average number of substructures per @xmath6-cluster on the count of the particles within the cluster , which is proportional to the cluster mass .",
    "as expected , the larger @xmath6 clusters contain more substructures on average because larger scale objects are less virialized .    a `` surprising '' result shown in fig .",
    "4 is that for @xmath94 mpc clusters , the more massive the clusters ( i.e. the more the count of particles ) , the more the substructures .",
    "this seems to be contradicting with the general conclusion of last section : the more massive the cluster , the closer to virialization . actually , this is due to the threshold used for identifying substructures . in massive objects substructures with deep potential valleys",
    "are easy to grow up , but not so for less massive objects . for clusters with @xmath95mpc , containing no substructures on average ( as shown in fig .",
    "4 ) does nt mean that all @xmath96 1.5 @xmath19mpc clusters are fully virialized .",
    "contrarily , low richness @xmath96 1.5 @xmath19mpc clusters are pre - virialized ( fig .",
    "they simply do not have enough mass to form substructures above the defined threshold .",
    "similar phenomena can be seen from fig .",

    "5 it is seen that the scdm clusters generally are less substructured than those of the lcdm and ocdm . it does nt mean that the scdm clusters are more close to virialization . instead , the deep potential valleys for substructures in the scdm @xmath97mpc clusters formed later than the lcdm and ocdm .    fig .",
    "6 gives the @xmath6-dependence of the mean number of substructures per @xmath6-clusters having richness @xmath73 80  h@xmath62 mpc .",
    "for all the three cosmological models , the number of substructures per @xmath6-clusters increases with @xmath6 . as fig . 5",
    ", the mean number of substructures in model scdm is less than those of lcdm and ocdm .",
    "the substructure number at redshift @xmath99 is less than that of @xmath34 , too .",
    "this is once again to indicate that deep potential valleys have not yet developed at @xmath99 .",
    "thus , despite substructure is an indicator of the deviation from virialization , there is no simple relation between virialization and substructures .",
    "a system with rich substructures definitely deviates from virialization , but the existence of substructures is not a necessary condition of the deviation from virialization .",
    "systems with more deep potential valleys are not always in a lower degree of virialization than those with fewer potential valleys .",
    "this point is important in studying objects on scales larger than @xmath20 .",
    "the most decisive measure of virialization certainly is the velocity dispersion of a cluster . for a virialized @xmath6-cluster we have @xmath100 , in which @xmath101 denotes the mass of a cluster within radius @xmath6 .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath3 of @xmath6-cluster is calculated from the velocities of all cdm particles within radius @xmath6 with respect to the center of the cluster .",

    "should be completely determined by its masses @xmath101 .",
    "7 shows that @xmath3 is almost completely determined by @xmath6 and @xmath101 if clusters are as massive as @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively for @xmath96 0.75 , 1.5 and 3 @xmath19 mpc .",
    "namely , in these parameter ranges ( @xmath6 , @xmath4 ) , clusters are fully virialized . out of it ,",
    "velocity dispersion @xmath3 is no longer completely determined by radius @xmath6 and mass @xmath101 . as shown in fig .",

    "this result provides an explanation for the fact that the cluster virial masses determined from optical galaxies statistically are in a good agreement with gravitational lensing - derived masses on scales much greater than the core radii .",

    "similar to eq.(11 ) , the mass @xmath178 estimated from hydrodynamical equilibrium model of x - ray gas is found to be , _ on average _ , in agreement with the gravitational lensing - derived cluster masses @xmath179 . the correlation between @xmath180 and @xmath175 in the scale range of @xmath181 @xmath19 mpc is ( wu & fang 1997 ; wu et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath182 this result also shows the feature of quasi - virialization : the hydrodynamical equilibrium model - derived @xmath178 is reliable , while individual clusters may deviate from virialization .",

    "eq.(13 ) means that the temperature @xmath186 of x - ray emitting intracluster gas statistically can be used as a virial indicator of the underlying gravitational potentials of clusters , and is related to the velocity dispersion by virial relation as @xmath187 the current observations have revealed a constant temperature profile within virial radius ( irwin , bergman & evrard 1999 ) . since the profile of @xmath106 is flat within radius @xmath188 6 @xmath19 mpc ( fig .",
    "10 ) , eq.(14 ) indicates that the averaged temperature of clusters is also approximately constant within the range of quasi - virialization .",
    "for the virialized and quasi - virialized clusters , we can define the temperature function ( tf ) of clusters , @xmath189 , which is the number density of @xmath6-clusters with temperature larger than @xmath186 . with eq.(14 )",

    "actually , eq.(14 ) has been widely employed in the calculation of tf from vdf ( e.g. klypin & rhee , g. 1994 ; jing & fang 1994 ) . yet , as we have emphasized , we are interested in the effect of dynamical state on the tfs .    fig . 13 plots the differential tfs , @xmath191 , for @xmath96 0.75 to 12 @xmath19mpc clusters in the three dark matter models .",
    "in fact , the vdf - tf transfer [ eq.(14 ) ] may not be correct for clusters of @xmath96 12 @xmath19 mpc , which is plotted only for comparison .",
    "if the system is fully virialized on scales @xmath192 , the tfs should be basically scale - independent in this scale range , because virial temperature @xmath186 is independent on radius , and clusters identified by @xmath193 is the same as @xmath194 . fig .",
    "13 shows the significant scale - dependence of the tfs , even at @xmath78 @xmath19 mpc .",

    "13 shows that all the tfs of @xmath108 @xmath19 mpc have similar shape , i.e. the tfs are scaling .",

    "13 ) , we analyze the problem of the size of x - ray clusters .",
    "observationally , x - ray clusters are described by their x - ray luminosity , flux weighted temperature and morphology .",
    "although for some individual clusters we have known their x - ray isophotes and therefore the aperture of the x - ray emission , the x - ray luminosity is generally published as pseudo - total luminosity which does not contain information about the spatial scale of clusters .",
    "the abell radius @xmath20 is not used as a condition in x - ray cluster identification . even for abell clusters ,",
    "there is also the ambiguity of whether the x - ray luminosity comes from cluster halos of larger than radius @xmath198 1.5 @xmath19 mpc . if clusters are fully virialized , the size uncertainty of the tfs is not important since the tfs are size - independent .",
    "however , in quasi - virialization state , the size - dependence of tfs is substantial .",

    ", the lcdm and ocdm can pass the tf test if most x - ray clusters used for the observed tf are on the scales of 0.75 and 1.5 @xmath19 mpc . on the other hand , to fit the scdm tf with observed data , the size of x - ray clusters should be in the range 1.5 -3 @xmath19 mpc , which is larger than the results of lcdm and ocdm by a factor of 2 .",
    "the role of the size of x - ray clusters can be more clearly illustrated by scdm model with normalization amplitude @xmath199 .",
    "fig.14 shows the tfs of the @xmath199 scdm model . in this case",
    ", the model - predicted tf can fit the data only if the size of x - ray clusters is in the range 6 to 12 @xmath19 mpc , which seems very unlikely .",
    "thus , one can conclude that for either the model of scdm or lcdm and ocdm , the simulated tfs can fit with observations , if only the size of the x - ray clusters used for constructing the tfs is , on average , larger than their virial radius .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the configuration of x - ray clusters generally is irregular and substructured .",
    "obviously , the scale - dependence of the tfs can be employed for discriminating among models if the information of the size of x - ray clusters is available .",
    "currently , we are lacking of the data of x - ray cluster sizes .",
    "instead , one can consider the test of tf plus two - point correlation function . as it has been shown in figs .",
