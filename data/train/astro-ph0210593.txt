    "the first trans - neptunian binary ( tnb ) was identified in 1978 with the discovery of charon , pluto s moon ( christy and harrington 1978 ) .",

    "more discoveries have followed in rapid succession ( table 1 ) so that , as of february 2002 , a total of six trans - neptunian binaries were known .",
    "the discovery of tnbs opens up a significant new tool for physical study of trans - neptunian objects ( tno ) . through analysis of the orbit ,",
    "it offers the only direct means of determining the mass of these distant objects for the forseeable future .",
    "when combined with optical and thermal wavelength photometry , density can also be determined .",
    "both mass and density have _ a priori _ uncertainties of at least an order of magnitude for tnos , so the value of direct observations can not be underestimated .",
    "binaries offer further opportunities for physical study through mutual occultations .",
    "the series of pluto - charon mutual events that occurred soon after the discovery of charon led to surface albedo maps and separate spectra , revealing the very distinct surface compositions of pluto and its satellite ( buie et al .",

    "tnos have periods of 250 years or more so it will be necessary to discover and determine the orbits of approximately 10 tnbs before it will be likely to find one having mutual occultations within the next decade .",
    "two tnos ,  and , are the focus of this work .  was discovered at mauna kea observatory by chen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and  was discovered at kitt peak national observatory by the deep ecliptic survey team ( millis , et al .",
    "both objects are classical tnos in orbits of small eccentricity and low inclination . in this paper",
    "we describe the discovery of binary companions to  and , making them the seventh and eighth known tnbs ( noll and stephens 2002 , noll et al .",
    "and  were observed as part of a large photometric survey of tnos that we are carrying out using the hubble space telescope .",
    "the data were dark - subtracted , flat - fielded , and flux calibrated using standard stsci on - the - fly pipeline calibration steps including up - to - date dark files .",
    "cosmic ray hits were removed by combining pairs of filtered observations with the standard crrej routine found in the stsdas iraf software package ( baggett et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we used the wfall aperture , centered at pixel 133 , 149 on the wf3 chip ( biretta et al .",
    "2001 ) , for all observations in our photometric survey .",
    "this is the corner of the wf3 chip nearest the x and y readout registers , a position that reduces the magnitude of the charge transfer efficiency correction required ( whitmore et al .",
    "1999 , dolphin 2000 ) . the wfall aperture was also chosen to increase the likelihood of finding objects with uncertain ephemeris positions .",
    "the telescope was tracked during all observations correcting both for the proper motion of the tno and the parallax induced by hubble s orbital motion .    in followup observations of  we placed the target on the pc chip to take advantage of the better sampling on that detector .",
    "as with the other observations , the telescope was tracked at the apparent rate of the tno .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    was first imaged by us from 6:44 to 7:22 ut on 17 november 2001 when it was at a distance of 41.85 au from the earth .",
    "we obtained images with the wfpc2 camera on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in three broad band filters approximating v ( f555w ) , r ( f675w ) , and i ( f814w ) bands .",
    "there were two 160 second exposures in each filter .",
    "the sequence started with a single f555w exposure , followed by two each in f675w and f814w , and ended with a second single f555w .",
    "we identified  in our images both by its lack of motion relative to tracking and by its position at 66,92 on the wf3 chip , 8.76 arcsec from the predicted position .",
    "stars and galaxies in the field moved by a total of 0.46 arcsec between the first and last exposure .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the image of  is clearly elongated .",
    "the orientation of the spacecraft was such that north is approximately 30 degrees from the vertical in our images as indicated by the long arrow .",
    "the axis of the elongation is rotated by 16@xmath04 degrees east of north relative to the brighter of the two components , component @xmath1 .",
    "the elongation appears in all six individual images at a similar angle and separation .",
    "we note that the direction of the elongation is almost perpendicular to the apparent motion of stars and galaxies which moved diagonally from east to west in the images as shown .",
    "we also examined engineering data that tracks jitter during the observations .",
    "no unusual jitter was seen , ruling this out as a possible source of error .",
    "based on this visual evidence , we concluded that  is a probable binary and proceeded to obtain confirming images .",
    "three additional sets of observations of  were made from 7:30 to 8:26 ut on 18 june 2002 , 3:09 to 4:05 ut on 30 june 2002 , and 3:39 - 4:35 ut on 12 july 2002 . on each date we obtained three 800 second exposures in the f814w filter with the  on the pc chip .",
    "in all three cases the binary was easily detected and clearly resolved , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the higher resolution of the pc , the better s / n resulting from longer integrations , and obvious presence of the two components on four separate dates leaves no doubt about the binarity of .",

    ", the observing sequence began and ended with an f555w exposure .",
    "a pair of f814w exposures occurred between the f555ws . because  is fainter",
    ", we exposed this object in only two filters with two 260 second exposures per filter .",
    "the brighter component of , component @xmath1 , was found 0.58 arcsec from the wfall aperture at pixel 133,155 . a second , fainter object , component @xmath2 ,",
    "can be seen to the east in figure 2 at pixel 138 , 161 .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 were stationary during the observations .",
    "stars and galaxies were trailed , moving a total of 1.1 arcsec from the first to last exposure .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the two components of  are cleanly separated by an angular distance of 0.78@xmath00.03 arcsec at a position angle of 106.6@xmath02.5 degrees measured from @xmath1 .",
    "was subsequently observed from the keck i telescope ( fig .  3 , romanishin et al .  2002 ) .",
    "on the night of 11 april 2002 ( ut )  was observed in four ten - minute integrations simultaneously in b and r bands using the lris instrument in imaging mode .",
    "the images were individually bias - subtracted and flat - fielded and then combined into a single image . for the combined image shown in figure 3 ,",
    "the individual exposures were shifted to align the images of  which was moving at -0.235 arcsec / hr in ra and 0.00 arcsec / hr in dec . as can be seen in figure 3 ,",
    "appears elongated in the east - west direction with the fainter component to the east .",
    "romanishin et al .",
    "report a separation of 0.8@xmath00.2 arcsec at a position angle of 103@xmath05 degrees .",
    "this matches the orientation seen in the wfpc2 image and confirms the presence of the companion .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    in order to determine the separation and to obtain separate photometric magnitudes for the two components of  in the november data we fit the observed image by iteratively combining scaled synthetic point - spread functions ( psf ) generated by the tinytim software tool ( krist et al .",
    "an example is shown in figure 4 .",
    "both the separation and the relative magnitude of the components were allowed to vary . after finding a preliminary fit",
    ", we repeated the procedure over a finer grid .",
    "a best fit was determined by finding the parameters that yielded a minimum in the least squares residuals between the model and observed data .",
    "errors were estimated from the residuals .    from the iterative fit we determined a mean separation of 0.20@xmath00.03 arcsec on 17 november 2001 .",
    "we note that this is 0.04 arcsec larger than reported by noll & stephens ( 2002 ) because the separation of the psf centers is slightly larger than the separation of the peaks in the brightness distribution .",
    "this separation is near the resolution limit of the wide field portion of wfpc2 where the pixel scale is 0.1 arcsec / pixel , though it is sufficiently large that the two components can be reliably resolved .",
    "we applied the same technique to determine separations in the june / july 2002 data , even though the objects are clearly resolved and separate .",
    "positional information is summarized in table 2 .",
    "magnitudes are converted to the standard johnson - cousins system using the synphot software package .",
    "details of our photometric pipeline are described in more detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we measure a johnson v magnitude of v = 23.78@xmath00.13 and cousins r and i magnitudes of r = 23.27@xmath00.19 , i = 22.54@xmath00.09 for the component @xmath1 .",
    "component @xmath2 was found to have v = 24.02@xmath00.22 , r = 23.54@xmath00.23 , and i = 23.06@xmath00.18 ( table 3 ) .",
    "the photometry we obtained in june / july 2002 is generally consistent with the i band magnitudes determined in november 2001 as detailed in table 3 .",
    "the one exception is the unusually faint magnitude recorded for the component @xmath1 on 18 june 2002 .",
    "the faintness initially caused us to misidentify the components in this image , but when combined with the other images and possible mutual orbits , it is clear that on 18 june @xmath1 is almost a full magnitude fainter than on the other three dates when we measured it .",
    "note , in particular , that the observations in june and july 2002 were each separated by approximately 12 days .",
    "this is far shorter than any plausible period for the binary as discussed below .",
    "and there is essentially no change between the 30 june and 12 july magnitudes for either component . finally , the measured magnitude of component @xmath2 is almost identical in all four observations .",
    "it is possible that the unusually low measured magnitude for component @xmath1 is due to some unrecognized observational error .",
    "it is also possible that @xmath1 has an intrinsic lightcurve with a large amplitude .",
    "further observations to set limits on lightcurves would be valuable .",
    "the discovery of binaries is valuable because it offers the possibility of determining the mass and density of the objects , basic physical parameters that would otherwise require spacecraft to measure .",
    "we have not yet determined the orbits for either of the binaries that we have detected .",
    "it is possible , however , to make estimates of diameter and mass by making assumptions about the albedo and density of the objects and using measured magnitudes .",
    "if we assume an albedo of q=0.04 as is customarily done for tnos , we find that the two components of  have diameters of d(a)=220 km and d(b)=200 km following the formalism of romanishin and tegler ( 1999 ) .",
    "if we further assume a bulk density of 1 g @xmath3 , we calculate a combined mass of 9.76@xmath4 g , or 1/1500th the mass of pluto and charon .",
    "it is also possible to make educated guesses about possible orbital periods as we discuss separately below .      on january 12 , 2002 ,",
    "was 41.30 au from the earth . at this distance ,",
    "the angular separation we observed , 0.78 arcsec , corresponds to a minimum separation of 23,360 km .",
    "because of the wide separation , we were able to measure individual magnitudes for each component of the binary with standard aperture photometry using the iraf phot routine .",
    "we used an aperture radius of 3 pixels and a background annulus with inner diameter of 20 pixels and a thickness of 20 pixels .",
    "an aperture correction factor was calculated using synthetic psfs .",
    "we determined v = 24.25@xmath0 0.11 and i = 22.99@xmath0 0.08 for the brighter component @xmath1 and v = 25.12@xmath0 0.24 and i = 23.55@xmath0 0.13 for the component @xmath2 ( table 3 ) .",
    "the uncertainties are relatively large , especially for the fainter component @xmath2 , because of the faintness of these objects .",
    "@xmath1 is one of the faintest tnos we have observed and the @xmath2 is more than a magnitude fainter than the nominal magnitude limit we used for target selection .",
    "significantly fainter companions would not be detected by our relatively short integrations .",
    "romanishin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) report that the two components of  differ by 0.6@xmath00.2 mags in the r band , consistent with hst relative photometry .",
    "absolute photometry with the keck data has not been reported .",
    "using the same procedure as we did for , we estimate diameters for the two components to be d(@xmath1)=170 km and d(@xmath2)=120 km for an albedo of 0.04 . assuming a density of @xmath5 = 1 g @xmath3 we find a combined mass of 3.48@xmath4 g , 4200 times less than pluto and charon .",
    "it is possible to estimate the period of tnbs using kepler s third law by making an assumption about the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "this exercise is necessary in order to plan followup observations and is also useful as a yardstick for comparison with the actual orbit once it is known .",
    "we note that of the two tnbs with measured orbits , one , pluto / charon is nearly circular , while the other ,  has an eccentricity of e=0.8 ( veillet et al .",
    "2002 ) .    for our initial",
    "guess we assumed that e=0 and that the observed separation in november 2001 , a=6070 km , is the semimajor axis . for this set of assumptions",
    "we derive an orbital period of 42.6 days .",
    "we used this value to plan our followup observations in june and july 2002 .",
    "the separation we observed in june / july 2002 was larger , an average of 10,200 km . using the same assumptions",
    ", this would yield a period of 92 days .",
    "the four epochs of observation allow us to determine some basic facts about the orbit of .",
    "as can be seen in table 2 , on the dates in june and july 2002 , each separated by approximately 12 days , the position angle measured from component @xmath1 to @xmath2 increases steadily .",
    "the average rate over the nearly 24 days from 18 june to 12 july 2002 is 0.281 degrees / day .",
    "however , the average rate from 17 november to 18 june , a period of 212.85 days , must be significantly higher , averaging 1.494 degrees / day .",
    "we have insufficient data to resolve these discrepant rates .",
    "it is apparent , however , that the orbital plane is inclined relative to our line of sight and/or the orbit is significantly eccentric .",
    "additional observations will be required to determine the orbit of .",
    "if we perform the same exercise for  we find an orbital period for a circular orbit would be 539 days , comparable to the 547 day period of  ( veillet et al .  2002 ) and significantly longer than the apparent period of .",
    "the similarity of position angles observed in january and april 2002 is consistent with a long period , though the uncertainties are sufficiently large that nothing more quantitative can be said .",
    "the v - i color index can be computed for each binary component from the measured v and i photometry .",
    "color can , in principle , be used to infer the surface composition and resurfacing history of tnos ( c.f .",
    "jewitt & luu 2001 ) . in the 75 objects surveyed by us ,",
    "v - i ranges from 0.8 to 1.6 , which is to be compared to v - i(sun)=0.71 .",
    "that is , tno colors range from neutral to extremely red , as has been noted before ( luu & jewitt 1996 ) .",
    "the colors of  and  are listed in table 3 .",
    "the brighter @xmath1 components of both binaries have colors , v - i @xmath6 1.25 , that are average for classical tnos observed in our survey .",
    "their companions differ by about 1-sigma , more neutral in the case of @xmath2 and redder in the case of @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties in the colors are sufficiently large that we can not reach conclusions beyond stating that @xmath2 is unlikely to have neutral colors while @xmath2 is not significantly more red than @xmath1 . future observations that reduce the photometric uncertainties will be required to reach stronger conclusions .",
    "we have observed 75 tnos so far in our photometric survey using hst and have examined all of these for possible binary companions .",
    "of those 75 , we have detected companions to 3 , , , and the previously known binary .",
    "this statistic applies to companions with separations greater than @xmath60.15 arcsec and v - band differences of less than @xmath61 mag .",
    "although  was identified as a binary prior to its inclusion in our target list , the magnitude of  and the precision of its orbit determination matched the criteria for inclusion and it would have been added even if the binary were not known .",
    "also , the order in which snapshot targets are scheduled is random and outside the control of the observers .",
    "the probablility that  would have been observed at this point in our observing program is approximately 50% .",
    "given these considerations , we believe it is proper to consider  as part of an unbiased sample .",
    "we then conclude that the frequency of binaries consistent with the limits above is simply 3/75 or @xmath7% .",
    "we note that , because of the large statistical uncertainty , the exclusion of from the sample would not alter this conclusion substantially .",
    "a frequency of @xmath7% is in marginal agreement with the detection of 8 tnbs out of a total of more than 500 tnos detected to date .",
    "however , the uneven sampling and data quality of this larger population complicates any statistical conclusions from this larger sample .",
    "many of the objects have been observed only a few times and some are effectively lost .",
    "many of the detected binaries ,  for example , could not be detected by most ground - based systems including those equipped with adaptive optics .",
    "is just detectable with ground - based systems , and indeed has been verified as binary from the ground ( romanishin & tegler et al .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude limit and angular resolution in individual observations of tnos is a strong function of equipment and observing conditions .",
    "nevertheless , the overall detection rate of @xmath8% supports the rate inferred from our more uniform survey .",
    "it is worth noting that half of known tnbs , four of eight , have been discovered with hst ( trujillo and brown 2002 , brown and trujillo 2002 , noll and stephens 2002 , noll et al .",
    "since far more observations of tnos are made by groundbased telescopes than by hst , this fact would appear to imply that tnbs separated by more than an arcsecond are less frequent than more closely spaced companions , an assertion borne out by table 1 when one considers that 1 arcsec at 40 au is a physical distance of 29,000 km .",
    "we also note that all three of the binaries detected by us and five of the eight objects in table 1 are classical tnos .",
    "two are in the 3:2 resonance and one is possibly a scattered object . of the 75 objects observed in our program so far ,",
    "65% are classical tnos with low eccentricity and inclination , 24% are plutinos , and 11% are scattered disk objects",
    ". there does not seem to be sufficient evidence at present to make any conclusions about the relative frequency of binaries in the different dynamical populations , though eventually this information may be useful in determining the origin and history of tnbs and the dynamical classes in the kuiper belt .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to make a comparison between tnbs and binaries found in the main belt and near - earth populations .",
    "a total of 6 binaries have been identified out of a sample of 300 main - belt targets by merline et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , a rate , at first glance , roughly similar to that being found in the kuiper belt .",
    "however , it must be noted that the relative sizes and separations of main belt and kuiper belt binaries appear to be significantly different ( margot 2002 ) . if a population of tnbs with faint and close - in companions , similar to the main belt binaries , exists , the fraction of tnbs could be significantly higher than our current estimate .",
    "if collisions are the main source of binaries in both populations , the frequency of binaries , and their orbital and size distribution can be used to probe the efficiency of binary formation from such events .",
    "the near - earth asteroid ( nea ) population has a higher frequency of binaries , as high as 16% for objects over 200 m in diameter ( margot et al .",
    "however , mechanisms other than collisions , e.g. tidal breakup , may be responsible for this larger number among the neas and this population may be less relevant for comparison to tnbs ."
