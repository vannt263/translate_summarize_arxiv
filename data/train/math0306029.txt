    "there is an unfortunate clash on the notion of a _ toric manifold _ ; for instance , a toric manifold for geometers is a smooth toric variety , however , for an algebraic topologist , it is a smooth , even dimensional real manifold acted upon by a compact torus such that the quotient is homeomorphic to a simple convex polytope as a manifold with corners . at first",
    ", the class of the latter objects seems to contain the formers ( indeed , davis @xmath1 januszkiewicz @xcite claimed to do so ) , we provide an example showing that ( see example [ exa2 ] ) it is not the case . on the other hand , it is known that any smooth toric variety associated with a fan arising from a polytopal simplicial complex is a toric manifold in the latter sense @xcite .",
    "conversely , our example [ exa1 ] exhibits an almost complex quasitoric manifold that does not arise from a smooth toric variety . to distinguish these two classes , buchstaber @xmath1 panov @xcite prefer to call a toric manifold of davis @xmath1 januszkiewicz a _ quasitoric manifold _ , so do we , and preserve the term _ toric manifold _ for smooth toric varieties .",
    "the geometric and computational flavor of the theory enables us to translate topological problems into combinatorial ones and vice verse . in this guise ,",
    "the existence of an almost complex structure compatible with the action on a given quasitoric manifold may be formulated as a combinatorial property carried by the associated simple polytope and the characteristic map , which we characterize in theorem [ t1 ] .    in recent years",
    ", masuda s work on unitary torus manifolds @xcite contributes to the theory from an unfashionable manner . instead of starting with some combinatorial ingredients , he begins with a closed , connected , stably complex manifold @xmath2 equipped with a @xmath3-action such that the @xmath3-fixed point set is nonempty and isolated , and then he recovers a combinatorial object called _ multi - fan _ associated to @xmath2 .",
    "it can be verified that the class of unitary torus manifolds contains all quasitoric and toric manifolds . however",
    ", this containment is strict by example [ exa4 ] . moreover , under certain restrictions , we can easily adopt our programme in order to characterize the existence of an almost complex structure on unitary torus manifolds ( see corollary [ c1 ] ) .",
    "our first purpose here is to characterize the existence of an almost complex structure on quasitoric manifolds in terms of the related simple polytopes and dicharacteristic maps .",
    "so we begin with introducing some notations , and we refer readers to @xcite for a more detailed expositions in the theory .",
    "let @xmath2 be a quasitoric manifold over @xmath4 and let @xmath5 be the set of facets of @xmath4 .",
    "then for each @xmath6 , the pre - image @xmath7 is a submanifold @xmath8 with isotropy group a circle @xmath9 in @xmath3 .",
    "since there is a one - to - one correspondence ( up to a sign ) between the set of primitive vectors in @xmath10 and the subcircles in @xmath3 , we obtain the _ characteristic map _ of @xmath2 given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 generates the circle @xmath9 in @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the map @xmath13 is well defined only up to a sign , and if the sign of each @xmath14 is chosen , we then call @xmath13 a _ dicharacteristic map _ of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath15 dicharacteristic maps in total attached to @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "each such choice for @xmath14 determines an orientation of the normal bundle @xmath16 of @xmath17 , so an orientation for @xmath17 .",
    "conversely , an _ omniorientation _ of @xmath2 consists of a choice of an orientation for every submanifold @xmath17 , which in turn settles a sign for each vector @xmath14 .",
    "thus , every omniorientation is equipped with a unique dicharacteristic map and vice versa .",
    "buchstaber @xmath1 ray @xcite were able to show that any omniorientation of @xmath2 induces a stably complex structure on it by means of the following isomorphism :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the pull back of the line bundle corresponding to the thom class defined by @xmath16 along the pontryagin - thom collapse .",
    "since @xmath4 is simple , each vertex @xmath20 of @xmath4 can be written as an intersection of @xmath21 facets : @xmath22    assign to each facet @xmath23 the edge @xmath24 , and let @xmath25 be the vector along @xmath26 beginning at @xmath20 .",
    "then , depending on the ordering of the facets , the vectors @xmath27 form either positively or negatively oriented basis of @xmath28 . throughout this ordering",
    "is assumed to be so that @xmath27 is a positively oriented basis .    for a given dicharacteristic map @xmath13 , we define @xmath29 to be the @xmath30-matrix whose @xmath31-th column is formed by the vector @xmath32 for any @xmath33 .",
    "we let @xmath34 denote the maximal minor of @xmath29 formed by the columns @xmath35 , where @xmath36 . from the definition of a characteristic map",
    ", we have that @xmath37 for any vertex @xmath38 .",
    "the _ sign _ of a vertex @xmath38 is defined to be @xmath39    [ t1 ] an omniorientation of a quasitoric manifold @xmath2 over @xmath4 arises from a @xmath3-invariant almost complex structure on @xmath2 if and only if @xmath40 for each vertex @xmath41 .    the necessity part of the claim has already appeared in @xcite , so for the sufficiency , assume that @xmath40 for each vertex @xmath41 . however , this guaranties that the euler number of the resulting stably complex structure equals to the euler number of @xmath2 ; hence , it arises from an almost complex structure by the proposition @xmath42 of @xcite .",
    "it means that the complex structure @xmath43 on @xmath44 splits as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are complex structures on @xmath48 and the trivial portion respectively",
    ". however , since @xmath43 is @xmath3-invariant , so is @xmath46 .    on the other hand , the assumption @xmath40 for each vertex @xmath41",
    "prevails the fact that each @xmath9-fixed submanifolds @xmath17 has an almost complex structure induced by that of @xmath2 .",
    "this may be achieved systematically by obtaining the dicharacteristic map of @xmath17 from that of @xmath2 such a way that for each fixed point of @xmath17 , the sign of the corresponding vertex is equal to @xmath49 .",
    "once we described almost complex structures on quasitorics , it would be of interest to find an example of an almost complex quasitoric that is not a toric manifold , since all known almost complex quasitoric manifolds at the moment are also toric manifolds ( see problem @xmath50 of @xcite ) .",
    "[ exa1 ] let @xmath51 be the quasitoric @xmath0-manifold over the pentagon @xmath52 oriented counterclockwise shown by the figure [ aq ] with the given dicharacteristic map ( compare to the list given in [ @xcite , p.@xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the connected sum .",
    "the triangle part of @xmath52 corresponds to the base polytope of @xmath55 , and the quadruple portion for @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the complex projective plane with the reversed orientation .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath58 for any @xmath59 .",
    "hence , by the theorem [ t1 ] , the resulting stably complex structure on @xmath60 is induced by a @xmath61-invariant almost complex structure .",
    "however , @xmath60 can not have the diffeomorphic type ( or even homeomorphic type ) of a toric manifold by the classification theorem of fischli @xmath1 yavin @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath60 is an almost complex quasitoric manifold which is not a toric manifold .",
    ", width=326,height=259 ]    we next present a toric manifold that is not a quasitoric manifold .    [ exa2 ] let @xmath62 denote the barnette sphere , which is a star - shaped , non - polytopal simplicial @xmath63-sphere ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "since it is star - shaped , it spans a complete fan @xmath64 in @xmath65 that may not be necessarily smooth .",
    "however , applying a finite number of stellar subdivision , we can turn @xmath64 into a smooth fan , which we still continue to denote by @xmath64 .",
    "since the non - polytopality of @xmath62 comes from the fact that it has a double edge , the stellar subdivision on @xmath62 will not remove such an edge so that the underlying simplicial sphere of @xmath64 is still non - polytopal .",
    "if we denote the associated toric manifold by @xmath66 , it contains an algebraic torus as a dense subset that acts on @xmath66 smoothly .",
    "furthermore , the quotient of @xmath66 by the action of the compact @xmath0-torus included in the algebraic torus is a @xmath0-ball whose facial structure is not isomorphic to a simple convex polytope .",
    "thus , the toric manifold @xmath66 can not be a quasitoric manifold .",
    "during the @xmath67s much of the effort in toric geometry was spent on the classification and the existence of toric manifolds in a purely combinatorial sense . from the geometric point of view , for a given simplicial complex @xmath68 , the existence of a fan @xmath69 associated with it depends on the star - shapness of @xmath68 .",
    "however , the smoothness of such a fan can be expressed as a realizability problem in synthetic geometry . in other words",
    ", we have to have a realization of @xmath69 in such a way that some determinant conditions are satisfied . in the projective case , where the complex @xmath68 is the boundary complex of a simplicial convex polytope , the neighborliness of the polytope puts more restriction on the existence of such realization .",
    "in fact , this is the key point on which gretenkort , et al @xcite was able to prove that there does not exits a smooth fan whose spanning simplicial complex is the boundary complex of a cyclic polytope with @xmath70 vertices . even though , the basic combinatorial ingredients for constructing quasitorics seem to be more flexible , when we require almost complex structures on them , similar synthetic geometry problems will appear .    instead of using the moment curve to construct a cyclic @xmath0-polytope @xmath71 with @xmath21 vertices",
    ", we may alternatively use the _ carath@xmath72odory curve _ ( see @xcite ) ; @xmath73 so that @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "we then denote by @xmath76 the _ dual _ ( or the _ polar _ when @xmath77 ) of @xmath71 .",
    "it follows that @xmath76 is a simple convex @xmath0-polytope .",
    "[ exa3 ] consider @xmath78 , and let @xmath79 be the cyclic polytope with vertices @xmath80 it is easy to verify that @xmath81 so that its polar @xmath82 exists . by the anti - isomorphism between the face lattices of @xmath79 and @xmath82",
    ", we denote the facets of @xmath82 by @xmath83 corresponding to the vertices of @xmath79 with the same indexes . by the gale s evenness condition and the choice of our realization",
    ", the list of positively ordered facets meeting at some vertex of @xmath82 can be given as follows : @xmath84    by analogy with the proof given in [ @xcite , p.257 ] , it can be shown that for any dicharacteristic map on @xmath82 , there is at least one vertex @xmath20 in the above list such that @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , there does not exist a dicharacteristic map on @xmath82 satisfying @xmath40 for each vertex @xmath86 ; hence , there is no almost complex quasitoric manifold with the base polytope @xmath82 realized as above .",
    "however , we may construct a stably complex quasitoric over @xmath82 with the dicharacteristic map given , for example by @xmath87    [ t2 ] there does not exist an almost complex quasitoric manifold over the polytope @xmath76 with @xmath70 .",
    "we first note that the existence of an almost complex structure is independent of any specific geometric realization of the polytope .",
    "therefore , when @xmath88 , the claim follows from the example [ exa3 ] .",
    "a similar reason applies to the case @xmath89 .",
    "since the class of multi - fans contains all convex polytopes as well as fans , the unitary torus manifolds may be thought of a generalization of quasitoric and toric manifolds . in this circumstance",
    ", it would be interesting to clarify this containment .",
    "in other words , it is not clear whether there exists a unitary torus manifold that is neither a quasitoric nor a toric manifold .",
