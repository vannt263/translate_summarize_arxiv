    "ghost imaging is an active - imaging technique that uses time - varying structured illumination to image a target without spatially - resolving measurements of the light beam that interacts with the target .",
    "traditionally , a beam splitter is used to create two perfectly - correlated beams , the signal and reference , such that the signal interacts with the target and is then measured by a single - pixel bucket detector , while the reference is directly measured by a spatially - resolving detector @xcite . as the illumination pattern is varied , the two measurements are correlated until the spatial structure of the target is determined .",
    "neither measurement alone is sufficient to produce the image ; it is their cross - correlation that holds the desired target information , i.e. , the ghost image .",
    "the first ghost - imaging experiment relied on entangled photon - pairs ",
    "obtained from spontaneous parametric downconversion  for its signal and reference fields , so it was believed that the ghost image was a uniquely quantum feature @xcite , namely nonlocal two - photon interference .",
    "later , ghost imaging was performed with classical pseudothermal light @xcite , and a controversy arose as to whether these experiments could be explained by the intensity correlation between classical signal and reference fields or _ only  by nonlocal two - photon interference .",
    "subsequent gaussian - state analysis provided a unified treatment of downconverter and pseudothermal ghost imaging , showing that the stronger - than - classical correlation of entangled photons yielded better contrast and near - field resolution @xcite , and that the quantum and semiclassical treatments of the pseudothermal imager gave quantitatively - identical performance predictions .",
    "more recently , the intensity cross - correlation versus nonlocal two - photon interference controversy for understanding pseudothermal ghost imaging has been ended through analysis demonstrating that these two explanations can co - exist @xcite .",
    "_    once pseudothermal ghost imaging is considered in the framework of structured - illumination imaging , it becomes possible to dispense with a physically - realized reference field . in particular ,",
    "deterministic modulation of a laser beam with a spatial light modulator ( slm ) can provide the signal field used for target interrogation , while the on - target intensity pattern needed for the reference field can then be calculated via diffraction theory @xcite .",
    "the extension of ghost imaging to this computational framework has opened the door for a variety of applications , including demonstration of ghost imaging with phase - sensitive classical light @xcite , and image reconstruction via compressed sensing , instead of correlation @xcite .",
    "pseudothermal ghost imaging has been experimentally done in reflection both in laboratory @xcite and remote - sensing scenarios @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent work analyzing reflective ghost imaging indicates that computational reflective ghost imaging is feasible for remote sensing @xcite , and computed reference beams can be generated for all target ranges of interest , so that computational ghost imaging has unlimited depth of focus , unlike its pseudothermal counterpart .",
    "so far , however , there has only been a cursory performance comparison between computational ghost imaging and an imaging laser radar for this application @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis in @xcite of a continuous - wave reflective ghost imager to a pulsed , computational ghost - imaging system that is capable of performing three - dimensional imaging , and we compare its behavior to that of a pulsed , floodlight - illumination , imaging laser radar .",
    "we present results for their spatial resolutions and signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) when imaging rough - surfaced targets that produce fully - developed laser speckle and the propagation to and from the targets is through atmospheric turbulence .",
    "we also investigate the trade - off between spatial resolution and snr as a function of detector and entrance - pupil sizes . as reflective ghost - imaging systems are only subject to spatial - resolution loss from turbulence in the source - to - target path @xcite , whereas a floodlight - illumination laser radar s spatial resolution is only degraded by turbulence in the target - to - receiver path , we consider arbitrary turbulence distributions on all optical paths .    , from the range-@xmath0 return associated with the @xmath1th transmitted pulse .",

    "the principal difference between the fields transmitted by the ghost imager and the laser radar lies in their normalized spatial modes , @xmath17 .",

    "the reader is cautioned , however , that the gaussian statistics we have assumed will not be valid until sufficient propagation away from the slm has occurred that the central limit theorem can be applied to the superposition of the many phase - modulated field elements from that modulator s pixels .",

    "the preceding noise terms were present  albeit with somewhat different scaling factors  in the snr expression for continuous - time ghost imaging @xcite , but the @xmath174 noise - denominator term in eq .   is a heretofore unencountered consequence of time - varying turbulence during the measurement interval . when the turbulence is frozen across all @xmath16 pulses , this term disappears , but when the turbulence changes during the measurement it creates randomness in the on - target illumination patterns that changes from pulse to pulse .",
    "this new randomness is suppressed by increasing the number of pulses used to form the ghost image .",
    "to appreciate the impact of this new term , consider the worst - case scenario , in which the turbulence decorrelates pulse - to - pulse , the new term dominates the noise denominator , and @xmath16 is to be chosen to achieve a desired snr while still under the sway of this term . here",
    "we find that the necessary @xmath16 value is proportional to the _",
    "square  of the number of spatial - resolution cells on the target .",
    "in contrast , were there no time variation to the turbulence  so that the fourth noise term vanished",
    " then @xmath16 would only need to be proportional to the number of on - target spatial - resolution cells to achieve the desired snr when the first and/or third noise terms dominate the second .",
    "because increasing @xmath16 with @xmath25 fixed increases the image acquisition time , the fourth noise term can have a significant adverse impact on that acquisition time .",
    "_    having described the various noise contributions to the ghost - image snr , let us conclude this section by highlighting two physically - important asymptotic forms of eq .  .",
    "when the number of pulses increases without bound , the ghost - image snr reaches a finite limit , called the saturation snr , which is given by @xmath175 note that it is due solely to the time - independent target speckle @xcite , and is independent of the target s range and reflectivity , although the @xmath6 and @xmath16 values needed to reach the saturation regime do depend on @xmath83 .",
    "this saturation snr can only be increased by increasing @xmath176 , which means either increasing the size of the bucket detector , or decreasing the size of the source , with the latter entailing a degradation of the ghost imager s spatial - resolution capability .",
    "when the average number of detected target - return photons is so low that shot noise dominates all other fluctuations in the ghost image , we get the shot - noise - limited snr @xmath177 unlike the case for its saturation signal - to - noise ratio , the ghost imager s shot - noise limited snr _",
    "does  depend on the target s range and reflectivity .",
    "the @xmath178-pixel laser radar image for range @xmath0 is formed from the pixel - wise outputs @xmath179 of a ccd  on which the target - reflected light has been focused by a lens  that have been matched - filtered for range @xmath0 .",
    "these photocurrents take the form @xmath180 & \\times & \\left[q\\eta\\int\\!d{\\bm\\rho}'_i\\,\\mathcal{a}_p^2({\\bm\\rho}'_i)|e_p({\\bm\\rho}'_i,\\tau)|^2 + \\delta i_p(\\tau)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where : @xmath181 is the real - valued field - transmission pupil function defining the photosensitive region of the @xmath182th image - plane pixel , which we take to be centered at @xmath183 to compensate for image inversion ; @xmath184 is the complex envelope of the light impinging on the ccd plane at point @xmath185 and time @xmath186 ; and @xmath187 is the photocurrent shot noise for pixel @xmath182 .    in practice",
    "the lens focal length will cast a minified image on the ccd , but , for convenience , we will assume it is chosen to realize 1:1 imaging for range @xmath188 , which is taken to be the center of the range - interval of interest .",

    "the laser radar then produces its range-@xmath0 image by pixel - wise averaging the photocurrents from the @xmath16 pulses , @xmath192    before turning to our spatial - resolution analysis , there is an important point to make about depth of focus , cf .  the discussion at the end of sec  [ sec : gires ] about this issue for the ghost imager .",
    "when @xmath193 for all target ranges of interest , the laser radar can be focused at infinity with no loss of spatial resolution at any of those ranges . however , when @xmath194 for target ranges of interest , then the radar receiver must operate within the depth of focus for the range to be imaged in order to prevent loss of spatial resolution .",
    "the rest of our treatment of the laser radar will assume that the far - field condition , @xmath193 , holds , so that all target ranges of interest will be in focus , but this need not always be the case in operational scenarios of interest .      the laser radar s spatial resolution is found from its average image , just as was done for the ghost imager . as we did in sec .",

    "turbulence begins to impair the laser radar s spatial resolution when its receiver - plane coherence length , @xmath71 , becomes comparable to the receiver s lens radius , @xmath72 .",

    "so , as we did there , we shall assume that all significant target detail is resolved by the imager , and that the turbulence is weak enough that we can ignore its fluctuation - terms coordinate dependence in the planes of the transmitter , target , and receiver .",
    "with the first assumption , eq .",

    "the laser radar s second - moment calculation , however , is substantially simpler than that for the ghost imager in that the laser radar case only requires turbulence and target fourth - moments and the shot noise s second moment .",
    "consequently , the evaluation proceeds as follows .",
    "first , we use the statistical independence of the turbulence , target , and shot noise to separate averages involving these three randomness contributors .",
    "then we employ gaussian moment - factoring to reduce the target s fourth moment into a sum of products of second moments , and our assumption about the coordinate - independence of the turbulence fluctuations to evaluate that fourth moment as we did for the ghost imager .",
    "next , we perform the resulting multi - dimensional fourier transforms of the gaussian functions that arise from far - field optical propagation in conjunction with the gaussian pupil functions we have assumed . finally , under our assumption that the laser radar resolves all significant target detail , we are left with @xmath212 where @xmath157 is the time - averaged turbulence factor from eq .  .",
    "the noise - denominator terms in the preceding snr formula have the following physical interpretations .",
    "the first term is due to the time - independent target speckle , exacerbated , to some degree , by the turbulence - induced scintillation on the transmitter - to - target and target - to - receiver paths .",
    "the second term is due to shot noise .",
    "thus when @xmath213the average number of photons transmitted over all @xmath16 pulses  is sufficiently high , the snr reaches a finite maximum value , namely the saturation signal - to - noise ratio , given by @xmath214 which depends only on @xmath215 , the number of diffraction - limited spots within the pixel area @xcite . increasing @xmath216 , e.g. , by increasing the pixel size ,",
    "will increase the saturation value , but doing so degrades the radar s spatial resolution ; see eq .  .",
    "conversely , when the snr is much lower than its saturation limit , it takes the shot - noise limited form @xmath217",
    "having completed spatial resolution and snr analyses for both the computational ghost imager and the laser radar , we are ready to compare their capabilities . before proceeding ,",
    "two points deserve note . the first concerns ensuring that our spatial resolution and snr comparisons are fair .",
    "toward that end we will take @xmath218 , so that the laser radar s on - target intensity pattern matches the ghost imager s average on - target intensity pattern .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath219 , because : ( 1 ) @xmath72 and @xmath27 correspond to intensity radii ( @xmath72 for the the intensity transmission of the radar receiver , and @xmath27 for the intensity transmission of the ghost imager s exit optics ) ; and ( 2 ) @xmath72 and @xmath27 determine the diffraction - limited spatial resolutions of these two imagers .",
    "in addition , we we will take @xmath220 , i.e. , the product of the average number of transmitted photons per pulse and the number of pulses employed for the ghost imager ( gi ) and the laser radar ( lr ) must be equal , but we will _ not  require @xmath221 and @xmath222 , as originally indicated in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] .",
    "thus we are constraining both systems to use the same average number of transmitted photons to form their images , but we are affording the laser radar the opportunity to exploit its ability to form an image from a single pulse , in contrast to the ghost imager s fundamental requirement for averaging the returns from multiple pulses . _",
    "our second pre - comparison note is cautionary .",
    "our analysis has employed gaussian functions for partially - coherent and coherent optical beams , and for photodetector pupil - functions , etc .",

    "although the use of gaussian functions should yield the correct dependence of these performance metrics on system parameters , the constant factors that appear in our results would be different had we numerically evaluated the spatial resolutions and snrs for circular - pupil optics .",
    "we have shown that the ghost imager and laser radar s average images for the target component at range @xmath78 convolve @xmath83 with gaussian point - spread functions of the form @xmath223 where @xmath224 \\sqrt{\\beta ' + \\alpha'}\\,\\rho_{z_k } ' , & \\mbox{laser radar},\\end{array}\\right . \\label{rescomp}\\ ] ] with @xmath144 and @xmath225 being the diffraction - limited resolutions , @xmath226 and @xmath227 accounting for turbulence - induced resolution loss , and @xmath228 for resolution lost because of finite pixel size .",

    "the numerical value of this resolution advantage depends on our use of gaussian functions , but the fact that the laser radar s diffraction - limited spatial resolution is better than that of the computational ghost imager does not , so long as the laser radar s receiver pupil is the same as the ghost imager s transmitter pupil .",
    "that this is so follows from the ghost imager s psf arising from convolution of the on - target average intensity pattern of its transmitter with the corresponding pattern from the computed reference , while the laser radar s psf ( in the 1:1 imaging setup we have assumed ) corresponds to just one of those patterns .    as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : lr ] , the laser radar must employ finite - sized pixels , and eq .",
    "shows that  other system parameters being held constant ",
    "forcing @xmath232 will push the system into its shot - noise limited regime as the pixel area , @xmath233 , is decreased .",
    "thus a prudent compromise might be to size the pixels to satisfy @xmath234 , so that the laser radar s spatial resolution , in the absence of turbulence , only suffers a @xmath231-factor increase .",
    "this choice of pixel size , however , wipes out the laser radar s spatial resolution advantage over the computational ghost imager , i.e. , the no - turbulence resolution of the former then exactly matches the diffraction - limited resolution of the latter .",
    "when turbulence is strong enough to dominate the spatial resolution of both imagers , we get @xmath235 \\lambda_0 z_k\\sqrt{w_d}/\\pi\\sqrt{2}\\,\\rho_d , & \\mbox{laser radar},\\end{array}\\right . \\label{turbres}\\ ] ] where we have continued our use of @xmath219 .",
    "for a situation in which @xmath236such as when the laser radar s receiver is co - located with the ghost - imager s transmitter  we find the turbulence - limited resolution to be equal for both systems .",
    "more generally , either system could have more favorable spatial - resolution behavior in the presence of turbulence because different turbulence - strength profiles could exist on the transmitter - to - target and target - to - receiver paths , and the ghost imager s spatial resolution is only sensitive to turbulence on the transmitter - to - target path while the laser radar s spatial resolution is only sensitive to the turbulence on the target - to - receiver path .      for our snr comparison we shall consider the two imagers saturation snrs and their shot - noise limited snrs .",
    "throughout we will assume that any turbulence that might be present has no effect on spatial resolution , so that @xmath237 , and that both imagers have sufficient resolution to resolve all significant detail in @xmath83 .",

    "consequently , the computational ghost - imager s saturation snr will greatly exceed that of the laser radar when @xmath241 , i.e. , when the bucket detector s area is much larger than the source area .",
    "there is a simple physical explanation for this behavior : the saturation snr is due to the time - independent speckle created by reflection from the rough - surfaced target .",
    "these speckles are @xmath242@xmath27 in radius in the receiver s pupil plane , so when @xmath243 , the bucket detector is averaging over many statistically independent speckles , driving up the ghost imager s saturation snr .",
    "there is , however , an intrinsic unfairness in the preceding favorable view of the ghost imager s saturation snr , because by fixing @xmath219 but letting @xmath243 , we are allowing the bucket detector to have a much larger receiving aperture than the laser radar .",
    "suppose , instead , that we constrain the systems to have the same size receiving aperture , so that @xmath244 , but maintain @xmath243 .",
    "in that case the laser radar s diffraction - limited spatial resolution would be better than that of the ghost imager by a factor of @xmath245 but its snr would be worse",
    ". however , the laser radar could then use @xmath246 and : ( 1 ) have its no - turbulence spatial resolution match the diffraction limit of the ghost imager ; and ( 2 ) have its saturation snr equal that of the ghost imager . in this case , the time - independent speckle is being averaged in the laser radar s image plane , because the large pixel comprises a great many independent speckle lobes .    finally , if we make all optics the same size , @xmath247 , and choose the pixel size for equal spatial resolutions , then @xmath248 and we find @xmath249 .    to summarize what we have seen so far concerning saturation - snr behavior ,",
    "fair comparisons between the ghost imager and the laser radar indicate that neither system will enjoy a significant advantage in this regard .",
    "there is , however , a fine point to be considered concerning atmospheric turbulence .",
    "we have assumed the relevant turbulence coherence lengths to be long enough that our imagers spatial resolutions do not lose any resolution arising from propagation over turbulent paths .",
    "nevertheless , the target - speckle terms in the noise denominators of eqs .   and both contain the time - averaged scintillation factor @xmath157 when a sufficient number of pulses are averaged  as has been assumed in the saturation snr formulas  we get @xmath250 . for the ghost imager",

    "give us @xmath255 for a fair comparison we again set @xmath248 , to give the systems the same pupil sizes and spatial resolutions .",
    "the preceding snr ratio then reduces to @xmath256 . for a range-@xmath78 target",
    "whose intensity - reflection coefficient has limited spatial variation , this number is approximately its number of spatial - resolution cells , making the laser radar s shot - noise limited snr far superior to that of the computational ghost imager . increasing",
    "the size of the ghost imager s bucket detector can overcome this snr disadvantage by making @xmath243 .",

    "unlike what we found for the laser radar s saturation snr , its shot - noise limited snr is the same at all @xmath258 values , i.e. , eq",
    ".   applies even when the laser radar forms its image from a single pulse .",
    "computational ghost imaging is , in many respects , a dual of floodlight - illumination laser radar .",
    "the computational ghost imager s system complexity is in its transmitter , whose sequence of slm patterns creates the structured illumination that provides the imager s spatial resolution .",
    "the laser radar s complexity lies in its ccd receiver , which provides its spatial resolution .",
    "consequently , the size of the ghost imager s transmitter pupil sets its diffraction - limited spatial resolution , whereas the laser radar s no - turbulence spatial resolution is set by the size of its receiver pupil in conjunction with that of its ccd pixels .",
    "thus only turbulence on the transmitter - to - target path can impair the ghost imager s spatial resolution , while the laser radar s spatial resolution is only impacted by turbulence on the target - to - receiver path . therefore , ghost imaging and laser radar systems that are designed to have equal spatial resolutions in the absence of turbulence could have significantly different performance in a bistatic configuration , in which their transmitters and and receivers are not co - located , so that significantly different turbulence distributions are encountered on these two paths . in such situations",
    "either one could offer the better spatial - resolution performance , depending on which path had its turbulence concentrated near the resolution - controlling pupil . aside from this turbulence issue",

    "( 1 ) the laser radar can form its image from a single pulse , making it far better for imaging moving targets ; and ( 2 ) the computational ghost imager has infinite depth of focus , whereas the laser radar will not for ranges satisfying @xmath194 . _    both the ghost imager and the laser radar have signal - to - noise ratios that are shot - noise limited at low-@xmath6 , low-@xmath16 values and saturate at high-@xmath6 , high-@xmath16 values .",
    "when their optics are sized for equal spatial resolutions , with @xmath259 and @xmath222 , there is little difference in their saturation snrs .",
    "this contrasts strongly with their shot - noise limited snr behavior , under these conditions , in which the laser radar outperforms the ghost imager by a factor approximately equal to the number of spatial - resolution cells on the target . as a result , we can expect that the ghost imager will require significantly more time to achieve a desired snr when operating in this regime .",
    "this key disadvantage for correlation - based ghost imaging could be mitigated to some degree , however , by the use of compressed - sensing techniques , which enable many fewer pulses to suffice for ghost - image formation .",
    "recent work has demonstrated this possibility in table - top ghost imaging done in reflection @xcite , indicating its likely feasibility for standoff - sensing applications .",
    "what then are the possible advantages of ghost imaging in comparison with laser radar ?",
    "the principal such advantage identified by our analysis accrues in bistatic configurations wherein , for operational reasons , the transmitter must be located in a region of weak turbulence but the receiver necessarily is in a strongly - turbulent region . beyond that , however , there are some technological possibilities .",
    "the ghost imager only requires a single - pixel detector , whereas the laser radar needs a detector array . for wavelength regions",
    "in which high - performance single - pixel detectors are available but similar - quality detector arrays are not , ghost imagers would provide active - imaging capability that laser radars could not .",
    "a related technological advantage arises for ghost imaging in multi - static configurations , in which a network of simple , small , single - pixel detectors view a target region that is floodlit by a single , large - aperture , structured - illumination transmitter .",
    "individual images could be formed from each detector s outputs to capture multiple views of the target , and allow for more averaging of the target - induced speckle .",
    "a corresponding multi - static laser radar would require high - resolution ccds at each receiver location , making it more complicated and more expensive than the ghost imager .",
    "ghost imagers intrinsically require multiple pulses to form an image , whereas a laser radar can provide an image from a single pulse .",
    "for now we will allow them to use the same number of pulses , but we will return to this distinction , in sec .  [",
    "sec : comp ] , after we have derived the two systems spatial resolution and snr behaviors .",
    "a typical slm would have square pixels of finite dimension and , for computational ghost imaging , be used to impress an array of random phases ( uniformly distributed on @xmath260 $ ] ) on an incident laser pulse . for analytical convenience , we are passing to a continuum limit for transverse coordinates , rather than discretizing space into pixels in these correlation functions .",
    "thus @xmath261 and @xmath262 roughly correspond to the slm s diameter and pixel size .",
    "the choice of a gaussian pupil function is made for analytical convenience ; a unity - transmission circular pupil could be used instead at the cost of more complicated formulas for noise terms in the snr analysis to follow , as well as in the performance comparison with the laser radar .        because the pulse - repetition interval , @xmath23 , is fixed , letting @xmath264 will necessarily drive the time - averaged turbulence factor @xmath157 to zero , hence it does not appear in the saturation snr expression ."
