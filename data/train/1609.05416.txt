    "starting from the basic framework constructed by zakharov and manakov @xcite and kaup @xcite , we review the general approaches developed by beals and coifman @xcite and zhou @xcite as applied to the twri equations . in appendices [ subapp : direct - scattering1][subapp : time - dependence ] we set up the direct - scattering transformation mapping the initial data to the scattering data . in appendices [ appb5-inverse - scattering ] and [ subapp - zhou - transform ]",
    "we formulate the inverse map as a riemann - hilbert problem . finally , as our focus is on pure - soliton solutions , in appendix [ sec : solitons ] we detail the construction of these functions from the riemann - hilbert problem and discuss some of their relevant properties .",

    "<S> the three - wave resonant interaction equations are a non - dispersive system of partial differential equations with quadratic coupling describing the time evolution of the complex amplitudes of three resonant wave modes . </S>",

    "<S> we analyze the collision of two or three packets in the semiclassical limit by applying the inverse - scattering transform . using wkb analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we construct an associated semiclassical soliton ensemble , a family of reflectionless solutions defined through their scattering data , intended to accurately approximate the initial data in the semiclassical limit . </S>",
    "<S> the map from the initial packets to the soliton ensemble is explicit and amenable to asymptotic and numerical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> plots of the soliton ensembles indicate the space - time plane is partitioned into regions containing either quiescent , slowly varying , or rapidly oscillatory waves . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior resembles the well - known generation of dispersive shock waves in equations such as the korteweg - de vries and nonlinear schrdinger equations , although the physical mechanism must be different in the absence of dispersion . </S>"
