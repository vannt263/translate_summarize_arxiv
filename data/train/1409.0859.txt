    "dark matter ( dm ) is a ubiquitous component of the universe .",
    "it dominates the mass density of virialized objects and has left its imprint at cosmological scales during the cosmic history ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the last decade ,",
    "the large wealth of data from large sky surveys such as , e.g. , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) have established that the dm budget is up to @xmath5 of the total mass density of the universe . numerical simulations of ( dm only ) structure formation within the consensus cosmology framework , i.e. the @xmath6cdm model , have provided accurate predictions on the dm density distribution in galaxies and clusters ( @xcite , hereafter nfw ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more realistic models , which have tried to evaluate the effect of baryons on the dm distribution , have been characterized either through some approximate recipes such as the adiabatic contraction ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which seems compatible with observations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) or to the simultaneous evolutions of the two components ( @xcite ) , making predictions on the expected dm fractions in the central galaxy regions @xcite .    within this context , the study of the mass density distribution and the dark - to - baryonic mass ratio of early - type galaxies ( etgs , ellipticals and lenticulars ) is a crucial problem that has to be addressed in a systematic way , as these systems contain most of the cosmic stellar mass of the universe and represent the final stage of galaxy evolution and contain the fossil record of the stellar and dm assembly through time .",
    "most of the current understanding of these systems is based on local galaxy samples .",
    "these have shown that the overall dm content depends crucially on the galaxy mass scale , which is possibly the effect of the overall star formation efficiency ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "dm has been found to be relevant in the central galaxy regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* t+09 , hereafter ) ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) where etgs show a substantial consistency with the concordance @xmath6cdm scenario ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and also some new scaling relations , like the one between dm fraction and formation epoch ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which still need to be confirmed and fully understood .    generally speaking",
    ", it has been shown that the central dm fraction ( typically within one effective radius ,  hereafter ) is larger in more massive and large ",
    "sized galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; t+09 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , even though there are also opposite claims from other studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although these trends are qualitatively unchanged independently of the adopted galaxy model or initial mass function , imf ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , they can still be strongly affected by the assumptions on the stellar , i.e. a non - homologous constant profile , as verified for the trend of the dm fraction as a function of mass ( e.g. @xcite ; t+09 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the inventory of the evidences accumulated so far is complicated if one takes into account the effect of a non universal imf ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which remains the largest source of uncertainty , since a systematic variation of the imf with mass , from a bottom - lighter imf for low mass systems to a bottom - heavier imf in massive galaxies would wipe out the `` apparent '' dm fraction trend with mass ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a robust assessment of all these correlations is crucial to have a clearer insight into the assembly of the two main galaxy components ( stars and dm ) , and thus into the formation mechanisms across time .",
    "unfortunately , with the currently available individual datasets , which generally cover small windows in redshift space , it is not possible to extend the investigation of the scaling relations found at lower@xmath7 to earlier epochs ( but see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite for gravitational lenses ) . only by accumulating data from different samples ,",
    "a more systematic study of the dm fraction evolution with redshift is becoming possible .",
    "this has been done , e.g. , using weak and/or strong lensing analyses ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) to find that at higher redshift results point to an evolution of the total virial - to - stellar ratio that is larger at higher redshift .",
    "for the central dm content , results are still inconclusive , as both lower dm fractions ( @xcite , within the einstein radius ) or larger ones ( @xcite , within @xmath8 ) have been found .",
    "however , the latter studies are based on limited galaxy samples with different model choices ( e.g. on adopted scales at which the dm fractions are derived ) , thus their conclusions are prone to uncertainties which are difficult to keep under control .    instead , homogeneous approaches on well studied high@xmath7 samples are still missing . only recently , using massive galaxies from sdss - iii / boss combined with a sample from sdss - ii , @xcite have addressed the question , providing evidences that high - z etgs are less dm dominated than their local counterparts .",
    "however , further independent analysis are needed , to constrain not only the overall evolution of central dm , but also how it correlates with mass or galaxy size , and how these correlations change as a function of redshift .    the ediscs sample ( @xcite ; @xcite ) includes etgs in a wide range of redshifts ( @xmath9 ) for which accurate photometry , structural parameters and central velocity dispersions are available .",
    "this provides us a rare opportunity to investigate the evolution of the central dm content , comparing these results with inferences in local galaxy samples .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "data samples and the analysis performed are introduced in sect .",
    "[ sec : data ] .",
    "the evolution of the relations between size and velocity dispersion with stellar mass are discussed in sect  [ sec : correlations ] , while sect .",
    "[ sec : evolution ] is devoted to the analysis of central dm content , its evolution with redshift , systematics and the interpretation within the formation scenarios .",
    "conclusions and future prospects are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . we adopt a cosmological model with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a uniform dynamical analysis for galaxies distributed on a wide redshift window . as higher - redshift galaxies we will use the sample from ediscs survey ( @xcite ) , with",
    "covers a redshift window from @xmath12 to @xmath13 . as @xmath14 comparison samples",
    ", we use the data from spider project ( @xcite ) , 3d(@xcite ) and from @xcite . in the following",
    "we will provide further details about data samples adopted .",
    "the ediscs survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) provides photometric and spectroscopic data for etgs in field and rich clusters with @xmath15 and stellar mass completeness limit at @xmath16 .",
    "we limit the analysis to objects with spectroscopic measurements , as these provide us accurate redshifts and internal kinematics .",
    "the final sample which we will use for this analysis has been further selected to have weak @xmath17 $ ] lines in order to remove late - type galaxies and contains 41 field galaxies and 113 in clusters .    for these systems ,",
    "circularized hst i - band effective radii , , and srsic fitting indices , @xmath18 , are available .",
    "the average slit width of the spectral observations , from which velocity dispersion have been derived , has been converted to an equivalent circular aperture of radius @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the slit width , in arcsec .",
    "the ratio between spectral aperture and the effective radius , @xmath21 amounts to @xmath22 , with a tail to higher ratios .    as reference",
    "stellar masses , we have taken the ones from @xcite , using rest - frame absolute photometry derived from sed fitting ( @xcite ) , adopting the calibrations of @xcite , with a `` diet '' salpeter imf and @xmath23 colors .",
    "these masses are re - normalized to a chabrier imf subtracting @xmath24 dex , accordingly to results in @xcite .",
    "our masses are in very good agreement with those in @xcite .      following the analysis in @xcite and @xcite we model the velocity dispersion of each individual galaxy using the spherical isotropic jeans equations and hence estimate the ( total ) dynamical mass  ( which",
    ", hereafter , we will refer to as ) within @xmath25  1  .    in the jeans equations ,",
    "the stellar density is provided by the srsic fit of the photometric data , and the total ( dm + stars ) mass is assumed to have the form of a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , from which @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the model ( 3d ) velocity dispersion .",
    "the isothermal profile has been found to provide a robust description of the mass distribution in massive etgs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and in particular the massive dark halos dominating the outer regions of galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this `` conspiracy '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) seems to be motivated also by theoretical arguments as the stellar body and dark halos can produce an overall isothermal profile after having gone through the processes of gas contraction and star formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for further details on the systematics introduced by the particular model choice , one can refer to @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , in sect .",
    "[ sec : systematics ] we will discuss the impact on our results of the slope of the galaxy model adopted .",
    "we use three local data - sets of etgs to compare with high@xmath7 results . for these samples",
    "we have performed the same dynamical analysis and use similar assumptions for the stellar and total density profiles as the ones for the high@xmath7 sample discussed in sect .",

    "the data - set includes optical@xmath31near - infrared photometry [ from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the ukirt infrared deep sky survey - large area survey ] , high - quality measurements of galactic structural parameters ( effective radius  and srsic index @xmath18 ) , and sdss central - aperture velocity dispersions @xmath32 .",
    "the sample galaxies are defined as bulge dominated systems with passive spectra while late - type systems are removed through the sdss classification parameters based on the spectral type and the fraction of light which is better described by a @xcite profile ( see t+12 for further details ) .",
    "the sample is @xmath33 complete at the stellar mass @xmath34 , which corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "the sps - based stellar mass - to - light ratios , , were derived by fitting @xcite models to the multi - band photometry , assuming a chabrier imf ( see @xcite and @xcite for further details ) .",

    "_ this sample is originally constituted of 260 etgs from the 3d  survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "about 15% of the sample have significant gradients of the stellar mass - to - light ratio , as inferred by their young stellar populations ( h@xmath41 equivalent width greater than 2.3   ) .",
    "we exclude these systems and retain a sample of 224 galaxies .",
    "the relevant data for each galaxy include the effective radius ,  ( obtained by renormalizing their from mge light profiles with a factor of 1.35 ) , the projected stellar velocity dispersion , , within a circularized aperture of radius , the @xmath42-band total luminosity @xmath43 and stellar  ( @xmath44 ) derived by sps fitting of the spectra with @xcite models and a @xcite imf .",
    "the @xcite imf yields stellar masses that are @xmath45 dex smaller ( see also @xcite for further details ) .",
    "these three local samples allow us to evaluate the impact on the results of : a ) the prescription for light distribution profiles , b ) the apertures used to measure velocity dispersion and c ) sps prescriptions for stellar mass estimates .",
    "as we will see , the trends are nearly independent of the sample adopted , making the results quite robust .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for simplicity ,",

    "the chance to interact with neighboring galaxies is very high , but for galaxies in the field merging is a less common event .",
    "thus , the only ways to put ediscs field galaxies and local objects within a coherent scenario are : a ) they will fall in the following 7 gyrs within a cluster or a group of galaxies , and merge with other galaxies , b ) they are atypical objects which set out of the median local relations , c ) any other phenomenon is working to puffing up the galaxy size ( as agn feedback ; @xcite ) and consequently the .",
    "we have analyzed the central dm content in a sample of high-@xmath4 ( @xmath9 ) etgs from the ediscs survey , parameterized in this paper through the total - to - stellar mass ratio , , ( calculated at @xmath49 ) , and compared the results with local galaxy samples ( spider , @xcite ; 3d , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that local correlations between  and ,  and  are fairly independent of the sample adopted and almost all conserved at high@xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fdm ] ) .",
    "in fact , high@xmath7 galaxies are more dm dominated at larger  and  ( i.e. they follow a positive correlation ) . for this sample , this is a clear indication that the main driver in the observed positive correlations is the effective radius , consistently with local galaxies as found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a less significant negative correlation is found in terms of stellar mass , in the opposite direction to the correlations of the local galaxies .    as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : size - mass - fdm ] and [ fig : fdm ] , an overall offset of the  from high@xmath50 to low@xmath7 galaxies is evident , suggesting an evolution of the dm fraction within .",
    "in particular , we find that at fixed the ediscs sample presents  of @xmath51 dex smaller than local galaxies .",
    "the change in  is stronger at  and fixed , being @xmath52 dex and @xmath53 dex , respectively . at fixed  a clear variation of the  as a function of",

    "[ fig : size - mass - fdm ] ) , but not in  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : size - sigma - mass_2 ] ) .",
    "the overall evolution of the dm fraction with redshift ( see fig . [",
    "fig : final ] ) is consistent with the results found in @xcite , but in contrast with the opposite trend found by @xcite ( within @xmath8 ) , which find larger dm fractions at high-@xmath4 , and inconsistent with the absence of evolution in @xcite .",
    "our findings are consistent with results in @xcite which , using sdss - iii / boss and sdss - ii datasets , find smaller dm fractions in higher - z galaxies , but the trend with redshift is shallower than ours .",
    "instead , we do not agree with the absence of evolution found in @xcite for a sample of quiescent galaxies at @xmath54 .",
    "we find that , on average , the inferred  from a salpeter imf ( or bottom - heavier imfs in general ) are disfavored with respect to a chabrier imf , mainly at high redshift and in low-  systems .",
    "thus , we can reproduce our  assuming a chabrier / salpeter imf at high / low redshift , which would point to an imf evolution with redshift .",
    "this result seems to be in contrast with the recent findings in @xcite , which find a salpeter imf in @xmath55 massive galaxies .",
    "however , their models assume a constant-  profile , and no - dm content in the central regions ( i.e. the mass is only in stars ) which might have biased the overall stellar  as their dynamical  and the inferred  are just upper limits ( @xcite )",
    ". furthermore their sample is composed by very massive ( @xmath56 ) galaxies with very high-@xmath57 ( most of the systems have @xmath58 ) .",
    "taking all these specifics of their sample , their results are substantially consistent with ours , since a salpeter imf is allowed by the ediscs systems at similar velocity dispersions , providing nearly null dm fractions consistent with their assumption ( see bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdm ] )    we have briefly discussed the possibility that the imf is non - universal , not only as a function of redshift , but that it can also vary with the mass / central velocity dispersion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the impact on our results of a more realistic imf variation with  from local observations ( @xcite ) has been analyzed , and assumed to be valid and the same at all redshifts .",
    "this has been shown to produce a smaller number of negative dm fraction with respect to a salpeter imf .",
    "however , a combined evolution with mass/  and redshift would completely solve the issue of negative .",
    "although most of stars are already in place at @xmath59 , a change of imf across the time could be produced by two different processes : a ) new stars formed in the core during a wet merging process , which also produce positive age gradients ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and `` higher - mass '' imf ( @xcite ) in young and massive local etgs , or b ) by stars from both merging galaxies characterized by two different imfs , which can combine to modify the cumulative imf of the remnant .",
    "unfortunately , the net effect of these processes on the final imf is not yet clear and in most cases the combination of a `` higher- '' and a `` lower - mass '' imf would produce a final diluted imf . therefore , it is also plausible to scan alternative mass modelling and mechanisms to explain the negative  at high@xmath4 and in low-  etgs , as i ) adopting realistic and viable dm halo profiles , ii ) the effect of some dissipative processes that might alter the standard dm distribution like the adiabatic contraction ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or iii ) some other dm flavor ( e.g. , some warm dm , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of the imf and dm halo evolution across the time is beyond the scopes of this paper and will be addressed in future , assuming more complex mass modelling ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . from the theoretic point of view , this evolution would pose a further open question : which circumstances might have caused the imf variation across time at any given ? .",
    "this is a new fundamental question which has to be added to the imf evidences of non - universality ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have finally investigated our results with a fixed imf within galaxy formation scenarios and found that simple passive evolution is not able to reproduce local results . on the contrary ,",
    "the galaxy merging scenario allow to reproduce the growth of the and the  with @xmath4 .",
    "we have used toy - models which take into account size and mass accretion from minor- and major - mergings to show that a single major merger is not able to reproduce local correlations , while many minor mergers work better ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    of course , in order to have a firmer assessment on the actual dm content evolution with redshift , much larger samples are needed , with full spectroscopic and photometric information . in particular , gravitational lensing can provide us very robust mass estimates ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , survey projects like slacs or cosmos ( e.g. @xcite ) or the ongoing eso public surveys with vst telescope ( such as kids ) together with spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. , boss / sdss , @xcite and gama , @xcite ) are fundamental to collect a large sample of galaxies , that span a wide range of luminosity and redshifts , in order to probe more massive galaxies in the universe and their evolutive history , by means of the description of the different history of stellar and dm and their interplay in the inner and outer regions of galaxies .",
