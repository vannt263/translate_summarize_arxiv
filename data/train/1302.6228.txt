    "a large fraction of massive stars reside in binary systems , with recent estimates of binarity for o - type stars of @xmath3 @xcite . in such systems , which consist of two hot luminous massive stars",
    ", the collision of the powerful stellar winds leads to the formation of high mach number shocks that emit at x - ray wavelengths @xcite .",
    "historically , colliding winds binary ( cwb ) systems have been characterized by high plasma temperatures and an x - ray over - luminosity ( compared to their expected single star brightness ) @xcite with observational inferences corroborated by theoretical models @xcite .",
    "however , more recent studies examining a wider population and using the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ satellites indicate that short period wr+o and o+o - star binary systems have a ratio of @xmath4 , similar to that expected for single o - stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , superlative x - ray brightness - @xmath5 as high as -5 - appears to be reserved for the more massive cwbs with high mass - loss rates ( e.g. wr25 - @xcite  @xcite , @xcite  @xcite ; wr140 - @xcite  @xcite ; @xmath6carinae - @xcite  @xcite , @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "c +    can current models of cwbs account for the observed spread of over three orders of magnitude in x - ray luminosity from cwbs @xcite ? specific studies of archetypal systems around the higher luminosity end of the distribution have yielded promising results .",
    "for example , three dimensional simulations of @xmath6carinae and wr140 , which include orbital motion , radiative cooling , and in some cases radiative driving , are able to explain the x - ray lightcurves and spectra reasonably well @xcite .",
    "in contrast , models of wr22 by @xcite over - predict  by up to two orders of magnitude , with the best agreement ( a factor of roughly six over - estimate ) achieved when a wind - photosphere collision occurs and the majority of the x - ray emission is extinguished . problems also arise for lower mass cwb systems . a model of an o6v+o6v binary by @xcite and @xcite revealed an estimated @xmath5 of between -6 and -6.3 ( depending on the viewing angle ) .",
    "this should be compared against observed values for systems with orbital periods of 2 - 3 days that have @xmath7 between -6.2 and -7.3 @xcite . @xcite",
    "have presented evidence that this discrepancy may , in part , be due to the spectral fitting procedure used to extract parameters from observations , which they show to under - predict the actual x - ray luminosity ( which is known from the models ) by up to a factor of two , particularly for short period systems where occultation may occur .",
    "alternatively , the inconsistency with observations may indicate that some additional physics is required in the models .",
    "consideration of radiative wind driving in a massive star binary system led to the discovery of two interesting effects : radiative inhibition @xcite and sudden radiative braking @xcite . in the former",
    ", the acceleration of the stellar wind may be reduced by the radiation field of the binary companion , whereas the latter effect concerns hypersonic flows being effectively halted in their tracks enabling a wind - wind collision in systems where one would not occur on the basis of a ram pressure balance alone .",
    "one factor that has not been previously studied in the cwb paradigm is the influence of the ionizing x - rays from the wind - wind collision shocks on the wind driving .",
    "@xcite examined the dependence of the radiative line force on x - ray ionization for the case of a high - mass x - ray binary system , finding that the stellar wind acceleration could be significantly suppressed by a particularly bright compact object because the excessive x - ray ionization reduces the radiative line force ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this effect has also been explored for line - driven instability shocks embedded in a massive star s wind @xcite and for radiatively driven disk winds of active galactic nuclei @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we make the first attempt to examine the feedback of ionizing x - rays from the wind - wind collision shocks on wind acceleration in a massive star binary system . because of the direct coupling between the radiation force that drives the stellar winds and the ionizing x - ray emission that results from the wind - wind collision , we term this effect _ self regulated shocks _ ( srss ) .",
    "[ fig : srs_cartoon ] depicts the basic scenario under consideration and highlights some key effects due to srss .",
    "firstly , wind velocities are reduced ( shorter arrows in the right panel ) which causes a lower post - shock plasma temperature ( fainter shading ) .",
    "consequently , radiative cooling may become sufficiently important to introduce instabilities which will perturb the shock fronts @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to provide a qualitative picture , and initial quantitative estimates , of when / if the srs effect might be important .",
    "therefore , we will make simplifications in order to elucidate the physics .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in   [ sec : line_force ] we calculate the influence of x - ray ionization on the line force due to an ensemble of spectral lines .",
    "the semi - analytical wind acceleration model is described in   [ sec : model ] , followed by results for model binary systems in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "an approximate model for srss is presented in   [ sec : approx ] .",
    "we compare results to observations in ",
    "[ sec : obs_compare ] and then discuss some implications of our findings , and possible avenues for going beyond the illustrative wind acceleration model adopted in this work , in   [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are summarised in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "for the wind models that will be presented in   [ sec : model ] , we need to compute the radiation force due to spectral lines for appropriate stellar parameters while accounting for the influence of x - ray irradiation arising from a wind collision",
    ". we will adopt an approximate treatment of the radiation force due to spectral lines following @xcite ( hereafter @xcite ) and closely follow the approach by @xcite to estimate the effect of x - ray ionization on the line force  essentially , our goal is to repeat their calculations for the stellar parameters appropriate to our study . in this section",
    "we outline the method and the implementation used here . for full details of the methodology and discussions of its validity",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    the total force due to lines is given by , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electron scattering opacity and @xmath10 is the radiative flux .",
    "@xmath11 is known as the line force multiplier , which depends on the dimensionless optical depth parameter in a stellar wind , defined by      where @xmath13 is the mass density , @xmath14 is the thermal velocity of a hydrogen atom and @xmath15 is the radial velocity gradient . the sobolev optical depth of a spectral line between lower state @xmath16 and upper state @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where      here , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the lower and upper level population number densities and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the usual einstein coefficients for absorption and stimulated emission , respectively . the force multiplier , @xmath11 , is composed from a sum over all line transitions        to evaluate @xmath11 , we need to supply a list of line transitions ( frequencies and oscillator strengths ) , specify the form of the radiation field @xmath26 , and compute the associated level populations ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , relative to the total density @xmath13 ) .",
    "the line list used in this study is drawn from two sources .",
    "for low - ionization metal atoms / ions , we use the cd23 line database of @xcite . from this source we include elements with atomic number @xmath28 and include ionization stages i  v with the following exceptions : for c , we include only i  iv while for @xmath29 we include ions i  vii , where available . in order to extend our calculations to regimes of higher ionization",
    ", we also included data from the chianti atomic database @xcite . from this source ,",
    "we take line lists for h and he and the high ions of the astrophysically abundance metals : c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe and ni ( for each of these metal , we include chianti line lists for all available ions that we did not take from kurucz & bell 1995 ; we excluded theoretically predicted lines from the database ) . in total ,",
    "our line list contains @xmath30 transitions .",
    "the level populations ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) for each transition were computed in a two stage process .",
    "first we used cloudy v10.00 @xcite to compute the ionization stage of a shell of gas illuminated by a specified radiation field . in all cases , we assumed that the irradiating spectrum contains two components : emission from the star and hard radiation associated with emission from the wind collision region .",
    "the shape of the stellar component was taken from the same model atmospheres used for @xmath31 . in setting the intensity of this component ,",
    "we follow @xcite and consider only a single value for the ratio of the electron number density to the geometrical dilution factor ( @xmath32  @xmath33 ) . to describe the spectral shape of the hard ionizing radiation , we adopt a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum at a temperature of 10  kev . the intensity of this component is specified as an ionization parameter , @xmath34 where , in this work , @xmath35 is the flux of x - rays from the wind collision shocks , and @xmath13 is the gas density . the value of @xmath36 is varied to quantify the affect of x - ray ionization on @xmath11 . from the ion populations provided by the cloudy calculations , we compute level populations assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte , adopting the gas temperature calculated by cloudy ) .",
    "although simplistic , this assumption makes it easy to compute the force multiplier reasonably quickly . ideally , full non - lte calculations should be performed for complete atomic models associated with each ion .",
    "this , however , would significantly complicate the calculation and is not expected to qualitatively affect our findings ( see * ? ? ? * for further discussion ) .",
    "using the procedure outlined above , we can calculate @xmath11 accounting for the effects of excess ionization ( as controlled by @xmath36 ) .",
    "as an example , we show results for a star with effective temperature @xmath37  k , surface gravity @xmath38 and solar metallicity @xmath39 in fig .  [",
    "fig : mplot ] .",
    "as expected , our results are in good agreement with @xcite . for each value of @xmath36",
    ", @xmath40 is largest ( and constant ) when @xmath41 is sufficiently small that all lines are optically thin . at large @xmath41",
    ", @xmath40 decreases as lines become optically thick and saturate . for calculations with low ionization parameter ( @xmath42 ) ,",
    "@xmath40 remains significant ( @xmath43 ) up to around @xmath44 ( @xmath40 is essentially independent of ionization parameter for @xmath45 ) .",
    "as found by @xcite , we also see that as @xmath46 is increased beyond zero , @xmath40 drops and the regime in which @xmath11 is well - described by the optically thin limit extends to higher @xmath41-values . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the force multiplier is always small .    for comparison",
    ", we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mplot ] the @xmath40-values reported by @xcite from calculations for a star with similar parameters ( @xmath48  k , @xmath49 and @xmath50  @xmath33 ) . since no excess ionization radiation was included by @xcite , his calculations should be compared to our results for the lowest ionization parameter shown ( @xmath51 ) . in general , the agreement is very good  the biggest discrepancy occurs around @xmath52 and is at worst a factor of two .      although the force multiplier @xmath40 can be directly used to specify the line force , it is convenient to parametrize its dependence on @xmath41 for use in wind calculations .",
    "although this approach means that the full complexity of @xmath11 is not captured , it is widely used because of the relative ease of manipulating simply - parametrized forms for @xmath11 when deriving wind solutions .",
    "the basic ansatz under the @xcite approximation is to fit a power - law to the run of @xmath11 with @xmath41 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 defines the slope and @xmath55 the amplitude of @xmath40 at @xmath56 ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) . to capture the flattening of @xmath11 for small @xmath41 ,",
    "we follow @xcite , and modify eq  ( [ eqn : basicmt ] ) such that the force multiplier becomes constant at low @xmath41 ( as it must in the optically thin limit ) , @xmath58 \\label{eqn : mtxi}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 . in eq  ( [ eqn : mtxi ] ) we now explicitly indicate that @xmath40 depends on both @xmath41 and @xmath36 . throughout this paper",
    ", we will choose to describe the influence of @xmath36 on @xmath40 via the cak parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "allowing for @xmath36-dependence in these quantities captures the two systematic changes in @xmath62 with @xmath36 : decreasing @xmath61 with increasing @xmath36 allows the turnover in @xmath11 to shift to higher @xmath41 with increasing @xmath36 , while a reduction in @xmath60 at large @xmath36 describes the overall decrease in @xmath40 for larger ionization parameters .",
    "we follow @xcite in _ choosing _ that @xmath54 does not vary with @xmath36 .",
    "although it is certainly possible to allow @xmath54 to vary , this mostly just adds unwarranted complexity to the parametrization . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : mplot ] , the slope of @xmath63 versus @xmath64 is not constant , meaning that a best - fit @xmath54 is in any case a function of the range across which it is fit .",
    "therefore , in all of our calculations , we do not fit @xmath54 but rather fix it to the value that is required in order to reproduce the correct observed terminal velocity for a single star of the appropriate spectral type in a standard cak theory , but to a much lesser extent than @xmath54 , as one would expect from the functional form of @xmath11 . ] .",
    "for the example star discussed in section  [ sect : example_m ] , this is @xmath65 .    with @xmath54 fixed , we derive values of @xmath60 and @xmath66 by fitting our computed @xmath11 curves to the functional form given by eq  ( [ eqn : mtxi ] ) .",
    "we restrict this fitting to @xmath67 , the regime in which @xmath11 is expected to be dynamically significant . to illustrate the accuracy of this approach , the derived fits from our example calculation are over - plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mplot ] .",
    "as expected , the fits are always very good in the optically thin limit and generally agree to within a few tens of per cent across the range of interest ( i.e. when @xmath68 )",
    ". however , there are clear imperfections , particularly in cases where the slope of @xmath11 deviates from a constant power law ( e.g. in our @xmath69 case ) .",
    "nevertheless , the parametrized form provides a convenient description and reproduces the force multiplier to within a factor of two , which is adequate precision for the purpose of this investigation .",
    "we provide tabulated values of @xmath60 and @xmath66 in the appendix .      as mentioned in the previous section , in fitting @xmath60 and @xmath61 we specified the value of @xmath54 _ a priori _ with the aim that the resulting @xmath70 produced a terminal wind velocity in agreement with observed values",
    "we now also rescale the force multiplier @xmath70 to produce a wind _ mass - loss rate _ in agreement with observed values , which equates to multiplying @xmath60 by a correction factor . at the cost of some subjective rescaling",
    ", this approach has the advantage of ensuring that the line force used in the colliding - winds model in the following section will produce sensible wind parameters while also allowing the influence of x - ray irradiation to be explored .",
    "we note that this modification is of smaller magnitude than the current uncertainties in mass - loss rates and wind acceleration in massive stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "line force calculations were performed for two massive stars : o6v and o4iii ( see table  [ tab : stellar_models ] for full sets of stellar parameters ) . in fig .  [",
    "fig : k_etamax ] we show the resulting @xmath60 and @xmath61 . clearly , for @xmath71 the line force is effectively suppressed , whereas for @xmath72 ionization effects are negligible and radiative acceleration is largely unaffected ."
