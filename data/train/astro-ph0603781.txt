    "high - energy neutrino telescopes are going to open a new window on the universe , since they can be used to probe and characterize very distant astrophysical sources @xcite .",
    "the promising icecube neutrino telescope @xcite , which has a kilometer - scale detector , is now under construction .",
    "if the relative fluxes of ultrahigh - energy @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) neutrinos are successfully measured at icecube and other neutrino telescopes , it will be possible to diagnose the relevant cosmic accelerators ( e.g. , their locations and characteristics ) and examine the properties of neutrinos themselves ( e.g. , neutrino mixing and leptonic cp violation ) .    indeed , robust evidence for neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing has been achieved from the recent solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments . due to neutrino oscillations , the neutrino fluxes observed at the detector @xmath9 are in general different from the source fluxes @xmath10 .",
    "note that our notation is @xmath11 ( for @xmath12 ) , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the @xmath15-neutrino and @xmath16-antineutrino fluxes , respectively .",
    "the relation between @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) is given by @xmath21 in which @xmath22 and @xmath23 stand respectively for the oscillation probabilities @xmath24 and @xmath25 . as the galactic distances far exceed the observed neutrino oscillation lengths , @xmath22 and @xmath26",
    "are actually averaged over many oscillations and take a very simple form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( for @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) are just the elements of the @xmath32 neutrino mixing matrix @xmath33 .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) lead us to a straightforward relation between @xmath34 and @xmath35 : @xmath36 this relation indicates that the observation of @xmath37 at a neutrino telescope can _ at least _ help    * to determine or constrain the flavor composition of cosmic neutrino fluxes @xcite , if three neutrino mixing angles and the dirac cp - violating phase hidden in @xmath22 have been measured to a good degree of accuracy ( e.g. , a precision of @xmath38 or smaller relative error bars @xcite ) ;    or    * to determine or constrain one or two of three neutrino mixing angles and the dirac cp - violating phase @xcite , provided the production mechanism of ultrahigh - energy neutrinos at an astrophysical source ( e.g. , the conventional source to be mentioned below ) is really understood .    hence neutrino telescopes will serve as a very useful tool to probe both the high - energy astrophysical processes and the intrinsic properties of massive neutrinos .",
    "this paper aims at a determination of the flavor composition of cosmic neutrino fluxes at the source with the help of neutrino telescopes .",
    "different from the previous works ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , our present study starts from a generic parametrization of the initial neutrino fluxes : @xmath39 where @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] , and @xmath42 denotes the total flux ( i.e. , the sum of three neutrino fluxes )",
    ". provided ultrahigh - energy neutrinos are produced by certain astrophysical sources ( e.g. , active galactic nuclei or agn ) via the decay of pions created from @xmath43 and @xmath44 collisions , for instance , their flavor content is expected to be @xmath45 this  standard \" neutrino flux ratio corresponds to @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( or equivalently @xmath48 ) in our parametrization .",
    "it turns out that any small departure of @xmath2 from zero will measure the existence of cosmic @xmath3 and @xmath4 neutrinos , which might come from the decays of @xmath49 and @xmath50 mesons produced at the source @xcite . on the other hand , any small deviation of @xmath51 from @xmath52",
    "will imply that the conventional mechanism for ultrahigh - energy neutrino production from the agn has to be modified .",
    "similar arguments can be put forward for the neutrino fluxes from some other astrophysical sources , such as the postulated neutron beam source @xcite with @xmath53 ( or equivalently @xmath54 ) and the possible muon - damped source @xcite with @xmath55 ( or equivalently @xmath56 ) .",
    "therefore , we are well motivated to investigate how the _ true _ values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for a specific astrophysical source can be determined or constrained by use of the second - generation neutrino telescopes and with the help of more precise data from the upcoming long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments . this goal is indeed reachable , as we shall explicitly demonstrate in the remaining part of this paper .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derive the analytical relations between the neutrino flavor parameters ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) at an astrophysical source and the typical observables of neutrino fluxes at a terrestrial detector .",
    "section iii is devoted to a detailed numerical analysis of the dependence of those observables on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "a brief summary of our main results is given in section iv .",
    "because of neutrino oscillations and the @xmath3  regeneration \" in the earth @xcite , it is especially important to detect all three flavors of the cosmic neutrinos at a neutrino telescope .",
    "the sum of @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 is equal to that of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 as one may easily see from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "a measurement of @xmath42 may involve large systematic uncertainties , but the latter can be largely cancelled out in the ratio of two neutrino fluxes .",
    "therefore , let us follow ref .",
    "@xcite to define @xmath64 as our _ working _ observables .",
    "we remark that these ratios are largely free from the systematic uncertainties associated with the measurements of @xmath57 , @xmath65 and @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , it is relatively easy to extract @xmath66 from the ratio of muon tracks to showers at icecube @xcite , even if those electron and tau events may not well be disentangled . since @xmath67 , @xmath66 and @xmath68",
    "satisfy @xmath69 only two of them are independent .    note that eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) represent two peculiar ( non - standard ) scenarios of cosmic neutrino production . in principle",
    ", one may also assume an exotic astrophysical source which only produces @xmath3 and @xmath4 neutrinos ; i.e. , @xmath70 or equivalently @xmath71 with unspecified @xmath1 in our parametrization .",
    "the expression of @xmath72 ( for @xmath73 ) can then be simplified in such special cases : @xmath74 even if the third case is completely unrealistic , it could serve as an example to illustrate the salient feature of @xmath72 defined above .    without loss of generality",
    ", we choose @xmath67 and @xmath66 as two typical observables and derive their explicit relations with @xmath1 and @xmath2 . by using eqs .",
    "( 4 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) , we obtain @xmath75 } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ r^{}_\\mu & = & \\frac{p^{}_{e \\mu } \\sin^2\\xi + p^{}_{\\mu \\mu } \\cos^2\\xi + p^{}_{\\tau \\mu } \\tan^2\\zeta}{\\sec^2\\zeta - \\left [ p^{}_{e \\mu } \\sin^2\\xi + p^{}_{\\mu \\mu }",
    "\\cos^2\\xi + p^{}_{\\tau \\mu } \\tan^2\\zeta \\right ] } \\ ; .",
    "%        ( 12)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the source flavor parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 can then be figured out in terms of @xmath67 and @xmath66 : @xmath76 where the notations @xmath77 and @xmath78 have been used to simplify the expressions .",
    "indeed , @xmath79 and @xmath80 hold .",
    "one may in principle choose either @xmath81 or @xmath82 as a set of working observables to inversely determine @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the first set has been chosen by a few authors ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and will also be adopted in this paper .",
    "note that the averaged neutrino oscillation probabilities @xmath22 depend on three mixing angles @xmath83 and the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath84 in the standard parametrization of the @xmath32 neutrino mixing matrix @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "taking account of @xmath85 @xcite but @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xcite , we express @xmath22 as the first - order expansion of the small parameter @xmath88 : @xmath89 in which the higher - order terms , such as @xmath90 , have been safely neglected .",
    "one can see that the sensitivity of @xmath22 to @xmath91 is suppressed due to the smallness of @xmath88 .",
    "hence the dependence of @xmath92 on @xmath91 is expected to be insignificant .",
    "in addition , it is hard to distinguish between the cases of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , because it is the product of @xmath88 and @xmath95 that appears in the analytical approximations of @xmath96 .    a global analysis of current neutrino oscillation data @xcite yields @xmath97 at the @xmath98 confidence level .",
    "the best - fit values of three neutrino mixing angles are @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath99 @xcite , but the cp - violating phase @xmath91 is entirely unrestricted .",
    "although the present experimental data remain unsatisfactory , they can be used to constrain the correlation between the parameters @xmath100 and the observables @xmath101 .",
    "we shall illustrate our analytical results by taking a few typical numerical examples in the subsequent section .",
    "first of all , let us follow a rather conservative strategy to scan the reasonable ranges of @xmath102 and @xmath100 so as to examine the sensitivities of @xmath103 to these six parameters .",
    "we take @xmath104 $ ] in addition to the generous intervals of three mixing angles given in eq .",
    "( 15 ) , and allow @xmath1 to vary in the region @xmath105 $ ] . as the amount of @xmath3 and @xmath4 neutrinos produced at those realistic astrophysical sources is expected to be very small or even vanishing , we restrict the parameter @xmath2 to a very narrow domain @xmath106 $ ] , which corresponds to @xmath107 @xcite . it should be noted that we do the numerical computation by using the exact expressions of @xmath108 instead of eq .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "two comments are in order :    1 .",
    "the source parameter @xmath1 is quite sensitive to the values of the neutrino flux ratios @xmath72 ( for @xmath73 ) .",
    "even if three neutrino mixing angles involve a lot of uncertainties and the dirac cp - violating phase is entirely unknown , a combined measurement of @xmath81 or @xmath109 can constrain the value of @xmath1 to an acceptable degree of accuracy .",
    "this encouraging observation assures that the second - generation neutrino telescopes can really be used to probe the initial flavor composition of ultrahigh neutrino fluxes .",
    "note that the standard pion - decay source @xmath110 will produce @xmath111 or equivalently @xmath112 at the detector , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , if @xmath113 is fixed and @xmath85 is taken . such an expectation can not be true , however , when @xmath1 deviates from its given value @xmath114 and ( or ) when @xmath115 departs from its best - fit value @xmath116 .",
    "more precise neutrino oscillation data will greatly help to narrow down the @xmath117 parameter space .",
    "2 .   in contrast",
    ", the source parameter @xmath2 seems to be insensitive to @xmath72 ( for @xmath12 ) .",
    "the reason for this insensitivity is two - fold : ( a ) the values of @xmath2 have been restricted to a very narrow range ( @xmath118 ) ; and ( b ) the numerical uncertainties of three neutrino mixing angles and the dirac cp - violating phase are too large .",
    "provided @xmath119 , @xmath115 , @xmath120 and @xmath91 are all measured to a high degree of accuracy in the near future , it will be possible to find out the definite dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath2 for a given value of @xmath1 .    to be more explicit",
    ", we are going to consider three typical scenarios of cosmic neutrino fluxes and illustrate the sensitivities of @xmath67 , @xmath66 and @xmath68 to the source parameters @xmath100 and to the unknown neutrino mixing parameters @xmath121 .",
    "we argue that the simple flavor content of ultrahigh - energy neutrino fluxes from the standard pion - decay source could somehow be contaminated for certain reasons : e.g. , a small amount of @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath3 and their antiparticles might come from the decays of heavier hadrons produced by @xmath43 and @xmath44 collisions @xcite .",
    "similar arguments can also be made for the postulated neutron beam source and the possible muon - damped source , as our present knowledge about the mechanism of cosmic neutrino production remains very poor . following a phenomenological approach",
    ", we slightly modify the scenarios listed in eqs .",
    "( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) by allowing the relevant @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters to fluctuate around their given values .",
    "namely , we consider    * * scenario a : * @xmath122 and @xmath123 , serving as a modified version of the standard pion - decay source ( originally , @xmath114 and @xmath124 ) ; * * scenario b : * @xmath125 and @xmath123 , serving as a modified version of the postulated neutron beam source ( originally , @xmath126 and @xmath124 ) ; * * scenario c : * @xmath127 and @xmath123 , serving as a modified version of the possible muon - damped source ( originally , @xmath128 and @xmath124 ) .    for simplicity ,",
    "we fix @xmath129 and @xmath130 in our numerical analysis .",
    "we take four typical inputs for the unknown parameters @xmath120 and @xmath91 : ( a ) @xmath93 ( in this case , @xmath91 is not well - defined and has no physical significance ) ; ( b ) @xmath131 and @xmath132 ; ( c ) @xmath131 and @xmath133 ; and ( d ) @xmath131 and @xmath134 . our numerical results for the sensitivities of @xmath67 , @xmath66 and @xmath68 to @xmath1 and @xmath2 in scenarios a",
    ", b and c are shown in figs .",
    "2 , 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "some discussions are in order .    1 .   .",
    "the neutrino flux ratios @xmath67 , @xmath66 and @xmath68 are all sensitive to the small deviation of @xmath1 from its standard value @xmath135 .",
    "in contrast , the changes of three observables are very small when @xmath2 varies from @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "this insensitivity is understandable : about half of the initial @xmath7 and @xmath8 neutrinos oscillate into @xmath3 and @xmath4 neutrinos , whose amount dominates over the survival amount of initial @xmath3 and @xmath4 neutrinos at the detector . in other words ,",
    "@xmath138 and @xmath139 hold , implying that @xmath72 must be insensitive to small @xmath62 or equivalently to small @xmath2 .",
    "it is therefore difficult to pin down the value of @xmath2 from this kind of astrophysical sources .",
    "as pointed out in the last section , the result of @xmath72 in the @xmath93 case ( solid curves ) is almost indistinguishable from that in the @xmath133 case ( dotted curves ) .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath72 to @xmath91 is insignificant but distinguishable , if the value of @xmath120 is about @xmath140 or larger .",
    "the neutrino flux ratio @xmath67 is sensitive to the small departures of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from their given values @xmath141 and @xmath124 .",
    "this salient feature can be understood as follows . since @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) and @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) neutrinos at the detector mainly come from the initial @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) neutrinos via the oscillation",
    ", the sum of @xmath65 and @xmath142 is expected to be smaller than or comparable with the survival @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) flux @xmath143 .",
    "the roles of @xmath60 and @xmath62 are important in @xmath57 and @xmath144 , respectively .",
    "it turns out that @xmath67 depends , in a relatively sensitive way , on @xmath1 through @xmath57 in its numerator and on @xmath2 through @xmath144 in its denominator .",
    "note also that the nearly degenerate results of @xmath67 for @xmath131 and @xmath145 are primarily attributed to the fact that @xmath146 in the numerator of @xmath67 is actually independent of @xmath91 . on the other hand , the discrepancy between @xmath147 and @xmath148 in fig .",
    "3 results from the @xmath149 terms of @xmath22 , which have been neglected in eq .",
    "( 14 ) . in comparison with @xmath67 , the neutrino flux ratios @xmath66 and @xmath68 are not so sensitive to the small changes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . but the measurement of @xmath66 and @xmath68 is as important as that of @xmath67 , in order to determine the flavor composition of ultrahigh - energy neutrino fluxes at such an astrophysical source .",
    "in this case , in which @xmath57 and @xmath59 mainly come from the initial @xmath61 via @xmath150 and @xmath151 oscillations , one can similarly understand the numerical behaviors of @xmath67 , @xmath66 and @xmath68 changing with the small deviation of @xmath1 from its given value @xmath128 . to explain why three observables are almost independent of the fluctuation of @xmath2 , we take @xmath130 and @xmath152 , which guarantee @xmath153 ( for @xmath12 ) to hold in the leading - order approximation",
    ". we can then simplify eq .",
    "( 12 ) in the @xmath154 limit and arrive at the following result : @xmath155 where @xmath2 is completely cancelled out .",
    "therefore , the tiny dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath2 appearing in fig .",
    "4 is just a natural consequence of the @xmath156 or @xmath157 corrections to eq .",
    "( 16 ) .",
    "although the numerical examples taken above can only serve for illustration , they _ do _ give us a ball - park feeling of the correlation between the source parameters @xmath100 and the neutrino mixing parameters @xmath102 via the working observables @xmath158 at a neutrino telescope .",
    "this observation is certainly encouraging and remarkable .",
    "we have proposed a simple parametrization of the initial flavor composition of ultrahigh - energy neutrino fluxes generated from very distant astrophysical sources : @xmath0 . the conventional mechanism and the postulated scenarios for cosmic neutrino production",
    "can all be reproduced by taking the special values of @xmath100 .",
    "of course , such a parametrization is by no means unique .",
    "an alternative , @xmath159 with @xmath160 $ ] and @xmath161 in general , is also simple and useful . for a realistic astrophysical source , it should be more reasonable to take @xmath162 . comparing between eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 17 ) , one can immediately arrive at @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "the @xmath165 and @xmath100 languages are therefore equivalent to each other .    after defining three neutrino flux ratios @xmath72 ( for @xmath12 ) as our working observables at a neutrino telescope , we have shown that the source parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 can in principle be determined by the measurement of two independent @xmath72 and with the help of accurate neutrino oscillation data .",
    "the standard pion - decay source , the postulated neutrino beam source and the possible muon - damped source have been slightly modified to illustrate the sensitivities of @xmath72 to small departures of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from their given values .",
    "we have also examined the dependence of @xmath72 upon the smallest neutrino mixing angle @xmath120 and upon the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath91 .",
    "our numerical examples indicate that it is quite promising to determine or constrain the initial flavor content of ultrahigh - energy neutrino fluxes with the second - generation neutrino telescopes .",
    "how to measure @xmath72 to an acceptable degree of accuracy is certainly a big challenge to icecube and other neutrino telescopes .",
    "a detailed analysis of the feasibility of our idea for a specific neutrino telescope is desirable , but it is beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    "we remark that our present understanding of the production mechanism of cosmic neutrinos needs the observational and experimental support .",
    "we expect that neutrino telescopes may help us to attain this goal in the long run .",
