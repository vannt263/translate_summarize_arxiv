    "we assess the reliability of estimation of electron energy densities from measurements of synchrotron radio emission , quantifying the significant over - estimation of particle energy densities in sbgs due to the common assumption of a pl form for the spectral density of the emitting electrons . in section 2",
    "we show that when all relevant electron energy losses are accounted for , the electron spectral density can obviously deviate significantly from a pl form , as had been quantitatively demonstrated long ago ( e.g , rephaeli 1979 , pohl 1993 ) .",
    "this necessitates re - calculation of the synchrotron and compton emissivities ( section 3 ) .",
    "as we demonstrate in the latter section , normalization of the electron spectrum by comparison with radio measurements has significant consequences also for the predicted compton x - ray and @xmath0-ray spectra .",
    "the revised electron spectra yield significantly different estimates of the electron energy density than those obtained when the standard formula is used , as shown specifically ( section 4 ) for conditions in sb nuclei .",
    "we briefly discuss our results in section 5 .",
    "it is commonly assumed that steady - state energetic particle ( mostly electrons , protons , and helium nuclei ) distributions can be well approximated by a pl form for a range of values @xmath4 $ ] of the lorentz factor , @xmath0 ; for electrons , the spectral density is n_pl ( ) = n_1 ^-q_pl , [ eq : ss_n_e_p ] where @xmath5 is a normalization constant and @xmath6 is the spectral index . since this commonly used form has no temporal dependence , it is implicitly _ assumed _ to be a steady - state distribution .",
    "this is the form used in the derivation of the standard formulae for electron synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and compton spectra .",
    "while this approximate single - index pl form may be sufficiently accurate for some purposes , it could be very inadequate when the relevant electron energy loss processes have different energy dependence .    in a sb nuclear ( sbn ) region intense star formation yields a high sn rate and consequently efficient particle acceleration . a galactic dynamical process",
    ", the sb phase is long , o(@xmath7 ) year , and since energetic electrons and protons sustain significant energy losses in the relatively small gas - rich , magnetically and radiatively intense sbn source region , steady - state is expected .",
    "the theoretically predicted single index pl spectral density in the acceleration region evolves to become a curved steady - state profile as a result of energy loss processes . to determine the steady - state electron spectral density , we assume that the _ initial _ spectrum of primary accelerated electrons is a pl in momentum .",
    "since we are mostly interested in the radiative yields of relativistic electrons with @xmath8 , we express the single - index spectrum in terms of @xmath0 , and write for the injection rate per unit volume ( ) _ i = k_i ^ - q_i , where @xmath9 is a normalization constant .",
    "when an exact description of the electron spectrum is needed ( also ) at low energies , @xmath10 , the exact relation between energy and momentum has to be used , for which the @xmath0 dependence of the injection spectrum is @xmath11 . whereas the dependence of the electron density on @xmath12 can be appreciable ( as discussed below ) , and since typically @xmath13 , the exact value of this upper cutoff is of little significance for relevant values of @xmath14",
    ".    energetic particle propagation out of their source region and throughout interstellar ( is ) space is typically described as a combination of convection and diffusion .",
    "we assume that in the relatively small sbn region spatial density gradients are not significant , so that the particle density is roughly uniform .",
    "while particle escape out of the sbn is essentially a catastrophic loss that would generally be included as a sink term in the kinetic equation describing the spectral distribution , when this term is energy independent its overall impact essentially amounts to an overall constant factor in the expression for the ( steady state ) spectral density .",
    "since in our treatment here the overall normalization of the electron density is set by the measured level of radio emission , this escape term does not have to be explicitly included in the equation for the steady state distribution .",
    "for our purposes here we therefore focus only on the spectral dependence of the steady - state electron density , @xmath15 , which is determined by the energy dependence of the total energy loss rate , @xmath16 . in this case the electron steady - state spectral density is determined by solving the simple kinetic equation - = k_i^-q_i .",
    "the relevant energy loss processes in a magnetized ( h - he ) gas permeated by intense ( ir ) radiation field are ionization , electronic excitation ( or coulomb ) , bremsstrahlung , and synchrotron - compton .",
    "the corresponding energy loss rates for these well - known processes are @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively . in a medium which consists of ionized , neutral , and molecular gas with densities @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively ,",
    "the lower order energy loss of ( a charged energetic particle ) is by exciting plasma oscillations and by ionization .",
    "the expressions for the exact loss rate for electron energies down to the sub - relativistic regime were calculated by gould ( 1972 , 1975 ; see also schlickeiser 2002 ) ; these yield the approximate total rate @xmath23 \\,\\ , s^{-1}\\ , , \\label{eq : coul_loss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 . in the strong shielding limit ,",

    "obviously , the full klein - nishina cross section has to be used at much higher energies ( e.g. , schlickeiser & ruppel 2010 ) . aside from the weak ( logarithmic ) @xmath0 dependence in the expressions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the value of the subscript in each of the three loss rates corresponds to the power of its @xmath0 dependence , with the relative magnitude of each term determined by the gas densities , @xmath26 , and the radiation field . at low energies the coulomb rate dominates , whereas at high energies synchrotron - compton losses",
    "the steady - state spectral electron density is then n ( ) = .",
    "[ eq : n_e_ss ] clearly , the different energy dependence of the loss processes results in a curved steady - state spectral density , with the value of the effective pl index changing from @xmath36 at energies for which coulomb losses begin to dominate over the combined losses by bremsstrahlung and synchrotron - compton , at energies well below 3.010 ^ 3 ( ) ^1/2 ( ) ^-1 , to @xmath37 at higher energies , for which synchrotron - compton losses dominate over the combined coulomb and bremsstrahlung losses . to quantitatively compare the two distributions , and in order to assess the physical implications of using a pl form for the electron spectral density instead of the more realistic steady - state form , we first need to set the relative normalization .",

    "1^_2 = n_1 _ _",
    "1^_2 ^ -(q_pl -1 ) d .",
    "since the electron density is usually deduced from the synchrotron emission , a more observationally based choice is normalization to the measured radio flux . in the next section",
    "we compare results obtained based on these two different normalizations .    in our numerical estimates",
    "we take the theoretically motivated ( and observationally supported ) value of the injection pl index @xmath39 , and the observationally deduced value of @xmath6 .",
    "an estimate of the latter quantity is obtained from the measured pl index of the radio spectrum , typically in the range @xmath40 in the central sb region ( as in the nearby sbgs m82 & ngc253 ; for references to the radio measurements , see rephaeli , arieli , & persic 2010 , and persic & rephaeli 2014 ) . due to the significant ( nonlinear ) dependence of the electron energy density , @xmath41 , on the spectral index , we adopt the lower ( @xmath42 ) end of the measured radio index of @xmath43 , which corresponds to the fiducial value @xmath44 . doing so we ( conservatively ) underestimate the impact on estimation of @xmath41 due to approximating a steady - state spectral density with a pl distribution .",
    "the pl and steady - state spectral densities are shown in figure 1 for typical conditions in the dense and intense sbn environment , with @xmath45 g , a total radiation field energy density which is estimated to be about @xmath46 ( e.g. , porter & strong 2005 ) , or @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the ( present value of the ) cmb energy density . assumed ionized and neutral gas densities are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the spectral densities plotted in figure 1 clearly demonstrate that coulomb losses dominate up to relatively high energies , @xmath52 gev in a sbn .",
    "in fact , this is so not only in the high density , high magnetic field environment of a sbn , but also across the disk of star - forming galaxies for which both the gas density , o(1 ) @xmath53 , and magnetic field , @xmath54 , are ( correspondingly ) lower than in a sbn , so that the ratio @xmath55 is roughly comparable to that in a sbn",

    "note that since the decay of charged pions ( produced in proton - proton interactions ) yields secondary electrons and positrons , which obviously contribute to the total synchrotron and compton emission , the contributions of secondary electrons and positrons are essentially accounted for _ approximately _ by normalizing the electron spectral density to the measured ( i.e. , total emitted ) radio flux . in our estimates of particle energy densities ( in the next section ) this is quantified through the inclusion of the secondary - to - primary ratio , @xmath71 .",
    "since the most relevant range of the measured radio spectrum is @xmath72 ghz , and given that typically galactic radio spectra in the inner disk region are well fit by @xmath73 , the implied pl distribution is characterized by @xmath44 . of particular interest",

    "the different energy dependence of the loss processes results in a curved radio spectrum , with nearly a flat spectrum at very low frequencies to nearly a pl with an asymptotic index @xmath80 at high frequencies , corresponding to emission from high energy electrons whose losses are synchrotron - compton dominated .",
    "as is evident from figure 2 , the overall impact of strong magnetic fields and high coulomb losses on the synchrotron spectrum is a flattening that extends to relatively high frequencies well into the measured ghz range .",
    "clearly , the synchrotron spectra shown in figures 2 & 3 do not include the effect free - free absorption which decreases the emergent emission at very low frequencies ( condon 1982 ) .",
    "absorption is not included here primarily because our treatment is focused on the impact of spectral flattening due to electron energy losses , rather than on detailed modeling ( and parameter extraction ) in specific sbns . in actual spectral fitting to the observed spectrum of a sbn",
    ", free - free absorption has to be modeled and accounted for before the spectral flattening due to particle losses can be determined , as was done by , e.g. , yoast - hull et al .",
    "( 2013 , 2014a , 2014b ) .    clearly ,",
    "when the two distributions are normalized to the same energy density , the spectral emissivity of the pl is lower than that of the steady - state distribution . since the steady - state spectrum was derived by explicitly accounting for electron losses at low energies , the spectral density can be extended down to the gas thermal energy , which is typically o(@xmath81 ) kev . for our selected values of the pl index @xmath44 and source injection spectrum with index @xmath39 , the pl to steady - state energy density ratio reaches a value of @xmath82 at kinetic energy of 511 kev ( @xmath83 ) , and attains its maximal value @xmath84 already at kinetic energies that are still much higher than the thermal gas energy ( @xmath85kev ) . the steeper the radio spectrum , the higher is the energy density ratio , which equals @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 , i.e. , for pl spectral densities with indices @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .    since our treatment here is strictly spectral with no account taken of the spatial variation of the particle density across the galactic disk , extending the above description to the full disk is obviously unrealistic .",
    "however , our main objective here is to assess the impact of just replacing a pl distribution which , after all , is commonly assumed in characterizing particle spectra in galaxies , we carry out a similar calculation also for the full galactic disk .",
    "we realize , of course , that this is at best only a rough approximation of the more realistic description which necessarily involves a solution of a spectro - spatial kinetic equation . repeating then the calculation with @xmath91 g , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , which are typical mean values across the disk of a star - forming galaxy , and assuming a typical best - fit radio spectrum with @xmath94 ( i.e. , @xmath95 )",
    ", we obtain a value of @xmath96 for the energy density ratio .",
    "the above large values of the energy density ratio reflect the fact that most of the energy density of the pl population is in lower energy electrons .",
    "therefore , when the measured spectrum is fit by a pl , the density normalization is strongly weighted by the emissivity in the measured spectral range , and consequently the deduced energy density is much higher than that of the ( curved ) steady - state spectrum .",
    "normalizing the electron spectral density by the measured radio spectrum allows a direct prediction of the electron spectral compton luminosity .",
    "of particular interest is a comparison of the predicted x - ray and @xmath0-ray spectral luminosity of a pl distribution in a sbn to that of a steady - state distribution .",
    "integrations of the spectral compton emissivity of an electron scattering off a diluted planckian radiation field ( in the thomson limit ; see , e.g. , eq . 2.42 in blumenthal & gould 1970 ) over the electron pl and steady - state distributions , yield the spectra shown in fig .",
    "3 . the distributions were normalized to the same spectral radio luminosity at 5 ghz , fiducially set to the measured flux from the sbn region of ngc253 at a distance of 3 mpc .",
    "comparison of the synchrotron and compton spectra in figures 3 & 4 demonstrates an important consequence of the observationally - based normalization of a steady - state electron distribution : the compton yield of this distribution is significantly higher than that of the pl distribution that is normalized to the same radio flux .",
    "as is obvious from the latter figure , the spectral luminosity in the hard x - ray ( @xmath97 kev ) and @xmath0-ray is more than a factor @xmath98 higher than that of the pl distribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that the electron spectrum is flatter at ( a mean ) energy @xmath99 , for which the compton boost of the incident ir photon energy , @xmath29 , yields an outgoing photon energy @xmath100 kev .",
    "in most cases of interest radio synchrotron measurements are analyzed for the purpose of determining energetic electron properties , such as density and energy density , and the mean strength of the magnetic field in the emitting region .",
    "as argued above , the common assumption of a pl distribution which is fit to the radio data can lead to very inaccurate values for these densities .",
    "such estimates are also quite meaningless since in most cases the contribution of low energy particles is altogether ignored : for typical electron pl indices @xmath101 , the fractional energy density at low energies ( but still relativistic ) below 1 gev is @xmath102 , without even accounting for ( sub - relativistic ) supra - thermal electrons . moreover , in many applications energy equipartition is assumed in order to determine the value of the mean magnetic field ; for this purpose the proton energy density needs to be estimated .",
    "this is usually determined by adopting a theoretical relation for the proton - to - electron number density or energy density ratio .",
    "therefore , overestimation of the electron energy density leads to overestimation also of the proton energy density and the field strength .    quantifying the impact of the more realistic estimate of the electron energy density on estimates of the latter quantities necessitates a revised formulation of the common assumption of energy equipartition between energetic particles and magnetic fields : since a state of equipartition is reached after a sufficiently long period of tight coupling between these nonthermal quantities , the asymptotic relation between their respective energy densities should be based on their steady - state distributions .",
    "self - consistent calculation of these distributions ( e.g. , rephaeli & silk 1995 , lacki & beck 2013 ) requires accounting for all energy loss processes of both electrons and protons , and for a description of the distributions across the full disk , also of their propagation modes .",
    "the quantitative description of such a more physically based equipartition state is outside the scope of our work here . as a first step towards this goal",
    "we describe here an approximate procedure that is based on the use ( also ) of a steady - state spectral density for the protons .",
    "the relevant proton energy loss processes in ionized and neutral gas are coulomb ( i.e. , electronic excitations and ionization ) , and pion production in proton - proton interactions .",
    "the respective loss rates , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , can be expressed by the simplified formulae ( adopted from mannheim & schlickeiser 1994 ) @xmath105   ~ { \\rm s}^{-1}\\ , , \\label{eq : ion_loss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath106 , and the temperature - dependent factor @xmath107 . the loss rate due to pion production is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a step function , and @xmath110 corresponds to the threshold kinetic energy for pion production , @xmath111gev . at low energies electronic excitations is the only loss process , whereas at energies above @xmath111gev losses are mostly due to pion production .",
    "an example for this spectral change is the drop in the local galactic proton spectrum at low energies recently measured by the voyager i spacecraft ( stone 2013 ) ; as argued by schlickeiser ( 2014 ) this is due to coulomb losses .",
    "the proton injection spectrum is assumed to be pl in momentum which , when transformed to @xmath0 , can be written as @xmath112 .",
    "( ) _ i = k_p , i ( ^2 - 1)^-(q_p , i+1)/2 , which is valid also at low energies ( @xmath113 ) . at steady - state",
    "the spectral density is simply n_p()= .",
    "[ eq : ss_n_p_s ] the resulting spectrum is @xmath114 at energies for which the loss rate is dominated by electronic excitations , steepening to @xmath115 at energies ( above 1.22gev ) for which the loss rate is dominated by pion production .",
    "the energetic proton density is usually related to that of the electrons by assuming a near equality in the rates energetic protons and electrons escape the acceleration region ( e.g. , pohl 1993 , schlickeiser 2002 ) . in the spirit of our approach here ( whose objective is to estimate the impact of replacing a pl with a steady - state distribution ) , we adopt the charge neutrality assumption . in context of our approximate spectral ( rather than spectro - spatial ) steady - state treatment , the very different particle densities in the sbn and galactic disk would be explained as a consequence of the higher density of acceleration sites in the sbn , on the one hand , and the higher energy loss rates there on the other hand .",
    "if so , and equipartition is indeed attained , radio measurements then provide the observable needed to determine the proton energy density and mean strength of the magnetic field .",
    "use of the more realistic particle steady - state distributions , and consideration of the full spectral range of particle energies , appreciably improve on the standard calculation which is commonly based on pl spectra with a relatively high lower energy cutoff .",
    "specifically , we extend our numerical example representative of conditions in the sbn of m82 and ngc253 ( specified above ) by computing also the proton energy density .    the proton source spectrum is a pl with nearly the same index as for the electrons , i.e. @xmath116 , and the best - fit pl spectrum with index @xmath117 , a value deduced from @xmath0-ray measurements ( persic & rephaeli 2014 , and references therein ) . repeating the calculations in the latter work ( where all parameter values are specified ) but with the steady - state spectra obtained here ,",

    ", these values clearly show that the assumption of pl density spectra leads to significant overestimation of the electron energy density , and consequently also to overestimation of the proton and field energy densities ( assuming equipartition ) .",
    "the results presented in the previous section make it clear that the assumption of a pl distribution for energetic electrons and protons leads to large overestimation of their energy densities in comparison with the values deduced when more realistic steady - state spectral density distributions are used .",
    "we derived these distributions ( self - consistently ) by accounting for all relevant energy losses .",
    "our quantitative estimates of the factors by which the electron energy densities are overestimated when deduced from radio measurements are in the range @xmath122 for radio spectral indices in the range @xmath123 , when calculated for typical conditions in a sbn and the disk of a star - forming galaxy . the mere fact that in some of the analyses based on a pl distribution a high value of @xmath12 is assumed ( supposedly circumventing the need for explicit accounting for the spectral flattening due to coulomb losses ) does not reduce the inadequacy of the ( single - index ) pl model : clearly , considerations of energy equipartition are not valid when the particle energy density is calculated over only part of the energy range , particularly so when the relatively large contribution of the lower energy particles is ignored .",
    "curved synchrotron spectra may also be a consequence of spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields in the emitting region ( e.g. , hardcastle 2013 ) .",
    "of course , particle spectra are intrinsically curved when the distribution is either time - varying ( e.g. , torres 2012 ) or before a steady - state is reached . in our treatment here ( which is essentially complementary to the aforementioned works ) we calculate self - consistently the synchrotron spectrum emitted by electrons whose spectral density is curved due to all the relevant energy losses sustained while traversing a region with a uniformly distributed gas , magnetic , and radiation fields .",
    "the impact of this more realistic modeling of the particle spectrum is usually more important than that of spatial variation of the gas density and magnetic field , especially for estimation of the particle total energy density in high - density environments ( such as a sbn ) .",
    "compton scattering of relativistic electrons by ir and optical radiation fields in sbgs ( rephaeli , gruber & persic 1995 , wik 2014a ) , and by the cmb in galaxy clusters ( rephaeli 1979 , wik 2014b ) is likely to contribute appreciably to their x - and-@xmath0-ray spectra .",
    "as is clear from the spectra in figure 4 , estimating the level of hard x - ray emission by extrapolating the best - fit pl to the radio data can substantially under - predict the likelihood of its detection ( and obviously affect motivation for its search ) .",
    "moreover , the accuracy of joint analyses of radio and x - ray data can be improved substantially by using the properly normalized steady - state distribution for the electrons .    as specified in the previous section , low energy protons",
    "lose energy effectively by ionization ( in neutral media ) and energy excitation ( in ionized gas ) , in addition to catastrophic losses in proton - proton interactions . here",

    "the effectiveness of coulomb interactions of low energy electrons and protons with gaseous media obviously result in much lower steady - state spectral densities of low energy particles than what would be predicted from pl spectra .",

    "<S> energy densities of relativistic electrons and protons in extended galactic and intracluster regions are commonly determined from spectral radio and ( rarely ) @xmath0-ray measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the time - independent particle spectral density distributions are commonly assumed to have a power - law ( pl ) form over the relevant energy range . a theoretical relation between energy densities of electrons and protons </S>",
    "<S> is usually adopted , and energy equipartition is invoked to determine the mean magnetic field strength in the emitting region . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for typical conditions , in both star - forming and starburst galaxies , these estimates need to be scaled down substantially due to significant energy losses that ( effectively ) flatten the electron spectral density distribution , resulting in a much lower energy density than deduced when the distribution is assumed to have a pl form . </S>",
    "<S> the steady - state electron distribution in the nuclear regions of starburst galaxies is calculated by accounting for coulomb , bremsstrahlung , compton , and synchrotron losses ; the corresponding emission spectra of the latter two processes are calculated and compared to the respective pl spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine the proton steady - state distribution by taking into account coulomb and @xmath1 production losses , and briefly discuss implications of our steady - state particle spectra for estimates of proton energy densities and magnetic fields . </S>"
