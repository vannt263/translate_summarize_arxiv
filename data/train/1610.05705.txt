    "close - in giant planets are the most easily detected exoplanets today , as they are able to imprint significant radial velocities to their host star , and generate very clear transits . due to their proximity , the two main interactions with their host ( tides and magnetism , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are very strong compared to the case of solar system planets . in theory , fast and efficient exchanges of angular momentum and energy between the planet and its host are hence possible in theses systems , altering their secular evolution . as a result",
    ", significant efforts have been made in the past decades to look for observational signatures of these interactions , along with thorough theoretical research to better understand the physical mechanisms sustaining them .",
    "numerous puzzling observations of close - in systems have been recently reported .",
    "periodic anomalous chromospheric emissions have been observed on star harbouring a close - in hot jupiter @xcite .",
    "the on / off nature of these emissions suggest either a magnetic origin @xcite , or material infall from the orbiting planet @xcite . wasp-18 also possesses a close - in planet , and was reported to present a surprising lack x - ray emissions @xcite , which could also be accounted for by its interaction with the orbiting planet .",
    "finally , radio and uv emissions in close - in systems are intensively looked for today @xcite .",
    "these emissions are difficult to observe as they were not found to induce any statistical observational trend @xcite , likely due to their on / off nature .",
    "they may nevertheless be observed for some systems like hd 189733 for which an excess of absorption was reported during transit @xcite .",
    "the signal is possibly tracing the existence of a bow shock in front of the orbiting planet created by the magneto - hydrodynamical interaction between the planet and the wind of the host star .",
    "the population of exoplanets itself is also affected by star - planet interactions .",
    "stars hosting close - in planets tend to rotate more rapidly than planet - free twin stars @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of this trend is still debated today , but tides , magnetic interactions , or a combination of both are likely key to make close - in planets migrate and be absorbed by their host , transferring at the same time significant angular momentum to the star @xcite . in addition , a dearth of close - in planets around fast rotators was reported by several authors @xcite using kepler data .",
    "again , both tides and magnetic interactions could be vectors of angular momentum transfers in such systems , making close - in planets migrate efficiently and explaining this dearth .",
    "finally , some recent observations also report a possbile influence of close - in hot jupiter on the rotation and magnetic activity of their host @xcite , albeit larger samples of stars are today needed to confirm these trends .",
    "these observations challenge our understanding of interactions between a close - in planet and its host star .",
    "furthermore , a refined physical description of star - planet interaction is also today needed to guide the hunt for exoplanets .",
    "finally the anomalous , enhanced emissions ( being either in radios , uv or x - ray ) in such systems likely trace the existence of the magnetic field of the planet",
    ". a better theoretical understanding of the physical mechanisms sustaining these emissions could provide a way to characterize the magnetic field of close - in exoplanets with observations , or help us constrain the internal properties of the planet if it does not possess an intrinsic magnetic field , for which we do not have any constrains yet ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    among the means of interactions between a star and close - in planets , tides are by far the most studied aspect .",
    "they are known to lead to spin - orbit synchronisation @xcite , planet migration @xcite and star spin - up @xcite due to angular momentum exchange between the planet and the star .",
    "their efficiency was recently shown to depend on the internal structure of both the planet and the hosting star @xcite .",
    "while significant insights have been recently gained for tidal gravito - inertial waves ( see , _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fully non - linear interactions between tidal waves , and the properties of magneto - gravito - inertial waves , still need to be characterized to obtain a satisfying understanding of angular momentum transfers by tidal waves in planetary and stellar interiors .",
    "the close - in planets also receive intense radiation from their host due to their proximity .",
    "the associated ionization of the atmosphere of the planet allows an enhanced atmospheric escape from the planet @xcite .",
    "various types of such planetary outflows were found to exist , depending on the properties of the hosting star @xcite .",
    "if the planet is in a sufficiently close - in orbit , the escaping material may fall on the stellar surface , providing an additional variability to the chromospheric emissions of the star ( see , _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "finally , magnetic fields provide another systematic source of interaction between a star and close - in planet , often referenced to as `` star - planet magnetic interaction '' ( spmi ) .",
    "close - in giant planets are generally thought to orbit inside the alfvn surface of the wind of their host , _",
    "i.e. _ in a region where the local alfvn speed exceeds the velocity of the wind .",
    "this allows for particularly efficient transfers between the planet and its host @xcite , as alfvn waves carrying energy and momentum are able to travel between the two bodies .",
    "such close - in exoplanet systems are similar to planet - satellite systems in the solar system , with the additional complexity of the existence of a stellar wind . as a result ,",
    "the superposition of the alfvnic perturbations triggered by the orbital motion of the planet will form alfvn wings @xcite , which structure depends on the properties of the wind and of the planet magnetic field ( if any , see * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spmis will generally be a source of planet migration @xcite and stellar spin - up @xcite .",
    "for fast - rotating stars , the magnetic torque can be opposite such as to slow down the hosting star when the planet is beyond the co - rotation radius ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it nevertheless appears to be too weak to fully solve the so - called _ angular momentum problem for young stars _ @xcite .",
    "the energy channelled in the alfvn wings can also be a source of additional heating in the chromosphere of the host @xcite , which could potentially lead to anomalous emissions related to the existence of a close - in planet .",
    "this mechanism was recently shown @xcite to naturally provide an on / off source of energy for enhanced emissions .",
    "spmis are shaped by the stellar wind of the host star .",
    "the plasma conditions in the stellar wind determine whether the spmi will be super- or sub - alfvnic .",
    "the non - axisymmetry of real stellar magnetic fields can thus cause the spmi to change as a planet orbits in the wind @xcite .",
    "observations of the magnetic field ( using the zeeman doppler imaging technique , see _",
    "e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of planet - hosting star are thus of great importance to help constraining the possible spmis in real systems ( _ e.g. _ * ? ?",
    "* for the kepler-78 system ) .",
    "dedicated numerical simulations of stellar winds , based on observed magnetic topologies in 3d , are consequently necessary today @xcite .",
    "spmis also generally depend on the internal structure of the planet @xcite .",
    "when the planet is not able to sustain its own magnetic field , the stellar wind field is able to permeate into its interior , depending on its internal composition .",
    "this interaction , dubbed as _ unipolar _ ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can lead to planet inflation due to ohmic dissipation , as well as planet migration due to magnetic torques . in the case of a close - in planet operating a dynamo and sustaining its own magnetosphere",
    ", magnetic torques still develop depending on the magnetic topology @xcite , and the interaction is then referred to as _",
    "dipolar_.    the aim of this work is to provide a parametrization of the main effects of magnetic interaction in the dipolar case , relevant for ( i ) the orbital migration of a planet and the associated spin - up ( or down ) of its host , and ( ii ) the existence of enhanced emissions in close - in systems .",
    "our study is built on a 3d magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) global model , in which a magnetized planet is introduced in a close - in orbit in a self - consistently simulated stellar wind .",
    "this model will be briefly described in section [ sec : param - based - grid ] .",
    "we present here a grid of numerical simulations where we vary the orbital radius of the planet and the strength of its magnetic field .",
    "we propose a parametrization of the magnetic torque applied to the planet ( section [ sec : planet - migration - due ] ) , and of the magnetic energy flux driving enhanced emissions in the system ( section [ sec : magn - energy - flux ] ) .",
    "the effect of ohmic dissipation on spmis is quantified in section [ sec : role - dissipation-1 ] , and we finally summarize and discuss our results in section [ sec : summary - conclusions ] .",
    "the model used in this work is described in details in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the mhd formalism to describe the interaction of a magnetized planet with a self - consistently driven stellar wind .",
    "the system of equations is written in a frame rotating with the orbiting planet , which enables numerically to set the orbiting planet at a fix position in a grid centered on the rotating hosting star .",
    "the grid resolution is enhanced around the star ( @xmath0 ) and the planetary magnetosphere ( @xmath1 ) , and the grid is stretched away from the central star elsewhere .",
    "the grid used in this work is slightly coarser than in @xcite , in order to be able to produce a grid of numerical simulations with accessible computational ressources .",
    "the set of mhd equations we solve is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the plasma density , @xmath4 its velocity , @xmath5 the gas pressure , @xmath6 the magnetic field , @xmath7 is composed of the gravity , coriolis , and centrifugal forces , @xmath8 the sound speed ( @xmath9 is the adiabatic exponent , taken to be the equal to the ratio of specific heats and set in this work to 1.05 ) , and @xmath10 is the current density .",
    "we use an ideal gas equation of state @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the internal energy per mass .",
    "compared to the model described in @xcite , we have here added the possibility to introduce ohmic diffusivity .",
    "two types of diffusivities can be used .",
    "the first , controlled by the ohmic diffusion coefficient @xmath13 , is a standard ohmic diffusion used only inside the planetary boundary condition mimicking a crude ionospheric layer ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "this standard diffusivity can be viewed as a very simple modelling of the actual pedersen conductivity which dominates ohmic dissipation in this region ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second , controlled by the ohmic diffusion coefficient @xmath14 , is an enhanced diffusivity which is restricted to current sheets in the simulations .",
    "an activation criterion @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the maximal size of the local grid cell , and @xmath18 ensures that @xmath15 does not diverge .",
    "the enhanced diffusivity is activated based on the criterion @xmath15 as follows ( see , _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the anomalous diffusion coefficient .",
    "such enhanced diffusion is very useful to control how the magnetic field reconnects in current sheets , while not affecting the remaining of the modelled system with an additional spurious ohmic dissipation . in section [ sec : role - dissipation-1 ]",
    "we quantify the dependency of the global trends derived with a grid of numerical simulations ( see sections [ sec : planet - migration - due ] and [ sec : magn - energy - flux ] ) to the enhanced diffusivity , which can be used to trace the impact of the reconnection efficiency and/or the numerical resolution in other studies .",
    "the mhd equations are discretized and solved using the pluto code @xcite .",
    "they are solved using a second - order , linear spatial interpolation coupled to an hll riemann solver with a _ minmod _ flux limiter .",
    "they are advanced in time with a second - order runge - rutta method .",
    "the solenoidality of @xmath21 ( equation [ eq : divb ] ) is ensured with a constrained transport method @xcite , and the magnetic field is decomposed into a background field ( composed of two dipolar fields , one for the star and one for the planet ) .",
    "pioneering numerical simulations of star - planet magnetic interaction were conducted by @xcite in a local domain around a close - in planet for prescribed stellar wind parameters .",
    "inhomogeneities in stellar winds and the detailed global magnetic topology nevertheless strongly impact the strength and geometry of star - planet magnetic interactions , which warrants a global modelling of star - planet systems . in particular , the detailed knowledge of the three dimensional structure of the alfvn wings developing in the system is needed to calculate the magnetic torque which applies to a close - in orbiting planet ( see section [ sec : planet - migration - due ] ) .",
    "@xcite carried out the first 3d global simulations of star - planet systems by including a planet as a boundary layer in a stellar wind numerical model and neglecting the planet orbital motion .",
    "this limitation was further alleviated in @xcite by considering a planetary boundary condition changing position with time to mimic an orbital motion .",
    "here we follow a different route and hold the planet fixed in the numerical grid by solving equations ( [ eq : mass_consrv_pluto]-[eq : divb ] ) in a frame rotating at the orbital rotation rate .",
    "finally , the last particularity of our model lies in its planetary boundary condition : it is designed to mimic the coupling to an ionospheric layer which conductive properties affect the strength of the star - planet magnetic interaction ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and section [ sec : role - dissipation-1 ] ) .    in this work",
    ", we consider only a dipolar ( axisymmetric ) magnetic field for the star . the planetary magnetic field is also considered to be a dipole , but can be locally either _ aligned _ or _ anti - aligned _ with the ambient stellar wind field at the orbital radius .",
    "we restrict the present exploration to these two topologies , which are expected to give respectively the maximal and minimal magnetic interaction strength @xcite .",
    "we present here a grid of such numerical simulations where the orbital radius ( 4 different radii ) and the planetary magnetic field ( 3 different amplitudes ) are varied for each of the two topologies .",
    "we furthermore explored the influence of ohmic diffusion for two of these simulations , giving a total of 36 3d non - linear simulations in this study .",
    "a summary of the parameters of this set of simulations , as well as the main numerical results discussed in the following sections , are given in appendix [ sec : mod_param_appendix ] .",
    "by analogy with an obstacle in a flow , the magnetic torque applied to the planet due to spmi is generally written as ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the orbital radius of the planet , @xmath24 is the effective obstacle area exposed to the flow , @xmath25 the total ( thermal plus ram plus magnetic ) pressure of the wind in the frame where the planet is at rest , and @xmath26 a drag coefficient . the right hand side is conveniently composed of the total angular momentum that can be transfered to an obstacle of cross - section area @xmath24 , multiplied by @xmath26 . in the case of spmi ,",
    "the drag coefficient @xmath26 and the effective area @xmath24 should generally depend on the topology of the interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ on the relative orientations of the orbital motion , the interplanetary magnetic field , and the planetary magnetic field . due to this complexity , the drag coefficient @xmath26 and the effective interaction area @xmath24 can be non trivial to estimate .",
    "fortunately , most terms in equation [ eq : proto_torq ] can be directly estimated in our set of numerical simulations .",
    "the net torque @xmath27 applied to the planet can be calculated by integrating the angular momentum balance on a sphere encircling the planet ( see appendix a in * ? ? ?",
    "the total pressure of the wind @xmath25 can naturally be estimated from the plasma conditions in the wind at the planetary orbit in our simulations and can be _ a priori _ parametrized from the stellar parameters ( section [ sec : effect - press - plan ] ) .",
    "the two remaining parameters , @xmath26 and @xmath28 , require a careful evaluation in our simulations .",
    "we detail their estimation in sections [ sec : drag - coefficient ] and [ sec : effect - area - inter ] respectively .",
    "( black line ) is well approximated with equation [ eq : pt_approx ] ( magenta dashed line ) . ]    because we consider planets orbiting inside the alfvn surface around cool stars , the magnetic pressure of the wind almost always dominates its total pressure ( since the wind speed is smaller than the local alfvn speed ) .",
    "if the dominant topology of the stellar magnetic field is a dipole or a quadrupole , the magnetic pressure also generally dominates the ram pressure @xmath29 ( the ram velocity is defined as @xmath30 is the keplerian velocity for a circular orbit . ] ) , even for close - in planets ( we recall here that the effective total pressure is evaluated in the frame where the planet is at rest , which is why the keplerian velocity enters the definition of the ram pressure ) .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : pressures ] the magnetic , ram and thermal components of the total pressure @xmath25 in the wind considered in this work .",
    "we indeed observe that the total pressure is dominated by the magnetic component for the close - in planets considered here ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "note nevertheless that this is not necessarily true for higher order topologies , and depends strongly on how the density profile falls off in the lower corona .    in the case of a dipolar magnetic field",
    ", the total pressure @xmath25 at the orbital radius can be approximated by ( see dashed line in figure [ fig : pressures ] ) @xmath32 nevertheless , we will hereafter always consider the total pressure @xmath25 rather than this approximated formulation . when applied to a case where the stellar magnetic field is mainly dipolar and aligned with the rotation axis , one may simply use the approximation in equation [ eq : pt_approx ] .",
    "the drag coefficient is generally thought to represent in the case of spmi the reconnection efficiency between the stellar wind and the planetary magnetic field , at the boundaries of the planetary magnetosphere or of the alfvn wings themselves . in some interaction cases",
    ", it also depends on the conductivity of the obstacle . in the context of planetary radio emissions in the unipolar interaction case ( similar to io - jupiter interaction ) , @xcite approximated @xmath26 with @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the local alfvnic mach number near the obstacle ( @xmath35 is the local alfvn speed ) .",
    "they argue that in the case of a dipolar interaction , @xmath26 depends on the conductivity in the ionosphere but takes similar values as in equation [ eq : reconnection_coeff ] . @xcite use a different measure of @xmath26 based on the pedersen conductance @xmath36 ( which is the pedersen conductivity integrated over the ionosphere ) , which can be approximated by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the alfvn conductance ( where @xmath39 is the speed of light ) .",
    "it is instructive to note that in the limit of small @xmath40 ( for which equation [ eq : reconnection_coeff_2 ] was derived ) , and for small @xmath41 ( in this work @xmath42 cm / s , while conservative estimates of @xmath36 give value of the order of @xmath43 cm / s , see * ? ?",

    "this phenomenon is illustrated on the left panels of figure [ fig : effective_area_2cases ] for an anti - aligned case , where the magnetic field lines in the plane perpendicular to ecliptic plane are shown in the upper panel , and the streamlines of the flow ( in the frame where the planet is at rest ) in the ecliptic are shown in the bottom panel .",

    "the origin of this dependency lies in the type of obstacle that develops in the aligned case . in this case",
    ", the open magnetic field lines at the pole of the planet ( which we suppose to be anchored to the planet ) , face the stellar wind and henceforth have to be considered as part of the planetary obstacle . as a result ,",
    "the effective area depends on the inclination angle of the alfvn wings , which is controlled by @xmath40 , and the effective area in the aligned case has also to depend on @xmath40 , as observed in figure [ fig : fit_a ] .",
    "though , should the full alfvn wing cross - section be considered as the effective obstacle area ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the situation is slightly more complicated and can be understood as follows ( see schematics in the upper panels of figure [ fig : effective_area ] ) .",
    "the alfvn wings are populated by alfvnic perturbations triggered on the ecliptic plane at the magnetopause where the stellar wind magnetic field and the planetary magnetic field reconnect ( see the current sheet in the lower right panel of figure [ fig : effective_area_2cases ] ) .",

    "this distance defines the portion of the alfvn wings that is relevant for the angular momentum extraction from the planetary orbit by the magnetic interaction .",
    "we show in panel d the flow in the ecliptic plane and the alfvn characteristics out of it with a 3d view for an aligned case .",

    "this area is shown by the blue and red areas in panel e ( we have two areas here since interaction develops two alfvn wings ) . using these alfvn wing areas we can associate a travel distance [ @xmath65 from the reconnection site on the ecliptic plane , which corresponds to a travel time @xmath66 of the alfvnic perturbations up to such a distance along the alfvn wings , given by @xmath67 for the northern alfvn wing , where @xmath68 is the infinitesimal distance along the alfvn wing , and @xmath69 is the corresponding alfvn characteristic .",
    "considering that the plasma sweeps around the magnetospheric obstacle with an average velocity @xmath70 on the ecliptic plane , we can deduce what should be the extent of the magnetospheric obstacle in the stream direction [ @xmath61 ] to account for an effective area of interaction @xmath24 by @xmath72 we report this deduced distance on the lower right panel in figure [ fig : effective_area_2cases ] .",
    "we recall here that we deduced @xmath73 only from the effective area of interaction @xmath24 ( equation [ eq : aeff_num ] ) , and from the shape of the alfvn wings ( to estimate @xmath66 ) .",
    "we observe that @xmath61 is indeed an excellent approximation of the size of the magnetospheric obstacle in the stream direction ( see figure [ fig : effective_area_2cases ] ) , validating our interpretation of the effective area of interaction in the aligned case of the close - in star - planet interaction ( figure [ fig : effective_area ] ) .",
    "we recall that in the anti - aligned case , the magnetosphere is closed and this interpretation naturally does not apply .",
    "our sample of simulations also include super - alfvnic cases , shown in magenta in figure [ fig : fit_a ] . in the aligned case",
    ", they seem to follow the same trend as the sub - alfvnic cases .",
    "the effective area appears to drop for the anti - aligned cases , certainly due to the appearance of a shock in front of the magnetospheric obstacle .",
    "this warrants further investigation of the sub- to super - alfvnic transition of the interaction .",
    "we intend to explore this transition in a future work .",
    "the magnetic torque that develop in close - in star - planet systems can hence be parametrized using a combination of equations [ eq : proto_torq ] and [ eq : aeff_fit ] , with different exponents ( listed in table [ ta : aeff_fit ] ) depending on the magnetic topology of the interaction topology .",
    "the migration time - scale of the planet due to the magnetic interaction can subsequently be calculated as follows :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the orbital angular momentum of the planet and the factor 2 accounts for the @xmath76 dependancy of @xmath77 . note that the magnetospheric obstacle on the ecliptic plane may also depend on the reconnection efficiency of magnetic field lines in the current sheet that develops .",

    "the alfvn wings also channel energy between the planet and the star in the form of alfvn waves . the energy flux can be quantified by the poynting flux in the alfvn wing , given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the electric field in the ideal mhd approximation and @xmath80 are the alfvn characteristics .",
    "the power @xmath81 associated with the poynting flux can be simply obtained by integrating @xmath82 over the alfvn wing cross - section ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath83    in order to estimate the accessible power for radio emissions in star - planet systems , @xcite proposed the following formulation @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the incident poynting flux of the stellar wind . in a more recent study , and in the context of aligned configurations",
    ", @xcite found analytically a slightly different formulation which can be written @xmath86 where @xmath47 is defined in equation [ eq : reconnection_coeff_1 ] .    in our simulations ,",
    "we know _ a priori _ the values of @xmath26 ( see section [ sec : drag - coefficient ] ) and @xmath87 .",
    "we hence follow the same procedure as in section [ sec : planet - migration - due ] ( see equation [ eq : aeff_fit ] ) and fit the following normalized total poynting flux with @xmath88    the fitted coefficients are shown in table [ ta : poy_fit ] and the resulting fits in figure [ fig : fit_poy ] .",
    "the expression of the poynting flux proposed in the literature ( equations [ eq : p_zarka ] and [ eq : p_saur ] ) directly depend on the obstacle area , in a similar fashion than the torque derived in section [ sec : planet - migration - due ] . as a result , it can be surprising that in our simulations the poynting flux appears to vary with @xmath50 with slightly weaker exponent than the torque .",
    "note nonetheless that within the error bars of the two fits , one may consider a common exponent for the two expressions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath89 .",
    "it is remarkable that all simulations , including the two different topologies , can be approximated with a single exponent for the dependancy upon @xmath50 .",
    "this shows the robustness of the primary source of the magnetic star - planet interaction under various situations , which is characterized by the pressure balance between the ram pressure of the impacting wind and the magnetic pressure of the magnetospheric obstacle .",
    "lccc anti - aligned & 0.8 @xmath56 0.2 & 0.26 @xmath56 0.03 & 1.40 @xmath56 0.10 + aligned & 9.7 @xmath56 2.8 & 0.23 @xmath56 0.04 & 1.09 @xmath56 0.13    in contrast with the magnetic torque , the poynting flux depends on @xmath40 in both the aligned and anti - aligned cases ( lower panel in figure [ fig : fit_poy ] ) .",
    "previous estimates of the poynting flux ( equations [ eq : p_zarka ] and [ eq : p_saur ] ) imply that @xmath90 only depends on the effective obstacle area . in @xcite ,",
    "the obstacle is the simplified magnetospheric obstacle @xmath53 ( equation [ eq : aeff_v0 ] ) , and as result in their scaling law @xmath90 only depends on @xmath50 .",
    "we already saw that at least in the aligned case the obstacle estimation ( equation [ eq : aeff_v0 ] ) is not satisfying , hence we do not expect our results to follow equation [ eq : p_zarka ] . in @xcite , the effective area appearing in equation",
    "[ eq : p_saur ] corresponds to the cross - section of the alfvn wing itself .",
    "this cross - section is not trivial to estimate without calculating the non - linear interaction between the planet magnetosphere and the stellar wind .",
    "our numerical results provide a simple parametrization of the dependancy of this area to the wind alfvnic mach number @xmath40 , as shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig : fit_poy ] .",
    "they allow us to extend the scaling law derived by @xcite by clarifying an additional dependancy of the cross - section area of the alfvn wings .",
    "( see equation [ eq : poy_fit ] ) .",
    "the symbols are the same as in figure [ fig : fit_a ] .",
    "the coefficients of the fits are reported in table [ ta : poy_fit ] . ]",
    "the fact that @xmath90 depends on @xmath40 in the anti - aligned case can appear counter - intuitive .",
    "in fact , one has to remember that we quantify here the energy flux channelled _ through the wings_. since the wings themselves depend on @xmath40 , @xmath90 is expected to depend on @xmath40 in all cases .",
    "this was not the case for the magnetic torque in the anti - aligned cases , as in these cases the torque applies mainly on the magnetospheric obstacle rather than the alfvn wings themselves .",
    "up to this point we have not considered yet the important aspect of ohmic dissipation in our discussion .",
    "because all the simulations carried in this work have an equivalent numerical resolution around the planetary magnetosphere , we expect the scaling laws we derived in sections [ sec : planet - migration - due ] and [ sec : magn - energy - flux ] to hold up to different dissipation properties .",
    "nonetheless , we expect the multiplicative coefficients of the scaling laws ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) to be sensitive to dissipation .",
    "we now quantify this effect .",
    "we have considered so far only cases with no explicit dissipation ( @xmath93 in equations [ eq : ener_consrv_pluto ] and [ eq : induction_pluto ] ) , letting the numerical scheme set the level of dissipation in our simulations .",
    "we explore here two important aspects of ohmic dissipation that can affect the scaling laws derived in sections [ sec : planet - migration - due ] and [ sec : magn - energy - flux ] .",
    "we first explore the influence of ohmic dissipation [ @xmath13 ] in the ionospheric boundary layer of our model ( section [ sec : diss - ionosph ] ) .",
    "we then turn to the effect of anomalous ohmic dissipation [ @xmath14 ] that is triggered automatically ( see equation [ eq : enhanced_res ] ) in strong currents sheets in our model ( section [ sec : diss - reconn - curr ] ) .",
    "we first consider an enhanced ohmic dissipation coefficient @xmath13 in our planetary boundary condition mimicking a crude ionospheric layer .",
    "the ohmic diffusion coefficient can be related to the integrated pedersen conductivity by ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 stands for the characteristic height of the atmosphere ( or ionosphere ) of the exoplanet . both the pedersen conductivity @xmath36 and @xmath97 are observationally unconstrained for close - in planets possessing an ionosphere .",
    "conservative estimates of both parameters ( based on solar system planets and moons ) lead to ohmic diffusion coefficients between @xmath43 and @xmath98 @xmath99/s ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to alleviate the degeneracy of our scalings laws with respect to @xmath13 , we report here on a series of simulations with @xmath100 and @xmath101 for which we systematically increased @xmath13 up to @xmath102 @xmath99/s .",
    "the resulting effective area of the interaction @xmath24 ( equation [ eq : aeff_num ] ) and normalized poynting flux @xmath90 ( equation [ eq : poy_fit ] ) are shown in figure [ fig : fit_etap ] for the aligned ( diamonds ) and anti - aligned ( circle ) cases .    .",
    "all the cases have @xmath103 and @xmath101 .",
    "the layout is the same as in figures [ fig : fit_a ] and [ fig : fit_poy ] .",
    "the horizontal lines label the values obtained when no explicit dissipation is considered . ]",
    "we first notice that the anti - aligned cases are largely insensitive to @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , in the anti - aligned cases the planetary magnetosphere is closed and only a few field lines are able to reconnect between the polar cap of the planet and the ambient wind . as a result , the resistivity in the ionospheric boundary layer is largely unimportant in those cases .",
    "the aligned cases show a weak dependency upon @xmath13 , shown by the black dashed line in each panel .",
    "this trend allows us to estimate that @xmath104 @xmath99/s in our reference models with no explicit diffusivities .    as @xmath13",
    "is decreased ( which here could be achieved by reducing the grid size , for an increased computational cost ) , the associated pedersen conductance increases and finally ends up dominating over the alfvn conductance @xmath105 ( see equation [ eq : reconnection_coeff_2 ] ) . in this case",
    "the interaction is supposed to saturate , with an effective drag that can be approximated by @xmath40 . given that both the torque and the poynting flux depend weakly on @xmath13 , our set of simulations already give robust estimates of both effects .",
    "nevertheless , depending on the star - planet system one is interested in , the ohmic dissipation coefficient @xmath13 ( when estimated from adequate modelling of the exoplanet ionosphere ) can be added to our scaling laws of the magnetic torque and poynting fluxes .",
    "we now turn to the stronger effect of an anomalous resistivity in the strong current sheets developing due to the magnetic interaction .",
    "we now turn to a series of simulations where we activate the enhanced dissipation @xmath14 ( equation [ eq : enhanced_res ] ) controlled by the ohmic diffusion coefficient @xmath20 .",
    "this enhanced dissipation activates only in strong current sheets that develop in the simulation .",
    "it is designed to mimic fast reconnection process , that would otherwise be completely controlled by the unavoidable ( and slow ) numerical dissipation of the numerical scheme .",
    "we show the effective area of interaction and the normalized poynting flux in figure [ fig : fit_eta ] .",
    "the layout is the same as in figure [ fig : fit_etap ] , with the horizontal axis representing the anomalous ohmic diffusion coefficient @xmath20 .",
    "we first note that for either the aligned and anti - aligned cases , the effective area of interaction is only mildly affected by the enhanced dissipation .",
    "the reconnection rate between the planetary and wind magnetic fields has indeed little impact on the shape of the obstacle , and hence does not affect much the torque that applies to the planetary obstacle .",
    "in the aligned case , the anomalous dissipation nevertheless changes slightly the size of the magnetospheric obstacle in the stream direction ( see bottom right panel in figure [ fig : effective_area_2cases ] ) .",
    "a larger dissipation tends to extend spatially the currents sheets ( while reducing their strength ) , leading to an effective increase of the stream - wise size @xmath106 of the obstacle , and consequently of @xmath24 .",
    "our simulations suggest that the effective area changes roughly proportionally to @xmath107 in the aligned case ( more simulations would be needed to determine this exponent more accurately ) .    .",
    "the layout is the same as in figure [ fig : fit_etap ] . ]    while anomalous diffusion has only a small effect on the magnetic torque that applies to the planet , the poynting flux generated by the magnetic interaction is strongly affected by it ( lower panel in figure [ fig : fit_eta ] ) . in the anti - aligned case ,",
    "the closed magnetosphere makes the reconnection sites located primarily near the poles of the planetary magnetic field , restricted to a small area . in this case , the poynting flux is carried by perturbations launched from those sites , and as a result turns to be very sensitive to magnetic field reconnection there .",
    "the poynting flux in the aligned cases presents a significantly weaker ( though not negligible ) dependancy to @xmath20 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "this weaker dependancy reflects the change in topology : in the aligned case , the interface between the magnetosphere and the stellar wind on the ecliptic plane is the main the reconnection site of the interaction .",
    "its shape , size and properties are hence primarily set by the pressure balance shaping the magnetospheric obstacle ( see section [ sec : effect - area - inter ] ) , and the reconnection efficiency controlled by @xmath20 then adds second - order effects to its shape and size . as a result , the poynting flux in the aligned case is less sensitive than in the anti - aligned case , for which the reconnection site is almost completely controlled by @xmath20 .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note the poynting flux systematically decreases with the anomalous diffusion coefficient .",
    "this relatively strong dependency warrants further investigation of the close - in spmis using more realistic magnetic reconnection models .",
    "we intend to return to this aspect in a future publication , in a particular for the aligned topologies for which spmis could provide an innovative mean of characterizing the magnetic fields of exoplanets .",
    "in this work we have explored a parametrization of the effects of star - planet magnetic interaction in close - in systems in the dipolar case .",
    "we have parametrized the magnetic torque applied to the planet , and the magnetic energy flux that can be channeled towards the star due to this interaction .",
    "thanks to a grid of numerical simulations spanning various planetary orbits , planetary magnetic fields , and dissipation properties , we propose the following generic parameterizations    @xmath109    the two formulations are separated into groups of parameters depending only on the wind properties ( first parenthesis ) , the planet properties ( second parenthesis ) , and a combination of both ( third parenthesis ) .",
    "the exponents appearing in these formulations are given in tables [ ta : aeff_fit ] and [ ta : poy_fit ] , and in figures [ fig : fit_etap ] and [ fig : fit_eta ] for @xmath110 .",
    "they depend on the topology of the interaction , and are given here for the two extreme cases of aligned ( strong interaction ) and anti - aligned ( weak interaction ) topologies . as a result , these generic formulations can be used in combination with observational data    formulations ( [ eq : param_final_t]-[eq : param_final_p ] ) can furthermore be used in combination with independent stellar wind models . as an example",
    ", one could use a simple potential field extrapolation technique @xcite to derive the magnetic properties of the stellar wind of a given star , and further use the torque and poynting fluxes formulations proposed in this work to estimate the migration time - scale and accessible energy fluxes for particular close - in star - planet systems .",
    "we have furthermore explored the dependency of our results upon ohmic dissipation in the planet ionosphere ( section [ sec : diss - ionosph ] ) and in the reconnecting sites ( section [ sec : diss - reconn - curr ] ) .",
    "we have introduced the normalized ohmic dissipation coefficients @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which are the physical dissipation coefficients normalized to the numerical dissipation coefficients deduced from our set of simulations .",
    "a normalizing ohmic dissipation coefficient @xmath113 @xmath99/s can be used as a first approximation in all cases ( see section [ sec : role - dissipation-1 ] for details ) . in combination with the numerical values of the multiplicative factor @xmath91 and @xmath92 , that were derived for a given numerical resolution",
    ", these normalized ohmic dissipation coefficients make the formulations independent of our grid resolution .",
    "we have shown that in the aligned case of the dipolar interaction , the effective area of the interaction is not well approximated by the classical magnetospheric obstacle .",
    "we demonstrated that it could be viewed as a portion of the alfvn wings developing due to the magnetic interaction .",
    "the exact subpart of the wings that composes the effective area depends on the elongation of the magnetosphere of the planet in the stream direction , as schematized in figure [ fig : effective_area ] . as a result , the magnetic torque applied to the orbiting body can be much larger than if it was only applied to a simple magnetospheric obstacle .",
    "our estimates of the magnetic torque ( equation [ eq : param_final_t ] ) can readily be implemented in secular evolution models involving close - in planets , to be systematically compared to tidal migration ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "various topologies and magnetic field amplitudes can easily be considered .",
    "coupled to simple stellar wind models , our formulation allows to determine possible synthetic populations of exoplanets accounting for the magnetic interactions , which could be compared to the actual distribution of close - in exoplanets observed today .    the poynting flux formulation ( equation [ eq : param_final_p ] ) can be used to estimate potentially observable traces of star - planet magnetic interactions in distant systems ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "thanks to the versatile formulation presented here , the cases of aligned and anti - aligned configurations can be easily considered , a quantitative estimate of the energy flux originating from the magnetic interaction can be obtained , and the dependancy upon the ionospheric properties of the planet can be incorporated . in combination with dedicated stellar wind models for real non - axisymmetric magnetic configurations ,",
    "the poynting flux ( equation [ eq : param_final_p ] ) can be applied to estimate the energy source which could drive enhanced emissions on particular stars hosting close - in planets . in turn",
    ", the observations of such enhanced emissions could be combined with our estimate of the poynting flux to infer the possible magnetic field of observed exoplanets ( for a first step in this direction , see * ? ? ?",
    "finally , some caveats need to be mentioned before using the scaling laws derived in this work .",
    "first , our modelling of the ionosphere of the planet remains very crude at this stage . a more detailed ionospheric coupling ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be implemented to incorporate more realistic current distributions in the ionosphere , and inhomogeneous pedersen conductance profiles that likely arise in tidally synchronized close - in system due to the day / night asymmetry .",
    "second , the sensitivity of the simulated poynting flux to an anomalous ohmic diffusion warrants further investigations with more realistic magnetic reconnection models .",
    "we aim to study the implications of these aspects for the scaling laws derived here in a future work .",
    "finally , we have focused here on the cases of planets sustaining their own magnetic field .",
    "star - planet magnetic interactions can also develop in cases where the planet does not possess an intrinsic magnetic field , nor an ionosphere ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when applying the scaling laws to real systems , the possibility that the exoplanet does not operate a dynamo shall always be considered along the dipolar interaction scenario .",
    "we also wish to explore this unipolar regime with numerical simulations in a future publication .",
