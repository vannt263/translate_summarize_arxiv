    "studying the stellar evolution in terms of chromospheric activities and kinematics of stars themselves within the galaxy could also impact on what we know about planetary nebulae ( pne ) when the star s interiors are completely revealed with enriched matter content which will be fed to interstellar medium ( ism ) with stellar wind , and therefore enriching the ism .",
    "the key point in these studies lie in the spectroscopic observations of pne when accurate emission line fluxes are measured ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , with the help of this knowledge we can understand how these regions are related to the general structure of the ism .    in the past",
    "there were several works that they have relied on standard star observations using broad band photometry or spectrophotometry , or even using photon counting detectors .",
    "however , these observations help little in improving the emission line flux standards of pne , hii regions , cataclysmic variables , supernova remnants , etc .",
    "( ) . for photon counting coupled with interference filters : @xcite ; they had several large error sources such as unknown central wavelength of transmission curves , temperature variations , filter age and misalignment of various optical components . for broad band photometry ( @xcite ) and spectrophotometry : ( @xcite ) ; even though there are many type of standard stars available , the flux standards of emission lines are still not adequate in number .",
    "in addition to this , several emission and absorption lines coincide in continuum standards ( e.g. balmer series ) and when narrow band filters are used , exact contribution of the line fluxes would be difficult .",
    "contrary to abovementioned observation methods , using low read - out noise and high quantum efficiency ccds , spectrophotometry of emission lines of pne s could very accurately be measured even for faint sources .",
    "therefore , high precision photometric studies of the emission line fluxes of ionized nebulae are needed .",
    "lately , @xcite ( hereafter d97 ) made slitless spectrophotometric observation of southern compact pne chosen from the catalog of @xcite ( hereafter a92 ) .",
    "they gave , , and laboratory wavelengths of and emission lines for 39 pne . for northern hemisphere sources ( hereafter w05 ) presented all emission lines of only 6 pne using similar techniques .",
    "although this was off to a good start , it is not sufficient for northern hemisphere .    by increasing the northern hemisphere sources to 17 with this work ,",
    "a complete set of emission line standards will be builded up for both hemisphere .",
    "the catalog of a92 includes 1142 pne .",
    "therefore , it is used as the main source of our work .",
    "the pne to be observed were selected according to the following criteria :    * to select only northern hemisphere pne , first declination is limited to @xmath1 which reduces the total number to 838 . *",
    "then , ra in between 7@xmath2 and 12@xmath2 are excluded from the selection which reduces the total number to 805 pne . * from this subset , angular size of pne smaller than 5 arcsecond are selected ( pne fits to the available slit size ) .",
    "this reduced the total number to 276 pne . * then , less studied 12 pne were selected . *",
    "5 pne which were studied by w05 were added to this subset increasing the total number to 17 ."
