    "<S> a measurement based on @xmath52 only involves the two states @xmath23 , it allows us to use a spin  echo technique to cancel out the dynamic phase . while a spin - echo is typically implemented by applying an inverting @xmath80 pulse , here we prefer to engineer the effective hamiltonian so that the states @xmath23 are effectively swapped during the second half of the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this is accomplished by repeating the phase sweep with an opposite detuning , an opposite phase variation , and a phase shift of @xmath80 [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) and @xcite ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , instead of varying the phase @xmath4 by a full cycle ( @xmath63 ) , we vary it by a fraction @xmath108 of the full cycle . </S>",
    "<S> we repeat the measurement for incremental values of @xmath92 and record the corresponding @xmath96-state population @xmath97 at the end of the sequence . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol , based on a noncyclic geometric phase @xcite , admits a similar geometric interpretation as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) , provided the open ends of the paths described by @xmath23 are connected to the initial state @xmath29 by geodesic lines @xcite . with this prescription </S>",
    "<S> , one finds that the acquired geometric phase is a linear function of @xmath92 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vbp_detuned](b ) we plot representative traces of @xmath97 versus @xmath92 , for @xmath24 and different values of the detuning @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data ( dots ) are fitted to sinusoidal oscillations ( solid lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the acquired geometric phase @xmath66 after a full cycle ( @xmath63 ) is related to the frequency @xmath96 of the oscillations ( with respect to @xmath92 ) by @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> no oscillations are observed for @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in good agreement with the results of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vbp_ramsey ] : at resonance , both states @xmath23 acquire the same phase . </S>",
    "<S> as we move away from resonance , we observe oscillations of increasing frequency , indicating the accumulation of a geometric phase . </S>",
    "<S> the visibility of the oscillations decreases at higher detunings , due to our choice of @xmath35 as the reference state @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vbp_detuned](c ) we plot the geometric phase difference @xmath110 versus the detuning @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> different symbols correspond to different photon numbers @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> we simultaneously fit our model expression , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , to all data sets ( solid lines ) , with the coupling constant @xmath100 as the only fit parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the data are in good quantitative agreement with the model , with deviations of the order of a few percent at large detunings and higher photon numbers . from the global fit </S>",
    "<S> we extract the value @xmath112 . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> an independent estimation based on rabi oscillations gives @xmath113 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the @xmath114 discrepancy between these two values to frequency - dependent attenuation in our input line ( which includes a mixer and a room - temperature amplifier ) as well as to higher - order transitions in our atom - cavity system , not accounted for in our model .    </S>",
    "<S> the berry phase induced by a quantized field can be thought of as a nontrivial combination of the geometric phase acquired by a quantum two - level system @xcite and that acquired by a harmonic oscillator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments provide clear evidence of this phase , thus putting the theory predictions in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite on a solid empirical basis . </S>",
    "<S> the techniques demonstrated here may open new avenues for the geometric manipulation of atom - cavity systems , including geometric control of cavity states @xcite and cavity - assisted holonomic gates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , our pulse scheme can be directly exploited to impart a geometric phase onto specific fock states in the cavity , similarly to the results presented in a previous study @xcite . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> two consecutive , phase - shifted p pulses on the @xmath29@xmath28 transition realize a fock state  selective phase gate in a time @xmath115 , where @xmath100 is the tunable coupling . </S>",
    "<S> different fock states can be simultaneously addressed by exploiting the cavity - induced stark shift on the @xmath29@xmath28 transition , which is about 15 mhz in our system ( see the supplementary materials ) . as a further application </S>",
    "<S> , the tunable coupling could be used to induce a cavity - mediated interaction between two transmons , paving the way for the realization of a two - qubit geometric gate based on non - abelian holonomies @xcite .    </S>",
