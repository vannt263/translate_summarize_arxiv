    "unraveling the pattern of soft and collinear divergences in scattering amplitudes is a critical endeavor to advance our understanding of gauge theories in general and to assist in concrete computations for collider phenomenology , e.g. , in massless gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "these studies have a long history ( see e.g. the early review  @xcite ) and have contributed to our knowledge of the universal infrared ( ir ) structure of gauge theory amplitudes .",
    "based on the concepts of soft and collinear factorization , non - abelian exponentiation , and the study of collinear limits , significant information about scattering amplitudes is available to all orders in perturbation theory . for precision predictions at modern colliders , especially within qcd and",
    "including higher order quantum corrections , these insights are of great practical importance  @xcite .",
    "quite generally , factorization implies the separation of scales in a given scattering reaction , i.e. the process - dependent hard scale @xmath9 from those governing the soft and collinear limit , defined for instance by the masses @xmath10 of the scattering particles with @xmath11 or by the regions of soft momenta .",
    "note that the soft and collinear singularities of massless particles ( gauge bosons ) strictly require the definition of a regulator , which is conveniently performed in @xmath12 dimensions . as an immediate consequence of factorization ,",
    "evolution equations emerge , which depend on the kinematics of the specific process and on the chosen regulator .",
    "their solution leads to non - abelian exponentiation , a result which also arises from an effective field theory formulation based on the ultra - violet ( uv ) renormalization properties of effective operators and their anomalous dimensions ; see e.g.  ref .",
    "moreover , for scattering amplitudes in gauge theories , the underlying factorization imposes strong constraints on the anomalous dimensions and the all - order structure of the ir singularities  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we will specialize our investigations in a number of ways .",
    "first , we choose to work in the @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory , which is the simplest non - abelian gauge theory in four dimensions due to the vanishing of the four - dimensional @xmath13 function . in our study",
    ", we are concerned with form factors and scattering amplitudes in this theory , which allows us to study their ir singularities without interference from uv divergences .",
    "second , we will be working in the so - called planar limit and , for scattering amplitudes @xmath14 of @xmath1 external particles , we will assume color ordering .",
    "our main focus is on the study of different kinematical regimes , i.e. scattering amplitudes of massless and massive particles and associated form factors , using different regulator schemes .",
    "the general property of factorization prompts us to ask whether one can delineate a well - defined finite part of @xmath14 independent of the chosen ir regularization . while reasoning along these lines has already been employed in the derivation of radiative corrections for heavy - quark hadroproduction at two loops in qcd  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , this issue is more generally related to the important question whether physical observables in theories with massless particles are independent of the regulator by construction ; see e.g. ref .",
    "; see e.g. the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite . to that end , in this paper we specifically compare dimensional and massive regularizations schemes for @xmath1-particle scattering amplitudes @xmath14 in @xmath0 sym theory , an ideal testing ground for these questions due to the simplicity of its loop expansion .",
    "sym theory , ir - safe inclusive differential cross - sections were studied in ref .",
    "] in - depth studies of the latter may lead to new insights for gauge theories with massive particles which will eventually also be of interest for applications in collider phenomenology .",
    "let us start thus , for simplicity , with maximally - helicity - violating ( mhv ) scattering amplitudes .",
    "factorization implies that the color - ordered amplitude @xmath15 of @xmath1 particles can be written as ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are `` soft '' and `` jet '' functions , respectively , and @xmath19 is an ir - finite `` hard function '' . in general , @xmath20 and @xmath19 are vectors in a space of possible color structures , and @xmath17 is a matrix .",
    "in the planar limit , @xmath17 is proportional to the identity matrix , and one can combine @xmath21 and @xmath22 into a product of `` wedge '' functions @xmath23 that depend only on two adjacent particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the color - ordered amplitude @xcite @xmath26 as will be detailed below , the factorization ( [ intro - factorization2 ] ) holds not only in dimensional regularization , but also in cases where masses are used to partially or fully regulate the ir divergences .",
    "the wedge functions @xmath27 satisfy renormalization group equations which imply that they exponentiate .",
    "the factorization ( [ intro - factorization2 ] ) fixes the hard function @xmath28 only up to finite pieces , but with a suitable definition of the wedge function , we suggest that @xmath29 can be used to define a regulator - independent finite part of the amplitude .    for regulators that leave the external particles massless , such as dimensional regularization in @xmath30 dimensions or the common - mass higgs regulator described below , each wedge has half the ir divergences of a sudakov form factor @xmath31 ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , so it is natural to define @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we show in this paper that , with this definition , @xmath33 is identical for both of these regulators through two - loop order .",
    "we also analyze a refined version of the higgs regulator with differential masses , described below . in this case , the external particles have distinct masses , and so the wedge function can not simply be defined in terms of a sudakov form factor .",
    "instead , we define the one - loop wedge function in terms of a certain ir - divergent triangle diagram , and then use extended dual conformal invariance to extend this to an all - loop expression for the sum of wedge functions . with this choice for the ir - divergent wedge function , we establish that the ir - finite hard function @xmath33 takes precisely the same form for the differential - mass higgs regulator as for the common - mass regulator .",
    "we lack , however , an explicit operator definition for the wedge function in this case .    for @xmath0 sym theory , the regulator - independent hard function @xmath34 takes the simple form @xmath35 due to the conjectured duality between the finite part of the mhv scattering amplitudes and the ( uv renormalized ) expectation value of certain cusped wilson loops ( see refs .",

    "the amplitude is expressed as a function of the dual or region momenta @xmath40 , which are defined by p_i^ = x^_i - x_i+1^ with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the first three terms on the r.h.s . of",
    ", whose kinematical dependence is determined solely by the one - loop contribution @xmath43 , constitute the abdk / bds ansatz  @xcite .",
    "the _ a priori _ undetermined remainder function @xmath44 contains the only non - trivial , i.e. loop - dependent , kinematical dependence",
    ". follows from a conformal ward identity for the dual wilson loop @xcite . the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "of provides a particular solution to this ward identity .",
    "the remainder function @xmath45 is the general homogeneous solution to the ward identity , and depends only on dual conformal cross - ratios , which take the form @xmath46 . due to the absence of dual conformal cross - ratios for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the remainder functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 vanish and therefore the corresponding hard functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are completely determined by their one - loop value and the kinematic - independent functions @xmath53 , and @xmath39 . for @xmath54 ,",
    "dual conformal cross - ratios can be built , and the remainder function is known to be non - zero starting from two loops and @xmath55 external particles @xcite .",
    "its higher - loop and higher - point form is under intense investigation ; see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the planar mhv @xmath1-point amplitude for @xmath0 sym theory has been studied using dimensional regularization and also using an alternative massive ir regulator @xcite .",
    "the latter is motivated by the ads / cft correspondence and consists of computing scattering amplitudes on the coulomb branch of @xmath0 sym theory , i.e. giving a non - trivial vacuum expectation value to some of the scalars .",
    "one can achieve a situation where the propagators on the perimeter of any loop diagram are massive , thereby regulating the ir divergences .",
    "the simplest case , the `` common mass higgs regulator '' in which only one mass @xmath56 is introduced , corresponds to the breaking of the @xmath57 gauge group to @xmath58 , with fields in the adjoint representation of @xmath59 remaining massless .",
    "in the more general `` differential - mass higgs regulator '' , one breaks the gauge group further to @xmath60 , thereby introducing various masses @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "fields in the adjoint of the broken @xmath59 , which appear as external states in the scattering amplitudes , now have nonzero masses @xmath63 .",
    "we use a decomposition of the one - loop mhv @xmath1-point amplitude into a sum of ir - divergent triangle diagrams and ir - finite six - dimensional box integrals to define the sum of one - loop wedge functions as , @xmath10 , and @xmath64 ; see . ] [ sumwedgesoneloop ] _",
    "i=1^n ^ ( ) |_one - loop = _ i=1^n in the uniform small mass limit ( i.e. , @xmath65 , with @xmath66 fixed and @xmath67 ) .",
    "the one - loop hard function @xmath68 is then expressed in terms of ir - finite quantities , and thus is manifestly regulator - independent .",
    "a key point is that the massive regulator is closely connected to dual conformal symmetry .",
    "the higgs masses can be interpreted within the ads / cft duality as the radial coordinates in a @xmath69-dual ads@xmath70 space .",
    "while the isometries of this space yield the usual dual conformal transformations for zero masses , they define a different realization of this symmetry for finite masses , dubbed `` extended dual conformal symmetry '' @xcite .",
    "since no further regulator is needed in the massive setup , the extended dual conformal symmetry is expected to be an exact symmetry of the planar amplitudes .",
    "recently , it was shown that tree - level amplitudes on the coulomb branch of @xmath0 sym and also all cuts of planar loop amplitudes do indeed have this extended symmetry  @xcite . together with the expected cut - constructibility of @xmath0 sym this",
    "then proves the extended dual conformal symmetry property conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "what we wish to emphasize is that , while planar amplitudes have extended dual conformal symmetry , the wedge functions and regulator - independent hard functions separately do not .",
    "this is not surprising , since extended dual conformal transformations act on the masses @xmath10 ( as well as the dual variables @xmath71 ) , whereas the hard function is , by definition , independent of the masses in the uniform small mass limit .",
    "nevertheless , extended dual conformal symmetry can be used to determine the all - loop structure of the ir divergences of scattering amplitudes in the case of the differential - mass higgs regulator . assuming the validity of for mhv scattering amplitudes , together with , we obtain the following expression for the ir - divergent pieces in the differential - mass setup [ sumwedgesintro ] & & _ i=1^n ( ) + & & = _ i=1^n valid for uniform small masses .    having deduced the form of the ir divergences of the amplitude for the differential - mass regulator",
    ", we turn the argument around and use together with extended dual conformal symmetry to deduce the anomalous dual conformal ward identity , from which the all - loop result ( [ solution - ward - identity ] ) follows .",
    "hence , a derivation of from first principles would constitute a proof of without having to rely on the scattering amplitude / wilson loop duality .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand the origin of from a renormalization group approach .",
    "a first step could be to find a suitable operator definition for the wedge function in the differential - mass regulator case .",
    "we leave these questions for future work .",
