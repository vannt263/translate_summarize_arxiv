    "impurities in diamond may form paramagnetic color centers when they introduce defects states in the fundamental band gap .",
    "these defects are of high interest and candidates to realize solid state single photon sources and quantum bits .",
    "the impurities often enter diamond in the growth process of diamond . in this study",
    "we focus our attention to oxygen impurity in diamond .",
    "previous investigations showed @xcite that addition of oxygen precursors in the diamond chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) synthesis process improves the growth speed and the quality of diamond .",
    "the formation of diamond from carbon and hydrogen precursors in the presence of oxygen occurs when the number of oxygen and carbon atoms is about the same according to the c , h , o phase diagram @xcite .",
    "oxygen may enter diamond in this process . as oxygen is a light element and",
    "the natural abundance of its spinless @xmath0 isotope is close to 100% , it is very challenging to observe the fingerprints of oxygen impurity in diamond by vibrational or electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectroscopy techniques .",
    "nevertheless , two esr centers , labeled as war5 and ovh , have been tentatively associated with oxygen - related defects in such cvd samples @xcite .",
    "war5 esr center exhibits @xmath1 spin state with @xmath2 symmetry and anisotropic @xmath3=2.0026(2 ) @xmath4=2.0029(2 ) @xmath5-tensor where @xmath6 and @xmath7 refer to direction parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath8 symmetry axis , respectively .",
    "the measured zero - field - splitting @xmath9 constant@xcite and the hyperfine couplings between the electron spin and proximate @xmath10c nuclear spins ( natural abundance of 1.1%)@xcite was very similar to those of the negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy color center , nv(@xmath11 ) @xcite , in diamond .",
    "as the electronic structure of nv(@xmath11 ) and ov(@xmath12 ) is isovalent , war5 was proposed to originate from ov(@xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "we note that the formation of war5 center was accompanied by a 543.2-nm photoluminescence ( pl ) center @xcite .",
    "however , photoexcitation of the diamond sample containing the war5 esr and 543.2-nm pl centers did not show any spinpolarization of the war5 esr center that does not share the well - known spinpolarization properties of nv(@xmath11 ) center @xcite .",
    "it has been not yet understood whether these esr and pl centers have no common origin or they have common origin but the spinpolarization effect in ov center is negligible for other reasons .",
    "the other oxygen - related ovh esr center has @xmath13 spin state with a characteristic @xmath14h hyperfine signal of @xmath15=@xmath1613.6(1 )  mhz , @xmath17=@xmath189.0(1 )  mhz and @xmath5-tensor of @xmath4=2.0034(1 ) , @xmath3=2.0029(1 ) @xcite .",
    "this esr center was very analogous with the negatively charged nvh(@xmath11 ) esr center @xcite , thus it was proposed that the ovh esr center should originate from the neutral ovh(@xmath12 ) defect because these two defects are isovalent .",
    "in addition , this ovh esr center was annealed out at 1800@xmath19c where nvh(@xmath11 ) defect anneals too @xcite that further strengthens the association of ovh esr center with the ovh(@xmath12 ) defect .",
    "we emphasize that the association of the war5 and ovh esr centers with ov(@xmath12 ) and ovh(@xmath12 ) defects , respectively , seems plausible but no direct evidence of the presence of oxygen impurity has been demonstrated in these two esr centers .",
    "we further note that a series of new cathodoluminescence ( cl ) lines were found in the region of 455.0  nm and 484.1  nm in cvd diamonds where 0.1% o@xmath20 contamination was used in the cvd gas mixture , and they were tentatively associated with oxygen defects @xcite .",
    "the difficulties of identification of oxygen - related defects may be represented by the case of the ok1 @xcite and n3 @xcite esr centers , where these centers were first tentatively assigned to oxygen - related defects in type ib natural diamonds ( see ref .   and references therein ) , however , later it has been shown by further esr and other studies that they are rather related to ti defects @xcite .",
    "oxygen may be introduced by other synthesis techniques .",

    "then cl centers at 330  nm and 267  nm were speculatively assigned to oxygen defects @xcite .",

    "diamonds synthesized in @xmath34 filament with the same temperature and pressure conditions a new @xmath13 esr center was found that was labeled as voh @xcite .",
    "this esr center was fitted with @xmath4=2.0023(1 ) , @xmath3=2.0030(1 ) , and @xmath1535(1 )  mhz , @xmath17=32(1 )  mhz spin - hamiltonian parameters where the hyperfine coupling originates from an @xmath35 nuclear spin with @xmath36100% abundance that was associated with a single @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this esr center clearly differs from the one measured in cvd samples which is labeled as ovh @xcite . in order not to confuse the readers ,",
    "we use only ovh label in the context exclusively for the esr center in cvd samples .",
    "the participation of oxygen impurity in all of these four point defects in the special hpht diamonds was proposed because of the relatively large anisotropy of the @xmath5-factor of the defects .",
    "the anisotropy of the @xmath5-factor was assumed @xcite to originate from the large spin - orbit coupling @xmath38 of the oxygen atom ( @xmath38=151  @xmath39 ) characteristic to this atom type",
    ".    the oxygen may be definitely introduced into diamond by oxygen ion implantation .",
    "oxygen - ion implantation was argued to lead to _ n_-type conduction with activation energy 0.32 ev  in type iia diamond samples,@xcite however , no independent experimental study has yet confirmed this claim .",
    "pl centers associated with oxygen impurity were reported @xcite in natural type iia and ia diamond samples at 584.8 , 598.3 , 845.0 and 836.0  nm after @xmath0 ion - implantation .",
    "these pl centers appeared after annealing at 1500  @xmath40c unlike other pl centers formed by the same bombardments @xcite , nevertheless , the assignment is still speculative .",
    "an unambiguous signal from oxygen - related defect was reported in diamond samples implanted by @xmath41 ions @xcite .",

    "the role of oxygen impurities in diamond is scarce despite the fact that oxygen is presumably introduced in various synthesis processes and can be engineered by oxygen ion implantation . as a first step in understanding of oxygen impurities in diamond ,",

    "the ( @xmath11 ) state is a doublet , albeit its motional averaged hyperfine signal might be complicated .",
    "the h atoms may rotate among the 3 carbon dangling bonds but the rotation of the broken o - c bond may be hindered . as a consequence ,",
    "the resultant hyperfine signal may possess only @xmath75 symmetry .",
    "we show the hyperfine parameters in @xmath75 symmetry in table  [ tab : ovh_hyper ] .    in ovh@xmath21 defect",
    "the three dangling bonds are saturated , thus only the antibonding c - o @xmath107 state appears in the gap .",
    "this defect level is occupied by one electron in the neutral charge state with @xmath13 spin .",
    "the corresponding hyperfine parameters are presented in table  [ tab : ovh_hyper ] .",
    "defects that exhibit jahn - teller distortion may or may not show a high symmetry signal via motional averaging .",
    "this depends on the relative timescales of the microwave field applied to flip the electron spin in the esr measurements and the tunneling between the symmetrically equivalent statically distorted structures .",
    "we first investigate this effect on ovh(@xmath12 ) defect . in @xmath2 symmetry",
    "the h sits in the symmetry axis of which total energy is 0.98  ev higher than that of the @xmath108 distorted geometry .",
    "this @xmath109 energy is called jahn - teller energy . with using the nudge elastic band method @xcite we calculated also the barrier energy for reorientation among the symmetrically equivalent @xmath108 configurations that resulted in 0.93  ev .",
    "this is very close to the calculated jahn - teller energy .",
    "this jahn - teller system may be described as @xmath110 type where @xmath86 now means @xmath86 vibration modes that dynamically drive the system out from @xmath2 symmetry . in this system",
    "the tunneling rate @xmath111 can be calculated ( see section 5.3 in ref . and section 4.3.3 in ref . ) as    @xmath112    [ eq : eqtunnel ]    where @xmath38 is defined by the vibration frequencies of the two modes @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( not degenerate anymore ) participating in the jahn - teller distortion as obtained in the @xmath108 configuration . in this particular system ,",
    "@xmath114=0.18  ev is the bending mode of the c - h bond that reorients the system between two equivalent @xmath108 geometries whereas @xmath113=0.37  ev is the stretching mode of the c - h bond that drives the system through the @xmath2 high symmetry configuration .",
    "in other words , @xmath113 and @xmath114 can be considered as the rotational and radial modes of the potential energy surface of the jahn - teller distorted defect , respectively .",
    "we emphasize here that the values of @xmath113 and @xmath114 are comparable to that of @xmath115 . as a consequence ,",
    "the calculated @xmath111=25.5  thz tunneling rate is about three orders of magnitude faster than the x band at @xmath3610  ghz or the q band at @xmath3634  ghz employed in esr absorption measurements .",
    "we calculated the @xmath115 and the reorientation barrier energy for the nvh(@xmath11 ) defect too , and the calculated values at 0.96  ev and 0.90  ev are very similar to those obtained for ovh(@xmath12 ) defect .",
    "the final result is @xmath116=26.6  thz for nvh(@xmath11 ) .",
    "this also demonstrates the similarities of these two defects and justifies our analysis on ovh(@xmath12 ) defect as nvh(@xmath11 ) defect was already proven to show motional averaged esr signal.@xcite we note that our model takes the full complexity of the potential energy surface into account in the derivation of the tunneling rate , in contrast to a previous approach applied to nvh(@xmath11 ) defect which only considered the radial modes.@xcite    based on these results we expect that all the ovh@xmath117 defects exhibit @xmath2 esr signals because they also possess high c - h vibration frequencies that are comparable with the jahn - teller energy .",
    "we apply a similar analysis on o@xmath71(@xmath85 ) defect too . in this case the high symmetry @xmath80",
    "is distorted to @xmath2 symmetry that can be mediated by @xmath82 quasi - local vibration modes .",
    "the tunneling rate in this @xmath118 system may be calculated @xcite as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the jahn - teller energy and @xmath121 is the corresponding vibration frequency .",
    "the calculated values are 0.76  ev and 0.067  ev , respectively , whereas the reorientation barrier energy is 0.51  ev . despite the calculated jahn - teller and reorientation barrier energies are lower for o@xmath71(@xmath85 ) than those for ovh(@xmath12 ) defect , the calculated @xmath122=0.3  ghz for o@xmath71(@xmath85 )",
    "is much slower than @xmath116 is for ovh(@xmath12 ) .",
    "the reason of this difference is that the energy of the o - c related @xmath82 quasi - local vibration mode is much lower than @xmath120 . as a consequence ,",
    "this rate is much slower than the frequency of the q band ( 34  ghz ) is that was employed in the esr absorption measurements of kul12 esr center , thus the static @xmath2 symmetry was detected .    by comparing the cases of ovh(@xmath12 ) and",
    "o@xmath71(@xmath85 ) it can concluded that by taking only the jahn - teller energies or the reorientation barrier energies can be misleading in the discussion of static versus motional average esr signals of jahn - teller distorted defects but the ratio between the jahn - teller energy and the corresponding vibration energies that lead to the jahn - teller distortion should be considered in the analysis .",
    "in the cvd samples grown with oxygen chemistry a pl center was observed that has a characteristic zero - phonon - line ( zpl ) at 543.2  nm @xcite that corresponds to 2.28  ev .",
    "this 543.2-nm pl center and the war5 esr center were detected in the same diamond sample , thus the 543.2-nm pl center was associated with ov(@xmath12 ) defect @xcite .",
    "as ov(@xmath12 ) is isovalent with nv(@xmath11 ) , the optical spinpolarization of war5 esr center was probed by photoexcitation at a wavelength that could excite the 543.2-nm pl center .",
    "however , no spinpolarization of ov(@xmath12 ) was observed under illumination even at cryogenic conditions .",
    "we study the excited state of ov(@xmath12 ) in details by means of _ ab initio _ calculations , in order to reveal this issue .",
    "the ground state of ov(@xmath12 ) is indeed similar to nv(@xmath11 ) where the @xmath123 orbital is occupied by two electrons by parallel spins forming a @xmath124 ground state .",
    "however , the excited state of the two defects may differ as the number of defect levels in the gap are different for the two defects . in the case of nv(@xmath11 )",
    "the only possible excitation is to promote an electron from the @xmath90 level to the @xmath123 level in the spin minority channel @xcite . in the case of ov(@xmath12 ) one can promote an electron from the @xmath123 level to the @xmath107 level in the spin majority channel or from the @xmath90 level to the @xmath123 level in the spin minority channel .",
    "our calculations predict that the former has lower zpl excitation energy ( 2.34  ev ) than the latter ( 2.67  ev ) by 0.33  ev . according to the kasha - rule the electron from the higher excited state should decay to the lowest excited state rapidly by emitting phonons . although , the symmetry of this excited state is @xmath125 but an antibonding c - o orbital is involved in it and not dangling bonds .",
    "thus , the nature of this excited state significantly differs from that of nv(@xmath11 ) defect .",
    "obviously , the spin - orbit scattering rates from the excited state triplet to the singlet states are not analogous in the two defects .",

    ", the spin - orbit couplings between triplet and the feasible multiplet singlet states do not follow those of nv(@xmath11 ) defect because of the very different nature of the orbitals that build up the many - electron excited state .",

    "the 543.2-nm pl center was observed in cvd diamond samples grown by oxygen chemistry where esr centers associated with ov and ovh defects were observed that we support in our study .",
    "thus , we consider the different charge states of ov defect and hydrogen complexes of ov defects as a candidate for 543.2-nm pl center .",
    "first , we calculate the excitation of ov(@xmath85 ) defect by promoting an electron from the @xmath136 level to the @xmath105 level in the spin minority channel ( see fig .",

    "based on this argument ov(@xmath85 ) is a feasible candidate for the 543.2-nm pl center .",
    "next , we consider the complexes of hydrogen and ov defect .",
    "the ovh(@xmath12 ) exhibits an infrared optical transition . in the positive charge state , the lowest energy excitation",
    "can be described by promoting one electron from the valence band edge to the lowest energy empty @xmath137 level in the gap .",
    "this energy is estimated by the calculated ( @xmath138 ) charge transition level at 2.04  ev .",

    "the calculated ( @xmath138 ) charge transition level of ovh@xmath20 at 2.02  ev may be considered but is again smaller than the experimental data .",
    "we note that this optical transition involves heavy geometry distortion and involvement of phonons in the pl process .",
    "the intra defect level transition energies of ovh@xmath139 are too small to be a reasonable candidate .",
    "finally , the calculated ( @xmath138 ) charge transition level of ovh@xmath21 ( 1.95  ev ) is also too small .    in summary",
    ", we are not able to unambiguously associate any oxygen - related defects with the 543.2  nm pl center observed in cvd diamond grown with oxygen chemistry .",
