    "the @xmath0 charmonium - like state was discovered in 2003 by belle @xcite , as a @xmath5 enhancement in the process @xmath6 .",
    "the same enhancement was then seen in several other experiments as well .",
    "finally , the @xmath0 was also observed in the @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite channels . it is now listed in the pdg tables @xcite , with a mass of @xmath9 mev and a width of @xmath10 mev .",
    "the observed decay modes and helicity analysis indicate positive @xmath11-parity and favour @xmath12 or @xmath13 quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "theoretical work on the @xmath0 comprises a variety of model calculations and interpretations , because of its seeming incompatibility with the standard charmonium spectrum .",
    "let us briefly summarise what we consider the most significant approaches .",
    "trnqvist @xcite : :    calls it a deuson , a deuteron - like @xmath14 bound    state .",
    "binding gets provided by pion exchange .",
    "large isospin breaking    is expected , and so an important @xmath15 decay    mode +    .",
    "bugg @xcite : :    examines a mechanism for resonance capture at thresholds that involves    a threshold cusp interfering constructively with a resonance from    confinement and/or attractive @xmath16 and    @xmath17-channel exchanges .",
    "conclusion : the    @xmath0 requires a virtual state or a resonance +    .",

    "preference for a slightly unbound , virtual    @xmath1+@xmath2    state .",

    "+ kalashnikova & nefediev @xcite : :    analysis from data concludes preference for a dynamically generated    virtual @xmath14 state , with a sizable    @xmath18 @xmath19 component .",
    "+ danilkin & simonov @xcite : :    employs the weinberg eigenvalue method for a model with 1 confinement    and 1 meson - meson channel , coupled via a @xmath20    pair - creation vertex .",
    "two @xmath21 peaks are found ,    i.e. , a narrow one at 3.872  gev and a much broader one at 3.935  gev , a    candidate for the @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath0 is    of a dynamical nature here .",
    "+ bugg @xcite : :    discusses several approaches , including the covalent bond @xcite",
    ".    proposes resonances as linear combinations of @xmath22    and meson - meson .",
    "besides these works , there exists a plethora of exotic models , which nevertheless are incapable of describing the @xmath0 production data .",
    "the resonance - spectrum - expansion ( rse ) @xcite coupled - channel model is designed to describe scattering processes of the form @xmath23 .",
    "although @xmath24 , and @xmath25 can in principle be any structures , we usually consider only non - exotic mesons . between the initial and final meson - meson phase",
    ", there is an intermediate one that we call the confinement phase , and it is built up from an infinite series of @xmath22 states carrying the same  again non - exotic  quantum numbers .    to describe this picture",
    ", we define the effective potential @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the relativistically defined relative momenta of initial channel @xmath29 and final channel @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the spherical bessel function . as free parameters we have @xmath32 , which is an overall coupling constant , and @xmath33 , a parameter mimicking the average string - breaking distance .",
    "the relative couplings @xmath34 between meson - meson channels @xmath29 and @xmath22 recurrences @xmath35 , with discrete energies @xmath36 , are computed with the formalism developed in ref .",
    "the transitions mechanism is the creation / annihilation of @xmath22 pairs , according to the ozi rule , using a spherical dirac - delta potential , which fourier transforms into a spherical bessel function in momentum space .",
    "due to the separable form of potential ( [ veff ] ) , the corresponding @xmath37-matrix is obtained in closed form , via the lippmann - schwinger equation with relativistic kinematics @xcite .",
    "note that the resulting @xmath38-matrix is manifestly unitary and analytic .    in eq .",
    "( [ veff ] ) , we take a harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potential with constant frequency , not only because of its simplicity but also its success in many phenomenological applications ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for references ) .",
    "the corresponding energy levels are + @xmath39",
    "in the present study we assume the @xmath0 to be the @xmath40 @xmath19 state , i.e. , the first radial excitation of the @xmath3 @xcite , with axial - vector ( @xmath12 ) quantum numbers .",
    "then , the most important ozi - allowed decay channels are pseuscalar - vector and vector - vector , shown in table [ mm ] .",
    "note that , for notational simplicity , we have omitted the bars over the anti-@xmath25 mesons .        finally , in fig .",
    "[ tsqp1 ] , right - hand graph , we generate a cusp structure around the @xmath41 threshold , by reducing @xmath32 and so moving pole 2 upwards . while quite illustrative , such a scenario is now excluded by the data .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied the @xmath0 enhancement as the @xmath18 @xmath19 state in the rse coupled - channel model .",
    "the included ozi - allowed channels are capable of reproducing the observed structure in @xmath42 , via a nearby ( virtual ) resonance or virtual - bound - state pole .",
    "however , the present model does not generate any dynamical pole close to the real axis , so that the @xmath4 @xcite  if indeed a @xmath12 state as the @xmath0  remains unexplained .",
    "we are now working @xcite on model extensions , e.g.  by including the probably observed @xcite , ozi - violating @xmath15 decay mode .",
    "we thank the organisers for another great workshop .",
    "we are also indebted to d.  v.  bugg for very useful discussions on the nature of the @xmath0 .",
