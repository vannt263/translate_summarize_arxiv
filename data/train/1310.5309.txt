    "the kapitza ( or dynamical ) stabilization effect refers to the possibility for a classical or quantum particle to be trapped by a rapidly - oscillating potential in cases where the static potential can not @xcite .",
    "it was first explained and demonstrated in classical physics by pyotr kapitza in 1951 , who showed that an inverted pendulum can be stabilized by the addition of a vertical vibration @xcite .",
    "later nonlinear and quantum analogues of this phenomenon were studied in several papers @xcite and found important applications , for example in paul traps for charged particles @xcite , in driven bosonic josephson junctions @xcite , and in nonlinear dispersion management and diffraction control of light in optics @xcite .",
    "the main result underlying kapitza stabilization is that the motion of a classical or quantum particle in an external rapidly oscillating potential can be described at leading order by an effective time - independent potential , which shows a local minimum ( a well ) while the non - oscillating potential did not . while in the classical description the oscillation - induced potential",
    "well introduces a locally - stable fixed point of the motion , in the quantum description stabilization is imperfect since the effective potential does not sustain truly bound states , rather resonance states with a finite lifetime owing to quantum tunneling @xcite .",
    "kapitza stabilization has been studied so far only when the potential is real . in recent years the physics and applications of non - hermitian systems",
    "has received an increasing attention @xcite , especially in the context of @xmath0-symmetric systems @xcite .",
    "such systems possess novel and unexpected physical features .",
    "for instance they can be used for faster - than - hermitian evolution in a two - state quantum system @xcite .",
    "complex potentials can be experimentally realized in different systems , including open two - level atomic systems interacting with near resonant light @xcite and optical structures with gain and loss regions @xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend the problem of the kapitza pendulum to non - hermitian hamiltonians , i.e. to the case of an imaginary rapidly - oscillating potential . in the classical description ,",
    "an `` imaginary '' oscillating inertial force introduces two ( rather than one ) stable fixed points . in the quantum description ,",
    "the quasi - energy spectrum of the hamiltonian turns out to be entirely real - valued in the high - frequency regime . as compared to a real potential , the main distinctive feature here is that the imaginary oscillating potential sustains a truly ( floquet ) bound state instead of a resonance state , i.e. stabilization is perfect for the imaginary oscillating potential while it is imperfect for the real oscillating potential .",
    "we start with a short overview of the classical kapitza - pendulum problem @xcite .",
    "let us consider a rigid pendulum of mass @xmath1 and length @xmath2 , and let us assume that its pivot point is vibrating rapidly in vertical direction , @xmath3 [ see fig .  [ portrait](a ) ] .",
    "the lagrangian of the system in the inertial reference frame is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the kinetic and potential energies , respectively , @xmath6 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath7 is the angle between the pendulum and the @xmath8-axis .",
    "the equation of motion for the angle @xmath7 , as obtained from the euler - lagrange equations , reads = ( g - a^2 t ) .",
    "following the idea of kapitza @xcite , the variable @xmath7 can be written as the sum of fast and slowly - varying variables , namely @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a slowly - varying function over one oscillation cycle and @xmath11 is the rapidly oscillating part .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath12 .",
    "after writing the equation of motion for the `` slow '' component @xmath10 and averaging over the rapid oscillations , we can derive an effective potential @xmath13 for @xmath14 @xcite , [ veffclassical ] v_= m g l ( + ^2 ) .",
    "we see that , for a proper choice of the parameter values , namely for @xmath15 , @xmath13 has two minima , a local minimum at @xmath16 and a global minimum at @xmath17 ; see fig .",
    "[ portrait](b ) .",
    "this result shows that the upper vertical stationary position @xmath16 , which is an unstable point for an ordinary pendulum , can be stabilized when the suspension point of the pendulum vibrates rapidly .",
    "we can generalize the kapitza idea into the complex domain by allowing the underlying potential to become complex - valued .",
    "complex extensions of classical mechanics and the strange dynamics of a classical particle subject to complex forces and moving about in the complex plane have been studied in several works @xcite , especially in the context of @xmath0-symmetric classical mechanics theory @xcite . in our case , we extend the kapitza pendulum into the complex domain by allowing the non - inertial force @xmath18 to become imaginary .",
    "this corresponds to a change of the amplitude @xmath19 of oscillation into @xmath20 , which leads to a flip in the sign of the second term in eq .   and to changing the effective potential @xmath21 .",
    "noticeably , the effective potential remains real - valued in spite of the imaginary non - inertial force .",
    "as compared to the real kapitza pendulum , in the imaginary kapitza pendulum the effective potential has two global minima in the nonintuitive positions @xmath22 , see fig .",
    "[ portrait](c ) .",
    "even though the effective potential for the slow variable @xmath10 is real - valued , the trajectory of @xmath23 occurs in the complex plane owing to the rapidly - varying component @xmath24 , which is imaginary .",
    "an example of such a complex trajectory for the imaginary kapitza pendulum is shown on fig .",
    "[ portrait](d ) .",
    "the figure clearly shows the oscillatory motion in the complex plane around one of the fixed stable points of @xmath21 .",
    "let us now consider the imaginary kapitza pendulum problem in the quantum mechanical framework .",
    "we consider the motion of a quantum particle in a one - dimensional time - dependent potential @xmath25 , which is described by the schrdinger equation ( with @xmath26 ) [ schr ] i _ t ( x , t ) = - _ x x ( x , t ) + v(x , t ) ( x , t ) ( x , t ) ( x , t ) . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the external potential @xmath25 is taken of the form [ eq5 ] v(x , t)=w(x)t , where @xmath27 is assumed to vanish at @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the modulation frequency .     with a gaussian shape ( left ) and effective time - independent potential for ( a ) a real potential , and ( b ) a purely imaginary potential ( right ) .",
    "note that in the latter case the effective potential is a double well .",
    "parameter values are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . ]",
    "similarly to the classical case , in the high modulation regime such a potential can be approximated by an effective time - independent potential @xcite [ vapprox ] v_(x ) ( ) ^2= ( ) ^2 , where the brackets @xmath33 denote time average and the error of this approximation is @xmath34 . if @xmath27 is a real function , then @xmath35 , while if @xmath27 is an imaginary function , then @xmath36 , with @xmath37 as @xmath38 in both cases .",
    "in the first case , because of the quantum tunneling , bound states are unlikely and the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian is continuous @xcite ; only resonance states may exist , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the second case",
    ", however , it is possible to obtain truly bound states .",
    "as an example , let us consider a gaussian potential @xmath27 , [ v ] w(x ) = i v_0 ( -x^2 ) , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are assumed real . according to eq .",
    ", such potential is approximated by the effective time - independent potential [ veff ] v_(x ) -x^2 ^ -2x^2 , we see that , despite the fact that @xmath25 is purely imaginary zero - average potential , the frequency modulation leads to an effective real potential . in fig .",
    "[ potential ] we show schematically the correspondence between a frequency - modulated potential and the effective time - independent potential , both in the case of purely real [ panel ( a ) ] and purely imaginary [ panel ( b ) ] potentials .",
    "we see that in the case of a real potential , the corresponding effective potential is a double barrier , while in the case of an imaginary original potential , the effective potential is a double well . in the former case we have resonance states , whereas in the latter case we have bound states .",
    "from the effective potential description discussed above , we expect the quasi - energy spectrum of the time - periodic hamiltonian @xmath41 to be entirely real - valued at enough high frequencies , despite the hamiltonian is not hermitian . on the other hand , at a low modulation frequency the quasi - energy spectrum is expected to be complex valued . hence a transition from a complex to an entirely real quasi - energy spectrum is expected to occur as the modulation frequency @xmath29 is increased . since the effective potential description disregards terms of the order @xmath34 , it is mandatory to check by a full numerical analysis the transition from a complex to an entirely real quasi - energy spectrum . to numerically compute the quasi - energies @xmath42 of @xmath41 , we look for a solution to eq .   of the form [ eq9 ] ( x , t )",
    "= u(x , t)^-it = _ n",
    "=- n^n u_n(x)^i ( n- ) t , where @xmath43 runs from the @xmath44th harmonic number to the @xmath45th harmonic number . substituting this expression into eq",
    ".   yields ( - n)u_n(x ) = -_x x u_n(x ) + .",
    "the equations above are @xmath46 coupled time - independent equations , which can be treated as an eigenvalues - eigenvectors problem .",
    "they can be solved numerically , for a chosen value of @xmath45 and after discretization in space , in order to obtain the quasi - energies @xmath42 and the harmonic components @xmath47 of the floquet eigenstates . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] we show the numerically - computed quasi - energy spectrum of @xmath41 versus modulation frequency @xmath29 for a gaussian potential @xmath27 [ see eq .  ] for parameter values @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the figure clearly shows the transition from a complex to a real quasi - energy spectrum as the modulation frequency is increased above the threshold value @xmath48 . from the computed floquet eigenstates we also checked the existence of bound states at @xmath49 .",
    "for the parameter values used in the simulations of fig .",

    "[ bound ] we show a plot of the probability function of the zeroth - harmonic component of the floquet bound state for @xmath32 . for comparison , we computed the energy spectrum of the effective time - independent hamiltonian @xmath51 , and found for the double - well effective potential @xmath52 a single bound state , in agreement with the floquet analysis .",
    "the effective - potential treatment gives a very similar distribution of the probability function of the bound state , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bound ] .",
    "it should be noted that , despite the effective potential is a double - well potential , it sustains a single bound state , rather than a couple of bound states as one might expect at first sight .",
    "the reason thereof is that , in order to obtain a real energy spectrum , the frequency @xmath29 needs to be large enough .",
    "since @xmath13 scales as @xmath53 [ see eq .",

    "the idea of kapitza stabilization induced by an oscillating purely imaginary potential , and its distinctive feature as compared to an oscillating real potential ( the hermitian case ) , can find an interesting application and a physical realization in the theory of optical resonators @xcite . in optics and laser physics ,",
    "non - hermitian hamiltonians commonly arise in the description of beam propagation in optical lensguides and resonators with transversely - varying gain and loss media @xcite .",
    "moreover , for short cavities beam propagation in an optical resonator can be mapped into the quantum mechanical schrdinger equation with a potential that is directly related to the mirror profiles @xcite .",
    "the basic idea underlying the optical realization of the quantum mechanical kapitza pendulum is that an optical beam propagating back and forth between two mirrors of an optical resonator mimics the temporal evolution of the wave function of a quantum particle in a potential which is periodically switched between two different values @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in this analogy",
    ", optical diffraction plays the role of the quantum diffusion ( the kinetic energy term in the schrdinger equation ) , whereas the transverse profiles and the transversely varying reflectivity of the two mirrors realize the real and imaginary parts , respectively , of the two potentials @xmath65 and @xmath64 in the quantum problem . for @xmath66 , on average the potential vanishes and basically one retrieves the quantum mechanical formulation of the kapitza pendulum described in the previous section .    to formally clarify such an analogy ,",
    "let us first re - consider the quantum mechanical formulation of the kapitza pendulum with a square - wave ( rather than sinusoidal ) modulation in time of the potential , i.e. let us assume @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the square - wave function with period @xmath69 [ @xmath70 , @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 , and @xmath29 is the modulation frequency . indicating by @xmath75 the floquet eigenstate of the schrdinger equation with quasi energy @xmath42 [ see eq .  ] , it can be readily shown that for a square - wave modulation in time the function @xmath76 satisfies the following equation @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the modulation period , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation is exact and holds for any value of the modulation frequency . in the large modulation frequency limit ,",

    ", after some cumbersome calculations one obtains @xmath87 the effective potential formulation in the high - frequency regime , discussed in the previous sections , is obtained from eq .",
    "after introduction of the new function @xmath88 , which satisfies the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath89 with an effective potential given by @xmath90 note that the form of the effective potential given by eq .   differs from eq .   just for a multiplication factor",
    "the reason thereof is the different temporal modulation of the potential , square wave versus sinusoidal .",
    "let us now outline the optical resonator analogue of the quantum mechanical problem described above .",
    "we consider paraxial light beam propagation at wavelength @xmath91 back and forth between two mirrors of a fabry - perot cavity . like in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume a one transverse dimension , i.e. a slab geometry . in each cavity round trip , the optical field amplitude @xmath92 at a reference plane ( for example at the right mirror plane ) changes because of diffraction in the propagative region between the two mirrors , and because of the reflection from the mirrors",
    ". mirror reflection can introduce a transversely - varying phase ( for non - flat mirrors ) and/or a transversely - varying intensity reflection ( for variable - reflectivity mirrors ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the former case , i.e. perfectly reflecting mirrors with non - flat and generally aspherical surfaces , see fig .  [ fig5](a ) . as it will be shown below",

    "a resonator mode , by definition , is a field distribution @xmath92 that reproduces itself after one cavity round trip , apart from a multiplication factor .",

    "[ fig5](b ) ] .",

    "for aspherical mirrors which are asymptotically flat ( i.e. @xmath129 as @xmath125 ) the resonator turns out to be always unstable , i.e. it does not sustain truly stationary and confined electromagnetic modes , but only leaky modes owing to the shape of the effective potential .",
    "conversely , in the latter case the resonator with variable - reflectivity mirrors can sustain stationary and confined electromagnetic modes , i.e. it is stable .",
    "in this work we have proposed a generalization of the kapitza stabilization effect to imaginary potentials . in the classical case",
    ", it has been shown that an imaginary oscillating inertial force introduces two stable fixed points , which deviate from the usual vertical positions of the pendulum . in the quantum case",
    "we have shown that a frequency - modulated purely imaginary potential may lead to an entire real quasi - energy spectrum of the non - hermitian hamiltonian for a large modulation frequency , with a transition from a complex to a real spectrum as the modulation frequency is increased .",
    "in such a regime we found that floquet bound states can be sustained by an oscillating imaginary potential .",
    "this is a very distinctive feature as compared to the quantum kapitza stabilization in the hermitian case , where stabilization is imperfect and resonance states ( rather than truly bound states ) can be sustained .",
    "an application of the imaginary kapitza pendulum to the stability properties of optical resonators with variable - reflectivity mirrors has been suggested .",
    "our results indicate that stabilization in classical and quantum systems by oscillating potentials show a very distinctive behavior when the potential is allowed to become imaginary , and motivate further studies on the general properties of driven non - hermitian systems .",
