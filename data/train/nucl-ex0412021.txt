    "since 1988 the studies of the @xmath1cd @xmath3 decay have been performed in the solotvina underground laboratory @xcite with the help of cadmium tungstate crystal scintillators ( cdwo@xmath0 ) enriched in @xmath1cd to 83% .",
    "the results obtained in the different phases of these researches have been published earlier @xcite . beginning from 1998 ,",
    "the experiment was carried out in collaboration with the group from the university and infn firenze @xcite .    in the apparatus , which is described in detail in @xcite , four @xmath1cdwo@xmath0 crystals ( total mass 330 g )",
    "were exploited .",
    "they are viewed by a low background 5  phototube ( pmt ) through light - guide @xmath4 cm , which is glued of two parts : quartz ( 25 cm ) and plastic scintillator .",
    "the enriched @xmath1cdwo@xmath0 crystals were surrounded by an active shield made of 15 natural cdwo@xmath0 crystals of large volume with total mass of 20.6 kg .",
    "these are viewed by a pmt through an active plastic light - guide @xmath549 cm .",
    "the whole cdwo@xmath0 array is situated within an additional active shield made of plastic scintillator @xmath6 cm , thus , together with both active light - guides , a complete @xmath2 active shield of the @xmath1cdwo@xmath0 detector was provided . due to the active and passive shields , and as a result of the time - amplitude and pulse - shape analysis of the data , the background rate of @xmath1cdwo@xmath0 detectors in the energy region",
    "@xmath7 mev ( @xmath8 energy of @xmath1cd is 2805 kev ) was reduced to 0.04 counts/(yr kg kev ) .",
    "it is one of the lowest background which has ever been reached with crystal scintillators .",
    "after 14183 h of data taking in the solotvina underground laboratory the half - life limit on @xmath9 decay of @xmath1cd was set as @xmath10 yr at 90% c.l . , which corresponds to an upper bound on the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath11 ev @xcite .",
    "this result is among the strongest world - wide restrictions ( in addition to bounds obtained in experiments with @xmath12ge @xcite , @xmath13se and @xmath14mo @xcite , @xmath15te @xcite , and @xmath16xe @xcite ) .",
    "cdwo@xmath0 crystals possess several unique properties required for a @xmath3 decay experiment : good scintillation characteristics , low level of intrinsic radioactivity , and possibility of pulse - shape discrimination to reduce the background .",
    "to enhance sensitivity of @xmath1cd experiment to the level of neutrino mass @xmath17 ev , one has to increase the measurement time and the mass of enriched @xmath1cdwo@xmath0 , improve the energy resolution and reduce the background of the detector .",
    "as it was shown by monte carlo calculations , the required sensitivity could be achieved by using  150 kg of @xmath1cdwo@xmath0 crystals placed into a large volume of high purity liquid ( cameo project @xcite ) .",
    "the project calls for the background reduction from the current 0.04 counts/(yr kev kg ) to @xmath18 counts/(yr kev kg ) .",
    "to decrease background , the cameo project intends to use @xmath191000 t of high purity water or liquid scintillator ( @xmath19@xmath20 g / g for @xmath21u and @xmath22th ) as a shield for @xmath1cdwo@xmath0 crystals .",
    "due to low density of these liquids , the necessary dimensions of the shields are huge ( @xmath23 m ) .",
    "we propose an alternative solution for a sensitive @xmath3 decay experiment with @xmath1cdwo@xmath0 by using of lead tungstate crystal scintillators as high efficiency @xmath2 active shield .",
    "lead tungstate ( pbwo@xmath0 ) crystal scintillators have been developed as heavy and fast detectors @xcite for high - energy physics experiments .",
    "scintillation characteristics of pbwo@xmath0 have been intensively studied during the last decade @xcite . high registration efficiency to @xmath24 quanta , very good transparency in the region of cdwo@xmath0 emission spectrum at the level of a few meters @xcite , substantial difference of scintillation decay time in comparison with cdwo@xmath0 , well developed tons - scale production @xcite make this material very attractive to build a relatively small yet sensitive experiment to search for @xmath3 decay of @xmath1cd . in this paper",
    "we study the possibility of applying pbwo@xmath0 crystals as material for light - guides and active shield in a @xmath1cd double beta decay experiment with cdwo@xmath0 scintillators .",
