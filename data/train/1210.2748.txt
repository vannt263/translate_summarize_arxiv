    "today s scientific world produces a vastly growing and technology - driven abundance of data across all research fields from observations of natural processes to economic data @xcite . to test or generate hypotheses on interdependencies between processes underlying the data , statistical measures of association are needed . recently ,",
    "reshef _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite put forward two key demands such a measure should fulfill in the bivariate case : ( 1 ) _ generality _ ,",
    "i.e. , the measure should not be restricted to certain types of associations like linear measures , and ( 2 ) _ equitability _ , which means that the measure should reflect a certain heuristic notion of coupling strength , i.e. , it should give similar scores to equally noisy dependencies .",
    "the latter is especially important for comparisons and ranking of the strength of dependencies . in this article",
    "we generalize this idea to multivariate data as needed to reconstruct interaction networks in the fields of neuroscience , genetics , climate , ecology and many more . for the multivariate case",
    "we propose to add two more basic properties : ( 3 ) _ causality _ , which means that the measure should give a non - zero value only to the dependency between lagged components of a multivariate process that are not independent conditional on the remaining process .",
    "( 4 ) _ coupling strength autonomy _ , implying that also for dependent components we seek for a causal notion of coupling strength that is well interpretable , in that it is uniquely determined by the interaction of the two components alone and in a way autonomous of their interaction with the remaining process . to understand this ,",
    "consider a simple example : suppose we have two interacting processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 and a third process @xmath2 , that drives both of them .",
    "then a bivariate measure of coupling strength between @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be influenced by the common input of @xmath2 , while our demand is , that the measure should be autonomous of the interactions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with @xmath2 . in an experimental setting",
    "this corresponds to keeping @xmath2 fixed and solely measuring the impact of a change in @xmath0 on @xmath1 averaged over all realizations of @xmath2 .",
    "this property can be regarded as one ingredient of a multivariate extension of the equitability property .",
    "last , we also demand that the measure should be defined in a way that is _ practically computable _ , in that the estimation does not , e.g. , require somewhat arbitrary truncations like in the case of transfer entropy @xcite . due to these properties",
    "our approach can be used to reconstruct interaction networks where not only the links are causal , but are also meaningfully weighted and have the attribute of a coupling delay .",
    "this serves as an important feature in inferring physical mechanisms from interpreting interaction networks .        the first requirement , generality , is fulfilled by any information theoretic measure like mutual information ( mi ) and conditional mutual information ( cmi ) @xcite . these measures also fulfill the axioms for dependency measures proposed in @xcite . additionally to generality",
    ", the authors in @xcite demonstrate that their algorithmically motivated maximal information coefficient fulfills the property of equitability . however , apart from issues with statistical power @xcite , a crucial drawback of their measure is , that it is not clear how to extend it to the multivariate case .",
    "there are few works considering a concept of coupling strength in the multivariate context of causality . in @xcite this problem",
    "is approached in the linear framework of partial directed coherence and in @xcite using the less restricted , yet still model - based , concept of granger causality , all sharing the problem that the model might be misspecified .",
    "transfer entropy ( te ) @xcite is the information - theoretic analogue of granger causality @xcite and the issue of arbitrary truncations has been addressed in @xcite and in our previous article @xcite .",
    "still the problem with te is that it is not lag - specific which can lead to false interpretations like in the case of feedbacks @xcite and , as we will demonstrate analytically and numerically in this article , it is _ not _ uniquely determined by the interaction of the two components alone and depends on misleading effects of , e.g. , autodependency and the interaction with other processes . in essence , it does not fulfill the proposed property of coupling strength autonomy . in @xcite another information - theoretic approach , based on a different set of postulates ,",
    "is discussed .",
    "our approach to a measure of a causal coupling strength is based on the fundamental concept of _ source entropy _ @xcite and for the special case of bivariate ordinal pattern time series the _ momentary information transfer _ ( mit ) has been introduced recently in @xcite . in this article",
    "we utilize the concept of graphical models to mathematically formalize and generalize mit to the multivariate case .",
    "we demonstrate that mit is practically computable and fulfills the properties of generality , causality and coupling strength autonomy , while the more complex property of equitability will only partially be addressed here .",
    "the determination of a causal coupling strength in our approach is a two - step process . in the first step",
    "the graphical model is estimated as detailed in @xcite which determines the existence or absence of a link and thus of a causality between lagged components of the multivariate process .",
    "the second step  the main topic of the present paper  is the estimation of mit as a meaningful weight for every existing link in the graph .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : te ] we define and review te and the _ decomposed transfer entropy _ introduced in @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sect : graph ] we introduce the important concept of graphical models and in sect .",
    "[ sect : mit ] we define mit and related measures .",
    "all of these measures are compared analytically ( sect .",
    "[ sect : analytics ] ) , leading to the coupling strength autonomy theorem ( sect .",
    "[ sect : coupling_independence ] ) , and numerically ( sect .",
    "[ sect : numerics ] ) . finally , we discuss limitations ( sect .",
    "[ sect : limitations ] ) and provide an application to climatological data that shows the potential of our approach ( sect .  [ sect : application ] ) .",
    "the appendices provide proofs and further discussions .",
    "before introducing mit , we will discuss the well - known te and its short - comings .",
    "we will focus on multivariate time series generated by discrete - time stochastic processes and use the following notation : given a stationary multivariate discrete - time stochastic process",
    "@xmath3 , we denote its uni- or multivariate subprocesses @xmath4 and the random variables at time @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "their _ pasts _ are defined as @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for convenience ,",
    "we will often treat @xmath3 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 as sets of random variables , so that , e.g. , @xmath12 can be considered a subset of @xmath10 .",
    "now the te [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : graph_te_dte](a ) ] @xmath13 is the reduction in uncertainty about @xmath14 when learning the past of @xmath15 , if the rest of the past of @xmath9 , given by @xmath16 , is already known ( where `` @xmath17 '' denotes the subtraction of a set ) . note that , because of the assumed stationarity , @xmath18 is independent of @xmath5 . te measures the aggregated influence of @xmath0 at all past lags and is not lag - specific .",
    "the definition of te leads to the problem that infinite - dimensional densities have to be estimated , which is commonly called the `` curse of dimensionality '' . in the usual naive estimation of te the infinite vectors are simply truncated at some @xmath19 leading to @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( correspondingly for @xmath3 ) and @xmath19 has to be chosen at least as large as the maximal coupling delay between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which can lead to very large dimensions . in our numerical experiments we will demonstrate that the choice of a truncation lag @xmath19 , which affects the estimation dimension via @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the number of processes ) , has a strong influence on the value of te and affects the reliability of causal inference .",
    "this is a huge disadvantage because the coupling delay should not have an influence on the measured coupling strength .    in @xcite the problem of high dimensionality",
    "is overcome by utilizing the concept of graphical models that will be introduced in the next section . in this framework",
    "a decomposed transfer entropy ( dte ) is derived that enables an estimation using finite vectors @xmath24 for a certain _ finite _ set @xmath25 [ see fig .  [ fig : graph_te_dte](b ) ] and with @xmath26 chosen as the smallest @xmath27 for which the estimated remainder is smaller than some given threshold .",
    "another approach to find a truncation is described in @xcite .",
    "while thereby the somewhat arbitrary truncation lag @xmath19 is avoided and the estimation dimension is drastically reduced , it can still be quite high ( in the still rather simple model example of @xcite the maximum dimension was 24 ) .",
    "the summands in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) can be seen as the contributions of different lags to te , but should not be interpreted as lag - specific causal contributions because they can be non - zero also for lags @xmath27 for which there is no link in the graph . finally ,",
    "apart from the issue of high dimensionality and lag - specific causality , we will demonstrate in sect .",
    "[ sect : analytics ] that te or dte also do not fulfill the proposed coupling strength autonomy property . in the next section",
    "we introduce the important concept of graphical models from which we derive mit and related measures .     at time",
    "@xmath5 ( omitting @xmath5 and @xmath27 in the labels ) as a segmented column bar .",
    "it is composed of the source entropy @xmath28 ( dark gray shaded ) and parts of the source entropy @xmath29 ( light gray shaded ) , the entropy @xmath30 of the parents of @xmath0 ( red ) , and the entropy @xmath31 of the remaining parents of @xmath1 ( blue ) .",
    "our cmi @xmath32 ( solid framed segment ) is the difference between the entropy @xmath33 ( dashed segment ) that includes transfer from @xmath0 and the source entropy of @xmath1 that excludes it .",

    "in the graphical model approach @xcite the conditional independence properties of a multivariate process are visualized in a graph , in our case a time series graph .",
    "this graph thus encodes the lag - specific causality with respect to the observed process . as depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : graph_te_dte ] and [ fig : entropy_flow](b ) , each node in that graph represents a single random variable , i.e. , a subprocess , at a certain time @xmath5 . nodes @xmath34 and @xmath14 are connected by a directed link `` @xmath38 '' pointing forward in time if and only if @xmath39 and @xmath40 i.e. , if they are not independent conditionally on the past of the whole process , which implies a lag - specific causality with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath41 we say that the link `` @xmath42 '' represents a _ coupling at lag _",
    "@xmath27 , while for @xmath43 it represents an _ autodependency at lag _",
    "@xmath27 . nodes @xmath15 and @xmath14 are connected by an undirected contemporaneous link ( visualized by a line ) @xcite if and only if @xmath44 where also the contemporaneous present @xmath45 is included in the condition . in the case of a multivariate autoregressive process as defined later in eq .",
    "( [ eq : var ] ) , this definition corresponds to non - zero entries in the _ inverse _ covariance matrix of the innovations @xmath46 . note that stationarity implies that `` @xmath42 '' whenever `` @xmath47 '' for any @xmath48 .    like te , the cmis given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_graph ] ) and ( [ eq : def_graph_contemp ] ) involve infinite - dimensional vectors and can thus not be directly computed , but only involving truncations . as shown in sect .",
    "[ sect : numerics ] , this measure therefore suffers from the problem of high dimensionality and also theoretically does not fulfill the coupling strength autonomy property as analyzed in sect .",
    "[ sect : analytics ] .    on the other hand , one can exploit the markov property and use the finite set of _ parents _ defined as @xmath49 of @xmath14 [ blue box in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy_flow](b ) ] which separate @xmath14 from the past of the whole process @xmath50 .",
    "the parents of all subprocesses in @xmath3 together with the contemporaneous links comprise the time series graph . in @xcite an algorithm for the estimation of these time series graphs by iteratively inferring the parents is introduced . in the supplementary material of @xcite",
    "we also describe a suitable shuffle test and a detailed numerical study on the detection and false positive rates of the algorithm .",
    "the markov properties hold for models sufficing the very general condition(s ) in @xcite .",
    "the determination of a causal coupling strength now is a two - step procedure . in the first step",
    "the time series graph is estimated as detailed in @xcite which determines the existence or absence of a link and thus of a causality between lagged components of @xmath3 .",
    "the second step is the determination of a meaningful weight for every existing link in the graph .",
    "the mit introduced in the next section is intended to serve this aim by attributing a well interpretable coupling strength solely to the inferred links of the time series graph .",
    "the parents of a subprocess @xmath1 at a certain time @xmath5 are key to understand the underlying concept of source entropy .",
    "each univariate subprocess @xmath0 of a stationary multivariate discrete - time stochastic process @xmath3 will at each time @xmath5 yield a realization @xmath51 .",
    "the entropy of @xmath15 measures the uncertainty about @xmath51 before its observation , and it will in general be reduced if a realization of the parents @xmath52 is known .",
    "but for a non - deterministic process , and most real data will at least contain some random noise , there will always be some `` surprise '' left when observing @xmath51 .",
    "this surprise gives us information and the expected information is called the source entropy @xmath53 of @xmath0 .",
    "now the mit between @xmath0 at some lagged time @xmath54 in the past and @xmath1 at time @xmath5 is the cmi that measures the part of source entropy of @xmath1 that is shared with the source entropy of @xmath0 : @xmath55 this approach of `` isolating source entropies '' is sketched in a venn diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy_flow](a ) .",
    "the attribute _ momentary _ @xcite is used because mit measures the information of the `` moment '' @xmath54 in @xmath0 that is transferred to @xmath14 .",
    "this `` momentariness '' is closely related to the property of coupling strength autonomy as we will show in the next sections .",
    "similarly to the definition of contemporaneous links in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_graph_contemp ] ) , we can also define a contemporaneous mit @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the contemporaneous neighbors given by @xmath58 and correspondingly for @xmath0 and their parents .",
    "due to markov properties the contemporaneous mit is equivalent to the formula defining contemporaneous links eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_graph_contemp ] ) .",
    "this is , however , not the case for the lagged mit . like any ( c)mi",
    ", mit is sensitive to any kind of statistical association and therefore guarantees the property of generality .",
    "because mit uses the parents @xmath59 as conditions , it also fulfills the property of lag - specific causality in that it is non - zero only for lagged processes that are not independent conditional on @xmath60 .    as related measures",
    ", we can also choose either one of the parents as a condition , which  dropping the attribute `` momentary ''  leads to the _ information transfers _ ity and itx @xmath61 ity isolates only the source entropy of @xmath1 .",
    "like mit it is non - zero only for dependent nodes ( and therefore fulfills the properties of generality and causality ) and used in the algorithm to estimate the time series graph @xcite .",
    "itx measures the part of source entropy in @xmath62 that reaches @xmath14 on any path and is , thus , not a causal measure , yet in many situations we might only be interested in the effect of @xmath0 on @xmath1 , no matter how this influence is mediated . for @xmath39 these three cmis",
    "are related by the inequality @xmath63 which holds under the `` no sidepath''-constraint as specified in sect .",
    "[ sect : coupling_independence ] . the proof is given in the appendix .",
    "the very definition of mit , ity and itx already leads to a low - dimensional estimation problem without arbitrary truncation parameters .",
    "further , the underlying theory of time series graphs allows for an analytical evaluation of the properties of these measures as we will demonstrate in the following section .",
    "see for software to compute the time series graph , mit and related measures .    to clarify , each of the cmis introduced in the preceding sections are intended to measure a different aspect of the coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the following analytical analysis of simple models",
    "we will discuss the interpretability of the different measures .",
    "to motivate our choice of a measure of coupling strength and to clarify the important coupling strength autonomy property , we discuss an analytically tractable model of a multivariate gaussian process : @xmath64 with independent gaussian white noise processes @xmath65 with variances @xmath66 .",
    "the corresponding time series graph is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph_te_dte ] and the parents are @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "generally , the conditional entropy @xmath69 of a @xmath70-dimensional gaussian process @xmath1 conditional on a ( possibly multivariate ) process @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the determinant of the covariance matrix of @xmath74 . in our case",
    "@xmath1 is univariate and thus @xmath75 .",
    "the variances and covariances needed to evaluate the determinants and detailed derivations for the following formulas are given in the appendix .",
    "first , we analyze te given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_te ] ) .",
    "te can be written as the difference of conditional entropies @xmath76 where the latter entropy , conditioned on the whole infinite past , is actually the source entropy of @xmath1 and can be much easier computed by exploiting the markov property @xmath77 which yields , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond_ent ] ) , @xmath78 the source entropy of @xmath1 is therefore given by the entropy of the innovation term @xmath79 .",
    "in the first entropy term , on the other hand , the infinite vector can not be treated that easily and we have to evaluate the determinants of infinite dimensional matrices in @xmath80 however , for the special case of @xmath81 , i.e. , no input processes apart from the autodependency in @xmath0 , the quotient of these matrices can be simplified to the quotient of infinite toeplitz matrices . as shown in the appendix",
    ", we can then apply szeg s theorem @xcite and get @xmath82 another tractable case is @xmath83 for which the blocks of the covariance matrix @xmath84 become diagonal and @xmath85 thus , in the first case the value of te for our model depends on the autodependency coefficient and in the second case on the coupling coefficient and variance of @xmath2 .",
    "but why should a measure of coupling strength between @xmath0 and @xmath1 depend on internal dynamics of @xmath0 and , even more so , on the interaction of @xmath0 with another process @xmath2 ?",
    "while it can be information - theoretically explained , it seems rather unintuitive for a measure of coupling strength between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "next , we compute the cmi @xmath86 that defines links in a time series graph .",
    "writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_graph ] ) for @xmath35 as a difference of conditional entropies , the second term is again the source entropy as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ana_model_source ] ) and in this case also the first entropy can be simplified using the markov property @xmath87 to arrive at a finite covariance matrix from which a lengthy computation yields @xmath88 again , also this measure of coupling strength depends on the coefficients belonging to other coupling and autodependency links .",
    "we now turn to the measures that solely use the parents as conditions which has the analytical and numerical advantage of low dimensional computations .",
    "the resulting expressions for the cmi with no conditions , i.e. , the mutual information ( mi ) , and for either one of the parents as a condition for @xmath35 are @xmath89 thus mi depends on the coefficients and variances of the input processes , while itx and ity still depend at least on the coefficient and variance of the process that is not conditioned on .",
    "contrary to te and link though , neither of the three measures depends on the interaction with @xmath2 . in our model",
    "the inputs to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. , the autodependency with @xmath90 and the external input from @xmath91 , are independent which makes the formulas much simpler .    finally , the mit for @xmath35 is @xmath92 which solely depends on the model coefficients that govern the source entropies , i.e. , the variances @xmath93 , and the coupling coefficient @xmath94 .",
    "this equation can be proven to hold for arbitrary multivariate linear autoregressive processes under the `` no sidepath''-constraint specified in the next section .",
    "more generally , for a class of additive models mit depends only on the coupling coefficient @xmath94 and the source variances of @xmath95 and @xmath79 as will be proven in the coupling strength autonomy theorem in the next section .    .",
    "black dots mark @xmath34 and @xmath14 , the red and blue boxes their parents . ( a ) a sidepath , i.e. , if there exists a path from @xmath96 to some parent of @xmath14 . then the coupling can not be related to one single link , but additionally to the path via @xmath91 .",

    "the entropies of @xmath97 and its parents `` mix '' and the coupling should be considered as emanating from @xmath98 rather than @xmath97 alone . ]    but can a coupling strength always be associated with only one coupling coefficient @xmath94 ? in the following  still linear  example model visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : sidepath_nonlinear](a ) this is not the case : @xmath99 where the influence of @xmath96 on @xmath14 has two paths : one via the direct coupling link `` @xmath100 '' and one via the path `` @xmath101 '' such that we can rewrite @xmath102 from which we see , that the coupling can not be unambiguously related to one coefficient . here ,",
    "mit at @xmath35 is @xmath103 and depends not only on @xmath94 , but also on the coefficient @xmath104 of the link `` @xmath105 '' , and on the variance of @xmath106 . in this case",
    "it might be more appropriate to `` leave open '' both paths and exclude @xmath91 from the conditions which  only in this case  reduces the modified mit to the mi @xmath107 here the sum @xmath108 is the covariance along both paths , which can also vanish for @xmath109 , and seems like a more appropriate representation of the coupling between @xmath96 and @xmath14 .",

    "<S> mit is based on the fundamental concept of source entropy , which we utilize to yield a notion of coupling strength that is , compared to mutual information and transfer entropy , well interpretable , in that for many cases it solely depends on the interaction of the two components at a certain lag . in particular , mit is thus in many cases able to exclude the misleading influence of autodependency within a process in an information - theoretic way . </S>",
    "<S> we formalize and prove this idea analytically and numerically for a general class of nonlinear stochastic processes and illustrate the potential of mit on climatological data . </S>"
