    "<S> recent experiments on the electroproduction of @xmath0 at jlab has drawn attention because the data from the experiment cover a wide range of the photon momentum transfer @xmath2 at high energy @xmath5 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . analyses of electroproduction data have shown that the cross sections of the process are largely determined by the pion and the nucleon electromagnetic form factors that include information about the hadron structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , electroproduction plays a role not only in understanding the production mechanism but also in testing various sorts of form factors originating either from phenomenological or from some theoretical basis on quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one interesting feature of the process is that empirical data at large momentum transfer @xmath2 and high energy @xmath5 require a large contribution of the @xmath6-channel proton pole to the transverse cross section @xmath7 in order to reproduce a set of four separated differential cross sections , @xmath8 in a consistent manner . </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal cross section @xmath9 follows the pion - pole dominance with the form factor @xmath10 of a monopole type from @xmath11-meson dominance , as expected from @xmath12 for an enhancement of @xmath6-channel exchange , therefore , in the regge model for @xmath13-channel meson exchange , kaskulov and mosel ( km ) @xcite introduced an @xmath6-dependence of the charge form factor @xmath14 to the proton pole term to implement the contributions of the @xmath15 resonances based on the bloom - gilman duality @xcite , i.e. , @xmath16 which results in eq . ( 43 ) of ref . </S>",

    "<S> 6 , however , the validity of such form factors of proton in these works are questionable for the large @xmath3 region , which is particularly true for very recent data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in this work we investigate the process @xmath18 based on an extension of our previous works @xcite to electroproduction . </S>",
    "<S> our purpose here is to find another set of possible parameters for the pion and the proton charge form factors to fit the cross sections . avoiding complications in the parameterization of the proton charge form factor as in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kmff ] ) and ( [ vrff ] ) , we reconsider the proton form factor of a simple dipole type as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vrff ] ) , but now it has a constant cutoff mass that can be adjusted . </S>",

    "<S> , we have used the gross - riska prescription @xcite for proton and pion charge form factors to constrain the respective longitudinal components from coupling to virtual photon . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ piff0 ] ) , common to all models , should be different from one another for an agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the km model divides the cutoff mass into three parts : @xmath38 gev for @xmath74 gev@xmath4 , 0.63 gev for @xmath75 gev@xmath4 , and 0.68 gev for @xmath76 gev@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the vr model fixed @xmath40 gev , regardless of the @xmath2 range with a smaller coupling constant @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath36 gev for the desy data and @xmath78 gev for the jlab data with the coupling constants concerning @xmath48 and @xmath11 being the same as those of the km model .    </S>",

    "<S> therefore , the differences between the models are basically the differences of the proton form factors together with the cutoff @xmath55 , as discussed above . in this analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we fix the cutoff mass @xmath37 gev over whole range of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the proton form factor in eq . </S>",

    "<S> the km form factor would yield @xmath81 gev in the limit of @xmath82 , as estimated in correspondence with the same form factor for the vm model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , all the cutoff masses for the proton form factors in these models are almost two times larger than the @xmath83 gev fitted to the on - shell form factor from experimental data , suggestive of an @xmath15 contribution or an off - shell effect in the @xmath6-channel .     </S>",

    "<S> the change in @xmath55 due to a variation of @xmath2 can be understood as a change in the measurement of the charge radius of pion , @xmath86 which reads @xmath87 fm@xmath4 for @xmath36 gev and @xmath89 fm@xmath4 for @xmath78 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this is sensible because the size of the pion will increase with higher resolution as @xmath2 increases .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the present model with cutoff masses consistent with desy and jlab data , we analyze the unseparated cross section @xmath90 at the high @xmath2 and large @xmath3 region . </S>",

    "<S> [ clasdsdtu ] that the contribution of @xmath11 exchange becomes noticeable in this kinematical region . </S>",
