    "the gaseous ecosystems around nearby galaxies are thought to be rich and dynamic , reflecting a wide variety of processes associated with galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "theoretical arguments predict that galaxies can continually accrete gas from their surroundings , as material falls in from the more diffuse intragroup medium ( e.g. ,  larson 1972 ; maller & bullock 2004 ; kere et  al .  2005 ;",
    "sommer - larsen 2006 ) .",
    "massive galaxies can host a significant population of gas - rich dwarf companions , and interactions with these companions and with larger nearby galaxies can imprint kinematic and morphological signatures in the extended hi disks , such as disk warps , hi plumes and tidal tails , and high velocity cloud complexes ( see compilations in hibbard et  al .",
    "2001 ; sancisi et  al .",
    "radially extended gas is responsive to even low - level perturbations , and this makes deep hi imaging an excellent tool to pinpoint subtle dynamical effects that are missed in the optical , and that help drive galaxy evolution .",
    "galaxies are believed to be embedded in a gaseous network which can feed galaxies through accretion . at high redshift",
    ", this accretion is thought to be rapid , perhaps in a  cold \" accretion mode where gas flows smoothly onto galaxies along dense dark matter filaments , never shock heating to the virial temperature of the host dark matter halo ( e.g. ,  kere et  al .",
    "2005 , 2009 , dekel & birnboim 2006 , stewart et  al .",
    "however , under these models , the fraction of cold gas accretion plummets once the dark matter halo reaches a critical mass @xmath10 ( dekel & birnboim 2006 ) . at the present epoch ,",
    "therefore , the accretion of gas onto massive galaxies may happen either via  hot mode \" accretion , where gas cools from a surrounding hot halo , or by the accretion of smaller gas - rich companion galaxies .",
    "of course , these scenarios are not mutually exclusive , as several accretion processes may be operating simultaneously . the exact mechanism driving gas accretion onto galaxies at low redshift  whether it be hot mode , vestigial cold mode , or satellite accretion ",
    "remains unclear .",
    "searches for signatures of gas accretion have shown a very complex hi environment around nearby galaxies . on large scales , hi tails , plumes , warps , and lopsidedness certainly argue that ongoing accretion is triggered by interactions and mergers ( see sancisi et  al .",
    "2008 for a review ) . in many cases ,",
    "the clear culprit is a companion galaxy tidally stripping and/or being stripped the host galaxy .",
    "in contrast , searches for pure  starless \" hi clouds in the intragroup medium that might drive gaseous accretion have yielded few detections ( e.g. ,  de blok et  al .  2002 ;",
    "kova et  al .",
    "2009 ; chynoweth et  al .  2009",
    "; pisano et  al .  2007 , 2011 ) .",
    "while strongly interacting groups can host a population of massive free - floating hi clouds ( such as those found in the m81/m82 group ; chynoweth et  al .",
    "2008 ) , the clouds are typically linked to the more diffuse tidal debris and have a phase space structure consistent with a tidal formation scenario , rather than being fresh material accreting from the intragroup medium or being `` dark galaxies '' hosted by their own dark matter halo ( chynoweth et  al",
    ".  2011a ) .",
    "in short , despite solid theoretical evidence that galaxies should accrete gas from the intergalactic medium , or draw from the warm gas reservoir in the halo , most of the observed hi structures are consistent with interaction with or accretion from another gas - rich galaxy .",
    "the ubiquity of tidal interaction signatures in the hi distribution around nearby galaxies is easily understood by the radially extended nature of the neutral interstellar medium in galaxies . because gas at large radius is less tightly bound to its host galaxy than is the more concentrated stellar component , it is _ more _ responsive to tidal perturbations , and can reveal interaction signatures even in systems which show little or no direct evidence of tidal debris in the optical , such as the leo ring around the m96 group ( schneider 1985 ; michel - dansac et  al .",
    "2010 ) , the tidal features connecting galaxies in the m81/m82 system ( yun et  al .",
    "1994 ) , or the tidal tail in the leo triplet , first detected in hi ( haynes et  al .  1979 ) .",
    "beyond simply identifying interacting systems , the morphology and kinematics of the hi tidal debris can be used to develop detailed dynamical models of the interaction ( e.g. ,  hibbard & mihos 1995 ; yun 1999 ; michel - dansac et  al .",
    "2010 ; barnes 2011 )    the nearby m101 galaxy group ( tully 1988 ) provides an opportunity to study the connection between the group hi environment and the properties of the individual galaxies .",
    "m101 itself is a well - studied , massive sc galaxy , and its highly asymmetric disk suggests ongoing interactions with other galaxies within the group ( beale & davies 1969 ; waller et  al .",
    "previous 21-cm neutral atomic hydrogen ( hi ) imaging of m101 , both single dish and synthesis mapping , has shown a complex hi environment : a distorted hi disk with several high velocity cloud complexes ( van der hulst & sancisi 1988 , hereafter vdhs88 ; walter et  al .",
    "2008 ) , and an extended , asymmetric outer hi plume at lower column density ( huchtmeier & witzel 1979 , hereafter hw79 ] ) .",

    "2012 ) and extended uv emission ( thilker et  al .",

    "in this paper we survey the neutral hydrogen content of the m101 group using the 100 m robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) at the nrao in green bank , west virginia . compared with previous single - dish 21-cm studies of m101 ( hw77 ) ,",
    "our survey is wider in area , more sensitive , and covers a wider velocity range .",
    "our data is complementary to hi synthesis maps of galaxies in the m101 group by probing the more extended , low column density hi surrounding the galaxies .",
    "we use the data to search for isolated hi clouds in the m101 group , to identify any signatures of hi accretion onto m101 , to probe the kinematics of the diffuse hi around m101 , and to search for any extended hi that might trace a past interaction between m101 and any of its companions .",
    "we observed the m101 galaxy group using the gbt auto - correlation spectrometer using 9-bit sampling .",
    "the observations were carried out in 20 sessions between 2011 january and april .",
    "we observed the inner 2@xmath0 @xmath1 1.5@xmath0 region surrounding m101 more sensitively than the outer regions of the galaxy group , in order to search more deeply for hi features . to survey the entire m101 group ,",
    "we moved the telescope in a  basket - weave \" pattern with 3@xmath11 offsets between each scan and sampled every 3@xmath11 at an integration time of 2 s per sample .",
    "this sampling interval corresponds to a slightly better - than - nyquist rate at approximately 3 pixels per beam .",
    "total integration time was approximately 86 hr .",
    "table [ m101obs ] gives a summary of the observations , including the rms noise figures .",
    "we calibrated the gbt data in the standard manner using the gbtidl and aips data reduction packages . a short observation of a discrete reference position outside the map of the galaxy group bracketed 14 hr sections of integration time .",
    "we averaged the reference position observations bracketing each section of data to construct an average reference spectrum for that section , and used the reference spectrum to perform a standard ( signal - reference)/reference calibration of each pixel .",
    "spectra were then smoothed from their native resolution of 3.1 khz to a channel spacing of 24.4 khz , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 5.2 km s@xmath12 across the 12.5 mhz bandwidth . this spectral smoothing balances",
    "the need for sensitivity , which is increased with more spectral smoothing , with the need to resolve possible narrow line - width hi features .",
    "the calibrated spectra were scaled by the system temperature ( typically about 20 k for these observations ) , corrected for atmospheric opacity and gbt efficiency .",
    "we adopted the gbt efficiency equation ( 1 ) from langston & turner ( 2007 ) with a zenith atmospheric opacity of @xmath13 = 0.009 and a zenith efficiency of @xmath14 = 0.71 .",
    "the frequency range observed was relatively free of radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) , with less than 0.5% of all spectra adversely affected .",
    "the spectra exhibiting rfi were identified by tabulating the rms noise level in channels free of neutral hydrogen emission .",
    "spectra that showed high rms noise across many channels were flagged and removed .",
    "narrow - band rfi also adversely affected a small number of channels , which were blanked from the datacube .",
    "the data were then gridded using the aips task sdimg , which also averages polarizations .",
    "we used a gaussian - tapered bessel convolving function for gridding as described in mangum et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , with parameters found empirically to maximize the map sensitivity without degrading resolution ( f. j. lockman , private communication ) . after amplitude calibration and gridding ,",
    "continuum sources were subtracted by fitting and subtracting a first - order polynomial to line - free regions of the spectra .",
    "only channels in high negative velocity ranges , where few or no sources are expected , were used for the fit .",
    "this simple baseline fit was extrapolated to the positive velocity range , where galaxies and unknown hi features make a baseline fit unreliable .",
    "the effective angular resolution , determined from maps of 3c286 , is 9.15@xmath15 0.05 corresponding to a physical resolution of 18.7 kpc . to convert to units of flux density , we observed the calibration source 3c286 , whose flux density is 14.57 @xmath15 0.94 jy at 1.418 ghz ( ott et  al .",
    "the calibration from k to jy was derived by mapping 3c286 in the same way as the hi maps were produced .",
    "after all corrections for the gbt efficiency and the mapping process , the scale factor from k beam@xmath12 to jy beam@xmath12 images is 0.49 .",
    "the rms uncertainty varies across the field due to differing integration times ; in the inner region around m101 itself , the rms noise is @xmath5 3 mjy beam@xmath12 , while in the outer region the noise is a factor of five larger , @xmath5 15 mjy beam@xmath12 .",
    "these noise levels correspond to a limiting column density for the dataset of @xmath16 = 16.8 and 17.5 in the inner and outer regions , respectively . to calculate a characteristic hi mass sensitivity",
    ", we assume that low mass clouds will be unresolved in our beam , and use the relation    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the distance to m101 in mpc , @xmath19 is the rms noise in one channel , and @xmath20 is the channel width . for our adopted distance of @xmath21 mpc , we obtain a @xmath22 sensitivity per 5.2 km  s@xmath12  channel of @xmath23  in the inner region of our map and @xmath24  in the outer region .",
    "however , in searching for discrete hi emission , we used more conservative detection limits ( described below ) to ensure valid detections .",
    "to systematically survey the m101 group for hi emission , we extract a spectrum for each spatial pixel , masking out velocity channels in the range @xmath25 km  s@xmath12 , which are dominated by diffuse galactic emission , and channels in the range @xmath26 km  s@xmath12 , which were contaminated by narrowband rfi . in each spectrum , we then search for emission that is @xmath27 above the noise level in three adjacent velocity channels , with at least one channel having peak emission of @xmath28 .",
    "objects detected this way are thus detected at a @xmath29 level integrated over three channels .",

    "2009 ) of the field , shown in figure  [ newimages ] , to characterize the morphology and colors of the optical counterpart .",

    "its very blue colors ( see table [ newprops ] ) and knotty appearance are characteristic of a star forming dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. ,  van zee 2001 ) . the closest local group analogue to g1425 might be the pegasus dwarf irregular galaxy ( gallagher et  al .  1998 ; kniazev et  al .",
    "2009 ) , although pegasus is more symmetric , higher in central surface brightness , and redder than g1425 . in these properties , g1425 is similar to the extreme low surface brightness dwarf galaxies ( bothun et  al .  1998 ;",

    "however , those clouds are found embedded in the extensive hi tidal debris surrounding the galaxies ( yun et  al .",
    "1994 ) and have likely formed from hi stripped out of the galaxies due to the group interaction . although g1355 could also have formed through an interaction between m101 and one of its companion galaxies , perhaps holmberg iv , we see no diffuse hi structures connecting g1355 to either m101 ( projected 80 kpc to the sse ) or holmberg iv ( 50 kpc to the south ) .    aside from g1425",

    "the intensity greyscale has been stretched to best show the diffuse hi structures at large radius and low column density , which saturates much of the emission from the inner parts of the galaxy . in our deep hi intensity map ,",
    "the most striking feature is the long plume of hi extending to the southwest of m101 .",
    "this gives the galaxy an hi asymmetry at low column density which is in the opposite sense from that indicated by the high column density things map and at low surface brightness in the optical ( mihos et  al .",

    "the position - velocity plots in figure [ cubepv ] and the channel maps in figure [ channels ] show that this plume co - rotates with m101 , following the general decline in m101 s rotation curve on the southwest side of the disk .",
    "however , the plume does nt show the simple kinematic behavior expected for simple circular motion ; instead , it takes on a loop - like appearance in the channel maps from = 210 to 180 km  s@xmath12 , before filling in with emission at lower velocity of = 150 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "this could be a signature of a warping or flaring of the plume out of the plane of rotation , and the complex kinematic structure of this feature leads to the diffuse , irregular hi emission seen around the main kinematic structure of the plume in the position - velocity maps in figure [ cubepv ] .",
    "in addition to the plume itself , we see a number of discrete hi features in the dataset . near the southwest plume , but discrete in velocity space from the plume itself , we find two distinct hi clouds .",

    "an examination of the extremely deep optical imaging by mihos et  al .",
    "2012 shows no resolved optical counterparts at the position of these clouds .",
    "given their low hi masses , it is unlikely that they could have pulled such a long plume of hi from m101 itself , but they may be similar to the hi clouds seen in the tidal debris in the m81 group , thought to form from tidally stripped gas during strong galaxy interactions ( chynoweth et  al .  2008 , 2011 ) .",
    "the position - velocity projections of the datacube ( figure [ cubepv ] ) also show other hi features kinematically distinct from the ordered disk rotation of m101 .",

    "both these features are projected onto the outskirt s of m101 s disk and are spatially coincident with each of the low surface brightness tidal features seen in the outer optical disk ( mihos et  al .",
    "several dynamical models have been proposed to explain this high velocity gas , including infall of gas clouds onto m101 s disk ( vdhs88 ) and tidal perturbations due to the interaction with m101 s dwarf companion galaxy ngc 5477 ( combes 1991 ) .    to further explore the hi kinematics around m101 ,",

    "this cut runs through the high velocity gas on the northeast side of the disk as well as the extended hi plume to the southwest . on both sides of the galaxy",
    "the projected velocities show a significant decline at larger radius , which could be a signature of either a declining rotation curve or a warping of the disk . while m101 s rotation curve does show a modest drop in the rotation speed in the inner disk ( @xmath661014 ; bosma et  al .  1981 )",
    ", we are seeing this behavior at much larger radius ( @xmath67 30 ) .",
    "a minor axis cut can help discriminate between a warp and an overall decline in the rotation curve .",
    "in pure circular rotation , a minor axis cut should show no gradient , while a warp would skew the kinematic axes with radius and result in a gradient along a fixed kinematic minor axis cut .",
    "we show a minor axis cut in slice b , which does reveal a very modest gradient , but given the beam smearing in our data and the presence of the high velocity gas in the cut it is hard to interpret this gradient unambiguously .",
    "however , we also note that the projected velocities along the major axis show are asymmetric  they drop more steeply on the southwest side of the disk , and along this portion of the cut , diffuse gas can be seen moving both faster and slower than the main spine of the rotation curve .",

    "slices c and d are cuts at constant declination through m101 , and are analogous to the cuts in the hi synthesis map shown in figure 2 of vdhs88 ; slice c cuts through the dwarf companion ngc 5477 and then through the north side of the disk , while slice d cuts through the south side of the disk . in slice c ,",

    "indeed , a cut along the kinematic major axis of ngc 5474 ( slice f ) shows a slight kinematic asymmetry as well ; there is more gas on the lower velocity side of the profile , at similar velocity ( = 240 km  s@xmath12 ) to the diffuse gas found between the galaxies in slice e. the gas at intermediate velocity may represent an actual bridge of material between the galaxies , or simply be a plume of tidally stripped gas that lies between the galaxies in projection .",

    "in contrast , g1355 potentially represents a much rarer object  a starless hi cloud with mass @xmath69 . while such objects are seen in the tidal debris surrounding strongly interacting galaxies ( e.g. ,  chynoweth et  al .",
    "2009 ) , g1355 itself seems to be truly distinct and isolated from m101 s extended ( and likely tidal ) hi plume .",
    "we detect no extended hi emission around g1355 out to a radius of 35  ( 70 kpc ) ; given that g1355 s peak brightness ( 40 mjy beam@xmath12 ) is an order of magnitude greater than the background noise , this places a lower limit on the hi column density contrast between g1355 and its environment of @xmath5 10:1 . in comparison ,",
    "the hi clouds we find near m101 s tidal plume , while comparable in mass to g1355 , are embedded in the more diffuse plume emission with a density contrast of @xmath5 3:1 , and are very likely tidal in origin .",
    "isolated starless hi clouds like g1355 are extremely rare  for example , less than 2% of the hi detected objects in the alfalfa survey have no associated optical counterpart in sdss or dss2 imaging ( haynes et  al .",
    "many ( 3/4 ) of the starless alfalfa hi sources are found in fields with known objects ( haynes et  al .",
    "2011 ) and may be associated with tidal debris or extended hi .",
    "while g1355 is also found in a field with neighboring galaxies , in this case we see no evidence tying it to any of the extended hi in the m101 group .    given that g1425 and g1355 are found in the loose group environment , there may be a significant degree of photoionization from the uv radiation emitted by m101 , as well as photoevaporation from any intragroup medium ( e.g. benson et  al .",
    "because of this heating , it is expected that such low mass dwarfs may be surrounded by an envelope of ionized gas that shields the hi gas from further disruption ( sternberg et  al .",
    "the detectable hi , then , may be just the tip of the iceberg that marks the true gas content associated with these objects . since these dwarfs will also be subject to ram pressure stripping by the intragroup medium , it may well be true that they are newly accreted into the m101 group , or on more circular orbits that prevent them from encountering particularly dense intragroup gas ( e.g. gunn & gott 1972 ; nichols & bland - hawthorn 2011 ; freeland & wilcots 2011 ) .",
    "more speculatively , it might be tempting to call g1355 a pre - reionization fossil dwarf , a protogalaxy whose star formation history was cut short by the epoch of reionization ( ricotti & gnedin 2005 ) . while the canonical fossil dwarf is presumed to be an ancient dsph that is nearly devoid of gas , more detailed",
    "work predicts that there is a class of polluted fossil dwarfs that have a late spurt of gas accretion from the intergalactic medium onto an essentially dark minihalo ( ricotti 2009 ) .",
    "these pre - reionization artifacts , then , should be undetectable optically , but should show up in a deep hi survey due to their cold gas content ( bovill & ricotti 2011 )  similar on the face to g1355 . however , the likeliest location of polluted fossil dwarfs is in voids , not loose groups .",
    "in addition , with a line width of 20=40 km  s@xmath12 , g1355 might exceed the minimum halo mass below which reionization could have halted collapse and star formation in the dwarf ( m@xmath70  ( @xmath71 km  s@xmath12 ) ( babul & rees 1992 ; efstathiou 1992 ) and thus not be a good candidate for a pre - reionization fossil dwarf .",
    "if both g1425 and g1355 are virialized , hi - dominated dwarf galaxies , we can use their hi mass to place them on the baryonic tully - fisher relationship ( mcgaugh et  al .",
    "2000 ; mcgaugh 2012 ) .",
    "there is significant scatter at the low mass end of the relation , for g1425 we get 20=3075 km  s@xmath12  and for g1355 20=2050 km  s@xmath12 . our measurements of 20 ( 77 km  s@xmath12  and 41 km  s@xmath12 , respectively ) are consistent with , but on the high side of , these ranges .",
    "this may argue that both systems are observed largely edge on , which maximizes the rotation width , or that the objects have significant non - circular motion , either because they are not yet virialized , or because they are being tidally disrupted by m101 and other galaxies in the m101 group .",
    "followup hi synthesis mapping would help discriminate between these possibilities and shed light on the true nature of these objects .",
    "the lack of a large population of neutral hydrogen clouds in the m101 group argues that m101 is likely not experiencing significant cold accretion directly from the surrounding intragroup medium .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising for a massive galaxy in the local universe .",
    "s circular velocity ( @xmath5 220 km  s@xmath12 ; bosma et  al .",
    "1981 ) and size suggest a total mass on the order of @xmath72 . this mass marks the threshold above which the galaxy accretes through a predominantly hot , shock - heated mode , where cold flows are unlikely to reach the disk unimpeded by the hot halo . however , kere et  al .",
    "2009 find that hi filaments and clouds can still form via a density inversion as the the accreting gas enters a hot gaseous halo , triggering rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "these clouds rain down radially on the disk from distances of @xmath73 kpc and the most massive of these @xmath45 are expected to survive and feed the disk ( kere et  al .",
    "2009 ) . with n@xmath7 @xmath74 10@xmath75 @xmath4 , a covering fraction approaching 10% , and velocities distinctly decoupled from disk rotation",
    ", this phenomenon could be a channel to form hvcs ( stewart et  al .",
    "2011 ) .    while this hot accretion mechanism can continue feeding gas to the disk of a massive galaxy like m101",
    ", such clouds would be below our detection threshold and go unnoticed in our dataset .",
    "indeed , the masses of g1355 and the two discrete clouds seen near the extended hi plume are all @xmath64 , higher than expected for clouds condensing out of a hot halo .",
    "at least for the two clouds near the plume , it is more likely that they formed through the same tidal interaction that led to the plume itself , much like the hi clouds found in the m81/m82 system ( chynoweth et  al .",
    "2008 ) . while g1355 may have formed this way as well , the lack of a connection to any of the diffuse hi tidal debris around m101 makes this identification less secure .",
    "while the detected cloud masses in m101 s plume are not a good match for clouds accreting from a warm halo , they are similar to the masses of the high velocity gas complexes seen in m101 s outer disk ( @xmath76 , vdhs88 )",
    ". a large fraction of the material tidally stripped during galaxy encounters can fall back to the host galaxy over long timescales ( hibbard & mihos 1995 ) ; were these clouds to fall back on to m101 , they too could punch through the disk gas and lead to the formation of such high velocity cloud complexes ; mass loading during the interaction between the cloud and the disk gas could increase the mass of the resulting high velocity gas complex as well .",
    "thus the clouds we see may well be the progenitors to the current high velocity gas features seen in m101 s disk , spawned by a past interaction that also led to m101 s strong asymmetry and extended hi plume .",
    "m101 s well - known asymmetry has long been believed to arise from an interaction ( beale & davies 1969 ; rownd et  al .",
    "1994 ; waller et  al .",
    "1997 ) , but unambiguously identifying the interacting partner has remained difficult .",
    "the two most obvious candidates are ngc 5477 , located 22(44 kpc ) east of m101 , and ngc 5474 , 44@xmath11 ( 88 kpc ) to the south .",
    "ngc 5477 resides near m101 s crooked ne spiral arm ; while it is clearly distorted and interacting with m101 , its low luminosity ( m@xmath77 ; de vaucouleurs et  al .",
    "1991 ) makes it unlikely to be massive enough to produce such a strong morphological response in a giant sc spiral like m101 .",
    "ngc 5474 is a more luminous system ( m@xmath78 ; de vaucouleurs et  al .",
    "1991 ) and sports a strongly asymmetric disk ( rownd et  al .  1994 , kornreich et  al .  1998 ) , but shows no sign of any extended tidal debris in the optical ( mihos et  al .",
    "previous single dish mapping of the m101 system hinted at the possibility of an hi bridge between ngc 5474 and m101 ( hw79 ) , but subsequent hi synthesis imaging has shown no sign of any hi tidal features around ngc 5474 ( rownd et  al .",
    "1994 , kornreich et  al .",
    "2000 ) which might trace a previous interaction .",
    "our data strengthen the case for a past interaction between m101 and ngc 5474 .",
    "in diffuse hi , we find gas between the galaxies at intermediate velocity , as would be expected from a tidal feature drawn out of m101 by the interaction .",
    "first hinted at in the single dish data of hw77 , this feature can clearly be seen in slice d on our figure  [ pvplots ] .",
    "ngc 5474 itself shows a slight kinematic asymmetry as well ( slice e ) , with more extended hi emission at lower velocities similar to that on the southern edge of m101 s disk .",
    "an accurate estimate of the mass ratio of the m101/ngc5474 pair is quite difficult . because both galaxies are largely face - on , and because of the kinematic irregularity of m101 s extended disk , deriving dynamical masses for each galaxy is fraught with uncertainty ( hw77 ; allen et  al .  1978 ; bosma et  al .",
    "1981 ; rownd et  al .",
    "1994 ) , and estimates of the mass ratio between the pair range from 20:1 to 200:1 depending on the different dynamical mass estimates used . even under the simplest ( and likely incorrect ) assumption that the galaxies have similar mass to light ratios ,",
    "the mass ratio of the pair can range from 15:1 based on the v - band flux ratio ( rc3 , de vaucouleurs et  al .",
    "1991 ) to 40:1 based on the k - band flux ratio ( jarrett et  al .",
    "even with the significant uncertainty , and even accounting for any mass loss that may have been experienced by ngc 5474 during the encounter , it seems clear that this would have been a high mass ratio interaction . for this type of encounter to do such significant damage to m101 s disk ,",
    "the encounter would have to be largely prograde , or involve a close impact parameter , since distant or retrograde encounters typically result in a relatively weak disk response ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "close or prograde encounters would also be effective at drawing material out of the galaxy disks and forming the kinematic irregularities , extended hi plume , and high velocity cloud structures we see in our data .",
    "taken as a whole , our deep , wide - field hi map of the m101 group has revealed a number of features indicative of a very dynamic gaseous environment surrounding m101 .",
    "we have traced m101 s extended ( and likely tidal ) plume of neutral hydrogen 100 kpc to the southwest of the galaxy , where it contains two distinct , massive ( @xmath64 ) clouds .",
    "clouds such as these may be the source of gaseous infall that gives rise to the high velocity gas seen in m101 s outer disk ( vdhs88 ) , as they fall back onto the galaxy from the tidal debris .",
    "we also identify two new discrete hi sources in the m101 group , one a new and extremely low surface brightness dwarf galaxy and another a starless hi cloud or , possibly , primordial dwarf galaxy .",
    "finally , we identify a possible bridge or plume of gas at intermediate velocities between m101 and ngc 5474 which may indicate a recent interaction between the galaxies , possibly leading to their highly asymmetric morphologies and giving rise to m101 s extended hi plume .    with growing evidence that both ngc 5477 and ngc 5474 have recently interacted with m101 , we are building a picture of the m101 group as a dynamically active system .",
    "if our two new hi detections do prove to be gas - rich , relatively unevolved dwarf galaxies , the fragility of these objects in the group environment may further underline the image of a still assembling galaxy group .",
