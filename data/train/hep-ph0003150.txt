    "a number of early and recent model studies of finite density qcd  @xcite have suggested that quark cooper pairs may form above some critical density and lead to ` color superconducting ' matter . although perturbation theory performed on single - gluon exchange suggests pairing gaps of a few mev  @xcite , some recent calculations including non - perturbative interactions , either in the form of the nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite or those induced by instantons  @xcite , indicate gaps as large as @xmath0 mev .",
    "theses values imply that color superconductivity may be relevant to the physics of heavy - ion collisions and neutron stars .",
    "quark pairing singles out one color direction and thus spontaneously breaks @xmath1 to @xmath2 . the pattern of symmetry breaking",
    "may however be richer , since the formation of condensates in one @xmath3 channel competes with the breaking of chiral symmetry in the orthogonal @xmath4 channel . in an earlier paper",
    "@xcite we formulated random matrix models for both chiral and diquark condensations in the limit of two quarks flavors and zero chemical potential .",
    "our aim was to understand the phase structures which result from the competition between the two forms of order solely on the basis of the underlying symmetries . in this spirit , we constructed random matrix interactions for which the single quark hamiltonian satisfies two basic requirements : ( 1 ) its block structure reflects the color @xmath5 and chiral @xmath6 symmetries of qcd and ( 2 ) the single quark hamiltonian is hermitian .",
    "this last condition ensures the existence of well - defined relationships between the order parameters and the spectral properties of the interactions . in particular , condition ( 2 )",
    "is obeyed by single - gluon exchange , which is generally regarded as the relevant description of qcd . aside from conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the dynamics of the interactions does not contain any particular structure . in order to solve the model exactly",
    ", we described this `` dynamics '' by independent gaussian distributions of matrix elements .    in practice , what distinguishes the interactions from one another is their respective coupling constants , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels .",
    "the ratio @xmath11 measures the balance between chiral and diquark condensation forces .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of @xmath7 and @xmath8 play a secondary role .",
    "they introduce a scale in the condensation fields but do not affect the phase structure .",
    "we have shown in  @xcite that the condition ( 2 ) of hermiticity forces @xmath11 to be smaller or equal to @xmath12 .",
    "this constraint results in the absence of a stable diquark phase in the limit of zero chemical potential .    the purpose of this paper is to extend our previous analysis to non - zero chemical potentials , for which the interactions cease to be hermitian .",
    "non - hermitian interactions lead to considerable difficulties in numerical calculations in both lattice and random matrix theories .",
    "standard monte carlo techniques fail because the fermion determinant in the action is complex and the sampling weights are no longer positive definite . obtaining reliable results",
    "thus requires a proper treatment of cancellations between a large number of terms ; a problem which has not yet found a satisfactory solution  @xcite .",
    "the present random matrix models possess exact solutions .",
    "the saddle - point methods used in  @xcite to derive the free - energy as a function of the condensation fields remain valid at finite densities and give exact results in the thermodynamic limit of matrices of infinite dimensions . here",
    ", we will use these methods to calculate the thermodynamics quantities as a function of the condensation fields and deduce the phase diagrams from the field configurations which maximize the pressure .",
    "we will discover that the pressure function has a simple analytic dependence which leads to polynomial gap equations .",
    "this situation reminds us of the gap equations obtained in a landau - ginzburg theory near criticality , and the random matrix approach is analogous in many respects .",
    "both theories associate a change of symmetry with a change of state in the system .",
    "they are both mean - field and describe the dynamics of a reduced number of degrees of freedom @xmath13 , where @xmath13 scales with the volume of the system . in random matrix models , these degrees of freedom can be related to the low - lying quark excitation modes in the gluon background , i.e. the zero modes in an instanton approximation of that background  . in the landau - ginzburg formulation ,",
    "the degrees of freedom correspond to the long - wavelength modes which remain after coarse - graining .",
    "there is , however , an essential difference in the construction of the two theories .",
    "a landau - ginzburg theory starts with the specification of an effective potential for the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "a random matrix model starts at a more microscopic level with the construction of an interaction which , once integrated over , produces an effective potential",
    ". the integration can carry along dynamical constraints and thus restricts the allowed range of coupling constants .",
    "an example of such restriction is the hermiticity condition in  @xcite , which implies that @xmath14 .",
    "this condition is characteristic of the dynamics of the interactions which we consider and remains true at finite chemical potential",
    ". we will therefore take it into account in the following .    in this paper",
