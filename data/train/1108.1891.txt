    "density functional theory ( dft ) is a theory of many - body systems and has become a primary tool for electronic structure calculations in atoms , molecules , and condensed matter @xcite .",
    "the most widely used is the kohn - sham model , in which a many - body problem of interacting electrons in a static external potential is reduced to a tractable problem of non - interacting electrons moving in an effective potential .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the finite dimensional approximations of kohn - sham models so as to provide a mathematical justification for both the directly minimizing energy functional method @xcite and the variational optimization method ( i.e. solving the kohn - sham equation self - consistently ) @xcite and some understanding of several existing approximate methods in modern electronic structure calculations .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we restrict our mathematical analysis and numerical simulations to non - relativistic , spin - unpolarized models . in the pseudopotential",
    "setting , the ground state solutions of the kohn - sham model for a molecular system can be obtained by minimizing the kohn - sham energy functional @xmath0 with respect to wavefunctions @xmath1 under the orthogonality constraints @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of valence electrons in the system , @xmath4 is the electron density , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the local and nonlocal pseudopotential operators respectively , that treat the core electrons and the nuclei as a unit and represent the interactions on the valence electrons @xcite , and @xmath7 denotes the exchange - correlation energy per unit volume in an electron gas with density @xmath8 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation corresponding to this minimization problem is the so - called kohn - sham equation : find @xmath9 such that @xmath10 \\displaystyle \\int_{\\mathbb{r}^3}\\phi_i\\phi_j & = & \\delta_{ij } , \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the effective potential relative to the last four terms in energy functional .",
    "this is a nonlinear integro - differential eigenvalue problem , and is often called self - consistent field ( scf ) equation as to emphasize the nonlinear feature encoded in @xmath11 .",
    "it is assumed in most of the simulations that the ground state solutions can be found by occupying the lowest eigenstates of kohn - sham equation .",
    "it is not known whether the assumption is true , but it seems to be most often the case in practice .",
    "the main difficulties of numerical analysis for kohn - sham models lie in what we have to either handle the global minimization problems whose energy functionals may be nonconvex or deal with the nonlinear eigenvalue problems whose eigenvalues may not be nondegenerate . to our best knowledge , except for the very recent works of cancs , chakir , and maday @xcite and suryanarayana et al @xcite , there is no any other numerical analysis for kohn - sham models in the literature .",
    "we see that the numerical analysis of kohn - sham models is crucial to understand the efficiency of the numerical methods widely used in electronic structure calculations . under a coercivity assumption of the so - called second order optimality condition",
    ", @xcite provided numerical analysis of plane wave approximations and showed that every ground state solution can be approximated by plane wave solutions , and @xcite gave the convergence of ground state energy approximations based on finite element discretizations only . in this paper , we shall present a systematic analysis for a general finite dimensional discretization and prove that all the limit points of finite dimensional approximations are ground state solutions of the system , and every ground state solution can be approximated by finite dimensional solutions if the associated local isomorphism condition is satisfied . we provide not only convergence of ground state energy approximations but also convergence rates of both eigenvalue and eigenfunction approximations .",
    "we point out that the local isomorphism condition should be very mild and is indeed satisfied if the second order optimality condition is provided .",
    "besides the kohn - sham models , there is another approach in dft that is not so popular and is called of orbital - free dft @xcite , in which approximate functionals in terms of electron density alone are used for the kinetic energy of the non - interacting system and only the lowest eigenvalue needs to be computed .",
    "there are several related works on its convergence analysis @xcite and a priori error estimates @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the coming section ,",
    "we give a brief overview of the kohn - sham models and some preparations . in section",
    "[ sec - finite - anal ] , we derive the existence of a unique local discrete solution under some reasonable assumptions . in section",
    "[ sec - error - estimate ] , we prove the convergence of finite dimensional approximations of the ground state solutions with quite weak assumptions and derive the error estimates of ground state energy , ground state eigenfunctions and eigenvalues . in section",
    "[ sec - numerical ] , we present some numerical results that support our theory . finally , we give some concluding remarks .",
    "physically , the kohn - sham model is set over @xmath12 .",
    "but in a lot of computations , @xmath12 may be replaced by some polyhedral bounded domain @xmath13 , for example , a supercell for crystal or a large enough cuboid for finite system , which is reasonable since the solution of always decays exponentially @xcite .",
    "thus we study numerical analysis of finite dimensional approximations of kohn - sham equation as follows : @xmath14 \\displaystyle \\int_{\\omega}\\phi_i\\phi_j & = & \\delta_{ij},\\quad i , j=1,2,\\cdots , n \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath15 on @xmath16 for finite systems and periodic boundary conditions for crystals , where @xmath13 is a polyhedral bounded domain .",
