    "hot subdwarf o stars ( sdos ) represent a small fraction of the central stars of planetary nebulae ( pne ) known so far .",
    "they are blue and evolved objects in their way to the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "their origin is still controversial and several evolutionary paths , e.g. post - agb evolution , can lead sdos to their current position in the hr diagram .",
    "however , it is surprising that only about 18 pn+sdo systems are known to date ( aller et al .",
    "2015 ) , a low number as compared with the large fraction of sdos without associated pne ( @xmath0800 , stensen 2006 ) .",
    "studying in detail the properties of these objects ( morphology , chemical abundances , etc . ) is desirable in order to constrain their formation and evolutionary history .",
    "images and intermediate - resolution , long - slit spectra were obtained with osiris at the gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) , on the observatorio roque de los muchachos ( la palma , canary islands ) . for the imaging , the red tunable filter ( rtf , cepa et al .",
    "2003 ) was used , with a spectral range of 6490 - 6600 .",
    "figure1 displays the false - color h@xmath1 image of rwt152 after the reduction process .",
    "it shows a bipolar shell surrounded by a circular halo .",
    "the two main lobes , slightly different to each other , appear composed of multiple small bubbles .",
    "a bright region traces the equatorial plane of the shell , which most probably corresponds to the ring - like structure identified in high - resolution spectra ( aller et al .",
    "2015 ) . the main shell and the central star",
    "are displaced with respect to the centre of the halo suggesting interaction of the halo with the ism .    for the spectra , the gratings r2500u , r2500v , r2500r and r2500i were used .",
    "they reveal very weak [ neiii ] , [ oiii ] , [ ariii ] , [ siii ] , hei and h emission lines .",
    "the lack of heii@xmath24686 in emission and the line intensity ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath3 @xmath4 8 indicate a very low - excitation pn .",
    "however , the absence of [ sii ] , [ oi ] , [ oii ] , and [ ni ] emission lines is very peculiar for this low excitation , suggesting a density - bounded pn .",
    "the chemical abundances derived and the high peculiar velocity ( @xmath5 92 - 131 kms@xmath6 ) obtained from its heliocentric systemic velocity ( see aller et al .",
    "2015 ) strongly suggest that rwt 152 is a type iii or iv pn .",
