    "the problem of leak detection in water distribution networks ( wdns ) is of significant importance for effective management and water quality control  @xcite .",
    "leaky distribution systems are inefficient due to water loss , energy wastage , and unreliable water quality : especially in case of underground leaks .",
    "these effects are even more pronounced in urban centers of developing countries where the networks are poorly instrumented and maintained .    in case of wdns , leaks or losses",
    "are quantified using unaccounted - for water ( ufw ) .",
    "high levels of ufw are detrimental to financial viability of the system .",
    "losses in wdns are a combined effect of real losses like leaks in pipes or joints , as well as other means like water thefts and unauthorized consumption  @xcite . given the growing concern towards uncertainty in quality water supplies , the problem of leak detection and control has grown in importance .",
    "various techniques based on acoustic methods and magnetic flux leakage  @xcite are available to determine the location of defect ( either small defect like corrosion , or large leaks ) in a single pipe",
    ". however , these methods could be time consuming , expensive , or disruptive in nature .",
    "thus , it is beneficial to use these techniques after narrowing down the leak to a small part of the network .",
    "one approach to leak detection involves the use of hydraulic models and simulators .",
    "available measurements are used to estimate the location of a leak which match the sensor measurements closely .",
    "this method is generally called inverse analysis  @xcite and requires solving a large optimization problem . in order to use this approach , measurements of flow rates and pressures at a large number of intermediate locations",
    "are required , in addition to source pressure and demand flows . in well instrumented networks ,",
    "some flow and pressure sensors are installed for the purpose of district metered area ( dma ) sectorization , but these are few in number .",
    "a more severe limitation of pressure - reading based methods is that predictions depend on precise estimates of model parameters like pipe friction factors , which are difficult to obtain .",
    "practical applicability of this method to large scale networks have proven to be a hard task , as reported by some researchers  @xcite .    2   + ( a ) network with a leaky node     + ( b ) querying a set of pipes    in order to overcome the above difficulties , and to explore a new line of research ,",
    "we propose a method for leak detection which uses only flow measurements that are repeatedly performed on - demand in field campaigns .",
    "we call this process of obtaining flow measurement in a pipe ( on - demand ) as * querying * the pipe for flow .",
    "further , since the only property of leak we exploit is loss of material  ( water ) , the method is equally applicable to any form of loss including thefts - which is not the case for hydraulic model based methods .",
    "even though we show results of our method on wdns , the method itself is much more general and pertains to any distribution system obeying conservation laws .",
    "to briefly illustrate the idea , consider the network shown in fig .",
    "let us say that some node in this network is leaky , and our objective is to find it . by querying the edges in red in fig .",
    "1(b ) , we can trace the leak to either of the two parts of the network ( shown in blue and green ) .",
    "this is possible by exploiting water balance ( or conservation laws in general ) as will be shown in subsequent sections . by performing this operation repeatedly",
    ", we can arrive at a small part of the network which contains the leak .",
    "querying a pipe requires access to it , which may be buried underground at a depth of about two meters .",
    "hence , there is a non - negligible cost associated with every query .",
    "therefore , it is important to minimize queries ( or query cost ) , which requires a strategic field campaign .",
    "an ideal field campaign should possess the following characteristics : ( i )  it should be systematic and arise out of a clear objective ; ( ii )  it should scale to large sectors or the whole network in absence of dmas ; ( iii )  must be capable of assimilating information from other sources ( like existing sensors ) ; ( iv )  should be optimal , requiring only few queries . an algorithmic solution to development of such a field campaign",
    "is the subject of this paper .",
    "before the formal problem setup , we briefly review the basics of algebraic graph theory relevant to this work . specifically , we review the representation of wdns as graphs and matrices , and survey relevant properties .",
    "see chapter  7 of @xcite for further discussion .",
    "* definition 2.1 * a graph @xmath0 is a tuple @xmath1 comprising the set of vertices @xmath2 and edges @xmath3 which are 2-element subsets of @xmath2 .",
    "the number of vertices and edges in the graph are @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the graph could be directed or undirected .",
    "we use the following terms interchangably to suit the particular context : graph and network ; vertices and nodes ; edges , links , and pipes .",
    "the nodes of the network can be classified as source nodes where water is fed into the network , demand nodes or sink nodes where water is removed from the network for supplying to the consumers , and transmission nodes which aid in redistributing the flows .",
    "the edges of the network represent the pipes of the wdn .",
    "we choose an _ undirected graph _ representation for the network .",
    "however , we associate a sign convention with each edge to help identify the direction of flow .",
    "flow will be negative if it is in the opposite direction to the chosen sign .",

    "the adjacency and incidence matrices characterize the network completely .",
    "the other matrices can be computed with their knowledge .",
    "we also review some useful properties of these matrices .    *",
    "property 2.1 * the laplacian matrix is positive semi - definite .    *",
    "property 2.2 * the smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix is 0 . the vector @xmath17^t$ ] ( or simply @xmath18 ) satisfies @xmath19 and hence is an eigenvector correpsonding to the 0 eigenvalue and belongs to the nullspace of @xmath20 .",

    "hence , @xmath26 @xmath27 and in particular holds true for the eigenvectors , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that all eigenvalues @xmath29 are 0 and hence @xmath30 implying @xmath31    * definition 2.6 * a subgraph @xmath32 is formed from a graph @xmath33 such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 contains all the edges with both endpoints in @xmath36 .    * definition 2.7 * a partition of @xmath33 consists of two subgraphs @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that @xmath39    * definition 2.8 * the cut - set of partition @xmath40 is the set of all edges having one endpoint in @xmath36 and the other in @xmath41 .",

    "a partition is said to be balanced if the number of nodes in the partitions are approximately equal .",
    "in this section , we first present the problem statement in the most general form .",
    "next , present a protocol which describes our formulation and solution procedure .",
    "finally , we also present an example to illustrate both the problem and the protocol .",
    "the general objective of leak detection is to locate the ( or all ) leaky unit ( pipe or junction ) using the information that is available about the network .",
    "invariably , additional information in the form of some flow or pressure readings ; and system parameters like effective dimension and friction factor of pipes would be required .",
    "hence , most leak detection procedures address in some form , the trade - off between accuracy or confidence of identified leak and collection of additional information . due to difficulties in obtaining some of these parameters ( like friction factor ) and other reasons specified in section  i , we explore a procedure which requires the use of only flow measurements which are queried on demand .",
    "we first present the assumptions made in the formulation .    1 .",
    "the wdn is in steady state condition .",
    "2 .   the topology of the wdn ( ie the graph representation ) is known .",
    "we possess portable flow meters which can detect the flow rate as well as direction .",
    "one example is ultrasonic flow meters which use time of flight principle .",
    "additionally , we make the following assumptions to simplify and aid the presentation",
    ". we will later show simple methods to avoid them .    1 .",
    "all supply ( source ) and demand ( consumption ) flow rates are measured continuously .",
    "no other permanent sensors are available .",
    "we later present techniques to incorporate any additional sensors that may be available .",
    "there is only one leak in the network , and it is present in a node .",
    "the algorithm naturally extends to multiple leaks and leaks along any point of the pipe as well .",
    "the sensors measurements are noiseless .",
    "if the measurements contain random errors or bias , we can overcome this by using various statistical techniques for decision making  @xcite .    with these assumptions ,",
    "we now present the protocol .",
    "the goal is to find a partitioning algorithm for the protocol that will minimize the cost .",
    "+    graph @xmath44 containing leaky node , @xmath45 ( threshold ) + * initialize : * @xmath46 ; cost @xmath47 + leaky node is in vertex set of @xmath48    each step in the loop will be presented in greater detail in subsequent sections .",
    "we devote two sections ( 4 and 5 ) for development of the partitioning algorithm .",
    "section 3.1 provides an example to illustrate the idea .",
    "section 3.2 outlines the procedure to find the leaky partition using water balance .",
    "finally , we present some extensions to the protocol in section  8 and appendix .      , @xmath49 , @xmath50 represent source , demand , and transmission nodes respectively . production and consumption rates are also shown . ]",
    "consider the wdn shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seq](a ) where nodes @xmath51 are supply nodes , @xmath52 are demand nodes , and @xmath53 is a transmission node .",
    "the demand and supply rates are measured and the values are presented next to the respective nodes ( with signs ) .",
    "the different figures represent the information that is uncovered about the network through the querying process . from fig .",
    "2(a ) , we can see that a total of 30 flow units are supplied ( at @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , whereas only 29 units are consumed at the demand nodes ( @xmath56 to @xmath57 ) .",
    "since the network is in steady state , this is possible only when @xmath58 unit of flow is removed from the system in the form of a leak .",
    "thus , a water balance reveals the presence of a leak , and our objective is to find the location .",
    "it is clearly not possible to identify the leak based on fig .",
    "2(a ) , but only ascertain that there is one .",
    "we make a query of measurement ( @xmath59 ) as shown , which produces the two partitions shown in fig .",
    "2(@xmath60 ) and fig .  2(@xmath61 ) .",
    "a similar balance indicates that the leak is present in the sub - graph comprised of the nodes @xmath62 . note that we must add the additional source term of @xmath59 to the subgraph in order to account for the external flows to or from this subgraph .",
    "we proceed further by querying additional edges for flows as shown in fig .",
    "2(@xmath63 ) and fig .",
    "2(@xmath64 ) .",
    "this approach can be mathematically formalized and presented as an optimization problem with the objective to minimize the query cost in the protocol presented earlier .",
    "water balance is a special case of mass conservation . when considering a generic envelope encompassing a set of nodes and edges ,",
    "it is possible to perform a water balance around this envelope given knowledge of source and sink terms within the envelope ( assumed known ) and flow rates in the pipes crossing the envelope boundary ( which are to be measured / queried ) .",
    "this idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : envelope ] .",
    "the generalized balance equation under steady state condition takes the form : @xmath65 hence knowledge of flow direction is required to correctly apply the balance equation , for which we need appropriate instrumentation . if such instrumentation is not available , alternate methods to ascertain flow direction must be used .",
    "one approach could be to use nominal case hydraulic simulations , and assume the flow directions do not change in presence of leak .",
    "this is likely valid only if the magnitude of leak is small . in general , we assume that either appropriate instrumentation or alternate methods to find flow directions are available . for the envelope shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : envelope ] , we see that in=30 , production=20 , out=10 , and consumption=35 .",
    "hence the balance is violated , and 5 units of flow are unaccounted for .",
    "thus , the leak can be traced to this small part of a larger wdn .",
    "in this section we motivate the graph partitioning procedure and provide various integer linear programming ( ilp ) formulations for the same . as per protocol  1 , we require a partitioning algorithm that will minimize the cost . in practice , finding a partitioning algorithm or policy for minimizing the cumulative cost is difficult .",
    "this is because for any partition , we will not know which subgraph contains the leak till the partition is actually made and the corresponding cost incurred .",
    "thus , the number of possibilities which we need to search over is exponentially large . to overcome this",
    ", we provide an approximate approach or heuristic where at each iteration in the protocol loop , we minimize only @xmath43 subject to some constraints which indirectly take into account costs incurred in subsequent iterations .",
    "we define an indicator variable @xmath66 that indicates the partition to which a node belongs .",
    "formally , @xmath67 is defined as follows : @xmath68 implies node @xmath69 and @xmath70 implies node @xmath71 .",
    "we restrict our attention to the non - trivial case of a connected graph .",
    "consider the @xmath72 element of @xmath73 , where edge @xmath74 connects nodes @xmath9 and @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 this is because only two rows of the @xmath72 column of @xmath7 are non zero ( by construction ) .",
    "further , assuming without loss of generality that @xmath77 , @xmath78 we now make the following observations : @xmath79 the cut - size is the number of non - zero entries in the vector @xmath80 .",
    "this is related to @xmath81 as : @xmath82 where the cost of querying edge @xmath74 is @xmath83 . when presenting the results , we set @xmath84 , but it is clear that the method naturally extends to arbitrary values . as a proxy for minimizing the cost , we propose to minimize @xmath81 while ensuring that the partitions are balanced .",
    "this constraint is important to avoid partitions that myopically reduce @xmath81 to provide lopsided partitions which may endure large cut - costs in subsequent iterations .",
    "parallels can be drawn with binary search , except that in our problem cost for different splits are different .",
    "the two objectives of minimizing @xmath81 and keeping the partition balanced are likely to be conflicting .",
    "thus it is natural to pose the problem generally as a multi - objective optimization problem .",
    "@xmath85 we first propose to remove the absolute expressions so that we can formulate the problem as a standard ilp .",
    "consider the constraint : @xmath86 this serves dual purposes .",
    "firstly , it removes the absolute value expression in the first objective .",
    "additionally , it helps in pruning the search space by removing symmetries . for any feasible solution @xmath87 the solution",
    "@xmath88 is equally valid and would produce the same value for the objective function . by introducing the above constraint",
    ", this symmetry is broken . in order to remove the absolute value expression in the second objective , we introduce two new m - vectors ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) as",
    "decision variables such that : @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93^m \\ \\ \\ \\mathbf{t_2 } \\in [ 0,1 ] ^m\\ ] ]    minimizing the second objective is now equivalent to minimizing @xmath94 , since an element of the vectors , @xmath95 or @xmath96 take the value @xmath58 only when @xmath97 , and are forced to @xmath98 ( minimization ) whenever @xmath99 .",
    "hence the optimization problem can now be written as :    @xmath100^m \\ \\ \\ \\mathbf{t_2 } \\in [ 0,1 ] ^m \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the problem formulation is that of a multi objective optimization problem , there are many different ways to solve it .",
    "each method is based on some notion of the relative importance of the different objective terms .",
    "one simple method is to scalarize the objective function by assigning relative weights to the different objective terms . in this case",
    "however , there is no obvious metric to trade off one for the other .",
    "one suggested method in literature is normalized cuts  @xcite , which proposes a ratio measure .",
    "however , in our problem , the end goal is to minimize cost , for which the n - cut scalarization does nt have a clear physical interpretation .",
    "we study two different paradigms which provide better physical insight for this application .",
    "the first method is that of a lexicographic optimization where the idea is that one objective is infinitely more important than the other .",
    "lexicographic solutions to multi objective optimization has been extensively researched  @xcite and also successfully applied to sensor placement problems  @xcite . here the first objective is given precedence and is minimized first and among multiple solutions which can achieve this , the one which minimizes the second objective is picked , and so on .",
    "in this problem , we give more importance to the balanced partitioning objective , and admit only those solutions which produce perfectly balanced partitions .",
    "conceptually , among the @xmath101 possible solutions for obtaining balanced partitions , that solution which minimizes the cut - cost is chosen .",
    "however , we do not explicitly enumerate all these possibilities , but instead solve the following ilp .",
    "@xmath102^m \\ \\ \\ \\mathbf{t_2 } \\in [ 0,1 ] ^m \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the second method is goal programming , where we set a nominal goal for one objective . for example , this can be introduced in the form of a constraint , so that the search space is confined to those situations which meet this goal .",
    "we use this idea for our problem to get a good handle over the partition sizes . by deviating a little from exact bisection",
    ", we may be able to reduce the cut - size significantly .",
    "in such cases goal programming can be very effective .",
    "we assign a goal on the partition size to take the form @xmath103 which guarantees a minimum size for both partitions .",
    "@xmath104 is a parameter which defines the level of goal .",
    "based on our simulations , a good choice is @xmath105 , so that partitions have a minimum size of @xmath106 .    in ( 5 ) , we have added an additional term to the objective function , @xmath107 . by choosing @xmath108 appropriately",
    ", we can have and hence less than the minimum possible change in @xmath109 .",
    "thus , addition of this term can not alter the optimal value of cut - cost .",
    "the purpose of this term is to ensure that if there are multiple minimum cut - cost solutions which meet the partition size goal , we would obtain the most balanced partition .",
    "@xmath110^m \\ \\ \\ \\mathbf{t_2 } \\in [ 0,1 ] ^m \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the general problem of graph partitioning with partition size or cardinality constraints are np hard  @xcite .",
    "hence , the ilp models formulated in previous sections must be solved directly to obtain the optimal solutions . for large problems",
    ", this may not be feasible , and hence we discus some approximate solution methods .    the idea of approximation algorithms for ilps involve two steps : relaxing some constraints to solve a simpler problem , and a rounding - off step where solutions consistent with the actual constraints are recovered from the relaxed solutions .",
    "graph partitioning has many approximation algorithms in literature which have been successfully used in different domains . for our application ,",
    "approximation algorithms have two uses : it can be used to find quick and reliable estimates of upper - bound associated with the field campaign , thereby help make informed policy calls regarding the feasibility of the field campaign .",
    "additionally , it can also be used for the first few levels of very large networks , where ilps become computationally expensive .",
    "for the subsequent levels , when network size has reduced greatly , the ilp algorithm can be used .",
    "the relaxation step is both problem and application specific .",
    "for example , if one clearly knows the sizes of the partition - a scenario common in circuit design where number of components to be placed on a chip is known , a popular method of choice is the kernighan and lin algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this method is not applicable to our problem since cut - cost is directly tied to our overall objective , and partition sizes can not be accurately predicted . under such circumstances , methods from spectral graph theory",
    "are more appropriate .",
    "our approach in spirit follows from the goal programming ilp formulation , and we ultimately arrive at a result which is similar to the spectral bisection method  @xcite but with subtle differences and alternative interpretations .",
    "consider an assignment variable for nodes to different partitions chosen as @xmath111 which is equivalent to the earlier choice of @xmath66 through the transformation @xmath112 .",
    "we again wish to arrive at an assignment that minimizes cut - cost subject to partition size constraints .",
    "@xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 represent the 1-norm and 2-norm respectively . for cases where edges have different costs",
    ", we can use the simple modification : @xmath116 such that edge @xmath74 connects nodes @xmath9 and @xmath75 . in the previous section ,",
    "the objective was formulated using the 1-norm .",
    "we now choose to minimize the 2-norm to obtain an approximate analytical solution .",
    "assigning some relative cost @xmath117 ( unknown ) to the two objectives , the problem can be posed as : @xmath118 the goal programming size constraint will be imposed explicitly at a later stage .",
    "we relax the integral constraint on @xmath119 , viz .",
    ", @xmath120 to @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "next we express @xmath119 using the orthonormal set of eigenvectors of @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath124 be the eigenvalues of @xmath123 sorted in ascending order with eigenvectors @xmath125 respectively .",
    "defining @xmath126 $ ] we can write @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the vector of projections onto @xmath125 . from property 3.2 , we have @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 . the constraint",
    "@xmath122 is equivalent to @xmath132 with this change of variables , the optimization problem in ( 6 ) after relaxation becomes :    @xmath133    with @xmath134 .",
    "the above problem can be solved analytically as follows :    1 .   if @xmath135 , then @xmath136 and @xmath137 @xmath138 2 .",
    "if @xmath139 , then @xmath140 and @xmath137 @xmath141    the first solution indicates that if cut - cost is significantly more than cost associated with size disparity in partitions , the obvious solution is to not partition at all . this solution is trivial and is discarded .",
    "the second solution indicates that if cost associated with disparity is more than a certain threshold , then the solution is to partition such that @xmath140 .",
    "this suggests the assignment choice as @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue , also known as the fiedler vector . since @xmath144 is orthogonal to @xmath130 , @xmath143 is non - trivial . in order to obtain an integer solution , we employ a simple round off procedure to obtain the solution @xmath119 that is consistent with problem specifications , and also maximizes @xmath145 .",
    "the final solution is :    @xmath146 note that the above solution maximizes @xmath145 which is only an approximation of the original problem . in order to minimize the true problem  ( 6 )",
    ", we need to consider the relative magnitudes of the different eigenvalues which is possible only in a combinatorial setting .",
    "in fact , it is this approximation that enables us to arrive at a computationally tractable solution .    partitioning based on entries of fiedler vector",
    "is known by the name of spectral bisection  @xcite and is known to produce skewed partitions  @xcite .",
    "this problem can be tackled by explicitly imposing a goal programming constraint as shown in figure  4 .",
    "we sort the entries of @xmath143 in ascending order , and normally assign partitions based on sign of the entry corresponding to each node . if we get skewed partitions , we can cut - off the partitions at the threshold defined by the minimum partition sizes .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig.[fig : approx_alg ] .",
    "this assignment ensures that @xmath145 is maximized when adhering to the partition size constraints .",
    "this is because there is a fixed number of sign mismatches that would occur between @xmath147 and @xmath148 which reduces the value of @xmath149 from its maximum possible value . by sorting and assigning nodes to partitions such that sign mismatches always occur with @xmath150 of least magnitude",
    ", the maximum possible value of @xmath149 is achieved in presence of the partition size constraint .",
    "* remark : * while we have presented two methods here ( ilp and approximation scheme ) which work well for the target application as seen through case studies , researchers have attempted other approximation algorithms , and the field of graph partitioning is very rich in literature .",
    "some of these methods employ the use of semi - definite programming and randomized algorithms  @xcite .",
    "we do not present the results of these algorithms since the size of benchmark networks considered in this paper were not large enough to render ilps computationally infeasible , and the spectral bisection method provides adequate performance .",

    ", we have presented this extension in the appendix .      in the original problem formulation and protocol in section  3",
    ", we assumed that pre - installed sensors are not available .",
    "whenever a measurement was required , a query or act of measurement must be performed to obtain the flow rate . however , for well designed wdns , some pipes would already be fitted with permanent sensors .",
    "this could be for dma sectorization , or other monitoring requirements .",
    "in addition to sensors , we can also make use of valves by completely closing the valve through which we indirectly know that the flow rate in that pipe is zero .",
    "if such a disruptive method is not desirable , then the use of valves can be avoided .",
    "one method to incorporate these factors is to simply assign a very low querying cost to those pipes which have valves or sensors installed on them so that partitions containing them are favored over others .",
    "an extreme case of this is to simply remove those edges which have sensors on them from the network before running the partitioning algorithm and then use the appropriate flow rates when performing the water balance",
    ".      the proposed algorithm can be very naturally extended to cases where there are multiple leaks .",
    "in such a scenario , more than one sub - network would show an imbalance at some stage of the hierarchical partitioning exercise .",
    "after this point , we apply the same method to each of these sub - networks with imbalances .",
    "the only binding assumption in such a case is the absence of any material ingress - i.e. all the leaks are material losses out of the network , and water can not enter the network through pipe ruptures .",
    "graph @xmath33 containing leaky node , @xmath45 ( threshold ) + * initialize : * cost @xmath154 0 ; leakyset @xmath154 @xmath155 + * procedure : * ( leakyset , cost ) @xmath154 findleak ( @xmath48 , cost , @xmath45 , leakyset ) + * result : * leaky node(s ) in leakyset      in our work , we have tried to obtain partitions that are balanced in size of the sub - networks ( measured in number of nodes ) .",
    "there are possibly alternate criteria for balanced partitions that take into account domain specific knowledge .",
    "for instance , if a probability distribution for leak occurrences in various nodes are available , we might want to obtain partitions that are balanced in this probability .",
    "this information could be obtained for instance through historical data or models utilizing network properties like pipe lengths , roughness factors etc .",
    "for instance , total length of pipe in a partition could be related to the probability of leak occurrence within the partition .",
    "it is easy to observe that node properties ( like leak probability ) can be easily incorporated into the ilp and approximate algorithms .",
    "however , it is not trivial to partition based on edge attributes ( like pipe length ) which is a line of work we plan to pursue in the future .",

    "in the main text , we presented the algorithm for finding leaks when they occur in nodes .",
    "however , in some cases , leaks may occur at any point along pipes as well .",
    "we now present an extension of the method for this case .",
    "we continue under the following assumptions :      we first present the idea for the simplistic case where there is a single leak and sensors are noiseless .",
    "cosinder the graph @xmath48 which contains the leak ( either the full network , or network under consideration in some step of the recursive procedure ) .",
    "we consider a possible partition into @xmath37 and @xmath38 by querying flows in cut@xmath156 . for the above scenario , a straightforward approach to querying",
    "a pipe is to measure the flows at both it s end points  very close to the node , as shown in fig .",
    "if the flow at m@xmath157 and m@xmath158 do not match , it is clear the leak is in the pipe .",
    "however , if the flow rates at m@xmath157 and m@xmath158 are equal , then the leak is definitely not in this pipe . following a similar procedure for all the pipes in cut@xmath156 , we can trace the leak to either @xmath37 or @xmath38 exactly . in other words ,",
    "the leaky node or pipe is within the partition .",
    "we would of course need to account for the flows by adding source or sink terms to the nodes on which the connecting pipes were incident .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : meas ] , we need to add the flow rate in e@xmath159 by adding a source or sink term at nodes 4 and 5 , depending on the direction of flow . in this strategy , the cost will be twice the cut - cost .",
    "however , it is possible to reduce the cost with some modifications .",
    "when querying a pipe for the first time , rather than making two measurements , we can measure the flow at a single point close to the center . in this case however , the leak need not be in the interior of either partition . since leaks can occur at any point on a pipe , the half - pipe segments of the crossing pipes ( part of cut - set ) could contain the leak .",
    "thus we most modify our definition of partition to include these pipe segments as well ( which are incident on only one node ) .",
    "we do this by introducing an _ artificial _ node at the point of measurement .",
    "thus an edge between an actual node and artificial node represents a pipe segment . with this modification ,",
    "the recursive procedure proposed in the main paper can be used .",
    "after many recursion steps , we may come to a stage where we need to query an edge between an actual node and artificial node .",
    "this amounts to measuring a pipe for the second time , where we already have one measurement for the pipe .",
    "in such a case , the second measurement is made close to the actual node .",
    "if this measurement does not match with the flow measurement obtained at the artificial node , then the pipe segment contains the leak and the process can be stopped .",
    "when the measurements match , we continue with the recursive procedure by eliminating the pipe segment . in this procedure",
    ", only a few pipes will be measured twice and , therefore , the cumulative number of measurements required will be lower . for illustration , consider the situation shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : intermittent ] .",
