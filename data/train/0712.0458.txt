    "several inflation models motivated by string theory have been investigated so far@xcite . provided enormous landscape of vacua via various scenarios of string compactification@xcite ,",
    "they are equally interesting for the reason that our universe might happen to be described by one of them or a combination of some . string models of slow - roll inflation fall into two major categories : in the scenario of brane inlfation , the inflaton field is identified with the location of a mobile d3-brane in a warped throat of the compactified manifold , while in the scenario of moduli inflation the role of inflaton field is played by one or more string moduli . in particular , as a simple example to the latter category , an inflation model was developed using a racetrack potential inspired by kklt construction@xcite within the context of type iib string theory@xcite , and later refined by an explicit construction@xcite of specific orbifolded calabi - yau manifold with two khler moduli@xcite .",
    "one feature of this type of inflation model is that the nonperturbative part of superpotential has a form of double exponentials . with appropriate choices of the parameters ,",
    "this model can give rise to the desired slow - roll inflation , which seems difficult to achieve in the original kklt model with single exponential .",
    "though both racetrack models gave reasonable results consistent with the observational data , some underlying assumptions may still be questionable .",
    "one of them is the assumption that all the moduli are fixed _ priorly _ except for some specific khler modulus , which acts as the inflaton field .",
    "this assumption may not be generically justified if some moduli are coupled to each other too strongly to be integrated out separately . in this note",
    ", we would like to slightly relax the above - mentioned assumption by allowing one open string modulus , which encodes the embedding of our braneworld inside the calabi - yau throat , freely run with the inflaton field .",
    "we will only restrict our discussion based on the original racetrack model@xcite since the functional dependence of open string modulus in the superpotential has been known@xcite . at the end",
    ", we find that this modulus in generic takes nonzero expectation value and therefore the racetrack potential would never be the same as that in @xcite .",
    "we have found our braneworld is energetically pushed away from the tip of throat and the open string modulus is settled at some nonzero value .",
    "our result could still be trusted even if deformation is applied to the conifold singularity of tip , as long as deforming parameter is small enough compared to the open string modulus .",
    "moreover , contribution from this modulus increases with the e - folding so that it can not be simply ignored during the period of inflation .",
    "a full analysis becomes difficult because the scalar potential changes progressively during the inflation epoch .",
    "nevertheless by explicit construction through appropriate choices of the initial conditions in the moduli space , we are still able to build a realistic model achieving enough e - foldings and consistent with the present day observation .    this paper is organized in the following way .",
    "first we briefly review the original racetrack inflation model in the section 2 . in the section 3 ,",
    "we introduce the open string modulus and derive the effective potential and discuss its vacua configuration .",
    "then in the section 4 , with appropriate choices of parameters and initial conditions , we explicitly build a realistic racetrack model which satisfies the slow - roll condition .",
    "some derivation of useful formula are given in the appendix .",
    "in this note , we have set newton constant @xmath0 and plank mass @xmath1 to @xmath2 for convenience .",
    "we remark that different modification of racetrack inflation was also discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "we begin with a brief review on derivation of racetrack potential from the kklt construction .",
    "we consider a compactification of ten - dimensional type iib string theory on calabi - yau manifold with throats in the presence of three - form rr and nsns fluxes @xmath3@xcite and some stacks of d7-branes or euclidean d3-branes wrapping around four - cycles of the compact space@xcite .",
    "these background fluxes generate appropriate potentials which fix the values of type iib axion - dilaton field and all the complex and khler moduli of calabi - yau space except one , denoted as @xmath4 .",
    "we may think of @xmath5 as the volume of compactified space and @xmath6 as the axion field .",
    "our world may be seated on a stack of d3-branes inside one of the throats .",
    "now we consider a modified racetrack superpotential inspired by kklt , @xmath7 the constant term is obtained through @xmath8 for the calabi - yau three form @xmath9 .",
    "the exponential terms are obtained through gaugino condensation nonperturbatively in a theory with a product gauge group , in our case @xmath10 .",
    "coefficient @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the number of coincident d7 branes in each stack .",
    "coefficient @xmath13 s come from the fact that gauge coupling is proportional to the volume of compactified manifold and the latter is warped by the presence of branes .",
    "they were fixed in the original racetrack model but we will argue at this point in the next section . following kklt ,",
    "the scalar potential induced on our braneworld composes of two parts @xmath14 we recall that @xmath15 is the f - term potential for the @xmath16 effective four - dimensional theory , namely , @xmath17 provided that khler potential depends only on this khler modulus or equivalently the volume of calabi - yau space , namely @xmath18 we remark that supersymmetric vacua should satisfy the following conditions , @xmath19 for each modulus , seen as a scalar field @xmath20 in the four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "then the scalar potential is either zero or negative , given by @xmath21 corresponding to a flat or de sitter spacetime .",
    "however , we are more interested in vacua with broken supersymetry .",
    "the supersymmetry breaking term @xmath22 is induced by the presence of anti - d3 branes , which can be placed at the end of throat and stablized by the flux .",
    "its contribution is positive definite and takes form as follows , @xmath23 since we ask modulus @xmath24 plays the role of inflaton field in the background of broken supersymmetry , it does not respect the condition ( [ susy_conditions ] ) . with appropriate choices of parameters , the authors in @xcite found several vacua where a saddle point exists with two local minima nearby .",
    "the @xmath25 e - foldings is achieved when the inflaton field slowly rolls away from its saddle point and inflation is terminated when it is trapped in one of the minima .    .",
    "the potential has a saddle point at @xmath26 and two nearby local minima .",
    "to the right , it shows the plot of potential given @xmath26 in the vicinity of the local minimum @xmath27 .",
    "the potential in both plots has been rescaled by @xmath28.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ] .",
    "the potential has a saddle point at @xmath26 and two nearby local minima .",
    "to the right , it shows the plot of potential given @xmath26 in the vicinity of the local minimum @xmath27 .",
    "the potential in both plots has been rescaled by @xmath28.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "in this section we would like to argue that the open string modulus , denoted as @xmath29 , which was priorly dropped off in @xcite , may not be consistently integrated out at its supersymmetric vev thanks to the coupling with inflaton @xmath24 through the exponential terms . in this note",
    ", we may choose a local complex patch @xmath30 near the end of throat and @xmath31 is the embedding function of our braneworld inside the throat .",
    "the argument is as follows : as long as the volume of compactified manifold is changing during the inflation , the relative location between our braneworld and stacks of d7-branes are changing _",
    "correspondingly_. therefore , it is reasonable to relax the assumption to allow modulus @xmath29 _ dynamically _ run with the khler modulus @xmath24 . in a simplest situation such as the ouyang embedding@xcite , d7-branes wrap around the holomorphic four - cycles parameterized by one complex parameter @xmath32",
    ". then this open string modulus appears in the superpotential through @xmath13 s , namely@xcite , @xmath33 assuming that khler potential has additional dependence on the open string modulus @xmath29 as well as other messenger fields @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( fundamental rep of gauge group on each stack of wrapped d7-branes . ) , such that a no - scale potential reads , @xmath36 now we propose a more general form for superpotential , namely , @xmath37    in particular , applying condition ( [ susy_conditions ] ) , we obtain consistently truncated potential for @xmath38",
    ". however , the modulus @xmath29 fails to be simply integrated out provided the given superpotential and khler potential . to simplify the discussion ,",
    "we will make a further assumption that the embedding only takes place in the real loci , i.e. both @xmath39 are real , though sometimes we still keep notation of @xmath40 .",
    "then the scalar potential is again composed of two parts , @xmath41 the effective potential @xmath15 contains two parts , whose explicit forms are given in the appendix .",
    "we have denoted @xmath42(see equation ( [ v0 ] ) ) as a reduction of full potential @xmath15 for @xmath43 , which takes the same form as in @xcite .",
    "however , the other component , denoted as @xmath44(see equation ( [ v1 ] ) ) , was not included in @xcite and encodes most contribution of open string modulus to the full potential .",
    "we here also choose a specific setup suitable for racetrack inflation as found in @xcite out of many other possibilities , say @xmath45 with additional parameters of our choice , @xmath46 this choice respects the relation @xmath47 , which assures @xmath48 at expectation value @xmath43 in case @xmath49 , though there is no typical reason to do so in generic situation .",
    "for generic @xmath50 , @xmath43 is only achievable via @xmath51 , meaning that this modulus is not stablized and the internal space becomes decompactified .",
    "we also remark that all the scaling symmetries as mentioned in @xcite , i.e. @xmath52 and @xmath53-transformations , are broken for non - trivial dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath29 .",
    "however , the discrete symmetry along @xmath6 direction is still preserved , i.e. @xmath54 for integer @xmath55 , where function @xmath56 is the least common multiplier of two integers @xmath57 and @xmath58 . with these chosen parameters",
    ", we have a saddle point at @xmath59 and nearby minima locate at @xmath60 in the figure 1 , we plot the scalar potential at @xmath61 .",
    "we remark several properties of this moduli space .",
    "first notice that @xmath62 is expected in those specific locations , therefore the racetrack potential in @xcite is _ not _ energetically favored in our refined model . during the inflation , we have found our braneworld , initially at @xmath61 , is energetically pushed away from the tip of throat and settled at @xmath63 for the open string modulus . our result",
    "could still be trusted even if deformation is applied to the conifold singularity of tip , as long as deforming parameter is small enough compared to @xmath64 and @xmath32 .",
    "secondly , @xmath65 at the saddle point and one may guess that the initial motion of slow - roll is along y - direction at least in case of no initial speed .",
    "we will see that this may not be true in our refined model .    at last",
    ", the contribution from @xmath44 becomes significant at large value of @xmath29 ; to see that we found @xmath66 varies from @xmath67 to @xmath68 for inflaton moves from the saddle point to one of the minima , while @xmath22 is about the same order as @xmath42 .",
    "the saddle point implies a de sitter space with @xmath69 and the minima are anti - de sitter space with @xmath70 .",
    "both have magnitude of order @xmath71 .",
    "if we increase @xmath72 up to @xmath73 or more in order to have minkovski or de sitter vacua at the minima , minima shift to @xmath74 .",

    ", we find that before inflation ends at @xmath90 , we only have about @xmath91 e - foldings , which is too small for our observational universe .",
    "however , with fine - tuned initial speed @xmath92 , we are able to achieve in total about @xmath93 e - foldings , as shown in the figure 2",

    "it might stand a good chance to find another set of parameters with inflaton fields of zero initial speed and achieving enough e - foldings , but that could be an exhausting search without some clever guiding principles .",
