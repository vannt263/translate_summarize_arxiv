    "bose - einstein condensates of dilute vapors of atoms offer a very promising testing ground for questions associated with superfluidity for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , these gases are dilute as opposed , for example , to the `` traditional '' superfluid liquid helium . furthermore , the atomic gases can be manipulated in many different ways , including the shape of the confining potential , the strength and the sign of the effective interatomic interaction , the number of different species in multicomponent systems , etc .    while the term `` superfluidity '' covers a whole collection of many different phenomena @xcite , we focus in the present study on the metastability of superflow in annular traps @xcite .",
    "persistent flow has been observed recently in a bose - einstein condensate of sodium atoms confined in a toroidal trap @xcite . in this experiment , an initial angular momentum of @xmath0 per particle",
    "was transferred to the atoms and the rotational flow was observed to persist for up to ten seconds , limited only by the trap lifetime and other experimental imperfections .",
    "persistent currents with two units of angular momentum were also observed in the same experiment .",
    "theoretical studies have examined the existence of metastable states in bose - einstein condensed gases trapped in single- @xcite and double - ring - like @xcite confining potentials , as well as other phenomena in double - ring - like traps @xcite .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , mixtures of two components that are confined in a strictly one - dimensional single ring support persistent currents , but the interaction strength necessary for metastability increases with the admixture of the second component . for comparable populations of the two components",
    ", the critical value of the coupling becomes infinite .",
    "finally , persistent currents with a value of the circulation higher than one unit were shown to be stable only in single - component systems .    in the present study",
    "we investigate the effect of the deviations from purely one - dimensional motion on the metastability of the currents .",
    "we also examine two - component bose - einstein condensates , and find that it is possible to have metastable superflow for sufficiently small admixtures of the second component .",
    "one of the novel results of our study is that in this latter case the deviation from one - dimensional motion gives rise to persistent currents with circulation higher than one unit , as opposed to the purely one - dimensional case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe in sec .",
    "ii our model , and in sec .",
    "iii the two methods that we have employed to solve it , i.e. , the mean - field approximation and numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "iv we present our results .",
    "more specifically , in sec .",
    "iv.a we consider the single - component case and study the existence of metastable states in the transition from quasi - one - dimensional to two - dimensional motion . in sec .",
    "iv.b we examine the effect of the admixture of a second component on the stability of the persistent currents , comparing the obtained results with the ones of strictly one - dimensional motion .",
    "finally , we present our summary and conclusions in sec .  v.",
    "let us consider two distinguishable species of bosonic atoms , labelled as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with populations @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively ; without loss of generality we assume below that @xmath5 .",
    "we also assume two - dimensional motion , which in an experiment corresponds to the case of very tight confinement in the perpendicular direction . in the plane of motion we model the annular trap by a displaced harmonic potential , @xmath6 which is plotted in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "here @xmath7 is the usual radial variable in cylindrical polar coordinates , @xmath8 is the radius of the annulus , @xmath9 is the trap frequency , and @xmath10 is the atom mass , which we assume for simplicity to be equal for both species .",
    "we stress that the results presented below with the potential of eq.([potential ] ) are  at least qualitatively  similar to the ones that we have obtained using a harmonic - plus - gaussian trapping potential .     of eq.([potential ] ) as a function of the cartesian coordinates ( @xmath11 ) , for @xmath12 and @xmath13.,width=340 ]    in order to investigate the effects due to the transition from quasi - one - dimensional to two - dimensional motion , we vary the confinement strength @xmath9 in the radial direction . for large @xmath9 ,",
    "the confinement is strong enough to freeze out the motion in this direction , which makes the system quasi - one - dimensional .",
    "as @xmath9 decreases , the confinement becomes weaker and , as a result , the motion becomes two - dimensional . in all the calculations presented below we fix the radius of the annulus to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the ususal oscillator length corresponding to some fixed frequency @xmath16 .",
    "the interatomic interactions are modelled via the usual effective contact potential , which is assumed to be repulsive . therefore , the hamiltonian @xmath17 of the system is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the single - particle part @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the interaction part , given by @xmath22 here the parameters @xmath23 are proportional to the s - wave scattering lengths for zero - energy elastic atom - atom collisions . for simplicity ,",
    "we take @xmath24 , which is also experimentally relevant in several cases ; furthermore , since the interaction is assumed repulsive , @xmath25 .",
    "we attack this problem using both the mean - field gross - pitaevskii approximation , as well as diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian .    within the diagonalization approach ,",
    "we fix the particle numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the total angular momentum @xmath26 , and use the lanczos method @xcite to obtain the eigenenergies and the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "this can be done for a range of the values of @xmath27 , yielding the dispersion relation @xmath28 , i.e. , the smallest eigenvalue for some given @xmath27 , allowing us to identify the possible local minima associated with the metastable states that give rise to persistent currents in the system .",
    "the basis states that we choose in this approach are the eigenfunctions of the single - particle problem , which are of the form @xmath29 the quantum number @xmath30 corresponds to the radial excitations , @xmath31 is the quantum number associated with the angular momentum , which results from the rotational symmetry of our problem , and @xmath32 is the usual angular variable in cylindrical polar coordinates . the radial wavefunctions @xmath33 are evaluated numerically . if @xmath34 are the corresponding eigenvalues , we work under the assumption that the typical value of the interaction energy @xmath35 is weak enough , so that @xmath36 .",
    "thus , we set @xmath37 and the only quantum number that remains is @xmath31 , whose highest value is chosen so that @xmath38 . having evaluated the single - particle states , these are then combined in all possible ways to form a basis of the fock states for the many - body problem for some fixed @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath27 .    turning to the mean - field approximation , within this approach",
    "the system is described via the two order parameters of the two components , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . from eqs .",
    "( [ hsp ] ) and ( [ hint ] ) one obtains the two coupled gross - pitaevskii - like equations for these two order parameters @xmath43 in the above equations the two order parameters are normalized as @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 are defined as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "finally , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the chemical potentials of the two components .    to solve eqs .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) we make use of a fourth - order split - step fourier method within an imaginary - time propagation approach @xcite . starting with an initial state with some given angular momentum , the imaginary - time propagation drives the system along the dispersion relation @xmath28 until it finds a local minimum .",
    "if @xmath28 has such local minima , the final state may be a metastable one .",
    "otherwise , the initial state decays to the non - rotating ground state of the system .",
    "one should note that the dissipation of the angular momentum @xmath27 is inherent to the diffusive character of this method , and it does not contradict the fact that the hamiltonian commutes with the operator of the angular momentum , since the imaginary - time propagation operator is not unitary , and therefore does not satisfy heisenberg s equation of motion @xcite .",
    "the two methods mentioned above complement each other : the diagonalization gives the full dispersion relation @xmath28 for any fixed angular momentum @xmath26 , but due to numerical limitations in diagonalizing matrices of large size , one has to restrict the number of particles , as well as the values of the interaction strength .",
    "the mean - field gross - pitaevskii approach , on the other hand , does not have these limitations , but does not allow us to evaluate the whole dispersion relation @xmath28  at least in a straightforward way , but rather its local / absolute minima . finally , due to its mean - field character ,",
    "possible correlations between the atoms in certain limiting cases are not captured within this approximation , although they are not expected to be important in the problem that we consider here .",
    "we start with the case of a single component , i.e. , when the total number of atoms @xmath52 is equal to @xmath3 .",
    "we evaluate the minimum interaction strength @xmath53 necessary for the system to support persistent currents as a function of the width of the annulus , or equivalently as a function of the confinement frequency @xmath9 .",
    "as we argued earlier , for large values of @xmath9 , the motion becomes quasi - one - dimensional , while as @xmath9 decreases , the motion becomes two - dimensional .",
    "we solve eqs .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) and also diagonalize the hamiltonian numerically for several values of @xmath9 .",
    "the results of both calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , represented by ( black ) circles ( mean - field ) and ( red ) crosses ( diagonalization ) .",
    "as seen from this plot , the results obtained from the two approaches are in good agreement with each other .    at this point",
    "it is instructive to see how these data compare with the analytical result of a purely one - dimensional model . to reduce the two - dimensional problem into an effectively one - dimensional one , at least in the limit where the width of the annulus ( set by the oscillator length ) is much smaller than its radius @xmath54",
    ", one may start from the initial expression for the energy and integrate over the radial degrees of freedom @xcite . to simplify this calculation , we assume that the density in the transverse direction is nonzero only for @xmath55 , where @xmath54 is the radius of the annulus and @xmath56 is the oscillator length corresponding to @xmath9 . in this limit , the order parameter may be written in a product form , @xmath57 assuming the above factorization , one may start from the two - dimensional problem and derive the following one - dimensional nonlinear equation @xmath58 where the coefficient of the nonlinear term involves the integral @xmath59 . according to previous studies",
    "@xcite , eq.([prodd ] ) implies that the minimum value of the coupling @xmath60 for metastability of currents with one unit of circulation , i.e. , with @xmath61 , is ( in the limit @xmath62 ) @xmath63 i.e. , it scales as @xmath64 .",
    "clearly the numerical prefactor in the above expression depends on the form of the order parameter in the transverse direction @xmath65 .",
    "if we define @xmath66 , this expression may be written in the more convenient form @xmath67 within this simplified model , the obtained power - law dependence of @xmath68 scaling as @xmath64 is in agreement with the numerical results plotted in fig.2 .",
    "this figure shows that @xmath68 indeed increases linearly as a function of @xmath69 for strong confinement in the transverse direction , when the motion is quasi - one - dimensional . from the numerical data we also see that for @xmath70 , @xmath68 grows faster , as the extra degrees of freedom associated with the motion in the transverse direction start to play a role .",
    "we also notice that for small values of @xmath9 , when the confinement becomes weak , the maximum value of the confining potential at the center of the trap decreases .",
    "for example , for @xmath71 , the density of the system is already substantial at the center of the trap , and the deviations from quasi - one - dimensional motion are very pronounced .     for the existence of persistent currents , as a function of @xmath69 in an annular trap with @xmath72 .",
    "the ( black ) circles show the result from the mean - field approximation , and the ( red ) crosses from the diagonalization of the hamiltonian.,width=340 ]      we now turn to the question of metastability in a two - component system .",
    "again , we study the minimum interaction strength for the existence of metastable flow when the atoms are confined in a ( two - dimensional ) annular trap . to do this , we take @xmath73 as before , and consider a fixed and relatively weak confinement @xmath13 , varying @xmath74 . this can be done easily within the gross - pitaevskii scheme , where one can choose any value for the relative population @xmath75 , but not within the diagonalization approach , where one has to specify the ( integer ) particle numbers @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and therefore the values of @xmath76 are more restricted .",
    "in addition , in order to achieve small steps in @xmath76 , the number of particles has to be fairly large , which results in hamiltonian matrices of large size , making it hard to diagonalize numerically .    as before",
    ", one can obtain a simple analytic result for @xmath68 from the result of a strictly one - dimensional trapping potential @xcite .",
    "following the same arguments as in the previous subsection , then eq.([prodd ] ) implies that , with the assumption of a step function for the density of the gas in the transverse direction , @xmath77 which clearly reduces to eq.([gminn ] ) when @xmath78 . according to this simplified model , @xmath68 diverges at @xmath79 and thus metastability can not exist for @xmath80 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the numerical results that we obtain for the minimum interaction strength necessary for the existence of metastable states as a function of @xmath76 , within the mean - field approximation .",
    "the ( black ) circles correspond to a value of the angular momentum per particle @xmath81 equal to unity .",
    "our calculations indicate a divergence of @xmath68 for sufficiently small values of @xmath76 , pretty much like the one - dimensional case , where this divergence occurs at @xmath82 . on the other hand",
    ", metastability takes place at a stronger interaction strength than in the purely one - dimensional case .",
    "therefore , the deviation from this limit works against the stability of the currents .",
    "this result is consistent with the general statement that metastability of the superflow is not possible in trapping potentials which decrease monotonically with the distance from the center of the trap @xcite .     for stability of persistent currents in an annular trap with @xmath72 and @xmath13 , as a function of the relative population @xmath76 , obtained within the mean - field approximation .",
    "the ( black ) circles correspond to @xmath83 , the ( red ) crosses to @xmath84 , and the ( blue ) squares to @xmath85.,width=359 ]    what has been mentioned so far has to do with values of the circulation equal to one unit , i.e. , equal to @xmath61 . according to ref.@xcite , in the strictly one - dimensional problem persistent currents with circulation higher than one unit",
    "are stable only in the single - component case , i.e. , for @xmath86 ( or equivalently @xmath87 ) .",
    "interestingly , unlike the one - dimensional case , our mean - field calculations show that persistent currents with a value of the circulation which is higher than one unit are stable for finite admixtures of a second component .",
    "this result is shown in fig.3 in the two higher curves , represented as ( red ) crosses , and ( blue ) squares , corresponding to @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "the two limiting cases of strong and weak confinement are worth commenting on : as one approaches the one - dimensional limit , i.e. , when @xmath9 increases , the two curves corresponding to higher values of the circulation approach infinity more rapidly , eventually becoming vertical , as in the purely one - dimensional case .",
    "thus , metastability with @xmath88 or @xmath89 is not possible in this limit , in agreement with the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "metastability is not possible , when the confinement becomes very weak , either , i.e. , when the width of the annulus gets large , and the gas has a significantly nonzero density at the center of the trap . in other words ,",
    "the two curves have an infinite slope in the two limiting cases ( of small and large values of @xmath9 ) , but have a finite slope for intermediate values , indicating the stability of persistent currents in this regime .",
    "while the behavior of the system looks similar in both limits , the underlying physical origin of the non - monotonic behavior of the slope of these curves is different in the two extremes . in the limit of small @xmath9 , this is due to the fact that metastability is absent in an almost homogeneous gas @xcite . in the opposite limit of large @xmath9 ,",
    "it is the one - dimensionality of the problem that causes this effect @xcite .",
    "obtained from the diagonalization of the hamiltonian , in a ( two - dimensional ) annular trap , with @xmath90 atoms , @xmath13 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the ( red ) crosses show the single - component case , with @xmath93 and @xmath87 ( @xmath78 ) , while the ( black ) squares correspond to a two - component system , with @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "while in the first case there are two local minima in @xmath28 at @xmath97 and @xmath88 , in the second case there is only one minimum , around @xmath97.,width=340 ]    the results that we have obtained from the numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and are consistent with those of the mean - field approximation . figure [ fig4 ] shows the dispersion relation , i.e. , the lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian for each value of @xmath27 , with @xmath86 ( red crosses ) and @xmath96 ( black squares ) .",
    "more specifically , we have considered @xmath98 atoms , with @xmath93 and @xmath87 in the one case , and @xmath94 and @xmath99 atoms in the other one . in this calculation",
    "the single - particle basis includes all the states with @xmath100 , and we consider the same parameters as before , with @xmath101 , @xmath13 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath28 in the case of a single component has two local minima , at @xmath83 and @xmath84 , showing that persistent currents are stable in both cases .",
    "this is consistent with the result obtained from the mean - field calculations shown in fig.3 . on the other hand , in the case of two components",
    ", @xmath28 has only one local minimum around @xmath97 .",
    "again , this is consistent with the result of fig.3 , since for the corresponding values of @xmath76 and @xmath102 , only the state with @xmath83 is metastable .",
    "according to the present study , bose - einstein condensed atoms which move in annular traps offer a very interesting system for the study of persistent currents .    in principle one could investigate a surface in a three - dimensional phase diagram showing the minimum interaction strength for stable currents as function of both the confinement strength @xmath9 , which determines the deviation from purely - one - dimensional motion , and the population imbalance @xmath76 . given the size and the numerical effort of such a calculation ,",
    "we have instead restricted ourselves to certain parts of this diagram , and in particular we have investigated two different questions .",
    "firstly , we considered the case of one component , and showed that as the width of the annulus becomes larger , and thus there are deviations from the strictly one - dimensional motion , the critical coupling @xmath68 that is necessary to achieve metastability increases .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that a necessary condition for metastability is that the confining potential  and as a result the particle density  does not decrease monotonically from the center of the trap ; in the picture of vortex dynamics , there is a force acting on the vortex that is associated with the rotational motion of the superfluid , which is in the opposite direction of the gradient of the single - particle density distribution .    secondly , we investigated the case of a mixture of two components , in a fixed annular potential .",
    "we found that @xmath68 which corresponds to persistent currents with one unit of circulation increases with the addition of the second component . also , we found a similar behavior as in the one - dimensional problem , where @xmath68 diverges at @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the main effect of the finite width of the annulus is a relative increase in the critical coupling .",
    "on the other hand , a novel result that is absent in the one - dimensional case is the stability of persistent currents with circulation for the larger component which is higher than one unit .",
    "when the motion is one - dimensional , @xmath68 is infinite , and there are no stable currents . as the width of the annulus increases , these currents become stable for interaction strengths which are sufficiently strong , but finite .",
    "when the annulus becomes even wider , @xmath68 becomes infinite again .",
    "therefore , the effect of the deviation from the one - dimensional motion is rather dramatic in this case .    from the above results it is clear that the phase diagram @xmath103 has an interesting structure and that the physics of persistent currents of bose - einstein condensed gases trapped in annular potentials is very rich . with the recent progress in building such trapping potentials in the laboratory",
    ", it will be of much interest to investigate all these effects also experimentally .",
