    "we wish to consider the problem of simplifying immersed planar curves , in a sense which will later be made precise .",
    "intuitively , a generic immersion @xmath1 can be considered as a knot diagram without the crossing data , and for such immersions we can apply planar versions of the reidemeister moves for knot diagrams . by applying all three reidemeister moves to such a diagram ,",
    "one is able to obtain a standardly embedded circle with no double points .",
    "one way to see this is to add crossing data so as to give a knot diagram of the unknot ; applying the standard three reidemeister moves to this knot diagram gives the standardly embedded circle @xcite .    in @xcite , stlund observed that reidemeister 1 is the only move that changes the degree of the gauss map , and showed that reidemeister move 3 is the only move that can change the signed number of instances of certain subdiagrams of the gauss diagram for an embedding .",
    "these properties were used to show that any knot @xmath2 admits a pair of diagrams such that every sequence of reidemeister moves connecting them contains instances of reidemeister moves 1 and 3 .",
    "planar versions of the same arguments give immersions of the circle in which every connecting sequence contains instances of reidemeister moves 1 and 3 .",
    "stlund conjectured that any sequence of reidemeister moves could be replaced with a sequence consisting of only moves 1 and 3 .",
    "a counterexample to this conjecture for the case of knots appears in @xcite .",
    "independently , the first auther showed in @xcite that every knot type admits pairs of diagrams such that every connecting sequence contains every reidemeister move type .    these two arguments , however , rely heavily on information about the crossings , and do not generalize to the case of planar reidemeister moves .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to disprove the planar version of the conjecture .",
    "since every sequence of planar reidemeister moves corresponds to a ( non - unique ) sequence of knot reidemeister moves , the counterexample also provides an alternate disproof of the conjecture for knots .",
    "an _ immersed curve _ is the image of a map @xmath3 where @xmath4 is some surface , such that any point in the pair @xmath5 has a neighborhood homeomorphic to a neighborhood in the picture below .",
    "the pair @xmath6 shall denote the immersed curve .",
    "+ figure 1    in this paper , @xmath4 will usually be @xmath7 or @xmath8 .    [ rmoves]given an immersed curve , the reidemeister moves are given , as numbered below ( 1a , 1b , 2a , 2b , or 3 ) , by identifying a disk in @xmath9 homeomorphic to the disk on the left side of the numbered picture and replacing it with the homeomorphic preimage of the disk on the right .",
    "+ figure 2    by convention , planar isotopies are always allowed as moves , even when not explicitly mentioned .",
    "any two homotopic immersed curves are connected by a sequence of reidemeister moves and planar isotopies .",
    "the argument in @xcite works for an arbitrary surface when there is no crossing data .",
    "an immersed curve @xmath10 is _",
    "@xmath11-simplifiable _ if for some @xmath12 there exists a sequence of immersed curves @xmath13 such that @xmath14 is obtained from @xmath15 by applying one of reidemeister moves 1a , 1b , or 3 , and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an embedding .",
    "the sequence @xmath13 is called a _ simplifying sequence _ for the curve @xmath18    if @xmath4 is a surface of genus at least @xmath19 and @xmath10 is not nullhomotopic , then @xmath10 is not @xmath11-simplifiable .",
    "this is because the reidemeister moves applied to curves preserve homotopy type .",
    "stlund s conjecture , stated in our language , is that every immersed planar curve is @xmath11-simplifiable .",
    "since any curve which is @xmath11 -simplifiable in @xmath20 is @xmath11-simplifiable in its one point compactification @xmath8 , the next theorem suffices to disprove the conjecture :    [ main theorem][main]the following curve is not @xmath11-simplifiable in @xmath8 :     + figure 3    the proof of this theorem does not rely on heavy machinery .",
    "it should be noted that there are immersed curves without an obvious simplifying sequence , which are nonetheless @xmath11-simplifiable .",
    "for example , consider the following :     + figure 4    the easiest way to show that this curve is @xmath11-simplifiable is to apply this theorem :    [ double bigon]let @xmath21 be a @xmath11-simplifiable curve .",
    "suppose that in @xmath21 we replace some instances of the local picture    with the local picture    relative boundary ( i.e. double bigons replace double points ) to obtain curve @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath21 is @xmath11-simplifiable , then @xmath22 is @xmath11-simplifiable .",
    "it should be noted that theorem  [ double bigon ] does not say that moves 1 and 3 may be used to replace a double point with a double bigon in an arbitrary diagram .",
    "nonetheless , applying theorem  [ double bigon ] repeatedly to figure 5 gives the following @xmath11-simplifiable immersed curve :    one could generalize stlund s conjecture and ask whether two homotopic curves on a surface are related by only the first and third reidemeister moves . this generalized conjecture is much easier to falsify .",
    "it is in fact a generalization because all generic curves on @xmath7 or @xmath8 are homotopically trivial .",
    "[ torus]the following two curves on @xmath23 are homotopic , but are not related by a sequence of reidemeister moves consisting of only the first and third moves .",
    "this section proves theorem [ main ] .",
    "consider the following shaded regions in the curve from figure  4 , interpreted as a diagram on @xmath8 :     + figure 5    reinterpret the diagram as a collection of eight blue boxes containing immersed tangles , connected by lines with no double points .",
    "each box has a left and right side , as labeled below ; the left side of a given box is connected to the right side of its neighbor .",
    "two polygons in the diagram deserve special attention and are marked with a star .",
    "+ figure 6    the diagram satisfies the following properties :    1 .   [ strands ends ] each blue box contains a tangle with three strands .",
    "one of the strands , denoted strand 1 , begins and ends at the left side .",
    "strand 2 begins and ends at the right side .",
    "strand 3 has one endpoint on each side of the box .",
    "[ strands connect ] in each box , the left side of strand 3 connects to strand 2 in the adjacent box to the left .",
    "the right side of strand 3 connects to strand 1 in the adjacent box on the right .",
    "[ strands two double ] strands 1 and 2 intersect in exactly two double points . 4 .",
    "[ strands four sides]the polygons marked with a star have at least four sides .",
    "we will show that any application of moves 1a , 1b , or 3 to any copy of figure  6 with immersed tangles satisfying the above properties results in a diagram which may be interpreted as a copy of figure  6 with immersed tangles still satisfying those properties .",
    "since property  [ strands two double ] implies that any blue box has at least two double points , every sequence of such moves results in a diagram with at least sixteen double points .",
    "this proves that the curve is not @xmath11-simplifiable .",
    "first , note that a move of type 1a , 1b , or 3 occuring entirely within one of the blue boxes gives a diagram ( with the same boxes ) satisfying all of the above properties .",
    "such a move fixes the endpoints of the strands , so properties  [ strands ends ]  and  [ strands connect ] remain satisfied .",
    "none of these moves change the number of times one strand intersects another within a box , so property  [ strands two double ] holds after a move .",
    "property  [ strands four sides ] actually follows from the arrangement of the boxes and the other three properties .",
    "fix a starred polygon and consider the portion of its boundary lying within a single blue box .",
    "if the end points of that boundary portion belong to different strands within the box , that box contains at least one vertex for the starred polygon .",
    "otherwise , property  [ strands ends ] implies that both ends belong to strand 3 .",
    "then property  [ strands connect ] implies that the end points for the portion of the starred polygon s boundary lying in each of the adjacent blue boxes belong to different strands within that box .",
    "thus each of the adjacent boxes contains a vertex for the starred polygon .",
    "therefore , allowed moves can not reduce the number of vertices ( or edges ) for a starred polygon below four .",
    "it remains to show that it suffices to consider only moves lying within a single blue box .",
    "first , consider reidemeister move 1b . performing this move",
    "requires a disk in our immersed curve that is homeomorphic to the disk on the left side of picture 1b in figure 2 in definition [ rmoves ] .",
    "suppose that the segment on the left side of picture 1b in definition [ rmoves ] is not contained completely inside one of the blue boxes as specified above .",
    "then one can redefine the blue box before performing the move so that it occurs entirely within a single blue box .",
    "for example , suppose that the disk for move 1b is the following :    one can then isotop the blue boxes , while leaving crossings fixed , as follows :    move 1a , on the other hand , removes a one - sided polygon .",
    "this polygon must lie entirely within a single blue box , for the following reason : clearly , a one - sided polygon can not separate the two starred regions .",
    "if a closed smooth subcurve of @xmath24 does not lie in a single blue box , and does not separate the two starred regions , then it must enter and exit one of the blue boxes on the same side .",
    "such a curve contains a segment of strand type 1 or 2 , and by property [ strands two double ] , any such curve will have at least two crossings",
    ".    finally , move 3 always occurs on a neighborhood of a triangle ( which can never be marked with a star ) .",
    "if that triangle lies entirely in one blue box , that box may be isotoped as above to include the entire disk on which the move occurs . otherwise , the triangle intersects the white region ( an example of such a potential triangle is marked with a red dot in figure  6 ) .",
    "one can verify that this implies that one of the blue boxes intersects the triangle only in a single corner , as shown in figure  7 , for example .",
    "+ figure 7    assume without loss of generality that the triangle extends to the right of the blue box containing just the corner , as in figure 7 .",
    "there are two possibilities for the strand ends on the right side of the leftmost box shown in figure  7 .",
    "either exactly one of the ends belongs to strand 3 , or both ends belong to strand 2 . in the box to the right ,",
    "either both of the pictured left ends belong to strand 1 , or exactly one belongs to strand 3 , respectively . in either case",
    ", isotoping the blue boxes in figure  7 to give the blue boxes in figure  8 preserves the required properties and reduces the number of white regions in the triangle .",
    "after at most two such box adjustments , all three vertices of the triangle must lie in the same blue box .",
    "then , since there are no isolated blue corners , the entire triangle must lie within a single blue box .",
    "+ figure 8    one could also prove this theorem using gauss diagrams .",
    "we give the main outline , leaving the proof to the reader .",
    "the gauss diagram for the immersed curve in figure 4 is as follows :     + figure 9    move 1b adds a chord to the diagram , which by convention shall be colored gray .",
    "the following properties are preserved by reidemeister moves 1 and 3 .    1 .",
    "if all the gray lines are erased , the resulting diagram is exactly as shown in figure 9 above except that some of the adjacent and parallel pairs of black lines may be replaced with crossed pairs .",
    "2 .   both endpoints of every gray chord lie in one of the eight regions indicated in figure  9 .",
    "[ double bigon lemma]the following pictures are connected by a sequence of reidemeister moves 1 and 3 :      [ proof of theorem [ double bigon]]consider two immersed curves @xmath25 and @xmath26 , equal except inside of a box .",
    "the contents of the box for the curves @xmath25 and @xmath26 are given respectively by the following pictures on the left and right :    suppose @xmath25 is @xmath11-simplifiable",
    ". then reidemeister moves performed on @xmath25 that are supported away from the box have analagous reidemeister moves on @xmath26 .",
    "however , the simplifying sequence for @xmath25 may contain moves 1a and 3 which involve the box .",
    "the following sequences of moves on @xmath26 are analogous to moves 1a and 3 on @xmath25 which involve the box . in these sequences",
    "it may be necessary to first apply lemma [ double bigon lemma ] to obtain the leftmost picture .",
    "such that the two strands of the tangle inside the disk intersect , one can never obtain an embedded curve ( i.e. a curve without double points ) . observe that in the picture above , there is exactly one region not contained in the disk , and this region has genus .",
    "up to isotopy every r1a , r1b and r3 move is supported within the disk . however , as noted in the proof of the main theorem , r1 and r3 moves on tangles do not change the number of intersections between strands ."
