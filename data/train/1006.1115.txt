    "<S> we develop a model to describe the properties of random assemblies of polydisperse hard spheres . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the key features to describe the system are _ ( i ) _ the dependence between the free volume of a sphere and the various coordination numbers between the species , and _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ the dependence of the coordination numbers with the concentration of species ; quantities that are calculated analytically . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts the density of random close packing and random loose packing of polydisperse systems for a given distribution of ball size and describes packings for any interparticle friction coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism allows to determine the optimal packing over different distributions and may help to treat packing problems of non - spherical particles which are notoriously difficult to solve .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding the basic properties of spheres packings is a major challenge since this problem may provide valuable knowledge regarding low temperature phases in condensed matter physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the canonical example is perhaps the monodisperse sphere packing problem . </S>",
    "<S> it has been mathematically proven that the optimum way to arrange monodisperse spheres is the face - centered cubic lattice ; a problem that has been solved recently by hales , @xmath0 400 years after the famous kepler conjecture on the issue . on the other hand , it is commonly observed that packings arrange in a random fashion at a lower density state called random close packing or rcp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , packings are mechanically stable up to an even lower limit called random loose packing , rlp .    in parallel with the large literature dealing with monodisperse sphere packings , a large body of experimental </S>",
    "<S> , theoretical and numerical work has been devoted to the analysis of polydisperse systems ; the interest arising due to the simple fact that polydispersivity is omnipresent in most realistic systems and industrial applications @xcite . while previous approaches have focused on frictionless packings , an integrated analytical approach that brings together different observations for all packings from rlp to rcp and for any friction or coordination number is still lacking . </S>",
    "<S> based on our previous statistical mechanics approach @xcite , here we build such a framework .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that the key aspect to solve this problem is the dependence of the various coordination numbers between the different species and the concentration of the species . </S>",
    "<S> this is calculated here and shown to agree well with computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this result is then incorporated into a statistical theory of volume fluctuations as in @xcite which calculates the free volume of a particle in terms of the coordination number . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is the prediction of the rlp and rcp limiting densities for a given distribution of ball sizes as well as the prediction of densities for any packing in between those limits . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism allows for a determination of the best packing fraction in terms of different distribution of ball sizes with specified constraints , as we show with a simple example . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible generalization of the method to solve more difficult problems like the phase behavior of systems of non - spherical particles like rods or spherocylinders in any dimensions ; problems of long - standing history in condensed matter @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical advances @xcite allow for the prediction of the density of rcp and rlp for equal - size ball packings using a relation between the average volume and the geometrical coordination number . following this approach , </S>",
    "<S> we here describe long - range spatial correlations through a mean - field background term . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation makes the problem amenable to analytic calculations , and is shown to describe well our simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit inclusion of such correlations is possible in our framework , but severely complicates any solution attempts . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we believe that the present approach is accurate enough for many important properties , such as the volume fraction calculation .    the above theoretical framework will guide the present formalism for polydisperse systems . </S>",
    "<S> we first treat the case of binary mixtures of hard spheres of radius @xmath1 and @xmath2 in 3d and then generalize the problem to any distribution and dimension . </S>",
    "<S> * calculation of @xmath3. * the key quantity to calculate is @xmath3 , denoting the mean number of contacts of a ball of radius @xmath4 with a ball of radius @xmath5 , versus the concentration of one of the species . we need a formula for @xmath3 as a function of @xmath6 , the later being the size ratio , @xmath7 is the fraction of small balls in the packing @xmath8 with @xmath9 the number of @xmath10 balls and @xmath11 is the global geometrical coordination number averaged over all the particles : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the average coordination of each species .    </S>",
    "<S> the coordinations are determined by three equations : @xmath14 we assume that these coordinations are inversely proportional to the average solid angle extended by contacting balls @xmath1 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the average solid angles are denoted @xmath16 and are calculated in terms of the solid angle that a ball @xmath5 occupy on a ball @xmath4 according to @xmath17 with ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ voro]a ) @xmath18    thus , @xmath19 represents the mean occupied surface on a @xmath10 ball weighted by the concentrations @xmath7 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this represents an approximation since the real weights are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . then , @xmath23 leading to the following normalizations : @xmath24    thus , the system of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ z1221 ] ) is reduced to a system of three equations for four unknowns @xmath3 . to close the system </S>",
    "<S> we assume proportional laws and deduce @xmath3 from @xmath13 by considering that @xmath3 is proportional to the number of contacts of the @xmath10 balls times the number of contacts of the @xmath25 balls : @xmath26 using the first equation in ( [ z1221 ] ) we find the constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 , leading to the solution : @xmath29    figure  [ fig : zandp]a , compares this solution to numerical simulations of hertz packings jammed at rcp @xcite for @xmath30 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the formulae are very accurate for size ratios below 1.5 and present small deviations up to size ratio 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are also in agreement with @xcite .    * </S>",
    "<S> the voronoi cell. * the common way to divide a system into volumes associated with each particle is the voronoi tessellation . the voronoi cell for monodisperse particles @xcite is composed by all the points nearest to the center of the ball than to any other ball . </S>",
    "<S> this definition has been extended in @xcite to the case of polydisperse systems and non - spherical particles : instead of considering the classical voronoi polyhedron defined by the center of the particle , one should consider all the points which are closer to the surface of a given particle . </S>",
    "<S> such a construction is called the _ </S>",
    "<S> voronoi s region _ and tiles a system of nonspherical convex particles and polydisperse systems as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ voro]b . following this approach </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the average volume of a polydisperse voronoi cell , denoted @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the volume fraction is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the mean volume of a ball . </S>",
    "<S> we first find the analytical formula of the voronoi s region . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary of the voronoi cell in the direction @xmath35 of a @xmath10 ball next to a @xmath25 ball at position @xmath36 is ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ voro]b ) :    @xmath37    where @xmath35 and @xmath38 are unitary . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the boundary of a voronoi cell of a ball @xmath10 in the direction @xmath35 is the minimum of @xmath39 over all the particles @xmath25 for any @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to    @xmath41    the volume of the cell of the ball @xmath10 is then given by @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we define the orientational voronoi volume , @xmath43 , along the direction @xmath35 by @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to    @xmath45    this definition leads to the results of @xcite when @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> since the system is isotropic , the mean voronoi volume can be calculated as :    @xmath47    * calculation of the mean voronoi volume. * having calculated the voronoi cell exactly in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ voronoi ] ) , we now proceed to develop a probability theory of volume fluctuations in the spirit of the quasiparticle approximation used in @xcite to obtain the mean voronoi volume . for a given ball @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> , the calculation of @xmath48 reduces to finding the ball @xmath49 that minimizes @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> we call @xmath49 the voronoi ball for the ball @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we just need to compute the inverse cumulative distribution function , denoted @xmath54 , to find all the balls @xmath25 with @xmath55 , and thus not contributing to the voronoi volume of the ball @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the average voronoi volume is then given by the expression    @xmath56    we calculate the mean voronoi volume for the balls of radius @xmath1 and @xmath15 separately and then average them . </S>",
    "<S> we denote @xmath57 and @xmath58 the inverse cumulative distributions respectively , and @xmath59 and therefore , @xmath60    * calculation of @xmath54. * there are three salient steps in the calculation of @xmath54 : _ ( i ) _ the separation of @xmath54 following eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p_c ] ) . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ the separation of each term @xmath61 , @xmath62 , into two contributions : a term taking into account the contact spheres , @xmath63 , and a bulk term , @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the contact term clearly depends on @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk term averages over all spatial correlations of non - contact particles and , without significant loss of accuracy as shown below , we assume that it only depends on the average value of @xmath32 . in principle , it is possible to use a more realistic form for this term , but this would render the problem practically unsolvable . _ ( iii ) _ the separation of @xmath63 and @xmath65 into two terms @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 , for each species .    </S>",
    "<S> an assumption of the theory ( to be tested a posteriori with computer simulations ) is that all of these terms are independent . </S>",
    "<S> thus    @xmath69    also , we work in the limit of large number of particles leading to boltzmann - like exponential distributions for each @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> four important quantities are then defined : _ ( i ) _ @xmath72 and _ ( ii ) _ @xmath73 : the excluded volume and surface on the ball , respectively , where no center of a ball @xmath25 can be located for a given ball @xmath10 and for a given @xmath74 . _ ( iii ) _ @xmath75 : the mean number of balls @xmath25 by the left free volume . _ ( iv ) _ @xmath76 : the mean number of balls @xmath25 by the left free surface on a ball @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> these considerations lead to : @xmath77    next , we calculate these four quantities . to simplify we denote @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 the step - function . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 and @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth quantity , @xmath76 , is the most difficult to calculate . in terms of the occupied areas </S>",
    "<S> eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ occ ] ) we have @xmath84 </S>",
    "<S> . however , for the contact terms , the analogy with the boltzmann - like exponential distribution of volumes is far from being exact . </S>",
    "<S> this is because this form is based on the large number limit which in the case of contacting balls is no more than around 6 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the exponential distribution is used as an ansatz with @xmath76 a variational parameter as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we denote @xmath85 the mean solid angle of the gaps left between the @xmath25 contacting neighbors of a @xmath10 ball ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ voro]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain :    @xmath86    then , we perform numerical simulations to find @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> we randomly generate balls of radius @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the proportion @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively around a ball of radius @xmath4 and then evaluate the mean free surface @xmath88 and its inverse to obtain @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> we find    @xmath89    which is a generalization of the results of @xcite to polydisperse systems .    </S>",
    "<S> using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pij ] ) , ( [ sstar ] ) and ( [ rhos ] ) into ( [ pc ] ) , @xmath54 can be calculated by solving the equations numerically . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : zandp]b depicts the comparison of the theoretical results of the probability of voronoi volumes @xmath54 with computer generated hertzian packings with @xmath31 for @xmath90 at rcp . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated distribution is quite accurate for most of the range except for small deviations at high values of @xmath74 , which however , do not affect much the value of the average @xmath91 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ww ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that our mean - field approximation already captures the main contribution of the probability distribution function @xmath54 .    </S>",
    "<S> * calculation of @xmath32. * the above considerations lead to a final form to calculate @xmath92 using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pc ] ) into ( [ ww ] ) : @xmath93 notice that @xmath94 depends on @xmath32 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sstar ] ) , and @xmath95 depends on the @xmath3 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rhos ] ) , which in turn depends on the concentration @xmath7 and @xmath11 through eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ zs ] ) </S>",
    "<S> . therefore eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ final ] ) is a self - consistent equation to obtain @xmath96 , for a given @xmath97 . a numerical integration of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ final ] ) is performed versus @xmath7 for a given value of @xmath11 . by considering the isostatic limits of @xmath31 and @xmath98 we predict the limits of rcp and rlp at zero friction and infinite friction between the spheres , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the volume fraction at rcp versus @xmath7 are depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : jamcompare]a which also compares the results to numerically generated packings of hertz spheres @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we see a very good agreement indicating that the theory captures well the behavior of polydisperse packings and that the approximations used are reasonable . for size ratios larger than 2 deviations </S>",
    "<S> are found indicating the limit of validity of the approach . </S>",
    "<S> for any other value of interparticle friction between 0 and @xmath99 , the density is obtained by setting @xmath11 between the limiting isostatic values of 6 and 4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting volume fraction is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : jamcompare]b . </S>",
    "<S> the result for rlp for a given @xmath7 is a new prediction as this problem has not been investigated before . </S>",
    "<S> our results promote new experiments to test the rlp limit of polydisperse systems shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : jamcompare]b .    the formalism can be extended to consider any distribution of sphere radius . </S>",
    "<S> the main modification is that all the sums over the radius are replaced by integrations over the desired distribution of radius @xmath100 ( the binary case corresponds to two delta - functions at @xmath1 and @xmath15 ) .    and </S>",
    "<S> all the quantities are calculated for balls of internal radius @xmath101 and external @xmath102 and @xmath7 and @xmath20 are replaced by @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively , including the coordinations ( see supplementary information b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result allows to explore the space of radius distributions in search of the optimal packings for a given polydispersivity . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis could be of industrial interest if one wishes to optimize the packing fraction by introducing different species in the mixture .    </S>",

    "<S> we calculate the volume fraction for various @xmath100 ranging from uniform to two - peaked gaussian distributions of varied widths . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the more small balls we add the better the packing until a certain point where the volume fraction starts to decrease . </S>",
    "<S> this maximum can be rationalized assuming that the small balls always fill the gaps between the large ones as long as there are enough large balls . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ voronoi ] ) and developing a theory of volume fluctuation in d - dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that many of the approximations employed in 3d may become exact for large d , thus we expect improved results in the mean field limit of infinite dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> the method allows to treat more difficult problems . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the prediction of the volume fraction of a jammed system of non - spherical particles is a long - standing problem . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical predictions of onsager @xcite are valid for large aspect ratios , like elongated rods . </S>",
    "<S> experiments however , find interesting new physics for small aspect ratios . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> , the present polydisperse theory could be mapped to the problem of ellipsoids , spherocylinders or rods . </S>",
    "<S> a voronoi cell needs to be calculated as a function of the angles defining the orientation of the non - spherical particles in analogy of the calculation between two particles of different radii . </S>",
    "<S> the integration over @xmath108 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ final ] ) is then replaced by integration over weighted orientational angles . the above analysis can also be extended to dimensions beyond three @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although many of the appproximations should work better in higher dimensions , some of the hypotheses ( for example , the contact term ansatz ) need to be reassessed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , higher dimensions studies can not be addressed as trivial extensions and need to be handled with care .    in summary </S>",
