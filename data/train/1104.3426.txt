    "complex fluids such as colloidal suspensions and emulsions are often regarded as macroscopic models of atomic or molecular systems .",
    "they are ideal benches to test liquid theories developed to describe thermodynamic , dynamic , and structural properties of atomic and molecular liquids  @xcite .",
    "it is not only because the size of constituent unit of complex fluids are much larger than atomic counterpart but also because their interparticle interactions can be tailor - made and tuned relatively easily .",
    "while the pair interactions of atomic systems are exclusively characterized by short - ranged and strong repulsions with weak and longer - ranged attractions , leading to the typical phase diagram demarcating gas , liquid , and crystalline phases  @xcite , those for the complex fluids are far more diverse .",
    "this diversity leads to very rich and often counter - intuitive macroscopic behaviors  @xcite . amongst those interactions , the _ ultra - soft _",
    "potential have attracted particular attention recently in the soft - condensed matter community  @xcite .",
    "the ultra - soft potentials are isotropic repulsive potential characterized by weak and bounded repulsion at short distance and the mild repulsive tails whose steepness is much smaller than the typical atomic potential .",
    "these potentials are realized in many complex fluids such as star - polymers  @xcite , dendrimers  @xcite , and the polymers in good solvent  @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic phase diagrams of the ultra - soft particle systems have very distinct and exotic properties such as the re - melting from solid to fluid phase at high densities , the re - entrant peak at the intermediate densities  @xcite , negative thermal expansion coefficient  @xcite , and the cascades of the various crystalline phases at very high densities  @xcite .",
    "the gaussian core model ( gcm ) is one of the simplest examples of the ultra - soft potential systems .",
    "gcm consists of the point particles interacting with a gaussian shaped repulsive potential ; @xmath3 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the interparticle separation , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the parameters which characterize the energy and length scales , respectively .",
    "gcm was first introduced by stillinger  @xcite and has been studied by many groups  @xcite . despite of its simple form of the pair potential , gcm exhibits many typical thermodynamic behaviors of the ultra - soft particles . according to thermodynamic phase diagram obtained by numerical simulations  @xcite",
    ", gcm basically behaves like hard spheres at very low densities and temperatures ; the crystalline structure in the solid phase is fcc and the freezing / melting temperatures sharply increase with density .",
    "however , as the density increases further , the freezing temperature reaches a maximal value and beyond this point it changes to a decreasing function of the density .",
    "this re - entrance takes place at @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is the number density .",
    "concomitantly , the crystalline structure changes from fcc to bcc .",
    "recently , thermodynamic and transport anomalies of the fluid phase in the vicinity of the reentrant peaks are investigated  @xcite .",
    "microscopic and structural properties such as the static structure factor in the fluid phase are also reported and documented  @xcite .",
    "these studies revealed that , as the density increases beyond the reentrant peak but at a fixed temperature , thermodynamic and structural properties of gcm becomes more ideal - gas - like , signaled by the lowering of the peak of the structure factors and the better agreement with simple approximations such as the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "most of studies in the past , however , have focused on the densities not far from the reentrant peak or the relatively high temperatures .",
    "less attention has been paid for the high density and low temperature regimes , especially in the vicinity of the solid - fluid phase boundary . near the phase boundary line , the thermodynamic and structural properties",
    "are expected to be highly non - trivial even at the high density limit .",
    "based on the duality argument of the ground state of gcm in the reciprocal space , stillinger has conjectured that the freezing and melting temperatures , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are given by an asymptotic form ; @xmath10 in the high density limit  @xcite .",
    "however , this conjecture has not been confirmed numerically .",
    "recently , we studied the nucleation and glassy dynamics of the one - component gcm in the supercooled state at the unprecedentedly high densities , @xmath11  @xcite . it was found that the crystal nucleation rate decreases drastically as the density increases and concomitantly dynamics of the constituent particles becomes very sluggish .",
    "the density time correlation function exhibits typical behavior of the supercooled liquids near the glass transition point , such as the two - step and non - exponential structural relaxation .",
    "the relaxation time steeply increases as the temperature is lowered at a fixed density .",
    "surprisingly , these are well described by the mode - coupling theory , implying that the high density and one - component gcm is more amenable to the mean - field picture of the glass transition than other typical glass formers .",
    "these observations call for more detailed analysis of the high density gcm at the low temperature regime . especially , it is tempting to consider gcm in the high density limit as the ideal and clean model system to study the glass transition .",
    "thermodynamic and structural characterization are prerequisites for dynamical study  @xcite but the detailed study is lacking .    in this work ,",
    "we numerically investigate thermodynamic and structural properties of the one - component gcm up to the density @xmath12 .",
    "we determine the solid - fluid phase boundary and show that the stillinger s scaling , eq .",
    "( [ st ] ) , holds at @xmath13 .",
    "thermodynamic and microscopic structural properties of gcm are also analyzed carefully over a wide range of temperature and density .",
    "the potential energy , pressure , thermal expansion coefficient , and the static structure factors are evaluated and compared with the prediction of the liquid state theory .",
    "surprisingly good agreement with the random phase approximation ( rpa ) is found for thermodynamic quantities for a wide range of temperature , including the low temperature regimes where the same approximation poorly describes the static structure factor and radial distribution function .",
    "this counterintuitive observation can be attributed to the ultra - soft nature of gcm for which the microscopic structure near the first shell of the system decouples with the macroscopic properties .",

    "ii , technical details of simulations and the method to compute the phase boundary are discussed . in section iii , we present simulation results for the phase diagram , thermodynamic quantities , and structural functions .",
