    "<S> for @xmath0 , we have found a total number of 1268 solutions to the erds - sierpiski problem finding positive integer solutions of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the sum of the positive divisors of n. on the basis of that set of solutions the following empirical properties are enunciated : first , all the @xmath2 , @xmath3 being a solution , are divisible by @xmath4 ; second , the repetition of solutions leads to the formulation of a new problem : _ find the natural numbers @xmath3 such that @xmath5 for some positive integer @xmath6_. a third empirical property concerns the asymptotic behavior of the function of @xmath3 that gives the number of solutions for @xmath7 less or equal to @xmath3 , which we find to be as @xmath8 . finally some theorems related to the erds - sierpiski problem are enunciated and proved </S>"
