    "studying the stellar structure of the milky way has a long history , as early models based on star counts were already constructed by the likes of @xcite and @xcite . today we know that four ` components ' make for a sensible approximate description of the milky way stellar body , each with different structural , kinematic and population characteristics : the bulge , the thin and the thick disk , and the stellar halo .",
    "accurate determination of the properties of these components is a difficult undertaking , as it requires surveys with ( 1 ) sufficient sky coverage to assess the overall geometry , ( 2 ) sufficient depth for mapping stars to @xmath310 to 30 kpc , and ( 3 ) sufficient information ( e.g. , color - based luminosity estimates ) to obtain reasonable distance estimates for these stars .",
    "furthermore , the presence of dust in the plane of the disk clouds our view of most of the galaxy at wavelengths shorter than a few microns . for this reason ,",
    "most previous efforts to study milky way structure at low latitudes have used ( near-)infrared data , such as the work by @xcite based on data from the spacelab infrared telescope , or more recent work using 2mass data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the glimpse survey @xcite .",
    "while near - infrared surveys provide the only way of studying the low latitude regions , because they suffer much less from dust extinction , they are currently less sensitive than their optical counterparts and often rely on tracer populations with less accurate distances .    over the past few years , data from 2mass @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ;",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have played a key role in revolutionizing our empirical picture of the stellar components of the milky way .",
    "as the sdss survey avoided the galactic plane , much of the work using sdss data has focused away from the bulk of the milky way s stars to high galactic latitudes .",
    "nonetheless , @xcite have been able to constrain the structural parameters of the stellar halo and the thin and thick disk . beyond the global parameters ,",
    "these surveys have also led to the discovery of substructure in both the stellar disk @xcite and halo @xcite .",
    "this detailed substructure provides information on how the milky way formed and evolved ; as galaxies assemble through mergers and accretions of smaller systems , these events leave identifiable signatures in their structure and kinematics .",
    "this also has cosmological implications , as the structure of the dark halo and the interactions with dark subhalos can significantly influence the appearance of a galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we derive a new map of the stellar distribution in the milky way , in order to study the large - scale structure of the thick disk and stellar halo .",
    "though covering only the northern celestial hemisphere , and that only sparsely , this map covers both high and low latitudes and uses rigorously derived stellar distances .",
    "this map is based on one of the constituent projects of the extended sdss survey ( sdss ii ) , segue ( sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is an imaging and spectroscopic survey aimed at the study of the milky way and its stellar populations .",
    "whereas the main sdss survey avoided low galactic latitudes , segue imaging scans go through the galactic plane ( see figure [ fig : dataoverview ] ) , allowing a ` picket - fence ' view of the galaxy at these low latitudes .",
    "it is this deep , uniform data set that enables a systematic analysis of stellar structure as function of galactic latitude and longitude , which we base on color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) fitting techniques developed by @xcite .",
    "a crucial advantage of an analysis based on cmds is that they bypass the often ad - hoc and sometimes problematic choices of stellar ` tracers ' ( such as k - dwarfs or f - stars ) to delineate the structure .",
    "instead , this procedure results immediately in a mass - density map for stellar population components of , say , different metallicity .    to avoid having to fit the complex stellar population make - up of the thin disk , we in the end consider only stars that are more than 1 kpc away from the galactic mid - plane , and treat the thin disk as a small perturbation to our results . as",
    "segue is a northern hemisphere survey , it stays far away from the galactic bulge , which can be safely ignored .",
    "on the other hand , the resulting maps of stellar mass density in the thick disk and halo allow us to measure the structural parameters of these components .",
    "in addition , we show that subtracting a smooth galactic model reveals a wealth of substructure , especially at low latitudes , which we will study in detail in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : data ] describes the data used for our analysis , and  [ sec : cmdfitting ] describes the cmd - fitting techniques we utilize .",
    "the resulting stellar distributions are presented in  [ sec : results ] , where we also fit smooth galactic models to them , derive structural parameters , and look at deviations from the best fitting model .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "as part of the segue survey @xcite , ten 2.5-wide scans , crossing the galactic plane at fixed longitudes , were imaged in five passbands ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these data are available as part of sdss data release 7 ( dr7 , * ? ? ?",
    "an automated data reduction and analysis pipeline produces accurate astrometric and photometric measurements for all detected objects @xcite , reaching a photometric accuracy of 2% down to @xmath1822.5 and @xmath1922 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dataoverview ] shows the coverage of the scans between galactic latitudes of + 50  and @xmath2050 .",
    "most scans have some overlap with the sdss main survey or sdss legacy area in the north galactic cap , and we extract 2.5-wide strips of data from dr7 to extend the photometry to galactic latitudes of 85 . for the cmd fitting analysis",
    "we restrict ourselves to two bands , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these two bands are the most useful for our population / distance analysis because , among the three photometrically most sensitive bands ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , they combine to give the largest offset in magnitude between stellar main sequences of different metallicities .",
    "the segue imaging in dr7 have been photometrically calibrated following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "the procedure basically uses the overlap of the segue data scans with the legacy sdss imaging scans to solve for the photometric zero - points and flat - field co - efficients of the sdss 2.5 m camera system .",
    "this overlap generally occurs in uncrowded regions of sky ( @xmath21 ) even for scans which extend to cross the galactic plane .",
    "the photometric solution for the segue scans was done incrementally rather than globally after the global solution for all the sdss legacy scans .",
    "the accuracy of the photometry is estimated to be to about 1.5% in g , and r ( @xmath22 in color ) .",
    "2.2 of @xcite for more details on the segue imaging and calibration .",
    "we de - redden all data using the dust maps from @xcite , including the correction suggested by @xcite , provided through the sdss catalog server .",
    "as most of the dust is confined close to the galactic plane , it is in the foreground for all stars more distant than 1 kpc from the mid - plane which we employ in our analysis .    to illustrate the basis for our subsequent modeling , several de - reddened cmds drawn from different latitudes in the segue stripe at @xmath23=94are shown in figure [ fig : examplecmds ] .",
    "the most obvious difference between different latitudes is the variation in reddening , which ranges from an @xmath24 of up to several magnitudes very close to or in the plane of the galaxy to a few hundredths of a magnitude at high latitudes .",
    "once the reddening reaches several tenths of magnitudes ( e.g. , the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : examplecmds ] ) , the unaccounted differential reddening along the line of sight smears out the cmd features .",
    "for this reason , and because the dereddening itself is less reliable in high extinction regions , we exclude regions with @xmath250.25 from our analysis ; the excluded regions correspond to the three darkest shadings in fig .",
    "[ fig : dataoverview ] .",
    "hence , the two lower panels in figure [ fig : examplecmds ] are representative for the cmds used for this study .",
    "this cut in foreground extinction also means that we exclude the most crowded regions and thereby avoid possible problems due to crowding .    before carrying out a more formal cmd analysis ,",
    "it is instructive to describe the main features seen in the cmds and to realize which kind of stars they contain . figure [ fig : isochrones ] shows the number density of stars in bins in the color - magnitude plane , or hess diagram , of all stars in the segue scan at @xmath23=94  and @xmath2630 .",
    "the large concentration of stars in the lower right , i.e. at faint magnitudes and centered at a @xmath27 color of @xmath31.4 consists of nearby , intrinsically faint and low - mass dwarf stars in the disk .",
    "the other plume of stars at @xmath280.4 is where the main - sequence turn - off ( msto ) stars of old ( @xmath2910 gyr ) stellar populations lie .",
    "a shift in the average color of this plume of stars is visible around @xmath3018 .",
    "this is caused by the difference in metallicity between the thick disk , which dominates at brighter magnitudes , and the galactic halo , which dominates at larger distances .",
    "the color of the msto is a useful proxy for the metallicity of the dominant population at a given distance ( e.g. see the discussion about this for sdss isochrones in * ? ? ?",
    "assuming a regular and smooth milky way , the main change between different latitudes are the relative contributions of ( thick ) disk and halo stars to the cmd . for example , comparing the cmds corresponding to latitudes of 30  and 70  ( lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : examplecmds ] ) shows how the number of disk stars decreases with respect to the halo stars .",
    "the field at 70  latitude adds complexity to this description , as it contains an example of stellar substructure ; the main - sequence feature produced by the sagittarius stream is readily visible , running from ( @xmath14-@xmath15,@xmath14)@xmath31(0.2,20.0 ) to ( 0.5,22.0 ) .    for our analysis of stellar structure",
    "we divide the 2.5-wide segue stripes into bins of 1width in latitude from which cmds are created .",
    "is then analysed as described in the next section .",
    "in most applications of cmd fitting , observed photometry is compared with models in order to determine which combination of simple stellar populations best resembles the data , thereby providing a model of the star formation history ( sfh ) and age - metallicity relation ( amr ) . for the work presented here , we fit model stellar population cmds based on the isochrones in sdss filters provided by @xcite to the segue photometry .",
    "the software package we use for this ( match , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) uses a maximum - likelihood method to determine the best linear combination of models , after transforming both models and data to hess diagrams ( 2d histograms of stars in the color - magnitude plane ) , enabling a pixel - by - pixel comparison . for a proper comparison",
    "the models need to be convolved with a realistic photometric error and completeness model .",
    "the model we use here is the same as in @xcite , based on the photometric errors from the sdss pipeline @xcite and the completeness determined from a comparison between sdss and combo-17 .",
    "since foreground reddening precludes the use of the most crowded regions in the mid - plane , crowding does not significantly affect the completeness in the data used here .    rather than determining the sfh and amr ,",
    "our aim in the present context is to map the structure of the stellar populations in the inner and outer milky way . for this",
    ", we use the distance - fitting option of match , described and tested in @xcite . to limit the number of free parameters and parameter degeneration in the fits",
    ", we define a small set of template stellar populations .",
    "the choice of templates is motivated both by the populations we expect to be present in the outer disk and inner halo , and by the cmd features we have to fit . as discussed in  [ sec : data ] , the most obvious indicator of population differences will be the msto color , which means the templates should span the expected color range , preferably in regular intervals .",
    "the msto color of a stellar population depends both on its age and metallicity , but since both the thick disk and the halo stellar populations are known to be old , we choose to use a fixed age range and use metallicity offsets to probe the msto color range .",
    "we adopt three different metallicity bins , [ fe / h]=@xmath200.7 , @xmath201.3 and @xmath202.2 , respectively .",
    "all template populations have the same age range of 10.1@xmath32log[t / yrs]@xmath3210.2 , and an assumed binary fraction of 0.5 . for convenience ,",
    "we choose a nomenclature for these components that is based on previous work : we refer to [ fe / h]=@xmath200.7 as a thick - disk - like population and , following @xcite , refer to the [ fe / h]=@xmath201.3 and @xmath202.2 templates as the two halo populations , namely , an inner - halo - like and outer - halo - like population , respectively .",
    "note , however , that in our subsequent analysis this choice of terms neither immediately prejudges the geometry , nor implies that these components are ` distinct ' .",
    "we simply presume that these three components are sufficient to completely describe the stellar populations at any point that is at least 1 kpc above or below the galactic mid - plane .",
    "isochrones corresponding to these population templates are overplotted on figure [ fig : isochrones ] .",
    "the colors of the msto of populations 1 and 2 match the color of the prominent upper and lower plume of msto stars in figure [ fig : isochrones ] , respectively , while the third population has a bluer msto . using a coarse grid of metallicities",
    "means that for stars with a metallicity different from any of the template populations a discrepant distance is inferred , as the brightness of the ms depends is metallicity dependent ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : isochrones ] ) .",
    "the magnitude offsets in this case are @xmath30.3 and @xmath30.5 magnitudes , going from the highest ( [ fe / h]=@xmath200.7 ) to the lowest metallicity ( [ fe / h]=@xmath202.2 ) isochrone . as stars with intermediate metallicities",
    "will be interpolated between the template populations , this translates into distance uncertainties of at most 10% .",
    "the other contributions to the distance uncertainty are inaccuracies in the isochrones and the photometric uncertainties , both of which are expected to be much smaller .",
    "the overall distance uncertainty is therefore of order 10% .",
    "we deliberately choose to avoid fitting the thin disk , because a template population with more typical thin - disk populations should have a large range in age and metallicity and would be difficult to distinguish from a combination of the three templates described above . hence , when presenting and interpreting our results , we will ignore the distance ranges where the thin disk is expected to be an important contribution to the star counts , and only consider regions with @xmath331.0 kpc , or roughly four thin - disk scale heights .    all stars with 15@xmath3421.5 , 15@xmath3521.0 and 0.1@xmath36-@xmath370.8 are used in the fits , with hess diagram pixel sizes of 0.07 in color and 0.2 in magnitude .",
    "this resolution is sufficient to resolve the features on which the analysis depends , but still ensures sufficient signal - to - noise per pixel .",
    "the color - cut of @xmath14-@xmath370.8 eliminates the issue of fitting the faint , red thin - disk stars . for each of the templates , model cmds",
    "are created for a range of distance moduli .",
    "the magnitude limits used in the fits ( 15@xmath3421.5 ) correspond to distance limit for msto stars of roughly 1.5@xmath3825 kpc .",
    "since the msto stars provide the best constraints for these cmd fits , only this distance range will be analysed .",
    "however , to avoid edge effects , model templates are created for distance moduli between 5.0 ( 100 pc ) to 20.0 ( 100 kpc ) in steps of 0.2 mag ( @xmath310% distance bins ) .",
    "match then determines the best - fitting combination of model cmds .",
    "subsequently , the uncertainties on the obtained results are determined by refitting monte carlo realizations of each cmd drawn from its best - fit model , as described in @xcite .",
    "it is again important to note the difference between this approach and using stars of a particular spectral type to make 3d maps of the milky way ( as in e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". the cmd fitting will give a direct , high signal - to - noise map of the stellar mass density , even if the stellar populations are spatially varying .",
    "this approach also utilizes the information for stars of different spectral types ( colors , luminosities ) simultaneously .",
    "a comparison of the best - fit model with the cmd data for the region at @xmath23=94  and @xmath39=+30  ( the same field as shown the lower left panel in figure [ fig : examplecmds ] ) is presented in figure [ fig : examplehess ] .",
    "although the model is not perfect ( which perhaps should not be expected due to the simple model population make - up ) , the general features of the density distribution are well - reproduced .",
    "the mean residuals are 25% of the mean star counts across the portion of the cmd used in the fit .",
    "rather than the stellar mass or the number of stars , the cmd fitting software provides the star formation rate ( sfr ) in m@xmath40yr@xmath41 corresponding to each population template for each distance modulus bin .",
    "however , these sfrs can easily be converted to the spatial stellar mass density using @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the star formation rate in @xmath44 of template population @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the width of the age bin , @xmath47 is the solid angle in steradian corresponding to each cmd , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the distances corresponding to the limits of the distance modulus bin .",
    "the 2001 match version uses a single power - law initial mass function ( imf ) . in this analysis",
    "we opt for a salpeter imf @xcite with cutoffs at 0.1 and 120 m@xmath40 , which yields a total mass of about a factor 2 higher than currently favored imfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for old populations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it should also be kept in mind that these masses correspond to the total mass of stars formed , which , especially for old populations , does not correspond to the total mass in stars today , but rather to the total mass in both stars and stellar remnants .    figure [ fig : densities ] shows the stellar mass densities obtained from the cmd fits for each of the stripes , summed over all three metallicities . figure [ fig : populations ] shows the same , but with a color - coding that represents the relative contributions of the three different template populations . generally speaking ,",
    "the stellar density decreases in a continuous fashion with increasing distance from the galactic center and plane , although some deviations are noticeable .",
    "for example , a region of apparent excess density extends to the bottom of the @xmath23=94  panel in figure [ fig : densities ] , caused by the sagittarius stream @xcite .",
    "the contributions of the three different template populations change as expected . with increasing distance from the sun , the ` thick disk ' , ` inner halo ' and `",
    "outer halo ' populations dominate in turn .",
    "the galactocentric distance where the metal - poor ` outer halo ' starts dominating over the more metal - rich inner halo varies between 10 and 20 kpc .",
    "figure [ fig : densitygraphs ] shows the mean density and mass - weighted metallicity as a function of distance from the sun for a set of different bins in galactic latitude .",
    "apart from the total mass density , the contributions from the individual template populations are also plotted .",
    "the increasing contribution of the thick disk to the density along lines of sight with decreasing latitude is clearly visible , both in the density graphs and in the steepness of the metallicity gradient at distances less than 10 kpc .",
    "the metallicity graphs indicate that the stellar halo has an average metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath501.6 at distances less than @xmath315 kpc , confirming the findings of @xcite , but then drops to [ fe / h]@xmath512 further out .",
    "although the transition is smooth , and both ` halo - like ' template populations contribute to the mass density at every distance , such a drop is consistent with the presence of two distinct populations , as predicted by @xcite",
    ". recall , however , that the transitions between different templates can only be taken as direct evidence of a metallicity gradient in the halo , if age differences between halo stars play no role in their turn - off color . for the thick disk and stellar halo",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , as both are generally believed to be relatively old ( @xmath2910 gyr ) , so that the isochrones are much less sensitive to age differences than to metallicity differences .",
    "the stellar density values , @xmath52 , are also presented in table [ tab : densities ] . as the table contains 25476 rows ,",
    "only the first five rows are printed , with the complete table available in electronic form online .",
