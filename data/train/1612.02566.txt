    "metastable molecules are formed due to collision of two atoms , when the energy of a bound molecular state in a closed channel is close to the energy of two atoms in the center of mass in an open channel .",
    "the weak coupling between the channels leads to the strong mixing of them , and the resulting metastable molecular states , which called the feshbach resonances @xcite , will have a finite lifetime and will decay both in the initial channel and in the other channels . the process of formation if intermediate metastable molecular states can be controlled , in particular , by the external magnetic field by the change of the resonance detuning , when the bound state in a closed channel has the different hyperfine state then the incoming atoms in the open channel . in this case",
    ", the difference between the hyperfine states , which is caused by the difference in the zeeman shifts , can be controlled by the detuning of the feshbach resonance by means of the magnetic field @xcite . in case where magnetically tunable resonances are absent , an alternative method for control of feshbach resonance is the optical method [ 5 ] ( optical feshbach resonance ) .",
    "optical control of feshbach resonances by means of quantum interference was proposed in work @xcite .    in the theory of resonant collision , in addition to feshbach method @xcite , which has been developed for studies of nuclear reactions and is successfully applied for collision atoms in bec , there is an alternative fano approach @xcite exists exploiting the configuration interaction in multielectron atoms .",
    "both approaches assume appearance of resonance phenomena when discrete states are coupled with continuum .",
    "fano technique is usually associated with asymmetry of shapes of resonance lines which is known in atomic physics as `` fano profile '' .",
    "similar interference phenomena of asymmetry of resonance line shape are also observed in nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "fano technique is , however , used not only in atomic physics for , e.g. , studies of autoionization and rydberg states [ 9 ] , resonance ionization of atoms @xcite , and laser induced continuum structures ( lics ) @xcite .",
    "the fano technique is also used for considerations of resonant collision [ 9 ] including those of electrons with atoms with formation of negative ions and interference phenomena in the field of laser radiation @xcite .",
    "fano technique is widely used in also other fields of physics .",
    "it is , e.g. , used for explanation of asymmetry in the absorption impurity ions in crystals , which is caused by for formation of excitonic resonances @xcite . with use of these resonances works @xcite , study the phenomenon of storage and reconstruction of quantum information in solids .",
