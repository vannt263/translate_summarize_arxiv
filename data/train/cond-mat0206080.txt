    "stabilized zirconias are materials of outstanding technological importance  @xcite .",
    "pure zirconia ( zro@xmath0 ) is monoclinic ( @xmath3 ) at zero temperature ( space group @xmath4 , ref .  ) ; upon increase of the temperature ( at zero pressure ) the material transforms to tetragonal ( @xmath5 ) and then to a cubic ( @xmath6 ) fluorite structure ( space groups @xmath7 and _ fm_3_m _ , respectively ) .",
    "@xcite these phase transitions induce large volume changes and make the pure material unsuitable for applications .",
    "the addition of lower - valence oxides like cao , mgo , or y@xmath0o@xmath1 disfavour the @xmath3 phase , stabilizing more symmetric structures with cubic and tetragonal symmetry .",
    "@xcite on increasing dopant concentration , the material transforms to a tetragonal ( @xmath8 ) form , called partially stabilized , and then to a cubic ( @xmath9 ) one , called fully stabilized .",
    "the amount of doping needed for stabilization is quite substantial ( no less than 8 % mol y@xmath0o@xmath1 to achieve full stabilization  @xcite ) , and the electrostatic neutrality of this rather ionic material is maintained by oxygen vacancies . in this case one vacancy is required for every two yttrium ions .",
    "the simultaneous presence of dopant cations and oxygen vacancies in large concentration means that the local atomic environments in the stabilized material are very different from the corresponding stoichiometric ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) phases . despite the analogy in the sequences @xmath3@xmath5@xmath6 and @xmath3@xmath8@xmath9",
    ", there is no clear picture of the microscopic mechanisms of stabilization to parallel our understanding of the pure material : the most relevant issue concerns the respective roles of impurity cations and of oxygen vacancies  @xcite .",
    "we address this issue by means of a self - consistent tight - binding model , which was parameterized on the electronic and structural properties of pure zirconia  @xcite .",
    "the method was used to calculate the temperature evolution of the free energy surfaces governing the @xmath10 phase transition , which was then described within the landau theory of phase transformations  @xcite .",
    "these results are the starting point for the present approach to the stabilization mechanism , which is based on the qualitative analogy between isothermal and isoconcentration lines in the high - temperature region of the zro@xmath0-y@xmath0o@xmath1 phase - diagram . at fixed concentration , higher temperatures",
    "destabilize the tetragonal phases @xmath5 and @xmath8 , favouring the cubic ones @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , at fixed temperature , higher amount of impurities stabilize the cubic phases .",
    "the position of the oxygen vacancy which is associated with each pair of y atoms has been a subject of some discussion . even though there are experimental data supporting the case in which y is nearest neighbor ( nn ) to the vacancy  @xcite , the most recent experiments  @xcite suggest that y is next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) to the vacancy .",
    "first - principles calculations  @xcite agree with the latter result , showing that the y nnn position is energetically favoured by 0.34 ev with respect to the nn position .",
    "@xcite the analysis of li and coworkers  @xcite suggests that the y atoms have a composition - independent 8 fold coordination shell ( like in the perfect fluorite structure @xmath6 ) in both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 lattice types , further supporting the hypothesis that the dopants are on average nnn to the vacancies .",
    "the presence of oxygen vacancies , together with the y in the nnn position , reduces the average coordination number of the zirconium atoms from 8 , as in the @xmath6 structure , to values closer to 7 , similar to the @xmath3 phase .",
    "besides the fact that the y atoms are 8-fold coordinated in both the stabilized structures , on the basis of the @xmath13 edge in x - ray - absorption spectra , li and coworkers  @xcite conclude that the perturbation in the neighborhood of the dopant cations is small and short - ranged .    from these considerations",
    ", it is tempting to propose a physical picture in which the dopant cations , located in fluorite - like cation lattice sites nnn to the vacancies , do not take an active part in the stabilization mechanism , which is dominated by the crystal distortions around the oxygen vacancies .",
    "we now investigate the consequences of this hypothesis , by neglecting altogether the presence of the dopant atoms , therefore isolating the role played by oxygen vacancies in the stabilization of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 forms of zirconia .    in section  [ isolvac ] ,",
    "the model is shown to reproduce the local atomic and electronic structure around an isolated oxygen vacancy predicted by first - principles calculations .",
    "the atomistic structures resulting from modelling partially and fully stabilized zirconia are then presented in secion  [ stab ] , and the results are discussed in section  [ disc ] .",
    "final remarks and a summary are made in section  [ concl ] .",
    "as a preliminary step towards the modelling of stabilized zirconia , the structural and electronic properties of a model crystal structure containing an isolated oxygen vacancy are first addressed .",
    "the same system was studied from first principles by stapper and coworkers :  @xcite a cubic 96-sites super - cell of 95 atoms in the fluorite structure containing one vacant oxygen lattice site , that we define as v@xmath14 .",
    "the vacancy is in the @xmath15 charge state ( one o@xmath16 ion missing ) . in the real material , the charge of the @xmath17 defect",
    "is compensated by the dopant substitutional cations @xmath18 . in our analysis",
    ", we mimic the presence of the charge - compensating y atoms by distributing their charge over the 32 zr cations , so that the cell is electrostatically neutral .",
    "the electronic structure in the neighborhood of the vacancy is described by the dangling orbitals of its neighbouring atoms .",
    "we define as _ unrelaxed _ the configuration in which all the atoms are in the centro - symmetric fluorite positions , and as _ relaxed _ the crystal structure resulting from the static optimization of the atomic coordinates .    as the crystal is allowed to relax the zr atoms nn to the vacancy radially shift outward along @xmath2 directions , and the first shell of anions around the vacancy ( nn o atoms ) contract inward along @xmath19 directions .",
    "this relaxation pattern is driven by the electrostatics and is shown in figure  [ disp ] .",
    "the atomic displacements predicted by the sc - tb are compared to the first - principles results  @xcite in table  [ tab ] .",
    "it may be noticed how the first - principles structural relaxations are well reproduced by the sc - tb model , _ without _ the inclusion of extra adjustable parameters .",
    "figure  [ dos ] shows the total density of states ( dos ) calculated with the sc - tb model for both the relaxed and unrelaxed configurations .",
    "the dos are plotted with respect to the energy of the highest occupied level . because of the choice of the reference energy , the valence 2@xmath20 oxygen bands have negative energies . above the bandgap ,",
    "it is possible to identify the crystal field splitting of the zirconium @xmath21 bands . in the undistorted case ( left panel )",
    ", the arrow points to a sharp peak within the bandgap , also predicted by other calculations .",
    "@xcite the corresponding partial dos shows that this peak corresponds to the nn zr @xmath21 bands with symmetry @xmath22 .",
    "the atomic relaxation ( right panel ) shifts the isolated peak back into the conduction band , as predicted by first principles calculations .",
    "@xcite    these results of the sc - tb model may be interpreted by considering the perturbation in the periodic electrostatic ( madelung ) potential in the stoichiometric @xmath6 structure caused by the presence of an oxygen vacancy @xmath23 .",
    "this defect increases the madelung potential on the neighbouring sites , thereby lowering the energy of the @xmath21 states of the zr ions nn to the vacancy with respect to the @xmath21 states of the bulk zr ions far from the defect .",
    "this perturbation in the madelung potential at the nearest neighbour zr sites is responsible for the isolated peak in the bandgap of the unrelaxed defective structure , marked by the arrow in figure 2 .",
    "the atomic relaxation effectively restores the homogeneity of the madelung potential in the neighbourhood of the vacancy , pushing the nn zr @xmath21 levels back upwards .",
    "the study of the stabilization mechanism is based on static and dynamic simulations of two 96-site super - cells which were chosen as representative systems .",
    "the first one , denoted as v@xmath14 , contains one vacancy .",
    "this system corresponds to 3.2% mol y@xmath0o@xmath1 and therefore it should be in the field of stability of the @xmath12 phase .",
    "similarly , the second super - cell v@xmath24 contains 4 vacancies and corresponds to 14.4% mol y@xmath0o@xmath1 , which is in the phase - field of fully stabilized zirconia @xmath11 .",
    "the electrostatic neutrality of the super - cells was ensured by distributing the compensating ionic charge of the dopant atoms over the 32 zr cations . for each system ,",
    "two separate sets of calculations were carried out : static relaxations and molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "the dynamics of the systems were simulated for 25 ps with a time - step of 5 fs , constraining the temperature at 300 k with a nos - hoover thermostat  @xcite .",
    "the static minimization of the v@xmath14 super - cell has already been described .",
    "further analysis of the structure reveals that the atomic configuration obtained in section  [ isolvac ] is metastable , corresponding to a saddle point in the potential energy . by perturbing the relaxed configuration obtained in section  [ isolvac ]",
    ", a secondary structural modification further lowers the total energy of the cell , similar to the tetragonal distortion of the oxygen sublattice in pure stoichiometric @xmath6 zirconia ( soft @xmath25 mode of vibration ) .    according to the energy surface governing the @xmath10 relationship ,",
    "@xcite the internal tetragonal distortion of the oxygen sublattice drives the external tetragonal distortion of the unit - cell . as a consequence , the relaxed configuration is expected to be further minimized by a non unitary @xmath26 ratio . indeed , allowing the tetragonality of the cell to adjust ,",
    "the minimum energy is obtained for @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding equilibrium structure is shown in figure  [ psz ] .",
    "the anions and cations are represented with light and dark circles respectively and the arrows point to the oxygen column containing the vacancy , which is behind the first visible oxygen ion .",
    "the projection on the @xmath28 plane ( left ) shows the same pattern obtained with the static minimization .",
    "the nn cations move away from the vacancy and the nn anions contract inward .",
    "the right panel shows the projection along the @xmath29 plane : the tetragonal distortion of the oxygen sublattice is very clear .",
    "note the perturbation in the neighborhood of the vacancy arising from the superposition of the tetragonal distortion and the vacancy - induced radial displacement field .",
    "the md simulation of the v@xmath14 super - cell shows that this atomic structure is stable and does not undergo any further structural modification . the atomic configuration obtained by averaging",
    "the atomic positions over the last 20 ps coincide with the one obtained with the static minimization , shown in figure  [ psz ] .",
    "the similarity between the @xmath12 and @xmath5 structures is also evident from the radial distribution function ( rdf ) shown in figure  [ rdf2 ] . in agreement with the experimental measurements",
    "@xcite , the splitting of the first peak in the zr - o rdf , a sign of the oxygen sublattice being tetragonally distorted , is also present in the rdf of the @xmath12 phase .",
    "the first peak in the o - o rdf is exactly the same in both the tetragonal phases , while the disorder introduced by the vacancy slightly modifies the second o - o coordination shell .",
    "the zr - zr rdf indicates that the cation sublattice is nearly @xmath30 .",
    "arrows in figure  [ rdf2 ] indicate the available experimental values for 3% and 15% mol y@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 phase was modelled by distributing four vacancies in the super - cell . here",
    "we consider two possible high - symmetry vacancy configurations . in the first one ,",
    "the vacancies were distributed in the cell by maximizing the defect - defect separation , by setting the four vacancies on a @xmath30 lattice , with a defect - defect distance of @xmath31 ( @xmath32=9.61 a.u.=5.09   is the lattice constant of the cubic structure ) . in the second configuration ,",
    "the four vacancies were aligned along the @xmath2 direction , with a defect - defect minimum distance of @xmath33 .",
    "the sc - tb model shows that the second configuration is more stable than the first one by 0.1 ry per super - cell .",
    "it therefore predicts the clustering of vacancies along the @xmath2 direction , as observed experimentally  @xcite and from first - principles calculations .",
    "@xcite the results for the most stable of the two vacancy configurations , which we refer to as the @xmath34 super - cell , are described in what follows .",
    "the static relaxation was started with all the atoms in the fluoritic centro - symmetric positions . in this case , only one structural modification was observed .",
    "the system evolved towards the atomic configuration shown in figure  [ fsz ] .",
    "the local distortions around the vacancies lock the @xmath11 crystal in a distorted configuration , suppressing the tetragonal distortion of the oxygen sublattice . the same structure",
    "was then obtained by md simulation of the v@xmath24 super - cell .",
    "the local atomic environment is very different from that of the fluorite structure : 14 cations out of 32 are 7 fold coordinated and the majority of the oxygen ions are not in centro - symmetric positions .",
    "the minimum energy is obtained for a perfect cubic super - cell ( @xmath35 ) .    despite these distortions",
    ", the rdf shown in figure  [ rdf2 ] suggests that the structure of the v@xmath24 is , on average , cubic .",
    "the first peak of the zr - o component confirms that the oxygen sublattice is not tetragonally distorted .",
    "the calculated average zr - o distance compares very well with the experimental one in 15% mol yttria stabilized zirconia  @xcite , shown by the arrow . in the tetragonal structures ,",
    "the o - o second coordination shell shows a characteristic three - peaked rdf .",
    "the corresponding rdf of the @xmath11 phase , shows only a single peak centered at @xmath36 a.u .",
    ", which is the second shell o - o distance in the perfect cubic lattice . because of the outward displacement of the large number of zr atoms nn to the vacancies ,",
    "the first zr - zr peak is shifted to smaller @xmath37 , which is also experimentally observed ( see arrow in figure  [ rdf2]c ) .",
    "apart from this detail , the zr - zr rdf shows complete similarity with the other cases and therefore the zr sublattice is @xmath30 , even in the v@xmath24 supercell .",
    "our results corroborate some of the early experimental observations on stabilized zirconia and on other compounds with the general formula m@xmath38o@xmath39 .",
    "@xcite these reported a strong distortion of the oxygen sublattice , with the nn o atoms relaxing towards the vacancy by @xmath40 0.3   and the nn zr relaxing away from the vacancy by less than 0.2  .",
    "@xcite moreover , in the special case of the zr@xmath1m@xmath24o@xmath39 compounds , the difference between the ordered and disordered fluorite structures was determined by the arrangement of the oxygen vacancies ,  @xcite which where reported to lie along the [ 111 ] directions .",
    "@xcite    when the results described in the previous sections are considered in the context of the @xmath41 phase transition in pure zirconia ,  @xcite they also provide insight on how the structural distortions around the oxygen vacancies affect the relative stability of the tetragonal and cubic phases .",
    "the relationship between the @xmath6 and @xmath5 forms is governed by a temperature - dependent double - well in the potential energy . at low temperature ,",
    "the cubic phase @xmath6 is structurally unstable and it lowers the energy by distorting the oxygen sublattice along the @xmath25 mode of vibration .",
    "the extent of this distortion is measured by the order parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the 0 k double - well for the @xmath10 structures is shown in figure  [ dw ] by a solid line labelled @xmath5 .",
    "the static relaxations showed that both the unrelaxed cells v@xmath14 and v@xmath24 are unstable with respect to the short - range isotropic relaxation around the vacancies .",
    "moreover , our atomistic simulations suggest that the v@xmath14 cell is also unstable with respect to the tetragonal distortion .",
    "let us now simply superimpose these two displacement fields to see how the oxygen vacancies , considered as centers of dilations , modifies the energy double - well . in the following ,",
    "the statically relaxed configurations of v@xmath14 and v@xmath24 which show the radial displacements only , are taken as reference systems , to which we apply the tetragonal distortion @xmath42 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ dw ] .    similarly to the @xmath6 structure ,",
    "the defective v@xmath14 cell is unstable with respect to the tetragonal distortion : the atomic relaxations around the vacancy partially reduce the height and width of the double well ( figure  [ dw ] ) . a static minimization from the minimum of the double - well leads to the same structure obtained by averaging over the md configurations ( figure  [ psz ] ) , and showing that the finite - temperature equilibrium configuration is not just a superposition of the two displacement fields .",
    "on the other hand , the reference v@xmath24 cell is stable with respect to the tetragonal distortion of the oxygen sublattice and there is no double - well in the total energy ( figure  [ dw ] ) .",
    "the energy profile is highly anharmonic , just as the high - temperature one in the free - energy for the pure phase  @xcite .",
    "this means that in our model for @xmath9 , it is possible to shift entire column of oxygen atoms by 5 - 10 % of the zr - o interatomic distance at no energy cost , with important implications for the mobility of defects and therefore for transport phenomena in stabilized zirconia .",
    "we know from our previous simulations , and it is not surprising , that in a flat well of this form the average structure at finite temperature is cubic .",
    "in conclusion , partially and fully stabilized zirconia were modelled by introducing respectively one and four vacancies in 96-site cubic super - cell ( v@xmath14 and v@xmath24 , respectively ) .",
    "energetics and atomic structures of the defective super - cells were calculated with a sc - tb model which was parameterized on the properties of pure stoichiometric zirconia .",
    "the analysis of the v@xmath14 and v@xmath24 equilibrium crystal structures suggests a possible explanation of the stabilization mechanism .",
    "when the concentration of vacancies is low , as in the v@xmath14 super - cell , a relatively large volume of crystal is left in the fluorite structure , and it undergoes the tetragonal distortion just as the stoichiometric material in the @xmath6-phase would . because this distortion involves the coordinated motion of all the oxygens , also the atoms neighboring the defects are dragged along the tetragonal distortion of the oxygen sublattice ( see figure  [ psz ] ) .",
    "when the concentration of defects is high , as in the v@xmath24 super - cell , there is virtually no undistorted cubic region in the statically relaxed super - cell ; every oxygen atom is either itself a neighbor of a vacant site , or at least four of its six neighboring oxygen atoms are .",
    "thus there is virtually no region in which the local atomic environment is close to fluorite , which could undergo the tetragonal distortion ( see figure  [ fsz ] ) , and the radial distortions around the vacancies dominate the finite - temperature equilibrium configuration .",
    "the resulting atomic structure is cubic only by averaging over relatively large number of atoms ( @xmath43 100 ) , but the short - range atomic structure does not have cubic symmetry .",
    "these results show that the stabilization of the @xmath12 and @xmath11 structures may be achieved in theory by doping zirconia crystals with oxygen vacancies only , and support the idea that the electronic and structural properties of stabilized zirconia are controlled by the structural disorder around the oxygen vacancies , rather than by the substitutional dopant cations .",
