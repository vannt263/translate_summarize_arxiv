    "it has been shown@xcite that suspended graphene can achieve very high mobilities since various annealing techniques can remove much of the extrinsic impurities unavoidably present in graphene on substrates@xcite .",
    "such ultrapure graphene ( in this article , graphene would mostly imply suspended graphene without any substrates ) with ultrahigh mobility is of considerable importance for a number of reasons .",
    "first , a careful comparison between graphene experimental data with and without substrates could inform the community a great deal about the type of disorder operational in graphene on various substrates and the associated scattering mechanisms limiting graphene mobility on substrates @xcite , thus helping the eventual technological application of graphene based devices .",
    "second , ultrapure suspended graphene enables the study of interaction effects @xcite without the considerable complications arising from disorder , and additionally , the absence of dielectric screening by the substrate enhances the coulomb interaction .",
    "third , as a direct consequence of the high sample purity , suspended graphene is a convenient system for the experimental study of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "fourth , the ( relative ) absence of disorder in suspended graphene ( sg ) suppresses the electron - hole puddle formation around the charge - neutrality point ( cnp ) , i.e. , the dirac point , making it relatively easier to access the intrinsic dirac point physics by lowering the carrier density @xcite .    the last item ( `` accessing the dirac point '' ) along with the first item ( `` understanding transport in sg '' ) provide the motivation of our theoretical research presented in the current paper , where we carry out a detailed quantitative study of sg carrier transport as a systematic function of temperature and carrier density neglecting all complications arising from the inhomogeneous electron - hole puddles @xcite in the system ( which typically become operational below a typical carrier density @xmath0 @xmath1 for graphene on sio@xmath2 substrates@xcite ) .",
    "our theoretical results provide a direct estimate of the disorder - limited sg transport properties down to low carrier densities which experiments should be able to access in clean sg samples where inhomogeneous puddle formation is pushed down to very low carrier densities .",
    "our work , therefore , should provide a benchmark for understanding sg transport data as well as for figuring out how close to the dirac point specific sg experimental samples manage to approach .",
    "a characteristic and universal feature of graphene transport is the minimum conductivity phenomenon where at some disorder - dependent low carrier density ( @xmath3 ) the conductivity shows an approximate saturation as a function of carrier density , forming a rough minimum conductivity plateau around the dirac point @xcite with a characteristic electron - hole density width of @xmath4 .",
    "the characteristic density cut - off @xmath3 defining this minimum conductivity plateau roughly defines how close in density [ or in energy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the graphene fermi energy for carrier density @xmath3 , and @xmath7 is the graphene fermi velocity ] the particular graphene sample approaches the dirac point .",
    "larger the @xmath3 ( or @xmath8 ) , further the system is from the dirac point no matter how low one tunes the gate voltage since the dirac point is defined only to the uncertainty of @xmath3 .",
    "it is now reasonably well - established@xcite that the minimum conductivity plateau and the characteristic density cut - off arises from disorder - induced density inhomogeneity ( or equivalently electron - hole puddle formation ) in the system which makes it impossible to access the dirac point nominally existing precisely at zero carrier density . instead the disorder - induced density fluctuations characterized by @xmath3 make the zero - density ( and as such , measure - zero ) dirac point ill - defined over a scale of @xmath3 .",
    "smaller @xmath3 is , closer one can approach the dirac point by tuning the gate voltage induced carrier density .",
    "thus , transport measurements , which probe @xmath3 directly by definition ( since for @xmath9 the conductivity approximately saturates ) provide a clear signature for how close to the dirac point one is able to approach in a particular graphene sample . in high - quality sg ,",
    "@xmath10 @xmath1 can be achieved@xcite , indicating that experiments can assess the dirac point within @xmath11 . with further improvement in sg sample quality ,",
    "it is conceivable that the sg dirac point could be accessed within 0.5k leading to the possibility of studying intrinsic interaction phenomenon associated with the non - fermi liquid aspects of the dirac point @xcite .",
    "this dirac point accessibility is the primary motivation for our detailed current study of sg transport properties as functions of carrier density and temperature . in this work",
    "we assume @xmath12 , and our results therefore only apply to ultrapure sg samples at doping densities above the conductivity minima and/or at @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the dirac point accessibility issue discussed above , a secondary motivation of our work is a qualitative theoretical understanding of realistic sg transport in order to assess whether the current experimental sg samples are in the ballistic or the diffusive regime .",
    "several recent sg experimental investigations @xcite conclude that their studied samples are in the ballistic regime based on the estimated transport mean free path being longer than ( or comparable to ) the linear sample size .",
    "such very long mean free paths imply essentially no carrier scattering within the sample ( and consequently , almost no disorder ) , and thus the issue of diffusive versus ballistic transport in sg samples is an important topic of considerable interest to the community .",
    "we find that this is also a very subtle topic since the extraction of the mean free path from the measured conductivity is quite nontrivial at low gate voltage ( i.e. , near the dirac point ) where intrinsic thermal carrier occupancy ( because of the zero band gap nature of graphene ) effects become crucial , and a nive estimate of the mean free path using simply the gate - induced carrier density would seriously over - estimate the mean free path .",
    "in fact , we believe that at low carrier densities it is much more sensible to discuss the physics simply in terms of the dimensionless 2d conductivity ( in units of @xmath14 ) rather than in terms of the mean free path and/or mobility which are both derived by dividing the measured conductivity by a putative carrier density subject to large errors near the cnp .",
    "we find that a theoretical description based on purely diffusive transport using the semi - classical drude - boltzmann theory gives a reasonable description for the experimentally observed sg transport properties .",
    "we believe that the only way to definitively establish ballistic sg transport is to experimentally observe the explicit sample size dependent conductivity characterizing ballistic transport where conductance and not conductivity is the meaningful physical quantity , which , to the best of our knowledge , has not yet been seen in any sg samples by any experimental group .",
    "we therefore contend , based on our theoretical results , that the currently existing sg samples are all high - mobility diffusive samples .",
    "we consider primarily disorder - induced resistive scattering in our theory @xcite since our interest is mainly the issue of approaching the dirac point in high - quality sg .",
    "the phonon effects have been considered elsewhere in details @xcite , and it is straightforward to include phonons in the theory , and we do provide some results including phonon scattering in the theory since their effect could be important at higher ( lower ) temperatures ( carrier densities ) .    the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe our basic transport model and provide the expected theoretical results for finite temperature drude transport of intrinsic ( i.e. undoped ) graphene precisely at the dirac point , which serves as the starting point for later discussions . in section",
    "iii we provide our full theory , and then in section iv we provide our numerical results , concluding in section v with a discussion and a summary .",
    "precisely at the dirac point ( @xmath15 ) , assuming no disorder - induced electron - hole puddles and @xmath16 , it is easy to see that the semiclassical drude - boltzmann conductivity @xmath17 at the dirac point ( or equivalently , the charge neutrality point ) is precisely zero ( i.e. infinite resistivity ) because of the trivial reason that there are no carriers to carry any current .",
    "we note that in our zeroth - order drude - boltzmann transport theory the matrix element of the off - diagonal terms vanishes due to the conservation of energy , which gives rise to the zero conductivity at t=0 and n=0 .",
    "but more rigorous transport theories ( such as kubo formula or self - consistent boltzmann transport theory which are beyond the boltzmann theory ) produce the non - vanishing matrix elements between off - diagonal terms even at n=0 .",
    "thus the well known minimum conductivity appears in these theories .",
    "since our analysis is totally based on the zeroth order boltzmann theory the conductivity vanishes for n=0 even for chiral graphene .",
    "this trivial result is unstable because there will be a finite conductivity the moment the carrier density deviates from the precise measure - zero @xmath15 constraint which is bound to happen at @xmath18 even at the dirac point by virtue of the low - energy thermal electron - hole excitations capable of carrying the current . unlike ordinary band insulators with finite band gaps @xcite , there is no exponential suppression of finite - temperature band conductivity in graphene because of its gaplessness .",
    "instead , as is well - known and discussed in some details below , @xmath19 at the dirac point of graphene manifests a power law `` insulating '' temperature dependence , which should distinguish the dirac point behavior from the saturated conductivity behavior in the presence of electron - hole puddles @xcite .",
    "this power - law `` insulating '' behavior associated with the dirac point has nothing to do with anderson localization physics and arises entirely within the metallic drude - boltzmann diffusive transport theory because graphene is a gapless semiconductor .",
    "consider undoped graphene in the absence of disorder ( or electron hole puddles ) , i.e. , the chemical potential at @xmath16 lies at the dirac point .",
    "then the thermally excited number of electrons ( and holes ) at finite temperatures can be calculated @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fermi distribution function and @xmath22 is the density of states of graphene with the total degeneracy @xmath23 arising from spin ( 2 ) and valley ( 2)and @xmath24 .",
    "the induced carrier density at @xmath25 becomes @xmath26 at @xmath27 we have @xmath28 @xmath1 .",
    "thus if the conductivity is simply proportional to the carrier density , it increases quadratically with temperature .",
    "we show below that the actual temperature dependence of conductivity depends on the scattering mechanism .    in",
    "the presence of disorder induced momentum scattering the conductivity can be calculated within boltzmann transport theory .",
    "in this theory the puddle effect is not considered i.e. , the theory is valid only for @xmath29 .",
    "the conductivity is given by @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the disorder induced transport scattering time .",
    "note that in this equation the conductivity is not related explicitly to the carrier density .",
    "if we assume a constant scattering time , i.e. no energy and temperature dependence of the scattering time , then we have , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the constant scattering time and the mean free path is given by @xmath34 .",
    "in this case the conductivity increases linearly with temperature .    now consider a generalized scattering time . within the fermi golden rule we have @xmath35",
    "is the impurity concentration and @xmath36 is the carrier - impurity scattering potential .    for a short range potential ( i.e. @xmath37-range potential ) with the strength @xmath38 and the impurity density @xmath39 we have @xmath40 with eq .  ( [ eq : sigma_b ] ) we have @xmath41 thus the conductivity is independent of the temperature for @xmath37-correlated zero - range disorder .",
    "for unscreened long ranged coulomb potential , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the background lattice dielectric constant ( taken to be unity for sg ) , we have @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the graphene fine structure coupling constant . with eq .",

    "finally , the conductivity can be calculated to be ( with some straightforward algebra ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a function which is independent of the temperature and given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59.\\ ] ] thus the dirac point conductivity increases quadratically with temperature for screened coulomb potential disorder similar to the bare coulomb disorder results in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_dt ] ) .",
    "finally , for scattering of the thermally excited carriers by the deformation potential coupling to the acoustic phonons@xcite we get the following expression in the high - temperature nondegenerate equipartition phonon distribution regime : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the deformation potential , @xmath62 the graphene mass density , and @xmath63 the phonon velocity .",
    "thus , the conductivity decreases inverse linearly with increasing temperature .",
    "for low temperatures , @xmath64 where the @xmath65 is the so - called bloch - grneisen temperature , phonon scattering is very strongly suppressed@xcite and is not of any interest in the current work .",
    "we note that , as expected , the above boltzmann theoretical semiclassical description of the dirac point conductivity , which neglects all interactions @xcite and interference effects @xcite ( but includes thermal excitation , screening , and scattering effects quantum - mechanically ) , gives @xmath66 at the dirac point , and the finite @xmath19 for @xmath67 arises entirely from the finite density of the thermal electron - hole excitations [ c.f . , eq .",
    "( [ den_t0 ] ) ] in gapless graphene .",
    "the temperature dependence of the finite - temperature dirac point conductivity is entirely a power law with @xmath68 where @xmath69 , 1 , 2 respectively depending on whether the scattering mechanism is short - ranged or energy - independent or long - ranged ( including screened coulomb scattering ) . in addition , @xmath70 for phonon scattering as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_ph ] ) , and in the presence of all possible scattering mechanisms , the actual temperature dependent dirac point conductivity would be nonuniversal and complex , depending on the strength of the various scattering processes in the particular sample .",
    "it is then easy to see that the experimentally measured @xmath71 exponent could be any number between 0 and 2 , depending on the manifestly non - universal strength of various scattering mechanisms in the system .     as a function of temperature .",
    "@xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) indicates the conductivity due to screened charged coulomb disorder with an impurity density @xmath74 [ short - range disorder with @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 represents the conductivity limited by acoustic phonon scattering .",
    "@xmath77 is the total conductivity including all scattering mechanisms .",
    "the dashed line indicates the conductivity due to the coulomb disorder and the short - range disorder .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] ]    the important point to note is that the temperature dependence is never exponential , a key qualitative feature which helps to distinguish the dirac point thermally induced conductivity from the anderson ( strong ) localization ( or gap - induced insulating ) behavior .",
    "this power - law temperature - dependence feature remains valid even in the presence of phonon scattering which leads to a metallic conductivity ( i.e. , a negative @xmath71 ) with a temperature - dependent conductivity with a power law between 1 and 5,@xcite depending on whether bloch - grneisen regime is relevant or not .",
    "we emphasize that phonons can only induce metallic behavior ( with the conductivity decreasing with increasing temperature ) , and as such disorder and phonon scattering together may produce a complicated non - monotonic temperature dependence . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] we show the calculated @xmath17 including all three scattering mechanisms ( i.e. short - range and long - range disorder as well as acoustic phonons ) .",
    "the total conductivity ( @xmath77 ) shows the non - monotonic temperature dependence .",
    "as temperature increases , @xmath77 increases due to the dominance of coulomb disorder at low temperatures , but after reaching a maximum conductivity it decreases with increasing temperature due to phonon scattering .",
    "this crossover temperature scale for @xmath78 depends sensitively on the amount of coulomb disorder in the system , and increases ( decreases ) with increasing ( decreasing ) coulomb disorder .",
    "we note that if coulomb disorder is weak or absent , @xmath78 decreases monotonically with increasing temperature because of phonon scattering .",
    "the fact that experimental low - density sg transport data @xcite show a nonmonotonic temperature dependence in the low - density sg conductivity clearly indicates that coulomb disorder dominates even the currently existing sg samples ( and not just the graphene on substrate samples ) .",
    "a key aspect of the temperature - dependent dirac point electrical conductivity derived above , which , although rather obvious , has not been much discussed in the literature , is that the intrinsic dirac point behavior is really a _ high - temperature _ phenomenon rather than a low - temperature one since one must have @xmath79 in order to see the intrinsic behavior ( where @xmath3 is the characteristic cut - off density defining electron - hole puddle formation in the system ) .",
    "thus , the intrinsic dirac point physics can only be accessed for @xmath80 with @xmath3 ( t ) measured in units of @xmath1 ( k ) , and the intrinsic dirac point behavior is completely suppressed by the extrinsic inhomogeneous carrier density fluctuations associated with the electron - hole puddles . for the extremely low value of @xmath10 @xmath1 , we get @xmath81 whereas for the usual graphene on sio@xmath2 substrates , where @xmath82 @xmath1 , @xmath83 ! thus , the intrinsic dirac point conductivity ( and its strongly insulating temperature dependence arising from coulomb disorder ) can never be observed in most graphene on sio@xmath2 samples studied in most laboratories , and indeed , in spite of clear theoretical predictions for the insulating temperature dependence of the low - density graphene conductivity@xcite , for a long time it was believed that graphene conductivity is essentially temperature independent upto room temperature ( since the electron - phonon coupling constant is small in graphene , even phonon - induce metallic temperature dependence is fairly weak in graphene at high carrier density ) .    to observe the intrinsic dirac point physics @xmath19 at low temperatures ( @xmath84 mk ) so that various predicted interaction induced dirac point reconstruction ( or instability )",
    "@xcite can be experimentally observed ( since higher temperature strongly suppresses interaction effects ) , one would have to produce sg samples of rather extraordinary purity with the puddle induced density inhomogeneity being less than @xmath85 @xmath1 .",
    "this seems to be a rather daunting task , and it is therefore safe to say that the @xmath86 intrinsic dirac point conductivity is unlikely to be experimentally explored in the near future , making our current work , where we consider finite - temperature dirac point transport neglecting interaction effects , to be relevant for all experimental dirac point transport studies in the near future .    before concluding this section we emphasize that we are only considering @xmath18 disorder - limited boltzmann conductivity in our theory , neglecting all interaction effects , and for @xmath16 our dirac point conductivity is trivially zero .",
    "a completely different approach is necessary to discuss intrinsic dirac point conductivity in clean graphene at @xmath16 where interaction and quantum interference effects would be important .",
    "such a theory is beyond the scope of our work and is not of interest to us since we know of no experimental relevance of the @xmath16 dirac point conductivity .",
    "second , the inclusion of phonon effects is extremely important for the dirac point conductivity behavior as a function of temperature since phonons lead to the non - monotonic @xmath19 with metallic behavior ( @xmath87 ) at higher temperatures replacing the insulating behavior ( @xmath88 ) at lower temperatures with a nonuniversal disorder - dependent crossover behavior .",
    "our theoretical model assumes the absence of puddles in the system , and as such , the theory is cut off at some samples - dependent characteristic carrier density @xmath3 below which the inhomogeneous density fluctuations around the dirac point become important , leading to an observable minimum conductivity plateau formation .",
    "the theory is valid only for @xmath89 or in the non - plateau regime by definition .",
    "if @xmath3 is very small , as has been claimed in several recent experimental studies @xcite , then our theory would apply down to very low carrier density ( as long as interference and interaction effects are negligible ) .",
    "puddle effects on graphene transport properties have been theoretically studied elsewhere @xcite , and puddles would introduce additional nontrivial temperature and density dependence for @xmath90 , which is not of interest to us in the current work where @xmath3 is very small by virtue of the ultra - clean nature of sg in general .    in our theory , we consider three distinct scattering mechanisms contributing to the sg resistivity .",
    "these are charged impurity , short - range disorder , and in - plane acoustic phonon scattering processes .",
    "there can be other types of scattering mechanisms contributing to the graphene resistivity such as resonant scattering centers @xcite , ripples @xcite , and flexural phonons @xcite .",
    "the short - ranged disorders considered in the resonant scatterers @xcite modify the density of states of graphene ( i.e. , there are a resonant dos peak at the dirac point due to the disorders ) . in this case",
    "the short - ranged disorder scattering gives rise to the density dependent conductivity . in our boltzmann theory , to keep the theory to be consistent for all other disorders we used the bare dos of pure graphene and we have the density independent conductivity from the short - range disorder . in this paper",
    "the short - range disorder represents the zero - range disorder , i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "the calculated scattering time with the finite width potential ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) does not significantly modify that with the zero - range potential as long as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the lattice constant of graphene . in suspended graphene",
    "the flexural phonons may dominate the phonon contribution to the resistivity @xcite .",
    "however , in suspended graphene under specific tension induced by contacts ( this is the case for all available suspended graphene samples ) the flexural phonon contribution to the conductivity is severely suppressed and as a consequence the in - plane phonon is the dominant scattering mechanism @xcite .",
    "since we consider suspended graphene under the tension our calculated results is not affected by the flexural phonons .",
    "the possibility of still other unknown scattering mechanisms ( such as scattering from the hybridization of electron - hole excitations and out - of - plane optical phonons @xcite ) contributing to the graphene resistivity can not be ruled out either .",
    "but we neglect these scattering mechanisms because we want to keep the number of parameters to a minimum and also because the very high sg mobility and quality imply that the overall scattering contributions are small .    the drude - boltzmann conductivity theory for extrinsic graphene in the presence of induced carriers is a straightforward generalization of the theory provided in sec .",
    "ii except the total carrier density now has an externally tunable ( through the gate voltage ) density in addition to the thermally excited intrinsic carriers considered in sec .",
    "this theory has been much discussed in the literature , and we provide below the working equations for different contributions to the sg resistivity from the three different scattering mechanisms considered in our work .",
    "the theory below is a straightforward generalization of the theory for the finite - temperature dirac point conductivity developed in the last section .    within the boltzmann transport theory @xcite , the conductivity @xmath95 is given within the relaxation time approximation by @xmath96,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the relevant distribution function .",

    "the finite temperature chemical potential , @xmath107 , is calculated self - consistently@xcite so that the net carrier density ( induced by doping or an external gate ) is @xmath108 , and the gaplessness of graphene automatically ensures that this procedure incorporates the thermally excited carriers ( i.e. , the only carriers present for intrinsic graphene as considered in sec .",

    "we note that the deformation potential coupling is rather weak in graphene , and therefore , the primary ( essentially , the only ) effect of phonon scattering is to introduce a weak metallic temperature dependence with the phonon - induced resistivity @xmath128 at higher temperatures @xmath129 , where @xmath63 is the phonon velocity ( i.e. speed of sound ) . since @xmath130",

    "we conclude by emphasizing that our results establish that how close in density one has approached the dirac point can be estimated by seeing how high in temperature the coulomb disorder induced insulating temperature dependence persists in a particular graphene sample ( or paradoxically , how low in temperature the acoustic phonon effects persist if the graphene sample is devoid of coulomb disorder causing the insulating behavior ) .",

    "<S> we theoretically consider , comparing with the existing experimental literature , the electrical conductivity of gated monolayer graphene as a function of carrier density , temperature , and disorder in order to assess the prospects of accessing the dirac point using transport studies in high - quality suspended graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the temperature dependence of graphene conductivity around the charge neutrality point provides information about how close the system can approach the dirac point although competition between long - range and short - range disorder as well as between diffusive and ballistic transport may considerably complicate the picture . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that acoustic phonon scattering contribution to the graphene resistivity is always relevant at the dirac point in contrast to higher density situations where the acoustic phonon contribution to the resistivity is strongly suppressed at the low temperature bloch - grneisen regime . </S>",
    "<S> we provide detailed numerical results for temperature and density dependent conductivity for suspended graphene . </S>"
