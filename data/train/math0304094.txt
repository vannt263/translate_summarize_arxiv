    "3-manifolds admitting uniform 1-cochain are generalizations of 3-manifolds fibering over @xmath29 and 3-manifolds slithering around @xmath29 .",
    "for example , if m is a 3-manifold fibering over @xmath29 , then let s say @xmath101 is the fibration .",
    "this induces a map on @xmath1 level @xmath102 .",

    "this implies that we have lots of bounded 1-cochains satisfying first 3 conditions of uniform 1-cochains",
    ". it might be possible to find some bounded 1-cochains satisfying the topological condition for any manifold of this kind .",
    "moreover , in [ th ] , thurston says that any hyperbolic manifold might be a slithering around @xmath29 and uniform 1- cochains are coarse generalizations of slitherings .",
    "because of these reasons , it was believed that they might be all - inclusive class for the hyperbolic part of the geometrization conjecture .",
    "we now know that there are hyperbolic manifolds which are not slitherings .",
    "this is because slitherings induce taut foliations , and there are many hyperbolic manifolds without taut foliations by [ rss ] . with this result",
    ", we saw that slitherings are not general enough , so the natural question arised `` what about uniform 1-cochains ? are they general enough for weak hyperbolization ? '' .",
    "but the answer was again `` no '' .",
    "last year , calegari and dunfield proved that there are also hyperbolic manifolds without uniform 1-cochain , by showing weeks manifold can not admit uniform 1-cochain , [ cd ] .",
    "now , we will use the following construction of calegari in [ ca ] induced by the given uniform 1-cochain on m. we will start with a nice triangulation with one vertex on m , @xmath65 .",
    "when we lift it to universal cover @xmath0 , and if we fix a vertex @xmath104 in @xmath115 , we can assign each vertex to an element of @xmath12 , @xmath70 , and we get a function from a discrete subset of @xmath0 to @xmath100 .",
    "we can make a controlled extension so that we get a function @xmath116 induced from the given uniform 1-cochain s. from now on , we fix the unambigiuous triangulation and controlled extension for m and s. let @xmath76 be the level sets of the function @xmath116 , i.e. @xmath75 for any @xmath117.let @xmath118 fixed .",

    "+ on the other hand , we know also by [ ca ] , there is a uniform constant ( independent of @xmath6 ) such that for any @xmath6 , @xmath123 .    then if we consider the action of @xmath12 on @xmath44 , by above we get @xmath124 .",
    "we conclude that for any @xmath125 , for any @xmath83 , @xmath126 . then @xmath127 is @xmath12-invariant subset of @xmath44 .",

    "m is a 3-manifold which is fibering over a circle with fiber a closed surface of genus 2 , s. the monodromy is a pseudo - anosov map , and so m is hyperbolic 3-manifold .",
    "we are going to make an analogy between this example and our situation .",

    "if we consider the lift of branched surfaces in universal cover @xmath1013 , we can see the the intersection train track lifts to infinite lines asymptotic to the end of lifts of solid tori , which are the special points ( defined above ) of corresponding circles at infinity , i.e. each infinite line limits to one positive special point ( special point in a positive circle @xmath51 at infinity ) and to one negative special point ( to see intuitively consider the quasi - isometric picture of @xmath0 as @xmath268 , and the infinite lines starts from bottom disk and ends in top disk ) so clearly we can orient each infinite line from a negative special point to positive special point .",

    "so , if you take two `` close '' leaves of lifts of @xmath1022 they will intersect in an interval not containing their special point of both circles and they will start to differ from their special point ( recall that every circle at infinity , @xmath1016 , has a special point which is the image of the endpoint of corresponding leave of @xmath14 ) see figure[12 ] . this is true for @xmath1023 as well .",
    "so , for the circles corresponding to the sides of ideal polygons in @xmath14 and corresponding circle at infinity of the leaves in @xmath1024 containing boundaries of solid tori gut regions , they have both negative and positive special points , and as in previous paragraph we oriented the core of solid torus as from negative special point to positive special point .",
    "see figure[13 ] + now , observe that in @xmath268 picture , the lift of branch locus , @xmath1025 ( which are lines as loops in branch locus are essential ) , in @xmath1022 branches towards positive side of @xmath268 , and similarly , @xmath1026 in @xmath1023 branches towards negative side of @xmath268 , see figure [ 14 ] .",

    "but in our situtation the tightness comes from being least area planes , which works in our situation as well . in other words , we know that the close circles at infinity , say @xmath1027 starts to diverge from each other from their special points and this will cause inside @xmath0 the leaves @xmath1028 of lamination @xmath933 will be close to each other for some time but they will start to diverge from each other after a lift of intersititial annulus . see figure [ 15 ] . on the other hand this intersititial annulus corresponds in branched surface literature a branch locus .",
    "now , we want to say that this branchings towards upside for @xmath954 and towards downside for for @xmath955 .",
    "this is true as at infinity diverging starts at positive side and inside we have tightness coming from the lamination being by least area planes .",

    "then our quasi - isometric picture of @xmath0 as @xmath268 shows that the orientation on each line of @xmath115 is coherent , and when we project it to the original manifold , we can easily get a vector field on our train track @xmath65 . + * extending x to the components of @xmath971 and @xmath972 : + by the first step we know that the components are annuli with cusped tongues",

    "i.e. since x is well - defined on @xmath65 , on the boundary of annulus of component , they must be parallel , and on boundary of cusped tongues they are consistent .",
    "so we can easily extend first on annulus such that each integral integral curve of x on annulus is closed as in boundary ( as x is parallel on two circles of the boundary ) , and then on cusped tongues .",
    "if we have a + annulus with cusped tongue then x on @xmath65 points away from the ideal vertex towards the annulus , and we can extend x to the cusped tongue with integral curves starting at ideal vertex , tangent to the sides contatining ideal vertex , and ending in the opposite side of ideal vertex , which is a segment of @xmath1029 .",
    "similarly , we can extend x to -annulus with cusped tongue . + * extending x to whole manifold by defining on the solid torus and pinched tetrahedron pieces .",

    "but , we defined x on @xmath65 by using the lift of @xmath969 to universal cover , and on each of these closed curves on @xmath1036 x is parallel to the orientation of the core curve of @xmath969 .",
    "so on each annuli the integral curves of x are closed and have same orientation with the core curve of @xmath969 .",
    "it is obvious that we can simply extend x to @xmath969 such that each integral curve is closed and oriented parallel to core curve ( i.e. the integral curves on solid torus @xmath969 will be the trivial one dimensional foliation . ) . + now , we have to check that x is continuous on m , i.e. there is no consistency problem with the definition of x on different components .",

    "finally , fenley showed that there are hyperbolic manifolds without any essential laminations , [ fe ] .",
