    "in mobile wireless networks , communications typically take place over time - varying channels . when this time - variation or fading is `` fast '' such that the channel state information ( csi ) is hardly obtainable at the transmitter , a classical approach for mitigating impairments of fading to transmission reliability is to apply _ diversity techniques _",
    ", such as coded diversity , antenna diversity , and path diversity . on the other hand , when the fading channel changes sufficiently `` slowly '' such that the transmitter is able to acquire the csi , a general approach to compensate for the fading is _ dynamic resource allocation _ , whereby transmit resources such as power , bit - rate , antenna - beam and bandwidth are dynamically allocated based upon the fading distribution .",
    "effective implementation of dynamic resource allocation usually requires joint optimization of both physical ( phy ) -layer transmission and media - access - control ( mac ) -layer rate scheduling in the classical communication protocol stack , and thus demands for a new _ cross - layer _ design methodology .",
    "one challenging issue to be addressed for dynamic resource allocation in tomorrow s wireless networks is how to meet with user s heterogeneous transmission quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements . among others ,",
    "the demand for wireless high - speed connectivity for both delay - tolerant `` packet '' data and delay - sensitive `` circuit '' data is expected to rise significantly in the next decade . therefore , study on both spectral and power efficient transmission schemes for support of _ heterogeneous delay - constrained data traffic _ becomes an important area for research . on the other hand , because tolerance for a larger transmission delay incurred to data traffic allows for more flexible transmit power and rate adaptation over time and thereby leads to a larger transmission throughput in the long term , there is in general a fundamental _ throughput - delay tradeoff _ associated with dynamic resource allocation over fading channels .",
    "characterization of such fundamental tradeoff is another important research problem because it reveals the ultimate gain achievable by dynamic resource allocation under realistic transmission delay requirements .",
    "this paper is aimed to provide concrete answers to the aforementioned problems by considering the fading broadcast channel ( bc ) that models the downlink transmission in a typical wireless cellular network .",
    "an information - theoretic approach is taken in this paper to address some fundamental limits of dynamic resource allocation for the fading bc under various transmission delay considerations .",
    "in particular , the fading multiple - input single - output ( miso ) bc is considered where multi - antennas are equipped at the transmitter of the base station ( bs ) , and single antenna at the receiver of each mobile user .",
    "because of multi - antennas at the transmitter , spatial multiplexing can be used at the bs to support simultaneous transmission to mobile users at the same frequency , named space - division - multiple - access ( sdma )",
    ". a slow - fading environment is assumed , and for simplicity , the block - fading ( bf ) channel model is adopted .",
    "it is further assumed that the bs has perfect user csi at its transmitter , and is thus able to perform a centralized dynamic resource allocation based upon multiuser channel conditions .",
    "this paper s main contributions are summarized as follows :    * this paper studies optimal dynamic resource allocation for the fading miso - bc when both no - delay - constrained ( ndc ) packet data and delay - constrained ( dc ) circuit data are required for transmission at the same time .",
    "a cross - layer optimization approach is taken for jointly optimizing capacity - achieving multi - antenna transmission at the phy - layer and fairness - ensured multiuser rate scheduling at the mac - layer .",
    "a convex optimization framework is formulated for minimizing the average transmit power at the bs subject to both ndc and dc user rate constraints . a _ two - layer lagrange - duality method _ is shown to be the key for solving this problem .",
    "based on this method , a novel online resource allocation algorithm that is amenable to efficient cross - layer implementation is derived , and its convergence behavior is validated .",
    "* this paper investigates the fundamental throughput - delay tradeoff for the fading miso - bc under optimal dynamic resource allocation . by taking the difference between the maximum sum - rate of users under ndc and dc transmission subject to the constraint that the rate portion allocated to each user",
    "needs to be regulated by the same prescribed _ rate - profile _ , the paper presents a novel characterization for the limiting loss in sum capacity due to the vanishing delay tolerance , termed the _ delay penalty _",
    ", for the fading miso - bc .",
    "thereby , the delay penalty provides the answer to the following interesting question : comparing no delay constraint versus zero - delay constraint for all users in the network , how much is the maximum percentage of throughput gain achievable for _ all _ users by optimal dynamic resource allocation ?",
    "the capacity region under ndc or dc transmission for a fading single - input single - output ( siso ) bc has been characterized in @xcite , @xcite , and for a fading siso multiple - access channel ( mac ) in @xcite , @xcite",
    ". a similar scenario like in this paper with mixed ndc and dc transmission has also been considered in @xcite for the single - user multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) fading channel , and in @xcite for the fading siso - bc .",
    "the comparison of achievable rates between ndc and dc transmission has been considered in @xcite for the fading mimo - bc . however , none of the above prior work has considered transmit optimization with mixed ndc and dc data traffic for the fading miso - bc , which is addressed in this paper . on the other hand ,",
    "throughput - delay and power - delay tradeoffs for communications over fading channels by exploiting the combined csi and data buffer occupancy at the transmitter have been intensively studied in the literature for both single - user and multiuser transmission ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast to prior work , this paper studies the throughput - delay tradeoff from a new perspective by characterizing the fundamental delay penalty in the network throughput owing to stringent ( zero ) transmission delay constraint imposed by all users .",
    "the concept of rate - profile , or its equivalent definitions for specifying some certain fairness in user rate allocation have also been considered for the siso multiuser channel in @xcite , @xcite , and for the mimo multiuser channel in @xcite , @xcite . however , to the author s best knowledge , application of rate - profile for characterizing the delay penalty in a multiuser fading channel is a novelty of this paper .",
    "there has been recently a great deal of study on the real - time resource allocation algorithm , named proportional fair scheduling ( pfs ) ( e.g. , @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) , which maximizes the network throughput by exploiting the multiuser channel variation and at the same time , maintains certain fairness among users in rate allocation .",
    "however , pfs is unable to guarantee any prescribed user rate demand . in this paper ,",
    "a novel online scheduling algorithm is proposed to ensure that all ndc and dc user rate demands are satisfied with the minimum transmit power consumption at the bs .",

    "this small fairness penalty can be explained by observing that the expected throughput for the fading miso - bc under both symmetric and asymmetric fading is quite insensitive to @xmath220 at a very large range of its values , indicating that by optimizing resource allocation , transmission with very heterogeneous rate requirements may incur only a negligible network throughput loss .",

    "<S> this paper is concerned with dynamic resource allocation in a cellular wireless network with slow fading for support of data traffic having heterogeneous transmission delay requirements . </S>",
    "<S> the multiple - input single - output ( miso ) fading broadcast channel ( bc ) is of interest where the base station ( bs ) employs multiple transmit antennas to realize simultaneous downlink transmission at the same frequency to multiple mobile users each having a single receive antenna . </S>",
    "<S> an information - theoretic approach is taken for characterizing capacity limits of the fading miso - bc under various transmission delay considerations . </S>",
    "<S> first , this paper studies transmit optimization at the bs when some users have delay - tolerant `` packet '' data and the others have delay - sensitive `` circuit '' data for transmission at the same time . based on the convex optimization framework , an online resource allocation algorithm is derived that is amenable to efficient cross - layer implementation of both physical ( phy ) -layer multi - antenna transmission and media - access - control ( mac ) -layer multiuser rate scheduling . secondly , this paper investigates the fundamental throughput - delay tradeoff for transmission over the fading miso - bc . by comparing the network throughput under completely relaxed versus strictly zero transmission delay constraint </S>",
    "<S> , this paper characterizes the limiting loss in sum capacity due to the vanishing delay tolerance , termed the _ delay penalty _ , under some prescribed user fairness for transmit rate allocation .    </S>",
