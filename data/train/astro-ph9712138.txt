    "gravitational lensing by a spiral galaxy occurs when the line - of - sight to a background quasar passes within a few kpc from the center of the galactic disk .",
    "since galactic disks are rich in neutral hydrogen ( hi ) , the quasar spectrum is likely to show a damped ly@xmath0  absorption trough at the lens redshift .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of blind searches for gravitational lensing with sub - arcsecond splitting can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude , by selecting a subset of all bright quasars which show a low - redshift ( @xmath2 ) damped ly@xmath0  absorption with a high hi column density , @xmath3 ( bartelmann & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , multiply imaged quasars could be identified spectroscopically through their multiple - trough absorption spectrum .",
    "the composite spectrum of a lensed quasar is a superposition of the spectra received from the different images which intersect the absorbing disk at different locations , probe different hi column densities , and hence acquire different widths in their damped ly@xmath0  troughs ( loeb 1997 ) .    the magnification bias due to lensing changes the statistics of damped ly@xmath0  absorbers ( dlas ) in quasar spectra by bringing into view quasars that would otherwise fall below the detection threshold ( bartelmann & loeb 1996 ; smette , claeskens , & surdej 1997 ) . for optical observations ,",
    "this effect is counteracted by dust extinction in the lensing galaxy ( malhotra , rhoads , & turner 1997 ; perna , loeb , & bartelmann 1997 ) .",
    "the combination of lensing and dust extinction results in a net distortion of the hi column density distribution of damped ly@xmath0  absorbers .",
    "since galactic disks are thin , their own surface mass density could exceed the critical value necessary for image splitting when they happen to be projected nearly edge - on .",
    "in such orientations , a pair of quasar images will straddle the symmetry axis of the disk rather than its center . when averaged over all possible disk orientations , the total lensing cross section of the disk@xmath1halo mass distribution should still be roughly the same as that of a halo with the same spherically - averaged mass profile ( wang & turner 1997 ; keeton & kochanek 1997 ) .",
    "however , because of the new predominant image configurations around edge - on disks , the effects of dust extinction and hi absorption are substantially different when lensing by the disk is included in the calculation .",
    "previous theoretical studies have either ignored the possibility of lensing by the disk itself ( bartelmann & loeb 1996 ; smette et al .",
    "1997 ) , or else ignored the effects of dust extinction or hi absorption on the lensing statistics ( maller , flores , & primack 1997 ; wang & turner 1997 ; keeton & kochanek 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , these discussions did not examine the implications of evolution in the spiral lens population on its overall lensing properties and statistics . in this paper",
    ", we include all of the above ingredients .",
    "our model evolves the number density of galaxies based on the press - schechter ( 1974 ) theory for dark matter halos , combined with simple evolutionary scaling laws for the disk properties inside these halos ( mo , mao , & white 1997 ) .    in  2",
    ", we describe our model for the mass and hi distributions in galactic disks , as well as our model for their dust content .",
    "we also summarize the adopted scaling laws for the evolution of the lens population with redshift . in  3 , we compute the lensing cross sections , imaging probabilities , and lensing statistics of our model spiral galaxies .",

    "@xmath19 is the position vector on the sky , and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the einstein radius of a singular isothermal sphere with a circular velocity @xmath9 .",
    "finally , @xmath22 is the projected axis ratio @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the inclination angle of the disk relative to the line - of - sight , with @xmath25 for an edge - on orientation .",

    "the third term adds the surrounding spherical halo necessary to maintain a flat rotation curve beyond the disk truncation radius .",

    "= 0.5    to completely define the model , we need to specify five parameters , namely the circular velocity @xmath9 , the two core radii @xmath35 , the disk radius @xmath31 , and the disk oblateness @xmath36 . for reference , we define @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . requiring a flat rotation curve , we must then use @xmath40 ( keeton & kochanek 1997 ) .",
    "finally , we choose @xmath41 .",
    "the rotation curve of this model is plotted in figure  [ fig:1 ] . as the figure shows , the rotation curve is flat to better than 5% beyond a radius of @xmath42 .",

    "the lens has two critical curves and caustics .",
    "the inner caustic , which is the image of the outer critical curve , has the familiar astroid shape with four cusps connected by folds .",
    "next , we address the effects of the gaseous component of the disk . to evaluate the level of dust extinction and hi absorption",
    ", we assume that the hi density , @xmath44 , follows a double - exponential profile , @xmath45 the three parameters that define this profile are the central neutral hydrogen density @xmath46 , the disk scale height @xmath47 , and the disk scale length @xmath48 . in order to keep the number of free parameters small in our model , we assume @xmath49 and @xmath50 , so that the hi scale height is given by the short axis of the oblate ellipsoid used to describe the lensing disk .",
    "we also identify the hi scale radius with the truncation radius for the lensing disk .",
    "the radial shape of the resulting radial hi profile is similar to that observed in local disk galaxies ( broeils & van woerden 1994 ) .",
    "we choose @xmath46 so that the face - on hi column density , @xmath51 , corresponds to the characteristic observed value ( broeils & van woerden 1994 ) , @xmath52 .",
    "hereafter , we use the notation @xmath53 . note that with these parameter choices , the solar neighborhood values for the hi column density ( @xmath54 ; kulkarni & heiles 1987 ) and hi scale height ( a few hundred pc ; knapp 1987 ; kuijken & gilmore 1989 ) of the milky way disk are reproduced reasonably well .",
    "we assume that the distribution of dust follows equation  ( [ eq:10 ] ) with a constant ratio of dust to hi gas .",
    "we adopt the scattering and absorption cross sections due to silicates and graphites derived by draine & lee ( 1984 ) .",
    "the total extinction cross section is the sum of the contributions from scattering and absorption , and the relative proportion of these components is chosen so as to fit best the observed galactic extinction law .",

    "observer s _ johnson @xmath59 band . in the rest frame of a lens at a redshift @xmath60 , this band",
    "is centered on the wavelength @xmath61 . for @xmath62 ,",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] yields @xmath63 .",
    "hence , for @xmath64 , @xmath65 magnitudes in the @xmath59 band . note that @xmath66 can easily exceed this value for edge - on disks , which are favored both geometrically and due to the magnification bias .",
    "the value of @xmath66 can be as large as @xmath67 , yielding @xmath68 for a lens at @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that the influence of dust on the imaging properties of spiral lenses can be severe .",
    "one would expect the dust - to - gas ratio of spiral disks to decline with increasing redshift , in accordance with their metallicity history .",
    "indeed , pei , fall , & bechtold ( 1991 ) infer that the dust - to - gas ratio in damped ly@xmath0  absorbers at redshifts @xmath69 is only a tenth of the milky - way value , although with considerable scatter ( fall & pei 1993 ) . if we parameterize the dust content to have a power - law dependence on redshift , @xmath70 , then a reduction by a factor of @xmath71 from the present time to @xmath72 implies @xmath73 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:12 ] ) is then changed to @xmath74 this dependence will be referred to as the `` dust evolution '' model in the discussion that follows .",
    "we assume that the lens population admits the schechter luminosity function at present with a number density per unit luminosity , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the scaled galaxy luminosity . for spiral galaxies , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( marzke et al .  1994 ) .",
    "the luminosity is related to the circular velocity through the tully - fisher ( 1977 ) relation , @xmath79 where @xmath0 varies between @xmath80 in the @xmath59 band and @xmath81 in the @xmath47 band ( see review by strauss & willick 1995 , and references therein ) .    equations ( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:21 ] ) imply that the einstein radius scales as @xmath82 .",
    "the computational effort required later on is substantially reduced if the scale radii of the disk@xmath1halo model change with @xmath83 in the same way as @xmath21 does . for convenience ,",
    "we therefore adopt the infrared value of @xmath84 and assume that the scale radii behave like implies constant surface brightness , the chosen scaling reflects freeman s law ( freeman 1970 ; holmberg 1975 ; peterson , strom , & strom 1979 ; van der kruit 1987 ; lauberts & valentijn 1989 ) .",
    "thus , we effectively ignore the scatter in freeman s law , and the influence of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies on the lensing cross section ( e.g. , bothun , impey , & mcgaugh 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "this omission is justified here because ( i ) the average circular velocities of lsb galaxies is somewhat lower than that of high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies , and the lensing cross section is a sensitive function of the circular velocity , and ( ii ) lsb galaxies are less compact than hsb galaxies and thus less efficient lenses .",
    "for the purposes of strong lensing , it therefore seems safe to neglect any contribution from lsb galaxies . ]",
    "it is then sufficient to calculate all cross sections for one reference luminosity only , and later scale the result to the desired @xmath83 by changing the einstein angle .",
    "if @xmath86 is some arbitrary cross section for the reference luminosity @xmath87 , then the average cross section for the entire population of spiral galaxies is @xmath88      the simplest assumption about the evolution of the spiral population is that they maintain a constant comoving number density , @xmath89 , and constant scale radii .",
    "this is the _ no - evolution _ model .",
    "alternatively , mo , mao , & white ( 1997 ) recently suggested a model for the evolution of spirals , based on four assumptions : ( i ) the disk mass is a fixed fraction @xmath90 of the halo mass ; ( ii ) the disk angular momentum is a fixed fraction @xmath91 of the halo s angular momentum ; ( iii ) the radial disk profile is exponential , and the disk is centrifugally supported ; and ( iv ) the disk is dynamically stable .",
    "these assumptions yield a set of simple and straightforward scaling relations , which we reproduce from mo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "we assume that the halo is a singular isothermal sphere with a radial density profile , @xmath92 taking the virial radius @xmath93 as the size of the halo , the halo mass is @xmath94 . here",
    "@xmath93 is the radius within which the average halo density is 200 times the _ critical _ density of the universe , @xmath95 and hence , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the hubble constant .",
    "similarly , @xmath98 the disk radius @xmath31 is related to the spin parameter of the halo , @xmath99 ( @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the total angular momentum and energy of the halo , respectively ) , by @xmath103 and the central surface mass density of the disk is @xmath104    in summary , scale radii scale like @xmath105 , and the surface mass density ( madau 1997 ) , while most of the lensing probability is contributed between @xmath106 . ]",
    "scales like @xmath107 .",
    "since the characteristic values of @xmath99 , @xmath108 , and @xmath90 are expected to depend very weakly on redshift , we use these simple proportionality relations with @xmath9 and @xmath109 in scaling the properties of the local spiral population to higher redshifts . since @xmath110 for @xmath111 , scale radii _ decrease _ with increasing @xmath112 , while the surface mass density _ increases _ with increasing @xmath112 .",
    "the evolution in the number density of spiral galaxies can be expressed in terms of the press - schechter distribution function for the mass @xmath113 , given by equation  ( [ eq:26 ] ) .",
    "we evolve the number density of galaxies given by equations  ( [ eq:20 ] ) , ( [ eq:21 ] ) , and ( [ eq:26 ] ) with the factor @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the press - schechter number density of halos with mass @xmath113 at redshift @xmath112 .",
    "because of the inherent uncertainty in modeling galaxy evolution , we present numerical results for three models , assuming : ( i ) no evolution ; ( ii ) evolution of scale radii only ; and ( iii ) evolution of galaxy number density and scale radii .",
    "it is well known that the present - day press - schechter mass function extends out to halo masses which are well beyond the galactic mass scale ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ) in all viable models of structure formation .",
    "this is due to the fact that the nonlinear mass scale at present ( which defines the exponential break in the press - schechter mass function ) corresponds to a much larger circular velocity than @xmath87 in the schechter function does , based on the tully - fisher relation [ cf .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) and  ( [ eq:21 ] ) ] .",
    "this implies that non - gravitational processes ( such as inefficient cooling , or expulsion of gas by supernovae ) prevented disk formation inside super - galactic halos at the present time . an evolutionary model for galaxies based solely on the press - schechter approach",
    "is therefore incomplete .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the discrepancy between the press - schechter mass function and the local luminosity function of galaxies is that massive galaxies with @xmath116 did not change their dynamical properties since the redshift of galaxy formation ( @xmath117 ) when the nonlinear mass scale was comparable to their mass .",
    "indeed , recent observations imply no significant evolution in the population of massive galaxies out to redshifts @xmath118 ( ellis 1997 , and references therein ; but see kauffmann , charlot , & white 1996 ) .",
    "however , the same observations reveal many more dwarf galaxies at high redshift than found locally .",
    "since the lensing probability is dominated by @xmath87 galaxies at @xmath119 , the no - evolution model might be more appropriate for calculations of lensing by disk galaxies .",
    "however , to bracket the other extreme of complete evolution we show results also for the press - schechter prediction .",
    "since we use the press - schechter mass function only to correct the overall normalization of the number density of spiral galaxies relative to its present - day value , our approach should be less affected by the incompleteness of the press - schechter treatment .    in all numerical calculations ,",
    "we use the cosmological parameters @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 . for the press - schechter mass function ,",
    "we use the standard cdm power spectrum ( bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) with the normalization @xmath123 .",
    "a cosmological model with these parameters reproduces the local abundance of rich galaxy clusters ( white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 ; eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ) , has the shape parameter @xmath124 preferred by analyses of galaxy clustering ( peacock & dodds 1994 ) , but has a somewhat higher normalization than derived from the cobe data ( e.g. ratra et al .",
    "it also agrees with the observed abundance of giant luminous arcs in galaxy clusters ( bartelmann et al .",
    "next , we proceed to calculate the magnification cross section of the disk@xmath1halo lenses . this calculation must be done numerically .",
    "first , we cover the source plane with a grid of source positions .",
    "far from the lens center , the resolution of this grid can be low , while close to the caustic curves where the highest magnifications arise , the resolution should be high .",
    "we therefore use an adaptive grid in the source plane whose resolution increases towards the caustic curves .",
    "then , for each source position , all image positions need to be found . for this purpose",
    ", we use the algorithm described by schneider , ehlers , & falco ( 1992 ) .",
    "briefly , it is based on covering the image plane with an uniform grid , which is then mapped back to the source plane .",
    "all grid cells on the image plane whose mapping on the source plane contains the source position , are taken to contain images of the source . in regions of strong lensing",
    ", the parity of the cell might be flipped when it is mapped into the source plane , i.e. corners of the cell might be interchanged .",
    "one should therefore start with triangular rather than rectangular cells in the image plane , because the image of a triangle remains a convex figure whose interior is well - defined .",
    "this can be easily achieved by splitting each rectangular cell along one of its diagonals . here",
    "again , we use an adaptive - grid approach in order to achieve high resolution at a reasonable computational cost . first , the image positions are searched on a coarse grid , constraining the regions on the lens plane where the images are located .",
    "then , each of these regions is covered with a fine grid on which the final image positions are localized . this way ,",
    "all the images corresponding to every segment on the source - plane grid are identified .",
    "the magnification of each image can then be computed from the total lensing potential ( [ eq:9 ] ) , @xmath125 evaluated at each of the image positions @xmath126 .",
    "when dust extinction is included , the effective magnification of an image at position @xmath126 is @xmath127\\ ; , \\label{eq:15a}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 is the hi column density at the position of the image .",
    "the net magnification is the sum of the moduli of the effective magnifications for all of its @xmath66 images , @xmath129    = 0.5    this approach yields maps of the source magnification in the source plane .",
    "the magnification cross sections can be extracted from these maps as the area in the source plane within which sources are magnified by a factor @xmath130 .",
    "the magnification cross section depends on the orientation of the disk relative to the line - of - sight . denoting the cross section for a magnification @xmath130 and a disk inclination angle @xmath24 by @xmath131",
    ", we obtain the inclination - averaged cross section through the integral , @xmath132 obviously , @xmath133 depends on the cosmological distances involved and on the other lens parameters .",
    "we suppress these dependences here for brevity .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows that the inclination - averaged magnification cross section of the disk@xmath1halo model is almost identical to that of a singular isothermal sphere with the same circular velocity . without imposing further conditions , like a minimum image separation or a maximum flux ratio between the images ,",
    "the lensing statistics of spiral lenses is well described by the simple spherical halo model .",
    "we will demonstrate below what happens when further constraints are imposed on the image properties .    in the limit of small magnifications ( @xmath134 )",
    ", the cross section for the disk@xmath1halo model becomes numerically incomplete ; this follows from the fact that the cross - section increases rapidly as @xmath134 , while the simulation is spatially bounded .",
    "this limit is irrelevant for our purposes because we always impose further imaging constraints . in particular , when we require the image separation and flux ratio to be bounded to reasonable limits , the cross section is confined to the multiple - imaging region , which is entirely contained within our simulated section of the source plane .",
    "given the inclination - averaged cross sections , the probability for a ( point ) source at redshift @xmath135 to be imaged with magnification @xmath130 is obtained by the line - of - sight integral over the density of lenses times their lensing cross section , @xmath133 . for the model without number - density evolution , this integral yields @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the proper - distance interval corresponding to the redshift interval @xmath138 .",

    "the solid and long - dashed curves in figure  [ fig:5 ] are for the disk@xmath1halo model and for the singular isothermal sphere , respectively . evidently , the disk@xmath1halo model is less efficient at producing multiple images with the specified properties than the singular isothermal sphere is , despite the fact that the total magnification cross sections of the two models are close to each other ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the images produced by the spiral lens model are typically closer to each other than those of the singular isothermal sphere , and are occasionally below the @xmath160 threshold .",

    "models without dust cause @xmath181 to be overestimated by factors of up to a few in samples of bright quasars .",
    "the magnification bias brings into view quasars that were otherwise too faint to be detected .",
    "the lensed quasar images occur close to the lens center , where the hi column density is higher than average .",

    "now those quasars whose images are close to the disk are obscured , and the number of quasar spectra with high hi column density is lower . for evolving dust and @xmath173 , only about 20%30% of the neutral hydrogen is detected .",
    "we investigated the lensing effects of spiral galaxies , modelled as maximal truncated mestel disks embedded in spherical halos .",
    "this model makes the disk as massive as possible .",
    "our results therefore represent the opposite extreme to the simple isothermal sphere models .",
    "intermediate models with less massive disks , would shift these results towards those obtained from the spherical model .",
    "although a disk@xmath1halo configuration yields an inclination - averaged lensing cross section similar to that of the spherically symmetric mass distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) , its typical image separations are considerably smaller ( fig .  [ fig:7 ] ) . a substantial contribution to",
    "this cross section comes from lensing by nearly edge - on configurations of the disk , in which a pair of images straddles the disk . because the images are often close to the disk , they suffer strong extinction by dust .",
    "the extinction lowers the detection efficiency of spiral lenses in the optical band by an order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , disk lenses are often characterized by small image separation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) and large differential extinction ( fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] ) . as a result , the selection effects imposed by the finite angular resolution and dynamic range of observations set limits on the minimum image separation and their maximum flux ratio , and lower substantially the probability for observing spiral lenses ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ) .",
    "the spiral - lens system b  0218@xmath1357 shows compelling evidence for strong extinction .",
    "odea et al . (",

    "more generally , malhotra , rhoads , & turner ( 1997 ) argue for a systematic reddening of lensed quasars relative to the rest of the quasar population .    the optical depth to gravitational lensing of quasars",
    "was shown to be a very effective tool for setting constraints on the cosmological constant ( kochanek 1996 , and references therein ) . in singular isothermal models , @xmath191 of the lensing probability",
    "is contributed by elliptical galaxies . however , if a significant fraction of the present - day ellipticals were in the form of spiral building blocks at @xmath192 ( as argued by kauffmann , charlot , & white 1996 ) , then the depletion of spiral lenses due to dust extinction and selection effects could weaken the current lensing constraints on the cosmological constant .",
    "this issue was addressed by mao & kochanek ( 1994 ) and rix et al .",
    "they found that estimates of the cosmological constant from the statistics of strong lensing can be significantly changed only when the elliptical galaxies seen today evolved dramatically below a redshift @xmath118 .    in this context , and in view of ongoing lensing surveys ,",
    "it is instructive to examine which fraction of the total lensing optical depth is contributed by spirals rather than by ellipticals . to calculate this",
    ", we assume that the total galaxy population today is composed of 25% ellipticals and 75% spirals .",
    "we model spirals as described above , and ellipticals as singular isothermal spheres with a characteristic velocity dispersion of @xmath193 , following the schechter luminosity function ( [ eq:20 ] ) and the faber - jackson ( 1976 ) relation . for simplicity",
    ", we use the same schechter - function parameters as for the spirals .",
    "we consider two scenarios , one in which the number density of ellipticals stays constant with redshift , and another in which ellipticals are assembled by merging of spirals . in the latter scenario ,",
    "we assume that the number density of ellipticals changes with redshift as a power - law , @xmath194 , with @xmath195 , chosen such that @xmath196 of the ellipticals are in the form of spiral bulding blocks at @xmath118 ( kauffmann et al .",
    "we further assume that mergers conserve mass . in both scenarios",
    ", we can then compute the lensing optical depths for both spirals and ellipticals @xmath197 from equation  ( [ eq:17 ] ) and the corresponding imaging probability @xmath198 from equation  ( [ eq:19 ] ) ( under the constraints that the images be separated by @xmath158 and have a flux ratio @xmath159 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:12 ] shows the fraction of the total lensing probability contributed by spirals , namely @xmath199 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows results for ellipticals with constant comoving number density , while panel ( b ) examines the scenario in which ellipticals merge out of spirals .",
    "the three curves per panel are for spirals without dust , with non - evolving dust , and with evolving dust ( solid , dotted , and dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "the no - dust results are valid for radio - selected lenses",
    ". the solid line in panel ( a ) reproduces the familiar result that dust - free spirals contribute at most @xmath200 of the multiple - imaging probability , even for the small image - separation cutoff of @xmath201 ; this fraction is lower for higher @xmath166 . in the presence of dust ,",
    "the fraction contributed by spirals is considerably smaller . in the merger scenario ,",
    "the spiral lens fraction rises to @xmath202 without dust , and @xmath203 with evolving dust , for quasars with @xmath204 .",
    "thus , up to a half of the lenses found in radio surveys ( which are sensitive to small image separations ) might be imaged by spirals .",
    "= 0.7    figure  [ fig:9 ] implies that radio surveys should be about a factor of 510 more efficient at detecting spiral lenses than optical surveys .",
    "the recent class and jvas radio surveys indeed provide preliminary hints of a more substantial population of spiral lenses than found in optical surveys ( cf .",
    "table  1 in browne et al .",
    "1997 ; and jackson , nair , & browne 1997 ; but see fassnacht & cohen 1997 ) .",
    "to date , the combined class and jvas samples encompass more than @xmath205 flat - spectrum radio sources , 11 of which have been identified as lens systems . a substantial fraction of those has been classified as being lensed by spirals or s0 galaxies ( cf .",
    "myers 1997 ; williams & schechter 1997 ) .",
    "because of their small image separation and simple geometry , lenses containing edge - on disks might offer a unique opportunity for estimating the masses of galactic disks at high redshifts , and also for constraining the hubble constant based on the time - delay between the flux variations in their images .",
    "indeed , the time delay in b  0218 has been measured to @xmath206 days , translating to a hubble constant of @xmath207 ( corbett et al .",
    "1996 ) , and b  1608@xmath1656 offers another promising lens system for this purpose ( myers et al .",
    "1995 ; fassnacht et al . 1996 ) .",
    "finally , we find that dust dominates over the magnification bias due to lensing in modifying the statistics of damped ly@xmath0  absorption by spirals ( fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] ) .",
    "if most of the damped absorption systems are spirals , the inferred value of the cosmological density parameter in hi at @xmath2 could be underestimated by a factor of a few .",
    "the above results were obtained under the assumption that all spirals possess the same dust - to - gas ratio throughout their disks at any given redshift .",
    "if the scatter in the dust content of different galaxies is large or if the dust distribution is patchy , then the quantitative impact of dust on the lensing statistics would be altered .",
    "in addition , if spiral disks at @xmath2 are less massive than our _ maximal disk _ model assumes , then the lensing cross section of the disk and its related extinction signature would be reduced .",
