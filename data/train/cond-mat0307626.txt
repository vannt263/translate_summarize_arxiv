    "a key factor determining the equilibrium morphology of a vicinal crystal surface is the interaction between the steps on that surface . in many cases , the elastic and electronic contributions to the step - step interaction",

    ", we confine ourselves in this paper to interactions of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : invsquareinteraction ] ) . with this restriction ,",
    "many of the quantities discussed in this paper depend only on a single dimensionless parameter , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the step stiffness , @xmath10 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath11 is the absolute temperature .",
    "one of the easiest methods@xcite for experimentally determining the interaction between steps on a vicinal crystal surface is through the observation of the terrace width distribution ( twd ) .",
    "typically , this has been done by fitting the twd to a gaussian , which is a good approximation and justified by the gruber - mullins approximation@xcite ( analogous to the einstein model@xcite of solids ) if the steps strongly repel each other .",
    "the step - step interaction is then extracted from the variance of the gaussian .",
    "unfortunately , however , the gaussian approximation is only good for strongly interacting steps , and there are conflicting theories regarding the relationship between the step - step interaction and the variance .    over the past",
    "decade@xcite it has become apparent that the so - called generalized wigner distribution ( gwd ) provides a much better approximation to the twd .",
    "the gwd exhibits the positive skew observed in twds from experiments and simulations , and it is a good fit quantitatively to twds produced from monte carlo simulations of the terrace - step - kink ( tsk ) model .",
    "more significantly , the gwd can be justified on the basis of plausible approximations@xcite , the most important of which is that the interaction and fluctuations of _ two _ adjacent steps are explicitly considered ; the gruber - mullins approximation only explicitly considers _",
    "one _ step .",
    "the two steps are kept close to each other by a harmonic well , which approximates the interactions with all other steps .",
    "this model is refered to as the pairwise einstein model ( pem ) . both the gruber - mullins and pairwise einstein models start by interpreting the steps as world - lines of spinless fermions , with the @xmath12-direcion ( the average direction of the steps ) corresponding to time .",
    "this paper considers a different statistical measure of the vicinal surface : the step position distribution ( spd ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec - predictions ] , we show that the pairwise einstein model predicts a gaussian - like distribution for the _ position _ of steps . in sec .",

    "[ sec - conclusions ] we summarize and draw our conclusions .",
    "as was shown in ref .  , the generalized wigner distribution can be derived from a phenomenological treatment in which only two steps are treated explicitly , the rest contributing a `` confinement potential '' related to the two - dimensional pressure and compressibility of the system of steps .",
    "we use the usual trick of mapping steps onto the worldlines of one - dimensional spinless fermions , which in this case have the hamiltonian@xcite @xmath13 in this dimensionless formulation , we require that @xmath14 this fixes the value of @xmath15 to @xmath16 where @xmath17 ^ 2 \\ , , \\ ] ] and @xmath18 after a change of variables@xcite to @xmath19 this hamiltonian becomes separable@xcite , @xmath20 and it has the remarkable property that all of the eigenstates are known .",
    "the only eigenstate of interest to us at present , however , is the ground state , which can be written@xcite @xmath21           \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times                                   \\left [ \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi b_\\varrho } }                                    \\exp \\left (                                         -4 b_\\varrho x_{\\rm cm}^2                                         \\right)\\right ] \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22}\\ ] ] is a constant of normalization .",

    "the coefficient of skewness is given asymptotically by @xmath35 note that the coefficient of skewness would have the opposite sign if it had been defined as @xmath36 .",
    "the kurtosis , which is the same regardless of which step is considered , is given asymptotically by @xmath37    the fact that the kurtosis is not exactly zero is not in itself surprising ; even within the gruber - mullins approximation , the gaussian distribution is only obtained in the limit of large @xmath38 .",
    "the symmetry of our original problem of an infinite number of steps on an infinite vicinal surface , on the other hand , means that the coefficient of skewness , by contrast , _ must _ be zero for the original problem .",
    "any given step on the surface can be considered `` step  1 '' , with its downhill neighbor as `` step  2 '' , or it can be considered `` step  2 '' , with its uphill neighbor as `` step  1 '' ; calling it one or the other breaks the symmetry and permits a nonzero coefficient of skewness .",

    "( [ eq : q ] ) , we have performed monte carlo simulations of the terrace - step - kink ( tsk ) model and measured the spd for several values of @xmath38 .",
    "the geometry of the simulated systems was as follows .",
    "all simulations were for systems of 30 steps ; the length of each of which was @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the lattice constant ) in the average direction of the steps ( the @xmath12-direction in `` maryland notation '' ) .",
    "the mean step separation was @xmath41 , and periodic boundary conditions were applied .    the dynamic used was a local metropolis update .",
    "the temperature was set at @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the kink energy ; in a previous study , this was approximately the temperature at which twds from the restricted tsk model showed the best agreement with the generalized wigner distribution .",
    "each simulation was equilibrated for at least 500  000 monte carlo steps per site ( mcss ) at the temperature and value of @xmath38 at which measurements were taken ; the initial configurations , however , were not typically straight steps , but steps that had been equilibrated at some other value of @xmath38 .",
    "data were taken from 1  000 `` snapshots , '' taken at intervals of 1  000 mcss .",
    "although the terrace width is always an integer multiple of @xmath40 in the tsk model , the average step position can be any rational number , depending only on the size of the simulation . since the step position @xmath44 is always an integer , the histogram of positions for any given step need not be symmetric .    in order to show concretely what this means , consider a situation in which a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath45 and variance @xmath46 is binned into a histogram as follows .",
