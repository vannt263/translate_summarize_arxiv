    "the formation and evolution of galaxies is a complex process , which may involve starbursts , infall , interactions ( e.g. , dressler et al.1994a , b ; lilly et al .",
    "1995 ; moore et al .",
    "the tully - fisher ( 1977 ) and the fundamental plane ( fp ) ( dressler et al .  1987a ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) relations are valuable sources of information for disk and elliptical galaxies , respectively . in particular ,",
    "the fp and its projection on the average surface  brightness ( @xmath9 ) effective  radius ( @xmath10 ) plane ( kormendy relation , kormendy 1985 ) have been used as powerful tools for estimating distances of galaxy clusters ( dressler et al .",
    "1987b , lynden - bell et al .  1988 ,",
    "faber et al .  1989 ) and , more recently , for investigating the evolution of elliptical galaxies ( bender et al .",
    "1992 , pahre and djorgovski  1996 , fasano et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "if the luminosity profiles and the dynamical structures of the galaxies are similar , then the very existence of the fp implies a virial equilibrium condition .",
    "moreover , the slope of the fp ( which slightly differs from that expected in the case of ` pure ' virial equilibrium ) could imply that the @xmath14 ratio depends on the mass of the galaxy ( djorgovski and santiago 1993 ) .",
    "recent advances in the sensitivity and resolution of the observations both in imaging and spectroscopy with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and from the ground have greatly enlarged the horizon of morphological and dynamical studies , thus allowing the investigation of the fp in clusters with redshift up to @xmath15 ( kelson et al .",
    ". the backward evolution of the surface brightness derived from the zero point of the fp in these clusters seems consistent with a passive evolution of galaxies ( bender et al .",
    "1997 ) . on the other hand , it is still matter of debate whether the slope of the fp ( i.e. the function @xmath16 ) varies with the redshift ( van  dokkum and franx  1996 , kelson et al .",
    "1997 , jrgensen and hjorth  1997 ) .",
    "the difficulty of obtaining reliable velocity dispersion estimates represents the key obstacle in trying to improve the results of fp studies , as well as to extend them to higher redshifts . in spite of its larger scatter , the kormendy relation @xmath17 allows to overcome this limitation ( kjrgaard et al .",
    "1993 , pahre et al .",
    "1996 , fasano et al .",
    "1997 ) . actually , from deep hst imaging of fields around powerful radio - sources and radio - loud quasars , dickinson ( 1995 , 1997a ) was able to obtain the kormendy relation of clusters up to @xmath18 .    the hubble deep field ( williams et al .",
    "1996 , see also ellis 1997 ; hereafter hdf ) is perhaps the most impressive example of the recent advances in optical imaging .",
    "the very long exposure time , the observational procedures and the data handling techniques of hdf have provided exceptional spatial resolution and depth . the unprecedented low surface brightness level reached by the hdf data turns out to be particularly suited for performing detailed surface photometry of objects whose brightness slowly decreases towards the outer regions , as in the case of elliptical galaxies .    we have undertaken a long  term project aimed at producing detailed surface photometry in the four available bands of a sample of early  type galaxies in the hdf",
    ". the main scientific goal of this project is to put strong observational constraints to the theories modeling the evolution of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. tantalo et al .",
    "1996 , kauffmann and charlot 1997 ) .",
    "the detailed surface photometry of our galaxy sample in the @xmath0 band is presented elsewhere ( fasano and filippi 1998 ; hereafter ff98 ) . in the present paper",
    "we discuss the improvements that the morphological information , together with the photometry in different optical and infrared bands , can produce in understanding the processes of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in section 2 we report on the database we use to perform the present analysis , referring to ff98 as far as the original sample selection and the detailed surface photometry are concerned . in the same section",
    "we describe of the auxiliary data ( taken from both network and recent literature ) useful for the present analysis . in section 3 the technique we used to extract from the luminosity profiles the relevant photometric parameters",
    "is discussed . in section 4",
    "we analyze the relation @xmath17 ( kormendy relation ; hereafter @xmath19 ) for early  type galaxies in the @xmath20 . in the same section",
    "we discuss the @xmath21evolutionary corrections expected from the current models on the basis of the available optical and infrared photometry , and derive photometric redshifts for the galaxies without spectroscopic information .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in section 5 . unless otherwise noted we assume @xmath22 km / s / mpc and @xmath23 throughout .",
    "the present sample of _ early  type _ galaxies has been extracted from the second release of the @xmath24 frames , in the @xmath0 band .",
    "the selection is based on the photometry carried out by couch ( 1996 ) with the automated sextractor algorithm ( bertin and arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "a preliminary list of candidates was defined including all the hdf objects satisfying the following criteria : _ a ) _ kron _ ab _ magnitude in the @xmath0 band @xmath25 26.3 ; _ b ) _ number of pixels above the threshold limit of @xmath26 of the background noise @xmath27 200 ; _ c ) _ star / galaxy classifier @xmath28 0.6 ( @xmath29=1 means star ) .",
    "the combination of the first two limits ensures a sufficient signal to noise ratio and an adequate number of independent isophotes to carry out a reliable morphological analysis .",
    "each of the 401 objects matching the above limits was examined with the _ imexam  iraf _ tool to produce a first screening against late - type objects .",
    "the preliminary morphological classification was also compared with the ones by van den bergh et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and statler ( 1996 ) , finding a general good agreement .",
    "detailed surface photometry ( luminosity and geometrical profiles ) was carried out on the resulting list of 162 _ early  type _ candidates . from the analysis of the luminosity and geometrical profiles , 34 objects of the sample",
    "have been recognized to be _disk  dominated_ objects ( likely @xmath30 galaxies ) , whereas 28 more objects showed peculiar or unclassifiable profiles .",
    "these galaxies were excluded from the final sample of 99 _bona fide_ early  type galaxies .",
    "further details about the sample selection and surface photometry are given in ff98 .",
    "we recall here that , on the basis of their luminosity profiles , our @xmath20 _ early  type _ galaxies were divided in three different classes : ( ff98 ; see also fasano et al .",
    "1996 ) : _ 1 ) _ the _normal_ class ( 54 galaxies ) , for which the de  vaucouleurs law is well sampled up to the innermost isophote that is not significantly affected by the @xmath31 ; _ 2 ) _ the _flat_ class ( 36 galaxies ) , characterized by an inward flattening of the luminosity profiles ( with respect to the de  vaucouleurs law ) which can not be ascribed to the effect of the @xmath31 ; _ 3 ) _ the _merger_ class ( 9 galaxies ) , in which isophotal contours show the existence of complex inner structures ( two or more nuclei ) embedded inside common envelopes , roughly obeying the @xmath32 law .",
    "it is worth to point out that the morphological classification of galaxies in our sample is necessarily much more a qualitative than a quantitative one . in most cases",
    "the spatial resolution is ` critical ' and many faint galaxies appear heavily disturbed by the presence of close ( often multiple ) companions or peculiar structures .",
    "sometimes the only unquestionable characteristic of the object is the presence of a strong spheroidal component .",
    "for this reason , although the main requirement for final inclusion in our sample is the prominence of the @xmath32 component in the luminosity profile , we consider more appropriate referring to our galaxies as ` _ early - type _ ' .",
    "an additional problem concerning the morphological classification comes from the fact that the light distribution of very high redshift galaxies in the @xmath0 band ( rest - frame mid and far - iv wavelengths ) may reflect the comparatively chaotic distribution of star - formation rather than the structural morphology of galaxies . in section 5 this point will be addressed in more detail .    in the following",
    "we will restrict our analysis to the galaxies for which a spectroscopic redshift is available ( 23 ) , or a reliable redshift estimate is possible ( 25 ) , on the basis of multi  band ( optical _ and _ infrared ) photometry ( see section 4.2 ) .    in table 1",
    "we report the relevant data for this sub  sample : in column ( 1 ) the identification given by williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) the coordinates ; in column ( 4 ) the luminosity profile class ; in columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) the effective radius and surface brightness derived from the @xmath0 photometry .    in column",
    "( 9 ) the total @xmath0 magnitude , estimated with the detailed surface photometry of ff98 , is reported . in order to obtain the total magnitudes in the other three wfpc2 bands we have followed and indirect procedure .",
    "we have obtained sextractor magnitudes in all four bands using for each galaxy of the sample an optimized aperture derived from the @xmath0 image .",
    "then the sextractor magnitudes have been scaled by the offset between the total and the sextractor @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "this procedure has been adopted because for galaxies with extended profiles like ellipticals the total magnitude derived from the detailed surface photometry ( @xmath0 band ) is more reliable than the ones provided by any automated photometry . as an example ,",
    "[ fig : aiapsex ] shows the biases of the sextractor total magnitudes as a function of the galaxy size and surface brightness .",
    "the color photometry scheme we used is a good approximation if the galaxies do not have significant color gradients .",
    "this is true for _normal_ , nearby ellipticals , where the color gradients turn out to be usually lower than few tenths of magnitude ( franx and illingworth  1990 , peletier et al .",
    "1990 ) . in section 5",
    "we will see that also star  forming galaxies at intermediate redshift seem not to show significant color gradients . in any case , the errors expected as due to possible color gradients should be quite lower than the systematic uncertainties associated with automated magnitude estimates ( see fig.[fig : aiapsex ] ) .",
    "the total @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 magnitudes are reported in table 1 ( columns 7 , 8 and 10 , respectively ) .",
    "dickinson ( 1997b ) has provided deep , near infrared ( @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6 ) images of the @xmath20 taken with the @xmath33 camera at the mayall 4m telescope ( total exposure time of @xmath3445 hours ) .",
    "the total @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 magnitudes , again estimated with the sextractor algorithm , are reported in columns ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , respectively .",
    "column ( 14 ) is a flag defining the reliability of the infrared photometry .",
    "the redshifts of the galaxies are reported in column ( 15 ) .",
    "the photometric redshifts are in parentheses , and their uncertainties are given in column ( 16 ) .",
    "many galaxies in the present sample show a luminosity profile close to the instrumental psf . a restoration procedure is needed to extract useful morphological information .",
    "fasano et al.(1997 ) have shown that the _multi ",
    "gaussian expansion_ deconvolution technique ( _ emgdec _ , bendinelli 1991 ) gives good results in recovering the _true_ equivalent half - light radius @xmath10 and the corresponding average surface brightness @xmath9 from ground  based observations of elliptical galaxies in distant clusters . in particular , by using numerical simulations of synthetic elliptical galaxies , fasano et al.(1997 ) concluded that this deconvolution technique is efficient down to @xmath35 .",
    "the input data of the _ emgdec _ algorithm are the _equivalent_ luminosity profiles of the galaxy and of the @xmath31 , both represented in analytical form by means of suitable series of gaussians .    in the case of the present sample of @xmath20 galaxies , there are particular problems inherent to the data : _ ( a ) _ the @xmath31 profile is known not to be a decreasing monotonic function of radius .",
    "this implies that , in order to give a good representation of the psf , we should use a multi ",
    "gaussian expansion with free gaussian centers ( i.e. increased number of parameters ) ; _ ( b ) _ the @xmath31 profile exhibits quite extended wings which can in principle affect the total magnitude estimate if some analytic law is assumed to extrapolate the luminosity profiles ; _ ( c ) _ the presence of strong diffraction spikes in the @xmath31 can alter the shape of the isophotes , thus affecting the profiles especially in case of very bright galactic nuclei ; _ ( d ) _ the shape of the @xmath31 is well known to depend on the position inside the different @xmath36 frames .    concerning the point _",
    "( a ) _ , we checked both the _free - center_ and the _fixed - center_ multi ",
    "gaussian representation of the @xmath31 for a few typical cases .",
    "we found negligible differences in the deconvolved profiles and no differences in the effective radii between the two procedures . since the _free - center_ approach turns out to be much more time consuming with respect to the other one",
    ", we decided to ignore the characteristic oscillations of the @xmath31 profile in the multi ",
    "gaussian representation of the @xmath31 .",
    "the points _ ( c ) _ and _ ( d ) _ can be important when dealing with two  dimensional problems ( modeling and removal of point sources , lucy deconvolution , etc . ) .",
    "they can be neglected in our case , since the _ emgdec _ deconvolution operates on _equivalent_ ( radially averaged ) profiles .",
    "the point _",
    "( b ) _ is a delicate one , since it becomes more and more important as the galaxy size becomes comparable with the @xmath31 size . in this case",
    "it is necessary to impose that the multi ",
    "gaussian extrapolation of the outer galaxy profile does not fall below the @xmath31 profile itself . to this end",
    "we forced the extrapolation of the luminosity profiles of very small galaxies to converge smoothly towards the @xmath31 profile at large radii .",
    "luminosity profiles with an effective radius larger than three times the @xmath37 were extrapolated simply with a de  vaucouleurs law ( see ff98 ) .",
    "although preserving the total luminosity , the _ emgdec _ deconvolution is not univocal . actually , it depends on the multi ",
    "gaussian representation ( and extrapolation ) of the profiles , as well as on the so called _regularization_ technique ( see bendinelli 1991 for details ) .",
    "however , we found that changing these assumptions within wide ranges produces only marginal changes in the resulting deconvolved profiles and no significant changes at all in the corresponding half  light ( _ effective _ ) radii @xmath10 .",
    "the deconvolution turns out to be quite robust as far as the estimation of the equivalent effective radius @xmath10 is concerned .",
    "it is also worth stressing that the morphological classification ( and then the inclusion in the sample ) is decided before deconvolution . in other words ,",
    "the profile shape uncertainties associated with the _ emgdec _ technique do not affect the sample selection .",
    "[ fig : decex ] shows the application of this algorithm in four extreme cases .",
    "the comparison between the effective radii before and after deconvolution is illustrated in figure [ fig : decef ] .    in order to explore",
    "how reliable is the _ emgdec _ technique in our particular case , we produced a set of simulations specifically designed to reproduce the observational conditions of our sample of @xmath20 ellipticals ( @xmath37/pixel  size ratio , noise , range of @xmath10/@xmath37 ratios , range of magnitudes ) .",
    "several frames of synthetic elliptical galaxies , with different magnitudes and effective radii , were first convolved with the theoretical @xmath31 of the @xmath38 , and then were processed using our techniques for the extraction and deconvolution of luminosity profiles .",
    "figure [ fig : decef ] illustrates the results of this analysis . in particular , the bias in the @xmath10 measured in the simulations ( solid line ) matches the distribution of the observed @xmath20 ellipticals ( open circles ) .",
    "figure [ fig : decef ] confirms the previous finding by fasano et al.(1997 ) that the ` _ true _ ' effective radius can be confidently recovered down to @xmath39 ( see filled circles ) .    in order to obtain reliable error estimates for @xmath10",
    ", we have also to take into account the uncertainties in the total @xmath0 magnitudes . adopting the errors provided in this band by the automated sextractor photometry ( @xmath40 on average ; @xmath41 in the worst cases ) , as a conservative estimate for our detailed surface photometry",
    ", we can estimate the log  error in @xmath10 to be @xmath42 on average ( @xmath43 in the worst cases ) .",
    "the radius @xmath10 and the average _ effective _ surface brightness @xmath9 , listed in columns 5 and 6 of table 1 , are values estimated in the @xmath0 band after deconvolution .",
    "the relation between the effective radius @xmath10 and the corresponding average surface brightness @xmath9 ( kormendy 1985 ) is just a projection of the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ) .",
    "the zero point of @xmath9 in the kormendy relation ( hereafter @xmath19 ) has been recently used in galaxy clusters at different redshifts , as a standard candle to perform the classical tolman test for the expansion of the universe and for testing the evolutionary models of galaxies ( pahre et al .",
    "1996 , fasano et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "in the deep fields ( in particular in the @xmath20 ) we are dealing with a completely different situation : most of the galaxies are not in clusters and have very different redshifts .",
    "still , putting the galaxies in the ( @xmath9@xmath10 ) plane is an interesting exercise , as we will show in the following .",
    "figure [ fig : kor1 ] shows the @xmath9@xmath10 plane for the 23 @xmath20 early  type galaxies in our sample with spectroscopic redshift .",
    "the effective radii ( in kpcs ) are computed from the deconvolved luminosity profiles .",

    "a lack of spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath46 is apparent .",
    "we also note the tendency of high redshift galaxies ( @xmath47 ) to be intrinsically smaller with respect to galaxies with @xmath48 . by applying only the @xmath45 cosmological dimming correction",
    "( lower  left panel in figure [ fig : kor1 ] ) we obtained two distinct sequences for high redshift and low redshift galaxies in the @xmath9 - @xmath10 plane . both sequences are roughly parallel to the local @xmath19 , with a small negative shift in the zero point at low - redshift and a large positive shift at high redshift . in the following section",
    "we investigate how such shifts can be explained in terms of evolutionary effects .      in order to derive more realistic corrections for the observed surface brightness of the @xmath20 ellipticals ,",
    "we need to model their evolution .",

    "the @xmath49 models belong to the ` _ closed - box _ ' class .",
    "the history of star formation consists of an initial period of activity followed by quiescence after the onset of the galactic winds , whose duration depends on the galactic mass , being longer in the high mass galaxies and shorter in the low - mass ones . in the following we will refer to a _ passive _ model , characterized by an early onset of the galactic winds , and an _ active _ model , in which star formation continues until late epochs .",

    "two different sequences of galaxy colors are apparent in the @xmath57 ( and in minor degree in the @xmath58 ) . to fully reproduce them , different models or at least different choices of the parameters ( e.g. @xmath59 ) characterizing a given model would be required .",
    "we have not attempted to do it in this simplified approach , since we were interested only in the k+e corrections to be applied to the @xmath0 band .",

    "the _ passive _ closed  box model and the models governed by the infall are clearly not able to reproduce the color@xmath60 diagrams with a unique redshift of formation .    in the present analysis we have not included the effects of dust which , due to the shape of the extinction law , are potentially more and more important at increasing redshifts . in general to reproduce the observed colors in presence of dust a smaller redshift of formation is required . on the other hand ,",
    "a larger unabsorbed luminosity has to be assumed and the two effects tend , at least qualitatively , to compensate in the estimation of the @xmath11 correction .",

    "different kinds of biases are expected to affect the two samples ( e.g. objects with spectroscopic identifications tend to have on average brighter magnitudes and higher central surface brightnesses ) .",
    "figure [ fig : kor3 ] indicates that , if we apply to the observed @xmath9 the k+e - correction deduced from the galaxy models that properly reproduce the observed colors , the early  type galaxies in the @xmath20 follow the local kormendy relation at any redshift .",
    "the kormendy relation is well known to be a projection of the fundamental plane ( fp ) which roughly represents the virial equilibrium condition of galaxies , except for a small tilt interpreted in terms of an @xmath63 relation ( faber et al .",

    "[ fig : kor3 ] also shows that , high redshift galaxies are confined in the high surface brightness , small effective radius region of the @xmath19 plane .",
    "is this tendency due to the fact that large ellipticals have a faint surface brightness ( according to the kormendy relation itself ) ?",
    "large galaxies at high redshifts could lie below the detection limit .",

    "( 1997 ) contains all morphological types and the distribution of @xmath10 , although ellipticals are preponderant in coma , may be affected by the presence of spirals and irregulars . 2 .   in an alternative approach we assumed that the galaxies at @xmath69 - again with the @xmath11 correction derived by the bcf active models - follow a schecter - type luminosity function with an @xmath73 ( ferguson and sandage 1991 ) . assuming that the luminosity profiles follow the de  vaucouleurs law",
    ", we can use the local kormendy relation to transform the distribution of absolute luminosities in a distribution of effective radii , according to the formula : @xmath74 . in this way we found again @xmath75 .",
    "although both estimates are based on rough approximations , they turn out to be robust with respect to changes of the models adopted for the @xmath11 corrections , the luminosity function parameterization and possible contaminations of the diameter and/or luminosity distribution functions .",
    "therefore we conclude that at @xmath69 a scarcity of large early - type galaxies is observed with respect to the local universe",
    ".    what type of selection effects may affect the present sample ?",
    "the choice of the @xmath0 as the selection band implies a bias at redshifts @xmath76 in favor of star - forming galaxies .",
    "so it is not surprising that at @xmath67 the observed colors of the galaxies favor the ` active ' models .",
    "galaxies following a ` passive ' or ` infall ' evolution , if formed at sufficiently large redshifts , quickly become too faint to be observable .",
    "so , a population of redder galaxies which had their major burst of star formation few e - folding times before the epoch of the observations would be undetected in the hdf .",
    "is also our perspective of the morphology of galaxies possibly biased by the fact that at @xmath76 the @xmath0 band is sampling the ultraviolet part of the sed ?",
    "the uv morphological properties of nearby elliptical galaxies are known to match those in the optical ( see oconnell 1997 and references therein ) , but for these systems the uv light is coming from evolved stars ( the uv upturn ) . on the contrary , in interpreting the morphology of star - forming galaxies at substantial redshifts , one must bear in mind that moving to uv wavelengths the light becomes proportional to the star - formation rates and not to the global stellar content of a galaxy . in principle",
    "the uv profiles could depart from an @xmath32 law , reflecting the comparatively more chaotic morphology of the star formation rather than the structural morphology of a galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , the sed of unreddened star - forming galaxies at high - z is essentially flat from @xmath77 to @xmath78 rest frame , and to even longer wavelengths if the galaxy is young . at the wavelength of the @xmath0 wfpc2 filter , this corresponds to observing galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath79 , with minimal @xmath6corrections ( see giavalisco et al .",
    "this means that it is not unfair to compare the uv morphologies of the @xmath80 galaxies with those of the @xmath81 systems . in order to check quantitatively this conclusion we produced , in the four wfpc2 available bands , the ` _ aperture _ ' luminosity profiles of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    "the sed of these galaxies ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) , obtained from the optical and infrared magnitudes in table 1 , clearly indicates star  forming activity .",
    "nevertheless , the fig .",
    "[ fig : profil ] shows that the light distribution in these objects is ostensibly the same in a wide range of rest  frame wavelengths ( from the @xmath88 band to the far-@xmath89 ) .",
