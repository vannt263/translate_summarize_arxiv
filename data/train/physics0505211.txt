    "the most impressive features of light scattering by subwavelength metallic nanostructures are resonant enhancement and localization of the light by excitation of electron waves in the metal ( for example , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the last few years",
    ", a great number of studies have been devoted to the nanostructures in metal films , namely a single aperture , a grating of apertures and an aperture surrounded by grooves . since the recent paper of ebbesen and colleagues@xcite on the resonantly enhanced transmission of light observed for a 2d array of subwavelength holes in metal films , the resonant phenomenon is intensively discussed in the literature.@xcite such a kind of light scattering",
    "is usually called a wood s anomaly . in the early researches , hessel and",
    "oliner showed that the resonances come from coupling between nonhomogeneous diffraction orders and eigenmodes of the grating.@xcite neviere and co - workers discovered two other possible origins of the resonances.@xcite one appears when the surface plasmons of a metallic grating are excited .",
    "the other occurs when a metallic grating is covered by a dielectric layer , and corresponds to guided modes resonances in the dielectric film .",
    "the role of resonant wood s anomalies and fano s profiles in the resonant transmission were explained in the study.@xcite    the phenomena involved in propagation through hole arrays are different from those connected with slit arrays . in a slit waveguide",
    "there is always a propagating mode inside the channel , while in a hole waveguide all modes are evanescent for hole diameters smaller than approximately a wavelength . in the case of slit apertures in a thick metal film ,",
    "the transmission exhibits enhancement due to a pure geometrical reason , the resonant excitation of propagating modes inside the slit waveguide.@xcite at the resonant wavelengths , the transmitted field increases via the strong coupling of an incident wave with the waveguide modes giving a fabry - perot - like behavior.@xcite in the case of films , whose thickness are too small to support the intra - cavity resonance , the extraordinary transmission can be caused by another mechanism , the generation of resonant surface plasmon polaritons and coupling of them into radiation.@xcite both physical mechanisms play important roles in the extraordinary transmission through arrays of two - side - open slits ( transmission gratings ) and the resonant reflection by arrays of one - side - open slits ( reflection gratings ) . a model of trapped ( waveguide ) modes has been recently used to show that an array of two - side - open slits can operate like a reflection grating totally reflecting te - polarized light.@xcite the surface plasmons and rayleigh anomalies were involved in explanation of reflective properties of such a kind of gratings.@xcite    the studies @xcite have pointed out that the origin of anomalous scattering of light by a grating of slits ( holes ) can be better understood by clarifying the transmission and reflection properties of a single subwavelength slit .",
    "along this direction , it was already demonstrated that the intensity of tm - polarized light resonantly transmitted through a single slit can be 10 - 10@xmath0 times higher than the incident wave@xcite and that the transmission coefficient versus wavelength possesses a fabry - perot - like behavior@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the reflection properties of the slit have received no attention in the literature .",
    "the very recent study@xcite only concerned the problem by regarding the total reflection of te - polarized light by a grating of two - side - open slits to properties of the independent slit emitters .    in this article , the backward scattering of light by a two - side - open subwavelength slit is analyzed . to compare properties of the light reflection with the extraordinary transmission@xcite",
    ", we consider the scattering of tm - polarized light by a slit in a thick metallic film of perfect conductivity . from the latter metal property it follows that surface plasmons do not exist in the film .",
    "such a metal can be described by the drude model for which the plasmon frequency tends towards infinity . the traditional approach based on the neerhoff and mur solution of maxwell s equations",
    "is used in the computations.@xcite the article is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical background , numerical analysis and discussion are presented in section  ii .",
    "the summary and conclusions are given in section  iii .",
    "the brief description of the model is presented in the appendix .",
    "it is well known that when a light wave is scattered by a subwavelength metallic object , a significant part of the incident light can be scattered backward ( reflected ) whatever the object be reflecting or transparent .",
    "it was recently demonstrated that an array of two - side - open subwavelength metallic slits effectively reflects light waves at the appropriate resonant conditions.@xcite one may suppose that this is true also in the case of a single slit . in this section , we test whether a light wave can be resonantly reflected by a single two - side - open subwavelength metallic slit . to address this question ,",
    "the energy flux in front of the slit is analyzed numerically for various regimes of the light scattering . in order to compare properties of the light reflection with that of the extraordinary ( resonant ) transmission@xcite , we consider the zeroth - order scattering of a time - harmonic wave of tm - polarized light by a slit in a perfectly conducting thick metal film placed in vacuum ( fig .

    "a very interesting behavior of the dispersion is that the coefficient @xmath32 versus the wavelength @xmath38 possesses a fabry - perot - like dependence that is similar to the anomalous behavior of transmission @xmath73 reported in the studies@xcite . in agreement with the studies@xcite , the height of the first ( maximum ) transmission peak is given by @xmath74 .",

    "the high peak amplitudes ( enhancement ) , however , are different from the low magnitudes ( attenuation ) predicted in the study@xcite , but compare well with the experimental and theoretical results@xcite .",
