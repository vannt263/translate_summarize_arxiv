    "spin - orbit ( so ) interactions in semiconductors reveal a variety of fundamental spin related phenomena.@xcite formation of stable spin helices with nontrivial temporal and spatial dynamics , @xcite spin optics,@xcite and spin - dependent sound radiation @xcite represent only some of these effects .",
    "spin currents,@xcite solely attributed to the spin - orbit coupling , provide a possibility of inducing and controlling spin motion by electrical and optical fields , and therefore became one of the key elements of the modern spintronics oriented at new device applications of semiconductor based structures .",
    "thorough investigations of realistic systems enlarge the variety of both fundamental phenomena and possible applications . as an example we mention that disorder  always present in real systems  plays a crucial role in the spin - hall effect @xcite , as the spin hall conductivity can be totally suppressed by any finite concentration of impurities .",
    "recently , symmetric gaas ( 110 ) quantum wells ( qws ) became the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "this is related to the expectation of the longest spin relaxation times in these structures , @xcite which in turn can lead to interesting spin dynamics.@xcite a stationary pure spin current accompanying an electric current in ( 110 ) qws was observed as reported in ref .",
    "so interaction in these systems , described by the dresselhaus term in the corresponding hamiltonian , @xcite conserves the electron spin along the axis normal to the qw plane for any electron momentum @xmath1 . as a result , random motion of an electron",
    "does not lead to a random direction of the spin - orbit field and therefore does not lead to spin relaxation . in reality",
    ", however , this spin component relaxes very slowly , and its analysis provides a test for the rapidly developing low - frequency spin - noise spectroscopy @xcite suitable for the measurements of the long spin evolutions .    in the case of perfect @xmath2 symmetry ( the axis @xmath3 is perpendicular to the qw plane ) , the rashba so interaction is zero . in real structures",
    ", however , the rashba coupling still exists in the form of a spatially fluctuating so field ( though being zero on average ) .",
    "@xcite this interaction induces spin - flip processes leading to the spin relaxation,@xcite and can be also responsible for generation of a nonequilibrium spin density due to the absorption of an external electromagnetic field .",
    "@xcite recently , it was proposed that this random so coupling can result in the spin orientation by an external current @xcite and also can play a role in the formation of the stripe structure of spin current distribution.@xcite    in this paper we propose a new possibility of exciting a steady pure spin current by a periodic external filed , extending thus the abilities of spin manipulation in real situations .",
    "in contrast to the conventional spin hall effect , which is linear in the external electric field , the proposed spin current is quadratic in the external periodic field .",
    "the effect is a result of the interplay of constant dresselhaus and spatially random rashba terms , and is not related to the spin currents produced by gate manipulation of the rashba coupling @xcite or adiabatic pumping in graphene.@xcite exact mechanism of the effect does not necessarily involve real spin - flip transitions of electrons between the spin - split subbands in ( 110)-oriented gaas qw , but relies on virtual spin - flip processes which renormalize the wave functions of electrons in a nonequilibrium state .",
    "this makes such a nonlinear current a physically new phenomenon , which appears if one accounts for more realistic effects than those described by the conventional rashba and dresselhaus models .    in section 2",
    "we describe the model and hamiltonian of the system .",
    "spin current is calculated in section 3 .",
    "summary and final conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "hamiltonian of a two - dimensional electron gas with the constant dresselhaus term @xmath4 and spatially fluctuating rashba spin - orbit interaction @xmath5 , subjected to external electromagnetic field described by the vector potential @xmath6 , takes the following form ( we use units with @xmath7 ) @xmath8 where the first two terms are @xmath9 the dresselhaus constant @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the corresponding bulk dresselhaus coupling parameter , is inversely proportional to the square of the qw width @xmath12 .",
    "the other components of the dresselhaus interaction vanish due to the specific symmetry of the ( 110 ) orientation.@xcite    the last term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) stands for the effects of the spatially nonuniform rashba so interaction , which can be written as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the rashba term for @xmath15 , @xmath16 with @xmath17 denoting the anticommutator and @xmath18 being the random rashba so interaction .",
    "the term @xmath19 , in turn , describes coupling of the electron spin to the external field @xmath6 _ via _ the rashba field , @xmath20 due to the assumed symmetry with respect to @xmath3-inversion , the spatially averaged rashba interaction vanishes , @xmath21 we assume that the random rashba field can be described by the correlation function related to fluctuating density of impurities near the qw,@xcite @xmath22 where the range function @xmath23 depends on the type of disorder .",
    "we assume the correlator of random rashba interaction in the momentum space in the form@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the spatial scale of the fluctuations .    in the absence of external field and random rashba",
    "so interaction , the hamiltonian @xmath26 describes the spectrum of spin - polarized electrons , @xmath27 .",
    "the energy bands of spin up and spin down electrons are thus shifted in opposite directions along the @xmath28 axis .",
    "the corresponding green function is then diagonal in the spin subspace , @xmath29 where @xmath30 for spin up ( @xmath31 ) electrons and @xmath32 for spin down ( @xmath33 ) electrons , whereas @xmath34 is the momentum and spin dependent relaxation rate .",
    "in the following we consider the @xmath3-component of a pure spin current flowing along the @xmath35 axis , that is the only component allowed by symmetry of the system under consideration .",
    "the operators of the electron velocity @xmath36 and the corresponding spin current tensor component @xmath37 are @xmath38=\\frac{k_{x}}{m}+\\alpha \\sigma _ { z}-\\lambda \\sigma _ { y } ,   \\label{5 } \\\\ & & \\hat{\\jmath}_{x}^{z}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { \\hat{v}_{x},\\sigma _ { z}\\right\\ } = % \\frac{k_{x}}{m}\\,\\sigma _ { z}+\\alpha ,   \\label{spincurrent}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath39-related terms correspond to the anomalous contribution to the velocity .",
    "the macroscopic spin current density is then given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the green s function of the system interacting with the external electromagnetic field .    upon substituting ( 10 ) into eq .  ( 11 ) one can note that the second term describes the current caused only by the electron density , @xmath42 conserved under any external perturbation .",
    "this conservation is achieved in calculations by an appropriate shift of the chemical potential @xmath43 . in equilibrium",

    "it is interesting to mention that the maximum value of @xmath84 which still can be considered as a perturbation , is determined by @xmath85 and , therefore , the maximum of @xmath78 is of the order of @xmath86 having the physical meaning of the equilibrium spin current induced by the random rashba spin - orbit coupling .    to understand better the physical mechanism of the nonlinear spin - current generation we consider a schematic picture presenting the electron energy bands as a function of @xmath28 without rashba random so interaction and without external field , see fig .",
    "[ bands ] .",
    "as we have already mentioned above , the dresselhaus so interaction leads to spin splitting of the electron states of a free electron gas , which results in the energy bands @xmath87 shown in fig .",
    "[ bands](a ) as a function of @xmath28 ( for @xmath88 ) .",
    "even though the states @xmath89 of these bands are spin polarized , the spin current in equilibrium is exactly zero .",
    "this is related to the zero current associated with each of the subbands , @xmath90 , calculated as the flux of electrons in each subband .",
    "obviously , vanishing current @xmath91 in the subband @xmath92 means that the spin current @xmath93 is also zero .",
    "distortions of the energy subbands either due to the random rashba interaction in eq .",
    "( [ hr0 ] ) or due to the external field in eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) do not break the condition @xmath94 .",
    "eq.([vkk ] ) ) of the spin - up and spin - down states , the effective spin @xmath95 in each subband decreases . ]",
    "our calculations , however , showed that nonzero matrix elements of field - induced spin - flip intersubband transitions appear in the presence of random rashba coupling .",
    "accordingly , in the nonequilibrium situation the electron states in each subband are a superposition of spin up and down states , so that the resulting state @xmath96 ( fig .  [ bands](b ) ) has a smaller effective spin .",
    "such mixing of @xmath97 and @xmath98 states effectively depends on @xmath99 and on @xmath100 , so that the above - mentioned spin mixing is different at different parts of the dispersion curves @xmath101 .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ bands](b ) for different spin subbands .    thus ,",
    "even though in nonequilibrium the current in each subband @xmath102 is zero , the associated spin current is not zero anymore .",
    "for example , in the @xmath103 band more up spins flow in @xmath104 than @xmath105 direction .",
    "correspondingly , in the @xmath106 band more down spins flow in @xmath105 direction .",
    "this results in the net spin - up current in @xmath104 direction .",
    "obviously , the direction of spin current is related to the sign of dresselhaus coupling constant @xmath39 .",
    "a remarkable change of the wave function by a strong electric field causes the injected pure spin current of the order of the equilibrium spin currents arising as a result of the rashba paradox.@xcite",
    "to conclude , we have proposed a new effect of the coherent nonlinear generation of a steady pure spin currents in gaas ( 110 ) quantum wells by electromagnetic wave .",
    "the injected spin current is proportional to the intensity of the external radiation , strongly depends on the frequency , and can be injected in the frequency range up to the fermi energy of the two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "physical mechanism of the effect is related to the virtual spin reorientation of electrons filling the spin subbands split by the dresselhaus interaction in the presence of a randomly varying rashba coupling .",
    "the latter may be introduced , e.g. by random doping of the quantum well . as a result",
    ", a spin hole virtually appears in the subband , leading to the light - induced spin current .",
