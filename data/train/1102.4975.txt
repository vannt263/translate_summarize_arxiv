    "complex networks theory is nowadays a common tool to analyze a broad class of phenomena in social , biological or physical sciences @xcite .",
    "an important issue in the field is to quantify the impact of topological properties of a network on its transport properties . as a paradigm of transport process , random walks on complex networks",
    "have been intensely studied @xcite , and the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) @xcite to a target node  which quantifies the time needed for a random walker to find a target on the network  has been widely used as an indicator of transport efficiency @xcite .",
    "a striking topological feature of many real - world complex networks is the wide distribution of the number @xmath0 of links attached to a node  the connectivity  , as exemplified by the now celebrated class of scale - free networks , such as internet @xcite , biological networks @xcite , stock markets @xcite or urban traffic @xcite , for which the connectivity is distributed according to a power law .",
    "the impact of connectivity on transport properties has been put forward in @xcite , where it was found in different examples that transport towards a target node can be favored by a high connectivity of the target , and different functional forms of the dependence of the mfpt on the target connectivity were proposed . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of the mfpt on geometric properties , such as the volume of the network and the source to target distance , has been obtained recently in @xcite , where it was shown that the starting position of the random walker plays a crucial role in the target search problem . in this context , quantifying the relative importance of distance and connectivity effects on transport properties on complex networks remains an important and widely unanswered question , which can be summarized as follows : is it faster for a random walker to find either a close , or a highly connected target ?    here , we propose a general framework , applicable to a broad class of networks , which deciphers the dependence of the mfpt both on the target connectivity and on the source to target distance , and provides a global understanding of recent results obtained on specific examples .",
    "our approach highlights two strongly different behaviors depending on the so  called type  compact or non compact  of the random walk . in the case of non compact exploration ,",
    "the mfpt is found to scale linearly with the inverse connectivity of the target , and to be widely independent of the starting point . on the contrary , in the compact case",
    "the mfpt is controlled by the source to target distance , and we find that unexpectedly the target connectivity is _ irrelevant _ for remote targets .",
    "this analytical approach , validated numerically on various examples of networks , can be extended to other relevant first - passage observables such as splitting probabilities or occupations times @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the mfpt denoted @xmath1 of a discrete markovian random walker to a target @xmath2 , starting from a source point @xmath3 , and evolving in a network of @xmath4 sites .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the connectivity ( number of nearest neighbors ) of site @xmath6 , and by @xmath7 its average over all sites with a flat measure .",
    "the corresponding degree distribution is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that at each time step @xmath9 , the walker , at site @xmath6 , jumps to one of the neighboring site with probability @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the propagator , i.e. the probability that the walker is at @xmath6 after @xmath9 steps , starting from @xmath12 .",
    "the stationary probability distribution is then given by @xmath13 , and it can be shown that detailed balance yields the following symmetry relation : @xmath14 which will prove to be useful .",
    "we consider networks with only short range degree correlations , namely such that @xmath15 for @xmath16 larger than a cut - off distance @xmath17 , where the average is taken over all pairs @xmath18 with @xmath16 fixed .",
    "this hypothesis is verified in particular by networks whose pearson assortativity coefficient @xcite is @xmath19 , such as erdos - renyi networks .",
    "it is however less restrictive since local degree correlations can exist , and many networks actually comply with this assumption , as exemplified below .",
    "the hypothesis of short range degree correlations implies in particular that the degree distribution in a shell of radius @xmath20 is identical to the degree distribution @xmath8 over the whole network , so that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of sites @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "we then introduce the weighted average at distance @xmath25 of a function @xmath26 of two space variables defined by @xmath27 and the standard flat average @xmath28",
    "we focus hereafter on transport processes having scale invariant properties .",
    "it this case , we can assume that the propagator in the infinite network size limit @xmath29 , after averaging over points at a distance @xmath25 from the starting point , satisfies the standard scaling for @xmath30 : @xmath31 where the fractal dimension @xmath32 characterizes the accessible volume @xmath33 within a sphere of radius @xmath25 , and the walk dimension @xmath34 characterizes the distance @xmath35 covered by a random walker in @xmath9 steps .",
    "a first central result of this paper is to show numerically that the dependence of the propagator on the connectivity of the target site can be actually made explicit and reads @xmath36 where the average is taken over sites @xmath37 at a distance @xmath25 from @xmath23 with fixed connectivity @xmath0 .",
    "an argument supporting the @xmath0 dependence hypothesized in eq .",
    "( [ scalingk ] ) is that it satisfies the symmetry relation of eq .",
    "( [ sym ] ) .",
    "numerical simulations on various examples of scale invariant networks , such as percolation clusters and @xmath38flowers ( see definition below ) validate this assumption , as shown in figs .",
    "[ propnoncompact ] and [ propcompact ] .",
    "we stress that the scaling form ( [ scalingk ] ) is verified in the cases of both compact ( @xmath39 ) and non compact ( @xmath40 ) exploration .",
    "we believe that this result on its own can be important in the analysis of transport processes on networks .",
    "we show next that it enables to obtain the explicit dependence of first - passage properties on the connectivity of the target site .",
    "we now extend the theory developed in @xcite to compute the mfpt of a discrete markovian random walker to a target @xmath2 , and obtain explicitly its dependence on @xmath41 . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the mfpt satisfies the following exact expression : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the pseudo - green function of the problem @xcite .",
    "note that averaging equation ( [ tm ] ) for @xmath3 covering the nearest neighbors of @xmath2 gives the expression of the averaged mfpt @xmath44 expected from kac formula @xcite : @xmath45 which we will use below .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the large @xmath4 limit of eq .",
    "( [ tm ] ) . making use of eq .",
    "( [ sym ] ) , we obtain    @xmath46    here @xmath47 is the usual infinite space green function defined by @xmath48 , and @xmath49 denotes equivalence for large @xmath4 .",
    "it is useful to notice that this leading term of the mfpt still satisfies the kac formula ( [ kac ] ) .",
    "we next take the weighted average of eq .",
    "( [ tmleading ] ) over the source points and obtain : @xmath50 where we defined @xmath51 . substituting the scaling ( [ scaling ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ tmleading2 ] ) then yields the large @xmath4 equivalence of the mfpt to a target site @xmath52 averaged over sources , which is valid for @xmath20 : @xmath53 in this expression the constant @xmath54 depends on the connectivity @xmath0 of the target and @xmath55 is a constant independent of @xmath0 ad @xmath25 , which depends on the scaling function @xmath56 .",
    "we now distinguish two regimes depending on the compact or non compact nature of the transport process , and focus on the large @xmath25 regime .",
    "in the compact case , @xmath57 , which corresponds to recurrent random walks , we obtain that the mfpt scales in the large @xmath25 limit as @xmath58 this shows that unexpectedly the mfpt is asymptotically independent of the connectivity of the target , while the dependence on the distance @xmath25 is crucial",
    "( [ scalingt ] ) is valid for @xmath25 large enough ( typically @xmath20 ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath0 , which impacts on the mfpt for @xmath25 small only , can be estimated by assuming that this expression still holds approximately for short distances .",
    "following @xcite , we take @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ scalingt ] ) and use the kac formula ( [ kac ] ) to obtain : @xmath61 which provides the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath59 .",
    "we next aim at evaluating @xmath55 .",
    "we introduce the weighted average of the mfpt over the target point @xmath62 . using eq .",
    "( [ scalingkac ] ) , this quantity writes : @xmath63 in the case of compact exploration , the continuous space limit can be defined ( see @xcite ) and imposes @xmath64 .",
    "this extra equation , based on the existence of a continuous limit , enables to evaluate @xmath55 as @xmath65 .",
    "note that for fractal trees ( @xmath66 ) we recover the exact result @xmath67 .",
    "finally one has : @xmath68 which fully elucidates the dependence of the mfpt on @xmath0 and @xmath25 .",
    "we recall here that this expression is originally derived for @xmath25 large , and that the small @xmath25 regime relies on the less controlled assumption that the scaling form of the propagator ( [ scalingk ] ) holds for any distance @xmath25 , and in particular that a continuous limit exists .",
    "it will however prove numerically to be accurate in various examples for all @xmath25 values .",
    "in the non compact ( or transient ) case , @xmath69 , we obtain that the mfpt scales in the large @xmath25 limit as @xmath70 this shows that the mfpt is independent of @xmath25 for @xmath25 large , as was already discussed in the literature @xcite . the dependence on @xmath0",
    "is now fully contained in the constant @xmath59 , which we now determine .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the fpt distribution is proportional to @xmath71 , with @xmath72 , and widely independent of @xmath25 in agreement with the result obtained in eq.([scalingnoncompact ] ) for the first moment .",
    "this implies that the global mfpt , defined as the mfpt averaged over all source points and denoted by @xmath73 , scales as @xmath74 . using the exact result derived in @xcite : @xmath75 we obtain that @xmath76 , and therefore asymptotically the infinite space green function @xmath77 , is independent of @xmath0 in the case of non compact exploration .",
    "this is checked numerically in fig .",
    "[ fig : htt ] . identifying in eq .",
    "( [ scalingt ] ) @xmath78 , which is finite in the case of non compact exploration , we finally obtain : @xmath79 as in the compact case this expression is valid for @xmath25 large , and becomes hypothetical for @xmath25 small .",
    "it reveals that in the case of non compact exploration , the mfpt is independent of @xmath25 for @xmath25 large , and scales as the inverse connectivity of the target .",
    "this behavior is in strong contrast with the case of compact exploration .",
    "finally our central result can be summarized as follows , where the case of marginal exploration ( @xmath80 ) has been obtained along the same line : @xmath81 \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{k}+ b \\ln ( r ) & \\!\\ ! \\textnormal { if } d_w = d_f\\\\[4 mm ] \\displaystyle \\frac{a}{k } - b r^{d_w - d_f } & \\!\\ ! \\textnormal { if } d_w < d_f \\end{array}. \\right .\\ ] ] this expression is very general and shows the respective impact of distance and connectivity on the mfpt . in particular",
    "the mfpt is _ fully explicitly determined _ in the compact case . the positive constants @xmath82 and",
    "@xmath55 depend on the network in the case of non compact exploration .",
    "we comment that in both cases the target connectivity @xmath0 plays an important role at short distances @xmath25 .",
    "however for large source - target distances @xmath25 , the @xmath0-dependence is damped out in the compact case , while it remains important in the non compact case .",
    "the @xmath25-dependence is found to be important in the compact case and largely irrelevant in the non compact case in agreement with previous results @xcite .",
    "the question raised in introduction can therefore be answered as follows : in the non compact case connected targets are found the fastest almost independently of their distance , while in the compact case close targets are found the fastest almost independently of their connectivity .",
    "[ rflowersk ]    we can conclude that for self - similar networks with short range degree correlations , the main criterion that governs the behavior of @xmath83 is the type ( compact or non compact ) of the random walk",
    ". in particular the existence of loops is irrelevant .",
    "further comments are in order .",
    "( i ) as stressed above , eq .",
    "( [ scaling4 ] ) is derived in the large @xmath25 regime .",
    "its applicability to the small @xmath25 regime relies on the assumption that the scaling form of the propagator ( [ scalingk ] ) holds for all values of @xmath25 , which is not always satisfied for real networks .",
    "in particular when degree correlations exist the relation @xmath84 obtained in the compact case gives only a rough estimate , and the result of eq .",
    "( [ scaling4 ] ) is valid only for @xmath25 larger than the correlation length .",
    "( ii ) our results can be extended to the case of non self - similar networks , still under the assumption that degree correlations are negligible . following the method developed above",
    ", one can infer that @xmath85 where @xmath86 does not depend on @xmath0 and satifies @xmath87 in the transient case , and @xmath88 in the recurrent case .",
    "the relative impact of connectivity and distance is therefore qualitatively the same as in the case of self - similar networks discussed above .",
    "( iii ) incidentally , our results straightforwardly yield the @xmath0 dependence of the mfpt averaged over all source points ( global mfpt ) .",
    "we find in the large @xmath4 limit : @xmath89 which complements previous results obtained in @xcite .",
    "this expression , along with eq .",
    "( [ global ] ) , yields as a by - product the large @xmath4 asymptotics of @xmath90 : @xmath91 this @xmath0-dependence of @xmath90 is checked numerically in fig .",
    "[ fig : htt ] and directly validates the @xmath0dependence of the global mfpt .",
    "we have checked our main result ( [ scaling4 ] ) on various examples of networks , corresponding to compact or non compact random walks as detailed below .",
