    "motivated by the recent discovery of massive planets on wide orbits , we explore the requirements for making gas giants at large separations from their host star via gravitational instability , hereafter , gi . in particular , we consider the formation mechanism for the system hr 8799 which contains three @xmath0@xmath1 objects orbiting at distances between @xmath0 30 and 70 au @xcite .",
    "the standard core accretion model for planet formation , already strained in the outer solar system , has difficulty explaining the presence of these objects .",
    "while gi is an unlikely formation mechanism for close in planets @xcite , for more widely separated planets , or sub - stellar companions , the viability gi - driven fragmentation deserves further investigation .    in the inner regions of a protoplanetary disk",
    ", gas can not cool quickly enough to allow a gravitationally unstable disk to fragment into planets @xcite .",
    "for this reason , core accretion  in which solid planetesimals collide and grow into a massive core which then accretes a gaseous envelope ",
    "has emerged as the preferred mechanism for forming planets at stellar separations @xmath2 au .",
    "planets at wider separations have only recently been discovered by direct imaging around the a - stars hr 8799 @xcite , fomalhaut @xcite , and possibly beta pic .",
    "searches at large radii surrounding solar - type stars have yet to turn up similar companions @xcite .",
    "standard core accretion models can not form these planets , though further investigation is warranted .    in favor of this possibility ,",
    "all three systems show some evidence of processes related to core accretion : all have infrared excess due to massive debris disks at large radii .",
    "this is at least partially a selection effect as these systems were targeted due to the disks presence .",
    "nevertheless , these debris disks are composed of reprocessed grains from collisions of planetesimals .",
    "the disks long lifetimes prohibit a primordial origin for small grains ",
    "they are removed quickly by radiation pressure and poynting - roberston drag @xcite and so must be regenerated from collisions between larger bodies that formed through the coagulation of solids at early times .",
    "therefore , planetesimal formation , a necessary ingredient in core accretion models , has taken place ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , other a - stars host planets at 12 au @xcite which , although they have a distinct semi - major axis distribution from planets orbiting g and m stars , are likely formed by core accretion . if future surveys demonstrate that this distribution extends smoothly to wide separation planets , then simplicity would argue against a distinct formation mechanism for the wide giants .",
    "yet the standard core accretion model faces a serious problem at large distances .",
    "the observed lifetimes of gas disks are short , at most a few myr @xcite .",
    "in contrast , typical core accretion times increase with radius and exceed 10 myr beyond 20 au . whether or not this theoretical difficulty can be overcome will require careful modeling of the interactions between planetesimals and the young gas disk .",
    "could wide orbit planets have formed at smaller radii , and migrated outwards ?",
    "@xcite , have investigated the possibility of forming the hr 8799 system via scattering in the absence of dynamically important gas , but find that putting three massive planets into such closely spaced yet wide orbits is unlikely . @xcite",
    "have suggested that under favorable circumstances outward migration in resonances might be feasible .",
    "alternatively , the core of a giant planet could be scattered outward by a planet , or migrate outward before accreting its gas envelope , either by interactions with the gas disk ( type iii migration ; e.g. @xcite ) or with planetesimals embedded in the gas ( capobianco , duncan , & levison , in prep ) .",
    "neither mechanism has yet been shown to move a core to such large distances , though this possibility has not been ruled out .",
    "given these difficulties , it is natural to search for other formation mechanisms , and gi @xcite stands out as a promising alternative . if any planets form by gi , the recently discovered directly imaged planets are the most likely candidates @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we examine this possibility in more detail , considering the expected mass scale of fragments and the effect of global disk evolution on the formation process .",
    "the inferred masses for the hr 8799 planets are close to the deuterium burning limit of @xmath3 @xcite . for simplicity , we take this as a the dividing line between planets and brown dwarfs and we refer to the hr 8799 objects as planets throughout .",
    "however , there is no reason for a given formation mechanism to function only above or below this threshold , and in fact , we will argue that if the hr 8799 planets formed by gi , their histories are more akin to those of higher - mass brown dwarfs than to lower - mass planets .    to constrain gi as a mechanism for wide giant planet formation , we set the stage by describing the hr 8799 system in  [ sec - hr8799 ] .",
    "we review the standard requirements for fragmentation in  [ idealgi ] and discuss the initial mass scale of fragments in  [ sec - masses ] . in ",
    "[ sec - giaccrete ] we show that under typical disk conditions , fragments will continue to accrete to higher masses .",
    "we then discuss important global constraints on planet formation provided by star formation models , disk evolution timescales , and migration mechanisms in  [ sec - starform ] , and ",
    "[ sec - migration ] .",
    "we compare predictions of our analysis with the known wide substellar companions and exoplanets in  [ sec - observe ] , suggesting that future observations will provide a definitive answer to the formation mechanism for hr 8799 . in the appendices we re -",
    "examine the heating and cooling properties of disks that are passively and actively heated , with special attention to the implications for irradiated disks , which become increasingly relevant for more massive stars .",
    "the planets around hr 8799 probe a previously unexplored region of parameter space @xcite because they are more distant from their host star .",
    "the three companions to hr 8799 are observed at separations from their host star of 24 , 38 , and 68 au .",
    "their masses , estimated using the observed luminosities of the planets in conjunction with cooling models , have nominal values of 10 , 10 , and 7 @xmath4 , respectively . a range in total mass of 1937 @xmath4 is derived from uncertainties in the age of the host star @xcite .",
    "interpretation of the cooling models generates substantial additional systematic uncertainty  recent measurements suggest that these models may overpredict the masses of brown dwarfs by @xmath025% @xcite .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that for planetary masses in the stated range , orbital stability over the age of the system requires that the planets occupy at least one mean - motion resonance , and that for doubly - resonant orbital configurations total masses of up to at least @xmath5 can be stable .",
    "hr 8799 has been called a  scaled - up solar system \" in terms of the stellar flux incident on its giant planets @xcite .",
    "however for understanding the formation of this system it is more useful to consider dynamical times , and disk mass requirements . because the dynamical time at fixed radius scales only as @xmath6 , the dynamical times are larger at the locations of the hr 8799 planets that at the solar system giants .",
    "since the total mass in planets greatly exceeds the @xmath7 in the solar system , we can infer that ( as with some other extrasolar systems ) the primordial disk around hr 8799 was more massive than the solar nebula and/or there was greater efficiency of planet formation , especially in the retention of gas .",
    "compared to solar system giants , longer dynamical times make core accretion more difficult and larger disk masses make gi more plausible .",
    "we first determine where , and under what local disk conditions , fragmentation by gi is possible .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we argue that for a disk with surface density @xmath8 and temperature @xmath9 to fragment , it must satisfy two criteria .",
    "first , it must have enough self - gravity to counteract the stabilizing forces of gas pressure and rotational shear , as quantified by toomre s q : @xmath10 @xcite , where @xmath11 is the isothermal sound speed of the gas with mean particle weight @xmath12 appropriate for a molecular gas , @xmath13 is the gravitational constant , @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath15 is the orbital frequency . equation ( [ eq - q ] ) specifies the onset of axisymmetric instabilities in linear theory that can give rise to bound clumps @xcite .",
    "the second criterion that must be satisfied for fragmentation to proceed is the so - called cooling time criterion .",
    "the heat generated by the release of gravitational binding energy during the contraction of the fragment must be radiated away on the orbital timescale so that increased gas pressure does not stall further collapse @xcite .",
    "this implies @xmath16 here @xmath17 is a constant of order unity , @xmath18 is the adiabatic index of the gas , and @xmath19 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "we take @xmath20 @xcite for disk vertical optical depth @xmath21 and gas opacity @xmath22 .",
    "numerical models of collapse in barotropic disks measure the critical value @xmath17 through the inclusion of a loss term @xmath23 in the equation for the internal energy , @xmath24 .",
    "estimates of @xmath17 range from @xmath25 , depending on @xmath18 @xcite , the numerical implementation of cooling @xcite , and the vertical stratification in the disk .",
    "we assume @xmath26 , appropriate for molecular hydrogen , and we adopt @xmath27 here . although @xmath17 was measured in disks whose temperature is controlled by viscous heating , we show in appendix [ sec - irradcool ] that the same expression ( modulo slightly different coefficients ) should apply when irradiation sets the disk temperature , as will be the case in disks prone to fragmentation ( see appendix [ sec - visc ] ) .    a disk satisfying toomre s criterion for instability ( equation [ eq - q ] ) but not the cooling time criterion ( equation [ eq - tcool ] ) experiences gi - driven angular momentum transport which regulates the surface density of the disk so that @xmath28 and @xmath29 does not reach substantially smaller values ( c.f .",
    "appendix [ sec - irradcool ] ) .",
    "we can therefore use toomre s criterion to define a relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath9 at fragmentation , as a function of period : @xmath30 where for convenience we define @xmath31 .",
    "we shall hereafter set @xmath32 .",
    "given equation([eq - sigmaq ] ) , we can rewrite equation([eq - tcool ] ) to generate a single criterion for fragmentation which depends on temperature and location : @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "somewhat counterintuitively , the critical cooling constraint requires that a disk be sufficiently hot to fragment .",
    "the value of @xmath35 depends on both @xmath15 and @xmath9 . evaluating this criterion relies on the disk opacity , which we return to in  [ sec - opacity ] .",
    "we take the initial mass of a fragment to be the mass enclosed within the radius of the most unstable wavelength , @xmath36 in a @xmath37 disk , or : @xmath38 @xcite , where @xmath39 is the disk scaleheight . @xcite",
    "have shown that even when the gi is non - axisymmetric , the most unstable axisymmetric wavelength @xmath40 is one of the dominant growing modes , suggesting that this is a reasonable estimate .",
    "while more numerical follow up will be necessary to pin down the true distribution of fragments born through gi , at present simulations show that this estimate may well be a lower limit , but is the correct order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "using equation([eq - sigmaq ] ) , we rewrite the fragment mass explicitly as a function of temperature and location : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "equation ( [ eq - mfragt ] ) demonstrates that at a given disk location , fragment masses depend only on temperature , with lower temperatures generating smaller fragments , subject to the minimum temperature required for fragmentation by equation([eq - tcoolb ] ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that there exists an absolute minimum fragment mass at any disk location , when the disk satisfies the equalities in equation([eq - q ] ) and equation([eq - tcool ] ) and has @xmath43 . the minimum temperature required for fragmentation scales as @xmath44 ( equation [ eq - tcoolb ] ) ,",
    "so the critical temperature and fragment mass are minimized at @xmath45 , the optical depth for which cooling is most efficient .",
    "the corresponding minimum mass as a function of location is : @xmath46 which occurs for disk temperatures : @xmath47 equation ( [ eq - minmass ] ) corresponds to @xmath37 , @xmath48 , and @xmath45 .",
    "this minimum mass is only achieved for temperatures consistent with @xmath49 .",
    "once an opacity law is specified which relates @xmath9 and @xmath50 , the problem becomes overconstrained these three criteria can only be satisfied at a single disk location , and equations [ eq - minmass]-[eq - mintemp ] are valid at only one radius in the disk .",
    "we now proceed to evaluate the critical disk temperatures and fragment masses for realistic opacity laws , demonstrating that planetary - mass fragments can only form at large separations from their host star .      at low temperatures , when @xmath51 k , ice grains are the dominant source of opacity @xcite . above @xmath0@xmath52",
    "k , ices begin to sublimate . in the cold regime applicable to the outer regions of protoplanetary disks , we consider two realistic opacity laws , one which is characteristic of grains in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and one which is characteristic of grains that have grown to larger sizes due to processes within the disk .",
    "we assume a rosseland mean opacity which scales as @xmath53 where the both the exponent , @xmath54 , and the constant @xmath55 are not well constrained in protoplanetary disks .",
    "they depend on the number - size distribution and composition of the dust grains , and on the dust - to - gas ratio . for ism like grains ,",
    "the rosseland mean opacity may be approximated by an opacity law with @xmath56 , or @xmath57 as long as the ice grains dominating the opacity are smaller than a few tens of microns .",
    "this opacity law is observationally confirmed in the ism ( * ? ? ?",

    "we choose @xmath64 which is valid for @xmath65 k and typical grain sizes of order 300@xmath66 ( see figure 6 of * ? ? ?",

    "specifically the measured opacities @xmath67 with @xmath68@xmath69 in the rayleigh - jeans tail imply particle growth toward the millimeter wavelengths of the observations @xcite .",
    "although most observed disks have had more time for grain growth to proceed , class 0 sources also show evidence of grain growth @xcite . alternatively , these objects could be optically thick at millimeter wavelengths , which would mimic the effects of grain growth .",
    "using these opacity laws we see that cooling proceeds with a different functional form in the optically thick and optically thin limits . in the optically thick regime , @xmath70 , which when combined with equation([eq - tcoolb ] )",

    "[ fig - tcool ] shows the dependence of the cooling time on disk temperature for each opacity law at two different radii . since fragmentation can only occur when @xmath76 , the minimum temperatures at which fragmentation is allowed are specified by the intersection of the cooling curves with the @xmath77 boundary .      for an optically thin disk with @xmath73 , equation([eq - tcoolcritthin ] )",

    "[ fig - a100 ] we illustrate how the two fragmentation criteria create a radius rather than temperature cutoff . at radii larger than the critical radius defined above , any @xmath80 combination which gives @xmath81 will fragment ( so long as the opacity law remains valid ) . at smaller radii , no combination of @xmath8 and @xmath9 which gives @xmath81 will fragment because the disk can not simultaneously satisfy the cooling time criterion .      as shown in fig .",

    "smaller values of @xmath85 move this boundary inward , allowing for fragmentation into lower mass objects at smaller radii , although the scaling with opacity is shallow .",

    "the temperature of a flared disk in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium is : @xmath87 where @xmath88 measures the grazing angle at which starlight hits the disk ; @xmath88 is dependent on the degree of disk flaring measured at the height of the photosphere @xcite .",
    "grain settling may reduce the height of the photosphere ( set here to 4 times the scaleheight ) and thus @xmath88 . for the standard radiative equilibrium model , the disk flaring scales approximately as @xmath89 .",
    "we shall find when we calculate the disk temperature that a gravitationally unstable disk remains optically thick , justifying the use of this formula .    to estimate the the stellar luminosity we use the stellar evolution models of @xcite , which include both nuclear burning and accretion energy .",
    "the accretion luminosity depends on both the current accretion rate and the accretion history ( in so far as it effects the stellar radius ) , so we obtain the lowest luminosity estimates by allowing the star to accrete at a constant , low accretion rate .",
    "we use the stellar luminosity after accreting to 90% of its current mass ( or @xmath90 assuming roughly 10% is still in the disk ) .",
    "we choose an accretion rate of @xmath91 as a lower bound because a star accretingat a lower accretion rate throughout its history has a formation timescale that is too long .",

    "these temperatures exceed the minimum threshold for fragmentation , and so the mass of fragments will be set by equation ( [ eq - mfragt ] ) .",
    "other analytic and numerical models of stellar irradiation predict temperatures in agreement with or higher than our estimate .",

    "we can compare it to two relevant mass scales : the disk isolation mass and the gap opening mass .    halting the growth of planetary mass objects",

    "however , even in this thin - disk limit , it is not clear that gi driven torques will exactly mimic viscous ones at gap - opening scales .    equation ( [ eq - gapmass ] ) implies that the gap opening mass is less than or equal to the fragment mass for effective viscosities consistent with gi .",

    "we now consider how the disk can reach the fragmentation conditions described in  [ idealgi ] in the context of a model for star formation . due to the effects of infall onto the disk , we find that planet formation via gi can only occur when the fragmentation epoch is concurrent with the end of the main accretion phase , as the protostar transitions from a class i to a class ii object @xcite .",
    "fragmentation at earlier times leads to the formation of more massive companions , while fragmentation at later times is unlikely because disks are too low in mass @xcite .      because the cooling time constraint is easily satisfied for expected disk temperatures , disks are likely driven to fragmentation by lowering @xmath29 . even when @xmath29 is above the threshold for fragmentation",
    ", torques generated by self - gravity ( e.g. spiral arms ) can drive accretion .",
    "when the infall rate onto the disk is low , a self - gravitating disk regulates its surface density and hence @xmath29 so that the torques are just large enough to transport the supplied mass down to the star , thereby avoiding fragmentation .",
    "however , gi can not process matter arbitrarily quickly because the torques saturate .",
    "thus the disk will be driven toward fragmentation if the infall rate becomes too high .",
    "this critical accretion rate is a function of disk temperature : @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that gi saturates at @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "if the infall rate onto the disk exceeds @xmath131 the disk can no longer regulate the surface density to keep @xmath29 just above unity , and fragmentation will occur .",
    "because the conversion of accretion energy to thermal energy at large radii is inefficient , disks can not restabilize through heating to arbitrarily high accretion rates @xcite .",
    "if fragmentation occurs due to rapid accretion , as described above , it is difficult to limit subsequent fragment growth . as demonstrated in  [ sec - gapstarve ] , gap opening does not limit accretion efficiently when the effective viscosity , in this case , @xmath132 , is high .",
    "a more general barrier to making small fragments during rapid infall is the large reservoir of material passing by the fragment as star formation proceeds @xcite . the specific angular momentum , @xmath133 , of accreting disk material typically increases with time ( modulo small random fluctuations in a turbulent core ) , landing at a circularization radius , @xmath134 , which is larger than the fragment s orbit .",
    "since the fragment s hill radius is roughly 10% of the disk radius , newly accreted material undergoes many orbits in the fragment s sphere of influence as it tries to accrete onto the central star , and some fraction will accrete onto the fragment itself .",
    "this process is less efficient if global gi modes drive fragments to smaller radii , because their hill radii shrink .",
    "however , growth to stellar ( or sub - stellar ) masses may still occur as long as migration timescales are not faster than accretion timescales .",
    "the latter scenario implies that the disk can not fragment at early times and still reproduce a single - star system like hr 8799 .",
    "the trend toward continued growth and even mass equalization following disk fragmentation is observed in numerous simulations with ongoing accretion @xcite .",
    "simulations of planet formation by gi with ongoing accretion also illustrate this behavior @xcite .",
    "consequently , if the hr 8799 planets formed by gi , they must have fragmented at the tail end of accretion from the protostellar core onto the disk . most likely , this requires that the protostellar core have properties such that its infall rate reaches the critical value in equation ( [ eqn - critmdot ] ) just as the core is drained of material . if this coincidence in timing does not occur , fragmentation produces a substellar , rather than a planetary , companion",
    ". whether fragmentation at this epoch can produce non - heirarchical orbits like hr 8799 remains to be explored .      driving",
    "the disk unstable with external accretion corresponds to excessive growth of fragments .",
    "it is therefore tempting to consider mechanisms to lower @xmath29 through disk cooling , while holding the column density fixed . because the disks are dominated by irradiation , changes in the viscous dissipation due to accretion are unlikely to affect a significant temperature change , and so lowering @xmath29 requires order of magnitude changes in the stellar luminosity due to the weak scaling of @xmath135 .",
    "fu orionis type outbursts can cause rapid changes in luminosity . to result in planetary mass fragments , the luminosity drop following an fu ori outburst would need to reach at least the minimum luminosity used in equation ( [ eq - mint ] ) on timescales shorter than an outer disk dynamical time .",
    "the accretion of gi formed embryos onto the protostar is a proposed source of the outbursts @xcite .",
    "if this occurs , perhaps a final generation of gravitational fragments , the so - called  last of the mohicans \" @xcite , would remain as detectable companions .",
    "although the lack of infall in this scenario might ease the gap opening constraints , fragments face all of the other difficulties discussed above in remaining low in mass .",
    "a final consideration for making wide orbit planets through gi is their subsequent migration history .",
    "if formed via gi , the hr 8799 planets had to migrate inward to their current locations .",
    "there is an independent reason to believe that migration did in fact take place in this system . as discussed by @xcite , the long term stability of hr 8799",
    "requires a resonant orbital configuration , most plausibly a 4:2:1 mean motion resonance , which likely resulted from convergent migration in the protoplanetary gas disk .",
    "we demonstrate below that while this history is plausible , it requires special disk conditions .",
    "inward type ii migration ( appropriate for gap opening planets ) is expected at formation , because the fragmenting region is within the part of the disk accreting onto the star .",
    "type ii migration of a single planet occurs on the disk viscous timescale : @xmath136 where we have used @xmath137 .",
    "this timescale is short enough to allow substantial migration during the lifetime of the gas disk .",
    "if fragments migrated inward independently , they could never become captured in resonance , as the innermost planet would migrate farther and farther from its neighbor . however , as shown in  [ sec - giaccrete ] , planetary gaps may overlap if they are within several hill radii of each other , comparable to the current separations between the hr 8799 planets .",
    "this overlap alters the torques felt by , and thus the migration of , the planets . as shown by @xcite , if multiple planetary gaps interact , convergent migration is possible .",
    "gap interaction allows an outer planet to shield an inner planet from the material , and thus torques , of the outer disk , slowing or halting its inward migration and allowing the outer planet to catch up .",
    "this mechanism is invoked by @xcite to generate convergent migration and resonance capture in the planets orbiting gj 876 .    under the assumption that gap overlap allows convergent migration and resonance capture ,",
    "we now ask : what is the overall direction of the subsequent migration ?",
    "we note that if the planets migrated a substantial distance after resonance capture , eccentricity damping by the gas disk was likely necessary ( c.f .",
    "we do not consider eccentricity damping further here .",
    "once two planets are caught in mean - motion resonance , the torque on an individual planet from the gas disk can cause both planets to migrate , with angular momentum transfer mediated by the resonance .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have argued that the torque imbalance on a pair of gap - opening resonant planets can even reverse the direction of migration , although this relies on a significant difference between planet masses .",
    "nevertheless , understanding the planets overall migration requires understanding how overlapping gaps alter the torque balance on the group of planets .",
    "guided by our interest in clean gaps that limit the growth of planets (  [ sec - giaccrete][sec - starform ] ) , we consider the following simplified problem .",
    "we imagine that the three planets have cleared , and are embedded in , a single large gap which is sufficiently clean that any disk gas passing through is dynamically unimportant .",
    "because the system is locked in a double mean - motion resonance , we assume that an imbalance in the torques acting on the two edges of the gap can cause all three planets to migrate .",
    "we can then ask : is there a sufficient flux of angular momentum from the outer disk to cause the planets to migrate inward with the viscous accretion of the disk ?",
    "when in the 4:2:1 resonance , the total angular momentum of the planets is roughly @xmath138 , where we have assumed that the planets are roughly equal in mass , @xmath139 , while @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the separation and keplerian angular velocity of the outermost planet . the angular momentum flux from the outer disk is large enough to move the planets on a viscous time @xmath142 when : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the mass flux through radius @xmath140 .    using the above inequality , we can calculate a critical disk surface density at the current location of the outer planet such that the disk can push the planets inward : @xmath145 for @xmath146 and our fiducial disk temperatures ( equation [ eq - mint ] ) , this constraint is always satisfied when @xmath37 .",
    "the disk is unable to cause inward migration when @xmath147 at 70 au , which is equivalent to @xmath148 .",
    "if the planets do share a clean common gap , a large fraction of the disk would be effectively cleared of gas while a massive outer disk is still present .",
    "a similar mechanism has been invoked to explain transitional disks , which contain holes at radii of a few tens of au and smaller @xcite .",
    "transport of disk gas through a less well - cleared gap could substantially alter this picture .    in summary",
    ", it is possible to envision a scenario in which the hr 8799 planets migrate inward to their current locations in such a way that their orbits converge , allowing resonance capture .",
    "this scenario is consistent with other constraints on gi planet formation : shortly after formation , the disk must have low accretion rates and decline in mass in order to ( a ) limit the growth of fragments , ( b ) allow for large , overlapping gaps .",
    "more stringent constraints will require future work on migration in gravitationally unstable disks , particularly in the presence of multiple planets massive enough to clear large , overlapping gaps .",
    "while there is a regime of parameter space in which planet formation is possible , typical conditions produce more massive ( @xmath149 ) companions .",
    "if gi fragmentation ever forms planets , then fragmentation should typically form more massive objects . consequently",
    ", these planets would constitute the low mass tail of a distribution of disk - born companions .",
    "if the mass distribution is continuous there should be more sub - stellar companions than planets at comparable distances of 50 - 150 au .",
    "observing this population is a strong constraint on the formation mechanism , but current data are insufficient to draw conclusions .",
    "have compiled the known sub - stellar companions in this range of radii to date .",
    "this range of separations falls beyond the well - established inner brown dwarf  desert \" @xcite , and has not been well probed due to observational difficulties at these low mass ratios .",
    "note that the overall dearth of brown dwarf companions to solar mass stars is not a selection effect .",
    "we illustrate the observational constraints by plotting the companions from along with the known exoplanets compiled by the exoplanet encyclopedia as a function of mass ratio and projected separation in fig .",
    "[ fig - bdplot]a , and as a function of minimum fragment masses and fragmentation radii in fig .",
    "[ fig - bdplot]b .",
    "we compare these with the hr 8799 planets , fomalhaut b , and the solar system giants .",
    "we distinguish between stars of different masses because disk fragmentation becomes more likely for higher mass stars @xcite .    at present , neither the population of substellar companions nor the population of exoplanets is continuous out to hr 8799 .",
    "many selection biases are reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig - bdplot ] , and these gaps in particular may be due to selection effects ; resolution and sensitivity make it difficult to detect both wide orbit planets , and close - in low mass brown dwarfs .",
    "we note that while there are actually fewer planets at distances less than 1 au , the cutoff above 5 au is unphysical .",
    "there is not yet any indication of an outer cut off radius in the exoplanets : if they continued out to larger separation , the distribution would easily encompass the hr 8799 and fomalhaut systems .",
    "data from ongoing surveys like that which found hr 8799 are necessary to verify the true companion distribution as a function of mass and radius .",
    "if these planets are formed through gi , we would expect observations to fill in the gap between hr 8799 and higher mass ratio objects to show a continuous distribution .",
    "if these planets are formed via core accretion , than observations may fill in the plot on the opposite side of hr 8799 , occupying a region of parameter space for which neither core accretion nor gi is currently a successful formation mechanism .",
    "we have demonstrated that while gi - driven fragmentation is possible at wide distances from a stars , fragment masses typically exceed the deuterium burning  planet \" limit .",
    "in contrast , the formation of sub - stellar and stellar companions is more likely because moderate disk temperatures and active accretion onto and through the disk drive disk - born objects to higher masses .    if the hr 8799 planets did form by gi , the following criteria had to be met :    1 .",
    "fragments should form beyond @xmath150 au : inside of this location the disk will not fragment into planetary mass objects even if @xmath151 .",
    "grain growth is required for fragmentation at the lower end of this range .",
    "2 .   temperatures must be colder than those of typical disks to limit the initial fragment masses .",
    "the disk must be driven unstable at a special time : infall onto the disk must be low , but the disk must remain massive ( e.g. the end of the class i phase ) .",
    "the disk must only become unstable to fragmentation at this point because earlier episodes of instability should lead to sub - stellar or stellar companion formation .",
    "the subsequent growth of fragments must be limited through efficient gap clearing necessitating low disk viscosity or early gap overlap .",
    "disk dispersal via photoevaporation may also be necessary .",
    "the three fragments must form at the same epoch separated by several hill radii , implying that the entire outer disk becomes unstable simultaneously .",
    "migration must be convergent .",
    "this likely requires the gaps of the planets to overlap so as to starve the inner most planet of disk material , thereby preventing runaway inward migration .",
    "if these conditions are met , then the planets in hr 8799 could comprise the low - mass tail of the disk - born binary distribution , the runts of the litter . in this case",
    "one would expect to find a larger number of brown dwarfs or even m stars in the same regime of parameter space  surrounding a - stars at distances of @xmath152 au .",
    "ongoing direct imaging surveys of a and f stars will provide a strong constraint on the formation mechanism for this system : if hr 8799 is the most massive of a new distribution of widely separated planets , our analysis suggests that formation by gi is unlikely . on the contrary ,",
    "the discovery of a population of brown dwarf and m - star companions to a - stars would corroborate formation via disk fragmentation .",

    "the cooling timescale to radiate away thermal fluctuations ( generated e.g.  by gi ) is @xmath168 where a temperature perturbation @xmath169 has an excess heat @xmath170 , and @xmath171 is the specific heat for a mean molecular weight @xmath172 and adiabatic index @xmath18 .",

    "the point is that the escaping flux varies by only an order unity factor between the strongly ( @xmath175 ) and weakly ( @xmath176 ) irradiated regimes .",
    "typical grain opacities , @xmath177 , ensure the correction is order unity ( and also ensure that we can ignore the catastrophic heating that would occur if @xmath178 ) .    combining equations ( [ eq - t_lumdef ] ) and  ( [ eq - deltaf ] ) with the definition of heat capacity we find that the cooling time is simply @xmath179 where the isothermal sound speed @xmath180 .    from this derivation",
    ", we see that the cooling time obeys the simple form of equation([eq - t_lum ] ) for all levels of irradiation  which only introduces an order unity @xmath54 correction .",
    "the cooling time depends on @xmath54 for weakly irradiated disks because changes to the opacity alter the amount of flux that escapes from the midplane . in highly irradiated disks ,",
    "opacity changes have little effect because the small difference between the midplane and surface temperatures drives a weak flux .",
    "while increasing the irradiative flux incident on a disk decreases the cooling time by raising @xmath9 , it will not trigger fragmentation in a @xmath96 disk , since it increases @xmath29 .",
    "we will not explore optically thin or convective disks at this time .",
    "we assume that @xmath181 is the fragmentation criterion independent of irradiation .",
    "when the cooling time is longer , the disk is presumed to enter a state of gravito - turbulence @xcite .",
    "we take this term to mean a quasi - steady state of gravitationally driven turbulence , on scales @xmath182 wherein viscous dissipation of gi turbulence regulates @xmath96 . thus the cooling time",
    "can be translated to a the critical value of @xmath109 at which gravito - turbulent accretion disks will fragment .",
    "while @xcite find that an @xmath109-threshold is more robust than one for @xmath183 when the adiabatic index varies , they did not include irradiation , which we contend would reveal that cooling is ultimately the more physical criterion , but the issue is best settled by simulation .",
    "the emitted flux with an @xmath109-viscosity and @xmath96 gives @xmath184 which combined with equation([eq - f ] ) and equation([eq - t_lum ] ) without the @xmath54 correction gives @xmath185 when irradiation is weak enough that @xmath186 , we recover the standard @xmath187 criterion for fragmentation ( ignoring the accumulated order unity coefficients ) . however for stronger irradiation with @xmath188 , fragmentation occurs for @xmath189 , a lower threshold .",
    "gravito - turbulent models require modification when @xmath190 , i.e.  an even lower level of irradiation than needed to affect the @xmath109 fragmentation threshold . in this case",
    "the disk shows some similarities to isothermal disks , and should have lower amplitude density perturbations , because there is insufficient viscous dissipation to support order unity thermal perturbations ( see the related discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we note that simulations of isothermal disks do develop gi , exhibit gi - driven transport and fragment @xcite , but they do not appear particularly turbulent .",
    "we now show that viscous heating is relatively unimportant in the outer reaches of irradiated a - star disks ( see also section 3 of @xcite ) . for an optically thick disk with an ism opacity law",
    ", balancing viscous heating and emitted radiation gives @xmath191 the solution for the midplane temperature is @xmath192 lower than the irradiation temperatures shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - cartoon ] by more than a factor of four .",
    "note that the surface density falloff @xmath193 is also quite steep for a constant @xmath194 , viscous disk with the ism opacity law .",
    "if the disk is optically thin , then the balance between heating and cooling gives : @xmath195 this temperature profile is shallow , but still colder than the irradiation temperature at large radii where the disk becomes optically thin ."
