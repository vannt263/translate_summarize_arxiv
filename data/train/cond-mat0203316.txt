    "spin glass physics is difficult . because of",
    "how complex it is to establish results that go further than the mean field level ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) frequently numerical simulations are the technique of choice ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently ground state techniques have become popular ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the big advantage here is that one is ( down in the broken phase ) surely as far as possible from the critical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "our goal is to observe the effects of the @xmath1 fixed point , and to remove spurious effects due to the critical point at @xmath4 : these contaminations are minimized when working at @xmath1 .",
    "also the use of exact ground states solves the problem of thermalization , that is typically very severe on spin glasses at low values of @xmath5 .",
    "the price one pays is that contacts with @xmath2 physics are not clear : it could even be ( but it does not seem to be so , and here we will help in showing that this is not the case ) that what happens at @xmath1 is essentially different from what happens for an even infinitesimal value of the temperature .    here",
    "we will use a further tool to check consistency of the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 phase space .",
    "thanks to off - equilibrium dynamical simulations we will be able to study large lattice sizes and restricted sectors of the phase space : this will allow to show better that @xmath1 physics is compatible with the results one obtains at finite values of the temperature .",
    "the second important part of this work is that , always thanks to off - equilibrium dynamical numerical simulations , we are able to keep under control crucial observables like overlap - overlap correlation functions and block overlaps .",
    "these observables are very important since they allow to discriminate potentially misleading situations like the ones where interfaces induce a seemingly non - trivial overlap probability distribution @xmath6 from a true replica symmetry breaking .",
    "we have simulated a three dimensional ( @xmath0 ) ising spin glass with gaussian couplings on a cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath7 where the sum runs over all couples of nearest neighbors , the @xmath8 are ising spins and the couplings @xmath9 are quenched random gaussian variables with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "we have mainly focused on the measurements of two very important observables : they are both useful to distinguish situations where a true non - trivial behavior of the probability distribution of the overlaps is present from situations where interfaces could present a misleading situation ( because of finite size effects or even in the infinite volume limit , see the discussion in @xcite and references therein )    the first observable is an overlap , i.e. the measurements of how similar two typical configurations at equilibrium are . here we define the overlap only in a small part of the lattice : we compute the block overlap @xmath10 on a @xmath11 cube ( that we call a @xmath12-cube , here with @xmath13 ) : @xmath14 with the usual site overlap @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two independent equilibrium configurations of the system in the same realization of the quenched disorder .",
    "we call , as usual , @xmath18 the total overlap computed on all the lattice , i.e. the average of the site overlap @xmath19 over all lattice sites .",
    "we notice also that in the following we will , as usual , denote with brackets the thermal average for one given realization of the quenched disorder , @xmath20 : when averaging at a given monte carlo time @xmath21 we will mean averaging over different realizations of the dynamical process , and we will indicate this average with @xmath22 .",
    "we will denote with an over - line the average over the quenched disorder , @xmath23 .",
    "we have computed the full probability distribution @xmath24 of the @xmath25 block overlap @xmath10 as a function of the temperature @xmath5 and the ( monte carlo ) time @xmath21 of a so - called _ off - equilibrium dynamics_. in an off - equilibrium numerical simulation ( see for example @xcite ) we use a `` very large '' lattice size , and we work at values of the temperature low enough to make sure that the system is not thermalized : this is true already for medium size lattices in the case of system that are characterized by slow dynamics , as is the case here . in this situation",
    "we work by extrapolating off - equilibrium , finite time measurements to infinite time .",
    "the advantage of the method is on one side in the fact that we are basically free from finite size effects , and on the other side that we can learn additional information from the pattern of the approach to equilibrium ( for example in @xcite this turns out to be a nice way to learn about the minimal value of the allowed overlap , @xmath26 ) . on the other side",
    "the disadvantage is that we have to rely on an extrapolation to infinite time , that can turn out to be not so trivial .",
    "the second relevant observable is the overlap - overlap correlation function ( defined on the full lattice ) computed at distance @xmath27 , and it is defined as @xmath28 here we will only analyze @xmath29 , since among all the different @xmath30 for different @xmath31 values it is the less affected by statistical errors .    in our working conditions",
    "@xmath32 depends on the initial total overlap probability distribution @xmath33 . in our case , since we have used very large lattice sizes , since we are starting from an average zero overlap ( we start by evolving two independent , uncorrelated random configurations ) and since we are limited to a number of monte carlo sweeps ( of the full lattice ) of the order of @xmath34 , we are not able to change away from zero the total overlap , and at least roughly we have that @xmath35 . because of that we have that the correlation functions we measure are very different from the equilibrium correlation functions , and can be written as @xmath36 where by @xmath37 we denote the spatial correlation functions at time @xmath21 and temperature @xmath5 computed by including only couples of configurations having total overlap @xmath18 , and by @xmath38 we denote the correlation functions computed with initial conditions @xmath33 .    in the numerical simulations that we will discuss in the following we have been starting from an initial probability distribution peaked around zero total overlap , i.e.",
    "our results are determined by the value of @xmath39 . in other terms",
    "we are discussing here the dynamics of the @xmath40 sector of the system ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "as we have stressed in the introduction , our main goal here is to relate numerical results computed from an off - equilibrium dynamics at non zero temperature with equilibrium results obtained at zero temperature using techniques that give exact ground state configurations on reasonably lattice sizes ( see for example  @xcite ) .    in the recent studies computing spin",
    "glass ground states the technique of choice was based on computing the so - called _ mixed overlap _ ,",
    "i.e. the overlap computed between a ground state in a finite volume with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) in all directions and another ground state obtained when imposing anti - periodic boundary conditions ( abc ) in one direction and pbc in the other directions of the cubic lattice with the same realization of the quenched couplings @xmath41 . in a theory with",
    "continuously broken replica symmetry @xcite in the infinite volume limit there are many ground states with total site overlap @xmath18 and total _",
    "link overlap _ @xmath42 ( that coincides with the correlation function @xmath30 computed at distance 1 ) different from one @xcite . on the contrary a droplet approach",
    "@xcite implies a behavior similar to the one of an usual ferromagnet , where the link overlap ( and the site overlap if we activate an infinitesimal magnetic field ) go to one in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite compute the @xmath43 block overlap .",
    "now a key remark is in order .",
    "the procedure we have just described to compute overlaps in the ground state sector leads to the comparison , if the rsb picture holds , of ground states with @xmath40 ( changing the boundaries we favor ground states with small overlap ) : that means that these results based on ground states describe the link overlap in the @xmath40 sector of the system .",
    "this is the main reason of interest of these dynamical simulations : we are simulating here the @xmath40 sector of the theory , and since we are working on very large lattice sizes we are only sampling this sector .",
    "in other words when extrapolating our measurements of @xmath44 ( by the subscript @xmath45 we mean we have already extrapolated , hopefully faithfully , to @xmath46 ) from our low values of the temperature @xmath5 down to @xmath1 we should find , if the rsb picture is consistent , the same results found in the direct analysis of the ground states .    we will also try to check the behavior of a different relevant observable . in @xcite",
    "the authors have computed the probability that , for example , a @xmath13 block does not intersect an interface : one can relate this probability to the probability of finding that a @xmath25 block is @xmath47 .",
    "again our strategy will be to compute the probability of this event at non zero temperatures and to extrapolate the result down to @xmath1 .",
    "a very direct relation about the second moment of the ( @xmath25 ) block overlap and the @xmath48 correlation function [ e - c ] can be established by noticing that @xmath49 \\ .",

    "our numerical simulations have been run on a * ape100 * parallel supercomputer @xcite : on the more powerful version of the computer ( the so - called `` tower '' version ) our monte carlo code for simulating @xmath0 ising spin glasses with gaussian couplings has a peak performance of 5 gf .    for all the numerical simulations described in this note we have averaged our data on four different realizations of the random quenched disorder . in each disorder realization we have simulated two independent copies of the system ( useful to compute the different overlaps , block overlaps and correlation functions ) .",
    "we have used a straightforward metropolis algorithm .",
    "we have used a lattice of linear size @xmath50 and volume @xmath51 .",
    "we have analyzed two kind of runs .",
    "`` short '' runs have been used to compute the extrapolated value of the overlap - overlap correlation function . in these short runs",
    "we have simulated temperatures @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 during @xmath60 monte carlo steps .",
    "we have presented a preliminary and partial analysis of some of these data in reference @xcite ( only for @xmath61 and only as far the dependence of the critical exponents over temperature is concerned : we had not analyzed , for example , the prefactors , which are very relevant to the physics studied in this paper , see below ) .    in",
    "the `` short '' runs we use a simple scheme .",
    "we start from two initial independent random configurations , and suddenly start iterating at the working temperature well below the critical one : @xmath62 ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 or @xmath59 ) . at each @xmath5 value",
    "we will eventually extrapolate to infinite time , to get a @xmath5 dependent asymptotic value , that we will , in turn , try and extrapolate down to @xmath1 .    in order to compute the dynamical behavior of the block overlap",
    "we have used `` long '' runs .",
    "here we have used the previous scheme for four values of the temperature , @xmath63 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath58 , with @xmath64 monte carlo updates of the full lattice performed at each value of @xmath5 .    in",
    "the `` short '' runs we measure the time dependent observables on logarithmic time scales : i.e. at times @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 ,  in the `` long '' runs we measure every 32768 steps .    in the next two subsections we will discuss separately our numerical results for the correlation functions and for the window overlap .      in this section",
    "we will always indicate by @xmath29 the @xmath40 component of the overlap - overlap correlation function , i.e. @xmath69 , that , as we have discussed in detail in section [ s - model ] , is the quantity we are measuring .    the dependence of @xmath29 on time can be expressed through the knowledge of the dynamical critical exponent @xmath70 ( that depends on @xmath5 ) .",
    "we have that @xmath71 from numerical simulations  @xcite ( that here are in very nice agreement with real experiments  @xcite ) we know that @xmath72 another useful piece of information  @xcite is that @xmath73\\ , , \\label{eq : ansatz}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the time dependent _ dynamical correlation length _ of the system . because of that we expect that @xmath75 asymptotically for large time .",
    "as @xmath21 diverges @xmath29 tends to the constant value @xmath76 , that we have called prefactor in the previous section .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cor_low ] we show the extrapolation of @xmath77 to @xmath46 for the lowest temperature we use , @xmath78 ( this is the most difficult extrapolation , and fits at larger @xmath5 values are easier ) .",
    "the dashed line is for the best fit to the form @xmath79 the fit is good , and the extrapolation looks reasonably safe . by this kind of fits",
    "we are able to obtain reliable extrapolated values for all the values of @xmath5 we study , that we show in figure [ fig : extra ] versus the temperature @xmath5 .",
    "we have checked that the value of @xmath80 of the best fit to the form [ eq : fit ] is in very good agreement ( i.e. inside the margins suggested by the estimated statistical error ) with the value of @xmath81 .",
    "the discrepancies between the extrapolated value obtained by using a three or two parameter fit ( i.e. by fixing @xmath80 to @xmath81 in equation [ eq : fit ] or by letting it free ) are inside the statistical errors .",
    "for a detailed numerical study of the functional form suggested in equation [ eq : fit ] we refer the reader to references  @xcite .",
    "an exhaustive analysis of the correlation functions computed at zero total overlap has been performed in three  @xcite , four  @xcite and six dimensions  @xcite : in all cases the system turns out to have a very similar behavior , independently of the spatial dimensionality . in six dimensions",
    "the agreement with the quantitative analytical predictions obtained by de dominicis , kondor and temesvari  @xcite is very good  @xcite .    in the same figure",
    "we have also plotted the statistical interval allowed for the value of the link overlap at @xmath1 from ground state calculations ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the statistical error on our values of @xmath82 grows when @xmath5 decreases , but in the limit given by these errors the @xmath1 result and a reasonable extrapolation of the finite @xmath5 results obtained here look completely consistent .",
    "the interval we have drawn in the figure is @xmath83 , and we have computed it by looking at data from  @xcite . we have used the four different ( but statistically compatible ) values obtained there for @xmath42 . by extrapolating of @xmath42 for @xmath84",
    "one obtains @xmath85 or @xmath86 using a linear or a quadratic fit in @xmath87 , respectively . by studying correlation function reference  @xcite also obtained @xmath88 ( for the transverse correlation ) and @xmath89 ( for the perpendicular correlation ) . taking into account all these figures",
    "we have obtained the confidence interval ( at one standard deviation ) for the link overlap that we were quoting before .",
    "our second set of measurements concerns the so called _ block overlap _ ( that we also call _ window overlap _ or _ box overlap _ , and have been computed on a @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath11 box ) .",
    "as in the case of correlation functions we start from two independent random configurations , and cool them down according to the annealing schedule we have described before ( using what we have called the `` long '' runs ) . during these runs we have computed the full probability distribution of the window overlap at different times @xmath21 .    in this section of this note our main goal is to compute @xmath92 , i.e. the value ( extrapolated to infinite time first and than @xmath1 later ) of the probability that a @xmath12 block has overlap of maximal modulus . to simplify the notation from now on we will be working with a symmetrized overlap probability distribution ,",
    "i.e. we will consider @xmath93 , that can have support in @xmath94 : this object is interesting because it is exactly the probability that the interface between different phases does not intersect with a cube of size @xmath95 . as we have already discussed this probability",
    "has been computed in reference  @xcite at @xmath1 , and we will try here to connect these results with the @xmath2 physics .",
    "the main result of reference  @xcite is that , at @xmath1 and in the limit of the lattice size @xmath96 , @xmath97 our working ansatz for the time dependence of @xmath98 has been , as we will justify now , that @xmath99 and we have used @xmath100 .",
    "let us see why things work in this way . from equation [ eq : test ] we know that @xmath101 scales as an overlap - overlap correlation function .",
    "but for large times , and for distances such that @xmath102 equation [ eq : ansatz ] tells us that the correlation function behaves as @xmath103 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath104 is a suitable constant .",
    "this implies in turn that @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are constants that only depend on @xmath5 .",
    "now since @xmath108 if we define @xmath109 it is clear that @xmath110 things are more clear if we write equation [ eq : q2 t ] for discrete values of @xmath10 ( that is what happens for finite @xmath12 ) : @xmath111 if we assume that all the components with @xmath112 scale in the same way this shows that @xmath113 and so , @xmath114 and we recover [ pqscaling ] taking logs in [ eq : pqscaling_b ] .",
    "we have used [ pqscaling ] instead of [ eq : pqscaling_b ] since we have ( slightly ) better scaling even for small times .",
    "we have checked that both kind of fits provide us with compatible values of @xmath115 .",
    "we will use equation [ pqscaling ] to fit the values of @xmath116 at different temperatures .",
    "the argument we have done says nothing about the behavior of @xmath117 , while @xmath118 for @xmath119 follows the same scaling law valid for @xmath120 .",
    "we have checked that our numerical data are well fitted by the behavior of equation [ pqscaling ] .",
    "we show two plots corresponding to two different temperatures : @xmath63 and @xmath121 , in figure [ fig : pq1_extra ] .",
    "in the plots we also draw our best fits to to the ansatz [ pqscaling ] .",
    "the fit of figure [ fig : pq1_extra ] for @xmath63 , for example , looks reasonably reliable .",
    "the @xmath122 depends very slowly on @xmath5 , and our numerical data have as support a range of times as large as the range we need to extrapolate through . on the contrary",
    "the fit of [ fig : pq1_extra ] for @xmath121 ( again , the one at our lowest @xmath5 value , i.e. our most difficult fit ) looks less happy even if one would not expect very strange things to happen : since @xmath123 at such low @xmath5 is becoming very small our data vary on a small support , and the @xmath46 point looks far away . the very large error that appears in figure [",
    "fig : extra_pq_1 ] is an effect of this phenomenon .    in figure",
    "[ fig : extra_pq_1 ] we show the values of @xmath124 extrapolated up to @xmath46 versus @xmath5 . because of how difficult it is to get precise results at low @xmath5 values , the evidence we have established is not very strong : still , figure [ fig : extra_pq_1 ] clearly shows that our present low @xmath5 results are completely compatible with the @xmath1 results .",
    "we end this section by performing a last consistency check .",
    "we compare the values of @xmath125 with the values of the correlation function ( in both cases extrapolated to infinite time ) .",
    "using equation [ eq : ansatz ] we can write equation [ eq : test ] as : @xmath126 in table [ table1 ] we show the values of @xmath127 obtained by direct measurements of @xmath10 and the value obtained by summing up correlation functions , according to the right hand side of equation [ finaltest ] : the agreement of the two quantities is very reasonable at all @xmath5 values .",
    "the values of @xmath128 have been extrapolated at infinite time by using equation [ eq : extra ] .",
    ".test of relation [ finaltest ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the results of our investigation are indeed positive .",
    "physical observables computed at @xmath1 are compatible with values computed on large lattices thanks to an off - equilibrium dynamics , and extrapolated from measurements at low , finite @xmath5 .",
    "our observables of choice are interesting observables , since they do not only show that our system has a non - trivial @xmath6 , but also that this non - trivial @xmath6 is the `` bona fide '' effect of replica symmetry breaking , and not the effect of some fancy kind of interfaces .",
    "we have been able to use very low @xmath5 values , while still keeping a good control over @xmath129 fits . when we lower @xmath5 and eventually @xmath130 the data are collapsing , in the reasonable accuracy given by the large statistical error , to the @xmath1 results .",
    "it is important to remark , also as far as planning future , more precise studies is concerned , that it is really very difficult to run accurate numerical simulations in the region @xmath131 with the nowadays computers ( for example at @xmath132 the dynamical critical exponents is of the order of @xmath133 ) .",
