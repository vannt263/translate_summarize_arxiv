    "more and more star clusters and galaxies with wide variety of chemical abundance mixtures are found from detailed high resolution spectroscopic observations . in order to address and examine those chemically different stellar systems ,",
    "we have begun developing a stellar population models with flexible chemistry .",
    "dotter et al . ( 2007 , apj submitted ) have recently calculated stellar evolution models with varying chemical abundance mixtures besides solar - scaled one .",
    "ten chemical elements ( c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ca , ti , and fe ) are individually enhanced by 0.3 dex at a constant total metallicity ( z = 0.02 ) .",
    "moreover , additional alpha - enhanced stellar models are calculated in order to understand those alpha - element effects collectively ( for example , lee & worthey 2005 ) .",
    "especially , these new sets of stellar evolution models have carefully incorporated matching _ ab initio _ low and high temperature opacities .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) will present in full the effects of those element by element altered isochrones as well as those from synthetic stellar model atmosphere on top of isochrones effects .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates the isochrone effects ( dots ) and that of both isochrones and stellar model atmosphere ( lines ) at fe5270 vs. mg b diagram .",
    "it seems that stellar model atmosphere effects are hefty for some cases compared to isochrone effects alone . because of our regulation of a fixed total metallicity in this experiment ,",
    "note that oxygen enhancement implies mg and fe deficiency , and that alpha - enhancement implies mostly depressed fe abundance .",
    "support for this work was provided by the nsf through grant ast-0307487 , the new standard stellar population models ( nsspm ) project .",
    "lee also thanks the organizers for their wonderful hospitality and financial support ."
