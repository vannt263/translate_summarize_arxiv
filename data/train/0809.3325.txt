    "the equation of state for nuclear matter under exotic conditions is one of the main topics in modern nuclear physics .",
    "this interest in the properties of nuclear matter at high densities and large proton - neutron asymmetries is partly motivated by the fact that this information is required in theoretical models of compact objects in astrophysics like neutron stars or the simulation of supernovae . however , the study of nuclear systems with large isospin asymmetries are also the subject the forthcoming radioactive - ion - beam facilities such as fair at gsi or spiral2 at ganil .",
    "different ways have been developed to obtain predictions for the properties of nuclear systems under exotic conditions .",
    "one way is to start from phenomenological models which successfully describe the properties of stable nuclei .",
    "a very popular approach along this line is the use of an effective density dependent skyrme - type interaction@xcite .",
    "modern skyrme parameterizations have been developed , which were constrained in their fitting procedures to obtain results for neutron - rich nuclear matter compatible to those of microscopic calculations .",
    "here we mention the skyrme - lyon ( sly ) forces@xcite , which have been used in studies of the neutron - star crust@xcite .",
    "also the relativistic mean - field approximation has very successfully been used to describe the properties of stable nuclei@xcite .",
    "attempts have been made to derive a set of density - dependent meson - nucleon coupling constants of density dependent relativistic mean field ( ddrmf ) calculations from microscopic dirac brueckner hartree fock calculations with a readjustment in order to reproduce the bulk properties of stable nuclei and the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "the parameters of such skyrme hartree fock and ddrmf calculations have been fitted to the data of stable nuclei and the predictive power of these simple phenomenological approaches could be rather limited .",
    "this would mean that the predictions for nuclear systems with exotic values for density and proton - neutron asymmetries may not be very reliable .",
    "therefore we will also consider some so - called microscopic approaches , which start from models of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction , which are adjusted to describe the experimental phase shifts of nn scattering at energies below the pion threshold@xcite .",
    "the traditional models of such realistic nn interactions like e.g. the charge - dependent bonn potential cdbonn@xcite or the argonne potential v18@xcite contain rather strong short range components , which make it inevitable to employ non - perturbative approximation schemes for the solution of the many - body problem for the nuclear hamiltonian based on such interactions@xcite .",
    "such non - perturbative approximations include the brueckner hole - line expansion with the brueckner hartree fock ( bhf ) approximation , the self - consistent evaluation of green s function using the t - matrix approximation@xcite ( scgf ) and also variational approaches using correlated basis functions @xcite .",
    "if such microscopic calculations would reproduce the properties of nuclear systems under normal conditions , one could argue that a scheme which reproduce the data of two nucleons in the vacuum ( nn phase shifts ) as well as nuclear data at normal densities should also provide reliable results for nuclear systems at densities beyond the saturation density of nuclear matter . unfortunately , however , such microscopic calculations fail to reproduce the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter or the bulk properties of finite nuclei with good precision@xcite .",
    "for example in nuclear matter such calculations yield results for the saturation point , which are located on the so - called coester band@xcite , i.e. they either yield too little binding energy or a saturation density well above the empirical value of @xmath2 = 0.16 @xmath3 .    in recent years",
    "large progress has been made developing tools for essentially exact calculations for nuclear system with mass number up to about @xmath4@xcite .",
    "these calculations demonstrate that using realistic models for the nn interaction in a non - relativistic hamiltonian precise results for nuclear systems are obtained if and only if these realistic two - body interactions are supplemented by a three - body force",
    ".    therefore we will consider in the present study the results of bhf and scgf calculations , adding a simple density - dependent contact interaction which is adjusted to describe the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter .    during the last years a different calculation scheme has evolved , which is also based on the nn scattering data but tries to decouple the low- and high- momentum components in the nuclear hamiltonian using renormalization group methods@xcite .",
    "the interaction resulting for the low - momentum regime of nuclear structure , which we will refer to as @xmath0 is rather soft , which implies that non - perturbative tools of many - body theory can be applied@xcite .",
    "also it is very attractive , that @xmath0 turns out to be essentially model - independent , if the cut - off for the low - momentum regime is chosen appropriately .",
    "however , evaluating the properties of nuclear matter by using @xmath0 in a hartree - fock or bhf calculation , one does not obtain a saturation point@xcite , the binding energy per nucleon increases with increasing density and nuclear systems tend to collapse to high densities .",
    "this will be compensated by adding a density - dependent contact interaction , which is adjusted in the same fashion as for the bhf and scgf cases discussed above .",
    "therefore we will apply two different schemes : two phenomenological methods ( skyrme hartree fock and relativistic mean field ddrmf ) employing parameterizations , which tend to reproduce some features of microscopic calculations and three microscopic approaches ( bhf , scgf and hartree - fock with @xmath0 ) , which are supplemented by a simple contact interaction to reproduce the empirical saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "for all these methods we study bulk features of nuclear matter at large densities and proton neutron asymmetries . a comparison of the resulting values for nuclear compressibility , symmetry energy , proton fraction in @xmath1 equilibrium and effective masses , which characterize the density of states around the fermi energy , should provide information about the uncertainties in the extrapolation of nuclear properties in exotic regions of density and asymmetry . also we expect some hints about the reliability and problems of the individual approaches .",
    "after this introduction the section two shall briefly outline the different approximation schemes which we are going to consider .",
    "the results are discussed in section three and the main conclusions are summarized in the final section .",
    "a very popular many - body approach in nuclear physics is the skyrme - hartree - fock approach which can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the skyrme interaction leads to an energy functional @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hamiltonian density in the hartree - fock approximation . in case of infinite asymmetric nuclear matter the hamiltonian density writes @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kinetic energy term , @xmath9 an effective mass term , @xmath10 a zero range term and",

    "we obtain the kinetic energy density by @xmath25 the hamiltonian density leads to the energy per nucleon @xmath26 and the single particle energy may be written as a function of momentum @xmath27 @xmath28 with an effective mass @xmath29 and a density dependent potential @xmath30 .",
    "starting from realistic nn interactions , we have to use more advanced many - body approximations like the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approach , which have the capability to account for the effects of correlations , which are due to the strong tensor and short - range components of such realistic nn interactions . in the bhf approximation",
    "this is achieved by evaluating the so - called @xmath31-matrix , which corresponds to the in - medium scattering matrix .",

    "however , the single - particle spectrum is often parameterized in the form of an effective mass @xmath50 so that a so - called angle - averaged propagator can be defined , which reduces the bethe - goldstone equation to an integral equation in one dimension . the exact pauli operator has been treated in @xcite .      an interesting extension of the bhf approach is the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach which accounts for relativistic effects as well as correlation effects as described in terms of the g matrix . in the dbhf approximation one evaluates the self - energy @xmath51 in a way very similar to the bhf approximation keeping track of the lorentz structure .",
    "attempts have been made to fit a density dependent relativistic mean field model ( ddrmf ) to the results of such dbhf calculations @xcite .",
    "here we employ such a ddrmf model which has been obtained by fitting density dependent coupling constants for the meson - nucleon vertices to reproduce the self - energy of the dbhf calculations of van dalen et al .",

    "this is due to the fact that the bhf approximation does not consider the propagation of particle and hole states on equal footing .",
    "an extension of the bhf approximation , which obeys this symmetry is the self - consistent green s function ( scgf ) method using the so - called @xmath68-matrix approximation . during the last years techniques have been developed , which allow to evaluate the solution of the scgf equations for microscopic nn interactions@xcite .",
    "those calculation demonstrate that for the case of realistic nn interactions , the contribution of particle - particle ladders dominates the contribution of corresponding hole - hole propagation terms .",
    "this justifies the use of the bhf approximation and a procedure , which goes beyond bhf and accounts for hole - hole terms in a perturbative way@xcite .",

    "hence the occupation probability is obtained by integrating the hole part of the spectral function @xmath83 note that this yields values for the occupation probability , which ranges between values of 0 and 1 for all momenta @xmath27 , leading to a partial depletion of the hole - states in the fermi gas model ( @xmath84 ) and partial occupations for states with momenta @xmath85 . a similar integral yields the mean energy for the distribution of the hole and particle strength , respectively @xmath86 our self - consistent green s function calculation",
    "is defined by identifying the single particle energy in the bethe - goldstone equation as well as in the @xmath87 correction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma2h1p ] ) by @xmath88 this definition leads to a single particle greens function , which is defined for each momentum @xmath27 by just one pole at @xmath89 . hence in the calculation of the self - energy the mean value of the spectral distribution",
    "is considered . however , the modified occupation of nucleons obtained by the spectral functions are not included in the calculation of the self - energies .",
    "the total energy per nucleon is evaluated by @xmath90      it is very reasonable to assume that the long - range or low - momentum part of the nn interaction is fairly well described in terms of meson - exchange , while different ( quark ) degrees of freedom are getting important to describe the short - rang or high - momentum components of the nn interaction .",
    "therefore it is quite attractive to disentangle these low - momentum and high - momentum components from each other .",
    "this means that one tries to define a model space , which accounts for the low - momentum degrees of freedom and renormalizes the effective hamiltonian for this low - momentum regime to account for the effects of the high - momentum parts , which are integrated out .",
    "this concept of a model space and effective operators appropriately renormalized for this model space has a long history in approaches to the nuclear many - body physics . as an example we mention the effort to evaluate effective operators to be used in hamiltonian diagonalization calculations of finite nuclei . for a review on this topic see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the concept of a model space for the study of infinite nuclear matter was used e.g. by kuo et al.@xcite .    during the last years",
    "this concept has received a lot of attention and led to the definition of the so - called @xmath0 interaction .",
    "one way to determine this interaction is to follow the unitary - model - operator approach ( umoa)@xcite .",
    "we follow the usual notation and define a projection operator @xmath91 , which projects onto the model space of two - nucleon wave functions with relative momenta @xmath27 smaller than a chosen cut - off @xmath92 . the operator projecting on the complement of this subspace",
    "is identified by @xmath93 and these operators satisfy the usual relations like @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "it is the aim of the unitary model operator approach ( umoa ) to define a unitary transformation @xmath98 in such a way , that the transformed hamiltonian does not couple the @xmath91 and @xmath93 space , i.e. @xmath99 the technique to determine this unitary transformation is nicely been described by fujii et al.@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it leads to an effective hamiltonian @xmath100 , which contains the term of the kinetic energy @xmath101 and an effective interaction @xmath102 given by @xmath103 diagonalising this effective hamiltonian in the low - momentum model - space , one obtains eigenvalues which are identical to the diagonalisation of the original hamiltonian @xmath104 in the complete space .",
    "this means solving the lipmann schwinger equation for nn scattering using this @xmath0 with an cut - off @xmath92 yields the same phase shifts as obtained for the realistic interaction @xmath105 without a cutoff .",
    "one finds that the resulting @xmath0 is essentially independent of the underlying realistic interaction @xmath105 , if is fitted to the experimental phase shifts and if the cut - off @xmath92 is chosen around @xmath92 = 2 @xmath106 , which means that the model space includes scattering up to the pion threshold . in that sense",
    "@xmath0 is unique and , as it reproduces the nn scattering phase shifts it can also be regarded as a realistic interaction like e.g. the cdbonn or argonne v18 interactions .",
    "since , however , the high - momentum or short - range components have been integrated out by means of the unitary transformation of eq.([eq : umoa ] ) , the @xmath0 does not induce any short - range correlations into the nuclear wave function .",
    "this leads to the nice feature that mean - field calculations using @xmath0 lead to reasonable results and corrections of many - body theories beyond mean field are weak@xcite . on the other hand , however , it is this lack of short - range correlation effects , which are modified in the medium , which prevents the emergence of a saturation point in calculations of symmetric nuclear matter@xcite .    in order to to achieve saturation in nuclear matter one has to add three - body interaction terms or a density - dependent two - nucleon interaction .",
    "this is not very astonishing as it is known that a renormalization of a two - body operator leads to many - body terms@xcite .",
    "therefore it is quite natural to supplement the effective interaction @xmath0 by a simple contact interaction , which we have chosen following the notation of the skyrme interaction to be of the form @xmath107 where @xmath17 is the matter density , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath16 are parameters . for a fixed value of @xmath16 ( typically @xmath16 = 0.5 )",
    "we have fitted @xmath108 and @xmath109 in such a way that a hartree - fock calculation using @xmath0 plus the contact term of eq.([eq : contact ] ) yields the empirical saturation point for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the same parameterization of a contact term has been used to evaluate corrections to the self - energy of bhf and scgf in such a way that also these calculations reproduce the saturation of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "note that this contact term is an isoscalar term and does not influence the symmetry energy , proton fractions in @xmath1-equilibrium , and effective masses .",
    "all results of calculations , which refer to realistic nn interactions , have been obtained using the cdbonn@xcite interaction .",
    "this includes all bhf and scgf calculations .",
    "also the evaluation of @xmath0 has been based on the proton - neutron part of cdbonn . using a cut - off parameter @xmath92 = 2 @xmath106 , these results do not significantly depend on the underlying interaction .",
    "the skyrme hartree - fock calculations have been done using the parameterization sly4 and for the relativistic mean - field calculation the parameterization for ddrmf in @xcite has been used .",
    "first let us turn to the binding energy of symmetric nuclear matter , which are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : compsymm ] . compared to other realistic nn interactions the cdbonn potential , which we have chosen here is a rather soft nn interaction with a weak tensor force .",
    "this is indicated by the results for the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter as obtained in the bhf approximation ( the minimum of the dashed black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : compsymm ] and data in table  [ table : nm_prop ] ) . the saturation density is larger than twice the empirical value and the calculated energy is well below , which means that the cdbonn result is located in the large binding energy high density part of the coester band@xcite .",
    ".[table : nm_prop ] properties of symmetric nuclear matter are compared for skyrme sly4 , ddrmf , bhf , scgf , and @xmath0 .",
    "the results , which are listed in the columns labeled with + ct are obtained employing the additional contact interaction of eq .",
    "( ) with parameters as listed in table  .",
    "the quantities listed include the saturation density @xmath2 , the binding energy at saturation @xmath110 , the compressibility modulus @xmath111 and the symmetry energy at saturation density @xmath112 . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to reproduce the empirical saturation point of symmetric nuclear we have added an isoscalar interaction term as defined in eq.([eq : contact ] ) choosing a value for @xmath16 = 0.5 and fitting the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the results for these fitting parameters are listed in table  [ table : ct_param ] and the corresponding energy versus density curves are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : compsymm ] using the same line shape and color with and without adding the contact term but add an additional symbol to the lines displaying the results with inclusion of the contact term .",
    "for all three cases the fit yields an attractive two - body contact interaction and a repulsive @xmath109 term .",
    "the results for the calculated saturation points in table  [ table : nm_prop ] are supplemented by the corresponding values for the nuclear compressibility modulus @xmath113 this nuclear compressibility , which is calculated at the saturation density @xmath2 , together with the increase of energy at large density displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : compsymm ] characterize the stiffness of the eos of symmetric nuclear matter . comparing the different approaches we find that the relativistic features included in the ddrmf approach lead to the stiffer eos around the saturation density as well as at higher densities .",
    "the scgf and the @xmath0 calculations yield rather similar results after the contact terms are included , which are a little bit softer than the ddrmf results and characterized by a compression modulus of 270 mev and 258 mev for scgf and @xmath0 , respectively . at higher densities",
    "the results are also very close to those obtained for the skyrme hartree - fock using sly4 . note , however , that sly4 yields a rather low value for @xmath111 as compared to the scgf and @xmath0 calculations .",
    "the softest eos for symmetric matter among those approaches which fit the empirical saturation point is provided by the bhf approximation .",
    "it is obvious that these results for the eos for bhf , scgf and @xmath0 are rather sensible to the choice of the exponent @xmath16 in the @xmath109 term of the contact interaction . a larger value of @xmath16 would lead to stiffer eos . we have picked the value @xmath16 = 0.5 to obtain results for the eos , which are similar to those resulting from the empirical approaches .",
    "note , that the choice of @xmath16 does not have any effect on the results referring to proton neutron asymmetries , which is the main focus of this study .",
    "table  [ table : ct_param ] also displays results for the symmetry energy @xmath114 evaluated for each approach at the corresponding saturation density @xmath2 .",
    "the two phenomenological approaches sly4 and ddrmf yield results which are in the range of the experimental value of @xmath115 mev .",
    "also the bhf and scgf approach lead to results which are rather close to the empirical value , if the contact term has been added .",
    "the bhf and scgf calculations without the contact term lead to non - realistic values for @xmath112 since these values are calculated at the corresponding saturation densities , which are larger than the empirical saturation density .",
    "the symmetry energy calculated in the scgf approach is slightly smaller than the one obtained from the bhf approximation .",
    "this is valid for all densities under consideration ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : asym ] ) .",
    "this difference can easily be explained : as we already mentioned above , the contribution of the hole - hole terms is repulsive , which leads to larger energies for scgf as compared to bhf for all densities in symmetric nuclear matter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compsymm ] ) as well as in pure neutron matter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : puren ] ) . since",
    ", however , the contribution of ladder diagrams is larger in the proton - neutron interaction ( due to the strong tensor terms in the @xmath116 partial wave ) than in the neutron - neutron interaction , this repulsive effect is stronger in symmetric nuclear matter than in neutron enriched matter .",
    "therefore the symmetry energy calculated in scgf is slightly smaller if the hole - hole terms are included in scgf@xcite .",
    "the symmetry energy at saturation density obtained from @xmath0 plus contact term is only about two third of the experimental value ( see table  [ table : nm_prop ] ) and the value is significantly below the other two microscopic approaches also at higher densities .",
    "this can be understood from the following considerations : the hartree - fock calculations using @xmath0 do not account for the attractive contributions due to the nn ladder terms involving nn states with relative momenta below the cut - off @xmath92 .",
    "this missing attraction is compensated by the fit of the contact interaction to the empirical saturation point of symmetric matter . while the contact interaction is chosen to be identical for proton - neutron and neutron - neutron interaction , the ladder terms are more attractive for the isospin @xmath117 partial waves ( see above ) , i.e. the proton - neutron interaction .",
    "this leads to a significant underestimate for the symmetry energy at all densities .",
    "note , however , that this failure of @xmath0 should disappear if @xmath0 would be employed in an appropriate many - body calculation beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "the symmetry energy rises as a function of density for all approaches considered .",
    "note , however , that the two phenomenological approaches skyrme hartree - fock using sly4 and ddrmf provide rather different predictions at high densities although the symmetry energy at normal density is identical .",
    "the relativistic approach predicts symmetry energies for high densities , which are well above all those derived from the microscopic calculations , while the skyrme interaction yields a symmetry energy which is even below the @xmath0 estimate at densities above four times saturation density .",
    "rather similar features also observed , when we inspect the properties of nuclear matter in @xmath1-equilibrium , neutralizing the charge of the protons by electrons , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : betaeq ] .",
    "the upper panel of this figure displays the proton abundance @xmath118 , which are to some extent related to the symmetry energy : large symmetry energy should correspond to large proton abundances .",
    "so the largest proton abundances are predicted within the ddrmf approach .",
    "already at a density around 0.4 @xmath3 @xmath119 exceeds the about 10% , which implies that the direct urca process could be enabled , which should be reflected in a fast cooling of a neutron star .",
    "the other extreme case is the prediction derived from sly4 . in this approach",
    "the proton abundance does not exceed a value of 6% .",
    "the @xmath0 and scgf approaches lead to similar proton abundances at large densities .",
    "this demonstrates that the evaluation of the proton abundance in @xmath1-equilibrium can not directly be deduced from the symmetry energy , since the former observable is derived from proton and neutron energies at large asymmetries ( @xmath120 ) , whereas the symmetry energy is calculated from the second derivative at @xmath121 ( see eq.([eq : symm ] ) .",
    "the bhf approach shows slightly lower values for @xmath119 at high density , but the results are still in the same range as scgf and @xmath0 .    at low densities",
    "the skyrme hf approach yields large proton fractions as compared to the results of the other calculations .",
    "large proton fractions at low densities tend to enhance density inhomogeneities and thus favor the existence of a large variety of pasta structures . therefore the skyrme hf ( sly4 ) and the ddrmf approach , which have been explored in detail in @xcite , should favor the formation of pasta structures as compared to the microscopic approaches .    comparing the energies of matter in @xmath1-equilibrium derived from the various approaches as a function of density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : betaeq],lower panel ) we find the same trends as in the case of pure neutron matter displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : puren ] . the absolute values are lower in the case @xmath1-equilibrium ( about 75% of the energies for neutron matter ) .",
    "furthermore the relative differences between the various approaches are smaller .",
    "while in the case of neutron matter the energy differences between the various predictions are as large as 50% of the mean value , the corresponding number for matter in @xmath1-equilibrium is only around 25% .",
    "the approximation schemes leading to large energies for neutron matter also show large symmetry energies , which result into relatively large proton abundances and smaller energies for matter in @xmath1-equilibrium .",
    "the equation of state of nuclear matter in @xmath1-equilibrium is the main input to predict mass and radii of neutron stars .",
    "a stiffer equation of state supports a larger maximum mass and a lower central density .",
    "in addition a thicker crust is found for the stiffer equation of state@xcite .",
    "another important information for the evaluation of dynamical features of matter in neutron stars is the density of states , which can be characterized by an effective mass .",
    "the term effective mass is used in various connections in many - body physics .",
    "this includes the effective dirac mass of the relativistic mean field approach @xmath122 ( see eq.([eq : defrels ] ) ) , as well as effective masses , which express the non - locality of the self - energy in space and time , which corresponds to a momentum and energy dependence .",
    "the density of states , however , is related to the single - particle spectrum close to the fermi energy , which in the case of nuclear matter can be parameterized in terms of an effective mass by the expression @xmath123 such effective masses for protons and neutrons determined for nuclear matter in @xmath1-equilibrium are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : effmass ] as a function of density considering non - relativistic approximation schemes .",
    "it is a general feature of all approaches considered that the effective masses for protons as well as neutrons decrease with increasing density .",
    "however , there is a striking difference between the phenomenological skyrme approximation and the bhf and @xmath0 approach , which are based on realistic nn interactions : the effective mass for protons is smaller than the corresponding one for neutrons in neutron rich matter for the calculations using realistic interactions , while it is opposite applying the skyrme parameterization .",
    "in fact , if we define the effective masses for protons @xmath124 and neutrons @xmath125 in terms of isoscalar @xmath126 and isovector masses @xmath127 by @xmath128 it turns out most of the skyrme parameterizations yield an effective isovector mass @xmath127 , which is even larger than the bare nucleon mass @xmath129@xcite , which implies that it is larger than the effective isoscalar mass @xmath126 .",
    "this means that the effective mass for neutrons is smaller than the corresponding one for the protons in neutron rich matter ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "these skyrme parameterizations leading to a large effective isovector mass are usually favored as they correspond within the mean - field approach to an enhancement factor @xmath131 of the thomas - reiche - kuhn sum - rule@xcite .",
    "attempts have been made to distinguish between effective masses , which describe the energies around the fermi energy , and those characterizing the bulk spectrum by introducing a term , which leads to a surface peaking of the effective mass term in finite nuclei@xcite .",
    "non - relativistic descriptions of nuclear matter , which are based on realistic interactions yield an effective isovector mass @xmath127 which is smaller than the corresponding effective isoscalar mass , which leads to a larger effective mass for neutrons than for protons in neutron - rich matter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : effmass ] ) . in order to analyze this finding",
    "we inspect the dependence of the nucleon self - energy in the bhf approximation @xmath132 , defined in eq.([eq : sigmabhf ] ) , as a function of energy @xmath34 and momentum @xmath27 of the nucleon considered . following the discussion of mahaux and sartor@xcite",
    "one can define the effective @xmath27-mass @xmath133^{-1}\\ ] ] and the effective @xmath134-mass @xmath135.\\ ] ] the effective mass can then be calculated from the effective @xmath27-mass and the effective @xmath134-mass by @xmath136 results for the effective @xmath27-mass and @xmath137 as obtained from bhf calculations for asymmetric nuclear matter at a density @xmath17 = 0.17 @xmath3 and a proton abundance @xmath138 of 25 % ( @xmath139 ) are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : meffscgf ] .",
    "we notice that the effective @xmath27-mass for the protons is significantly below the corresponding value for the neutrons at all momenta .",
    "since the @xmath27-masses tend to increase as a function of the nucleon momentum @xmath27 , the difference in the fermi momenta for protons and neutrons enhance the difference @xmath140 .",
    "the effective @xmath27-mass describes the non - locality of the bhf self - energy .",
    "this non - locality and thereby also these features of the effective @xmath27-mass are rather independent on the realistic interaction used .",
    "furthermore it turns out that the values for the @xmath27-mass are essentially identical if one derives them from the nucleon bhf self - energy using the @xmath31-matrix or from the bare interaction @xmath105 or from @xmath0@xcite .",
    "this non - locality of the self - energy is dominated by fock - exchange contribution originating from @xmath141-exchange . in neutron - rich matter",
    "this contribution leads to a stronger depletion for the proton mass than for the neutron mass@xcite .",
    "the effective @xmath134-mass , representing the non - locality of the self - energy in time , yield values larger than @xmath129 for momenta around @xmath142 . also in this case the deviation of @xmath143 from @xmath129 is larger for protons than for neutrons .",
    "the effective @xmath134-mass originates from the energy - dependence of the @xmath31-matrix and is due to the admixture of 2-particle 1-hole configurations to the single - particle states .",
    "one may also say that the effective @xmath134-mass is due to correlations beyond mean field .",
    "it accounts to the coupling of vibrational modes .",
    "anyway , the enhancement of the effective mass @xmath143 , which is due to the effective @xmath134-mass in eq.([eq : mstartot ] ) is not strong enough to compensate the effects of the @xmath27-mass .",
    "therefore the final effective mass is below the bare mass @xmath129 and the effective mass for neutrons remains larger than the corresponding one for protons .",
    "the effects of the @xmath134-mass are weaker for @xmath0 than for the @xmath31-matrix .",
    "this is obvious since @xmath0 only accounts for ladder diagrams included with particle - particle states above the cut - off , whereas the @xmath31-matrix includes all particle - particle states above the fermi - momenta .",
    "this explains the lower effective masses obtained for @xmath0 than for the bhf approximation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : effmass ] ) . results on effective masses obtained from scgf are rather similar to the bhf results , therefore we do not discuss them here explicitly .    we want to add that the results for the effective @xmath134-mass can be rather different in finite nuclei than in nuclear matter . as it has already been mentioned above",
    ", this @xmath134-mass is due to the admixture of vibrational modes , which are quite different in finite nuclei as compared to nuclear matter .",
    "this may explain the differences in the predictions for the effective isovector mass resulting from skyrme interactions , which are based on fits of properties for finite nuclei , and those originating from realistic interactions .",
    "finally we are going to address the results for effective masses as they originate from relativistic mean - field approximations . here",
    "we have to distinguish between the values for the dirac mass and the effective mass parameterizing the single - particle spectrum according to eq.([eq : defmas ] ) .",
    "the dirac mass @xmath122 is defined in terms of the scalar part of the self - energy ( see eq.([eq : defrels ] ) ) . in the case of the relativistic mean - field approximation",
    "the self - energies do not depend on energy or momentum and the scalar self - energies for protons and neutrons are solely due to the direct contributions of the scalar mesons @xmath53 and @xmath54 . the dirac masses obtained from ddrmf in nuclear matter at @xmath1-equilibrium are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : meffddrmf ] .",
    "we see that the dirac masses decrease with density but show larger values for the protons than for the neutrons .    in order to compare these results for the dirac mass with the corresponding non - relativistic effective mass",
    ", we have to compare the expressions for the single - particle energies eq.([eq : dirace ] ) and eq.([eq : defmas ] ) and adjust the parameters in such a way that the expressions yield identical results and slopes as a function of @xmath144 at the fermi momentum .",
    "this leads to @xmath145 where the label @xmath32 refers to the case of proton and neutron .",
    "results for these non - relativistic masses are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : meffddrmf ] by solid lines .",
    "we find that the enhancement of the dirac mass by the corresponding fermi momenta in eq.([eq : diffmas ] ) is significant for the neutrons in particular .",
    "this leads to the effect that at high densities the non - relativistic effective mass for neutrons gets larger than the corresponding mass for protons , a behavior which is opposite to the one observed for the dirac masses .",
    "it is worth noting that this feature , the difference of the dirac masses @xmath146 is negative while the difference of the corresponding non - relativistic masses is positive has been observed before within the framework of dirac brueckner hartree fock ( dbhf ) even at small densities@xcite .",
    "the parameterization of the ddrmf approach has been made to reproduce the bulk properties of the dbhf of @xcite .",
    "however , this adjustment can not account for details like the non - locality of the self - energies in dbhf .",
    "therefore it does not reproduce such details as the effective isovector mass with good accuracy .",
    "various approaches to the nuclear many - body problem have been investigated to explore their predictions for nuclear matter at high density and large proton - neutron asymmetries .",
    "two of these approaches , the skyrme hartree - fock and the density dependent relativistic mean field approach are predominantly of phenomenological origin .",
    "their parameters have been adjusted to reproduce data of finite nuclei . however",
    ", the parameters have been selected in such a way that also bulk properties of asymmetric nuclear matter derived from microscopic calculations are reproduced .",
    "the other three approaches are based on realistic nn interactions , which fit the nn scattering phase shifts . in these approximation schemes",
    "( brueckner hartree fock bhf , self - consistent greens function scgf and hartree fock using a renormalized interaction @xmath0 ) a isoscalar contact interaction has been added to reproduce the empirical saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "these various approximation schemes lead to rather similar predictions for the energy per nucleon of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter at high densities . in detail one",
    "finds that the relativistic ddrmf leads to a rather stiff equation of state ( eos ) for symmetric matter while the bhf approach leads to a relatively soft eos , a feature which is compensated within the microscopic framework by the repulsive features of the hole - hole ladders included in scgf .",
    "the phenomenological approximation schemes ddrmf ( skyrme hartree fock ) over ( under ) estimate the symmetry energy at high densities as compared to the microscopic approaches .",
    "the lack of long range ( low energy ) correlation effects in @xmath0 leads to a symmetry energy which is too small already at normal density .",
    "these features are also reflected in the study of nuclear matter in the @xmath1-equilibrium and lead to moderate differences in the predictions for proton abundances and eos .",
    "more significant differences are observed when we inspect details like the effective masses , in particular the isovector effective mass . in neutron - rich matter",
    "the microscopic approaches predict a positive difference between neutron and proton effective masses .",
    "this feature can be related to the non - locality of the self - energy induced by one - pion exchange term and is expressed in terms of an effective @xmath27-mass .",
    "this feature may partly be compensated by the effects of vibrational excitation modes on the nucleon mean fields .",
    "the effects of such low - energy excitations might lead to different results in nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "this could be study e.g. in many - body calculations employing @xmath0 , which account for the effects of vibrational modes explicitly .",
    "we also discuss the differences between effective dirac masses and corresponding non - relativistic masses in neutron - rich matter .",
    "while the difference between the neutron and proton dirac masses is negative , the differences of the corresponding non - relativistic masses tend to get positive .",
