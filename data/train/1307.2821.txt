    "the significance of this inertial effect is that it breaks the degeneracy of the jeffery orbits .",
    "if , in addition , particles are subject to a random force , the resulting orientational distribution is expected to be determined by a balance between the dispersing random forces and the aligning inertial forces .",
    "the goal of the present study is to investigate the orientational dynamics of axisymmetric particles with small inertia , to describe and quantify the attracting orbits , and to analyse their effect on the orientational distribution when noise is present .    to accomplish this goal we first derive an equation of motion for the orientation of an axisymmetric particle in steady flows in the absence of noise , valid for small values of the stokes number @xmath0 .",
