    "<S> this implies that nodes in the same structural module share similar functions , which is a belief often supported by empirical findings  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , the fully synchronized state is globally stable for a set of initial conditions having finite measure  @xcite and the transient dynamics closely reflects the structure of the graph , so that nodes belonging to the same structural module evolve similarly in time  @xcite . </S>",
