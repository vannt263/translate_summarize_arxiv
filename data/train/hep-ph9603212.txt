    "during the past six years the four experiments at lep have provided an abundance of data supporting the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics and its @xmath7 gauge group structure . until recently there has been no significant deviation pointing to new sources of physics beyond the sm . however , within the last two years there has been growing evidence that a discrepancy exists between the predicted and measured widths for the @xmath8 and @xmath9-quark decays of the @xmath2 boson . in particular , lep has reported measurements of  @xcite : .    c r_b + r_c    =    c0.22190.0017 + 0.15430.0074    .",
    "these values differ from the sm predictions , @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite ( for @xmath12@xcite and @xmath13 ) , by @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "if one is willing to accept the @xmath1 discrepancy as statistical , then there are many new sources of physics which can serve to resolve the @xmath0 measurement by only changing the couplings of the third - generation fermions . such a method is naturally provided by low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) with light charginos and stops  @xcite , or by additional fermions mixing with , or additional interactions of , the @xmath8 and @xmath16 quarks  @xcite . however ,",
    "if one interprets the @xmath1 deficit as another signal of new physics , then the scenarios for new physics are more limited  @xcite .",
    "a potential hurdle which one must face with respect to simultaneously explaining the @xmath0 excess and the @xmath1 deficit is that the lep measurement for the total hadronic width of the @xmath2 is in good agreement with the sm prediction ( @xmath17 at lep versus @xmath18 in the sm ) , while the sum @xmath19 is in slight disagreement with the sm prediction .",
    "that is , @xmath20 as measured at lep ( with the error correlations properly included ) , versus a theoretical expectation of @xmath21 , @xmath22 apart .    a clue to solving",
    "this conundrum may lie in a simple observation . defining @xmath23 as the difference between the experimental and the theoretical determinations of @xmath24 , one notes that 3_b+2_c=(-23.224.3)so that at the @xmath25 level , a consistent interpretation of the data is given by assuming a flavor - dependent but generation-_independent _ shift in the hadronic @xmath2-couplings .",
    "that is , _ u , c&=&^sm_u , c+_c + _ d , s , b&=&^sm_d , s , b+_b .",
    "[ eq : genindep ] such a pattern of shifts has also been suggested in  @xcite .",
    "a second hurdle in explaining the @xmath0 and @xmath1 puzzles is that unlike the partial hadronic widths of the @xmath2 , the well - measured partial leptonic widths are in good agreement with the sm predictions : @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which are within @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively of theory .",
    "any source of new physics must preserve the successful predictions of the sm for the leptonic widths .    in this paper",
    "we propose to explain the @xmath30 problem by introducing an additional @xmath31 gauge symmetry .",
    "if this new @xmath31 is broken near the electroweak scale , there can be significant mixing between the usual @xmath2 and the new @xmath3 .",
    "the physical @xmath2-boson as produced at lep will then have its couplings to fermions altered by an amount proportional to the @xmath32 mixing angle times the @xmath3 coupling to those same fermions .",
    "analyses have recently appeared in the literature  @xcite that seek to fit the lep data by introducing such an additional @xmath31 .",
    "both of these works make a phenomenological fit to the data introducing some number of new parameters , such as arbitrary @xmath31 charge ratios , @xmath32 mixing angle , and @xmath3 mass .",
    "these analyses do indicate that this class of scenarios has the potential to solve the @xmath30 discrepancy , and are therefore interesting .",
    "however , they share some fundamental problems associated with the lack of an underlying , consistent framework .",
    "for example , the extra @xmath31 is _ not _ anomaly free ( this is true both for the @xmath33 ^ 3 $ ] , and most seriously , the mixed sm-@xmath31 anomalies ) .",
    "further , since the authors of  @xcite also seek to explain the cdf dijet excess , they are forced to take a high value of the @xmath3 mass .",
    "for such @xmath3 masses , the @xmath31-couplings have to be so large that the @xmath31 gauge coupling becomes non - perturbative at most a decade above the @xmath3 mass scale ; implicit in this is that the @xmath3 width in these models equals or even exceeds the @xmath3 mass .    here",
    "we will take a different approach .",
    "we set forth a few basic principles which we believe any attractive @xmath3-model should obey . within this framework",
    "we will find that there exist only limited classes of @xmath31 models which are phenomenologically viable and theoretically consistent .",
    "each class has a well - defined prediction for the @xmath31 charges of the sm fermions , reducing much of the arbitrariness in the couplings .",
    "we will not attempt to explain the cdf dijet anomaly .",
    "the principles that we demand are :    * the low energy spectrum must be consistent with the unification of the _ standard model _",
    "gauge couplings that occurs in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "this will lead us to consider models which are extensions of the mssm , with any non - mssm matter added in particular combinations which can be thought of as filling complete multiplets of @xmath34 .",
    "we allow the possibility of unification within a string framework , and do not _ require _ the presence of a field theoretic gut .",
    "* all non - mssm matter must fall into vector - like representations under the sm gauge groups .",
    "such a requirement is consistent with the absence of experimental evidence for new fermions with masses below the top quark mass .",
    "further , note that additional _",
    "matter is disfavored by the electroweak precision measurements , since , in contrast to vector - like matter it can give very large contributions to the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 parameters .",
    "* the @xmath31 charges of the sm leptons must be ( to a good approximation ) zero .",
    "this requirement of _ leptophobia _ is motivated by the phenomenology .",
    "this alone will eliminate the @xmath6 factors associated with most traditional gut groups , since gut s tend to place leptons and quarks into common multiplets . *",
    "consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : genindep ] ) , we require that the @xmath31 couplings be generation - independent .",
    "this requirement is essential if tree ",
    "level hadronic flavor changing neutral current processes mediated by the @xmath31 gauge boson are to be naturally suppressed .",
    "this also has the advantage of simplicity and economy .    to be precise , the principle of unification that we will impose requires that the meeting of the sm couplings at @xmath38 is not a coincidence . for simplicity we will not explicitly consider in this article the various string models where the scale of unification is increased to the ( weak - coupling prediction of the ) string unification scale @xmath39 , such as those discussed in  @xcite , although it will be clear that the consequences for our discussion of such a modification are slight .",
    "( note that one interesting possibility that could maintain unification at @xmath38 is the strongly coupled string scenario recently proposed by witten  @xcite . )",
    "if one takes the unification of gauge couplings to imply the existence of a simple gut gauge group , then the natural candidates with extra @xmath6 s and three chiral families are @xmath40 and @xmath5 .",
    "however the single additional @xmath6 within @xmath40 is not leptophobic . in @xmath5",
    "all linear combinations of the two additional @xmath6 s orthogonal to hypercharge couple to leptons .",
    "nonetheless , we will show that by including an effect usually overlooked in the literature ( @xmath6-mixing in the kinetic terms through renormalization group flow  @xcite ) there exists a unique @xmath31 in the @xmath5 group which is compatible with the data .",
    "the @xmath5 subgroup in question is usually known in the literature as the @xmath4-model and interestingly is the unique model which results from @xmath5 wilson  line breaking directly to a rank-5 subgroup in a string context  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this case in some detail in section  [ sec : etamodel ] .",
    "finally , although we assume the mssm for the purposes of gauge coupling unification , we do not use mssm loop contributions to the @xmath41 vertex in order to explain any part of the @xmath0 anomaly .",
    "in particular we do not assume light charginos or top squarks which are the necessary ingredients for such a scenario  @xcite .",
    "we begin with a brief general discussion of @xmath32 mixing in the context of an @xmath42 model .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found , for example , in refs .",

    "must necessarily be small in order to explain the general agreement between lep results and the sm , we will throughout this paper use the approximation @xmath49 .",
    "we will also assume that the mass of the @xmath50 is large enough so that its effects at lep , either via direct production or loop effects can be ignored .",
    "therefore all new physics effects must appear through the mixing angle @xmath51 .",
