    "the direct encryption system called y-00 or @xmath0 @xcite uses coherent states to transmit encrypted information between two users , alice and bob , sharing a secret key .",
    "et al _ claimed in @xcite that the security of y-00 was completely equivalent to that of a classical non - random additive stream cipher .",
    "although we rebutted this claim in @xcite , the authors of @xcite have replied in @xcite to the effect that we did not understand the claims made in their original paper , and that our reply was irrelevant .",
    "it is in fact true that some details of our understanding of the claims in @xcite differ from the purported clarifications of the same provided in @xcite .",
    "however , setting aside questions of clarity of the claims in @xcite , we understand their claims in @xcite exactly and contend that the claimed equivalence of y-00 to a classical non - random additive stream cipher is false , thus reiterating the conclusion of @xcite .",
    "we provide arguments in this paper that conclusively demonstrate that y-00 is not equivalent to a non - random cipher .",
    "in section 2 , we briefly review the y-00 direct encryption protocol . in section 3 ,",
    "we describe the claims in @xcite and @xcite . in section 4",
    ", we review the concept of a random cipher and describe why they are more secure than non - random ones against attacks on the key , thus highlighting the added feature that y-00 provides over a non - random cipher .",
    "we then rebut the claims in @xcite and show why y-00 is not equivalent to a non - random stream cipher . in section 5",
    ", we briefly respond to the criticisms in @xcite of using y-00 with weak coherent states as a key generation system .",
    "we review the y-00 protocol , using the notations of @xcite for easy reference .    1 .",
    "alice and bob share a secret key @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   using a pseudo - random - number generator @xmath2 , e.g. , a linear feedback shift register , the seed key @xmath1 is expanded into a running key sequence @xmath3 , with each block @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   for each bit @xmath5 of a plaintext sequence @xmath6",
    ", alice transmits the coherent state @xmath7 and @xmath8\\pi$ ] .",
    "@xmath9 or @xmath10 according to whether @xmath11 is even or odd .",
    "this distribution of possible states is shown in fig .",
    "thus @xmath11 can be thought of as choosing a ` basis ' with the states representing bits @xmath12 and @xmath10 as its end points .",
    "bob , knowing @xmath11 , makes a measurement to discriminate just the two states @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the probability that bob makes an error can be made negligibly small by choosing the mean photon number @xmath15 large enough .",
    "in particular , the optimal quantum measurement @xcite for bob has error probability @xmath16    eve , not knowing @xmath11 , is faced with the problem of distinguishing the density operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 for a fixed signal energy @xmath20 , eve s optimal error probability is numerically seen to go asymptotically to @xmath21 as the number of bases @xmath22 ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the intuitive reason for this is that increasing @xmath23 more closely interleaves the states on the circle representing bit 0 and bit 1 , making them less distinguishable .",
    "therefore , at least under _ individual _ attacks on each qumode , the y-00 protocol offers any desired level of security determined by the relative values of @xmath20 and @xmath23 .",
    "one can also ask if eve can obtain the key @xmath1 under a _ known - plaintext _ attack , thus compromising the security of future data . while the complete analysis of the security of y-00 under known - plaintext analysis has not been performed",
    ", we can still make some remarks about the security that y-00 offers against an attack involving a fixed measurement ( e.g. , a heterodyne or phase measurement ) on each qumode followed by a _",
    "brute - force trial _ of remaining key candidates .",
    "indeed , a simple estimate of the noise in the phase measurement ( which performs better than the heterodyne measurement ) can be obtained by assuming that the noise moves the measured angle around the transmitted value uniformly within a standard deviation @xmath24 of the measurement noise .",
    "then , it is seen that the number of possible bases @xmath25 consistent with the known bit @xmath26 in each measurement is @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the randomization provided by the quantum noise creates a search problem for eve that would _ not _ be present if y-00 was a non - random cipher .",
    "nishioka _ et al _ claim that y-00 can be reduced to a classical non - random stream cipher under the attack that we now review . for each transmission @xmath28",
    ", eve makes a heterodyne measurement on the state and collapses the outcomes to one of @xmath29 possible values .",
    "thus , the outcome @xmath30 is obtained if the heterodyne result falls in the wedge for which the phase @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 .",
    "further , for @xmath33 representing the @xmath23 possible values of each @xmath11 , nishioka _ et al _ construct a function @xmath34 with the property that , for each @xmath28 , and the corresponding running key value @xmath11 actually used , @xmath35 with probability very close to 1 .",
    "in fact , for the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 , they calculate the probability that eq.([decryption ] ) fails to hold to be @xmath38 , which value they demonstrate to be negligible for any practical purpose .",
    "the authors of @xcite further claim that the above function @xmath39 can always be represented as the xor of two bit functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath41 depends _ only _ on the measurement result .",
    "thus , they make the claim that the equation @xmath42 holds with probability effectively equal to 1 .",
    "they then observe that a classical additive stream cipher @xcite ( which is non - random by definition ) satisfies @xmath43 where @xmath5 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are respectively the @xmath28th plaintext bit , ciphertext bit and running key bit . here",
    ", @xmath45 is obtained by using a seed key in a pseudo - random - number generator to generate a longer running key .",
    "the authors of @xcite then argue that since @xmath41 in eq.([reduction ] ) , like the @xmath44 in eq.([streamcipher ] ) , depends just on the measurement result , the validity of eq.([reduction ] ) proves that the security of y-00 is equivalent to that of a classical stream cipher .",
    "in particular , they claim that by interpreting @xmath41 as the ciphertext , y-00 is not a random cipher , i.e. , it does not satisfy eq.([random ] ) of the next section .",
    "we analyze and respond to these claims and other statements in @xcite in the following section .",
    "first of all , we review the definition of a _ random _ cipher . such a cipher is called a ` privately - randomized cipher ' in @xcite , but we will call it just a random cipher . a random cipher is defined by the two conditions : @xmath46 and @xmath47 here , @xmath48 refers to the @xmath49 symbol long ciphertext and @xmath50 and @xmath1 are the plaintext and secret key , as in section 1 .",
    "note that there is no restriction on the alphabet of @xmath48 , which may be binary , @xmath23-ary or even continuous .",
    "eq.([random ] ) implies that , for a given key , the plaintext may be mapped by the encrypter into more than one possible ciphertext .",
    "however , it is still required that the plaintext can be recovered from the ciphertext and the key , which is the meaning of eq.([decrypt ] ) . the case",
    "where eq.([decrypt ] ) holds but eq.([random ] ) does not is the usual case of a non - random cipher in standard cryptography .",
    "the advantage of a random cipher , which is briefly described in @xcite but not appreciated in @xcite , is that it may be secure against attacks on the key in the case when the attacker knows the statistics @xmath51 of the data . in the case where the @xmath5 are independent and identically distributed ,",
    "a random cipher can be constructed that provides complete information - theoretic security of the key @xcite , in the sense that @xmath52 .",
    "such security can not be obtained with nonrandom ciphers @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion on the security of random ciphers .",
    "although we do not claim such information - theoretic security for y-00 , the possibility is not ruled out .",
    "we have already commented on the added brute - force search complexity of y-00 against attacks on the key in section 2 .",
    "we now proceed to prove that the claim in @xcite that y-00 is reducible for eve to a non - random stream cipher under a heterodyne measurement is false .    to begin with , we believe that eq .",
    "( [ decryption ] ) ( eq .",
    "( 14 ) in @xcite ) is correct with the probability given by them .",
    "the content of this equation is simply that eve is able to decrypt the transmitted bit from her measurement data @xmath53 and the key @xmath1 . in other words , it merely asserts that eq.([decrypt ] ) holds for @xmath54 . as such",
    ", it does not contradict , and is even _ necessary _ , for the claim that y-00 is a random cipher for eve .",
    "in fact , we already claimed in @xcite and @xcite that such a condition holds . in this",
    "regard , note also that the statement in section 4.1 of @xcite that `` informational secure key generation is impossible when ( eq.([decryption ] ) of this paper ) holds '' is irrelevant , since direct encryption rather than key generation is being considered here .",
    "we also agree with the claim of nishioka _ et al _ that it is possible to find functions @xmath41 and @xmath40 , the former depending only of the measurement result @xmath55 , such that eq.([reduction ] ) holds , again with probability effectively equal to one .",
    "the error in @xcite is to use this equation to claim , in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ streamcipher ] ) , that y-00 is reducible to a classical stream cipher , and hence non - random .    to understand the error in their argument , note that , for eq .",
    "( [ streamcipher ] ) to represent an _ additive _ stream cipher , the @xmath44 in that equation should be a function _ only _ of the measurement result , and @xmath45 should be a function _ only _ of the running key . while the former requirement is true also for the @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ reduction ] ) , the latter is certainly _ false _ for the function @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ reduction ] ) , since it depends _ both _ on the measurement result @xmath55 and the running key @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , it can be seen that the definition of the function @xmath57 , and thus , @xmath40 depends on the sets @xmath58 and @xmath58 defined in eq .",
    "( 12 ) of @xcite .",
    "the identity of these sets in turn depends on the relative angle between the basis @xmath59 and eve s estimated basis @xmath60 thus , it is clearly the case that @xmath56 must depend both on @xmath55 and @xmath11 , a fact also revealed by the inclusion of the subscript @xmath55 by the authors of @xcite in the notation for @xmath61 .",
    "we have shown above why the representation of y-00 via eq .",
    "( [ reduction ] ) is not equivalent to an additive stream cipher .",
    "the question may be raised , however , if eq .",
    "( [ reduction ] ) reduces y-00 to any kind of nonrandom cipher whatsoever",
    ". we will show below that the answer is negative .",
    "indeed , nishioka _ et al _ emphasize that y-00 is nonrandom because @xmath62 holds , where @xmath63 .",
    "this equation follows from eq .",
    "( [ reduction ] ) and so by considering @xmath64 to be the ciphertext , the eq.([random ] ) is not satisfied , thus supposedly making y-00 nonrandom .",
    "the choice of @xmath65 as the ciphertext is supported by the statement in @xcite that `` it is a matter of preference what we should refer to as `` ciphertext '' . ''",
    "this is not true without qualification .",
    "it ignores the _ crucial _ point that the random variable that is chosen as ciphertext must be sufficient to decrypt to the corresponding @xmath50 for every value of the key",
    ". we will show below that , for y-00 , the ciphertext alphabet needs to be atleast @xmath66-ary , although larger , even continuous alphabets ( such as the possible values of phase angle in a phase measurement or the two quadrature amplitudes in a heterodyne measurement ) may be used .",
    "thus , if one wants to claim equivalence to a classical cipher ( random or non - random ) , for a particular choice of ciphertext @xmath48 , one must show that eq .",
    "( [ decrypt ] ) is satisfied using that _ same _ ciphertext @xmath48 . in the case",
    "where @xmath67 , one may readily see that eq .",
    "( [ decrypt ] ) is not satisfied , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "the reason is that , as we noted in our description above of the function @xmath40 , decrypting @xmath5 requires knowledge of certain ranges in which the angle between the basis chosen by the running key and the estimated basis @xmath69 falls . to convey this information _ for every possible _ @xmath55 , one needs at least @xmath70 bits .",
    "it follows that the single bit @xmath41 is insufficient for the purpose of decryption , and so eq .  ( [ decrypt ] ) can not be satisfied for @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , we conclude , that in the interpretation of @xmath65 as the ciphertext , decryption is not possible even if eve has the key @xmath1 . indeed , it is @xmath71 that can be regarded as a possible ciphertext , since eq .",
    "( [ decrypt ] ) is satisfied for @xmath72 .",
    "the fact that @xmath71 is a true ciphertext sufficient for decryption is implicit in the dependence on @xmath55 of the function @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ reduction ] ) .",
    "however , with this choice of ciphertext , y-00 necessarily becomes a _",
    "random _ cipher , because @xmath73  this latter fact is admitted by nishioka _",
    "et al _ in @xcite .",
    "we hope that the discussion above makes it clear that the ` reduction ' of y-00 in @xcite to a non - random cipher is false , and that in fact , no such reduction can be made under the heterodyne attack considered in @xcite .",
    "however , the representation of ciphertext by @xmath72 does reduce it to a _",
    "random _ cipher under the heterodyne attack . as a result , it can be implemented classically in principle , but not in practice .",
    "this is because true random numbers can only be generated physically , not by an algorithm , and the practical rate for such generation is many orders of magnitude below the @xmath74 gbps rate in our experiments where the coherent - state quantum noise does the randomization _ automatically_. furthermore , our physical `` analog '' scheme does not sacrifice bandwidth or data rate compared to other known randomization techniques . see @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "we conclude this section by responding to some other statements made in @xcite .",
    "in section 3,2 , nishioka _ et al _ state that `` it is interesting to note that a smaller @xmath23 ( but not @xmath23=1 ) is preferable for increasing the stochastic property . '' here , they mean that the decryption using @xmath71 and the key is noisier for smaller @xmath23 .",
    "we claim that this can not be the case and that the decryption probability is essentially independent of @xmath23 . in any case , for the heterodyne quantum noise to cover more states on the circle , it is clear that a larger @xmath23 is preferable ( see our discussion in section 2 ) .",
    "in section 3.3 , nishioka _ et al _ claim that `` the value of @xmath41 does not have to be the same as that of @xmath75 when @xmath76 , even if @xmath77 holds . ''",
    "this statement is in direct contradiction to their previous statement in the same subsection that `` @xmath41 depends only on the measurement value @xmath55 '' .    in the same subsection ,",
    "nishioka _ et al _ claim that `` in ( @xcite ) , we showed another concrete construction of @xmath41 ... '' . in our opinion",
    ", there was no explicit construction of @xmath41 in that paper , which to us seemed quite vague .",
    "we were led to the choice of @xmath44 described in @xcite by the attempt to make the additive stream cipher representation eq .",
    "( [ streamcipher ] ) valid .",
    "in fact , such a representation is claimed by nishioka _",
    "et al _ in their case 2 of @xcite .",
    "it turned out , however , that decryption using that @xmath44 suffered a @xmath78% error depending on the value of @xmath20 used .",
    "see @xcite for further details . in any case ,",
    "as we have shown above , no construction of a single - bit from the heterodyne measurement results can satisfy eq.([decrypt ] ) with the extremely low probability given in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , we replied to the claim that information - theoretically secure key generation is impossible for y-00 by showing a 6 db advantage that the users have over eve launching a heterodyne attack",
    ". this advantage can be used for practical key generation using a small enough value of @xmath20 .",
    "this is acknowledged in @xcite , thus validating our claim that it is indeed possible .",
    "however , the new issue is raised in @xcite that this advantage is too small to allow y-00 to generate keys , in their example , over a distance of 50 km . in this connection",
    ", we merely wish to state that , ( i ) this is not the original issue under dispute and we do not wish to bring a new issue into the present discussion ; ( ii ) similar loss limits are also present for bb84 ; ( iii ) other techniques and schemes are already discussed in @xcite to overcome this distance limit .",
    "we have demonstrated that , under a heterodyne measurement , the y-00 direct encryption protocol can not be reduced to a classical non - random stream cipher , as claimed in @xcite .",
    "its security under heterodyne attack is equivalent to a corresponding random cipher ."
