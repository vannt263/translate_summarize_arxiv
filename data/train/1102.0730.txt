    "modern research has to cope with an increasing difficulty mainly in two aspects : first , the number of degrees of freedom is tremendously large making it difficult to obtain a physical understanding of the above phenomena .",
    "in addition , computations are often dramatically time consuming due to a wide range of time - scales to be resolved . as a result ,",
    "methodologies able to tackle the above issues become highly desirable .",
    "the issue of physical understanding is drawing an increasing attention in the realm of kinetic modeling of biological systems with many degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "modern simplification techniques ( often referred to as _ model reduction methods _",
    "@xcite ) are based on a systematic decoupling of the fast processes from the rest of the dynamics , and are typically implemented by seeking a _ low dimensional manifold _ in the phase - space . towards this end , several methods have been suggested in the literature @xcite which are based on the following picture ( for dissipative systems with unique steady state to be addressed below ) : multiscale systems are characterized by a short transient towards a stable low - dimensional manifold in the phase space , known as the slow invariant manifold ( sim ) .",
    "the subsequent dynamics is slower and proceeds along the manifold , until a steady state is reached .",
    "recently , the relaxation redistribution method ( rrm ) has been proposed @xcite and implemented in realistic combustion mechanisms for hydrogen @xcite and methane mixtures @xcite .",
    "rrm has been introduced as a particularly efficient scheme to implement the film equation of dynamics ( see section [ background ] below ) , which can be used to construct the sim and adaptively choose the minimal description of complex multiscale systems @xcite . in the latter references ,",

    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ background ] , the problem of model reduction is introduced and the notions of both invariance equation and film equation are briefly reviewed .",
    "the governing equations of the linearized rrm are presented in section [ slow.equations ] , where the link between the presented method and other approaches ( i.e. direct solution of invariance and film equations @xcite , ildm @xcite , csp @xcite ) is shortly discussed .",

    "thus , through @xmath10 , it is possible to pick up the most likely microstate among all the possible ones which are consistent with a macrostate characterized by the _ macroscopic observables _ @xmath11 ( see also @xcite ) . in the following , by model reduction",
    ", we mainly refer to constructive methods of both the slow and fast subspaces , and we assume that an arbitrary manifold @xmath12 can be defined ( at least locally ) by means of a mapping @xmath13 by definition , @xmath14 is _ invariant _ with respect to the system ( [ odegen ] ) if inclusion @xmath15 implies that @xmath16 for all future times @xmath17 .",
    "equivalently , if the tangent space @xmath18 to @xmath12 is defined at @xmath19 , invariance requires : @xmath20    in order to transform the latter condition into an equation , it proves convenient to introduce projector operators . for",
    "any subspace @xmath18 , let a projector @xmath21 onto @xmath18 be defined with image @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "then the invariance condition can be expressed as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is often called _ defect of invariance _",
    "@xcite , and @xmath26 represents the identity matrix .",
    "it is worth stressing that , although the notion of invariance discussed above is relatively straightforward , _ slowness _ instead is much more delicate .",
    "we just notice that invariant manifolds are not necessarily suitable for model reduction ( e.g. , all semi - trajectories are , by definition , one - dimensional ( 1d ) invariant manifolds ) . for singularly perturbed systems ,",
    "the notion of slow invariant manifold has been defined in the framework of the geometric singular perturbation theory by fenichel @xcite .",
    "however , we should also point out that in general the different methodologies proposed in the literature for model reduction purposes are based on different objects .",
    "for instance , it is known that the rate controlled constrained equilibrium ( rcce ) manifold @xcite typically does not even fulfill the invariance condition ( [ inveq ] ) , whereas other methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) attempt the construction of invariant objects ( with different accuracy ) . here , we follow the rationale behind the method of invariant manifold ( mim ) @xcite , where slowness is understood as _ stability _ ( see also chapter 4 of @xcite ) , so that a sim is the _ stable stationary _ solution of a relaxation process ( _ film equation _ ) @xmath27 we notice that the projector operator @xmath21 introduces first order spatial derivatives ( with respect to the manifold parameters @xmath28 ) .",
    "therefore , ( [ inveq ] ) and ( [ film ] ) are partial differential equations ( see also @xcite ) whose unknown is the function @xmath29 , which is conveniently utilized for a parametric representation of the manifold @xmath12 , with @xmath12 being the image of @xmath29 : @xmath30 .",

    "we stress that , although the presented methodology has been tested in the case of dissipative systems with a unique steady state ( see section [ ben - ex ] ) , in this paper we show that the governing equations ( [ y.evol ] ) and ( [ a.fast.dynamical ] ) of the linearized rrm are based on the general notions of film equation ( [ film ] ) and sim ( local ) parameterization .",
    "therefore , investigations on the performance of the presented method in more general systems with multiple steady states and chaotic behavior ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) are planned for future publications . however , in the latter case , new initialization procedures are needed since the method discussed in section [ inizio ] is suitable for dissipative systems equipped with thermodynamic lyapunov function .    finally , it is worth noticing that the proposed approach represents only one possible implementation of the rrm method ( @xcite ) .",
