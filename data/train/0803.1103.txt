    "effects of anisotropy on superconducting critical temperature and energy gap become of primary importance by approaching the strong - coupling regime when transition temperature @xmath0 becomes of the order or even larger than the characteristic energy @xmath1 of a boson modes which mediate superconductivity .",
    "this issue received little attention up to now . in the weak - coupling limit , the effects of anisotropy were investigated shortly after the bardeen , cooper , schrieffer ( bcs ) theory ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "pokr , and for multiband systems refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite ) . following the paper by markovitz and kadanoff @xcite , different authors (",
    "references can be found in the review @xcite ) introduced the so - called separable interaction @xmath2where @xmath3 is an anisotropy parameter , the fermi surface averaging @xmath4 being equal to zero .",
    "the result is the enhancement of the effective coupling constant    @xmath5    and corresponding rising of the of @xmath0 according to the standard bcs expression@xmath6where @xmath7 is the phonon cut - off .    for multiband clean systems in the weak - coupling limit the effective coupling constant in eq.[tcbcs ]",
    "is determined by the _",
    "maximum eigenvalue _ of the matrix @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are band indices .",
    "_ intraband _ impurity scattering does not affect superconducting properties ( anderson s theorem ) , while the _ interband _ one averages out the order parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( and @xmath0 ) corresponds to the average value    @xmath12    ( see e.g. refs.@xcite , @xcite ) . for positively defined matrix @xmath13 the maximum eigenvalue is bigger than @xmath14 , and we have the enhancement of @xmath0 for multiband systems in comparison with the averaged value independently on the sign of the nondiagonal matrix elements which determine the anisotropic contribution @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies of superconductivity in the two - band superconductor @xmath15 @xcite and calculations of covalent metals as the hypothetical hexagonal lib and boron - doped diamond renewed the interest to the problem of an upper bound on superconducting critical temperature in strongly coupled anisotropic systems .",
    "some estimates provide values of @xmath16 in anisotropic superconductors as large as 4 ( ref.moussa ) or even 25 ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "let us first remind the result for the strong coupling approach to isotropic systems .",
    "for the case @xmath17 ( which can occur for large @xmath18 ) real phonons give the pairbreaking contributions to the superconducting pairing as well as to the quasiparticle renormalization .",
    "the largest terms corresponding to pair - breaking and quasiparticle damping ( see appendix a ) cancel each other ( @xcite ) and as the result one arrives the following strong coupling expression ( see ref.@xcite ) @xmath19where in the simplest approximation @xmath20 ( numerical calculations give @xmath21 ) .",
    "there are interpolation expressions connecting strong- and weak - coupling limits ( see reviews allenmitr , dm , carbotte ) .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite have imposed two possible upper bounds on a maximal critical temperature of multiband superconductors : the lower one is determined by the averaged coupling constant ( [ av ] ) , while the upper one is governed by the maximal ( positive ) eigenvalue of the matrix for the first momentum of the eliashberg functions @xmath22 @xmath23 _ { \\alpha \\beta } = m_{\\alpha \\beta } ( 1)=2\\int_{0}^{\\infty } d\\omega \\omega \\alpha _",

    "we show that the low frequency phonons play a role similar to _  intraband _ and _ interband _ static impurities .",
