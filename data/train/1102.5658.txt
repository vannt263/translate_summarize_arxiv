    "the visualization of a three dimensional discrete framed curve is an important and widely studied topic in computer graphics , from the association of ribbons and tubes to the determination of camera gaze directions along trajectories .",
    "potential applications range from aircraft and robot kinematics to stereo reconstruction and virtual reality @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we are interested in addressing the problem of characterizing the physical laws that govern protein folding . for this",
    "we develop a technique for framing a general discrete and piecewise linear curve in a manner that will eventually enable us to combine the geometric problem of framing with an appropriate physical principle for frame determination .",
    "our ultimate goal is to have an approach , where instead of purely geometric considerations the frames along a curve are determined directly from the properties of an underlying physical system . as a consequence",
    "we expect that our formalism and our results will find wide applicability well beyond the protein folding problem .",
    "the classical theory of continuous curves in three dimensional space employs the frenet equation @xcite , @xcite to determine a moving coordinate frame along a sufficiently differentiable space curve .",
    "however , if the curve has inflection points and/or straight segments or if it fails to be at least three times continuously differentiable , the frenet frame becomes either discontinuous or may not even exist .",
    "in such cases there can be good reasons to consider the option to introduce an alternative framing such as bishop s parallel transport frame @xcite , a geodetic reference frame or some possibly hybrid variants @xcite , @xcite .    in this article",
    "we derive a discrete version of the frenet equation that introduces a framing along an intrinsically discrete and piecewise linear curve in @xmath1 .",
    "we develop the general formalism for the visualization of such a curve without any underlying assumption that it approaches a continuous space curve in the limit where the maximum length of its line segments goes to zero .",
    "the continuum limit may as well be a fractal , with a nontrivial hausdorff dimension .",
    "thus , unlike in several approaches that we are aware of , our starting point is not in a discretization of the continuum frenet equation .",
    "instead our approach is intrinsically discrete , and it is based on the transfer matrix formalism that is widely used for example in lattice field theories @xcite . indeed , we find it useful to adapt some notions of lattice gauge theories @xcite . for us",
    "this provides a valuable conceptual point of view .",
    "moreover , since the transfer matrix formalism intrinsically incorporates self - similarity and the very concept of line segment length has no rle in our derivations , we can effortlessly consider curves that have fractal continuum limits while at the same time ensuring that if the continuum limit exists as a class @xmath2 space curve we recover the standard frenet framing together with its generalized versions .    as an application we consider folded proteins , for which the continuum limit is known to be a fractal with hausdorff dimension that is very close to three @xcite .",
    "the locations of the central @xmath3 carbon atoms along the protein determines a discrete piecewise linear curve , this is the protein backbone . we introduce a framing to the backbone by employing the @xmath0 carbon atoms of the side chain amino acids that are covalently bonded to the @xmath3 carbons that define the backbone .",
    "the frame at the location of a given @xmath3 carbon is determined by the directional vector that connects it with the ensuing @xmath0 carbon , together with the directional vector that connects it to the next @xmath3 carbon along the backbone . by inspecting the framing of all protein structures in the protein data bank ( pdb ) @xcite",
    "we find that such a @xmath0 framing relates intimately to the discrete frenet framing of the backbone .",
    "in particular , we conclude that for a folded protein the concept of an inflection point acquires an intrinsic biological interpretation , it coincides with the location of the center of the loop : the inflection points drive the protein loop geometry .    at an isolated inflection point of a continuous curve ,",
    "the curvature which is a frame _ independent _ geometric characteristic of the curve vanishes . at such a point",
    "the frenet frame can become discontinuous ( see figure 1 ) .     becomes abruptly reflected in the oscullating plane from one side to the other side of the curve .",

    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    consequently a single non - degenerate inflection point can not be removed by any local continuous deformation of the curve .",
    "an isolated non - degenerate inflection point can only be locally and continuously removed in the presence of another inflection point , by deforming the curve so that the inflection points annihilate each other in a saddle - node bifurcation . in particular a sole non - degenerate inflection point can be removed only by translating it away through an endpoint of the curve which involves a _",
    "global _ deformation of the curve .",
    "this kind of stability enjoyed by an isolated inflection point under local deformations of the curve is the hallmark of a topological soliton .",

    "it is topologically stable and can not be removed by any finite energy deformation . , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the center of the soliton is at the point @xmath10 where @xmath11 vanishes .",
    "the influence of this center point to the global topology of the trajectory can not be removed by any kind of continuous local deformation @xmath12 , as the resulting curve continues to retain its characteristic global property that @xmath13 as @xmath9 .",
    "thus the deformed @xmath11 necessarily vanishes at least at one point .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to explain how this signature behaviour of a topological soliton can be detected and described in the case of discrete piecewise linear curves , and in particular those curves that relate to the framing of folded proteins .",

    "@xcite , in the presence of inflection points the frenet equation ( [ contds1 ] ) is usually introduced only piecewise between the inflection points , for those values of @xmath28 for which @xmath29 is nonvanishing .",
    "but there are also alternative approaches that allow for a continuous passage of the frame through the inflection point ( more generally straight segments ) . for this",

    "we note that ( [ sot ] ) , ( [ sok ] ) can be interpreted in terms of a @xmath33 gauge multiplet @xcite : the change ( [ sot ] ) in @xmath48 is identical to the @xmath49 gauge transformation of a one - dimensional gauge vector while @xmath29 transforms like a component of a @xmath33 scalar doublet .",
    "this leads us to a gauge invariant quantity , the complex valued hashimoto variable @xcite @xmath50 when we combine ( [ sot ] ) with a @xmath51 rotation ( [ sok ] ) by @xmath46 around the @xmath52-direction of the @xmath38 lie algebra , the effect on ( [ hash1 ] ) can be summarized as follows , @xmath53 \\cdot \\left [ \\exp\\left(i\\int_0^{s } \\ !",

    "( note however , that the @xmath55 dependence remains as an overall global phase ambiguity which is inherent to ( [ hash2 ] ) - the local gauge invariance becomes eliminated but a global one remains . ) in fact , the hasimoto variable simply combines the two real components of the @xmath33 scalar doublet into a single complex valued variable , with modulus that equals the frame independent _ a.k.a . _ gauge invariant geometric curvature of the curve .",
    "in particular the frenet frame is like the widely used `` unitary gauge '' in the abelian higgs model @xcite .",

    "furthermore , since the inflection points are non - degenerate , as we approach an inflection point the left and right derivatives of the curvature are non - vanishing and in the limit when @xmath62 they become equal in magnitude but have an opposite sign , @xmath63 this jump in the derivative of the curvature is the signature of an inflection point in the frenet frame . but",

    "we may call this gauge transformed version of the frenet frame the @xmath71-frenet frame , its discrete version will become important to us when we consider applications to folded proteins .    for a concrete example we take the plane curve in figure 1 . for this curve , in the vicinity of the inflection point",
    "the frenet curvature has clearly a qualitative form that may be described by the absolute value of the kink - soliton profile ( [ ys ] ) , @xmath72\\right|\\ ] ] obviously the derivative of this curvature is discontinuous with a finite jump at the inflection point @xmath73 where @xmath10 .",
    "this discontinuity reflects itself in the abrupt change in the direction of the ( green ) normal vector @xmath4 , as depicted in figure 1 .",

    "the direction of the corresponding normal vector is also continuous through the inflection point .",
    "this is because the change in its direction becomes compensated by the change in the sign of the signed curvature when we cross the inflection point ; see the blue vectors in figure 1 , and figure 6 .",

    "for a practical algorithmic implementation the following choice can be convenient , @xmath237 @xmath238 @xmath239",
    "@xmath240 where we have introduced the notation @xmath241 for the segment lengths . the generalized frenet frame together with the corresponding location of the vertex @xmath242 can then be computed by iterative application of @xmath243 this can be directly generalized into @xmath244 where @xmath245 is the matrix ( [ exprd ] ) and the @xmath246 are the components of the vector @xmath247 when @xmath248 ( and @xmath249 ) we obtain the transfer matrix ( [ genet ] ) with @xmath250 the tangent vector of the curve , while for general @xmath251 the tangent of the curve is in the direction of @xmath252 in the @xmath253 frame .",
    "thus this transfer matrix provides a rule for transporting an _ a priori _ arbitrarily oriented orthogonal frame along the curve .    of particular interest",
    "is the construction of a discrete version of bishop s parallel transport frame @xcite , as a gauge transformed version of the discrete frenet frame .",
    "since the frenet frame starts with @xmath223 and can be constructed once @xmath254 are known ( unless we introduce @xmath227 which lacks a geometric interpretation ) , we assume this to be the case . the discrete version of bishop s frame is obtained by gauge transformation from the frenet frame , by demanding that @xmath255 we can freely choose @xmath256 as an initial condition , and consequently we arrive at bishop s frame by selecting @xmath257 for @xmath258 we get similarly from @xmath259 that @xmath260 and thus the discrete version of bishop s parallel transport frame is related to the discrete frenet frame by gauge transformations @xmath261 when we substitute this in ( [ exprd ] ) with ( [ thetad ] ) , we find that the transfer matrix ( [ exprd ] ) simplifies into @xmath262 where now @xmath263 and with ( [ dfe3 ] ) , we can construct the discrete version of bishop s parallel transport frame at each vertex @xmath76 .",
    "as an application we utilize the df equation to investigate the framing of the folded proteins in the protein data bank ( pdb ) @xcite .",
    "we are particularly interested in the existence and characterization of a _ preferred _ framing that derives and directly reflects the physical properties of the folded proteins .",
    "the identification of such a preferred framing , if it exists , should help to pinpoint the physical principles that determine how proteins fold .    from the pdb we get the three dimensional coordinates of all the different atoms in a folded protein .",
    "the overall fold geometry is described by the location of the central @xmath3 carbons that determine the protein backbone .",
    "we take the @xmath3 carbons to be the vertices in a discrete and piecewise linear curve that models the backbone .",
    "we then use the @xmath3 coordinates to compute the corresponding frenet framing . for this",
    "we first apply ( [ t ] ) , ( [ b ] ) , ( [ n ] ) to obtain the orthonormal basis vectors at each vertex .",
    "we then construct the transfer matrices by evaluating the bond and torsion angles from ( [ bond ] ) and ( [ tors ] ) .",
    "we start by analyzing in detail an explicit example , the chicken villin headpiece subdomain hp35 ( pdb code 1yrf @xcite ) .",
    "this is a naturally existing 35-residue protein , with three @xmath265-helices separated from each other by two loops .",
    "this protein continues to be the subject to very extensive studies both experimentally @xcite-@xcite and theoretically @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we note that the overall resolution in the experimental x - ray data in pdb is 1.07a in rmsd @xcite .",
    "we first compute the backbone frenet frame bond and torsion angles ( @xmath266 ) from the pdb coordinates of the hp35 @xmath3 carbons .",
    "the result is shown in figure 7 ( left ) .",
    "gauge transformations ( [ dsgau ] ) at the loop regions .",
    "the result clearly reveals the presence of inflection points , they are located between the sites where the ( gauge transformed ) bond angle changes its sign .",
    "this can also be used to dentify the center of the loop .",
    "note how closely the profile of the bond angle in the right hand side picture resembles that of the kink - soliton in the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ of figure 2 .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    we inquire whether the loop regions contain inflection points . as we have previously explained for example in connection of figure 6",
    ", the inflection points can be difficult to identify in terms of the bond angles of the discrete frenet framing alone .",
    "but as apparent from figure 6 , we can expect that an inflection point is located in the vicinity of vertices where the frenet frame torsion angle is subject to strong local fluctuations .",
    "thus we proceed to inspect the data in figure 7 ( left ) using the gauge transformation ( [ dsgau ] ) to scrutinize the loop regions where the frenet torsion angle in figure 7 ( left ) is strongly fluctuating .",
    "this leads us to a particular version of the @xmath71 frenet frame , with bond and torsion angles as in figure 7 ( right ) .    by comparing the bond angles in figure 7 ( right ) with the kink - soliton profile in the right hand side of figure 2",
    "we observe that the bond angles of our gauge transformed frames at each of the loops have assumed the distinctive hallmark profile of a ( discrete ) kink - soliton that interpolates between the adjacent @xmath265-helices .",
    "in particular , we can unambiguously pinpoint the centers of the loops to the locations of the inflection points on the curve : the inflection points are between the vertices where the bond angle in our gauge transformed frame changes its sign .",
    "we have performed a similar analysis to several proteins in the pdb , and some of our results where the techniques of the present article are utilized have been reported in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the results are remarkably consistent : in every secondary superstructure that we have studied where a loop connects two @xmath265-helices and/or @xmath267-strands , after appropriate @xmath71 gauge transformations the profile of the bond angles in the loop can be described with sub - angstrm accuracy in terms of a discrete version of the kink - soliton in figure 2 .",
    "the two asymptotic ground states at @xmath268 in this figure correspond to the @xmath265-helices and/or @xmath267-strands at the ends of the loop . for the @xmath265-helices we have the frenet",
    "frame values very close to @xmath269 the @xmath267 strands can also be interpreted as helices , but in the `` collapsed '' limit with the approximative values @xmath270 consequently it appears that these @xmath265-helix/@xmath267-strand - loop - @xmath265-helix/@xmath267-strand superstructures are indeed _ inflection point solitons _ with the qualitative profile of ( [ ys ] ) .",
    "we remark that a long loop may also consist of a number of inflection points _",
    "i.e. _ it can be a multi - soliton configuration .      in every amino acid except glycine",
    ", there is a @xmath0 carbon that is covalently bonded to a @xmath3 carbon .",
    "the positioning of these @xmath0 carbons in relation to their @xmath3 carbons characterizes the relative orientation of the amino acid side chains along the protein backbone , and can be used to introduce a distinctive framing of the backbone ; the case of glycine can be treated like that of an inflection point .",
    "since the interactions between different amino acids are presumed to have a pivotal rle both during the folding process and in the stabilization of the native fold , the @xmath0 framing should be a natural choice to intimately reflect the physical principles that determine the fold geometry of the backbone .",
    "consequently one way to try and understand the physical principles that determine how a protein folds , could be to investigate the @xmath0 framing along the protein backbone .",
    "here we propose that a practical approach is to look for gauge parameters ( [ discso2 ] ) that relate the @xmath0 frames to some purely geometrically determined frames such as the frenet frames or parallel transport frames .",
    "the identification of the rules that determine the relevant gauge parameters @xmath158 should then provide insight to the physical principles that underlie the protein folding phenomenon .",
    "the @xmath0 framing is constructed from the tangent vectors @xmath35 of the backbone and the unit vectors @xmath271 that point from the @xmath3 carbons towards their @xmath0 carbon .",
    "the framing is obtained by gram - schmidt algorithm , by first introducing the unit vector @xmath272 and then completing it into an orthonormal frame @xmath273 at each @xmath3 vertex , where @xmath274    in order to characterize the rules that determine the gauge parameter @xmath158 relating a @xmath0 frame to the corresponding frenet frame , we have investigated the statistical distribution of the @xmath275 vectors in the pdb proteins in the frenet framing of the backbone . for this",
    "we introduce , at each backbone vertex , the inclination angle @xmath276 $ ] between the tangent vector @xmath104 and the corresponding vector @xmath275 , together with the azimuthal angle @xmath277 $ ] between the normal vector @xmath167 and the projection of @xmath275 on the @xmath278 plane ; see figure 8 .     and @xmath279 that describe the location of the @xmath280 @xmath0 carbon with respect to the frenet frame along the @xmath3 backbone .",
    "the distance between the @xmath3 and @xmath0 carbons is within the range of 1.56 - 1.57 a. , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    0.3 cm    we first consider the @xmath0 framing of the hp35 .",
    "when we compute the directions of the individual vectors @xmath275 in the frenet frame , we get the result that we display in figure 9 .     in the frenet frame along 1yrf backbone .",
    "the blue dots are the @xmath3 carbons in the helices , and the red dots are the @xmath3 carbons that are located in the loops . , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    remarkably , the directions of the @xmath275 vectors in the frenet frame are _ relatively _ site independent .",
    "this implies that at least in the case of hp35 , the parameters @xmath158 that relate the @xmath0 frame to the frenet frame can be assigned to a high accuracy a constant and site independent value : the physically determined orthonormalized @xmath0 frame appears to differ from the purely geometrically determined frenet frame only by small nutations in the direction of the vectors @xmath271 in the frenet frame .",
    "we observe that these nutations are somewhat smaller in the helix regions that in the loops .",
    "we conclude that since the frenet framing of hp35 is determined entirely by the backbone geometry so are the orientations of the amino acids , with a surprisingly good accuracy .    in the general case",
    ", we have inspected the correlation between the @xmath0 framing and the frenet framing by performing a statistical analysis of the directional distribution of the @xmath271-vectors in the backbone frenet frames for all amino acids in pdb .",
    "our results are summarized by figure 10     carbon vectors @xmath271 for all sites of all proteins presently in pdb , with color intensity proportional to the number of vectors . for @xmath265-helices _ ( left ) _ , the direction of @xmath271 nutates very little around the direction @xmath281 . for @xmath267-strands _ ( right ) _",
    "the nutation is somewhat more spread , but still very clearly concentrated around @xmath282 .",
    "finally , for loops _ ( center ) _ we observe the formation of a narrow arc that connects the @xmath265 and @xmath267 directions .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    where we display the statistical distribution of the angles @xmath283 that we have defined in figure 8 .",
    "we have used the pdb definition to identify the three structures we display separately ( @xmath265-helix , @xmath267-strand , loop ) but we note that there are sometimes ambiguities in determining whether a particular amino acid belongs to a @xmath265-helix , @xmath267-strand or a loop in particular when the amino acid is located in the vicinity of the border between these three classes .",
    "we find that the observation we have made in the case of hp35 persists : the orientations of the @xmath0 carbons in the frenet frames are quite inert and essentially protein and amino acid independent .",
    "there is only a slight nutation around the statistical average value .",
    "furthermore , the directions for the @xmath265-helices and @xmath267-strands are also almost the same , the difference in the statistical average is surprisingly small but nevertheless noticeable . in the case of loops , we find that the statistical distribution of the vector @xmath271 in the frenet frame displays a thin band that connects the @xmath265-helices and @xmath267-strands .",
    "this universality is somewhat unexpected , since only a small proportion of the loops connect an @xmath265-helix with a @xmath267-strand .",
    "the overlapping regions between the three different classes in the kent plots of figure 10 can be at least partly explained by the uncertainty in classifying amino acids in the vicinity of the border regions .",
    "we expect that a careful scrutiny of the class assignments of these amino acids will sharpen our statistical results .",
    "alternatively , our approach could be developed into a technique to determine a more definite classification of those amino acids that are located in the border regions separating the @xmath265-helices , @xmath267-strands and the loops from each other .",
    "but even at this level of classifying the amino acids the results of our analysis imply that almost independently of the protein , when we traverse its backbone by orienting the camera gaze direction so that it remains fixed in the frenet frames , the directions of the @xmath0 carbons are subject to only small nutations .    in figure 11 we display the histograms for the components of the @xmath0 vectors @xmath275 in terms of the @xmath284 and @xmath285 angles defined in figure 8 .",
    "these histograms confirm that the directional variations of the @xmath275 are surprisingly inert .",
    "angles displayed in figure 10 . for all @xmath0 in the pdb .",
    "the histogram shows how the directions are subject to only very small deviations around their average values . ,",
    "scaledwidth=80.0% ]    finally , we have found that in bishop s parallel transport frame the direction of the @xmath0 carbon does not lead to such a regular structure formation as in the frenet frame ; see figure 12 where we plot the statistical distributions of the vectors @xmath271 in the bishop s frames .",
    "carbons are distributed in a longitudinally uniform manner inside a segment of the kent sphere .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "we have scrutinized the problem of frame determination along piecewise linear discrete curves , including those with inflection points .",
    "our approach is based on the transfer matrix method that has been previously applied extensively to investigate discrete integrable systems and lattice field theories .",
    "the introduction of a transfer matrix enables us to describe a framing in a covariant manner , with different frames related to each other by @xmath33 gauge transformations that correspond to rotations in the normal planes of the curve .",
    "in particular our construction is not based on , and does not involve , any discretization of a continuum equation . consequently we can effortlessly describe curves that become fractals in the limit where the lattice spacing _ a.k.a . _",
    "the length of line segments vanishes .",
    "but we have also verified that if the continuum limit exists as a class @xmath2 differentiable curve , we arrive at the generalized version of the continuum frenet equation .",
    "furthermore , the manifest covariance of our formalism under frame rotations enables us to investigate the framing of a physically determined discrete curve in a manner where the framing is based on , and captures the properties of the underlying physical system .",
    "consequently we expect that our formalism has wide applications to the visualization of discrete curves and the determination of camera gaze positions in a variety of scenarios .",
    "one notable outcome of our analysis is the identification of inflection points with the centers of loops , and the interpretation of loops as kink - solitons . in @xcite , @xcite we have already applied this identification to develop an ansatz based on ( [ ys ] ) , to succesfully describe the native folds of pdb proteins in terms of elementary functions .    as an example we have investigated the framing of folded proteins in the protein data bank . in this case",
    "no _ valable _ continuum description exist , due to the fact that the universality class of folded proteins is characterized by the presence of a nontrivial hausdorff dimension .",
    "consequently any framing of folded proteins should be inherently discrete . in order to introduce a framing that directly relates to the physical properties of a folded protein ,",
    "we have employed the relative orientation of the @xmath0 carbons in the amino acids with respect to the ensuing backbone central @xmath3 carbons .",
    "we have statistically analyzed the relative orientation of these @xmath0 frames to the geometrically determined frenet frames of the pdb proteins .",
    "we have found that the two framings are almost identical , they differ from each other only by a practically amino acid independent global frame rotation : for the @xmath265-helices the nutation in the orientation of the @xmath0 carbons in the frenet frame is _ very _ sharply concentrated around its statistically determined average direction . for @xmath267-strands",
    "the result is very similar , with only a relatively small increase in the amplitude of nutations .",
    "finally , in the case of loops we find that the orientation of the @xmath0 carbons oscillates along a narrow circular arc that connects the @xmath265-helices and @xmath267-carbons . in each case",
    "we have used the definition employed in the protein data bank to identify the helix / loop class of the amino acid , and we note that the existing criteria for determining this class in the case of an amino acid that is located in the vicinity of the terminals of each structure is subject to interpretations . consequently we propose that there are several border line cases that interfere destructively with the accuracy of our statistically determined results .",
    "we hope that our framing technique will eventually provide a refinement of the existing classification principles .",
    "the biophysical interpretation and biological relevance of our observations will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we thank maxim chernodub for many valuable discussions and jack quine for communications ."
