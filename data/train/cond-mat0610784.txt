    "for all life - forms on earth with the exception of certain viruses , genetic information is carried within the cellular nucleus via strands of strands of deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) .",
    "the genetic information itself is encoded in the specific sequence of the nucleic acid bases : adenine ( a ) , thymine ( t ) , guanine ( g ) , and cytidine ( c ) .",
    "dna is also a strong absorber of ultraviolet light leaving it highly susceptible to photomutagenic damage with the primary photoproducts being bipyrimidine dimers linking neighboring t bases . for all organisms ,",
    "this susceptibility is compensated for in part through enzymatic repair actions that remove damaged segments along one strand using the complementary strand as a template for replacement .",
    "such repair mechanisms are quite costly energetically . remarkably , however , dna is intrinsically photochemically stable as single bases are able to rapidly convert photoexcitation energy into thermal energy on a picosecond time scale through non - radiative electronic processes .",

    "we assume these interactions to be local since the distance at which the coulomb energy between an electron / hole pair equals the thermal energy in aqueous ionic media at 300k is on the order of the base - stacking distance .",

    "we assume that such a configuration is the result of an photoexcitation at the appropriate photon energy ( 4.87 ev for the thymidine exciton and 5.21 ev for the adenosine exciton respecitively ) and based upon the observation that the uv absorption spectra largely represents the weighted sum of the uv spectra of the constituent bases . since these are not stationary states , they evolve according to the time - dependent schrdinger equation , which we integrate using the tchebychev expansion of the time - evolution operator .",

    "[ fig2 ] we show the transient probability for finding an exciton placed on the adenosine ( left ) or thymidine ( right ) chain at time @xmath46 in some other excitonic configuration along either the adenosine or thymidine chain at some time @xmath47 later . in both cases , negligible exciton density is transferred between chains and the excitons rapidly become delocalized and scatter ballistically down the dna chain .",
    "there are some striking differences , however , between the exciton dynamics in adenosine versus those in thymidine .",
    "first , in comparing the @xmath48 matrix elements , one easily concludes that the exciton mobility along the thymidine chain is considerably greater than the mobility along the adenosine chain .",
    "this can be see in fig 2 . comparing the time required for an excitonic wavepacket to reach the end of either chain . in adenosine",
    ", the exciton travels nearly 5 base pairs in about 25 fs where as an exciton along the thymidine chain covers the same distance in about 10 fs .",
    "this factor of two difference in the exciton velocity is commensurate with the @xmath491:2 ratio of the @xmath50 intrachain excitonic couplings .",
    "secondly , we note that the adenosine exciton remains qualitatively more `` cohesive '' than the thymidine exciton showing a number of ballistic traverses up and down the adenosine chain over the 300 fs we performed the calculation .",
    "one can also note that the exciton velocity in the 5-3 direction is slightly greater than in the 3-5 direction as evidenced by the exciton rebounds off site @xmath51 slightly sooner than it rebounds from site @xmath52 .",
    "this is due to the asymmetry introduced in by the @xmath53 and @xmath54 terms .",
    "all in all , one can clearly note a series of strong recurrences for finding the adenosine exciton on the original site @xmath44 every 100 fs .",
    "the thymidine exciton dynamics are far more complex as the exciton rapidly breaks apart .",
    "while few recursions can be noted , however , after the first ballistic traverse , the thymidine exciton no longer exists as a cohesive wavepacket and is more or less uniformly distributed along the thymidine side of the chain .",
    "the excitonic dynamics only tell part of story . in the lower frames of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the net charge taken as the difference between the hole density and electron density on a given base . in the case where the initial exciton is on the adenosine chain ,",
    "very little charge - separation occurs over the time scale of our calculation . on the other hand , when the exciton is placed on the thymidine chain , the exciton almost _ immediately _ evolves into a linear combination of excitonic and charge - separated configurations .",
    "what is also striking is that in neither case do either the electron or hole transfer over to the other chain even though energetically charge - separated states with the electron on the thymidine and the hole on the adenosine sides of the chain are the lowest energy states of our model .",
    "@xcite it is possible , that by including dissipation or decoherence into our dynamics , such relaxation will occur , however , on a time scale dictated by cross - chain transfer terms . for the coupling terms at hand ,",
    "electron or hole transfer across base pairs occurs on the time scale of 3 - 4 ps .",
    "the difference between the excitonic dynamics following excitation of a vs. t can be quantitatively noted by comparing the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where we compare the projection of the time - evolved state onto the excitonic configurations of the chain on which the exciton was placed ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) compared to the projection onto the excitonic configurations of the other chain ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) . for the case",
    "in which the adenosine chain was excited , approximately 75% of the total probability density remains as excitonic configurations along the adenosine chain .",
    "in stark contrast , only about 40% of the initial thymidine exciton remains excitonic along the thymidine side of the chain .",
    "the reason for the remarkable difference between the two chains stems from the difference in electron and hole mobility along the thymidine chain . indeed , comparing the electron and hole hopping terms given above , @xmath59 for the thymidine chain compared to @xmath60 for along the adenosine chain",
    "this is manifest in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where we see almost immediately a negative charge remaining for a few fs on the site where the initial excitation was placed .",
    "in contrast , no charge - separation is seen following excitation along the adenosine side of the chain .",
    "a proper model of the electronic dynamics in dna must include some contribution from the solvent and environment . for dna in water at 300k , we assume that the electronic processes described in our model are fast compared to the structural and environmental fluctuations the dna lattice itself such that the parameters for the b - dna structure represent the average values for the system in aqueous media .",
    "for example , the characteristic time scale for the relative lateral and longitudinal motions of bases in dna is 10 to 100 fs with amplitudes of 0.01 to 0.1 nm .",
    "@xcite since electronic interactions between bases are sensitive to the fluctuations in the geometry of the dna structure .",
    "factors such as salt concentration and other solvent media will have profound impact on the structure and hence on the model parameters .    since short strands of dna are fairly rigid , the electronic coupling terms are likely most sensitive to the upon the dihedral angle , @xmath61 between adjacent bases . if we take the fluctuations in @xmath61 to be @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the reduced moment of inertia of the at base - pair and @xmath64 is the torsional frequency .",
    "this gives an rms angular fluctuation of about 5% about the avg .",
    "@xmath65 helical angle .",
    "since this is a small angular deviation , we take the fluctuations in the electronic terms to be proportional to @xmath66 and sample these terms from normal distributions about b - dna average values .     except averaging over ensemble of configurations.,title=\"fig : \" ]   except averaging over ensemble of configurations.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the effect of disorder on the excitonic dynamics are seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . as in case of the homogeneous lattice",
    "above , our initial state is a frenkel exciton on thymidine # 5 .",
    "the right - hand plot of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the probability of finding the time - evolved state in various excitonic configurations .",
    "while the time - scale for the exciton break up is slower than in the homogenous lattice , one can deduce that even with static off - diagonal disorder , the thymidine exciton is subject to dissociate to charge - transfer ( i.e. polaron ) pairs on an ultrafast timescale .",
    "the adenosine exciton appears to be more profoundly affected by the lattice disorder with some population transfered to the thymidine chain .",
    "since the total exciton population is lowered upon introducing disorder , the remaining excited state population exists as charge - separated pairs .",
    "analysis of the transient excited state wavepackets ( not - shown ) indicates a small but significant fraction of @xmath67 interstrand charge - transfer configurations .",
    "lastly , we examine the relative mobilities of the electron and hole by calculating the r.m.s .",
    "width of the electron and hole densities on either chain following excitation , the results of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in the top two plots",
    "are the r.m.s .",
    "widths for the homogeneous lattice following excitation .",
    "as discussed above , the hole is considerably more mobile than the electron along the thymidine side of the chain .",
    "this is very much evidenced by the more rapid spread of the hole density compared to the the electron density . likewise , along the adenosine side , the conduction and valence bands have nearly identical band - widths and the electron and hole densities evolve very much in concert .",
    "this scenario is preserved upon even averaging over configurations indicating that to within a 5% error in our parameter set or the to within the typical thermal fluctuations of a dna chain , our predicted dynamics are quite robust .",
    "the results described herein paint a similar picture to that described by recent ultrafast spectroscopic investigations of ( da).(dt ) oligomers in that the initial excitonic dynamics is dominated by base - stacking type interactions rather than by inter - base couplings .",
    "interchain transfer is multiple orders of magnitude slower than the intrachain transport of both geminate electron / hole pairs as excitons and independent charge - separated species . indeed , for an exciton placed on the adenosine chain",
    ", our model predicts that exciton remains as a largely cohesive and geminate electron / hole pair wave function as it scatters along the adenosine side of the chain .",
    "our model also highlights how the difference between the mobilities in the conduction and valence bands localized along each chain impact the excitonic dynamics by facilitating the break up of the thymidine exciton into separate mobile charge - carriers . in the actual physical system",
    ", the mobility of the free electron and hole along the chain will certainly be dressed by the polarization of the medium and reorganization of the lattice such that the coherent transport depicted here will be replaced by incoherent hopping between bases .",
    "the significance of the breakup of the exciton is twofold .",
    "first , it is well recognized that photoexcitation of adjacent stacked pyrimidine bases leads to the formation of _ cis - syn _ cyclobutane pyrimidine - dimer lesions .",
    "however , this dimerization occurs only in the triplet ( rather than singlet ) excited state .",
    "@xcite consequently , spin - flip must occur _ ether _ via spin - orbit coupling or via recombination of polaron pairs.@xcite if we assume that the spins are decorrelated at some intermediate distance @xmath68 where the coulomb energy is equal to the thermal energy , photoexcitation of a thymine sequence could rapidly result in a population of triplet excitons formed by exciton dissociation followed by geminate recombination .",
    "secondly , the process is reversible and triplet reactivation of the dimer can lead to repair of the lesion .",
    "isolating the photoexcitation to the originally excited chain minimizes the potential mutagenenic damage to the dna sequence since it preserves the complementary chain as an undamaged back - up copy of the genetic information .",
    "it is fascinating to speculate whether or not the isolation of a photoexcitation and its photoproducts to the original chain was an early evolutionary selection criteria for the eventual emergence of dna as the carrier of genetic information .    in conclusion , we present herein a rather compelling model for the short - time dynamics of the excited states in dna chains that incorporates both charge - transfer and excitonic transfer .",
    "it is certainly not a complete model and parametric refinements are warranted before quantitative predictions can be established . for certain ,",
    "there are various potentially important contributions we have left out : disorder in the system , the fluctuations and vibrations of the lattice , polarization of the media , dissipation , quantum decoherence .",
    "we hope that this work serves as a starting point for including these physical interactions into a more comprehensive description of this system .",
