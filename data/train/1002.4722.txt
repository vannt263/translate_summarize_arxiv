    "knots ( see @xcite for further information ) are embeddings of the circle into @xmath0-space modulo deformation of the embedding . the classification of knots modulo deformations is still an open problem .",

    "this mathematical object constitutes a _ knot invariant _ in the sense that if different objects are assigned to diagrams @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then the knots they stem from are not deformable into each other .",
    "we now elaborate on fox colorings since they give rise to the the knot invariant we are concerned with in this article , the minimum number of colors .",
    "given an integer @xmath3 and a knot diagram , @xmath4 , of a given knot @xmath5 , a ( fox ) @xmath6-coloring of @xmath4 ( @xcite ) is an assignment of integers mod @xmath6 ( i.e. , numbers from @xmath7 mod @xmath6 ) such that , at each crossing of @xmath4 , the equality `` twice the color on the over - arc equals the sum of the colors on the under - arcs '' holds ( mod @xmath6 ) .",
    "the fox @xmath6-colorings can be alternatively envisaged as follows .",
    "assign a variable to each arc of @xmath4 and at each crossing read off the equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the variable assigned to the over - arc and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the variables assigned to the under - arcs ( figure [ fig : cross ] ) .",
    "a system of linear homogeneous equations is thus associated to each knot diagram .",
    "the solutions of this system of equations mod @xmath6 constitute the @xmath6-colorings of @xmath4 .",

    ", the matrix of the coefficients of the linear homogeneous system of equations undergoes _ elementary transformations _ as described in @xcite on page @xmath16 . in this way , the equivalence class of the matrix of the coefficients modulo elementary transformations is a knot invariant and so is any minor of this matrix .",
    "the first minor of this matrix is called the determinant of the knot @xmath5 , @xmath17 .",
    "the topic of minimum number of colors was set forth in @xcite where the kauffman - harary conjecture was presented .",

    "the torus knots of type @xmath23 , the @xmath24 s , were investigated .",

    "furthermore , a sequence of transformations on the standard diagrams of the @xmath24 s were defined that further decreased the number of colors in infinitely many cases .",
    "the present article is a sequel to @xcite . as a matter of fact",

    "more generally , we have , @xmath386 in particular , @xmath387 implies @xmath388 , which contradicts the definition of @xmath332 .    thus @xmath389 and @xmath390 .",
    "we note that @xmath391 induces a non - trivial @xmath18-coloring on @xmath81 , since , by definition , @xmath392 .",
    "then , @xmath393 .    arguing as above in the odd @xmath55 case , we obtain : @xmath348&= \\left [ \\begin{matrix } 3 & -1\\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{matrix } \\right]^{k } \\left [ \\begin{matrix } x_{1}+1\\\\ x_{0}+1 \\end{matrix } \\right]+\\left [ \\begin{matrix } -1\\\\ -1 \\end{matrix } \\right]= \\left [ \\begin{matrix } u_{2k+1 } & -u_{2k-1}\\\\ u_{2k-1 } & -u_{2k-3 } \\end{matrix } \\right ]",

    "assume @xmath60 and consider the sequence @xmath400 .",
    "we have , @xmath401 and @xmath402 , then there are equal terms in two s .",

    "thus , this sequence contributes with @xmath405 distinct terms .",
    "now for the sequence @xmath406 .",
    "reasoning as in the preceding case , this sequence has at most , @xmath407 .",
    "so , in this @xmath60 instance , the number of distinct colors is at most @xmath408 where the @xmath409 stems from the fact that @xmath410 and @xmath409 appear on both the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 sequences ( see figure [ fig : psipeven ] ) .",

    "given the arrangement of the arcs in these standard diagrams , this implies that the @xmath415 ( see figure [ fig : psipeveneven ] ) . using the coloring condition at the crossings and the recurrence relation @xmath416",
    ", we obtain the other colors in figure [ fig : psipeveneven ] , which tell us that there are two colors in @xmath411 that already showed up in the @xmath10 sequence : @xmath95 and @xmath417 .",

    "now , for the sequence @xmath419 .",
    "again , we have an even number of terms , @xmath420 , equal in two s .",
    "since @xmath421 , which has already been accounted for in the @xmath10 sequence , then we will consider only @xmath422 pairs of terms .",
    "moreover , there is again a phenomenon analogous to the one depicted in figure [ fig : psipeveneven ] , induced by the fact that there are two equal consecutive terms in the @xmath419 sequence .",
    "this time is just the @xmath95 that has to be considered .",
    "moreover , we will now prove that this @xmath95 is distinct from the @xmath95 occurring in connection with the sequence @xmath411 . if they were equal , since the next term in both subsequences , @xmath423 and @xmath424 , is @xmath417 ( mod @xmath18 ) , then , given the recurrence relation @xmath425 , then the subsequences would be equal .",

    "the total number of colors is at most @xmath426 .    finally , the total number of colors in this @xmath62 instance is at most ( recall that @xmath409 shows up on both sides ) : @xmath427    this concludes the proof for the @xmath332 even case , concluding the proof of proposition [ prop : pmidup ] .",
