    "modern polymer physics is based on the notion that while real polymers can be arbitrarily complicated objects , their universal features are captured by a minimal model in which polymers are described as continuous random walks . while this approach has been enormously successful and led to numerous triumphs such as the understanding of rubber elasticity@xcite , the solution of the excluded volume problem and the theory of semi ",

    "such `` local details '' can be treated by polymer chemistry type models ( e.g. , rotational isomer state model@xcite ) .",
    "however , chemically ",
    "detailed approaches become prohibitively difficult ( at least as far as analytical modeling is concerned ) in the case of complex biomolecules such as dna , proteins and their assemblies and a new type of minimal models is needed to model recent mechanical experiments on such systems@xcite .",
    "such an alternative approach is to model polymers in the way one usually thinks of them , i.e. , as continuous elastic strings or filaments which can be arbitrarily deformed and twisted .",

    "we use this energy to construct the statistical weights of the different configurations and show that the deviations of the generalized torsions behave as gaussian random noises , whose amplitudes are inversely proportional to the bare persistence lengths that characterize the rigidity associated with the different deformation modes .",
    "we then derive the differential equations for the orientational correlation functions that can be expressed as averages of a rotation matrix which generates the rotation of the triad vectors as one moves along the contour of the filament .",
    "an expression for the persistence length in terms of one of the correlators is derived . in section [ iii ]",
    "we apply the general formalism to helical filaments and derive exact expressions for the correlators ( see appendix a ) and for the effective persistence length of an untwisted helix .",
    "we show that the persistence length is , in general a non  monotonic function of the amplitudes of thermal fluctuations .",
    "we also show that in the weak fluctuation regime , our exact expressions for the correlators can be derived from a simplified long  wavelength description of the helix , which is equivalent to the incompressible rod  like chain model @xcite , and that the fluctuation spectrum is dominated by the goldstone modes of this rod  like chain .",

    "note that the persistence length is a non  monotonic function of the amplitude of thermal fluctuations ( i.e. , of @xmath251 ) : it first slowly increases and eventually decreases rapidly with decreasing @xmath252 several two  dimensional plots of the persistence length as a function of the rate of twist , for different combinations of the bare persistence lengths @xmath50 are shown in fig .",
    "the detailed behavior of the persistence length depends sensitively on the choice of the parameters : for example , in the limit of weak fluctuations three maxima are observed in fig .",
    "4 , instead of a maximum accompanied by two minima in fig .",
    "3 . in all cases ,",
    "the locations of the extrema are determined by geometry only : @xmath246 , @xmath253 .    in order to demonstrate how the initial choice of the handedness of the helix breaks the symmetry between the effects of under and over  twist on the persistence length , in fig .",
    "5 we present a three  dimensional plot of the persistence length as a function of the dimensionless rate of twist @xmath254 and of the inverse radius of curvature @xmath100 , for helices with radius to pitch ratios of order unity and large asymmetry of the cross  section , @xmath255 . note that for @xmath256 ( rod  like helices ) , there is a single broad maximum at @xmath257 .",
    "then , at @xmath258 a central peak appears at @xmath246 .",
    "this peak grows much faster than the @xmath259 peak , with increasing @xmath260 at yet higher values of @xmath143 another peak appears at @xmath214 @xmath261 and eventually the amplitudes of the two mbius side ",
    "peaks become equal ( and much smaller than the amplitude of the @xmath214=@xmath262 peak ) in the limit of plate  like helices , @xmath263 ( see curve 1 in fig .",
    "4 ) .    what is the origin of the mbius resonances observed in figs .",
    "35 ? recall that the calculation of the persistence length of a twisted helix involves the solution of linear differential equations with periodic coefficients ( eqs .",
    "( [ dgi ] ) in appendix b ) .",
    "these equations were derived from linear differential equations with periodic coefficients and multiplicative random noise , eqs .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ fre1 ] ) , which are known to lead to stochastic resonances@xcite .",
    "some physical intuition can be derived from the following argument .",
    "while the persistence length is a property of the space curve described by the frenet triad , the microscopic brownian motion of the filament arises as the result of random forces that act on its cross  section and therefore are given in the frame associated with the principal axes of the filament . since the two frames are related by a rotation of the cross ",
    "section by an angle @xmath264 , the random force in the frenet frame is modulated by linear combinations of @xmath265 and @xmath266 .",
    "this gives a deterministic contribution to the persistence length which , to lowest order in the force , is proportional to the mean square amplitude of the random force and therefore varies sinusoidally with @xmath267 .",
    "the mbius resonances occur whenever the total curvature of the helix @xmath268 coincides with the rate of variation of this deterministic contribution of the random force , @xmath269 .",
    "in this work we studied the statistical mechanics of thermally fluctuating elastic filaments with arbitrary spontaneous curvature and twist .",
    "we constructed the equations for the orientational correlation functions and for the persistence length of such filaments .",
    "we would like to stress that our theory describes arbitrarily large deviations of a long filament from its equilibrium shape ; the only limitation is that fluctuations are small on microscopic length scales , of the order of the thickness of the filament .",
    "furthermore , since the equilibrium shape and the fluctuations of the filaments are completely described by the set of spontaneous torsions @xmath44 and its fluctuations @xmath270 respectively , our theory is set up in the language of intrinsic geometry of the space curves .",
    "all the interesting statistical information is contained in the correlators of the triad vectors @xmath271 which can be expressed in terms of the known correlators of the fluctuations @xmath272 , using the frenet equations .",
    "since these equations describe pure rotation of the triad vectors , this has the advantage that fluctuations of the torsions introduce only random rotations of the vectors of the triad , and preserve their unit norm .",
    "the use of intrinsic geometry automatically ensures that the inextensibility constraint is not violated in the process of thermal fluctuations and therefore does not even have to be considered explicitly in our approach .",
    "we would like to remind the readers that the formidable mathematical difficulties associated with attempts to introduce this constraint , have hindered the development of persistent chain type models in the past and led to the introduction of the mean spherical approximation in which the constraint is enforced only on the average , and to perturbative expansions about the straight rod limit .",
    "the general formalism was then applied to helical filaments both with and without twist of the cross  section about the centerline . in the latter case we found that weak thermal fluctuations are dominated by long wavelength goldstone modes that correspond to bending and twist of the coarse  grained filament ( the rod  like chain ) .",
    "such fluctuations distort the helix on length scales much larger than its natural period but do not affect its local structure and , in particular , do not change the angle of twist of the cross  section about the centerline .",
    "strong thermal fluctuations lead to melting of the helix , accompanied by complete loss of local helical structure .",
    "depending on the parameters of the helix , the persistence length is a non  monotonic function of the strength of thermal fluctuations , and may first increase and then decrease as the amplitude of fluctuations is increased .",
    "resonant peaks and dips in plots of the persistence length versus the spontaneous rate of twist are observed both for small twist rates and for rates equal to half the total curvature of the helix , phenomena which bear some formal similarity to stochastic resonances .",
    "there are several possible directions in which the present work can be extended .",
    "we did not consider here the effects of excluded volume and other non  elastic interactions , on the statistical properties of fluctuating filaments .",
    "such an analysis requires the introduction of a field theoretical description of the filaments@xcite .",
    "while this approach is interesting in its own right , we expect that the excluded volume exponent for the scaling of the end  to ",
    "end distance of a single filament will be identical to that of a gaussian polymer chain ( self  avoiding random walk )",
    ". however , new effects related to liquid crystalline ordering are expected in dense phases of such filaments .",
    "another possible extension of the model relates to the elasticity of random heteropolymers , with quenched distribution of elastic constants and/or spontaneous torsions@xcite .",
    "a  natural application of our theory involves the modeling of mechanical properties and conformational statistics of chiral biomolecules such as dna and rna .",
    "the advantage of our theory is that it allows us to take into account , in an exact manner , the effects of thermal fluctuations on the persistence length and other elastic parameters of the filament .",
    "thus , the generalization of the theory to include the effect of tensile forces and torques applied to the ends of the filament , is expected to lead to new predictions for mechanical stretching experiments in the intermediate deformation regime , for tensile forces that affect the global but not the local ( on length scales @xmath273 @xmath91 ) conformation of the filament .",
    "measurements of the effect of elongation on thermal fluctuations of the molecule , can give information about its elastic constants , and help resolve long  standing questions regarding the natural curvature of dna@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare our expression for the persistence length to that introduced by trifonov et al.@xcite who proposed that the apparent persistence length @xmath274 of dna depends not only on the rigidity ( dynamic persistence length @xmath275 ) , but also on the intrinsic curvature of the  molecule  ( static persistence length @xmath276 ) .",
    "the apparent persistence length is given in terms of the two others as @xmath277 note that the philosophy of the above approach is very similar to ours  we begin with filaments which have some given intrinsic length ( spontaneous radius of curvature / torsion ) , and find that the interplay between this length and thermal fluctuations gives rise to a persistence length @xmath91 .",
    "in fact , taking for simplicity the case of a circular cross  section , @xmath278 , our expression eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) , can be recast into the form of eq .",
    "( [ trif ] ) , with @xmath279 indeed , in our model , @xmath148 is the bare persistence length that determines the length scale on which the filament is deformed by thermal bending and torsion fluctuations .",
    "our analog of the static persistence length @xmath276 depends on the spontaneous bending rate @xmath100 and diverges in the case of a straight filament ( @xmath146 ) , in which case @xmath280 .",
    "if we make the further assumption that twist rigidity is much smaller than the bending rigidity , @xmath281 , the static persistence length becomes independent of the bending rigidity and depends on both the spontaneous curvature and the twist rigidity .",
    "note , however , that the resulting @xmath282 dependence of @xmath276 differs from the originally proposed one ( @xmath283)@xcite@xmath284    another possible application of our theory involves a new way of looking into the protein folding problem .",
    "usually , one assumes that the folded conformation of proteins is determined by the interactions between the constituent amino  acids .",
    "a different approach , more closely related to the present work , would be to reverse the common logic : instead of trying to understand what kind of spatial structure will result for a given primary sequence of amino  acids , one can begin with a known equilibrium shape ( native state ) and attempt to identify the parameters of an effective filament ( distributions of spontaneous torsions @xmath285 ) which will give rise to this three ",
    "dimensional structure@xcite .",
    "knowledge about the fluctuations and the melting of proteins can then be used to determine the distribution of the bare persistence lengths @xmath286 . while the question of whether such an approach can be successfully implemented in order to determine the relation between primary sequence and ternary structure remains open , our insights about the statistical properties of fluctuating filaments are clearly applicable to modeling of @xmath287helices and other elements ( e.g. , @xmath288sheets ) of secondary structure of proteins .",
