    "<S> thus we have measured the intrinsic third moment of voltage fluctuations of a tunnel junction in the presence of a matched vacuum , i.e. connected to a semi - infinite coax cable of the same impedance . </S>",
    "<S> it appears to have a singular property : the amplitude of the fluctuating voltage , as given by @xmath92 , is a continuous function of the bias voltage , both at zero and finite frequency . </S>",
    "<S> however , its third order correlator @xmath60 is discontinuous at zero temperature and @xmath93 ( the width of this jump is set by the measurement bandwidth @xmath94ghz and the temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> it also means that as soon as photons of frequency @xmath0 are emitted , even with an infinitesimal flux , the electromagnetic field experiences an abrupt change , measured by the third moment . </S>",
    "<S> again , a clear theoretical explanation is called for to understand this result .    _ conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> _ mesoscopic physics has started with the study of electron transport in quantum devices @xcite , followed by that of the noise ( i.e. , photons ) generated by such devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our experiment provides the first observation of the correlation between them , i.e. between the electron transport at low frequency and the photon field at high frequency , both when photons are emitted ( @xmath95 ) and when the electromagnetic field is solely due to vacuum fluctuations . in terms of the electrons only , our observations indicate that the intrinsic current fluctuations in a tunnel junction are given by @xmath83 , regardless of the frequency . thus the high frequency quantum current fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> are indeed correlated with their low frequency , classical counterpart . in terms of photons </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that the electromagnetic field exhibits a discontinuity at @xmath84 that shows up in a third order correlator and not in the second order ones .    </S>",
