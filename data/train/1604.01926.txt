    "thermal characteristics of solar flare plasma employing the multi - wavelength observations is of immense interest as it can shed light on the ongoing coupling processes in solar atmosphere . in particular ,",
    "x - ray emission during a flare is the best probe of various thermal and non - thermal energy release processes ( @xcite ) .",
    "generally , flare plasma parameters viz .",
    "temperature ( @xmath0 ) , emission measure ( @xmath3 ) , etc . are derived by forward - fitting / inversion of the observed x - ray spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the spectroscopic inversion of x - ray emission is an ill - posed problem , leading to substantial uncertainties in the derived @xmath0 and @xmath3 values ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , several different @xmath1 inversion techniques , with various functional dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath0 viz .",

    "this numerical method employs maximum likelihood approach in which a @xmath4 distribution and hence corresponding theoretical spectrum is derived in an iterative manner with the aim to minimize its difference with the input observed spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "coronal abundances are adopted from chianti atomic database ( @xcite ) while deriving the shape of theoretical spectra . as an input to this method",
    ", we have used fluxes recorded in the 73 energy bins ( corresponding to the energy band 1.6 - 5.0 kev ) and 35 energy bins ( corresponding to the energy band 5.0 - 8.0 kev ) by sphinx and soxs instruments , respectively .",

    "[ sphinx - soxs - dem ] , it may be noted that the best - fit @xmath4 relation derived from sphinx observation suggests nearly isothermal nature of the @xmath1 , with the peak at temperature ( @xmath5)@xmath6 13 mk .",
