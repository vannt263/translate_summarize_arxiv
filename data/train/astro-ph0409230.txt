    "the search for extra - solar planets with the elodie echelle spectrograph ( @xcite ) mounted on the 193cm telescope at observatoire de haute - provence ( ohp ) started in 1994 .",

    "these confirmed planetary companions are also listed in table  [ table1 ] .",

    "the total number of grid points is 3534 .",
    "we have generated 5000 random orbits for each grid point using the following distributions :    * uniform distribution for @xmath10 ( instant of periastron passage ) and @xmath11 ( longitude of the periastron ) * @xmath12 ( orbital eccentricity ) : we have used the eccentricity distribution observed for the known extra - solar planet candidates * @xmath13 ( inclination of the orbital plane ) : the probability density we have used for @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath14    our simulation algorithm accounts for :    * the stellar content of our sample ( i.e. the @xmath15 , @xmath5 , @xmath16 , @xmath17fe / h@xmath18 $ ] and @xmath6 distributions for our sample ) * the real timing of the radial - velocity observations * weather and seeing conditions at ohp * the presence of non - photonic error sources such as stellar activity jitter ( see sect  [ jitter ] )      in order to account for the presence of non - photonic velocity error sources , we have determined the distribution of the observed velocity dispersion corrected for the photon noise for a subsample of target stars .",
    "this subsample contains the non - variable stars and the micro - variable stars for which the variability origin is unknown .",
    "the stars with planetary companions , the spectroscopic binaries ( sb1 or sb2 ) , the stars with close visual companions and the stars with blended spectra have been removed .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the distributions of the velocity dispersion for the remaining targets ( 240 stars ) .",
    "their velocity dispersions have been quadratically corrected for their mean photon noise for building the displayed distributions .",
    "the remaining velocity dispersion sources present in these distributions are : the instrumental error , the stellar jitter , the stellar oscillations , the non - detected ( or not yet characterized ) light planets and the non - detected blended spectra .",
    "non - photonic error contributions have been randomly generated in our simulations using these two distributions .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the impact of the @xmath16 colour index , the metallicity @xmath17fe / h@xmath18 $ ] and the projected rotational velocity @xmath6 on the 90% detection limit obtained using the measurement dates and signal - to - noise ratios obtained for one of our sample stars .",
    "the photon noise errors have been computed using cross - correlation function parameters corresponding to the simulated stellar characteristics .",
    "the impact of rotation is negligible up to @xmath6 = 4kms@xmath4 , the value we have used for selecting our sample of slow rotators .",
    "the impact of metallicity is very weak whereas the impact of colour is higher but mostly due to primary mass differences .",
    "the absence of metallicity impact on the detection limits further demonstrates that the observed difference between the metallicity distributions for stars with and without planets ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) does not result from an observational bias .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the 50 and 90% typical detection limits for the elodie survey .",
    "the dotted curve is the 90% detection limit we would obtain without the presence of any non - photonic error source but the instrumental error ( here set to 6.5ms@xmath4 ) .",
    "the filled dots are the planet detected around stars in our sample .",
    "open triangles are used for planets detected with elodie outside our sample and for planets confirmed with elodie .",
    "the main trend of these curves is proportional to @xmath19 as expected from kepler s laws .",
    "we note the enormous sensitivity decrease at @xmath1=1 and 2days and 1 and 2years .",
    "probabilities of detection versus orbital period for different secondary masses ( 1m@xmath20 , 1m@xmath9 and 10m@xmath9 ) are displayed in fig .",
    "the presence of non - photonic error sources is taken into account .",
    "90% of the jupiter - mass planets are detected up to @xmath1@xmath320d and 50% up to @xmath1= 300d .",
    "the probability of detection for brown - dwarf companions is above 90% for all the period interval .",
    "the daily and yearly features are also clearly visible here .",
    "the dotted curves are obtained without including the contribution of non - photonic error sources except for the 6.5ms@xmath4 instrumental error .",
    "these curves clearly show the dramatic impact of stellar jitter ( and other error sources ) on the detection sensitivity .",
    "we find no sensitivity decrease between 1 and 2 days .",
    "thus , planets in this period range , the so - called `` very hot jupiters '' ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , would be easily detected if present around our sample stars .",
    "following our obtained elodie detection limits , we can correct our effective detections for all the observational biases .",
    "we can also derive , by inverting the detection probability map , the fraction @xmath21 of stars in our sample hosting at least one giant planet ( the outer planets of the two systems are not considered here ) with @xmath0@xmath220.47m@xmath9 and for different period intervals .",
    "we find :      we acknowledge support from the swiss national research found ( fns ) , the geneva university and the french cnrs .",
    "we are grateful to the observatoire de haute - provence for the generous time allocation and for the constant support during the last ten years ."
