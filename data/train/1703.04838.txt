    "two extremes of 5 g wireless system designs are pursuing very high data rate , i.e. enhanced mobile broadband ( embb ) , and enabling ultra - reliable low - latency communication ( urllc ) with very low data rate @xcite .",
    "this paper explores a missing piece between them , _ ultra - reliable ubiquitous - rate communication _ ( ur2c ) , answering to the question how much data rate can stably be achieved everywhere .",
    "for example , the ngmn alliance suggests that a rate of at least @xmath4 mbps should be supported practically everywhere @xcite . in this paper `` practically '' means that a randomly picked user equipment ( ue ) can ubiquitously attain a predefined data rate with @xmath5% reliability , which is higher than the commonly considered @xmath6% reliability of the wireless coverage @xcite .",
    "an important enabler of ur2c is ultra - dense base station ( bs ) deployment where bs / ue density ratio _ per communication resource _",

    "it makes interfering bss located farther away , yielding @xmath2 improvement .",
    "this motivated us to reconsider the problem of _ frequency reuse_. in a downlink scenario , we fine - tune frequency reuse to make it applicable for a randomly selected ue , i.e. a _",
    "typical ue_. thereby we aim at proposing an optimal frequency reuse scheme that achieves our target ultra - reliability , @xmath3 @xmath2 coverage . to this end , we suggest two frequency reuse techniques : _ bs - specific _ frequency reuse ( @xmath1 ) and _ user - specific _ frequency reuse ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "when the entire frequency bandwidth is divided into @xmath10 number of channels , each bs in @xmath1 uses only a single channel that it selects randomly ( see fig .",

    "both @xmath1 and @xmath0 introduce loss in the data rate as they are only partially using the bandwidth .",

    "its derivation follows in part from preceding works that provide closed - form downlink @xmath2 coverage at a typical ue in a form of a hypergeometric function @xcite .",
