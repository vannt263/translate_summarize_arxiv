    "the study of the properties of hadrons continues to attract significant interest in the process of revealing and understanding the essential mechanisms of qcd , the fundamental theory of the strong interactions .",
    "the non - perturbative properties of qcd and the difficulty of numerically simulating the theory at the light quark masses of nature has provided a rich history of phenomenological models at both the quark and hadronic levels and an intense study of the quark - mass dependence of hadronic observables in effective field theory ( eft ) .    based on the observation that _ all _ hadron properties show a slow , smooth variation with quark mass for pion masses above @xmath0 gev , one can conclude that the nonanalytic contributions from pion loops are suppressed there  @xcite .",
    "an alternative regularization method , namely finite - range - regularization ( frr ) , resums the chiral expansion in a manner that suppresses loop contributions at large pion masses . inspired by quark models @xcite that account for the finite - size of the nucleon as the source of the pion cloud",
    ", frr eft has been used to describe lattice data over a wide range of pion masses .",
    "frr eft was first applied in the extrapolation of the nucleon mass and magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "the remarkably improved convergence properties of the frr expansion mean that lattice data at large pion masses can be described very well and the nucleon mass obtained at the physical pion mass compared favorably with the experimental value .",
    "later , the frr method was applied to extrapolate the vector meson mass , magnetic moments , magnetic form factors , strange form factors , charge radii , first moments of gpds , etc .",
    "the results are reasonable and reflect the manner in which frr eft characterizes the essential features of qcd at the hadronic level .    the prevalence of the quenched approximation in the history of lattice qcd simulations provided an opportunity to explore the possible connection between quenched and full qcd data .",
    "indeed quenched chiral perturbation theory was developed @xcite to understand how the nonanalytic structure of quenched qcd differed from that of full qcd .",
    "it was the advent of frr eft that made it possible to define a pion - cloud contribution to hadronic observables and then proceed to correct the quenched cloud to that of full qcd  @xcite .",
    "the meson loop contributions are calculated in both quenched and full qcd in terms of the axial coupling constants .",
    "one then fits the quenched frr eft to lattice qcd to learn the low energy coefficients .",
    "this is done by fitting the coefficients of the residual series of terms analytic in the quark mass . with the assumption that the su(3 ) axial coupling constants , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , do not differ significantly between quenched and full qcd",
    ", one can replace the quenched meson cloud contribution of frr eft with the full qcd cloud contribution .",
    "we note that in dimensional regularization for example , the low - energy coefficients are composed of both residual series and loop contributions with no recourse to separating the origin of terms contributing to the total renormalised coefficient . on the contrary , in frr the low energy coefficients of the residual analytic expansion provide the core contribution which is considered invariant in moving from quenched qcd to full qcd .    quenched and partially - quenched frr chiral eft has been used to study baryon electromagnetic phenomena including charge radii , strange magnetic moments and strange form factors @xcite . in the previous calculations ,",
    "only the leading - order diagrams were included and unquenched .",
    "for example , power counting with @xmath3 for the magnetic form factor , only the leading nonanalytic terms proportional to @xmath4 and @xmath5 were included . in this paper",
    ", we will include the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) contributions .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
