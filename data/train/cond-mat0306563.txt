    "after the creation and realization of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in an alkali atomic trapped bose gas , a new field , namely strongly correlated atomic system , has been opened up @xcite .",

    "one way to perturb the system is by applying external rotation to the system .",
    "the rotation of a macroscopic quantum fluid exhibits interesting counter - intuitive phenomena .",
    "for example , an atomic interacting(repulsive ) bec confined in a rotating harmonic trap produces quantized vortices for a sufficiently large rotation @xcite . the theoretical calculation for critical rotation frequency ( @xmath0 ) based on purely thermodynamic arguments",
    "@xcite is significantly smaller than the observed value of @xmath1 . for sufficiently high stirring frequencies of the trap",
    ", the system deforms spontaneously @xcite to lower the energy barrier which prevents the nucleation of vortices at smaller @xmath2 @xcite and this spontaneous deformation is detected at the ens experiment which leads to the vortex nucleation @xcite .",
    "in fact , vortices are nucleated when the stirring potential with low anisotropies resonantly excites the quadrupole mode of the condensate , and induces large amplitudes oscillations of the condensate , resulting in a dynamical instability @xcite .",
    "the harmonically trapped bec becomes singular when the rotation frequency is equal to or greater than the harmonic trap frequency , because the outward centrifugal force counteracts the inward force from the harmonic trap .",
    "we can eliminate the singularity at @xmath3 if we consider an additional stiffer radial potential ( say , quartic potential for simplicity ) .",
    "there is a growing interest about the effect of an anharmonic potential on the properties of a rotating bec @xcite .",
    "recently , the quadratic - plus - quartic potential has been achieved experimentally at ens by superimposing a blue detuned laser beam to the magnetic harmonic trap @xcite .    in spite of the fact that the @xmath0 in a harmonically trapped bec calculated from the thermodynamic arguments does not match with the experimental values ,",
    "many authors have studied @xmath0 in a bec confined in harmonic - plus - quartic trap based on the thermodynamic arguments @xcite . in this work",
    ", we argue that a vortex formation is possible in an attractive as well as non - interacting bose gas confined in a quadratic - plus - quartic potential and calculate the critical rotational frequencies based on the spontaneous shape deformation of rotating bose gas .",

    "note that authors in ref.@xcite showed that the vortex formation in a rotating attractive bec in harmonic trap is prohibited due to the fact that all the angular momentum is carried by the center of mass motion .",
    "our analysis also shows why there is no vortex formation in an attractive bec in harmonic trap .",
    "one can do the same analysis for @xmath86 , but the deformation is not enough to transfer unit quantum of angular momentum to each particle .",
    "in this section we will discuss the effect of the quartic potential on the possibility of a vortex formation in a harmonically trapped bec . using the three coupled equations ( [ c1 ] ) , ( [ c2 ] ) and ( [ c3 ] ) , we get the following two coupled polynomial equations :    [ c11 ] 0 & = & ( _ 10 ^ 3 _ 10 ^ 3 + 2 _ 10 ^ 4 _ 10 ^ 2 + _ 10 ^ 5 _ 10)(1 + ) + & - & _ 10 ^ 3 _ 10 ( 3 ^2 + 1 + ) + ( _ 10 _ 10 ^ 3 + 2 _ 10 ^ 2 _ 10 ^ 2)(^2 - 1 - ) + & - & ( 5 _ 10 ^ 2 _ 10 + 7 _ 10 _ 10 ^ 2 + _ 10 + 3 _ 10 ^ 3 ) and [ c22 ] 0 & = & ( _ 10 ^ 3 _ 10 ^ 3 + 2 _ 10 ^ 2 _ 10 ^ 4 + _ 10 _ 10 ^ 5)(1 + ) + & - & _ 10 _ 10 ^ 3 ( 3 ^2 + 1 + ) + ( _ 10 ^ 3 _ 10 + 2 _ 10 ^ 2 _ 10 ^ 2)(^2 - 1 - ) + & - & ( 5 _ 10 _ 10 ^ 2 + 7 _ 10 ^ 2 _ 10 + 3 _ 10 ^ 3 + _ 10 ^ 3 ) . to show that there is a circular symmetry breaking of a bec confined in a quadratic - plus - quartic potential , we put @xmath13 and consider large @xmath66 ( say @xmath104 ) and solve those two coupled equations .",

    "when @xmath112 , each particle gets an unit angular momentum , i.e. @xmath113 . the vortex formation can occur for @xmath114 as well as @xmath115 , depending on the parameter @xmath63 and @xmath5 . for @xmath72 ,",

    "we have seen that the spontaneous deformation takes place due to the two - body interaction . but here spontaneous shape deformation exists in an ideal bose system confined in a quadratic - plus - quartic potential .",
    "the average angular momentum per particle is always zero when @xmath121 to @xmath122 , but @xmath123 at @xmath124 .",
    "we give another example for @xmath125 .",
    "for this anharmonic strength , the system will starts deforming when @xmath126 and the vortex will form when @xmath46 at @xmath127 .",
    "it shows that as we increase the strength of the anharmonic term , the critical rotational frequency is also increasing .",
    "note that the vortex formation occurs only when @xmath128 because @xmath81 is always greater than 1 .",
    "the variation of @xmath82 vs. @xmath80 for non - interacting bec is shown in the fig.3 .",
    "it is worth to point out that the shape deformation can even occur in the non - interacting bose gas if it is confined in a quadratic - plus - quartic potential .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that harmonically trapped attractive bec can not hold a vortex .",
    "this is because of the absence of the shape deformation in the rotating system .",
    "now we will see what happens if we add the quartic potential in hamiltonian .",
    "once we add the quartic potential , we can access a large rotation frequency ( @xmath129 ) for which the rotating attractive system is not destabilized .",
    "we assume @xmath130 and @xmath131 and then we get @xmath132 for the symmetric trap . by solving the equations ( [ c11 ] ) and ( [ c22 ] ) , we see that the spontaneous shape deformation starts when @xmath133 and transferring an angular momentum to the system .",

    "we get three real and positive solution of @xmath79 when @xmath138 .",
    "but the existence of the three solutions of @xmath82 does not mean that the system will starts deforming itself .",
    "actually , the lowest energy state can be obtained only for @xmath139 .",
    "it means there is no shape deformation for these parameters and hence a vortex can not appear under this conditions . in this attractive system ,",
    "the shape deformation can occur which leads to the vortex nucleation , depending on the strengths of the two - body interaction and the quartic potential .",
    "when there is no shape deformation for a given large @xmath66 and @xmath140 , the center of mass motion is excited @xcite .",
    "these results are also consistent with the recent results of lundh _ et al",
    ". _ @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath141 is always greater than 1 , so that deformation takes place only when @xmath128 .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the quadrupole mode frequency .",
    "we have shown that when the rotating frequency of an interacting bec confined in the quadratic - plus - quartic potential is greater than one - half of the quadrupole mode frequency , the system itself starts deforming from a circular shape to an elliptic shape and hence it breaks the rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "we have shown how this self - deformation transfer an angular momentum to the rotating system and consequently creates a vortex .",
    "we have argued that the formation of the vortex is not possible due to the absence of the spontaneous shape deformation of a harmonically trapped rotating attractive bec as well as an ideal bec .",
    "but the shape deformation and consequently the vortex formation can occur in a rotating attractive bec if it is confined by an additional quartic potential . we have also shown that the shape deformation occurs not only due to the two - body repulsive interaction , it can occur even in the non - interacting as well as attractive bec if it is confined in a quadratic - plus - quartic potential and consequently it produces a vortex . however , the shape deformation and consequently forming a quantized vortex in a rotating attractive bec depends on the strengths of the two - body interaction and the quartic potential .    note",
    "that , in actual experiments the lowest energy surface mode is excited through the rotating potential with small anisotropies . in this work we have studied ( for simplicity ) the vortex formation in a symmetrically trapped bec , but we can easily extend our work with small anisotropy @xmath142 ."
