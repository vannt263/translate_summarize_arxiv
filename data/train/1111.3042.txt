    "in the last years the polyakov - loop - extended nambu  jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model  @xcite@xcite was widely used in the study of thermodynamics and the phase diagram of hot and dense matter .",
    "results of this research are expected to play an important role in our understanding of the evolution of the early universe and physics of heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies .",
    "this improved field theoretical model is fundamental for interpreting the lattice qcd data and extrapolating into regions not yet accessible for lattice simulations .",
    "an attractive property of the pnjl model is the synthesis of the polyakov loop dynamics with the nambu  jona - lasinio model , combining the two principal nonperturbative features of low - energy qcd : confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "a particular feature of this model is that one can uniquely determine the coupling between the chiral condensate , which is an order parameter of the chiral phase transition when @xmath30 , and the polyakov loop , which is the order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "the model is remarkably successful in reproducing lattice data on the qcd thermodynamics  @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , the choice of the parameter set as well as regularization of integrals , as noted by several authors , is a nontrivial question . as it is well known , the order of the phase transition in the @xmath2 plane is sensitive to the parameter choice .",
    "it was already noted  @xcite that one can choose different sets of parameters which allow for a first order phase transition , giving a reasonable fit to physics observables in the vacuum but predicting different physical scenarios at finite temperature @xmath5 and chemical potential @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , recently new lattice data for the pure gluon qcd sector defining the effective polyakov loop potential have been obtained  @xcite which differ noticeably from the old data  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how the input information from lattice qcd and the used forms of the effective potential influence general properties of thermodynamics at finite temperature @xmath5 and baryon chemical potential @xmath6 .",
    "after introduction , in sect .",
    "2 we consider the polynomial and logarithmic parameterizations of the polyakov loop effective potential for the new and old pure gluon lattice data within the two - flavor pnjl model .",

    "consideration of different thermodynamic observables like pressure and energy density , their @xmath5 and @xmath6 behavior as well as the quark number density serves as an important probe of the model .",
    "we found that in spite of a noticeable disagreement between the old and new original lattice data , the effective gluon potentials @xmath115 are quite close to each other and a larger difference is due to the form of their approximation : the logarithmic form predicts a more distinct and narrower minimum at high @xmath5 .",
    "the model qualitatively reproduces both @xmath75 and @xmath76 meson properties in hot , dense quark matter and the rich and complicated phase structure of this medium providing information on the order of phase transitions and the position of critical points .",
    "this information depends stronger on the form of the effective potential rather than on the used lattice data set .    unfortunately , the position of the calculated cep in the @xmath2 plane is still far from the predictions of lattice qcd and empirical analysis .",
    "further elaboration of the presented model is needed .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of entanglement interactions between quark and gauge degrees of freedom in addition to the covariant derivative in the original pnjl model  @xcite and the incorporation of explicit diquark degrees of freedom  @xcite are of great interest . both modifications  @xcite reproduce lattice data at @xmath143 better than the original pnjl model and influence the position and the nature of the critical endpoint in the @xmath2 phase diagram . moreover , with the use of the logarithmic form of the effective potential , these models result in the appearance of new phases .    one should note that we are restricted to the case without diquark correlations and thus possible color superconducting phases at low @xmath5 and high @xmath6 are ignored . it is attractive also to include into consideration the color superconducting phases and nonlocality of the interaction  @xcite as well as effects beyond the meanfield  @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the effects of using different sets of data and different forms of the potential on thermodynamic properties of hot and dense matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the pnjl thermodynamics depends stronger on the form of the effective potential than on the used lattice data set . </S>",
    "<S> particular attention is paid to the phase diagram in the @xmath2 plane . </S>"
