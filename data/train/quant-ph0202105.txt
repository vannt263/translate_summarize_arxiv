    "in this article a study is made of the nature of the decay of unstable states in a nonrelativistic setting .",
    "one would expect this decay always to be exponential after some time , like the radioactive decay one finds in nature .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to demonstrate in a simple model with a ground state that next to a possible nondecaying bound state contribution there will be a non - exponential contribution to the decay pattern which will ultimately dominate the exponential decay . in practice",
    "this non - exponential contribution is extremely small and under normal conditions undetectable .",
    "moreover it will arise only when one is able to keep a state coherent for a long time , which is not the case normally .",
    "this phenomenon is not unknown and is discussed in general terms in the literature , but a model demonstration may be helpful for its understanding .    starting point is a simplified model giving rise to exact exponential decay .",
    "this will be worked out in section 2 . in section 3",
    "the model is modified as to make it more realistic .",
    "this modified model nevertheless leads to a superposition of exponential decay contributions of which one will ultimately dominate .",
    "both models have an essential flaw which is caused by the fact that no absolute lower limit to the energy has been imposed .",
    "if an energy lower limit is taken into account then a non - exponential term appears to be unavoidable .",
    "section 4 gives a discussion of this effect .",
    "consider a free hamiltonian @xmath0 , a set of kets @xmath1 and a particular ket @xmath2 with the properties : @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5    here @xmath6 is the density of free energy - eigenstates , assumed to be independent of @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , there is an interaction hamiltonian @xmath8 with the properties : h|e = a|a , h|a = a _",
    "-^ |ede    here we take @xmath9 to be real , positive and independent of @xmath7 .",
    "we have : a|h|e = e|h|a = a    this is the transition matrix element .",
    "let the total hamiltonian @xmath10 be defined as : h = h_0+h we are interested in expressions of the form : a|e^-h|a    these are transition matrix elements for the transition of a state at time @xmath11 to the same state at time @xmath12 . traditionally , one reasons as follows : up to time @xmath11 the total hamiltonian is @xmath13 which allows an experimenter to prepare a system in a pure energy eigenstate @xmath2 .",
    "then , at time @xmath11 the `` perturbation '' @xmath14 is `` switched on '' and at a later time @xmath15 `` switched off '' . from that time on one can carry out an analysis of the resulting state , in particular one can try to find out what the chances are that the original state is found back . according to heisenbergs uncertainty principle for time and energy it takes an infinite amount of time to prepare the original state and to analyse the final results , but",
    "the available time to do so is indeed unlimited .",
    "the method of time dependent perturbation theory leads then to the famous `` golden rule '' of fermi .    in order to evaluate these matrix elements we put @xmath10 in its spectral form : h= _ -^||dh|=||=(-",

    "-^(e-).(e-)de=(- )    everything taken together :    thus we find : and so we can make the following choice : c_= so that : f_(e)=[a p+(e- ) ]    finally we find the following exact expression : |=[_-^a p|ede+|-|a ]    the spectral representation of @xmath10 becomes :    this immediately leads to the following expression :    from this it follows that : a|e^-h|a=_-^d    this integral can be evaluated by contour integration .",
    "we have already assumed @xmath12 , therefore , by closing the contour with a semicircle at infinity in the lower half plane we find :    thus we find : a|e^-h|a = e^-(-ia^2 )    in the course of time the probability of finding the original state back is equal to : w_a(t)=|a|e^-h|a|^2=e^-t    this is the exponential law of radioactive decay .",
    "note that the coefficient of @xmath18 in the exponent is in agreement with fermi s golden rule .",
    "except for the simplified model specifications no approximation is made .",
    "striking is that for _ negative _ @xmath15 the same integral over @xmath19 generates a plus sign in the exponent , so that time symmetry is restored .",
    "there is apparently no question of time irreversibility .",
    "a simple kink in the time curve appears ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "in section 2 we assumed @xmath6 and @xmath9 to be independent of e. we now introduce e - dependence .",
    "we then have : h_0|e = e|e , h_0|a=|a,-0 and h|e = a(e)|a , h|a=_-^(e)a(e)|ede    again we define : |=_-^f_(e)|ede+c_|a    and try to solve the eigenvalue equation : ( h-)|=(h_0+h-)|=0 with the normalization condition : |=_-^f_^*(e)f_(e)de+c_^*c_=(- )    this now gives :    this leads to : ( e-)f_(e)+(e)a(e)c_=0 and ( -)c_+_-^a(e)f_(e)de=0    so we find : f_(e)=-(e)a(e)c_p+(e- ) and -c__-^(e ) a^2(e)pde+a()=-(- ) c _    now the integral is not zero .",

    "if @xmath9 is small also @xmath25 is small and a good approximation can be obtained by writing :    note that this is again in agreement with fermi s golden rule .",
    "let us now consider the exact integral expression . by making use of theorems on hilbert transforms",
    "we can get insight into the analytical properties of the integrand .",
    "the relevant theorems are proven in the appendix and sound :    \\1 .",
    "if @xmath26 is the hilbert transform of @xmath27 : ( y)=_-^(x)pdx then @xmath28 is the hilbert transform of @xmath29 : ( y)=-_-^(x)pdx    \\2 . the function : ( z)_-^dx    is zero in the lower half @xmath30-plane , analytic and regular in the upper half @xmath30-plane and has the property : _",

    "the function : ( x , y)=_-^(z)ppdz    satisfies the property : ( x , y)=+(x)(x - y )    the latter theorem has been used before and will be used later on .",

    "then @xmath34 is replaced by @xmath43 .",
    "we then have to solve the equation : --()=0    when @xmath44 approaches zero one of the roots approaches @xmath45 .",
    "then in first approximation we have : --()=0 and we find : _ 0 -()=-    this is what we have seen before .",
    "since @xmath46 this zero lies in the lower half plane and since this root never becomes real for any value of @xmath44 it stays in the lower half plane for all values of @xmath44 .",
    "the other roots approach poles in @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath47 be such a pole .",
    "then , near @xmath47 , we have : ( )    and we find : _ 0+    since @xmath39 is regular in the upper half plane , for sufficiently small @xmath44 these roots are all located in the lower half plane and since the roots are never real for any value of @xmath44 they remain in the lower half plane for all values of @xmath44 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath38 is regular in the lower half plane , so for sufficiently small @xmath44 there can not be solutions of the equation : --^*()=0    located in the lower half plane .",
    "now when we let @xmath44 move from infinitesimal to regular values zero s will not move in and can not spontaneously be created so for any @xmath44 there will be no solutions of the equation in the lower half plane .",
    "for @xmath48 the conclusion is that : _",
    "-^=0 and we find : a|e^-h|a=_-^    let @xmath49 be a root .",
    "then @xmath50 and its contribution to the integral is : -e^-_0    we end up with the following expression for @xmath12 : a|e^-h|a=__0__0e^-_0e^-|_0| where the @xmath51 satisfy the necessary but not sufficient condition : _ _ 0__0=1    the result is a sum of exponentials decreasing with time .",
    "one of them ultimately will dominate .",
    "note that the time derivative of w_a(t)=|a|e^-h|a|^2    in the limit @xmath52 is not zero .",
    "still there is time reversal symmetry .",
    "therefore again a kink appears at @xmath11 and the time derivative at @xmath11 does not exist .",
    "without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath53 is the lowest energy value of the free hamiltonian @xmath13 .",
    "in that case we have , with @xmath45 assumed @xmath54 : h_0|e = e|e , h_0|a=|a,0<e < e|e=(e - e),e|a = a|e=0,a|a=1 _ 0^(e)|ee|de+|aa|=i , > 0 and h|e = a(e)|a , h|a=_0^(e)a(e)|ede    as before we consider normalized eigenkets of the hamiltonian @xmath55 .",
    "we put @xmath10 in its spectral form : h=_-^||dh|=||=(- ) _",
    "-^||d = i    note here that we do not assume a lower bound on the eigenvalues .",
    "we now write : |=_0^f_(e)|ede+c_|a    the eigenvalue equation gives : from which it follows that : ( e-)f_(e)+(e)a(e)c_=0    and ( -)c_+_0^a(e)f_(e)de=0    this gives , as before : f_(e)=-(e)a(e)c_p+(e- )    when @xmath56 we obtain an equation for @xmath57:-c__0^(e)pde+a()=-(-)c _ which can be solved : = c _    in that case we have : f_(e)=-c_[(e)a(e)p+(e- ) ] where :     and is therefore the hilbert transform of the function @xmath58 .",
    "we define : |(e)=(e)(e )    we get the following expression for the eigenkets of h :    we evaluate :    here we have :    again the remaining terms can immediately be evaluated and the result becomes :    for @xmath59 .",
    "this allows the normalization constant to be determined except for a phase .",
    "we choose : c_==    note the difference with the former expression .",
    "moreover it is only valid for @xmath56 .",
    "finally we obtain for positive @xmath19 :    and so we get : a|=    when @xmath60 it is not possible to solve for @xmath57 because then @xmath61 is always zero . in that case",
    "we have : f_(e)=-c _    when this is inserted we obtain : _ 0^de=_0^de=-    which gives : --|()=0    this is an equation for @xmath19 to be solved .",
    "we have for @xmath60 that the integral and all its derivatives are positive so for any @xmath45 with the property : 0    the following expression results if there is a bound state :    the second term on the right hand side oscillates forever .",
    "that means that when one prepares the state @xmath62 this state may contain a contribution from a bound state which does not decay . the first term can be rewritten in the form : [ _ 0 ^ -_0^ ]    since the integrands have a possible pole on the negative real axis , extension of the integration path to minus infinity is not immediately possible .",
    "we have to avoid this pole and we do that by choosing the path of integration for the first integral as shown in figure  2 .    if the same integration path were chosen for the second integral the extension of the integration path to minus infinity would not have changed the results , because the integrands are equal . however , then the second integral would not be zero .",
    "this integral is only zero when the integration path be chosen as in figure  3 .",
    "the difference is just the contribution from the bound state pole and thus we find that : a|e^-h|a=    with the path of integration taken along the entire real axis except for the bound state pole and which is passed through the upper half plane , i.e. the contour is that of figure 2 .",
    "the integrand is analytic and regular in the upper half plane ( on this particular riemann sheet ) except for the pole on the negative real axis .",
    "the right hand side of this expression causes trouble because the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 are definitely nonanalytic in the lower half plane and a contour integration in the way used above is not possible .",
    "suppose that @xmath37 be analytic and regular except for poles ; @xmath65 and finite for @xmath56 ; @xmath66 finite .",
    "then @xmath67 is `` analytic '' in the sense that it has a branch cut which on both sides of the real axis stretches itself out towards infinity and passes through the origin .",
    "the cut separates two analytic functions , one of them being identically zero , the other being @xmath37 . by using a similar argument as before one can",
    "now easily prove that @xmath68 is still regular in the upper half plane and that its analytic continuation is regular in the lower half plane except for poles and a branch cut starting at the origin .",
    "now the point @xmath69 is necessarily a true branch point .",
    "we take the cut along the negative imaginary axis . except for the bound state pole all poles",
    "are on the right hand side of the cut and in the lower half plane .    in order to evaluate the integral we deform the contour as to wrap the cut :",
    "the right hand side is rotated clockwise and the left hand side anticlockwise towards the negative imaginary axis . in the mean",
    "time poles are passed which give exponential contributions to the integral .",
    "the problem now is to evaluate the remaining contour integral . in figure",
    "4 the branch cut , possible poles and the original integration path are drawn .",
    "note how the branch point is evaded .",
    "after deformation of the contour the situation is as sketched in figure  5 .",
    "let @xmath70 be the final contour .",
    "the poles on the right hand side of the imaginary axis give damped oscillatory contributions , the pole on the left hand side gives a pure oscillatory contribution from the bound state .",
    "the remaining contour integral is :    where @xmath71 is the `` jump across the cut '' of the function :    the integral is apparently a linear combination of an infinite number of decaying exponentials .",
    "the function @xmath71 can not be identically equal to zero between @xmath72 and some point on the negative imaginary axis , otherwise @xmath69 is not a true branch point .",
    "we find therefore that for @xmath73 the integral will dominate any exponential of the type @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "the conclusion is therefore that there will be a non - exponential contribution to the transition matrix element which will ultimately dominate any exponential decay .",
    "this is the anomaly .",
    "let us now discuss some details of this anomaly .",
    "let @xmath37 be a real , rational analytic function of @xmath19 , positive when @xmath19 is positive .",
    "then for _ negative _",
    "@xmath19 we find that : |()=-()(-)+a(,c )    with @xmath76 a positive number with the dimension of @xmath19 . that branch is chosen where the logarithm is real .",
    "then the function @xmath77 is a real and rational analytic function of @xmath19 , finite around @xmath69 and which for negative @xmath19 is sufficiently positive .",
    "now we consider two cases :    1 .",
    "then for small @xmath19 : --|()=--|()()(- ) + the `` jump across the cut '' of the integrand is then : f()-0 ( 0 ) 2 .",
    "we have : and we find then for small @xmath19 :    the conclusion is that the transition matrix element behaves non - exponentially but goes faster to zero than @xmath80 for large @xmath15 .",
    "correspondingly the survival rate goes slower than exponential but faster than @xmath81 to zero for large @xmath15 .",
    "of course , the anomaly has been demonstrated only in a simplified model which however is realistic enough to warrant the expectation that the anomaly is characteristic for a much wider class of models .",
    "it may even be unavoidable .",
