    "with the commissioning of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , nuclear collision physics entered the collider era .",
    "new phenomena have been presented in @xmath2 collisions at the center - of - mass energy @xmath3 130 gev / nucleon@xcite .",
    "negative hadron multiplicities are significantly increased compared to proton - antiproton collisions@xcite .",
    "some of the data , such as the antiproton - to - proton ratios@xcite , are reported to contradict perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) calculations .",
    "initial efforts to understand hadron spectra from nuclear reactions at rhic using pqcd have been published recently@xcite .",
    "however , there is still a strong debate on how to apply pqcd to hadron production even in proton - proton ( @xmath4 ) collisions . with rhic running at the full energy , and experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at several",
    "tev / nucleon soon to follow , `` clean '' processes , where pqcd works well in @xmath4 collisions , are needed to test pqcd in nuclear reactions at collider energies .",
    "it is particularly important to distinguish between expected nuclear effects and `` new physics '' .",
    "the production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons has been extensively studied at tevatron energy ( @xmath5 tev ) .",
    "perturbative qcd proved to be very successful in explaining the cdf@xcite and d0@xcite data .",
    "due to the large mass of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and no final state rescattering in their production process , power corrections are expected to be small .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 and @xmath1 production could provide a bench mark test for pqcd at rhic and lhc in both @xmath4 and nuclear collisions .",
    "luminosity remains a concern at rhic , in particular in @xmath4 collisions .",
    "the bulk of the data for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production is concentrated in the small transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) region , where @xmath6 is much smaller than the corresponding heavy boson mass ( @xmath7 ) . when @xmath8 , the @xmath6 distributions calculated order - by - order in @xmath9 in conventional fixed - order perturbation theory receive a large logarithm , @xmath10 , at every power of @xmath9 , even in the leading order in @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently small @xmath6 , the convergence of the conventional perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath9 is impaired , and the logarithms must be resummed .",
    "resummation of the large logarithms in qcd can be carried out either in @xmath6-space directly , or in the so - called `` impact parameter '' , @xmath11-space , which is a fourier conjugate of the @xmath6-space .",

    "non - perturbative input is needed for the large @xmath11 region .",
    "the dependence of the pqcd results on the non - perturbative input is not weak if the original extrapolation proposed by css is used .",
    "recently , a new extrapolation scheme was proposed , based on solving the renormalization group equations , including power corrections@xcite . using the new extrapolation formula ,",
    "the dependence of the pqcd result on the non - perturbative input was significantly reduced .",
    "this was achieved without matching the fixed - order calculations .",
    "the results agree with the d0 nd cdf data very well in the entire @xmath6 interval from @xmath15 gev to @xmath6 as large as the the vector mass .",
    "in addition , in this new extrapolation formalism , power corrections can be studied systematically for @xmath4 to proton - nucleus ( @xmath16 ) to nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath17 ) collisions .",
    "factorization plays a key role in pqcd predictions of observables . at rhic and lhc",
    ", nuclear collisions reach an unprecedented energy scale .",
    "factorization can not be extrapolated easily to @xmath17 collisions from hadron - hadron collisions@xcite , and power corrections may become important @xcite .",
    "there are two types of power corrections : ( 1 ) power corrections directly to the physical observables ( type - i ) and ( 2 ) power corrections to the evolution of renormalization group equations ( type - ii ) .",
    "type - i power correction are proportional to powers of @xmath18 , q being the physical large scale ( momentum ) .",
    "these are small for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production as a result of the large mass of the particles in question .",
    "type - ii power corrections are proportional to powers of @xmath19 , with evolution scale @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , physical observables carry the effect of type - ii power corrections for all @xmath21 $ ] , with the boundary condition at the scale @xmath22 .",
    "even with large mass , @xmath0 and @xmath1 can still carry a large effect of type - ii power corrections .",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite provides a way to study the effect of type - ii power corrections numerically .",
    "based on the numerical results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of type - ii power corrections is also expected to be small for heavy vector boson production in @xmath4 collisions . in nuclear collisions , type - ii power corrections will be enhanced by the nuclear size . here",
    "we study the effects of enhanced power correction in @xmath16 and @xmath17 collisions .",
    "the rapidity distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons at lhc was calculated recently and the effect of shadowing was discussed in this context@xcite .",
    "the decay spectrum of @xmath1 was suggested as an alternative reference process for @xmath23 suppression at lhc , since the drell - yan lepton pairs at low mass are expected to be dominated by @xmath24 decay . as most of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons observed in the experiment",
    "will be in the small transverse momentum region , it is of great interest to study the nuclear effects on massive gauge boson transverse momentum distributions .",
    "these effects include both the nuclear modification of the parton distribution function ( shadowing ) , and the initial state power corrections . the second part of the present paper is devoted to these subjects .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we review the css @xmath11-space resummation formalism and the new procedure@xcite to extrapolate the pqcd calculation to the large @xmath11 region is outlined .",

    "the sensitivity of the prediction to the non - perturbative parameters is discussed .",

    "the functions @xmath51 in eq .",

    "in addition , the @xmath11-dependence in eq .",
    "( [ qz - fnp - m ] ) is separated according to different physics origins .",
    "the @xmath62-dependence mimics the summation of the perturbatively calculable leading power contributions to the kernels @xmath63 and @xmath64 in eq.s ( [ css - k - rg ] ) and ( [ css - g - rg ] ) of the appendix , respectively , to all orders in the running coupling constant @xmath65 with the scale @xmath20 running into the nonperturbative region @xcite . the @xmath66-dependence of the @xmath67 term is a direct consequence of dynamical power corrections to the renormalization group equations of the kernels @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and has an explicit dependence on @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath68 term represents the effect of the non - vanishing intrinsic parton transverse momentum .",
    "as we discuss later , these two terms behave differently in nuclear collisions .",
    "a remarkable feature of the @xmath11-space resummation formalism is that the resummed exponential factor @xmath55 $ ] ( see eq .  ( [ css - w - sol ] ) ) suppresses the @xmath11-integral when @xmath11 is larger than @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath70 , ( where @xmath71 represents the scale at which pqcd starts to be applicable ) , it is possible that the fourier transform in eq .",
    "( [ css - gen ] ) is dominated by a region of @xmath11 much smaller than @xmath72 , and the calculated @xmath6 distributions are insensitive to the nonperturbative information at large @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , it was shown using the saddle point method that , for a large enough @xmath7 , a qcd perturbation calculation is valid even at @xmath73@xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the value of the saddle point strongly depends on the collision energy @xmath37 , in addition to its well - known @xmath74 dependence . because of the steep evolution of parton distributions at small @xmath75 , the @xmath37 dependence of the @xmath38 in eq .",

    "when @xmath80 , the bessel function suppresses the large @xmath11 region of the integration .",
    "because the argument of the bessel function is proportional to @xmath6 , the large @xmath11 region is more suppressed if @xmath6 is larger . in the following , we focus on the saddle point at @xmath73 .",

    "an impression about the importance of power corrections can be obtained by comparing results with @xmath96 gev@xmath91 to those with power corrections turned off ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "we therefore define the ratio of these quantities : @xmath98    the cross sections in the above equation and in the results presented in this paper have been integrated over rapidity and invariant mass squared from eq .",
    "( [ css - gen ] ) . for the integration over @xmath99",
    ", we use the `` narrow width approximation''@xcite . with respect to rapidity",

    "2(b ) displays @xmath101 of eq .  ( [ sigma - g2 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath101 ratio converges to unity ( i.e. very small power corrections ) with increasing @xmath6 , and the effect of power corrections is about five percent for @xmath73 . however , when @xmath104  gev , the deviation of @xmath101 from unity is under two percent .",
    "a very similar conclusion can be drawn from fig .  3 , concerning @xmath0 production in @xmath4 collisions at the same energy : the dependence on the nonperturbative input is weak even at the lowest transverse momenta .",
    "fig .- s 4 and 5 contain similar information for @xmath1 and @xmath0 production in @xmath4 collisions at the planned lhc nucleus - nucleus collision energy of @xmath105 tev , while the cross section and @xmath101 are given for the lhc @xmath4 energy of @xmath106 tev in fig .-",
    "s  6 and 7 . at all energies ,",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath0 production cross section is about 3 to 5 times that of the @xmath1 production cross section . otherwise , the results for @xmath1 and @xmath0 production are very similar , because the saddle points are almost at the same place in @xmath11 space in the two cases .",
    "as it has been pointed out in ref@xcite , the position of the saddle point is determined by two terms : the first term is inversely proportional to the mass of the vector boson , and the second term is proportional to the derivative of the parton distribution function with respect to the scale at @xmath107 or @xmath108 . at the collider energies considered here , the second term is negative . while @xmath109 is a little smaller than @xmath110 , and thus the first term is larger for @xmath111 than for @xmath1 , the contribution from the second term will effect the saddle point for @xmath0 more than that of the @xmath1 with a small @xmath107 and @xmath108 .    as expected from fig .  1",
    ", the dependence on the nonperturbative input decreases with increasing collision energy .",
    "the @xmath101 ratio is smaller than one percent at lhc for both @xmath112  tev and @xmath113 tev , even when @xmath73 .",
    "these results confirm that the predictive power of the formalism is very good at rhic and excellent at lhc .",
    "they also show that the effect of power corrections is very small at lhc for almost the whole @xmath6 region and it is also negligible for rhic when @xmath6 is larger than @xmath114 gev .",
    "in lack of nuclear effects on the hard collision , the production of heavy vector bosons in nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath17 ) collisions should scale , compared to the production in @xmath4 collisions , as the number of hard collisions , @xmath17 . however , there are several nuclear effects on the hard collision in a heavy - ion reaction .",
    "we distinguish three categories of these effects : isospin effects , the modification of the parton distribution function in the nucleus , and the enhancement of power corrections by the nuclear size . in this section",
    "we discuss the first two of these nuclear effects .",
    "power corrections will be treated separately in the next section .",
    "as the parton distribution of neutrons is different from that of the protons , the production cross section of heavy vector bosons in proton - neutron and neutron - neutron interactions differs from the corresponding production cross section in @xmath4 collisions .",
    "this difference is the source of the so - called isospin effects . to study the isospin effects ,",
    "let us introduce @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the atomic numbers and @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the mass numbers of the colliding nuclei , and the cross section @xmath120 has been averaged over @xmath17 , while @xmath121 is the @xmath4 cross section ( with @xmath122 ) . since the @xmath123 coupling in @xmath1 production is replaced by @xmath124 coupling to produce @xmath0 bosons , we expect @xmath125 to be complementary for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production , i.e. if one of these ratios is larger than one , the other ratio should be smaller than unity .",
    "next we turn to the phenomenon of shadowing .",
    "we use the term shadowing in the general sense , referring to all modifications of the parton distribution function in the environment of the nucleus@xcite .",
    "this includes , in different regions of @xmath75 , the phenomena of shadowing ( in the strict sense ) , anti - shadowing , and the emc effect .",
    "it is also important to note that we define shadowing effects as leading twist effects , not including power corrections@xcite .",
    "thus , shadowing effects and power correction are clearly separated in the present work .    in general ,",
    "shadowing is expected to be a function of @xmath75 , the scale @xmath126 , and of the position in the nucleus .",
    "the latter dependence means that in heavy - ion collisions , shadowing should be impact parameter ( @xmath12 ) dependent .",
    "the parameterizations of shadowing in the literature take into account some of these effects , but no complete parameterization exists to date to our knowledge .",
    "for example , the hijing parameterization includes impact parameter dependence , but does not deal with the scale dependence@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the eks98@xcite and hkm@xcite parameterizations have a scale dependence , but do not consider impact parameter dependence .",
    "( the latter parameterizations have been compared recently@xcite . ) since in this paper we concentrate on impact - parameter integrated results , where the effect of the @xmath12-dependence of shadowing is relatively unimportant@xcite , and we focus more attention on scale dependence , we find the eks98 shadowing parameterization most appropriate for our present purposes .",
    "therefore we use eks98 shadowing@xcite in this work .    similarly to eq .",
    "( [ sigma_iso ] ) for isospin effects , we define a shadowing ratio , @xmath127 thus , @xmath128 incorporates the effects of both shadowing and the isospin composition of the nuclei .",
    "furthermore , in this section we take @xmath97 throughout , switching off power corrections .",
    "the enhanced power corrections in @xmath16 and @xmath17 collisions will be discussed separately in the next section .",
    "displays @xmath125 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath128 ( full lines ) as functions of @xmath6 for @xmath1 production ( fig .",
    "8(a ) ) and @xmath0 production ( fig .",
    "8(b ) ) , respectively , at @xmath3 350 mev .",
    "the same information is presented at @xmath3 5.5 tev in fig .",
    "we find that @xmath129 for @xmath1 production and @xmath130 for @xmath0 production at both energies , complementing each other , as expected .",
    "how close @xmath125 is to unity depends on the region of @xmath75 that has the dominant contribution to the cross section . at lhc , @xmath131 , and",
    "the magnitude of the isospin effects is about 2% .",
    "this is because when @xmath75 is in this range , the difference of the distributions of @xmath132 and @xmath133 quarks in the nucleus is very small . at rhic ,",
    "where the dominant @xmath134 , the isospin effects are about 20% in the small @xmath6 region .",
    "we have also checked that the scale dependence of isospin effects is not important . in fig .",
    "8 , we also show a dotted line , which is the ratio of @xmath128 to @xmath125 , and thus can be considered to display the effect of `` pure shadowing '' .",
    "pure shadowing appears as an approximately constant reduction of 3 - 5% at @xmath134 .",
    "the appearance of @xmath128 ( full lines ) is more surprising at @xmath3 5.5 tev ( fig .",
    "9 ) . since at lhc , even at @xmath135 gev , @xmath136",
    ", we are still in the `` strict shadowing '' region .",
    "therefore , the fact that @xmath137 for 20 gev @xmath138 70 gev is not `` antishadowing '' ; rather , it is a consequence of the change of the shape of the cross section from @xmath4 to @xmath17 reactions . in @xmath4 collisions ,",
    "the maximum of the cross section is at @xmath139 3.7 gev . in @xmath17 collisions ,",
    "the peak is shifted by about 0.4 gev in the direction of large transverse momenta . on the other hand",
    ", the contributions from the scale @xmath140 to @xmath7 have been resummed .",
    "resummation plays a more important role for small @xmath6 than for large @xmath6 . in eks98 ,",
    "the strict shadowing effect is more important for small scales , such as @xmath141 gev , than for @xmath142 .",
    "thus , a relatively small shift in the peak position brings about the rise of @xmath128 above unity .",
    "the shadowing ratio @xmath128 dips below one again at a certain @xmath6 , to approach the fixed - order pqcd result when @xmath142 .",
    "the situation in fig .",
    "9 can be understood by noting that shadowing in the resummed transverse momentum distributions is sensitive to the scale used to describe the nuclear effects on the parton distribution function .",
    "after this discussion one may want to revisit fig .  8 and ask why is @xmath128 flat at rhic energies .",
    "the answer lies in the observation that the emc region of @xmath75 dominates the cross section at @xmath3 350 mev .",
    "there is no sensitivity to the scale in that region in eks98 .    in summary ,",
    "the shadowing effects in the @xmath6 distribution of heavy bosons at rhic and lhc are sensitive to the scale of the nuclear parton distribution .",
    "the available data on the scale dependence of nuclear parton distribution functions are very limited@xcite .",
    "theoretical studies ( such as eks98 ) are based on the the assumption that the nuclear parton distribution functions differ from the parton distributions in the free proton , but obey the same dglap evolution@xcite .",
    "therefore , the tranverse momentum distribution of heavy bosons at lhc in @xmath143 collisions can provide a further test of our understanding of the nuclear parton distributions .",
    "we have seen in section [ sec2 ] that the effect of power corrections on the resummed cross section is very weak in @xmath4 collisions at both rhic and lhc . in @xmath16 and @xmath17",

    "we discuss the enhancement of power corrections in nuclear collisions .",
    "as @xmath89 represents the effect of the partons non - vanishing intrinsic transverse momentum , it should not have a strong nuclear dependence . on the other hand , @xmath67 arises as a result of dynamical power corrections , and should be enhanced by the nuclear size , i.e. proportional to @xmath144 . considering the enhancement , we get @xmath145 gev@xmath91 for @xmath146 and @xmath147 gev@xmath91 for @xmath143 reactions .    in order to study the effects of power corrections , we now define @xmath148 in nuclear collision as follows : @xmath149 where the numerator represents the result of the full calculation , with isospin effects , shadowing , and power corrections taken into account , and the denominator was introduced in connection with eq .",

    "10(b ) the solid line is @xmath148 in @xmath146 collisions and the dashed line is @xmath101 in @xmath4 collisions at the same energy . at @xmath152 gev , @xmath148 is about 0.88 , in contrast to about 0.95 in @xmath4 collisions .",
    "the effects of power corrections are enhanced about three times in @xmath153 collision relative to @xmath4 collisions . however , even for @xmath154 , the effect of power corrections is only about 10% , and for @xmath155 gev , the effect remains under 5% .",
    "thus the effect of power corrections is weak in @xmath146 collisions at rhic . as for the situation at lhc in @xmath143 collisions , displayed in fig .",
    "11 , the effects of power corrections appear to be enhanced by a similar factor ( about three ) from @xmath4 to @xmath143 collisions at lhc .",
    "the reason for the similar enhancement is the interplay of the higher energy and the larger value of @xmath95 mentioned above . in any case , the enhanced power corrections remain under 3% in the [ 0,80 ] gev @xmath6 interval for @xmath143 at lhc .",
    "the results for @xmath1 production are similar to those for @xmath0 production .",
    "we have demonstrated that the predictive power of a resummed pqcd calculation for heavy boson production is very good at rhic and excellent at lhc , because the dependence of the cross sections on the non - perturbative input is weak .",
    "this makes @xmath0 and @xmath1 production reliably calculable at the energies considered . on the experimental side",
    ", @xmath0 and @xmath1 production should be an early observable at lhc ( with sufficiently high production rates ) in both @xmath4 and nuclear collisions . at rhic",
    ", production rates may remain on the low side , in particular in @xmath4 collisions . in all cases , the cross sections peak at relatively low transverse momenta , and we calculate the peak position for all systems considered .",
    "we have examined the effects of the isospin composition of nuclei and of shadowing in nuclear collisions .",
    "we find that isospin effects are modest in @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at the energies considered , while shadowing is relatively unimportant at rhic , but plays an important role at lhc in shaping the transverse momentum distributions .",
    "this comes about because of the sensitivity of shadowing effects to the scale of the parton distribution functions .",
    "we also studied the magnitude of power corrections in @xmath4 and nuclear collisions .",
    "power corrections are small in @xmath4 collisions , and , even though part of these corrections is enhanced in nuclear collisions by a factor of @xmath144 , they remain below 10% ( even at very low transverse momenta ) in @xmath17 reactions .    as indicated by the above observations , the resummed pqcd formalism yields accurate results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 transverse momentum distributions at rhic and lhc .",
    "the production of heavy bosons can therefore serve as a further test of the nuclear parton distributions . in more general terms ,",
