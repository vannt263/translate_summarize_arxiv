    "models with flat `` universal '' extra dimensions ( ued ) in which all fields propagate in the extra dimensional bulk have received a much recent attention @xcite ( for pre - dating ideas closely related to ued models see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "they are of phenomenological interest for two primary reasons .",
    "first , among all extra - dimensional models with standard model ( sm ) charged fields propagating in the bulk , the mass scale of the compactification is most weakly constrained @xcite,@xcite - @xcite , this mass scale being well within the reach of future collider experiments .",
    "moreover the collider signatures of kaluza - klein ( kk ) particle production in ued models are easily confused with those of superpartner production in some supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "second , ued models provide a viable dark matter candidate  the lightest kaluza - klein particle ( lkp )  which is stable by virtue of a conserved discrete quantum number intrinsic to the model .",
    "electroweak radiative corrections imply that the lkp is neutral @xcite with a thermal relic density consistent with observation for the mass range allowed by collider bounds @xcite .",
    "both of these features result from the existence of a conserved @xmath2 kk parity .",
    "models in which all fields propagate in the extra dimensional bulk allow conservation of a discrete ( due to the finite volume ) subgroup of translation invariance , implying that the momentum in the extra dimension(s ) , @xmath3 , remains a conserved discrete quantity . in terms of the 4d effective theory , this translates into the conservation of kk mode number .",
    "however , in order to obtain chiral fermions in the 4d effective theory , the extra dimension(s ) have to be compactified on an orbifold , which inevitably breaks translation invariance and hence induces kk - number violation , but still preserves kk - parity as a conserved @xmath2 quantum number .",
    "this kk - parity implies processes with a single first kk excitation and standard model particles only are forbidden , and the lightest kk - particle is stable .    specializing to the case of one extra dimension , the bound on the compactification scale @xmath4 from direct non - detection is @xmath5  gev @xcite being a factor of 2 lower than the nave estimate for models without kk parity conservation .",
    "comparable bounds have been derived from the analysis of electro - weak precision tests ( ewpt ) @xcite , the improvement of which is a primary focus of this paper .",
    "the bound from the @xmath6 branching ratio is of order @xmath7 gev @xcite ( the bounds from the @xmath6 left - right asymmetry , and from the muon anomalous magenetic moment , are significantly weaker ) , while @xmath8 leads to @xmath9 gev @xcite and constraints from fcnc processes @xcite are of the order of @xmath10 gev .",
    "concerning current and future experiments , run ii at the tevatron will be able to detect kk - particles if @xmath11  gev while the lhc will reach @xmath12  tev @xcite , well beyond the currently excluded compactification scale .    in this paper",
    ", we will extend the analysis of constraints from ewpt to arrive at a significantly more stringent bound on the compactification scale . within the remaining allowed parameter space",
    ", we then investigate the direct and indirect detection prospects of the lkp dark matter candidate .",
    "specifically , in section  2 we briefly review ued models , following refs.@xcite . in sections 3 and 4 ,",
    "the constraints from ewpt are investigated including the full lep2 data set following the general analysis of @xcite .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite , this _ a priori _ requires an extended set of ewpt parameters , and we calculate the contributions from universal extra dimension models to this extended set . a fit to the lep1 and lep2 data set leads to",
    "significantly improved bounds on @xmath13 as a function of the unknown higgs mass @xmath14 .",
    "we emphasize that the two - loop standard model higgs contributions to the ewpt parameters are included in this fit following the simple accurate numerical interpolation of @xcite . in section  5",
    "we discuss the implications of this improved bound for kk dark matter , particularly the prospects of direct and indirect detection .",
    "finally section  6 contains our conclusions while an appendix examines , in an improved version of nave dimensional analysis , the maximum scale of applicability of the 5-dimensional ued theory with which we calculate .",
    "we consider the 5-dimensional extension of the single higgs doublet standard model with all fields propagating in the extra dimension .",

    "the 5d higgs scalar @xmath25 is in the representation @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and for simplicity the family indicies on the fields and 5d yukawa couplings , @xmath28 , are suppressed .",
    "chiral fermions are obtained at the kk zero mode level by compactifying the extra dimension on the orbifold @xmath29 .",
    "the length of the orbifold is @xmath30 and the associated kk mass scale @xmath4 . by integrating out the extra dimension ,",
    "every 5d field yields an infinite tower of effective 4d kaluza - klein modes .",
    "for compactification on @xmath22 , the theory would be translation invariant in the extra dimension , implying conservation of 5-momentum and therefore kk mode number @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) in every vertex , however , for compactification on an orbifold , the orbifold boundaries break translation invariance and therefore 5-momentum conservation . in the kk picture , this corresponds to the existence of kk number violating operators ( which are induced at loop - level even if not included in the bare 5d lagrangian ) . by definition of the @xmath29 orbifold ,",
    "the 5d theory however still has a symmetry under reflection in the extra dimension @xmath33 . in terms of kk - modes",
    "this translates into the conservation of kk - parity : _",
    "i k_i=0  2 .",

    "the mass of the @xmath42-th kk - mode is given by @xmath43 for fermions and gauge bosons with the first kk - excitation of the photon being the lightest kk - particle .",
    "due to kk - parity conservation , the lkp is stable , providing a dark matter candidate .",
    "the kk - interaction vertices for the ued model are given in refs.@xcite .",
    "even below the kk - particle production threshold @xmath44 , kk - particles enter experimental constraints via virtual effects in radiative corrections . at one - loop level and at lep energies , vertex corrections and box diagrams are suppressed compared to self - energy contributions @xcite .",
    "higgs - kk mode contributions to vertices and box diagrams are suppressed by small yukawa couplings because no top pair can be produced at lep energies , while kk - gauge boson contributions are parametrically suppressed by a factor of @xmath45 .",
    "thus the ued radiative corrections are approximately oblique , flavor independent .",
    "oblique corrections are traditionally parameterized by the peskin - takeuchi @xmath46 parameters @xcite or equivalently by the ewpt parameters @xmath47 @xcite , both of which are defined in terms of the gauge - boson self - energies .    using an effective field theory approach ,",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath48 , and @xmath49 do not form a complete parameterization of relevant corrections to the standard model , where the only significant deviations from the sm reside in the self - energies of the vector bosons .",

    "a convenient way of expressing the @xmath59-pole lep1 experimental constraints on the electroweak precision observables is in terms of the @xmath60 parameters whose determination are independent of the unknown mass of the higgs .",

    "thus if @xmath71 is the scale of new physics , the expectation is that new physics contributions to @xmath49 and @xmath68 will be suppressed by powers of @xmath72 compared to the new physics contributions to @xmath66 and @xmath58 .",
    "however for the purpose of investigating the bounds on new physics , such as the kk mass scale @xmath13 , it is not correct to restrict the analysis to @xmath73 , and exclude @xmath49 and @xmath68 .",
    "even though the new physics contributions to @xmath49 and @xmath68 are expected to be suppressed from an effective theory point of view , this is not reflected in the experimental constraints on these ewpo .",
    "for example the lep2 data determine @xmath74 with a similar accuracy as the `` dominant '' parameters .",
    "the fact that the experimentally preferred value is _ not _ suppressed ought to be included in the analysis .",
    "we therefore keep the full parameter set .",
    "in this section we calculate the contributions to the extended set of ewpo from ued models and obtain an improved constraint on @xmath75 by performing a @xmath76-fit to the experimental values given in eqs.([epsilonexp]-[xywexp ] ) .",
    "we note in passing that the consequences of the combined lep1 and lep2 constraints have so far been explored in 5d models with gauge bosons in the extra dimension and higgsless models @xcite , for supersymmetry @xcite and for little higgs models @xcite .    concerning ued models , for low higgs mass , the dominant constraint on @xmath75",
    "is expected from the measurement of @xmath77 rather than @xmath78 while @xmath79 is further suppressed . for large @xmath14",
    "however , the one - loop standard model contribution to @xmath77 can compensate for the kk - contribution such that a combined @xmath80 analysis is necessary . in @xcite ,",
    "one - loop kk contributions to the @xmath78 and @xmath77 parameters are fitted to the experimentally determined values of @xmath80 from lep1 , yielding a constraint on the @xmath81 parameter space ( see figure 3 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the lowest allowed compactification scale is @xmath82 gev at high @xmath83 gev as a result of this cancellation in the @xmath77 parameter . due to the significant dependence of the current limit on the cancellation in contributions to @xmath77 at large @xmath14 where higher terms in the loop expansion for the higgs - dependent contributions are becoming large , it is important to include the two - loop sm contributions to test if this cancellation is stable .",
    "we show below that the 2-loop higgs contributions destroy the cancellation resulting in an improved constraint on @xmath84 . a further improvement results from the inclusion of lep2 data , specifically the measurements of the @xmath64 parameters .",

    "this lack of cancellation is the reason for elimination of the heavy - higgs - mass and low @xmath13 region .",
    "second , the inclusion of lep2 data into the analysis necessitated the use of an extended set of well - determined electroweak precision observables as shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "these new ewpo provide additional constraints , further lifting the bound on @xmath13 .",
    "in recent years , the lightest kk particle ( lkp ) in ued models has become a rather popular candidate for the dark matter of our universe @xcite . in this section",
    ", we will review the phenomenology of kk dark matter in this scenario , and discuss the detection prospects for such a particle in light of the new electroweak precision constraints presented in this article .    as stated earlier ,",
    "the most natural choice for the lkp in ued models is the first kk excitation of the hypercharge gauge boson , @xmath94 .",
    "such a state , being electrically neutral and colorless , can serve as a viable candidate for dark matter .",
    "one attractive feature of this candidate is that its thermal relic abundance is naturally near the measured quantity of cold dark matter for @xmath95 tev .",
    "the number density of the lkp evolves according to the boltzman equation @xmath96,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the hubble rate , @xmath97 denotes the equlibrium number density of the lkp , and @xmath98 is the lkp s self - annihilation cross section , given by   @xmath99 numerical solutions of the boltzman equation yield a relic density of @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 is the relic freeze - out temperature , @xmath103 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom available at freeze out ( @xmath104 for the case at hand ) , and @xmath105 and @xmath106 are terms in the partial wave expansion of the annihilation cross section , @xmath107 .",
    "note that in this simple case with only the lkp participating in the freeze - out process , @xmath106 can safely be neglected .",
    "evaluation of @xmath108 leads to @xmath109 , \\label{xf}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is an order 1 parameter determined numerically and @xmath51 is the number of degrees of freedom of the lkp . note that since @xmath108 appears in the logarithm as well as on the left hand side of the equation , this expression must be solved by iteration .",
    "wimps generically freeze - out at temperatures in the range of approximately @xmath111 20 to 30 .",
    "when the cross section of eq.([annlkp ] ) is inserted into eqs.([sol ] ) and  ( [ xf ] ) , a relic abundance within the range of the cold dark matter density measured by wmap ( @xmath112 ) @xcite can be attained for @xmath113 approximately in the range of 850 to 950 gev .",
    "this conclusion can be substantially modified if other kk modes contribute to the freeze - out process , however .    to include the effects of other kk modes in the freeze - out process , we adopt the following formalism . in eqs.([sol ] ) and  ( [ xf ] )",
    ", we replace the cross section ( @xmath114 , denoting the appropriate combinations of @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) with an effective quantity which accounts for all particle species involved @xmath115 similarly , we replace the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath51 , with the effective quantity @xmath116 in these expressions , the sums are over kk species , @xmath117 denotes the coannihilation cross section between species @xmath118 and @xmath42 and the @xmath119 s denote the fractional mass splitting between that state and the lkp .    to illustrate how the presence of multiple kk species can affect the freeze - out process",
    ", we will describe two example cases .",
    "first , consider a case in which the coannihilation cross section between the two species , @xmath120 , is large compared to the lkp s self - annihilation cross section , @xmath121",
    ". if the second state is not much heavier than the lkp ( @xmath122 is small ) , then @xmath123 may be considerably larger than @xmath121 , and thus the residual relic density of the lkp will be reduced .",
    "physically , this case represents a second particle species depleting the wimp s density through coannihilations .",
    "this effect is often found in the case of supersymmetry models in which coannihilations between the lightest neutralino and another superpartner , such as a chargino , stau , stop , gluino or heavier neutralino , can substantially reduce the abundance of neutralino dark matter .",
    "the second illustrative case is quite different .",
    "if @xmath120 is comparatively small , then the effective cross section tends toward @xmath124 .",
    "if @xmath125 is not too large , @xmath123 may be smaller than the lkp s self - annihilation cross section alone .",
    "physically , this scenario corresponds to two species freezing out quasi - independently , followed by the heavier species decaying into the lkp , thus enhancing its relic density .",
    "although this second case does not often apply to neutralinos , kk dark matter particles may behave in this way for some possible arrangements of the kk spectra .",
    "very recently , the lkp freeze - out calculation has been performed , including all coannihilation channels , by two independent groups  @xcite .",
    "we will summarize their conclusions briefly here .",
    "as expected , the effects of coannihilation on the lkp relic abundance depend critically on the kk spectrum considered .",
    "if strongly interacting kk states are less than roughly @xmath126 more heavy than the lkp mass , the effective lkp annihilation cross section can be considerably enhanced , thus reducing the relic abundance .",
    "kk quarks which are between 5% and 1% more massive than the lkp lead to an lkp with the measured dark matter abundance over the range of masses , @xmath127 1500 to 2000 gev .",
    "if kk gluons are also present with similar masses , @xmath113 as heavy as 2100 to 2700 gev is required to generate the observed relic abundance .",
    "we thus conclude that if kk quarks or kk gluons are not much more massive than the lkp , the new constraints presented in this article do not reach the mass range consistent with the observed abundance of cold dark matter .",
    "on the other hand , it is possible that all of the strongly interacting kk modes may be considerably more heavy than the lkp . in this circumstance",
    ", other kk states may still affect the lkp s relic abundance . if , for example , all three families of kk leptons are each 1% more massive than the lkp , the observed relic abundance is generated only for @xmath113 between approximately 550 and 650 gev .",
    "this range is excluded by the constraints presented in this article .",
    "if the kk leptons are instead 5% more massive than the lkp , the observed abundance is found for @xmath128 670 to 730 gev , which is excluded at around the 99% confidence level .",
    "we thus conclude that electroweak precision measurements are not consistent with dark matter in this model if kk leptons are within approximately 5% of the lkp mass , unless other kk states are also quasi - degenerate .",
    "the constraints put forth here can have a substantial impact on the prospects for the direct and indirect detection of kk dark matter .",
    "firstly , direct detection experiments benefit from the larger elastic scattering cross sections found for smaller values of @xmath113 .",
    "spin - dependent scattering of the lkp scales with @xmath129 , while the spin - independent cross section goes like @xmath130 @xcite . in either case ,",
    "the largest scattering rates are expected for the lightest lkps .",
    "furthermore , heavier wimps have a smaller local number density , and thus a smaller scattering rate in direct detection experiments .    even if the new constraints presented here are not taken into account , the prospects for the direct detection of kk dark matter is somewhat poor .",
    "cross sections are expected to be smaller than roughly @xmath131 pb and @xmath132 pb for spin - independent and dependent scattering , respectively @xcite , both of which are well beyond the reach of existing experiments .",
    "next generation experiments may be able to reach this level of sensitivity , however .",
    "the situation is rather different for the case of indirect detection .",
    "the annihilation cross section of lkps is proportional to @xmath133 , and thus a heavier lkp corresponds to a lower rate of annihilation products being generated in regions such as the galactic center , the local halo , external galaxies and in local substructure . for dark matter searches using gamma - rays from regions such as the galactic center @xcite ,",
    "this is probably of marginal consequence , considering the very large astrophysical uncertainties involved .",
    "the annihilation rate of lkps in the local halo , however , has less associated astrophysical uncertainty .",
    "lkp annihilations in the galactic halo to anti - matter particles @xcite , positrons in particular , may be potentially observable if the lkp annihilation cross section is large enough , _",
    "i.e_.  if the lkp is sufficiently light .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the cosmic positron excess observed by the heat experiment @xcite could have been generated through the annihilations of lkps in the surrounding few kiloparsecs of our galaxy .",
    "this , however , requires @xmath113 to be in the range of approximately 300 to 400 gev , which is strongly excluded by the results presented in this article .",
    "even if the heat excess is not a product of dark matter annihilations , the presence of kk dark matter in the local halo will possibly be within the reach of future cosmic positron measurements , particularly those of the ams-02 experiment @xcite . assuming a modest degree of local inhomogenity , lkp masses up to @xmath134 gev should be within the reach of ams-02 @xcite .",
    "indirect detection of dark matter using neutrino telescopes , on the other hand , relies on wimps being efficiently captured in the sun , where they then annihilate and generate high - energy neutrinos .",
    "kk dark matter becomes captured in the sun most efficiently through its spin - dependent scattering off of protons .",
    "since this cross section scales with @xmath129 , the constraints presented in this article somewhat limit the rates which might be observed by next generation high - energy neutrino telescopes , such as icecube @xcite .",
    "in particular , a 800 gev lkp could generate approximately 20 or 3 events per year at icecube for kk quark masses 10% or 20% larger than the lkp mass , respectively @xcite .",
    "over several years of observation , a rate in this range could potentially be distinguished from the atmospheric neutrino background .",
    "larger volume experiments ( multi - cubic kilometer ) would be needed to detect an lkp which was significantly heavier than @xmath135  tev .",
