    "for nuclear reactions with two particles of given masses in the exit channel , two parameters are required to specify the final state .",
    "usually , these are taken to be the polar angle and the azimuth of one of the particles .",
    "the direction of the other particle and both energies are then given by energy and momentum conservation .    when three particles are present in the final state , one more momentum vector needs to be specified , thus three more parameters are required .",
    "this means that all observables are a function of five parameters .",
    "often these are taken to be the polar angles and the azimuths of two of the three particles and one parameter that describes how the kinetic energy is shared by the three particles .",
    "this parameter could be , e.g. , the relative energy of particles 1 and 2 .    in order to present and discuss experimental results , one must select one or two independent variables . traditionally , two outgoing particles are measured in coincidence by two ( small ) detectors .",
    "the detector positions determine the polar and azimuthal angles of both particles . in a plot of the energy of the first versus the energy of the second particle , all events lie on a locus .",
    "the position along that locus then serves as the independent variable .",
    "the choice of the detector angles is arbitrary , but their solid angles must be reasonably small to keep the locus defined . to explore the full kinematics of the reaction",
    "the experiment must be repeated with different detector positions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "modern nuclear detection techniques make it possible to build experiments that simultaneously cover a sizable fraction of the entire phase space of the reaction .",
    "measuring the momenta of two outgoing particles yields enough information to define the complete kinematics of an event , with one redundant parameter to spare that may be used for event identification .",
    "one thus has the freedom of choosing any independent variable by sorting the measured events accordingly .    when partitioning the phase space with respect to a given single variable , all other kinematic parameters are ignored .",
    "when one wants to compare the experiment to a model , the corresponding calculation must integrate over these ignored parameters . to carry out this integral",
    ", one must take into account the boundaries of the acceptance of the experiment , as well as variations of the detection efficiency within the acceptance .",
    "it is usually quite difficult to describe the detailed performance of the detection system , and to implement this information in the calculation of an observable by a theoretical method . in this paper",
    "we present a straight - forward method to accomplish this task .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we describe the proposed method . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we outline the underlying theory of three - nucleon break - up reactions and discuss how the calculations can be accelerated for the use in the present context . in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] the new method is applied to the analysis of several polarization observables in the @xmath0 break - up reaction .",
    "these calculations are based on the charge - dependent ( cd ) bonn nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential  @xcite .",

    "let us denote by @xmath1 the set of parameters that is needed to completely describe the kinematics of a given nuclear reaction . to specify the phase - space coordinates of a three - body - final state one requires 5 parameters .",
    "the differential cross section for the reaction with unpolarized collision partners is given by @xmath2 .",
    "a typical polarization observable @xmath3 has the effect of modifying the unpolarized cross section such that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the polarization of the beam or the target or their product , and @xmath3 is a beam analyzing power , a target analyzing power or a spin correlation coefficient . in order to measure @xmath3",
    "one carries out two measurements with opposite sign of the polarization @xmath5 .",
    "the yields @xmath6 accumulated during the two measurements in a phase space region @xmath7 are then given by @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the magnitudes of the two polarizations with opposite sign , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the time - integrated luminosities for the two measurements . the detector efficiency @xmath13 measures the probability with which an event of interest gets registered by the detector system .",
    "for events outside the acceptance of the detector , @xmath14 .",
    "let us assume , for the moment , that the integrated luminosities and polarizations for the two measurements are the same , or @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we then find for the total number of collected events @xmath17 and for the polarization observable in terms of the measured yields    @xmath18    the equation for @xmath19 holds for any point @xmath20 in phase space , but it is obviously impractical to evaluate or discuss observables in a five - dimensional parameter space .",
    "rather , one may select a single independent parameter @xmath21 , ignoring all others .",
    "when the experiment ignores a given parameter , the full range of that parameter within the detector acceptance is included .",
    "thus , for each of the @xmath21 bins , one actually evaluates @xmath22 in a region @xmath23 of phase space , where @xmath24 denotes the range for each of the ignored parameters .",
    "assume now that we wish to compare an experiment @xmath22 to a theoretical model .",
    "the model calculation provides us with a value @xmath25 at any point @xmath26 in phase space . in order to obtain the theoretical equivalent @xmath27 of the experiment we have to average @xmath25 , over the region @xmath24 , weighted by the unpolarized cross section times the experimental efficiency ,    @xmath28    we determine @xmath29 by making use of eq .",

    "the number of occupied @xmath26 elements then equals the total number of events @xmath34 collected in region @xmath24 during the experiment , and the list of the @xmath30 s for occupied bins is then identical to the list of phase space coordinates @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) for all collected events . for a kinematically complete experiment , in which the phase space coordinates @xmath35 are known for each event , the correctly averaged value for a calculation is thus obtained as the mean of the corresponding theoretical values @xmath37 for all events @xmath38 @xmath39 this simple recipe constitutes our proposed method : in order to obtain the average theoretical value , correctly weighted by the product of unpolarized cross section and detector efficiency , one determines the theoretical @xmath37 for each collected event , sums these values and divides by the number of events .",
    "it is easy to see , that the standard deviation of the theoretical value that arises from the randomness of the experimental phase space points that are used to sample the region @xmath24 is given by @xmath40    the method of eq .",
    "( [ eq : method-6 ] ) , in effect , involves an average over theoretical values , weighted by the density in phase space of the actual events .",
    "this density is proportional to the unpolarized cross section and detector efficiency , but it also depends on the polarization asymmetry .",
    "the latter cancels only if the magnitudes of the two polarizations with opposite sign are the same , and the corresponding , time - integrated luminosities @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the same , or @xmath41 and @xmath42 both vanish . if @xmath43 , then the averages @xmath44 and @xmath45 , taken with just the data points with positive or negative polarization , respectively , are different .",
    "it is easy to see that in this case , the desired theoretical average @xmath46 that is free of polarization effects can be obtained from the average @xmath47 obtained with all events according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : method-6 ] ) , by subtracting a correction term , @xmath48 in the experiment  @xcite to which we later apply our method , an effort was made to keep @xmath49 and @xmath50 small , and the correction term of  eq .",
    "[ eq : method-8 ] turned out to be insignificant .",
    "as an example of an application of the method described in this paper , let us consider the proton - deuteron break - up reaction at an energy below the pion production threshold . here , all three nucleons are moving freely in the outgoing channel .",
    "the kinematics of a three body final state is determined by nine variables , but energy and momentum conservation reduces the number of independent variables to five .",
    "assume that a @xmath51 is kinematically complete , as is the case when the energies and directions of the two final - state protons are detected . to describe the final state kinematics we define the jacobi momenta @xmath52 and @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are momenta of the two protons in the center - of - mass system ( see fig .",

    "[ htbp ]   and @xmath56.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    in the remainder of this paper we are concerned only with axial observables that are symmetric with respect to a rotation around the beam axis . for this special case ,",
    "the number of independent variables reduces to four , since only the difference between the azimuths is relevant .",
    "we choose these variables to be @xmath57 , in the center of mass .",
    "the theoretical predictions presented in this work are based on solutions of 3n faddeev equations using realistic nn interaction and a @xmath58-exchange three - nucleon force model . in the following ,",
    "we give a short overview of the underlying formalism . for more details",
    "we refer to  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the transition operator for the break - up process @xmath59 can be expressed in terms of a @xmath60 amplitude as : @xmath61 the operator @xmath60 fulfills faddeev - like equation @xmath62 where the two - body @xmath63-operator is denoted by @xmath63 , the free 3n propagator by @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the sum of a cyclical and an anti - cyclical permutation of three particles .",
    "the three - nucleon force @xmath66 can always be decomposed into a sum of three parts : @xmath67 where @xmath68 singles out nucleon @xmath69 and is symmetrical under the exchange of the other two ones . as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eqt ] ) only one of the three parts occurs explicitly , the others enters via the permutations contained in @xmath65 .    as a 2n - force we use the cd bonn nn potential  @xcite .",
    "this interaction is one of the modern , phenomenological models which describe the 2n data set with a @xmath70 per data point that is very close to one . as a 3nf we take the new version of the tucson - melbourne force - tm 3nf  @xcite",
    "the strong cutoff parameter @xmath71 has been adjusted such that the 3nf together with cd bonn potential reproduces the measured triton binding energy ( @xmath72  @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we present a method to integrate predictions from a theoretical model of a reaction with three bodies in the final state over the region of phase space covered by a given experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the method takes into account the true experimental acceptance , as well as variations of detector efficiency , and eliminates the need for a monte - carlo simulation of the detector setup . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applicable to kinematically complete experiments . </S>",
    "<S> examples for the use of this method include several polarization observables in @xmath0 break - up at 270 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are carried out in the faddeev framework with the cd bonn nucleon - nucleon interaction , with or without the inclusion of an additional three - nucleon force . </S>"
