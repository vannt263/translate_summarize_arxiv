    "a cone is perhaps the one with the simplest nontrivial geometry  it is flat everywhere except at its tip where there is a conical singularity @xcite . due to local flatness the conical singularity does not affect local dynamics ; but it does affect global features such as the solutions of differential equations .",

    ".    there has appeared a considerable number of works on quantum mechanics of a particle in conical spaces , since the early investigations in refs .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that a study on how a conical singularity affects the statistical mechanics of a particle has not yet been pursued .",
    "it should be mentioned that since physics around a topological defect in the bulk of a solid can be seen as physics in an effective conical geometry @xcite , the study of statistical mechanics in conical spaces may help to learn about thermal properties when topological defects are present .",

    "quantum @xmath0 is then studied at low , intermediate and high temperatures , showing that the conical singularity can affect it substantially . in sec .",

    "one begins by defining the background ( a more detailed account on the conical geometry can be found for example in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . a wedge of angle @xmath1 is removed from a disk of radius @xmath2 , and the two opposite sides of the missing wedge are identified , resulting a cone of deficit angle @xmath1 . it is convenient to express @xmath1 in terms of the cone parameter @xmath3 , @xmath4 then a flat disk ( i.e. , absence of conical singularity ) corresponds to @xmath5 , and the cone becomes increasingly sharper as @xmath6 decreases from unity .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a cone with @xmath7 corresponds to the configuration space of a system of two identical particles ( here separate by a maximum distance @xmath2 ) with respect to its centre of mass @xcite .",
    "a free norelativistic particle of mass @xmath8 in thermodynamical equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature @xmath9 is constrained to move on the cone described above .",

    "( [ chamiltonian ] ) leads to a hamiltonian operator which is simply @xmath27 times the flat laplacian written in polar coordinates .",
    "one then faces the task of solving the eigenvalue problem for the flat laplacian operator on the cone @xcite , with the additional boundary condition @xmath28 since the particle is confined to a circular box of radius @xmath2 .",

    "( [ ltc ] ) is a feature of any thermal system whose degree of degeneracy @xmath112 of the first excited energy level @xmath113 varies with some parameter . if @xmath114 is the zero point energy , as @xmath84 , a quick calculation shows that @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "this kind of discontinuity at low temperatures also appears , for example , in the specific heat of the anisotropic rigid rotator @xcite .    recalling that even the main contributions in eq .",

    "such a problem is somewhat similar to that where two distinct approximations for the energy spectrum give the same leading contribution in the expression for the high temperature behavior of @xmath0 ; but different corrections ( e.g. , the anharmonic oscillator in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore , in order to check correctness at every step in using eq . ( [ avalue ] ) to finding subleading contributions , a thorough numerical analysis must be implemented ( it should be noted that this is the approach in ref .",

    "although the background addressed in this work is a cone , for which @xmath6 is not greater than unity [ cf .",
    "( [ cparameter ] ) ] , it should be pointed out that in the context of topological defects in solids @xcite there is room for @xmath117 in the effective geometry corresponding to disclinations . in this case , as @xmath6 increases from unity , @xmath54 approaches @xmath64 and @xmath76 in eq .",
