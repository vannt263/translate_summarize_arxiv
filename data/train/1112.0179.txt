    "the barred nature of the milky way is well - established from nir photometry @xcite and star counts @xcite , from comparing hi and co lv - diagrams with hydrodynamic models @xcite , and from dynamical modelling of the kinematics of bulge stars @xcite .",
    "one open issue is the structure of the inner galactic bulge , for @xmath1 kpc .",
    "is this simply the scaled - down , higher - density parts of the surrounding boxy bulge ?",
    "does it become axisymmetric towards the center ?",
    "does it contain a `` classical '' bulge component ? or",
    "does it even contain a secondary nuclear bar as do about one third of barred galaxies like ours @xcite ?",
    "this issue is important ; for example , a nuclear bar misaligned with the main galactic boxy - bulge bar would substantially modify the morphology of the gas flow in the central galaxy , as illustrated by the simulations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rfc08 ) and @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed red clump ( rc ) star counts in the inner bulge . because rc stars are approximate standard candles , their magnitude distribution is a proxy for the stellar density along the line - of - sight @xcite . determining the maximum of the rc magnitude distribution at various longitudes in a strip at @xmath2 , @xcite found a clear change of slope in the rc longitude profile at @xmath3 , separating a steeper slope in the outer bulge from a shallow slope in the nuclear regions .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed new rc star counts from the vvv survey and found excellent agreement with @xcite .",
    "they also determined the rc maximum versus longitude for @xmath4 and found good agreement with the @xmath2 results , as expected for a triaxially symmetric structure .",
    "this also shows that reddening corrections , which differ greatly between these latitudes , are unlikely to cause the observed change of slope in the longitude profiles .",
    "the rc star counts therefore indicate a significant and fairly sudden change in the structure of the bulge at @xmath5 . here",
    "we analyze the distribution of rc maxima for a suitably oriented boxy bulge - barred galaxy model .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the rc longitude profiles predicted by this model are very similar to the observed profiles .",
    "we show that this can be traced back to the model s density structure becoming more axisymmetric towards the center , and finally we compare the asymmetry of the predicted star count map in the inner bulge region with available analysis of 2mass data .",
    "the model analyzed in this paper stems from the barred galaxy simulation of @xcite and is the same model which we used earlier in order to argue that the long bar and the boxy bulge in the mw are the three - dimensional and planar components of the mw s main bar ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mvg11 ) .",
    "it evolved from an initially exponential disk with @xmath6 embedded in a dark matter halo , and developed a prominent boxy bulge through a buckling instability after @xmath7 gyr . to resolve the nuclear bulge better",
    "the particle distribution is symmetrized with respect to the midplane .",
    "we consider the simulated galaxy at time @xmath8 gyr , some time after the instability when the bar has resumed its evolution and has regrown through further angular momentum transfer to the halo .",
    "the snapshot chosen for our analysis in this paper is that shown in fig .  1 of mvg11 ; however , we have checked that the results given for the nuclear regions below do not significantly change when the snapshot in fig .",
    "2 of mvg11 is used instead .",
    "the stellar population of the galactic bulge is predominantly old ( @xmath9 gyr ) and has a metallicity distribution with fwhm @xmath10 dex around [ fe / h]@xmath11 - 0.1 dex @xcite . in this range",
    "the number of rc stars per unit mass varies within @xmath12 @xcite , so we can assume that the spatial distribution of rc stars is the same as that of model particles ( mass ) .",
    "we project the bulge of this model onto the sky in longitude - latitude coordinates @xmath13 as seen by an observer at @xmath14 kpc distance from the galactic center ( gc hereafter ) , whose line - of - sight ( los ) is at an angle @xmath15 relative to the long axis of the bar ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mvg11 ) . dividing the projected particle distribution into fields of @xmath16 , we sort the particles in each field by distance modulus . to account for the finite width of the luminosity function for red clump giant stars ( rc hereafter ) ,",
    "we convolve each particle with a gaussian of width @xmath17 mag @xcite .",
    "the absolute m@xmath18(rc ) varies by @xmath19 mag over the observed fwhm metallicity range @xcite , corresponding to a @xmath20 of 0.11 mag .",
    "added in quadrature , this gives a total @xmath21 mag .",
    "using @xmath22 instead of @xmath17 mag has a negligible effect on the figures shown below .",
    "[ fig : rcsmoohists ] shows the resulting los magnitude distributions for fields with @xmath23 and several @xmath24 .",
    "the main peak corresponds to the inclined bar and boxy bulge ; it shifts from m - m@xmath25 at @xmath26 on the bar s near side to m - m@xmath27 at @xmath28 on the far side .",
    "the background disk is seen clearly at m - m@xmath29 in the top panel for @xmath26 ; the slope towards m - m=@xmath30 is consistent with the disk scale - length .",
    "this disk feature is similar in absolute numbers but weaker in relative numbers for smaller @xmath31 and seems to blend with the far end of the bar at @xmath28 .",
    "a similar phenomenology appears to be seen in the vvv data ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) , which in addition show a background of k giants not included in the gaussian rc luminosity function .",
    "we determine the maxima of the simulated rc distribution in all fields by fitting a gaussian to the brightest peak of the distribution .",
    "[ fig : rcmaxwithl ] shows the resulting rc longitude profiles for several latitude strips , and compares those at @xmath32 and @xmath33 to the results from @xcite at @xmath34 .",
    "this last step requires choosing an absolute k magnitude for the rc . to shift the model to the magnitude scale of the data , we need to use m@xmath18(rc)= -1.70 .",
    "the most recent m@xmath18(rc)=-1.61 @xcite for the local rc , corrected for population effects @xcite , would predict m@xmath18(rc)@xmath35 . the -1.70 value would thus argue for a shorter distance @xmath36 to the gc , while the best current value is @xmath37 kpc @xcite .",
    "we do not pursue this issue further here .",
    "both the observed @xmath34 longitude profiles and the low - latitude model longitude profiles show the same qualitative result : the steep slope of the rc maxima seen at large positive and negative @xmath38 flattens for small @xmath31 and @xmath2 are equivalent . ] .",
    "the model profile is slightly flatter than the data inside @xmath39 and at @xmath40 , but steeper around @xmath41 .",
    "the origin of the difference at @xmath42 between model and data is unclear ; the maxima in the observed distributions are very broad and the contribution from the disk substantial , but also differential population effects might contribute .",
    "by contrast with the lower latitudes , the @xmath43 model longitude profile shows a markedly weaker flattening in the inner parts @xmath44 .",
    "this model was not constructed to match milky way observations ",
    "it is a generic boxy bulge and bar model from a simulation ; thus we do not expect a perfect match with any milky way data .",
    "the agreement between the low - latitude observed and model profiles is therefore even more striking .",
    "previously , the flattening of the observed longitude profiles has been interpreted as due to a distinct structure in the inner galactic bulge @xcite , perhaps a nuclear bar ( see also * ? ? ? * rfc08 ) .",
    "the simulated model bulge does not contain such a structure .      to understand the cause of the flattening in the model longitude profiles ,",
    "let us first consider a simple thought experiment .",
    "we know that the rc maxima for a thin bar follow approximately the major axis of the bar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for a thicker bar , e.g. , with planar axis ratio @xmath45 , a volume effect arises due to the geometry of the cones with fixed @xmath46 .",
    "this causes the maxima of the rc magnitude distributions to lie behind the maxima of the line - of - sight ( los ) density distributions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mvg11 ) .",
    "however , as long as the density distribution is approximately scale - free , we would expect the rc longitude profile to have a similar slope as for the thin bar , following the orientation of the major axis .",
    "now insert an axisymmetric component with high stellar density in the center of the bar .",
    "if its density is sufficiently high , it will dominate the surrounding bar , and since it is axisymmetric , the slope of its longitude profile will be nearly zero . by lowering the density of the central component",
    ", we will therefore be able to arrange a slope that is between zero and that of the surrounding barred bulge .",
    "this simple reasoning shows that the result of the previous subsection may be explained if the center of the barred bulge has sufficient central concentration and is rounder than the outer bar . while if the shape of the density distribution were to remain independent of radius and only the central concentration were increased , in first order only the total number of stars in the central los",
    "would be changed , which does not shift the maxima in the histograms .",
    "[ fig : projections ] shows the surface density of the barred model galaxy in face - on projection , for two slices through the model .",
    "we see from the left panel that the near - planar part of the boxy bulge - bar shows a significant change in the axis ratio with major axis length , such that the central parts are nearly round ( ellipticity @xmath47 ) while the outer bar is much more elongated ( @xmath48 ) . at the same time , from the spacing of the contours we see a change of slope in the major axis density profile , which sets in at approximately major axis length @xmath49 pc corresponding in projection to @xmath50 .",
    "the maxima of the los density distributions and the rc magnitude distributions overplotted on the surface density clearly show the resulting change of slope in the inner few degrees .",
    "note also that the steep outer slope on the @xmath51 side is significantly decreased by the volume effect , and that on the @xmath52 side the outer slope is increased .",
    "the gaussian dispersions found from the longitude profile fits in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcsmoohists ] at @xmath53 are @xmath54 at @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rcsmoohists ] ) and @xmath55 at @xmath33 , compared to the average vvv values at similar longitudes and @xmath34 of @xmath56 .",
    "averaged over the model longitude profiles for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the average gaussian @xmath59 mag , corresponding to a deconvolved fwhm of 0.40 mag or a fwhm in the los density distribution of @xmath60 pc . to compare with the vvv data , we need to convolve with the stellar population broadening @xmath61 mag from section  [ ssec : modelcounts ] , and with the broadening by residual patchy extinction effects within the 3-6 subfields used for deriving the reddening map @xcite .",
    "an upper limit for the latter at @xmath34 can be estimated by comparing the width in j - k colour of the dereddened rc in a field with a@xmath62 with a nearby low - extinction field at @xmath63 .",
    "the observed difference results in @xmath64 mag ( o.  gonzalez , private communication ) , from which @xmath65 mag . adding both values in quadrature to the model @xmath66 mag predicts a total @xmath67 mag , which is close to the observed width for the vvv data , @xmath68 mag .",
    "the intrinsic rc widths of the model and of the galactic bulge as traced by the vvv rc data may therefore be quite similar . for comparison , the projected @xmath69pc .",
    "therefore , for both model and data the structure inside @xmath70 is more extended along the los than in @xmath24 .    by contrast , for the slice with @xmath71 pc shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : projections ] the change of axis ratio in the barred bulge is much less pronounced , and also the change of the major axis density slope is less pronounced . as a result , the density and rc maxima at higher latitudes lie on more nearly straight lines .",
    "barred galaxies are often characterized by a rising ellipticity profile at constant position angle , up to a maximum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for both disk- and bulge dominated galaxies @xcite .",
    "n - body models of bars have a range of morphologies ; but isodensities have not been studied extensively .",
    "some models in @xcite appear similar to the n - body model used above .",
    "2mass star count maps for the galactic bulge in the inner few degrees show a longitudinal asymmetry ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rfc08 ) which these authors interpreted as independent evidence for the possible existence of a separate nuclear bar .",
    "how does the nuclear bulge of our simulation compare to these data ?",
    "figure  [ fig : starcountmap ] shows the smoothed model star count map in @xmath72 and in the central @xmath73 . to construct this map , all particles in the simulation have been used , i.e. , possible incompletenesses in the data at the far side of the bulge are not modelled .",
    "we see that the apparent highest surface density is shifted to @xmath74 , as are the centroids of the surrounding contours .",
    "also the vertical extent of the isodensities is slightly larger on the @xmath75 side for small @xmath76 , but becomes larger on the @xmath77 side for larger @xmath76 .",
    "these asymmetries resemble those predicted by @xcite for the integrated light from the central region of an inclined triaxial bulge ; however , the star counts here are weighted by two powers of distance more than the integrated light",
    ".    the published 2mass star count maps ( * ? ? ? * rfc08 ) qualitatively show the same asymmetry pattern .",
    "the most significant difference to the model is that the innermost contours in the observed maps are significantly more flattened than the corresponding model contours .",
    "these innermost 2mass contours are possibly affected both by incompleteness ( which however would probably decrease the apparent flattening ) and by blending ( which might increase it ) .",
    "similar maps for the vvv data would therefore be very valuable .",
    "also , the model used here has a somewhat thicker disk than the milky way and , most importantly , it does not include any dissipative evolution such as gas infall and star formation on the orbits around the ilr , while such star formation is clearly on - going in inner galaxy @xcite .",
    "understanding whether the flattened component seen in the central 2mass star counts is consistent with a symmetric disk - like nuclear bulge @xcite or is related to a nuclear bar will require much more detailed data and analysis .",
    "here we merely emphasize that the asymmetry structure seen in the 2mass data is not a tell - tale evidence for such a secondary bar .",
    "we have shown that the rc maximum longitude profiles measured for @xmath34 are well - matched by an n - body model of a boxy bulge and bar which formed from a bar - unstable disk .",
    "this model is the same as in mvg11 , and we have used the same orientation and scaling to avoid parameter fitting . the change in slope of the model profiles in the inner few degrees is caused by a transition from highly elongated to nearly axisymmetric density contours around this scale .",
    "the average fwhm of the simulated rc profiles in the range @xmath70 ( @xmath78 pc at @xmath14 kpc ) is @xmath79 mag , consistent with the vvv data after convolution with estimated stellar population and patchy extinction broadening .",
    "this corresponds to a deconvolved bulge fwhm scale of @xmath60 pc along the los in this region . at higher latitudes the transition in the model isodensities weakens , predicting that the change of slope in the longitude profile disappears .",
    "the projected star count map of the model has the same asymmetry pattern as inferred previously from 2mass observations .",
    "the central surface density contours in the galactic bulge are significantly more flattened , however .",
    "this could imply the existence of a dense central disk around the location of the ilr .",
    "our results generally support the idea that the main part of the galactic bulge formed from the disk through dynamical instabilities .",
    "they also show that the evidence from star counts so far does not require a secondary nuclear bar in the milky way .",
    "we thank r.  benjamin , o.  gonzalez , d.  minniti , and m.  rejkuba for helpful discussions on asymmetries in the glimpse and vvv surveys , the anonymous referee , and the aspen center for physics for their hospitality when this work was started .",
