    "a global view of dynamical systems has been one of the leading problems considered by the dynamical systems community . based on the pioneering works of peixoto and smale ,",
    "a conjecture proposed by palis in the nineties has constituted a route guide for a global description of the space of dynamical systems .",
    "this program , that roughly describes complement of uniform hyperbolicity as the space of diffeomorphisms that are approximated by those exhibiting either homoclinic tangencies or heteroclinic cycles , has been completed with much success in the @xmath2-topology , where perturbation tools like the pugh closing lemma , franks lemma , hayashi s connecting lemma or ma ergodic closing lemma developed for the characterization of structural stability are available ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although the uniform geometric structures of invariant manifolds present in hyperbolic diffeomorphisms are a basic ingredient in achieving several core results and are quite well established , some important questions on the regularity of finer dynamical properties still remain to be answer .",
    "motivated by the analysis of the regularity of the lyapunov exponents similarly to the proof of the stability conjecture , periodic orbits and their eigenvalues should play a key role .",
    "we say that a periodic point @xmath5 of period @xmath6 for a diffeomorphism",
    "@xmath3 has _ simple spectrum _ if all the eigenvalues of @xmath7 are real and distinct .",
    "since all periodic points for an axiom a diffeomorphism , in the same basic piece , have the same index and are homoclinically related , then we will attribute them a signature , which consists of an ordered list of the dimensions of their finest dominated splittings .",
    "moreover , we will say that two periodic points @xmath8 have different signatures if the oseledets splittings for @xmath7 and @xmath9 , which consist of the finest dominated splittings at the points , are distinct .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to revisit uniformly hyperbolic basic and explore the notion of domination of oseledets splittings and characterize the continuity points of lyapunov exponent functions in this context .",
    "these results lie ultimately in the analysis of the eigenvalues and the finest dominated splitting over the periodic points .    in the first part of the paper ( see theorem  [ teo1 ] ) we prove that periodic points with simple lyapunov spectrum are dense in non - trivial basic pieces of @xmath0-residual diffeomorphisms on three - dimensional manifolds ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "in particular , any diffeomorphism with a hyperbolic basic piece can be @xmath0-approximated by a diffeomorphism with a dense set of periodic points in the continuation of the hyperbolic set .",
    "the proof of this result explores the hyperbolic structure of hyperbolic basic pieces , hence it does not rely on the classical @xmath2-perturbation lemmas .    in the case of the @xmath2-topology",
    ", one can describe the mechanisms to deduce simple lyapunov spectrum for all invariant measures assuming the same property at periodic points , in the spirit of the previous works  @xcite .",
    "on the one hand we prove that , if all periodic points of a hyperbolic basic piece for a diffeomorphism @xmath3 have simple spectrum and the same property holds in a @xmath2 neighborhood of @xmath3 ( c.f . definition  [ def : simplestar ] ) then @xmath3 has a finest dominated splitting into one - dimensional sub - bundles ( see theorem  [ thm:1fds ] ) . in this case",
    "all lyapunov exponent functions of @xmath3 are continuous in the weak@xmath4-topology .",
    "on the other hand , if periodic points miss to have simple spectrum robustly , then , by a @xmath2-arbitrarily small perturbation , one can create an equidimensional cycle associated to a pair of periodic points which robustly exhibit different signatures ( see theorem  [ thm : dichotomy ] ) .",
    "finally , we justify that these equidimensional cycles associated to periodic points with different signatures play a similar role to the one of tangencies and heterodimensional cycles by its instability character .",
    "in fact , the existence of homoclinic tangencies or heterodimensional cycles is often associated to the so - called newhouse phenomenon of persistence of infinitely many sources or sinks ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . in this",
    "setting , the existence of a equidimensional cycle associated to periodic points with different signatures can be used to generate ( by perturbation ) infinitely many periodic points with any of the signatures of the generating periodic orbits ( see theorem  [ thm : explo ] ) . using the existence of markov partitions",
    "we deduce that similar results hold in the time - continuous setting ( see corollary  [ cor : flows ] ) .",

    "it is clear from the previous definition that having a one - dimensional finest dominated splitting is a @xmath2-open condition for @xmath0-diffeomorphisms @xmath54 .",
    "since dominated splittings vary continuously with the base point on a basic set @xmath15 , if the diffeomorphism @xmath3 has a one - dimensional finest dominated splitting @xmath55 then there exists a continuous function @xmath56 such that @xmath57 for every @xmath58 and @xmath21 and , consequently , the limit superior @xmath59 is everywhere well defined and it does not depend on the choice of the vector @xmath60 . defining @xmath61 and @xmath62 by @xmath63",
    "then it follows that each value @xmath64 can be written as @xmath65 using  , for any @xmath3-invariant and ergodic probability measure @xmath36 each of the values @xmath64 coincide @xmath36-almost everywhere coincide with the lyapunov exponents @xmath41 , for every @xmath58 .",
    "more generally , for any @xmath3-invariant probability measure @xmath36 we define their _ lyapunov exponents _ by @xmath66 for every @xmath58 .",
