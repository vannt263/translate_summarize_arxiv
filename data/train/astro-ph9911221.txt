    "full details of the observing hardware and analysis procedures are available in edwards et al .",
    "briefly , 265-s pointed observations were made with the 64-m parkes radiotelescope using the sensitive new 21 cm 13-beam receiver .",
    "the backend system includes twenty - six filterbanks , each with ninety - six channels and a total bandwidth of 288 mhz , centred at a sky frequency of 1374 mhz .",
    "detected filterbank outputs are summed in polarisation pairs and one - bit digitised with an integration time of 125 @xmath6s .",
    "data is recorded on magnetic tape for offline processing on the swinburne supercluster , a network of 64 compaq alpha workstations , using standard techniques ( e.g. manchester et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the survey area has been observed and processed to a completeness of 90% and has been highly successful with a minimal investment of telescope time , discovering 58 new pulsars to date . of these ,",
    "eight are recycled , six of which are in binary systems with circular orbits , indicating white dwarf companions .",
    "we have discovered a pulsar with a period of 278 ms and an average pulse profile only @xmath7 fwhm .",
    "rankin ( 1990 ) observed that the distribution of pulsar profile widths for core - type pulsars is well fit by the constraint @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the pulsar period in seconds .",
    "the newly discovered pulsar j14107407 , however , has @xmath10 .",
    "preliminary polarimetric results at 660 mhz and 1400 mhz indicate that the profile has two components , furthering the discrepancy between the observed component widths of this pulsar and other long - period systems .",
    "the orbital period distribution of low mass binary pulsars previously appeared to include a `` gap '' ( camilo 1994 ) in the range @xmath11 .",
    "a number of authors ( e.g. kulkarni 1995 , tauris 1996 ) have suggested that this gap separates those systems that evolved with significant angular momentum losses from those that did not .",
    "systems with an orbital period less than the so - called `` bifurcation period '' , @xmath12=12 days , undergo orbital contraction during mass transfer due these losses . the newly discovered binary system j16183919@xmath13 has an orbital period of 23.3 days , placing it in the middle of the `` gap '' .",
    "further to the considerations above , we suggest that there is a narrow range of initial orbital periods ( significantly longer than @xmath12 ) over which ( for increasingly close orbits ) angular momentum losses quickly become significant .",
    "this results in an under - density of systems with final orbits in the range of 7  60 days , particularly around the upper end of this range ( the former `` gap '' ) .",
    "the distribution around @xmath12 appears fairly even .",
    "the mass functions of two of the new recycled binary systems indicate that the companion is a massive co or onemg white dwarf  for j17575322 @xmath14 , whilst for j11575112 @xmath15 .",
    "five recycled binary pulsars with massive white dwarfs were previously known ( see e.g. arzoumanian , cordes & wasserman 1999 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the evolution of these systems included a deep common envelope phase ( van den heuvel 1994 ) .",
    "psr j17575322 is in a very close 11-hour orbit ( with an orbital separation of @xmath16 ) and may be explained by this model only if an energy source other than orbital decay largely powers envelope ejection .",
    "j11575112 , on the other hand , is only marginally compatible with the model of van den heuvel ( 1994 ) due to the relatively wide 3.5-day orbit ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "i thank the galactic plane multibeam pulsar survey collaboration ( see camilo et al .",
