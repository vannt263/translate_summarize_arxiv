    "a * symplectic toric manifold ( orbifold ) * is a symplectic manifold ( orbifold ) @xmath0 equipped with an effective hamiltonian action of a torus @xmath1 , with @xmath2 .",
    "each symplectic toric orbifold has an associated moment map , @xmath3 , to the dual of the lie algebra of @xmath1 , which is unique up to translation .",
    "if @xmath4 is compact then the image of @xmath5 is a compact convex polytope in @xmath6 , the convex hull of the images of the fixed points of the action ( atiyah @xcite , guillemin , sternberg @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the polytope is delzant , i.e. it is simple , rational and smooth ( see section [ section shrinking ] for precise definitions ) .",
    "delzant in @xcite proved that compact symplectic toric manifolds , up to equivariant symplectomorphism ( definition in section [ section shrinking ] ) , are classified by their moment map images , up to translation in @xmath7 . in the proof he uses the data encoded in the moment polytope to show that every such manifold can be obtained from @xmath8 , with the standard symplectic structure , by a symplectic reduction ( for some @xmath9 ) .",
    "this result was generalized to compact symplectic toric orbifolds by lerman and tolman @xcite .",
    "compact symplectic toric orbifolds ( up to equivariant symplectomorphism ) can be classified by compact , convex , rational and simple polytopes ( not necessarily smooth ) with positive integers attached to each facet ( up to translation , keeping labels fixed ) .",
    "we will call a convex rational polytope with positive integer labels attached to each facet a * labeled polytope*. compact symplectic toric orbifolds are also symplectic reductions of @xmath8 .    thanks to the above correspondence between labeled polytopes and symplectic toric orbifolds we can study the combinatorial properties of polytopes in order to obtain some geometric information about the associated toric orbifolds . note that @xmath10 is isomorphic ( though not canonically ) to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the dimension of @xmath1 . in",
    "section [ section shrinking ] we specify an identification of @xmath10 with @xmath13 that we use throughout the paper .",
    "this allows us to think about @xmath14 as a subset of @xmath13 .",
    "every convex rational polytope is an intersection of some number of half spaces , and it can be uniquely written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of facets , @xmath17 are real numbers , and the vectors @xmath18 are primitive outward normals to the facets of the polytope .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the standard inner product .",
    "moreover , if @xmath20 is a labeled polytope , then the labels @xmath21 can be incorporated in the description of the polytope by presenting the above half spaces as @xmath22 .",
    "hence , every convex rational labeled polytope can be uniquely presented as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the primitive outward normal , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the label on the corresponding facet .",
    "therefore the polytope has a trivial labeling ( all labels equal to @xmath28 ) if and only if all the @xmath29 s are primitive .",
    "we say that a labeled polytope is * monotone * if @xmath30 for every @xmath31 note that changing the labels may change monotonicity ( see figure [ figurezeroexample ] ) .    in section [ section shrinking ] , motivated by the work of reid @xcite and the toric minimal model program of gonzales and woodward @xcite , we define a procedure of shrinking a labeled polytope @xmath32 to a point .",
    "the idea is to move each facet of @xmath20 inward by reducing each @xmath33 by the same amount . as a result",
    "we either get a point or a lower dimensional polytope . in the second case",
    "we carry on shrinking this lower dimensional polytope , and continue till we get to a point .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the number of `` dimension drops '' that occur while shrinking . the lagrangian torus fiber which is the preimage ( under the moment map ) of the final point of the shrinking procedure",
    "is called the * central fiber*. note that this definition does not depend on the choice of identification @xmath35 .",
    "if this final point is the origin , the polytope is called * centered at the origin*. note that every monotone polytope is centered at the origin and that any polytope can be made centered at the origin by an appropriate translation ( adding a constant to the chosen moment map ) .",
    "thus we will always assume that the moment map image @xmath36 is a polytope centered at the origin . with this assumption",
    "the central fiber is @xmath37 , the preimage of the origin @xmath38 .",
    "we are ready to state the first theorem .",
    "[ prva ] every ( compact , convex , rational ) centered at the origin , labeled polytope is an intersection of ( compact , convex , rational ) monotone labeled polytopes in one of the following ways : @xmath39 if @xmath40 or @xmath41 if @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , for every @xmath44 and @xmath45 for every @xmath46 .",
    "we obtain the information needed to construct the polytopes @xmath47 in theorem [ prva ] by analyzing how the face structure of @xmath20 changes while shrinking .",
    "@xmath20 being smooth or simple does not imply that the polytopes on the right hand side of and are either smooth or simple .",
    "see examples [ inter.newfirstexample ] and [ inter.verynewfirst ] .    in our next result",
    "we use purely combinatorial theorem [ prva ] to present each symplectic toric orbifold as a  centered \" reduction of a product of weighted projective spaces , as we now explain .",
    "a weighted projective space @xmath48 , with @xmath49 coprime , is a toric symplectic orbifold that is a symplectic reduction of @xmath50 with respect to a circle action : @xmath51 there is a toric @xmath52 action on @xmath48 , namely the residual action coming from the standard @xmath53action on @xmath54 when at least one of the weights @xmath55 is equal to 1 ( say @xmath56 ) , then the corresponding polytope ( centered at the origin ) is @xmath57 where @xmath58 are coordinate vectors and @xmath59 is a positive real number responsible for rescaling the symplectic form .",

    "any symplectic toric orbifold can be presented as a symplectic reduction of one weighted projective space , but this reduction is not necessarily centered ( see proposition [ mon.symp.red ] ) .",
    "it is worth looking for a centered reduction because often important symplectic information , for example , non - displaceability ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.4(i ) ) ) , or quasimorphisms ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) ) , is preserved under centered reduction .",
    "our second result is the following .",
    "[ druga ] every compact symplectic toric orbifold is a centered reduction of a cartesian product of weighted projective spaces .",
    "the idea of the proof is to use the presentation of the corresponding labeled polytope described in theorem [ prva ]",
    ". the number of monotone polytopes in the presentation will be the number of weighted projective spaces in the cartesian product .",
    "we use a centered reduction as a tool to prove the existence of a non - displaceable torus fiber in a reduced space .",
    "a lagrangian submanifold @xmath63 in a symplectic manifold @xmath4 is * non - displaceable * if for every hamiltonian diffeomorphism @xmath64 we have @xmath65 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.4(i ) ) , abreu and macarini prove that if @xmath4 is a symplectic reduction @xmath66 and @xmath67 contains a non - displaceable @xmath68-invariant set then the image of this non - displaceable set is non - displaceable in the reduced space @xmath4 .",
    "the central fiber of the cartesian product of weighted projective spaces is non - displaceable ( @xcite , @xcite ; see also section [ non - displ ] ) .",
    "therefore we obtain the following result .",
    "[ posled1 ] for every compact symplectic toric orbifold its central fiber is non - displaceable .",
    "the above fact is already known ( see the works of fukaya - oh - ohta - ono @xcite , @xcite using vanishing of lagrangian floer cohomology , and the works of e. gonzales and c. woodward @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , using quasimap floer cohomology ) .",
    "our proof of theorem [ posled1 ] does not involve any calculation in floer cohomology ( though it uses the non - trivial fact that the central torus fiber of a weighted projective space is non - displaceable ) .",
    "we finish the paper with another application of theorem [ prva ] .",
    "combinatorial analysis of the moment polytopes of symplectic toric manifolds , done in the proof of theorem [ prva ] , allows us to give some lower and upper bounds on the gromov width of these manifolds ( see section [ section gromovwidth ] for precise definitions and results ) .",
