    "mergers and interactions are believed to be among the primary pathways for galaxy formation and evolution : they are expected to drive star formation histories , morphologies , internal kinematics , chemical evolution and nuclear activity , among others , and reflect a long history of processing through different environments .",
    "the merger rate of galaxies , its evolution and its dependence on mass , luminosity , colour , morphology and environment ( to name some ) provide important clues to theories of galaxy formation and are an essential ingredient in simulations ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    however , it is actually difficult to estimate the galaxy merger rate and compare with theoretical estimates ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "several approaches have been applied to astronomical data and these often yield inconsistent results .",
    "tidal features and sheets were early recognized by @xcite as signposts of galaxy interactions , following the pioneering opto - mechanical experiments by @xcite .",
    "seminal work by @xcite and @xcite later established a connection between tidal disturbances and mergers , leading to a semi - empirical model for the formation of giant ellipticals from the merger of disks in the context of early cold dark matter models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more recent applications of this technique rely on objective measures of morphological anomaly in galaxy images , rather than visual classifications , such as the gini coefficient @xcite , @xmath11 index @xcite and the cas method of @xcite and fourier - mode asymmetry measurements @xcite .",
    "a companion paper by @xcite also gives details on the application of cas - like approaches to the gama survey .",
    "if a galaxy is to merge , it needs a close companion to merge with .",
    "the fraction of galaxies in close pairs therefore yields a proxy for the galaxy merger rate . with the availability of large redshift databases from giant redshift surveys it is now possible to identify close pairs in 3d space ( position and relative velocity ) , such that , if bound , these galaxies will merge within the dynamical friction timescale ( @xmath12 gyr ) .",
    "the formalism and its application to the ssrs2 and cfrs surveys have been presented in @xcite ; we have used this method to measure the local pair fraction and merger rate from the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ; @xcite ) in @xcite , where we also compared the results to asymmetry - based estimates @xcite .",
    "several other studies have searched for dynamically close pairs out to @xmath13 ( e.g. @xcite _ et seq . _ ) .",
    "both methods have their own strengths and weaknesses .",
    "morphology - based approaches require high resolution , high - quality imaging and careful attention needs to be paid to contamination ( e.g. , edge - on galaxies , segmentation ",
    "dynamically close pairs are observationally expensive as highly complete redshift samples need to be acquired and they are still affected by projection effects @xcite .",
    "both approaches are also affected by uncertain timescales for the close pairs to merge or the visibility of merger remnants above a given level of asymmetry or disturbance ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the two methods yield results in reasonable agreement @xcite , with each other , asymmetries and other morphology - based methods generally identify objects in the process of merging or recent merger remnants , while close pairs yield a measure of the progenitor rate and may be more easily compared to theoretical predictions by identifying close pairs of dark matter halos in simulations @xcite as long as one understands the assumptions about the correspondence between dark matter halos and visible galaxies .    here",
    "we present a search for close pairs in the gama survey @xcite .",
    "this dataset is ideal for this measurement , as the survey has very high completeness ( @xmath14 ) and no bias against close companions ( for instance , the fibre placement algorithm in the sdss leads to incompleteness at separations of @xmath15 and in the 2df survey the close separation limit is about @xmath16 ) .",
    "we measure the pair fraction and volume merger rate as a function of absolute luminosity .",
    "we also split our samples into dry ( between quiescent / spheroid - dominated galaxies ) , wet ( star forming or disk - dominated objects ) and damp ( mixed ) mergers and we consider their dependence on luminosity ; we also measure the cosmic variance of the pair fraction and merger rate .",
    "we study the properties of galaxies in pairs and compare these ( colours , morphologies , environment and activity ) with those of more isolated objects ( i.e.,not in our close pairs ) in the same volume and with the same luminosity , to understand how interactions have affected galaxies .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : we discuss the dataset and the methodology in section 2 .",
    "we then present the pair fractions in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we consider the properties of galaxies in pairs vs. their parent samples . finally ,",
    "in section 5 , we discuss the results in the context of theories of galaxy formation . throughout this paper",
    "we assume the standard @xmath17cdm cosmology with @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "the dataset we use is the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) redshift survey .",
    "this is fully described in driver et al .",
    "( 2011 , see @xcite for the input catalogue and @xcite for details of the spectroscopic analysis ) ; in the following , we give a brief summary of its main properties as used in this paper .",
    "gama as used in this paper is equivalent to the gama - i sample obtained during the first 3 years of the survey and frozen for internal team use and consists of three 48 deg@xmath18 regions on the celestial equator , at ra of 9h , 12h and 14.5h , containing photometry over a wide range of wavelengths , including vacuum uv from galex , @xmath19 from the sdss @xcite , @xmath20 from 2mass and ukidss , mid - ir from the wise survey at 3.6 , 4.5 , 12 and 22 @xmath21 m , as well as other sources of archival photometry ( e.g. , herschel , planck ) .",
    "spectroscopy to a limiting magnitude of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 for the 12h region ) has been obtained for over 120,000 galaxies with the aaomega multi - fibre spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope , supplementing existing datasets from the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite , the sdss and others , to reach a high degree ( @xmath24 ) of spectroscopic completeness @xcite .",
    "each region in the sky is surveyed multiple times , which aids in reaching high completeness at small angular separations .",
    "because of this , gama is ideal to carry out a close pair analysis of galaxy populations to measure the merger rate and explore the influence of interactions and mergers on galaxy properties .",
    "we search for pairs in gama using the methods developed by @xcite and used in our previous work on the subject @xcite .",
    "following previous studies , we define galaxies as being in a close pair if their projected separation on the sky is @xmath25 kpc ( the lower limit is imposed to avoid selecting high surface brightness regions within galaxies , such as hii regions ) and if their velocity difference is @xmath26 km s@xmath4 . if these objects are truly bound , we expect that they will merge , by dynamical friction in @xmath27 gyr ( the actual timescales are likely to be somewhat longer , see below for details ) .     and @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the two redshift intervals are chosen to yield approximately equal volumes .",
    "the red box is for galaxies with @xmath30 at @xmath31 ; the green box is for galaxies with @xmath32 at @xmath33 and the blue box is for galaxies with @xmath34 at @xmath35 .",
    "the thick red line shows the predicted absolute magnitude for a slowly evolving galaxy ( discussed in text ) having @xmath22 at @xmath36 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    fig .",
    "1 shows the absolute magnitude of galaxies in gama ( only a subset is shown for clarity ) as a function of redshift . here ,",
    "all magnitudes and @xmath37 corrections are as given in the gama - i catalogue @xcite .",
    "the first step in our analysis is to select galaxies within a series of volume - limited boxes in absolute magnitude and redshift space . in order to measure a pair fraction",
    ", we need to restrict ourselves to a relatively small range of luminosities , as we need objects to have similar clustering properties @xcite and the clustering length is known to vary as a function of galaxy luminosity @xcite .",
    "however , we also need our samples to contain enough galaxies to determine the pair fraction to sufficient accuracy , given that only @xmath38 of galaxies ( based on previous work ) are likely to fulfil our definition of a close pair . as in @xcite",
    ", we draw volume - limited samples spanning 3 mag . in luminosity ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "potentially , this includes mergers with luminosity ratios of up to 1:10 , but the majority of close pairs will have luminosity ratios of @xmath39 and are therefore ` major ' mergers ( see below ) .",
    "table  1 shows the luminosity and redshift ranges we study in this work , as well as the numbers of objects in each volume - limited box and the number of galaxies in close pairs ( this need not be an even number , because of possible triplets ) .",
    "note that for the brighter luminosity bin we consider , we are able to draw two samples , at @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and study the evolution of the merger rate between these two redshifts for galaxies with @xmath9 .    because our sample ( like all samples ) is luminosity - limited we need to impose a lower absolute magnitude limit to our search , rather than using all galaxies in the appropriate luminosity range .",
    "this corresponds to the luminosity of a slowly evolving galaxy having the apparent magnitude limit of the survey ( @xmath22 ) at all redshifts considered ( thick red line in fig .  1 ) .",
    "if this is not done , it is possible for galaxies to enter or leave the sample depending on their star formation history @xcite .",
    "we use a @xcite model with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 gyr , evolving passively , as a template for the slowest evolving object we are likely to encounter . when drawing the volume - limited boxes shown in fig .  1",
    ", this model sets the high redshift limit for each luminosity interval we examine .",
    "each pair consists of a primary and secondary member ; in this case we choose to make the two samples coincide so each galaxy is counted twice , once as a central and next as a satellite of the other .",
    "following @xcite and our previous work , the number of close companions per galaxy is :    @xmath45    where the sums are over the @xmath46 galaxies in the primary sample , and the total companion luminosity is :    @xmath47    here @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the number and luminosity ( respectively ) of galaxies in the secondary sample which are close companions ( by the above definition ) to the @xmath50 galaxy in the primary sample :    @xmath51    and    @xmath52    where the sums run over the @xmath53 secondary galaxies that fulfil the criteria of being dynamically close to the @xmath50 primary galaxy .",
    "the raw pair fractions are then weighted to correct for sources of spatial and spectroscopic incompleteness ( e.g. , areas where no fibers were placed such as within the halos of bright stars , or limits to slit placement for close companions ) .",
    "the components @xmath54 and @xmath55 are weights to correct for the change in density of the secondary galaxies as a function of redshift due to the apparent flux limit of the sample and convert a luminosity limited sample into what would be expected from a volume - limited sample .",
    "they are calculated as the ratio of the integrated luminosity function over the luminosity sampled to the integrated luminosity function in a hypothetical volume - limited sample over the same redshift . in our case , as we are using volume - limited subsets of the data ( see figure 1 ) , these components are equal to 1 ( no weight ) .    the other two weights , @xmath56 and @xmath57 correct for boundary effects .",
    "the first one takes care of areas ( within the search radius ) around each galaxy where no companion can be found because they lie beyond the edges of the survey on the sky or within areas occulted by bright stars , ` drill holes ' ( for guide probes ) , image defects and satellite trails or other cosmetic issues .",
    "this weight is the reciprocal of the fraction of the @xmath58 area around each galaxy which is occulted in some fashion .",
    "the second weight is for galaxies close ( within 500 km s@xmath4 ) to the redshift limits of each volume - limited box , and accounts for possible companions missed because they lie just beyond these boundaries . as in @xcite the value of this weight",
    "is set at 2 .",
    "similar weights need to be applied to the primary sample as well , to account for missed primaries in the same manner ( recall that both primary and secondary samples are the same ) :    @xmath59    @xmath60    these weights being the reciprocals of those applied to the secondary sample @xmath61 , @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "although gama is highly complete and is intended to have no pair bias at close angular separations , we need to correct for potential pairs missed because of redshift incompleteness , especially at small separations .",
    "we carry this out in the following manner : we first select potential pairs with galaxies that have no redshifts by the projected separation criterion only , and if such a pair exists , we assign to the galaxy the same redshift and @xmath37 corrections as its primary and require that the secondary galaxy falls within the selection criteria in luminosity .",
    "we then estimate the fraction of true pairs in this sample by carrying out the same analysis on the photometric sample ( only ) and on the redshift sample ( only ) separately , by using only the projected separation criterion .",
    "since we know the true pair fraction in the redshift sample , we can use the ratio between the pair fractions in the photometric and redshift samples to derive an incompleteness correction .",
    "this is similar to the approach used by @xcite for the mgc and by @xcite .",
    "naturally , this assumes that pairs are missed in a random fashion and potential companions have the same redshift distributions as the overall gama survey .",
    "this completeness correction amounts to @xmath63 to @xmath64 between @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , with some increase towards lower luminosities , in agreement with gama s high overall completeness and broad lack of bias at small separations .",
    "an alternative approach is to select galaxies by stellar mass rather than luminosity . for the gama dataset the galaxy stellar mass was calculated by @xcite who gives a formula involving their absolute @xmath67-band luminosity and rest - frame @xmath68 colour",
    "however , this is found to reject a significant fraction of the sample , as the stellar mass determinations are model - dependent ( cf . the equivalent figure in robotham et al .",
    "( 2014 , submitted to mnras ) .",
    "our aim in this paper is not only to measure the pair fraction and derived merger rate , but also to consider how these quantities depend on luminosity , morphology , colour and environment and on how the properties of galaxies in pairs compare to those of more isolated systems in the same volume",
    ". therefore we will restrict ourself to the numerically larger luminosity - selected samples .",
    "a pair analysis of gama data by stellar mass can be found in the companion paper by robotham et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , where some of the selection issues are addressed with reference to simulations and mock catalogues .",
    "nevertheless , this latter analysis does not concern itself with the dependencies on luminosity , colour , morphology and environment which are among the topics explored here .",
    "table 1 shows the main results of our analysis . in column order ,",
    "the table contains : the luminosity ranges , redshift ranges , number of galaxies in each volume - limited box and number of close pairs , the completeness corrected pair fractions and the volume merger rates . in general , these objects are major mergers . around 2/3 of all objects , in all the samples considered , have luminosity ratios of 1:2 or greater , and about 20% have luminosity ratios between 1:2 and 1:4 .

    "we also tabulate separate results for the samples at @xmath69 and at @xmath41 ( but note that as in the previous figure we do not show this datapoint in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] to avoid confusion ) .",
    "we observe dry mergers to be rare in our most luminous sample at @xmath70 , in agreement with previous results by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dry merger rate also decreases monotonically as a function of luminosity .",
    "there are very few faint dry mergers .",
    "it appears therefore unlikely that the red sequence can be built by this process at least since @xmath10 as probed in this study .",
    "most mergers at the faint end are wet and their relative contribution increases with decreasing @xmath71 .",
    "damp mergers are intermediate between the behaviour of red and blue pairs .",
    "this is true for samples selected by colour or srsic index .",
    "the intermediate behaviour of damp mergers suggests that galaxies in pairs are selected almost at random from the parent population and therefore that presence in a close pair does not strongly affect the properties of the galaxies .",
    "we will examine this in greater detail below . in the brightest luminosity bin we also find evidence of only flat evolution in the merger rate , irrespective of colour or morphology , since @xmath10 , suggesting that there has been no change in the makeup of merging pairs ( at least for massive galaxies ) over the last @xmath72 gyr of the history of the universe .          as gama",

    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] for the full sample as well as for dry , wet and damp mergers ( by colour and morphology ) .",
    "we have applied small shifts in luminosity in this figure for reasons of clarity .",
    "the cosmic variance over volumes of @xmath73 @xmath74 mpc@xmath75 is approximately a factor of 2 , in reasonable agreement with the estimate by @xcite from the alhambra survey .",
    "we now compare the properties of galaxies in pairs ( colour , morphology , environmental density and degree of activity , such as star formation or agns , measured from the bpt index of @xcite ) to those of more isolated ( i.e. , not in close pairs ) galaxies in the volume - limited region from which the pairs are drawn .",
    "we divide all galaxies into bins of colour , morphology , environmental density and bpt class and compute the fractions of galaxies in each bin , for objects in close pairs and for their parent sample ( more isolated systems ) in the same volume .",
    "we then calculate the fractional difference ( pairs  parent sample ) in each colour ( morphology , environment , bpt class ) bin .",
    "a negative value means that there is a relative deficit of galaxies in close pairs in the appropriate colour ( morphology , etc . )",

    "we can asses how membership in a close pair and the on - going interaction affects the properties of galaxies ( relative to similar objects in the same volume ) .",
    "we show the results of this analysis in fig .",
    "58 below .",
    "the colour distribution of galaxies is bimodal , as is well - known @xcite , with red galaxies becoming more prominent in the higher luminosity bins . in all cases , except the faintest luminosity range where most galaxies are blue",
    ", we note that pairs are overrepresented in the red peak and less frequent in the blue peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) .",
    "this argues that presence in a close pair does not trigger but rather tends to quench star formation .",
    "similar claims of a greater frequency of red galaxies in pairs were earlier reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite also find that close pairs tend to quench , and not enhance , star formation in their sample .",
    "@xcite argued that there is only a modest enhancement in star formation rates for a sample of highly interacting objects . in our previous study of pairs in the mgc",
    "@xcite we noticed a similar excess of red pairs , as well as an excess of blue pairs ( and a deficit of green valley systems in pairs ) , which is not seen here .",
    "@xcite suggest that the apparent increase in the fraction of blue galaxies in pairs in some previous studies may be due to greater visibility of gas - rich , star - forming objects , especially if pairs and mergers are selected by morphology .",
    "the distribution of srsic indices shows a deficit of disky galaxies among pairs , and a slight excess of more spheroid - dominated objects .",
    "this may imply a degree of morphological evolution as part of the merger process .",
    "we found a similar trend in mgc data @xcite with an excess of e / s0 and sc / sd galaxies in pairs compared to the mgc sample , and a deficit of intermediate spirals ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we also concluded ( as do @xcite ) that this is due to a combination of morphological evolution and induced star formation .",
    "most of these changes ( in colour and morphology ) appear to take place close to the transition colour of @xmath76 or srsic index of @xmath77 .",
    "this may indicate that mergers and interactions do not cause abrupt changes in star formation rates or morphologies , but might simply accelerate or enhance an on - going process of secular evolution ( as in the harassment scenario by @xcite ) .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that environment plays a role .",
    "@xcite notes a similar trend of increasing spheroid fractions among galaxies in pairs and attributes it to the denser environments in which pairs may reside , yielding larger spheroids because of the morphology - density relation .",
    "@xcite use a volume - limited sample in the sdss and reach similar conclusions .",
    "we therefore look at the environmental density of galaxies in pairs vs. other ( more isolated ) galaxies in the same volume . here",
    ", environmental density is defined using an index developed by @xcite who use the distance to the @xmath78 nearest neighbour within 1000 km s@xmath4 and which is believed to provide a halo - independent measure of the environment of galaxies ; this is more appropriate to our purposes ( and less model - dependent ) as we are chiefly interested in exploring whether differences in colour or morphology can be attributed to environmental effects .",
    "we derive this index from our gama data by applying the recipe of @xcite : a shorter distance ( i.e. , closer 7@xmath79 neighbour ) implies a denser environment and vice - versa ( higher value of this index implies a less dense environment ) . generally , gama samples a variety of environments , but most galaxies lie in the field or groups , with only one large cluster known in the gama fields .",
    "we show the fractional difference of galaxies ( in pairs minus all other objects not in close pairs , as with previous figures ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] .",
    "this does not support the hypothesis that galaxy pairs reside in more dense environments , in agreement with previous work by @xcite and @xcite that finds only a weak environmental dependence in the sdss pairs ( but see @xcite , who find a much stronger environmental trend , although this is at @xmath80 in the cosmos field ) .",
    "the weak environmental dependence is somewhat surprising as simulations indicate a much stronger effect of environmental density than here observed @xcite .",
    "finally we consider the bpt diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] to measure the degree of activity in galaxies in pairs and their parent sample .",
    "this classifies all emission - line galaxies as star - forming , seyfert , liner , composite spectra between liner and seyfert or between star forming and seyfert ( here termed composite ) on the basis of emission line intensity ratios .",
    "we use the classification of @xcite and @xcite as applied to sdss dr8 ( and later releases ) data by @xcite .",
    "this is only a subset of all data in the gama survey but it includes about 1/3 of all galaxies in our sample and there is no apparent bias towards or against galaxies in pairs . in agreement with the relative weakness of the blue peak in the colour distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , we find a smaller fraction of active star - forming galaxies among pairs , but it is surprising to see that there is little or no evidence of increased agn activity among galaxies in pairs compared to the volume - limited parent sample of objects . in all magnitude ranges we consider , there are fewer seyfert or composite ( liner+seyfert or star forming+seyfert ) objects in the pairs sample , while liners are only marginally more common .",
    "we have measured pair fractions and merger rates for galaxies in the gama survey , with @xmath81 in a series of volume - limited samples and explored how the merger rate varies with luminosity , colour or morphology .",
    "we then considered how the properties of galaxies in close pairs ( colour , morphology , environmental density and bpt class ) compare to those of more isolated objects in the same volume to understand how galaxies are affected by mergers and interactions .",
    "the merger fractions for galaxies in the gama survey are ( assuming that 50% of mergers are dynamically bound ) @xmath82 almost irrespective of luminosity .",
    "these are generally in good agreement with previous estimates of the pair fraction and merger rates in the local universe , as well as with the well - known flat evolution out to high redshift , as in the compilation by @xcite .",
    "our previous local ( @xmath83 ) estimate of the merger rate from the mgc @xcite is in good agreement with that presented here , although it concerns galaxies with @xmath84 . @xcite",
    "give @xmath85 but for galaxies with @xmath86 and only for pairs with luminosity ratios 1:2 or better , compared to our @xmath87 for galaxies with @xmath88 .",
    "however , although the pair fraction does not change strongly across this luminosity range , we include more minor mergers are well .",
    "approximately 1/2 of our mergers have luminosity ratios of @xmath89 , which brings the pair fractions into agreement .",
    "comparison of the actual volume merger rates requires understanding assumptions concerning the space density of galaxies and assumed merger timescales , which are not fully transparent .",
    "finally , the lower redshift points of @xcite and @xcite are reasonably close to our values , despite the somewhat different selection criteria in each case .",
    "the volume merger rates are seen to decrease significantly at both high and low luminosities in our sample . given the measured accretion rates and evolution of the merger rate , we estimate that the total stellar mass growth ( given the luminosity accretion rates and reasonable mass to light ratios ) of galaxies in the past 1/2 of the hubble time due to mergers lies in the range of 10% to 30% .",
    "this assumes merger timescales as discussed above , a 50% true merger fraction and the flat evolution of the merger rate found in this work to @xmath10 and measured to @xmath90 by other studies ( e.g. , @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate a similar @xmath91 for the growth rate of galaxies since @xmath13 .",
    "however , these tend to be more massive than the gama sample which is generally between @xmath92 .",
    "the trend of merger rates with luminosity and redshift is instead not in good agreement with predictions from dark matter simulations such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is significantly lower than estimates of the mass growth of galactic halos in simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which on average double the mass of galaxies since @xmath13 .",
    "the discrepancy may be reduced if the merger rate evolution with redshift is faster but our data for the brighter galaxies are consistent with a flat or declining evolution since @xmath93 , irrespective of colour or morphological type , as previously observed for similarly luminous galaxies at higher redshifts by @xcite and @xcite . in the compilation of @xcite ,",
    "the merger rate evolves as @xmath94 for luminosity ( or mass ) selected samples , in agreement with very slow growth rates by major merging for massive galaxies .",
    "robotham et al .",
    "( 2014 , mnras submitted ) also find that the evolution of the merger rate is close to flat .",
    "our data allow us to consider the local dry , wet and damp merger rate .",
    "dry mergers ( between either red or spheroid - dominated galaxies ) are observed to be rare in the local universe , in agreement with several previous studies @xcite , while we also observe that dry mergers are less frequent as a function of decreasing luminosity .",
    "we find evidence of slow evolution for at least the more massive ( luminous ) systems . in our close pair study of luminous red galaxies at @xmath95",
    "we measured a stringent upper limit of @xmath96 per gyr , which is consistent with flat evolution of the dry merger rate out to at least @xmath97 .",
    "@xcite also confirm the slow growth of the dry merger rate as a function of redshift out to @xmath98 .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the red sequence is formed by dry mergers at least in the past 1/3 of the hubble time .",
    "most mergers between lower luminosity galaxies are instead wet ( and the rate increases towards lower luminosities ) while damp mergers are intermediate .    when we compare the colour distribution of galaxies in pairs with that of galaxies in their volume - limited parent sample , we observe a deficit of blue objects and an excess of red galaxies .",
    "this argues for suppression of star formation in galaxy pairs , as noted earlier by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat surprising in the light of theoretical expectations that mergers and interactions boost the star formation and activity rates ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we confirm this from our analysis of bpt classes where there is a lower fraction of star - forming galaxies among close pairs compared to galaxies in the same volume .",
    "@xcite found only a modest degree of enhancement of star formation for interacting pairs , contributing little to the luminosity ; @xcite also find only a modest enhancement of star formation in galaxy pairs in a wide range of merger stages ; @xcite instead find that the enhancement in star formation , in a sample of star - forming galaxies , increases with decreasing separation but does not depend on the luminosity ratio , although it is stronger for lower - mass galaxies ; for massive galaxies , @xcite find that only 10% of star formation is due to major interactions ( albeit at higher redshifts than studied here ) ; @xcite also detect an excess of red galaxies in pairs and attribute this to denser environments and hence more significant spheroids ( because of the morphology - density relation ) ; @xcite confirm that most close pairs are red and not blue ; @xcite also finds evidence that interactions are not generally responsible for star formation bursts in two volume - limited samples drawn from the sdss ; @xcite study star formation for galaxies in groups and claim that galaxies with a close neighbour have lower star formation rates .",
    "similarly , we find that , by comparing the distributions of srsic indices for galaxies in pairs and their parent samples , there is a relative lack of disks and excess of spheroids among paired galaxies as in @xcite .",
    "spheroids are generally associated with suppression of star formation , but it is not clear whether this a cause or an effect @xcite . if pairs lie in more dense environments , they will contain more prominent spheroids ( by the standard morphology - density relation ) and therefore have lower star formation rates ( as suggested by @xcite , explaining the excess of red galaxies among pairs found above .",
    "however , in our sample , we do not find that galaxies in pairs lie in significantly different environments ( as do @xcite and @xcite who find only a mild environmental dependence ) .",
    "this suggests a degree of morphological evolution is also associated with star formation suppression in these objects .",
    "@xcite show that tidal interactions may indeed cause an increase in galaxy concentration , which is an indicator of more significant spheroids .",
    "however , this is not due to the fact that the galaxies lie in more dense environments and are more spheroid - dominated ( and therefore more quiescent ) .",
    "rather , it appears that the extra spheroid light is related to the suppression of star formation and presence in a close pair , although it is not possible to determine from the present sample whether quenching or morphological evolution occur first @xcite .",
    "one mechanism by which we may explain these findings is ` harassment ' @xcite .",
    "galaxies in these close pairs are likely to have undergone a series of previous encounters and close passes ; @xcite argues that about 2/3 of the star formation in close pairs takes place at separations above 30 kpc .",
    "this leads to a gradual suppression of star formation as gas is exhausted or driven out , while dynamical relaxation leads to secular evolution of spheroids without mergers .",
    "@xcite also suggest that in their sample star formation is triggered at large radii and then suppressed to form red close pairs . @xcite point out the role of mergers and interactions in suppressing star formation in most galaxy pairs , while @xcite present an analysis of the properties of single and widely spaced paired galaxies in the sdss and find evidence of delayed quenching , over timescales of a few gyrs , consistent with a ` harassment ' scenario as proposed here . on the other hand , an integral field unit study of the mice pair ,",
    "shows that little star formation has been induced so far @xcite .",
    "the bpt classifications , from emission line diagnostics , support the observation that galaxies in pairs are less active than their counterparts in the same volume . as remarked above",
    ", there is a deficit of star - forming galaxies in pairs .",
    "surprisingly , there is also no evidence of excess agn activity in galaxies in pairs .",
    "this is surprising as one expects mergers to trigger nuclear activity @xcite . in these models",
    "agns occur at or shortly after final coalescence so we should expect double qsos in close pairs @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , find qsos at several stages of the merging process even before the final merger . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "show that agns do not lie in more disturbed hosts and conclude that mergers are not necessarily responsible for nuclear activity .",
    "@xcite search for double qsos in pairs of galaxies where one member is already known to host an agn and find only one such case out of twelve objects .",
    "this suggests that nuclear activity is not necessarily related to the on - going mergers or interactions in these objects .",
    "@xcite also reports on a relative lack of agn activity in close pairs from the sdss although @xcite claims to find some enhancement from the same sample .",
    "@xcite also argue that there is less than 1@xmath99 significance for agn triggering in mergers from a volume - limited sample of sdss galaxies .",
    "we find no evidence of agn activity in strongly interacting mergers and merger remnant post - starburst galaxies in @xcite , although there are indications of centrally concentrated star formation and inside - out quenching in these objects .",
    "other studies find a stronger correlation between presence in a close pair and agn activity @xcite . in some cases",
    ", these discrepancies may be due to issues of selection , including the use of emission - line diagnostics rather than x - ray or mid - ir fluxes .    at face value",
    "our findings minimise the importance of major mergers and interactions for galaxy evolution and argue that most galaxy evolution takes place via internal and secular processes , as well as minor mergers , at least at low redshift .",
    "this is also the conclusion of several studies in this field ( e.g. , @xcite ) and is broadly in agreement with more recentmodels where minor mergers and secular evolution may play more important roles in galaxy evolution in the past 1/2 of the hubble time ( e.g. , @xcite ) ."
