    "the present paper first uses tutte s 1-factor theorem to give a positive answer to this question .    a set @xmath4 of disjoint hexagons of a fullerene graph @xmath0 is a _ resonant pattern _ ( or sextet pattern ) , in other words , such hexagons are _ mutually resonant _ , if @xmath0 has a perfect matching @xmath1 such that every hexagon in @xmath4 is @xmath1-alternating ; equivalently , if @xmath11 has a perfect matching , where @xmath11 denotes the subgraph obtained from @xmath0 by deleting all vertices of @xmath4 together with their incident edges .",
