    "torsion oscillators have been used successfully to measure an anomalous change in resonant period and accompanying dissipation in solid @xmath0he.@xcite it has been speculated that the observed signature is due to bose - einstein condensation of vacancies or interstitials forming a novel supersolid state in otherwise crystalline @xmath0he.@xcite early on , the change in resonant period has been attributed to a ( nonclassical ) decoupling of a supersolid component from the ( classical ) normal moment of inertia .",
    "this is not surprising , since the observed change in period is in agreement with similar observations of onset of superfluidity in liquid @xmath0he , measured a long time ago by torsion oscillators.@xcite however , it is important to remember that for liquid @xmath0he  it was already well established , long before the torsion oscillator ( to ) experiments were performed , that it undergoes a transition from liquid to superfluid with no viscosity .",
    "it was natural to use the connection between superflow and period drop .",
    "status of a search of supersolidity in solid @xmath0he  is different : a change in period has been reported , but no evidence of mass superflow@xcite or condensation @xcite has been seen below the expected transition temperature .",
    "it is therefore necessary to ask the question what is the relationship between the change in period and superflow , and what alternate physical mechanisms can explain the change in period and concomitant peak in dissipation .        a potential contender for an alternate explanation is the glass scenario , which automatically accounts for hysteresis effects , annealing dependence , linear term in specific heat , and long relaxation times in many observables .",
    "for example , the strong hysteresis effect reported by aoki et al.@xcite for the rim velocity dependence of the torsion oscillator , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , is consistent with a glassy response .",
    "however , it is difficult to explain within a supersolid scenario how increasing the rim velocity of the cell does not change the reported nonclassical rotational inertia : between slow and fast rim velocity one increases kinetic energy of solid , @xmath1 , and the ratio of kinetic energies is on the order of @xmath2 .",
    "fast rim velocity exceeds the supposed critical velocity of the condensate , @xmath3 , by several orders of magnitude .    in this article",
    ", we explore if a phenomenological glass model can account for the change in period without postulating a nonclassical moment of inertia .",
    "similar to the supersolid picture , we assume that only a small subsystem of solid @xmath0he  exhibits glassy properties that dominate the response at low temperatures . this is an important point ,",
    "since it has been argued before that the observed large change in dissipation can not be described by uniform bose - einstein condensation.@xcite it remains to be seen if nonuniform bose - einstein condensation alone either along grain boundaries @xcite or along the axis of screw dislocations @xcite can explain the dynamic response of tos .",
    "a discussion on the role of a glassy component does not rule in or out the presence of a supersolid component .",
    "we emphasize that our analysis addresses a glassy contribution regardless of the magnitude of a supersolid component .",
    "_ glass model : _ in previous work , we argued for the possibility of a glass phase at low temperatures , roughly below @xmath4 mk , to explain the observed anomalous linear temperature dependence in the specific heat of the otherwise perfect debye solid @xmath0he.@xcite below we will give an extended oscillator analysis for which the exact nature of the glass is not crucial .",
    "for example , it may be caused by two - level systems ( tls ) of pinned dislocation lines , vortex excitations , etc .",
    "however , it is important to point out that the amplitude of the period shift and dissipation peak can be changed dramatically by the growth history or annealing process of the crystal . in order to explain these puzzling features of solid @xmath0he",
    ", we conjectured earlier@xcite that structural defects , e.g. , localized dislocation segments , form a set of tls observable at low temperatures .",
    "these immobile crystal defects affect the _ thermodynamics_@xcite of bulk @xmath0heand the _ mechanics _ @xcite of the to loaded with @xmath0he . for the analysis of the specific heat",
    ", we used independent tls to obtain the universal glass signature of a linear - in - temperature specific heat term at low temperatures . in parallel , we used a phenomenological glass model , that may originate from an ensemble of tls , to describe the mechanical response of the to .    _",
    "torsion oscillator and rotational susceptibility : _ to set the discussion , we note that to experiments measure the period and dissipation .",
    "one applies a force and generates a displacement of the oscillator .",
    "the relationship between the force and displacement ( angle ) is controlled by the to susceptibility . in order to extract information from such an experiment",
    ", one needs a model to determine the relation between observable period and dissipation of the to and the corresponding moment of inertia , damping and effective stiffness of the media .",
    "we start with the general equation of motion for a harmonic to defined by an angular coordinate @xmath5 in the presence of an external and internal torque,@xcite @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the moment of inertia of the ( empty ) to chassis , @xmath8 is the restoring ( stiffness ) coefficient of the torsion rod , and @xmath9 is its dissipative coefficient .",
    "@xmath10 is the externally imposed torque by the drive .",
    "@xmath11 is the internal torque exerted by solid @xmath0he  on the oscillator for a system with time translation invariance . in general , the backaction @xmath12 is temperature , @xmath13 , dependent .",
    "the experimentally measured quantity is the angular motion of the to - _ not _ that of bulk helium , which is enclosed in it .",
    "ab initio , we can not assume that the medium moves as one rigid body .",
    "if the non - solid subsystem  freezes \" into a glass , the medium will move with greater uniformity and speed .",
    "this leads to an effect similar to that of the nonclassical rotational moment of inertia , although its physical origin is completely different .",
    "therefore , we argue for an alternate physical picture , namely that of softening of the oscillator s stiffness . the angular coordinate @xmath14 of the to is a convolution of the applied external torque @xmath15 with the to susceptibility @xmath16 . under fourier transformation the angular response of",
    "the to is @xmath17 defining the total angular susceptibility as @xmath18 , we write @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fourier transform of the backaction due to the added solid @xmath0he . in what follows",
    ", we will treat the backaction as a small perturbation to the to chassis .",
    "we now determine the experimental consequences of the phenomenological glass model , where a small glassy subsystem of solid @xmath0he  gives rise to the observed dynamic behavior .",
    "glass is generally defined as a supercooled liquid out of equilibrium on measurable time scales : its equilibration time becomes extremely large ( and unmeasurable ) at low temperatures .",
    "any glass former is a liquid at high temperature and becomes an amorphous solid ( the glass ) at sufficiently low temperatures . in this context bulk solid @xmath0he",
    "is not a glass former ; we are talking about glass forming within a small fraction of @xmath0he  sample .",
    "we note that our analysis will remain qualitatively unchanged for a general description of the system by a `` freezing '' at low temperature of the appropriate component ( defect or other ) that is dynamic at high temperatures ( see the appendix of nussinov et al.@xcite ) .",
    "we start by reviewing results for an underdamped harmonic torsion oscillator .",
    "the resonant period is obtained from the angular coordinate @xmath21 \\}$ ] , with a complex amplitude @xmath22 and complex frequency @xmath23 . in the case of an underdamped to with @xmath24 , the resonant period is @xmath25 , and the quality factor @xmath26 or dissipation is @xmath27 , with resonant frequency @xmath28 .    in the remainder , we use effective oscillator parameters , which are defined as the sum of parameters describing the chassis , @xmath29 , and the added solid @xmath0he  given by @xmath30 thus , we write the net moment of inertia @xmath31 and dissipation @xmath32 .",
    "the total response function of the to is given by eqns .",
    "( [ central ] ) and ( [ geq ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath33 captures the dynamics of a glass component and is a function of temperature and frequency . in the limit @xmath34 the term @xmath35 as the mechanical motion of any glass component will be the same as that of the surrounding solid .",
    "hence there will be no relative motion and no transient overdamped modes for @xmath36 .",
    "however , at any finite frequency @xmath37 , we can approximate the glass response by @xmath38 , where the coefficient @xmath39 measures the glassy contribution of the solid and is evaluated at the resonant frequency @xmath40 of the to . the dynamic response function @xmath41 of a glass",
    "can be approximated by a distribution of overdamped oscillators with different relaxation times @xmath42 .",
    "two popular relaxation time distributions used in the literature are the cole - cole ( cc ) and davidson - cole ( dc ) functions .",
    "both describe a superposition of overdamped oscillators.@xcite the cc distribution gives @xmath43 $ ] , while the dc distribution results in @xmath44^{\\beta}$ ] .    by comparison to eq .",
    "( [ central ] ) for the to chassis system with no helium , the glassy part of the backaction of @xmath0he , @xmath33 , renormalizes the effective spring stiffness @xcite @xmath45 these expressions flesh out the dependence of the medium response on the applied driving frequency .",
    "when the driving frequency is far more rapid , @xmath46 , then the transient response of the medium is that of a liquid . in that limit",
    ", the transient modes within the medium can not `` keep up '' with the driving torque and only the bare stiffness of the to remains augmented by the solid helium contribution .",
    "the effective spring stiffness is that of the driving oscillator , @xmath47 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq_shift2 ] ) .",
    "the limit @xmath48 corresponds to that of an ideal rigid low - temperature glass in which no transient liquid - like response of the system is present .",
    "by contrast , for slow oscillations @xmath49 , the excited modes within @xmath0he  are of characteristic transient time @xmath42 that is long enough to respond to the driving torque and lead to an additional backaction and effective reduction of the spring stiffness , see eq .",
    "( [ eq_shift1 ] ) . from this discussion",
    "it is clear that the maximum relative shift in period or frequency will depend on the glassy fraction @xmath39 given by @xmath50 , which can vary widely between different torsion oscillators , growth and annealing procedures .",
    "the resonant frequency of the to with backaction is given by the root of @xmath51 we anticipate that when the relaxation time is similar to the period of the underdamped to , the dissipation will be maximal . here , the glassy component responds with the same frequency as the `` normal '' solid component .",
    "the glassy part merely renormalizes the effective spring constant @xmath52 , but does not lead to additional transient modes , which closely interfere with the oscillations of the `` normal '' part of the to .",
    "we look for the largest magnitude of the imaginary part of the root and see when it is maximal as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "a larger imaginary part implies a shorter decay time and a smaller value of @xmath53 . since the homogeneous eq .",
    "( [ central_glass ] ) is scale invariant , we normalize all oscillator quantities by the effective moment of inertia @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .    as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ central_glass ] ) , for an ideal dissipationless oscillator , @xmath58 , the resonant frequency @xmath59 is the pole of @xmath60 in the limit @xmath48 .",
    "if we expand @xmath61 about this root , @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , then we find to leading order in @xmath64 @xmath65 therefore , the root attains an imaginary component @xmath66 and the dissipation becomes @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 . as @xmath40 increases for fixed @xmath8 , @xmath70 increases . for @xmath71 , the dissipation peaks near @xmath72 .",
    "similarly the resonant frequency becomes @xmath73 which increases monotonically when @xmath13 is lowered .",
    "for the special case of debye relaxation processes ( @xmath74 ) , we find @xmath75^{-1}$ ] and @xmath76^{-1}$ ] and recover results reported earlier,@xcite except for the additional contribution proportional to @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ p-1p ] ) .",
    "it follows that the changes in dissipation , @xmath78 , and frequency , @xmath79 , determine the glass relaxation time @xmath42 . combining eqns .",
    "( [ q-1p ] ) and ( [ p-1p ] ) we arrive at a general relation between shift in dissipation and frequency for @xmath80 : @xmath81 for example , for a dc glass distribution this becomes @xmath82 in the past , there have been several reports of large experimental ratios @xmath83.@xcite because of @xmath84 and for @xmath85 the ratio is limited to @xmath86 , this requires diverging relaxation times close to the temperature where the dissipation peaks . for such cases , @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ q - p - ratio - dc ] ) and ratios of order 10 can be obtained for values of @xmath88 . on the other hand , for @xmath89 ,",
    "( [ q - p - ratio ] ) simplifies even further with @xmath90 .",
    "similar results for the ratio were obtained for other phenomenological models with dissipative channels.@xcite for example , huse and khandker @xcite assumed a simple phenomenological two - fluid model , where the supersolid is dissipatively coupled to a normal solid resulting in a ratio of @xmath91 .",
    "yoo and dorsey@xcite developed a viscoelastic model and korshunov@xcite derived a tls glass model for solid @xmath0he  that captures the results of the general phenomenological glass model originally proposed by nussinov et al.@xcite here , we like to emphasize that it is challenging to reconcile a large dissipative @xmath92 ratio with uniform bose - einstein condensation.@xcite    we now make further assumptions about the glassy relaxation time @xmath42 . in many glass formers @xmath42 follows the phenomenological vogel - fulcher - tamman ( vft ) expression @xmath93 $ ] for @xmath94 . here , @xmath95 is the temperature at which an ideal glass transition occurs , which is below the temperature where the peak in dissipation occurs .",
    "the parameter @xmath96 is a measure of the fragility of the glass ( @xmath97 for fragile glasses @xcite ) .",

    "all samples of solid @xmath0he  used in this study had in common that they were grown with the blocked capillary method using commercial grade helium ( @xmath140he  impurity level @xmath141 ppm ) . also , it is important to remember that both glass models ( cc and dc ) use only five fit parameters : @xmath39 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and either an exponent @xmath52 or @xmath145 .",
    "all other oscillator parameters are determined by normal state properties of the to loaded with solid @xmath0he .",
    "in addition , we noticed during our analysis of the to experiments that in order to fit the glass models to the experimental data , we had to correct the resonant frequency by a small amount , @xmath146 , because in many reports @xmath147 is not available to desired absolute accuracy or data are only reported relative to a high - temperature resonant frequency .",
    "furthermore , the fits were complicated by the experimental observation of a slight temperature dependence of the resonant frequency at higher temperatures . to account for this drift in frequency of yet unknown origin",

    "it is worth pointing out that unlike in the debye relaxation analysis by hunt and coworkers ( a single overdamped mode ) , we do not require a supersolid component to simultaneously account for frequency shift and concomitant dissipation peak .",
    "finally , in fig .  [ fig3 ] , we report a dc and cc analysis of the measured data by aoki et al.@xcite for the in - phase mode of their double resonance compound to .",
    "we obtain excellent agreement between experiment and glass model assuming a cc distribution , while a dc distribution for glassy relaxation times results only in fair agreement .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that a phenomenological glass model describing a small subsystem of solid @xmath0he  can _ simultaneously _ account for the experimentally observed change in resonant period ( frequency ) and the concomitant peak in dissipation .",
    "our analysis of to experiments reveals that most are better described by a cole - cole distribution for glassy relaxation times . unlike for conventional structural or dielectric glasses , where the cc exponent @xmath52 is usually less than unity , we find consistently @xmath149",
    ". this may reflect on the possible nature of a quantum or superglass in solid helium .",
    "further , we derived a simple relation for the ratio of change in dissipation and change in resonant frequency ( period ) that can explain the large ratios of order @xmath150 observed in experiments .",
    "the values for the glass exponents @xmath52 or @xmath145 required to fit the experiments by the rutgers and cornell groups point toward broad distributions of glassy relaxation times .",
    "this invalidates any attempt to describe these experiments by a single overdamped mode ( debye relaxation ) .",
    "these glassy relaxation processes should also have significant effects on thermodynamics and dynamics of solid @xmath0he .",
    "the key result of this work is that many to experiments can be described assuming that a small fraction of solid @xmath0he undergoes a glass transition at low temperatures . whether or not there is a supersolid fraction present in solid @xmath0he is beyond this analysis .",
    "a frequency - tunable to may differentiate between a glassy contribution leading to an increase in the maximum frequency shift , @xmath151 , and no change in the dissipation shift , @xmath152 , with increasing @xmath40 , while the frequency shift for a supersolid should decrease with increasing @xmath40 .",
    "our study shows that the unequivocal identification of supersolidity in solid@xmath0he is challenging and does require clear understanding of normal state dynamics",
    ". clearly , more dynamic studies probing the frequency or time response to a stimulus and detailed bulk characterization of samples are necessary to investigate the differences between small subsystems of glassy , supersolid or superglassy origin .",
