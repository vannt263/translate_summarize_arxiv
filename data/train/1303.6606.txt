    "we start with the following question : how can it be determined whether an epidemic outbreak has occurred .",
    "obviously , this is hard to answer , because an accurate model of epidemic spread in real societies , which include complicated and heterogeneous human - to - human contact , can not be constructed .",
    "then , is it possible to predict the outbreak for a simple mathematical model ? even in this case , the manner of the early spread of disease may significantly influence states that manifest after a sufficiently long time .",
    "for example , it seems reasonable to conjecture that whether a single infected individual with a very high infection rate causes an outbreak may depend on the number of people infected by the individual , which is essentially stochastic . in the present paper ,",
    "we attempt to formulate this conjecture .    specifically , we study the stochastic sir model as the simplest epidemic model , where an edge in the network represents a human - to - human contact and the infection rate @xmath0 ( the infection probability per unit time in each edge ) is a parameter of the sir model ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for an introduction to the stochastic sir model ; see also refs .",
    "@xcite for related social dynamics on complex networks ) . the sir model may be defined for well - mixed cases @xcite , homogeneous networks @xcite , and scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "a remarkable phenomenon is that when @xmath0 exceeds a critical value @xmath1 , a disease spreads to macroscopic scales from a single infected individual , which corresponds to an epidemic outbreak .",
    "this was found in well - mixed cases and random graphs , but @xmath2 for scale free networks .",
    "that is , epidemic outbreaks are described as phase transition phenomena .",
    "in addition to the interest in theoretical problems , recently , the sir model on networks has been studied so as to identify influential spreaders @xcite and so as to determine a better immunization strategy @xcite .",
    "although the phase transition in the sir model may be a sort of percolation transition , its property is different from that of standard percolation models . in the sir model exhibiting the phase transition , the order parameter characterizing it may be the fraction of the infected population , which is denoted by @xmath3 . indeed , @xmath4 in the non - outbreak phase ( @xmath5 ) , whereas the expectation of @xmath3 becomes continuously non - zero from @xmath6 when @xmath7 .",
    "this phenomenon is in accordance with the standard percolation transition .",
    "however , on one hand , the order parameter in the percolated phase , e.g. the fraction of the largest cluster , takes a definite value with probability one in the thermodynamic limit ; on the other hand , the fraction of the infected population in the sir model is not uniquely determined even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in fact , it has been reported that the distribution function of the order parameter in sir models with finite sizes shows two peaks at @xmath4 and @xmath8 for well - mixed cases @xcite , homogeneous networks @xcite , and scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the probability density of @xmath3 in the thermodynamic limit may be expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath7 .",
    "this means that the value of the fraction of the infected population in the outbreak phase , which is either @xmath6 or @xmath13 , can not be predicted with certainty .",
    "we call this phenomenon the _ intrinsic unpredictability of epidemic outbreaks_.    in this paper , we clearify the meaning of .",
    "we first observe the phenomenon in the sir model defined on a random regular graph . by employing a mean field approximation",
    ", we describe the epidemic spread dynamics in terms of a master equation for two variables .",
    "then , with a system size expansion , we approximate the solutions to the master equation by those to a langevin equation .",
    "now we can analyze this langevin equation and work out the mechanism of the appearance of the two peaks .",
    "we also calculate @xmath14 near the transition point .",
    "let @xmath15 be a random @xmath16-regular graph consisting of @xmath17 nodes . for each @xmath18 , the state @xmath19 is defined , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 represent susceptible , infective , and recovered , respectively .",
    "the state of the whole system is given by @xmath23 , which is denoted by @xmath24 collectively .",
    "the sir model on networks is described by a continuous time markov process with infection rate @xmath0 and recovery rate @xmath25 .",
    "concretely , the transition rate @xmath26 of the markov process is given as @xmath27 with @xmath28   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\mu \\delta(\\sigma_x , { { \\rm i}})\\delta(\\sigma_x ' , { { \\rm r } } ) ,   \\label{rate - netmodel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a set of @xmath16-adjacent nodes to @xmath18 .",
    "hereinafter , without loss of generality , we use dimensionless time by setting @xmath30 . for almost all time sequences ,",
    "infective nodes vanish after a sufficiently long time , and then the system reaches a stationary state , which is called the _ final state_. the ratio of the total number of recovered nodes to @xmath17 in the final state is equivalent to the fraction of the infected population @xmath3 .",
    "this quantity measures the extent of the epidemic spread . at @xmath31",
    ", we assume that @xmath32 for only one node selected randomly and that @xmath33 for the other nodes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - sir - pm3d ] , as an example , we show the result of numerical simulations for the model with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we measured the probability density @xmath36 of the fraction of the infected population @xmath3 for various values of @xmath0 .",
    "this figure suggests that the expectation of @xmath3 becomes non - zero when @xmath0 exceeds a critical value .",
    "the important observation here is that @xmath37 in the outbreak phase has a sharp peak near @xmath4 , too .",
    "indeed , the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig - sir - pm3d ] clearly shows the existence of the two peaks in @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "similar graphs were reported in refs .",
    "the existence of the two peaks is not due to a finite size effect , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sir - nxxx - p0-n16 ] , where the probability that @xmath40 , which is denoted by @xmath41 , is plotted as a function of @xmath0 for several values of @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath42 when @xmath43 .",
    "these results suggest the limiting density ( [ goal ] ) , where @xmath14 becomes continuously non - zero for @xmath7 whereas @xmath44 for @xmath11 .",
    "this is the phenomenon that we attempt to understand in this paper .",
    "defining two variables @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we consider a continuous - time markov process of the two variables as an approximation of the sir model on the network @xcite .",
    "we expect the phenomenon we are concerned with to be reproduced within this approximation ; we verify this at a later stage .",
    "the transition rate of @xmath47 is exactly given as @xmath48 , and we approximate the rate @xmath49 as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the probability of finding @xmath52 such that @xmath53 for any @xmath54 . here , the infective nodes form a connected cluster , and this cluster is tree - like because the typical size of the loops is @xmath55 . now , as an approximation , we assume that there are @xmath56 edges connecting the tree - like cluster with susceptible nodes @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath51 is estimated as the rate of @xmath56 to the number of all edges @xmath57 in the thermodynamic limit",
    ". that is , @xmath58 .",
    "below , we focus on the case @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath59 be the probability density of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "then , @xmath59 obeys the master equation @xmath62 when @xmath17 is sufficiently large , the master equation for @xmath59 can be expanded as @xmath63 with @xmath64   + \\partial_s \\left(\\frac{\\lambda s i } { 2n}p \\right ) , \\nonumber \\\\ j_s&= &   -\\lambda s i p   - \\partial_s \\left ( \\frac{\\lambda s i } { 2n}p\\right ) + \\partial_i \\left(\\frac{\\lambda s i}{2n } p \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by assuming that @xmath65 terms can be ignored , we obtain the fokker - planck equation @xcite .    it can be confirmed by direct calculation that this fokker - planck equation ( [ snmst ] ) describes the time evolution of the probability density for the following set of langevin equations : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is gaussian white noise that satisfies @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the symbol `` @xmath70 '' in front of @xmath71 and @xmath72 in and represents the ito product rule .",
    "the same equations as and were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this description ,",
    "the fraction of the infected population is given by @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig - sy_lgv - pm3d ] , we show the result of numerical simulations of the langevin equations and . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig - sy_lgv - pm3d ] with fig .",
    "[ fig - sir - pm3d ] , we find that the phenomenon under study is described by the langevin equations and .",
    "thus , our problem may be solved by analyzing them .",
    "now , the key idea of our analysis is the introduction of a new variable @xmath74 .",
    "then , and are re - written as @xmath75 , \\label{s2_lgv } \\\\",
    "{ \\frac{d y}{d   t } } & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\{\\left(\\lambda s - 1\\right)y       -\\frac{1}{4}\\left({\\lambda s + 1 } \\right)\\frac{1}{y}\\right\\ }   \\nonumber   \\\\    & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{{\\lambda s } } \\cdot \\xi_1         + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{1}\\cdot \\xi_2 ,   \\label{y_lgv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where it should be noted that the multiplication of the variable @xmath76 and the noise does not appear in .",
    "we then consider the probability @xmath14 in the thermodynamic limit as the probability of observing @xmath77 , because it is equivalent to @xmath78 . here , from and",
    ", we find that the characteristic time scale of @xmath79 is @xmath17 times that of @xmath76 .",
    "thus , when @xmath17 is sufficiently large , @xmath79 almost retains its value when @xmath76 changes over time .",
    "in particular , it is reasonable to set @xmath80 when @xmath81 is shorter than @xmath17 . in this time interval , is expressed as @xmath82 where @xmath83 and the potential @xmath84 is calculated as @xmath85 @xmath86 is gaussian white noise with unit variance , where we have used the relation @xmath87 .",
    "the initial condition is given as @xmath88 .",
    "it should be noted that is independent of @xmath17 .",
    "thus , solutions satisfying @xmath89 in and correspond to solutions satisfying @xmath90 in .",
    "we identify @xmath14 with the probability of finding these solutions .",
    "we now derive this probability .",
    "first , we investigate the shapes of the graph @xmath91 .",
    "we find that @xmath92 for any @xmath0 and that @xmath91 monotonically increases in @xmath76 for @xmath93 , while @xmath84 has a single maximum peak at @xmath94 for @xmath95 , where @xmath96 as a reference , in fig .",
    "[ fig - u_y ] , we show the shapes of @xmath91 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 .    next , based on the shapes of the potential function , we discuss the expected behavior of solutions to .",
    "when @xmath99 , the probability of @xmath90 is obviously zero because @xmath84 is a monotonically increasing function in @xmath76 .",
    "that is , @xmath44 in this case .",
    "the behavior for @xmath100 is complicated .",
    "we thus focus on the case that @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is a small positive number . in this case , @xmath103 .",
    "we then note that if a solution @xmath76 to happens to exceed @xmath104 , it is comparatively likely that @xmath105 . assuming that the probability of @xmath105 under the condition @xmath106 at some time is unity",
    ", we estimate @xmath14 as the probability that @xmath76 exceeds @xmath104 .",
    "furthermore , we express @xmath14 in terms of the transition rate @xmath107 from @xmath108 to @xmath94 . noting that the transition rate from @xmath108 to @xmath109 is equal to the recovery rate in the original sir model , we can write @xmath110 since @xmath107 is positive and finite , we obtain @xmath111 . in this manner , we have clearly explained the probabilistic nature in the outbreak phase , and we have obtained @xmath112 .    finally , we calculate @xmath14 quantitatively near the transition point . from @xmath113 and @xmath114",
    ", we estimate the slope of the straight line connecting two points @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the @xmath117 plane as @xmath118 , which approaches zero in the limit @xmath119 .",
    "thus , the transition from @xmath108 to @xmath94 may be assumed to be free brownian motion with the diffusion constant @xmath83 .",
    "the transition rate from @xmath108 to @xmath104 is then estimated as @xmath120 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath121 in fig .",
    "[ fig - sy_lgv - sp - nxxx - fit ] , we compare the theoretical result with those obtained in numerical simulations of and .",
    "we measured the probability that @xmath122 , which is denoted as @xmath123 .",
    "recall that @xmath124 when @xmath125 .",
    "since the experimental result suggests @xmath126 in the limit @xmath127 , we claim that the theoretical result ( [ qep ] ) is in good agreement with the experimental result .",
    "in this paper , we have achieved a novel understanding of the intrinsic unpredictability of epidemic outbreaks by analyzing the langevin equation , which effectively describes this singular phenomenon .",
    "further , trajectories in the outbreak phase are divided into two groups : trajectories in one group are absorbed into zero , and the others diverge in .",
    "the division corresponds to the non - trivial limiting density given in . on the basis of this description , we calculated the probability of an epidemic outbreak near the transition point . before ending the paper , we make a few remarks .",
    "first , the probability @xmath14 was studied in the mathematical literature ( see @xcite and @xcite as reviews . ) to the best of our knowledge , the method proposed in this paper has never been used in previous studies .",
    "it might be interesting to connect our analysis with mathematical studies .",
    "second , although we have investigated the simplest model in this paper , similar analysis might be applied to various models . for example",
    ", we can consider the case that there are @xmath128 infected nodes at time @xmath31 .",
    "since the essence of the phenomenon is the existence of @xmath104 , the same result is obtained when @xmath128 is independent of @xmath17 . however , for the case @xmath129 with a small positive number @xmath130 , @xmath131 is never adsorbed to zero in the outbreak phase , because @xmath132 is infinitely far away from @xmath94 .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the case @xmath133 , which was reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fact , as suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig - sir - nxxx - p0-mn128-n16 ] , @xmath14 jumps discontinuously to @xmath134 which is similar to the behavior observed in standard percolation transitions .",
    "finally , as another generalization , one may study the behavior of the sir on more complex networks . in these cases , since the mean field approximation might not be effective , one needs to devise a new technique to describe the unpredictability of outbreaks .",
    "moreover , one of the most interesting is to predict probabilistic epidemic outbreaks from limited data on realistic networks .",
    "we hope that future studies will address these problems ."
