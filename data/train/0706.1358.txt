    "the standard model(@xmath7)@xcite@xcite of elementary particle physics provides a remarkably successful description of high energy physics phenomena at the energy scale up to @xmath8 . despite its tremendous success ,",
    "the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( @xmath9 ) remains the most prominent mystery in current particle physics , and the higgs boson mass suffers from an instability under radiative corrections leading to the `` hierarchy problem '' between the electroweak scale and the @xmath10 cut - off scale @xmath11 .",
    "the study of the @xmath9 and the `` hierarchy problem '' motivate many research works on the extensions of the @xmath7 .",
    "recently , the little higgs models have drawn a lot of interests as they offer an alternative approach to solve the `` hierarchy problem''@xcite , and were proposed as one kind of models of @xmath9 without fine - tuning in which the higgs boson is naturally light as a result of non - linearly realized symmetry@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most economical model of them is the littlest higgs(@xmath0 ) model , which is based on an @xmath12 nonlinear sigma model@xcite .",
    "the key feature of this kind of models is that the higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson of a global symmetry , which is spontaneously broken at some higher scale @xmath13 , and thus is naturally light .",
    "the @xmath9 is induced by a coleman - weinberg potential , which is generated by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom .    in the @xmath0 model without t - parity , a set of new heavy gauge bosons ( @xmath14 ) and a new heavy vector - like quark ( @xmath15 ) are introduced which just cancel the quadratic divergences of higgs self - energy induced by @xmath7 gauge boson loops and the top quark loop , respectively .",
    "however , it has been shown that the @xmath0 model without t - parity suffers from severe constraints from the precision electroweak data , which would require raising the masses of new particles to be much higher than @xmath16@xcite . to avoid this problem , t - parity",
    "is introduced into the @xmath0 model , which is called the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( @xmath1)@xcite . in the @xmath1 model , the @xmath7 particles are t - even and the most of the new heavy particles are t - odd .",
    "thus , the @xmath7 gauge bosons can not mix with the new gauge bosons , and the electroweak precision observables are not modified at tree level . beyond the tree level , small radiative corrections induced by the model to precision data still allow the symmetry breaking scale @xmath13 to be significantly lower than @xmath16@xcite . in the top - quark sector , the @xmath1 model contains a t - odd and a t - even partner of the top quark .",
    "the t - even partner of the top quark mixes with top quark and cancels the quadratic divergence from top quark loop in the contributions to higgs boson mass .",
    "consequently , the @xmath1 model could induce abundant new phenomenology in present and future experiments .    in previous works",
    ", it is concluded that the lhc has great potential to discover directly the new particles predicted by the little higgs models up to multi - tev mass scale , such as the colored vector - like quark @xmath15 , heavy gauge bosons and so on , in refs.@xcite@xcite and the references therein .",
    "after the new particles or interactions in the little higgs models had been directly discovered at the lhc experiment , the international linear collider(ilc ) would then play an important role in the detailed study of these new phenomena and accurate measurement of the interactions in the little higgs models .",
    "the precise measurement of the process of @xmath17 production at the ilc is particularly important for probing the yukawa coupling between top - quarks and the higgs boson with intermediate mass .",
    "actually , the @xmath18 production can be first detected at the cern lhc and further precisely measured at the ilc .",
    "it was pointed out that the @xmath19 yukawa coupling in @xmath20 process can be measured to @xmath21 accuracy with integral luminosity @xmath22 at an @xmath23 linear collider ( lc ) with @xmath24@xcite .",
    "the accurate predictions for the process @xmath20 at linear colliders in @xmath4 collision mode have been intensively discussed in many literatures@xcite-@xcite .",
    "chong - xing yue , et al . , studied the @xmath20 process in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 model at @xmath25@xcite .",
    "they found that in the parameter space preferred by the electroweak precision data in the @xmath0 model(@xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28)@xcite , the absolute value of the relative correction @xmath29 can be larger than @xmath30 , while in the @xmath1 model as long as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the value of @xmath33 can be larger than @xmath34 .",
    "that means in these parameter space the @xmath35 model effects might be observed in the future @xmath25 experiment . except the @xmath4 collision mode , an @xmath4 lc",
    "can also be operated as a @xmath36 collider .",
    "this is achieved by using compton backscattered photons in the scattering of intense laser photons on the initial @xmath4 beams .",
    "generally @xmath4 collider has the advantage that the luminosity is higher than @xmath36 collider , for example , @xmath37 or even @xmath38(through reducing emittance in the damping rings)@xcite , but the polarization technique for photon is much simpler than electron and the lc with continuous colliding energy spectrum of @xmath36 will be helpful to pursue new particles .",
    "therefore , lc can provide anther possibility to measure precisely the @xmath39 coupling in @xmath36 collision mode .",
    "similar with the study on the process @xmath20 at lc , the evaluation of radiative corrections to the process @xmath6 is also significant for the accurate experimental measurements of @xmath19 yukawa coupling at lc . in the ref.@xcite ,",
    "the calculations of the cross sections for @xmath6 and @xmath3 process including nlo qcd and one - loop electroweak corrections in the @xmath7 were presented .    due to the fact that it is speculated that the yukawa coupling between top - quarks and higgs boson is theoretically sensitive to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 contributions , and the @xmath18 associated productions may be favorable for probing these little higgs models . in this paper",
    "we study the reach of the ilc operating in @xmath36 collision mode to probe the @xmath0 and @xmath1 model in the process @xmath3 at the qcd next - to - leading order .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we give a brief review of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 model . in section 3",
    ", we present the notations and analytical calculation of the process @xmath3 including the qcd nlo radiative corrections . the numerical result and discussions",
    "are presented in section 4 . finally the conclusions are given .",

    "the sm fermions acquire their masses via the usual yukawa interactions .",
    "however , to cancel the large quadratic divergence in the higgs boson mass due to the heavy top quark yukawa interaction in the @xmath7 , a pair of new colored weak singlet weyl fermions @xmath40 and @xmath41 is required in addition to the usual third family weak doublet @xmath42 and weak singlet @xmath43 , where @xmath43 and @xmath41 are the corresponding right - handed singlets . and",

    ", we get the physical states of the top quark @xmath55 and a new heavy - vector - like quark @xmath15 , and obtain the usual mass result for the eigenvalues corresponding to the top quark @xmath55 and the heavy top @xmath15 which are up to order @xmath56 : @xmath57    from the lagrangian shown in eq.([lag ] ) , the couplings in the @xmath0 model concerned in the calculation of @xmath6 process can be expressed as : @xmath58\\\\ g_{t\\bar{t}h}^{lh } & = & - i \\frac{\\lambda_1 ^ 2}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_1 ^ 2+\\lambda_2 ^ 2 } } \\left ( 1 + c_{\\lambda}^{2 } \\right ) \\frac{v}{f},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is one of the vacuum expectation values(@xmath60 ) , @xmath61 is define as @xmath62@xcite(@xmath53 and @xmath54 are the yukawa coupling parameters ) , @xmath63 is the scalar mixing angle of higgs fields , @xmath64 , where we define @xmath65@xcite .",
    "recently , the symmetry structure of the the @xmath0 model was enlarged by introducing an additional discrete symmetry , t - parity , in analogy to the r - parity in the minimal supersymmetric standard model(@xmath66)@xcite .",
    "the t - parity interchanges the two subgroups @xmath67_1 $ ] and @xmath67_2 $ ] of @xmath68 . due to t - parity , the new gauge bosons do not mix with the @xmath7 gauge bosons and thus the new particles do nt generate corrections to precision electroweak observables at tree level .",
