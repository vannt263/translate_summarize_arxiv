    "viscous discs can acquire large dimensions under the effect of angular momentum redistribution .",
    "this is corroborated by the observation of young stellar objects ( yso ) which reveals the emission of wide gaseous discs with an outer radius reaching @xmath6 au ( beckwith et al .",
    ", 1990 ; pudritz et al . ,",
    "1996 ; duvert et al . , 1998 ; guilloteau & dutrey , 1998 ; shepherd & kurtz , 1999 ) . also ,",
    "discs hosted by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , although yet unresolved |except in the active galaxy ngc4258 ( herrnstein et al . , 1999)| could probably be of much larger size .",
    "the existence of strong similarities between ysos and agns , like jets and outflows ( falcke , 1998 ; frank , 1998 ) , some excesses in the spectral energy distribution at infrared wavelengths ( adams & shu , 1986 ; zdziarski , 1986 ; bertout , 1989 ; sanders et al . , 1989 ; voit 1991 ; kenyon , yi & hartmann , 1996 ) , a surrounding ( dusty ) torus ( gsten , chini & neckel , 1984 ; th & molster , 1994 ; drinkwater , combes & wiklind , 1996 ; sandqvist , 1999 ) indicates that the same physical mechanisms should take place in discs , despite the difference in the central mass scale .",
    "this constitutes an interesting challenge for the disc theory , especially to understand the transport of angular momentum .",
    "many models are based on the @xmath0-theory of thin discs ( shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ; pringle , 1981 ) and assume a vertically averaged structure ( e.g. , collin & dumont 1990 ; ruden & pollack , 1991 ; cannizzo & reiff , 1992 ; hur et al .",

    "a physically more satisfactory approach is the investigation of the vertical structure in detail , as done for stars .",
    "such a problem has been discussed by several groups already , in different contexts , with various goals and degrees of sophistication : at the scale of agns ( cannizzo , 1992 ; wehrse , strzer & shaviv , 1993 ; drrer et al . , 1996 ; siemiginowska , czerny & kostyunin , 1996 ; hubeny & hubeny , 1998 and references therein ; sincell & krolik , 1997 ; raska et al . , 1999 ) , in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) ( smak , 1984 ; mineshige & osaki , 1983 ; meyer & meyer - hofmeister , 1982 ; pojmaski , 1986 ; see cannizzo , 1993 for a review ; milsom , chen & taam ; 1994 ; dubus et al . , 1999 ) and in ysos ( malbet & bertout , 1991 ; bell et al . , 1997 ; dalessio et al .",
    ", 1998 ) including the primitive solar nebula ( psn ) ( lin & papaloizou , 1980 ; papaloizou & terquem , 1999 ) .",
    "basic considerations show that the outermost regions of ( low mass ) discs are expected to be regulated by self - gravity ( goldreich & lynden - bell , 1965 ; shlosman & begelman , 1987 )",
    ". this may be the case of agn and yso discs .",
    "a few constraints on the disc thickness , mass and rotation motion at large radii are set by observations ( guilloteau & dutrey , 1998 ; mundy , looney & welch , 2000 ; herrnstein et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "so , it appears essential to construct models for as accurate and realistic as possible , despite the lack of knowledge regarding turbulent viscosity which causes accretion . to our knowledge ,",
    "no self - consistent 2d - model accounting for vertical self - gravity in the outermost parts of discs has been published yet .",
    "this is the aim of this paper .",
    "the present model includes simultaneously vertical convection , self - gravitation , turbulent pressure , and realistic equation of state ( eos ) and opacities . of particular interest here",
    "is the transition from the `` classical '' disc to the self - gravitating disc which is predicted to be as close as a few @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the radius of the central object ) by vertically averaged models ( ruden & pollack , 1991 ; dalessio , calvet & hartmann , 1997 ; hur , 1998 ) .",
    "the hypothesis of the model and relevant equations are developed in sect .",
    "two versions of the @xmath0-prescription are tested .",
    "the ingredients ( eos and opacities ) as well as the numerical method are presented in sect .",
    "3 . we discuss in sect .",
    "4 a few properties of the model , namely the effect of turbulent pressure and depth dependent viscosity , and the position of the inner edge of the self - gravitating disc , for prototypal circumstellar and agn discs , for various accretion rates . an appendix contains a note concerning the treatment of convection and a high precision formula fitting the eos .",
    "a distinctive feature of steady state keplerian accretion discs is the absence of coupling between the vertical structure and the radial structure ( e.g. frank , king & raine , 1992 ) .",
    "this attractive property is undoubtedly an oversimplification and probably does not match reality .",
    "however , it is particularly advantageous from a modeling point of view because any annulus can be treated individually , whatever the state of neighbors , unlike in thick discs where pressure gradients and energy transport in the radial direction gain in importance with respect to their vertical counterparts ( maraschi , reina & treves , 1976 ; abramowicz , calvani & nobili , 1980 ; abramowicz et al . , 1988 ;",
    "narayan , madevan & quataert , 1998 ) .",
    "note that the keplerian assumption which fixes the rotation law to the value @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the central mass and @xmath11 the polar radius , requires that the gas remains confined at altitudes @xmath12 such as @xmath13 , and small radial pressure gradients too .    self - gravity may influence and even dominate the equilibrium structure and dynamical evolution of almost any kind of disc , not only in massive or thick discs or tori where effects are global ( bodo & curir , 1992 ; hashimoto , eriguchi , mller , 1995 ; boss , 1996 ; laughlin & ryczka , 1996 , masuda , nishida & eriguchi , 1998 ) , but also in low mass keplerian discs ( paczyski , 1978 ; shlosman & begelman , 1987 ) as soon as the mass density of the accreted gas exceeds @xmath14 locally , @xmath15 being the rotation frequency . in that latter case which is of interest here ,",
    "self - gravity increases vertical pressure gradients and gathers matter closer to the midplane ( sakimoto & coroniti , 1981 ; shore & white , 1982 ; cannizzo & reiff , 1992 ; hur et al . , 1994 ; hur , 1998 ) .",
    "so , only the outermost regions of keplerian discs where @xmath15 reaches low values can be affected by vertical self - gravity , except in very special situations ( e.g. sincell & krolik , 1997 ) .",
    "accounting correctly for the disc gravity requires the resolution of the poisson equation ( hunter , 1963 ; strzer , 1993 ; bertin & lodato , 1999 ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gas mass density and @xmath18 is the gravitational potential due to the bare disc ( the @xmath19-invariance is assumed ) .",
    "this is a very difficult task , in particular because the disc surface has a non trivial form which is not known a priori and the deviation from sphericity is extreme . as eq.([eq : fish ] ) connects all annuli together , the method of `` independent rings '' no longer applies , unless an iterative scheme in which the potential would be step by step improved from the actual density field until convergence ( stahler , 1983 ) .",
    "there is however no guarantee that such a scheme effectively converge and the computational time might be prohibitive ( eriguchi & mller , 1991 ) . here , we follow another , more simple approach : we adopt the infinite and @xmath11-homogeneous slab approximation ( paczynski , 1978 ; sakimoto & coroniti , 1981 ; shore & white , 1982 ; cannizzo & reiff , 1992 ; liu , xie & ji , 1994 ; hur , 1998 ) which yields the gravity due to the disc @xmath20 where the surface density @xmath21 is defined by @xmath22 but other assumptions are possible ( mineshige & umemura , 1997 ) .",
    "this enables again to investigate the disc structure annulus by annulus , but introduces a bias : it tends to overestimate ( underestimate ) self - gravity in regions of high ( respectively low ) densities .",
    "we expect that the present approximation gives acceptable results , at least in regions where the surface density radial gradients remain low with respect to density .",
    "anyway , the error made with respect to a self - consistent model is not known and would be interesting to estimate .",
    "when the upward transport of heat is treated in the diffusion approximation , the vertical structure of a keplerian disc , possibly irradiated , can be determined from the resolution of a system of four first order coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) in between the midplane and the top of the disc ( pojmaski , 1986 ; tuchman , mineshige & wheeler , 1990 ; cannizzo , 1992 ; meyer & meyer - hofmeister , 1982 ; milsom , chen & taam , 1994 ; dubus et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "the complexity of the problem rises when a multi - frequency radiative transfer is performed , as required to compare theoretical spectra with observations and make key predictions ( ross , fabian & mineshige , 1992 ; wehrse , strzer & shaviv , 1993 ; drrer et al . , 1996 ; sincell & krolik , 1997 ; dalessio et al .",
    "1998 ; el - khoury & wickramasinghe , 1998 ; hubeny & hubeny , 1998 ; de kool & wickramasinghe , 1999 ) .",
    "the four equations specify respectively ( frank , king & raine , 1992 ) :    * the pressure gradient @xmath23 which describes the hydrostatic equilibrium of each fictitious slab @xmath24 * the heat flux gradient @xmath25 due to viscous heating @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath12-dependent viscosity law ( see sect .",
    "2.4 ) , * the temperature gradient @xmath28 which is determined by the heat net flux transported upwards through radiation and convection @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the pressure height scale and @xmath31 is the actual gradient ( see the appendix , sect .",
    "a ) , * the surface density gradient @xmath32 @xmath33    note that this last equation is not relevant when self - gravity is left apart ( the total surface density of the disc + atmospheres @xmath34 can be easily computed a posteriori from eq.([eq : sigma ] ) , once the mass density distribution is known ) .",
    "the above odes must be supplemented by a closure relation , an equation of state . for a mixture of radiation and perfect gas undergoing atomic ionization and molecular dissociation at lte",
    ", the total pressure is linked to the density and temperature of matter by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mean mass per particle which depends on the density and temperature ( see sect . 3.1 and the appendix , sect .",
    "the above expression for radiation pressure is compatible with an optically thick disc only .",
    "turbulence is the main mechanism driving accretion in discs .",
    "it is an extra source of pressure . according to the standard theory of @xmath0-discs ( shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ; pringle , 1981 ) , the typical velocity of turbulent eddies can be taken as @xmath37 if one assumes the equipartition between length and velocity turbulent scales ( @xmath38 is the adiabatic sound speed ) .",
    "so , the turbulent pressure is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the first adiabatic exponent in the total ( gas plus radiation ) pressure .",
    "the effect of turbulent pressure on the hydrostatic equilibrium is therefore expected if @xmath0 is not too small , as simulations shall confirm .",
    "if we include @xmath41 into eq.([eq : eh1 ] ) and rewrite it in terms of a density gradient equation , we find @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are respectively the temperature and density exponents of the total pressure , and we have assumed @xmath45 ( this is justified since @xmath46 , see for instance the appendix , fig.([fig_coefs ] ) ) .",
    "this expression clearly shows the existence of a density inversion ( that is , a zone where @xmath47 ) each time the actual gradient satisfies @xmath48 ( raska et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "such an inversion is likely to occur in radiative pressure dominated layers where @xmath43 is the largest or / and in convectively unstable zones where @xmath49 may be large .",
    "note that the inversion still remains if turbulent pressure plays a role , but with a weaker amplitude .",
    "it is likely that turbulent pressure plays a role , not only on the hydrostatic equilibrium as considered here , but also on advection of matter and energy both radially and vertically .",
    "we ignore these effects .",
    "in vertically averaged disc models , the anomalous viscosity takes locally a mean value defined from midplane quantities , namely @xmath50 ) . here , we need to specify how @xmath27 varies with the altitude .",
    "this point is critical since our knowledge of turbulent viscosity remains extremely limited , if not null .",
    "there are however two standard ways to do this within the framework of the @xmath0-prescription .",
    "the most common one is to assume that the shear stress is proportional to some pressure ( the so - called `` @xmath51-formalism '' ; e.g. cannizzo , 1992 ) .",
    "it leads to a viscosity law @xmath52 where @xmath53 can be either gas pressure , or total pressure or some combination of the two ( siemiginowska , czerny & kostyunin , 1996 ; artemova et al . , 1996 ;",
    "hameury et al .",
    ", 1998 ; papaloizou & terquem , 1999 ) , with different consequences on the disc stability ( camenzind , demole & straumann 1986 ; clarke , 1988 ) .",
    "the other way uses the local version of the @xmath0-prescription ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister , 1982 ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the reduced pressure height scale ( see the appendix , sect .",
    "whatever the expression the authors adopt , the @xmath0-parameter is most often assigned to a fixed value in a disc .",
    "however , theoretical arguments , numerical simulations as well as observational constraints indicate that @xmath0 should vary , not only with the radius ( shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ; cannizzo , 1993 ; lasota & hameury , 1998 ) , but also with the altitude via the temperature or density , or other quantities ( brandenburg , 1998 ) .",
    "strictly speaking , the need for strong variations of the @xmath0-parameter means the failure of the @xmath0-viscosity model .    since @xmath56 and @xmath57 are formally different , even with the same @xmath0-parameter , they lead to different vertical structures and consequently to different discs , as we shall see below . besides , the correspondence between the two laws ( a multiplying factor @xmath58 from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , if @xmath59 ) is much more subtile than shifting @xmath0 : in general , @xmath60 at any altitude ( this is specially true at the equatorial plane where @xmath61 ; see sect .",
    "the volumic energy production associated to @xmath57 is @xmath62 note that both eqs.([eq : nu1 ] ) and ( [ eq : nu2 ] ) satisfy @xmath63 above the equatorial plane , meaning that the gas is accreted much faster at the equatorial plane than at the top of the disc .",
    "so , these laws implicitly suggest the existence a plan parallel shear which might be able to trigger turbulence and to expand turbulent eddies in the radial direction .",
    "there are still no physical arguments to decide if @xmath57 is better than @xmath56 .",
    "that is why we use both expressions in the following ( in particular , for @xmath56 we take @xmath64 ) .",
    "in fact , a wide class of functions @xmath65 should be considered and their effects compared .",
    "it is possible that turbulent viscosity shows a weaker dependence with @xmath12 than considered so far and even does not depend on the altitude at all .",
    "this is precisely the case with the @xmath66-viscosity prescription which is suggested by laboratory experiments ( pringle & rees , 1972 ; lynden - bell & pringle , 1974 ; richard & zahn , 1999 ; duschl , biermann & strittmatter , 2000 ; hur , richard & zahn , 2000 ) .      in the eddington approximation , the structure of the atmosphere",
    "is governed by three ( only two in the absence of self - gravity ) first orders odes .",
    "two of these ( namely eqs.([eq : eh1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sd2 ] ) ) are basically the same as for the disc interior , and the third one controls the optical depth @xmath67 in the atmosphere @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a grey absorption coefficient . in order",
    "to prevents any temperature runaway which would lead to the formation of a hot corona ( shaviv & wehrse , 1991 ; raska et al . , 1999 )",
    ", we assume that there is no viscous energy generation in this layer and no active turbulence .",
    "it means that the atmosphere is not accreted .",
    "we are aware that the validity of all these approximations , including the eddington approximation , is easily open to criticism .",
    "the temperature within the atmosphere follows the law ( mihalas , 1978 ) @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the effective temperature which is fixed by the outgoing flux due to internal and external heating sources , at the photosphere s base .",
    "actually , the global effect of the disc irradiation can be taken into account at this level by a suitable definition of @xmath72 ( kenyon & hartmann , 1987 ; hubeny , 1990 ; robinson , marsh & smak , 1993 ; dubus et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "wee see from eqs.([eq : eh1 ] ) , ( [ eq : tau ] ) and ( [ eq : tdistrib ] ) that the density gradient is @xmath73 and may also become positive .",
    "as suggested above , we do not take into account turbulent pressure in this layer .",
    "this induces a discontinuity in the density ( or gas pressure ) gradient at the altitude where the disc and its atmosphere join together , but not in the density itself .",
    "there are two problems to solve simultaneously : the structure of the disc interior from eqs.([eq : dfoverdz])([eq : temp])([eq : sd2 ] ) and ( [ eq : eh2 ] ) and the structure of its atmosphere from eqs.([eq : sd2])([eq : tau ] ) and ( [ eq : eh3 ] ) .",
    "these differential equations are subject to dirichlet boundary conditions . at the midplane",
    ", the symmetry imposes @xmath74 and @xmath75 like for a star . at the top atmosphere located at @xmath76 ( to be determined )",
    ", conditions are @xmath77 the ambient pressure ( which may include the pressure due to external illumination ) , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , half the total surface density of the disc and atmosphere .",
    "some authors specify the density ( for instance @xmath80 ) instead of the pressure at the boundary ( e.g. pojmaski , 1986 ; drrer et al . 1993 ; el - khoury & wickramasinghe , 1999 ) .",
    "we choose a value typical of the interstellar medium , namely @xmath81 k.@xmath82 ( duley & williams , 1988 ) , significantly smaller than in dalessio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . at the base of the atmosphere located at @xmath83 ( to be determined too ) ,",
    "the matching conditions are @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( see sect .",
    "it is worthy of note that boundary conditions at the disc surface have a very weak effect on midplane quantities as long as the disc is optically thick and has a large surface density , locally .",
    "such an insensitivity is well known in stellar structure computations ( kippenhahn & weigert , 1990 ) .",
    "let us quote also that , contrary to a general belief , models that do not consider the atmosphere and use @xmath86 as a boundary condition at @xmath83 always violate the eddington approximation since this relation does not guarantee that the atmosphere has the right optical thickness ( i.e. @xmath87 ) .",
    "further , the approximation @xmath88 becomes bad in regions where the surface density of the atmosphere is comparable to that of the disc , when the mean absorption within the atmosphere is low , or when the disc is not optically very thick .",
    "for these reasons , we sustain the idea that the use of the eddington approximation has sense only if the structure of the atmosphere is computed together with that of the disc interior .",
    "the physical problem depends on a certain amount of thermodynamical and radiative data . for the present application ,",
    "the gas has cosmic abundances and is subject to atomic ionizations and molecular dissociations .",
    "local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) is assumed ( hur et al . , 1994b ) .",
    "the mean mass per particle @xmath89 , coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 , adiabatic gradient @xmath90 , heat capacity @xmath91 ( needed to treat convective transport ) and adiabatic exponent @xmath92 have been computed accurately from chemical abundances at thermal equilibrium ( hur , 1998 ) .",
    "grids of data with @xmath17 and @xmath93 as the inputs have been generated .",
    "interpolations between mesh points are performed with bicubic splines .",
    "we have computed a high precision analytical expression fitting @xmath94 ( and subsequently coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) as functions of the temperature and density with an accuracy less than 4@xmath95 relative to raw data in the case of a zero metallicity gas ( see the appendix , sect . b1 ) .",
    "this fit can be used for a cosmic gas as well without producing important errors ( since metals in a cosmic mix have very low abundances relative to hydrogen , with almost no influence on the eos and related quantities ) .",
    "opacity is probably the most important ingredient of the model and the choice for the grey absorption coefficient @xmath69 is critical , specially near the surface ( mihalas , 1978 ) . here , we take ( hameury et al .",
    ", 1998 ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the rosseland and planck means respectively , and @xmath99 is a function which varies continuously from 0 to 1 as the optical depth increases from 0 to infinity .",
    "a suitable choice is @xmath100 where the index @xmath101 sets the stiffness of the transition from @xmath98 to @xmath97 ( @xmath102 is taken in the following applications ) .",
    "the @xmath99-function is arbitrary and should strongly influence physical quantities at the disc surface . also , we are aware that the best grey coefficient is probably neither given by @xmath97 , nor by @xmath98 , nor by eq.([eq : kgrey ] ) .",
    "a flux weighted opacity mean could be better ( mihalas , 1978 ; hubeny , 1990 )",
    ".    tables of rosseland and planck means have been taken from various sources ( pollack et al . , 1994 ;",
    "hur et al .",
    ", 1994b ; alexander & fergusson , 1994 ; henning & stognienko , 1996 , seaton et al . , 1994 ) . but",
    "planck absorption means published by the opacity project ( op ) ( seaton et al . , 1996 )",
    "have not be selected due to apparently large errors of unknown origin ( alexander , 1998 ; zeippen , 1999 ) .",
    "two grids of data have been generated after passing through filters ( mainly running averages ) to smooth out discontinuities .",
    "finally , opacity grids cover the temperature range @xmath103 k and extend from extremely high to extremely low densities where the ideal gas and lte assumptions are expected to fail .",
    "an example of rosseland and planck means versus the temperature is displayed in fig.([fig_opac ] ) .",
    "as done for the equation of state and related quantities , opacity values between mesh points are interpolated using bicubic splines . working with analytical opacities",
    "may present some advantages ( burgers & lamers , 1989 ; collin & dumont , 1990 ; bell & lin , 1994 ) , but they can also produce numerical instabilities in the integration of the disc structure equations since they mostly consist in continuous but non derivable piecewise functions .      the altitude of the top atmosphere being not known a priori , many numerical methods for solving two boundary value problems ( tbvps ) are almost unusable in the actual situation .",
    "it is however possible to apply variable changes , namely @xmath104 in the atmosphere and @xmath105 in the disc interior ( cannizzo & cameron , 1988 ) in order to recover a common tbvp with fixed boundaries ( e.g. @xmath106 $ ] ) , but this drastically increases vertical gradients near the surface and make the problem more unstable from a numerical point of view .",
    "some groups work with relaxation algorithms ( cannizzo , 1992 ; milsom , chen & taam , 1994 ; dalessio et al . , 1998 ;",
    "hameury et al . ,",
    "1998 ) which require ( good ) vertical profiles as starting guesses and are known to be rapidly converging methods .",
    "however , zones with steep gradients generally need a local mesh refinement .",
    "other authors prefer straight integrators and algorithms based on shooting methods ( lin & papaloizou , 1980 ; meyer & meyer - hofmeister , 1982 ; mineshige & osaki , 1983 ; smak , 1984 ; mineshige , tuchman & wheeler , 1990 ; raska et al . , 1998 ; papaloizou & terquem , 1999 ) typical of initial values problems ( ivps ) , with only a few quantities to guess but with possible troubles regarding the precision .    in the present case",
    ", we have written a fortran code named vs@xmath107kad which performs the integration of the disc and atmosphere equations using single side shooting and numerical routines specially designed for stiff ivps .",
    "integration steps are variable , internally to the routines and the accuracy can be as small as the machine precision . in its present version ,",
    "the code works with the following variables : @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath67 , but more clever choices are possible , specially to reduce artificially the stiffness of the equations .",
    "we have noticed that the computational time is considerably smaller than with runge - kutta algorithms , even with a variable step . like in many stiff problems ,",
    "the numerical integration may turn out to be non conservative : integrating from the top atmosphere down to the midplane can give a solution which , in the surface neighborhood , can be very different than that obtained when integrating in the opposite direction ( mineshige , tuchman & wheeler , 1990 ; press et al . , 1992 ; de kool & wickramasinghe , 1999 ) .",
    "this has been observed in the present case .",
    "it reminds the influence of both boundary conditions and underlying methodology .",
    "the best stability and reliability of the results are obtained by starting from the boundary layer where almost all the stiffness of the problem is concentrated .    in practical ,",
    "given a central mass @xmath10 , accretion rate @xmath112 , @xmath0-parameter , radius @xmath11 and total energy deposition @xmath113 at the bottom atmosphere ( see sect . 4.1 ) , the computation starts at an arbitrary altitude @xmath114 ( the top atmosphere ) where the surface density @xmath115 is guessed .",
    "the integration then proceeds downwards .",
    "once the bottom atmosphere is reached , at an altitude @xmath116 , the equations for the disc interior are integrated down to the midplane where the net flux and surface density generally differ from zero . by successive iterations on @xmath117 and",
    "@xmath118 |performed with a newton - raphson method| , quantities @xmath119 and @xmath120 can be driven to very small values .",
    "the problem has converged after @xmath121 iterations , when simultaneously @xmath122 and @xmath123 with the requested precisions @xmath124 @xmath125 and @xmath126 where @xmath127 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are very small , positive values .",
    "since our treatment of self - gravity is very approximate , it is legitimate to allow a much lower ( but sufficient ) precision on the surface density ( this accelerates convergence and lowers the computational time ) . on average",
    ", it takes a few milliseconds cpu on a single user personal computer and @xmath132 with @xmath133 where @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "this precision is sufficient in most cases .",
    "when self - gravity is neglected , eq.([eq : sd2 ] ) becomes obsolete .",
    "the iteration is on the flux only and the code then runs much faster ( by a factor @xmath137 ) , with @xmath138 .    the code has been tested and compared in many situations ( e.g. without self - gravity , without turbulent pressure , with and without external irradiation ) with reference models ( raska , 1998 ; hameury et al . , 1998 ) and appears to behave very well .",
    "it automatically scales to the central mass , and is able to model any kind of disc : agn discs , cv discs , yso discs and sub - nebulae as well .",
    "a simulation of d / h enrichments in the psn with this code is currently under way ( hersant , gautier , hur , 2000 ) .",
    "vertically averaged disc models show that the non self - gravitating and gas pressure dominated parts of @xmath0-discs have an aspect ratio @xmath139 , depending on the central mass and accretion rate mainly .",
    "there is a slight flaring ( i.e. @xmath140 ) which eventually may vanish in the outermost regions ( e.g. ruden & pollack , 1991 ; bell et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "the existence of a flaring inner disc is supported by observations : the spectrum of t - tauri stars and agn contains a prominent infrared component which is currently interpreted as light re - processing in the superficial layers of the disc ( adams & shu , 1986 ; voit , 1991 ; chiang & goldreich , 1997 ) .",
    "it is possible that self - irradiation also plays a role ( fukue , 1992 ) .",
    "for circumstellar discs , the flaring angle of bare @xmath0-disc is too low to enhance the infrared spectral component to the observed level ( kenyon & hartmann , 1987 ) . and",
    "the heating by the central star should not produce a significant increase of the flaring ( e.g. dalessio et al .",
    "but the long wavelength emission can efficiently be boosted if the disc gets into a warped configuration ( terquem & bertout , 1993 ; miyoshi et al . , 1995 ; bachev , 1999 ) .    beyond a certain radius ,",
    "self - gravity becomes important and reduces the disc thickness such that @xmath141 ( sakimoto & coroniti , 1981 ; shore & white , 1982 ; cannizzo & reiff , 1992 ; liu , xie & ji , 1994 ; hur et al .",
    ", 1994a ; hur , 1998 ) .",
    "as we shall see below , the same effect is observed from vertical structure computations .",
    "it means that outer parts should not receive directly light emitted at the center , contrary to the inner parts .",
    "note that a disc is generally not isolated but embedded into a `` warm '' environment which may in turn heat it up .",
    "discs in yso are surrounded by an envelope of gas and dust resulting from the cloud core collapse ( mundy , looney & welch , 2000 ; chick & cassen , 1997 ; dalessio , calvet & hartmann , 1997 ) . in the case of agn ,",
    "clouds moving above the disc ( blr clouds ) can scatter light back onto it ( shields 1977 ; collin - souffrin , 1987 ; osterbrock , 1993 ) .",
    "it follows that , even outer regions which are not directly exposed to the luminous central source can be substantially irradiated .",
    "the disc response to irradiation is a complex problem to solve self - consistently since it depends on many parameters ( size and location of the ionizing source(s ) , shape of the ionizing spectrum , intensity of irradiation , disc flaring angle , surface albedo , disc optical thickness , gas metalicity , etc . ) which are neither well known , nor well constrained by current observations . for discs having a large total surface density , mostly the superficial layers are heated up and ionized , and the midplane is essentially not affected ( sincell & krolik , 1997 ; collin & hur , 1999 ; nayakshin , kazanas & kallman , 1999 ; igea & glassgold , 1999 ) . deep structural changes ( for instance , a temperature inversion or an iso - thermalization )",
    "may however occur in some cases ( dalessio et al .",
    "although discs should experience some external heating , even in their outermost ( self - gravitating ) parts , we do not consider irradiation in this paper , for simplicity .",
    "so , considering internal viscous heating only , the disc effective temperature , far from the central object , is given by @xmath142 where @xmath112 is the mass accretion rate .    in the following ,",
    "we apply the code to the computation of the vertical structure of two different systems subject to vertical self - gravity : circumstellar discs and agn discs .",
    "we restrict to central masses of @xmath143 m@xmath2 and @xmath1 m@xmath2 respectively , and we show on a few examples how self - gravity and turbulent pressure which are the main specificities of this model affect the disc structure .",
    "computations are performed discarding any kind of instabilities the disc could undergo .",
    "these are stopped when the temperature at the top atmosphere ( i.e. @xmath144 ) attains 10 k , for both physical and practical reasons .      to see clearly the influence of turbulent pressure ( see eq.([eq : pt ] ) ) , we have chosen a simulation with @xmath145 which corresponds to the very upper limit regarding supersonic turbulence .",
    "in addition , convection and self - gravitation are turned off . under these circumstances ,",
    "we have computed the vertical structure with viscosity law @xmath56 for an disc around a massive black hole with @xmath146 m@xmath2 , at two different radii : @xmath147 ( @xmath148 is the schwarzchild radius of the black hole ) and @xmath149 .",
    "the accretion rate is @xmath150 m@xmath2/yr .",
    "the temperature and density profiles so obtained are plotted in fig.([fig : effecttp ] ) .",
    "we see that turbulent pressure makes the disc thicker , as expected intuitively . actually , according to eq.([eq : eh2 ] ) , the density gradient is lowered with turbulent pressure and the transition from the ambient medium to the disc interior is softer .",
    "the flux gradient depending on the density to a positive power |in the absence of convection at least| , a larger integration range is needed to obtain a zero net flux at the midplane , hence a thicker disc .",
    "the effect is specially visible at @xmath149 , with a @xmath151 disc thickening ( measured on @xmath152 ; we have @xmath153 on @xmath154 ) .",
    "the disc flaring therefore increases by the same relative quantity .",
    "since we have not explored the whole parameter space , it is probably easy to find cases where the effect is more important .",
    "the total surface density is almost unchanged ( a @xmath155 increase only ) . at @xmath156 ,",
    "the disc thickening is less important , about @xmath157 .",
    "note in this example the presence of a density inversion which occurs well below the base of the atmosphere .",
    "it tends to be washed out by turbulent pressure , as argued in sect.2.3 .",
    "the way turbulent pressure acts on both the temperature and density at the midplane temperature is however less straightforward and depends intimately on the vertical stratification . for a given effective temperature ,",
    "a disc with a larger surface density would theoretically have a hotter core .",
    "but this happens only in the calculation at @xmath156 , and the effect is very minor .",
    "we have checked that the conclusions derived here - above are qualitatively unchanged using @xmath57 ( see sect .",
    "4.5 for another effect of turbulent pressure ) .",
    "we will not discuss the case of circumstellar discs because values of the @xmath0-parameter currently adopted for these systems are rather very low ( typically @xmath158 ; dalessio , calvet & hartmann , 1997 ) and so , no effect of turbulent pressure is indeed observable .",
    "this has been verified .      in this paragraph , we show a few differences between @xmath56 and @xmath57 . convection is taken into account and turbulent pressure is left aside . the midplane temperature , total surface density , disc thickness and disc mass are plotted versus radius in fig.([fig : rprofyso ] ) for @xmath159 m@xmath2 , @xmath160 m@xmath2/yr and @xmath161 .",
    "these parameter values are typical of discs around t - tauri stars ( dalessio , calvet & hartmann , 1997 ) .",
    "the disc mass @xmath162 is @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the inner edge of the disc ( unimportant as long as @xmath165 ) .",
    "results computed without self - gravity are also shown in comparison .",
    "we see that , in the non self - gravitating region , differences on the geometrical thickness and midplane temperature are small , the disc being slightly thicker and hotter with @xmath56 than with @xmath57 .",
    "the most important effect is on the surface density and consequently on the disc mass : the @xmath56-prescription leads to slightly more massive disc than the @xmath57-prescription ( by a factor @xmath166 here ) .",
    "we see that the disc is definitely affected by self - gravity from approximately @xmath167 au whatever the viscosity law ( in fact , a little bit less with @xmath56 which agrees with the fact that that prescription leads to more massive discs , as long as @xmath168 ) .",
    "let us remind that the importance of self - gravity can be measured by the quantity ( see eq.([eq : eh1 ] ) ) @xmath169 which remains finite at @xmath170 as a taylor expansion shows .",
    "it follows that a `` natural '' definition for the limit between the standard disc and the self - gravitating disc can be @xmath171 at the midplane ( if @xmath172 then the disc contribution to gravity exceeds that due to the central object , vertically ) .    on the example",
    ", the disc thickness goes through a maximum near 10 au for both viscosity laws . beyond this radius ,",
    "the disc becomes thinner and thinner .",
    "regions located farther away can therefore not intercept photons emitted at the center .",
    "interestingly , the temperature and the surface density show very different behaviors . with law",
    "@xmath56 , the temperature decreases monotonically as @xmath11 increases , almost as in the absence of self - gravity .",
    "so does the total surface density .",
    "the midplane density , not shown on graphs , gently increases with the radius .",
    "note that @xmath173 ( and @xmath162 ) are surprisingly not affected by self - gravity .",
    "the origin of this insensitivity has not been identified at the time being .",
    "conversely , with law @xmath57 , the surface density and the density violently increase with the radius .",
    "the disc thickness falls in also very rapidly .",
    "the temperature reaches a plateau .",
    "in fact , this somewhat `` singular '' behavior is predicted by the vertically averaged model ( shlosman & belgelman , 1987 ; hur et al .",
    "1994a ; hur , 1998 ; see also duschl , biermann & strittmatter , 2000 ) . in particular , the temperature @xmath174 at the plateau is mainly fixed by the ratio @xmath175 , namely @xmath176 for @xmath177 m@xmath2/yr as in fig.([fig : rprofyso ] ) , eq.([psgtg ] ) yields @xmath178 k ( assuming @xmath179 ) . although this value is derived from the one zone model , it is in good agreement with the vertical structure computation which gives a plateau at about @xmath180 k. note that the drastic increase of the surface density produces an important increase of the disc mass which even exceeds the value obtained with law @xmath56 . when @xmath181 ( this occurs at @xmath182 au on the example ) , the disc becomes very self - gravitating , probably gravitationally unstable ( goldreich & lynden - bell , 1965 ; shu et al . ,",
    "1990 ) and should therefore not be well described with current viscosities ( e.g. lin & pringle , 1987 ) nor by steady state solutions ( goldreich & lynden - bell , 1965 ) .",
    "one reaches here the limit of the model .",
    "it is however interesting to note that , asymptotically , there is either a hot very dense solution or a cold more diffuse solution ( see paczyski , 1978 ) .    the same quantities obtained under the same conditions but for an agn disc with @xmath146 m@xmath2",
    ", @xmath183 m@xmath2/yr and @xmath184 are displayed in fig.([fig : rprofagn ] ) .",
    "globally , we find similar trends .",
    "the singular behavior observed in the previous example with @xmath57 inside the self - gravitating regime seems even stronger .",
    "self - gravitation becomes important from about @xmath156 .",
    "the midplane temperature stabilizes radially at @xmath185 k. this value again compares quite well with eq.([psgtg ] ) which gives @xmath186 k ( assuming @xmath187 ) . the presence of extremely steep surface density and density radial gradients probably means that the assumption made on the disc potential ( see sect .",
    "2.1 ) is no longer valid .",
    "this would be worthwhile to check .",
    "the physical picture there is then that of a disc surrounded by a very dense ring ( @xmath21 increases by more than one order of magnitude over a relative length @xmath188 ) which contains almost all the disc mass and angular momentum . when @xmath189 ( beyond a few @xmath190 for law @xmath57 ) , effects of self - gravity are expected to be global , with a change in the rotation law .",
    "all these results require a few comments .",
    "first , it is important to note that the effect of self - gravity is slightly underestimated when it is neglected in the computations .",
    "this is specially true with law @xmath57 .",
    "besides , self - gravity becomes important before @xmath191 reaches unity , like in the one zone model ( hur , 1998 ) . at the inner edge of the self - gravitating disc ( that is at @xmath171 following our definition ) ,",
    "the disc mass is much less than the central mass : we find @xmath192 ( depending on the viscosity law ) in the yso case , and @xmath193 in the agn case .",
    "this suggests that low mass discs must not be automatically classified as non self - gravitating discs as often asserted .",
    "in particular , it is not excluded that t - tauri discs we observe be subject to vertical self - gravity , despite their relatively low mass ( beckwith et al . ,",
    "1990 ) .",
    "it has been stated in sect .",
    "2.4 that the relation between @xmath56 and @xmath57 is not trivial . in the non self - gravitating parts however , midplane temperatures @xmath194 show a striking quasi - parallel variation with the radius in logarithmic scales ( this is also true for quantities @xmath173 and @xmath152 ) , which could be attributed to the fact that @xmath56 is indeed proportional to @xmath57 ( or one goes from one solution to the other by a change of @xmath0 ; see power law solutions for @xmath0-discs ) . to demonstrate that these two viscosity prescriptions are intrinsically different ( as suggested by what happens in the self - gravitating regions ) ,",
    "we have computed the ratio @xmath195 with @xmath56 , for the examples discussed above .",
    "we have chosen two radii , the one lies in the classical disc part , the other is in the self - gravitating part .",
    "the results are shown in fig.([fig : deltanu ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      we show in fig.([fig : psn ] ) the density field within a circumstellar disc for the same parameter values as in fig.([fig : rprofyso ] ) .",
    "this simulation has been carried out using @xmath56 and @xmath57 as well , including convection , self - gravity and turbulent pressure .",
    "we also indicate iso - contours of the temperature , the limit between gas pressure dominated zones and radiative pressure dominated ones , and lines where @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "we notice that the density and the temperature show strong variations in between the midplane to the photosphere s base and we are far from a vertically isothermal , homogenous disc as often considered .",
    "note , specially for viscosity law @xmath56 , the re - increase of the midplane density in the radial direction ( another density inversion ) as self - gravity gains in importance .",
    "it is remarkable that self - gravity does not appear suddenly ( i.e. on a small radial range ) but installs gently and steadily over a very extended domain .",
    "for instance , with law @xmath57 , it contibutes by @xmath198 in the hydrostatic equilibrium near @xmath199 au and by @xmath200 at about 7 au , and all disc quantities are significantly modified over this domain .",
    "we see clearly that the disc density is slightly smaller with @xmath57 than with @xmath56 ( same color code for both maps ) .",
    "we notice that the whole disc is optically very thick , due to its large surface density .",
    "it is then likely that a mean external heating should not change noticeably the temperature and density at the midplane . from this point of view",
    ", the neglect of irradiation is entirely justified .",
    "it is interesting to see that , as long as an @xmath0-model can be applied to the solar nebula ( e.g. ruden & pollack , 1991 ; papaloizou & terquem , 1999 ; drouart et al , 1999 ) , our giant planets ( displayed on graphs ) lie inside the self - gravitating part of the disc ( this is true whatever the accretion rate , but depends on the @xmath0-parameter ; see the next section ) . as already noticed ( ruden & pollack , 1991 ) ,",
    "this coincidence is somewhat striking and we do not know to what extent self - gravity could have played a role in the process of the formation of outer planet and other objects ( lissauer , 1993 ) .",
    "similar 2d - maps are displayed in fig.([fig : agn ] ) for an agn disc with @xmath146 m@xmath2 , @xmath183 m@xmath2/yr and @xmath201 , using the same color table .",
    "note the existence of an inner radiative pressure dominated region at @xmath202 , common for agn discs as well as the great steepness of density gradients near the surface which may cause numerical difficulties .",
    "also visible is the density inversion at @xmath203 which has less amplitude and is less extended radially in the presence of convection and turbulent pressure .",
    "we see on both figs.([fig : psn ] ) and ( [ fig : agn ] ) that @xmath204 and iso - values of @xmath205 form very curved lines ( `` diabolo''-shape surfaces in 3d ) .",
    "this is important if one wishes to estimate correctly the position of the self - gravitating regime .",
    "for instance , in the case of the law @xmath56 discussed in fig.([fig : psn ] ) , @xmath171 in the midplane at 7 au ( we have @xmath206 in the agn case depicted in fig.([fig : agn ] ) ) whereas this occurs in the disc atmosphere at about twice the distance .    for many purposes , it is interesting to know the position of the ( vertically ) self - gravitating disc .",
    "that is why we have performed a systematic computation to find the radius @xmath207 satisfying @xmath208 as a function of the accretion rate , for 4 values of the @xmath0-parameter in the range @xmath209 , and for @xmath159 m@xmath2 and @xmath146 m@xmath2 .",
    "these parameter values should cover a wide variety of circumstellar discs and agn discs .",
    "the calculations have been performed with @xmath57 including convection , self - gravitation , with and without turbulent pressure ( the use of @xmath56 would systematically give a slightly lower value of @xmath207 ) .",
    "the results are plotted in fig.([fig : zetayso ] ) for parameter values typical of circumstellar discs .",
    "we see that the location of self - gravitating regime is very sensitive to the viscosity parameter .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath0 , the further away the self - gravitating region . regarding the sensitivity to the accretion rate",
    ", there are three different trends . for @xmath210 , the lower @xmath112 , the larger @xmath207 . for @xmath211 ,",
    "the dependence is rather weak : @xmath212 au . for higher values of the viscosity parameter ( generally not appropriate to fit properties of observed discs ) ,",
    "@xmath207 is an increasing function of @xmath112 .",
    "note also that turbulent pressure , when important , slightly increases @xmath207 ( @xmath213 in the example for @xmath145 and the highest accretion rate ) .",
    "results for agn discs are shown in fig.([fig : zetaagn ] ) .",
    "as above , large viscosity parameters imply wider non self - gravitating inner disc ( because discs are less dense with large values of the @xmath0-parameter ) , and turbulent pressure pushes further away the self - gravitating regime . for @xmath214 , we have @xmath215 cm .",
    "the sensitivity to the accretion rate remains weak . for higher values of the viscosity parameter and for very low to moderate accretion rates ( @xmath216 m@xmath2/yr , depending on @xmath0 ) , @xmath207 globally decreases as @xmath112 increases . for higher accretion rates , @xmath207 increases as @xmath112 increases and self - gravity is important within the radiative pressure dominated region .",
    "it is important to notify that the `` toomre s criterion '' ( @xmath217 ) is an helpful tool to trace regions where some gravitational instabilities occur in a stellar disc ( toomre , 1965 ) , but it differs significantly from the criterion derived by goldreich & lynden - bell ( 1965 ) for gaseous discs ( @xmath218 ) . besides , @xmath219 is commonly written in different forms which are not strictly equivalent ( e.g. , ruden & pollack , 1991 ; sincell & krolik , 1997 ; dalessio , calvet & hartmann , 1997 , papaloizou & terquem , 1999 ) , specially in a 2d - model .",
    "althought these @xmath220-parameters are undisputably related to the @xmath191-parameter in some ways ( for instance , @xmath221 and @xmath222 ) , they must be used with care if one wishes to check the importance of self - gravity .",
    "they may lead to noticeable over - estimates of @xmath207 , specially if , as it is always the case , the @xmath219-parameter is computed from models that discards self - gravity .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.([fig : zetaq ] ) where we have plotted values of @xmath191 at three key altitudes and @xmath219 versus the radius .",
    "it seems therefore preferable to make the check on @xmath223 rather than on any other quantities , otherwise the importance of self - gravity is under - estimated .",
    "in this article , we have presented the equations accounting for the vertical structure of steady state keplerian accretion discs , including simultaneously turbulent pressure , convective transport in the framework of the mixing length theory , and the disc self - gravity within the infinite slab approximation .",
    "the emphasis has been placed on outer regions where vertical self - gravity becomes increasingly influencal .",
    "we have shown that turbulent pressure makes the disc thicker , but it can be neglected if @xmath224 .",
    "also , self - gravity may be important even if the disc mass is very low compared to the central object , contrary to usual assertions .",
    "further , the transition from the classical disc to the self - gravitating disc takes place gradually and so , concerns a large radial domain .    another important conclusion of this work is that the model of mechanical energy deposition towards the vertical direction is crucial .",
    "this is not surprising since viscosity is the source of heating and accretion .",
    "two different behaviors are predicted inside the self - gravitating ( and gravitationally unstable ) region . on the one hand ,",
    "the @xmath225-formalism yields a solution which is asymptotically cold and diffuse , whereas the local version of the standard prescription gives a more `` singular '' solution , asymptotically hot and dense , which is also predicted by the vertically averaged model .",
    "we can imagine that a suitable choice for the function @xmath226 should provide any intermediate solution , meaning that this model for outer regions has almost no predictive power .",
    "although the present stationary keplerian disc model is probably irrelevant to describe the disc structure in its strongly self - gravitating parts , the existence of two asymptotically distinct solutions might indicate that the outer disc can get into , either a flat and cold configuration where fragmentation and formation of indiviual clouds ( kumar , 1999 ) and compact objects like planets and stars ( collin & zahn , 1999 ) could occur , or into a thick diffuse configuration ( a torus ) ( paczynski , 1978 ) .",
    "time dependent simulations should shed light on this question .",
    "this study confirms that discs around super - massive black holes are self - gravitating close to the center , beyond a few hundreds schwarzchild radii , depending on the central mass accretion rate and @xmath0-parameter .",
    "we have found that the disc surface density remains high when self - gravity dominates and that the disc mass definitely rises outwards .",
    "let us remind that a current problem with the fueling of active nuclei is that the accretion time scale @xmath227 is usually much too long at large radii , that is why other more efficient mechanisms are invoked ( frank , 1990 ) .",
    "however , given the sensitivity of the disc structure to viscosity , it is not excluded that depth dependent viscosity laws other than considered here would lead to smaller surface density distributions , and consequently to shorter accretion time scales .",
    "it is therefore important to test other models for the energy deposition along the @xmath12-axis as well as other kinds of viscosity prescriptions ( lin & pringle , 1987 ; cannizzo & cameron , 1988 ; richard & zahn , 1999 ; see hur & richard , 2000 ) .    with accretion rates and values of the viscosity parameter",
    "usually considered to model discs in t - tauri stars , we conclude that our giant planets ( if not jupiter , the other ones ) were probably formed within the self - gravitating part of the solar nebula ( drouart et al .",
    "this is a fortiori true if these objects experienced any inward migration .",
    "more generally , as long as the @xmath0-theory may be applied to describe the inner parts of circumstellar discs around forming stars , self - gravity is expected to play a role at about ten au from the center .",
    "this is not uncompatible with the discs we observed ( beckwith et al . ,",
    "1990 ) .",

    "<S> we show the strong sensitivity of the disc structure to the viscous energy deposition towards the vertical axis , specially when entering inside the self - gravitating part of the disc . the local version of the @xmath0-prescription leads to a `` singular '' behavior which is also predicted by the vertically averaged model : there is an extremely violent density and surface density runaway , a rapid disc collapse and a temperature plateau . </S>",

    "<S> turbulent pressure is important only for @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> this study suggests that models aiming to describe t - tauri discs beyond about a few to a few tens astronomical units ( depending on the viscosity parameter ) from the central protostar using the @xmath0-theory should consider vertical self - gravity , but additional heating mechanisms are necessary to account for large discs . </S>",
