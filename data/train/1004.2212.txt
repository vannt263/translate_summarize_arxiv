    "optical ( @xmath10 4400 - 5400  ) emission is one of the most interesting features in agn spectra .",
    "the emission arises from numerous transitions of the complex ion .",
    "emission is seen in almost all type-1 agn spectra and it is especially strong in narrow - line seyfert 1s ( nls1s ) .",
    "it can also appear in the polarized flux of type-2 agns when a hidden blr can be seen .",
    "origin of the optical lines , the mechanisms of their excitation and location of the emission region in agn , are still open questions .",
    "there are also many correlations between emission and other agn properties which need a physical explanation .",
    "some of the problems connected with emission are :    \\1 .",
    "there have been suggestions that emission can not be explained with standard photoionization models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "to explain the emission , additional mechanisms of excitation have been proposed : a ) continuum fluorescence @xcite , b ) collisional excitation @xcite , c ) self - fluorescence among transitions @xcite , d ) fluorescent excitation by the ly@xmath4 and ly@xmath3 lines @xcite .",
    "there are uncertainties about where the emission line region is located in an agn .",
    "a few proposed solutions are that the lines arise : a ) in the same emission region as the broad h@xmath3 line @xcite , b ) in the accretion disk near the central black hole , which produces the double - peaked broad balmer emission lines @xcite , c ) in a region which can be heated by shocks or from an inflow , located between blr and nlr  the so - called the intermediate line region @xcite and d ) and in the shielded , neutral , outer region of a flattened blr @xcite .",
    "it has long been established that the emission is correlated with the radio , x and ir continuum .",
    "lines are stronger in spectra of radio quiet ( rq ) agns , than in radio loud ( rl ) objects @xcite .",
    "but , if we consider rl agns , emission is stronger in core dominant ( cd ) agns than in lobe dominant ( ld ) agns @xcite .",
    "the relative strength of the lines correlates with the soft x - ray slope , but anti - correlates with x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "strong optical emission is usually associated with strong ir luminosity @xcite , but it is anti - correlated with ir color index @xmath4(60,25 ) @xcite .",
    "many correlations have been observed between and other emission lines . @xcite",
    "give a number of correlations between the equivalent width ( ew ) of and properties of the [ ] and h@xmath3 lines .",
    "the most interesting are the anti - correlations of ew vs. ew [ ] /ew h@xmath3 , ew vs. peak [ ] , ew /ew",
    "h@xmath3 vs. peak [ ] , and the correlation of ew /ew",
    "h@xmath3 vs. h@xmath3 asymmetry .",
    "an anti - correlation between ew and fwhm of h@xmath3 has been also found @xcite .",
    "these correlations dominate the first eigenvector of the principal component analysis of @xcite ( hereinafter ev1 ) .",
    "correlations between ev1 and some properties of c iv @xmath11   lines have also been pointed out @xcite . with increasing continuum luminosity , the ew of the c iv lines decreases , ( the so - called  baldwin effect ",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the blueshift of the c iv line and the ew of increase .",
    "recently , @xcite have found the baldwin effect to be related to ev1 .",
    "lines are usually strong in agn spectra with low - ionization broad absorption lines ( bals ) @xcite .    searching for",
    "a physical cause of these correlations may help in understanding of the origin of emission .",
    "some of physical properties which may influence these correlations are : eddington ratio ( l/@xmath12 ) @xcite , black hole mass ( @xmath13 ) and inclination angle @xcite .",
    "in addition to these properties , emission strength may vary with evolution of agns .",
    "for example , @xcite have explained some properties of agn ( as bals , strength , radio properties , emission line width , luminosity of narrow lines , etc . ) by an `` evolutive unification model '' . in this model",
    ", accretion arises from the interaction between nuclear starbursts and the supermassive black hole .",
    "this would mean that not only the orientation , but also the evolutionary state of an agn , influence its spectral properties .",
    "thus , young agn have strong , bals , weak radio emission , the nlr is compact and faint , and broad lines are relatively narrow .",
    "in contrast with this , old agns have weak , no bals , strong radio emission with extended radio lobes , the nlr is extended and bright , and the broad lines have greater velocity widths .    in this paper , we investigate the emitting region by analyzing the correlations between the optical lines and the other emission lines in a sample of 302 agn from the sdss . to do this we construct an template .",
    "the strongest multiplets within the @xmath104400 - 5500   range are sorted into three groups , according to the lower terms of the transitions : @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( which we will hereinafter refer to as the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 groups of lines ) .",
    "the @xmath17 group mainly contains the lines from the multiplets 37 and 38 and describes the blue part of the shelf relative to h@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath18 group of lines describes the part of emission under h@xmath3 and [ ] and contains lines from multiples 41 , 42 and 43 .",
    "finally , the @xmath19 group contains lines from multiplets 48 and 49 , and describes the red part of the shelf . a simplified grotrian diagram of these transitions is shown in figure [ 1 ] .",
    "we analyze separately their relationships with other lines in agn spectra ( h@xmath3 , [ ] , h@xmath4 , [ ] ) . in this way",
    ", we try to connect details of the emission with physical properties of the agn emission regions in which these lines arise .",
    "each of the multiplet groups has specific characteristics , which may be reflected in a different percent of correlations with other lines , and give us more information about the complex emission region .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we describe the procedure of sample selection and details of analysis ; our results are presented in sect .",
    "3 ; in sect .",
    "4 we give discussion of obtained results , and finally in sect .",
    "5 we outline our conclusions .",
    "spectra for our data sample are taken from the the @xmath20 data release @xcite of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . for the purposes of the work , we chose agns with the following characteristics :    1 .",
    "high signal to noise ratio ( @xmath21 ) , 2 .",
    "good pixel quality ( profiles are not affected by distortions due to bad pixels on the sensors , the presence of strong foreground or background sources ) , 3 .   high redshift confidence ( zconf@xmath220.95 ) and with @xmath23 in order to cover the optical lines around h@xmath3 and [ ] lines , 4 .   negligible contribution from the stellar component .",
    "we controlled for this by having the ews of typical absorption lines be less then 1   ( ew cak 3934  , mg 5177   and h@xmath24 4102 @xmath22 - 1 ) . because of this it was not necessary to remove a host galaxy starlight contribution .",
    "presence of the narrow [ ] and the broad h@xmath3 component ( fwhm @xmath25 ) .",
    "we found 497 agns using the mentioned criteria .",
    "however , on inspection of the spectra we found that in some of them the line emission is within the level of noise and could not be properly fitted , so we excluded these objects from further analysis ( see appendix a ) .",
    "as result , our final sample contains 302 spectra , from which 137 have all balmer lines , and the rest are without the h@xmath4 line ( due to cosmological redshifts ) .",
    "the sample distribution by continuum luminosity ( @xmath26 5100  ) and by cosmological redshift is given in figure [ 3 ] .",
    "corrections for galactic extinction were made using an empirical selective extinction function computed for each spectrum on the basis of galactic extinction coefficients given by @xcite and available from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database . finally , all spectra were de - redshifted .",
    "to subtract the continuum , we used the dipso software , finding the continuum level by using continuum windows given in the paper of @xcite ( see figure [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the used continuum windows are : 3010 - 3040  , 3240 - 3270  , 3790 - 3810  , 4210 - 4230  , 5080 - 5100  , 5600 - 5630   and 5970 - 6000  .",
    "we used the same procedure to subtract the continuum in all objects .",
    "continuum subtraction may cause systemic errors in the estimation of line parameters and continuum luminosity .",
    "we estimated that the error bars are smaller than 5% , especially within the h@xmath4+[n ii ] region and in the red part of the `` iron shelf '' .",
    "we considered two spectral ranges : @xmath10 4400 - 5500   and @xmath10 6400 - 6800  . in the first range , dominant lines are the numerous lines , [ ] @xmath104959 , 5007  , h@xmath3 and he ii @xmath264686  , and in the second range , h@xmath4 and [ ] @xmath106548 , 6583  .    to investigate correlations between the multiplets and other lines in spectra , we fit all considered lines with gaussians",
    ". the optical lines were fitted with a template calculated as described in the next section .",
    "a number of authors have created an template in the uv and optical range ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite applied empirical template by removing all lines which are not , from the spectrum of i zw 1 .",
    "similarly , @xcite constructed an template by identifying systems of broad and of narrow lines in the i zw 1 spectrum , and measuring their relative intensities .",
    "@xcite improve on that template by using two parameters of intensity - one for the broad , one for the narrow lines .",
    "all these empirical templates are defined by the line width and the line strength , implying that relative strengths of the lines in the multiplets are the same in all objects .    in theoretical modeling",
    ", significant effort has been made to calculate the iron emission by including a large number of atomic levels , going to high energy @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated emission using cloudy code and 830 level model . in this model , energies go up to 14.6 ev , producing 344,035 atomic transitions . for their calculations they used solar abundances for a range of physical conditions such as the flux of ionizing photons [ @xmath27 , hydrogen density [ @xmath28 , and microturbulence [ @xmath29 .    using existing templates",
    ", we found that empirical and theoretical models can generally fit nlsy1 lines well , but that in some cases of spectra with broader h@xmath3 lines , the existing models did not provide as good fit .",
    "one of the problems in the analysis of emission is that it consists of numerous overlapping lines .",
    "this makes the identification and determination of relative intensities very difficult .",
    "therefore , the list of lines used for the fit of the emission , as well as their relative intensities , are different in different models @xcite .",
    "also , there is significant disagreement in values of oscillator strengths in different atomic data sources @xcite .    to investigate the emission",
    ", we made an template taking into account following : ( a ) majority of multiplets dominant in the optical part ( @xmath10 4400 - 5500  ) , whose lines can be clearly identified in agn spectra , have one of the three specific lower terms of their transitions : @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 , and ( b ) beside these lines there are also lines whose origin is not well known but which presumably originate from higher levels .",
    "we constructed an template consisting of 50 emission lines , identified as the strongest within @xmath10 4400 - 5500   range .",
    "35 of them are sorted into three line groups according to the lower term of their transition ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the @xmath17 group consists of 19 lines ( mainly multiplets 37 and 38 ) and dominates in the blue shelf of the iron template ( 4400 - 4700  ) .",
    "the @xmath18 group consists of 5 lines ( multiplets 41 , 42 and 43 ) and describes the emission covering the [ ] and h@xmath3 region of the spectrum and some of emission from the red bump ( 5150 - 5400  ) , and the @xmath19 lines ( 11 lines from multiplets 48 and 49 ) dominate in the red bump ( 5150 - 5400  ) ( see figure [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the profiles of each of lines can be represented by a gaussian , described by width ( @xmath30 ) , shift ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the doppler width , @xmath34 is the shift and @xmath35 is the velocity dispersion ] and intensity ( @xmath36 ) . since all lines from the template probably originate in the same region , with the same kinematical properties , values of @xmath31 and @xmath30 are assumed to be the same for all lines in the case of one agn .",
    "since the population of the lower term is influenced by transition probabilities and excitation temperature , we assumed that the relative intensities between lines within a line group ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) can be obtained approximately from : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the intensities of lines with the same lower term , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the wavelengths of the transition , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the statistical weights for the upper energy levels , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the oscillator strengths , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the energies of the upper levels of transitions , @xmath48 is the boltzman constant , and @xmath49 is the excitation temperature .",
    "details can be found in appendix c. the excitation temperature is the same for all transitions in the case of partial lte ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but as it is shown in appendix c , eq ( 1 ) may be used also in some non - lte cases .",
    "lines from the three above mentioned groups explain about 75% of the emission in the observed range ( 4400 - 5500  ) , but about 25% of emission can not be explained with permitted lines for which the excitation energies are close to the lines of the three groups .",
    "the missing emission is around @xmath84450  , @xmath84630  , @xmath85130   and @xmath85370  .",
    "there are some indications that fluorescence processes may have a role in producing some lines @xcite .",
    "process like self - fluorescence , continuum - fluorescence or ly@xmath4 and ly@xmath3 pumping could supply enough energy to excite the lines with high energy of excitation , which could be one of the explanation for emission within these wavelength regions . to complete the template for approximately of 25% missing flux , we selected 15 lines from the kurutz database with wavelengths close to those of the extra emission , upper level excitation energies of up to @xmath813 ev , and strong oscillator strengths .",
    "we measured their relative intensities in i zw 1 which has a well - studied spectrum @xcite spectrum with strong and narrow lines .",
    "relative intensities of these 15 lines were obtained by making the best fit of the i zw 1 spectrum with the lines from the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 line groups .",
    "the extra lines are represented in figure [ 1 ] ( bottom ) , with a dotted line .",
    "our template of is described by 7 free fitting parameters : width , shift , four parameters of intensity ( for the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 line groups and for the lines with relative intensities obtained from i zw 1 ) .",
    "the seventh parameter is the excitation temperature included in the calculation of relative intensities within @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 line groups .",
    "we found that for the majority of objects , the excitation temperature obtained from our fit is within the range : 9000 k ",
    "11000 k ( see figure [ 4 ] ) , which agrees well with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "however , as it could be seen in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , our fit is not very sensitive to the temperature , especially for t@xmath228000 k. eq .",
    "( 1 ) is also very approximate so estimated temperatures should be treated with caution .",
    "to estimate the error in the excitation temperature , we found our best fit for a number of objects .",
    "we then changed only the excitation temperature while keeping the other fit parameters fixed .",
    "we thus found @xmath50 for which the fit is still reasonable .",
    "after that , we constructed @xmath51 vs. @xmath49 and measured the dispersion in temperature at 0.1@xmath52(@xmath50-@xmath53 ) .",
    "we obtained error - bars that were mostly within the range @xmath54 , with tendency for higher temperature to have a greater uncertainty . in",
    "further analysis we will therefore not consider the temperatures obtained from the fit .    the wavelengths of the 50 template lines are presented in tables [ tbl-1 ] and [ tbl-2 ] . for the 35 lines from the three line groups we give multiplet names , configurations of the transitions generating those lines , oscillator strengths and the relative intensities .",
    "the intensities have been calculated using the eq .",
    "( 1 ) for excitation temperatures @xmath49 = 5000 , 10000 and 15000 k ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) . for the 15 lines for which relative intensities were measured in i zw 1 , we give wavelengths , configurations and oscillator strengths taken from kurucz database , as well as their measured relative intensities ( table [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "the purpose of dividing the emission into four groups is to investigate the correlations between the iron lines which arise from different multiplets and some spectral properties , and to compare it with results obtained for the total within the observed range .",
    "also , a template which has more parameters may give a better fit , since relative intensities among lines can be different even in the similar agn spectra , as is , for example , the case for spectra of i zw 1 and mrk 42 ( as e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we applied this template to our sample of 302 agns from sdss database , and we compare it with other theoretical and empirical models ( see appendix b ) .",
    "we found that the template fit emission very well ( figure [ 5 ] and figure [ 6 ] ) . in the cases when the emission of an object has different properties from i zw",
    "1 , small disagreements are noticed in the lines for which the relative intensity was obtained from i zw 1 .",
    "however , the emission in these objects shows larger disagreement with the empirical and theoretical models considered in appendix b ( see figure [ 7 ] ) .",
    "although our template has more free parameters than other templates used for fitting the emission , it enables more precise fit of lines in some agns ( especially with very broad h@xmath3 line ) than the other templates we considered .",
    "we assume that broad emission lines arise in two or more emission regions @xcite , so that their profiles are sums of gaussians with different shifts , widths and intensities , which reflect the physical conditions of the emitting regions where the components arise .    for this reason",
    ", we fit the emission lines we considered ( [ ] @xmath104959 , 5007  , h@xmath3 , he ii",
    "@xmath264686  , h@xmath4 and [ ] @xmath106548 , 6583  ) with a sum of gaussians , describing one gaussian with 3 parameters ( width , intensity and shift from transition wavelength ) .",
    "both lines of the [ ] @xmath104959 , 5007   doublet originate from the same lower energy level and both have a negligible optical depth since the transitions are strongly forbidden . taking this into account",
    ", we assumed that the [ ] @xmath264959   and [ ] @xmath265007   lines have the same emission - line profile .",
    "we fit each line of the doublet with either a single gaussian , or , in the case of a significant asymmetry , with two gausssians .",
    "the gaussian that describes the [ ] @xmath264959  , has the same width and shift , as the one which describes [ ] @xmath265007   line , and we took their intensity ratio to be 2.99 @xcite .",
    "[ ] @xmath106548 , 6583   were fitted using the same procedure , with an intensity ratio of the doublet components of @xmath55 .",
    "the he ii @xmath264686",
    "  line was fitted with one broad gaussian .    to fit the balmer lines a number of gaussian functions were used for each line .",
    "it is usually assumed that there are two components for h@xmath4 and h@xmath3 : a narrow component representing the nlr , and a broad one representing the blr .",
    "however , the broad emission lines ( bels ) , are very complex and can not be properly explained by single gaussian ( which would indicate an isotropic spherical region ) . moreover , there are some papers @xcite where the broad lines are assumed to be emitted from two kinematicaly different regions : a `` very broad line region '' ( vblr ) , and an `` intermediate line region '' ( ilr ) .",
    "we therefore tested fitting the broad lines with one and two gaussians .",
    "we found that in most agns in our sample , the fit with two gaussians was significantly better than the fit with one gaussian .    to apply a uniform model of the line fitting procedure , we assumed that balmer lines have three components from the nlr , ilr and vblr .",
    "we exclude 4 spectra from the sample in which h@xmath4 line could not be decomposed in this way , so finally our sample contains 133 spectra ( from 137 ) with all balmer lines which could be analyzed within the @xmath10 6400 - 6800   range . to check this assumption on the rest of the spectra",
    ", we examined the corresponding correlations and we found that the luminosities and widths of the nlr , ilr and vblr components of h@xmath4 are highly correlated with the same parameters of the nlr , ilr and vblr components of h@xmath3 .",
    "this is in favor of our three component decomposition ( table [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "for the 133 objects , which have both h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 lines , it can be noticed that 16 spectra have large redshifts of the vblr h@xmath3 component relative to vblr of h@xmath4 , which causes disagreement and reduces the correlation between the vblr shifts of the rest of objects . without these 16 objects , h@xmath3 and h@xmath4",
    "vblr components correlate in width and shift , with coefficient of correlation @xmath56 , p @xmath57 0.0001 .",
    "an example of shifts between the h@xmath4 and h@xmath3 vblr components is shown in figure [ 8 ] .",
    "the agn sdss j@xmath58 has its vblr h@xmath3 component redshifted by @xmath594258 @xmath9 , while shift of the h@xmath4 vblr component is @xmath59 - 1200 @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that all narrow lines ( and narrow components of the broad lines ) , originate from the same nlr , and thus expect that these lines will have the same shifts and widths .",
    "we therefore took the gaussian parameters of the shift and width of [ ] , [ ] , and the nlr components of h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 to have the same values .",
    "we separately fit lines from the @xmath10 4400 - 5500   range ( lines , [ ] , he ii and h@xmath3 ) with 23 free parameters , and lines from the @xmath10 6400 - 6800   range ( h@xmath4 and [ ] ) with 8 free parameters .",
    "we applied a @xmath60 minimization routine @xcite , to obtain the best fit .",
    "examples of an agn spectrum fit in both ranges are shown in figure [ 9 ] and figure [ 10 ] .",
    "we compared the shifts , widths , equivalent widths , and luminosities of the lines .",
    "the shifts and widths were obtained directly from the fit ( parameters of width and shift ) .",
    "luminosities were calculated using the formulae given in @xcite , with adopted cosmological parameters : @xmath61 = 0.27 , @xmath62 = 0.73 and @xmath63 = 0 .",
    "we adopt a hubble constant , @xmath64 .",
    "the continuum luminosity was obtained from the average value of continuum flux measured between 5100   ( @xmath105095 - 5100   and @xmath105100 - 5105  ) .",
    "equivalent widths were measured with respect to the continuum below the lines .",
    "the continuum was estimated by subtracting all fitted lines from the observed spectra .",
    "then , the line of interest ( or the template ) , which is fit separately , is added to the continuum .",
    "equivalent widths are obtained by normalizing the lines on continuum level , and measuring their fluxes ( see figure [ 11 ] ) . to determine the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the broad component of the balmer lines , the vblr and ilr components from the fit are considered as it is shown in figure [ 11_2 ] .",
    "the broad balmer line ( vblr+ilr ) is then normalized on unity , and the fwhm is measured at half of the maximum intensity .",
    "some objects have relative intensities of lines similar to i zw 1 , while others show significant disagreement , which usually shows up as stronger iron emission in the blue bump ( mainly @xmath17 lines ) than one in the red bump ( mainly @xmath19 lines ) , comparing to i zw 1 . that objects could be fitted well with the template model which assumes that relative intensities between the lines from different line groups ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) are different for different objects .",
    "difference between the relative intensities of the lines from different parts of iron shelf ( blue , red and central ) can be illustrated well with histograms of distribution of the group ratio ( @xmath17/@xmath19 , @xmath17/@xmath18 and @xmath19/@xmath18 ) for the sample ( figure [ 12 ] ) .",
    "the average value of the @xmath65 luminosity ratio is 1.44@xmath660.55 , of the @xmath67 ratio 1.97@xmath661.05 , and of the @xmath68 ratio 1.39@xmath660.46 .",
    "we found that the majority of objects have group ratios close to the average values , but still significant number of objects are showing difference since the intensity ratios of line groups vary in different objects ( see figure [ 12 ] ) .",
    "the ratios of the line groups in i zw 1 are indicated by the vertical dashed lines ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "we analyzed the flux ratios of the multiplet groups and the total flux ( see histograms in figure [ fetot ] ) , and we found that lines from multiplets 37 and 38 ( group @xmath17 ) generally have the largest contribution to the total emission within the @xmath104400 - 5500   range ( about 32% ) , while group @xmath18 contributes about 18% and @xmath19 about 23% . as expected , there are very strong correlations between the equivalent widths of line groups ( table [ tbl-4 ] ) .    since line intensities and their ratios are indicators of physical properties of the plasma where those lines arise , we have investigated relations among the ratios of line groups with various spectral properties .",
    "a correlation between the fwhm h@xmath3 and the ew emission has been found previously @xcite .",
    "consequently , one can expect that fwhm h@xmath3 may be connected with the line group ratios .",
    "we therefore investigated correlations between the ratios of the groups ( @xmath65 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ) and h@xmath3 fwhm .",
    "we excluded the three outliers , which have negligible flux for @xmath18 group . as it can be seen in figure [ 13 ] ( first panel ) there are different trends for spectra with fwhm h@xmath3 less than and greater than @xmath83000 @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , we divided the sample into two sub - samples : 158 objects with fwhm h@xmath3 @xmath573000 @xmath9 and 141 objects with fwhm h@xmath3 @xmath223000 @xmath9 ( see figure [ 13 ] and table [ tbl-5 ] ) .",
    "a similar subdivision of agn samples was performed by @xcite , but for fwhm h@xmath72 as the limiting fwhm of the subdivision .",
    "we found that fwhm h@xmath73 is more a appropriate place to divide the objects into two groups , since all objects with strongly redshifted vblr h@xmath3 component ( see figure [ 8 ] ) belong to the fwhm h@xmath3",
    "@xmath223000 @xmath9 subsample .",

    "in spectra in which emission lines have different relative intensities than in i zw 1 , this template fit better than empirical and theoretical templates based on i zw 1 spectrum ( see more in appendix b ) . using this template , we are able to consider different groups of transitions which contribute to the blue , central and red part of shelf around the h@xmath3 + [ ] lines",
    "we find that the ratios of different parts of the iron shelf ( @xmath65 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ) depend of some spectral properties such as : continuum luminosity , h@xmath3 fwhm , shift of , and @xmath5/@xmath6 flux ratio .",
    "also , it is noticed that spectra with h@xmath3 fwhm greater and less than @xmath83000 @xmath9 have different properties which is reflected in significantly different coefficients of correlation between the parameters .",
    "we found that the emission is mainly characterized with a random velocity of @xmath81400 @xmath9 that corresponds to the ilr origin , which is also supported by the significant correlation between the width of and h@xmath4 , h@xmath3 ilr widths .",
    "this is in agreement with the previous investigations @xcite , but unlike the earlier investigations , we found a slight correlation with the width of vblr .",
    "therefore , it is possible that is partly produced in the vblr and can not be resolved from continuum luminosity",
    ". also , we found that the lines are slightly redshifted relative to the narrow lines ( @xmath8 100 @xmath9 ) ( see figure [ 18 ] ) .",
    "the balmer lines were decomposed into nlr , ilr and vblr components and relationships among h@xmath3 components and some spectral properties were investigated .",
    "we found a positive correlation between the width of narrow lines and ew ( @xmath93 , @xmath76 ) , while the width of the broad h@xmath3 components anti - correlates with ew . also , we found a baldwin effect in the case of h@xmath3 nlr component , while the ilr component showed no correlation with continuum luminosity , and vblr component shows an inverse baldwin effect for the fwhm @xmath57 3000 @xmath9 subsample .",
    "we confirm in our sample the anti - correlation between ew and ew [ ] which is related to eigenvector 1 ( ev1 ) in @xcite and we examined its dependence on the continuum luminosity and redshift .",
    "we found an inverse baldwin effect for lines from the central and red part of the shelf ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , but for lines from blue part ( @xmath17 ) no correlation was observed .",
    "a baldwin effect was confirmed for the [ ] lines . since ew increases , and ew [ ] decreases with increases of continuum luminosity ( and also the trend of decreasing of ew [ ] /ew ratio with luminosity is obvious ) , the observed ew vs. ew [ ] anti - correlation is probably due to the same physical reason which causes the baldwin effect .",
    "moreover , it is observed that the coefficients of correlation due to baldwin effect depend on h@xmath3 fwhm range of a sub - sample , which also implies the connection between the baldwin effect and ev1 .",
    "a decreasing trend is observed for ew [ ] /ew h@xmath3 vs. continuum luminosity .",
    "we found that the equivalent width of the lines , as well as the ew h@xmath112/ew ratio have a stronger correlation with redshift , than with continuum luminosity .",
    "this implies that the inverse baldwin effect of may be primarily caused by evolution .",

    "using an sql search with requirements mentioned in sec 2.1 , we obtained 497 agn spectra with broad emission lines . from that number",
    ", 188 spectra were rejected because of noise in the iron emission line region .",
    "an example of rejected spectrum is shown in figure [ sum ] .",
    "also , three spectra were rejected because of bad pixels , and one because of very strong double - peak emission in h@xmath3 ( sdss j154213.91@xmath141183500.0 ) .",
    "three more spectra with broad h@xmath3 and practically without the emission were rejected since it was not possible to fit the lines ( sdss j132756.15@xmath141111443.6 , sdss j104326.47@xmath141110524.2 and sdss j083343.47@xmath141074654.5 ) .",
    "these three spectra are shown in figure [ nemafe ] .",
    "there is also a possibility that in these three objects the lines are very broad and weak so that they can not be distinguished from the continuum emission .",
    "the sample contains 302 agn spectra ( table with the sdss identification and obtained parameters from the best fit is available electronically only , as an additional file at http://www.aob.rs/@xmath8jkovacevic/table.txt ) .    to test the host galaxy contribution in the selected sample of 302 agns ,",
    "we have compared our sample with the set of agns which host galaxy fraction is determined in @xcite .",
    "we found 106 common objects . in the case of 48 agns ( 45% of the sample )",
    "there is practically no host galaxy contribution ( 0% ) , and in the rest of the objects , the contribution of the host galaxy is mainly smaller than 20% .",
    "we compared two templates ( one empirical and one theoretical ) with our template .",
    "the empirical template was taken from @xcite using 46 broad and 95 narrow lines identified by @xcite in the i zw 1 spectrum within a @xmath104400 - 5500   range .",
    "the lines were fit with 6 free parameters ( the width , shift and intensity for narrow and the width , shift and intensity for broad lines ) .",
    "we also considered the theoretical model from @xcite calculated for log[@xmath142/(@xmath143)]=11 , [ @xmath29/(1 km s@xmath144)=20 and log[@xmath145/(@xmath146 s@xmath144)]=21 , since we found that this gave the best fit for those values of physical parameters . with this model ,",
    "lines were fit with 3 free parameters ( width , shift and intensity ) .",
    "figure [ 5 ] shows the spectrum of sdss j020039.15 - 084554.9 , an object in which the iron lines have similar relative intensities to i zw 1 .",
    "we fit that spectrum with our template ( a ) , with a template based on line intensities from i zw 1 @xcite ( b ) and with a template calculated by cloudy code @xcite ( c ) .",
    "we found that for this object all three templates fit the iron lines well .    in the case of the sdss j@xmath147 ,",
    "however ( figure [ 6 ] ) , the iron lines in the blue bump are slightly stronger compared to those in the red , and our model fit iron emission slightly better than the other two templates .",
    "the discrepancy between the blue and red bumps is especially emphasized in the spectrum of the object sdss j@xmath58 ( figure [ 7 ] ) , which makes a significant difference for comparison with the properties of i zw 1 object . in this case , our template shows a small disagreement for the lines whose relative intensity is taken from i zw 1 , but other two models , can not fit well this type of the emission .",
    "disagreement is particularly strong in the blue bump ( i.e. , in the multiplets 37 and 38 of the @xmath17 group ) .",
    "to estimate the relative intensities of lines within the three groups , we stated that the intensity of a line ( @xmath148 ) should be proportional to the number of emitters ( @xmath149)@xcite , i.e. for optically thin plasma ( for lines ) one can write : @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the probability of the transition , @xmath152 is the transition wavelength , and @xmath153 is the depth of the emitting region .    of course , the density of emitters can be non - uniform across the region , but we can approximate here that it is uniform , and in the case of non - thermodynamical equilibrium it could be written @xcite : @xmath154 where b(t,@xmath155 ) represents deviation from thermodynamical equilibrium . in the case of lines which have the same lower level , one may approximate the ratio as @xcite :        abazajian , k.n .",

    "<S> their ratios depend on continuum luminosity , fwhm h@xmath3 , the velocity shift of , and the @xmath5/@xmath6 flux ratio . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the dependence of the well - known anti - correlation between the equivalent widths of and [ ] on continuum luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a baldwin effect for [ ] but an inverse baldwin effect for the emission . </S>",
    "<S> the [ ] / ratio thus decreases with l@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> since the ratio is a major component of the boroson and green eigenvector 1 , this implies a connection between the baldwin effect and eigenvector 1 , and could be connected with agn evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that spectra are different for h@xmath3 fwhms greater and less than @xmath83000 @xmath9 , and that there are different correlation coefficients between the parameters . </S>"
