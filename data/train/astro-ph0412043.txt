    "observationally type - i agns are seen to have soft x - ray spectra ( below about 10 kev ) and both narrow and broad emission lines in their optical spectra , in contrast to type - ii agns with harder x - ray spectra and only narrow optical emission lines @xcite .",
    "these observations are naturally explained in the standard unification model of agns @xcite in which both the x - ray emission and the broad emission lines are produced within the region very close to the bh ; the dusty torus blocks this region when viewed nearly edge - on ( type - ii agns ) to the dusty torus . because the dusty torus absorbs the broad optical emission lines almost completely and x - ray photons with lower energies suffer more absorption than higher energy photons , the type - ii agns are observed to have harder x - ray spectra and do not show obvious broad optical emissions lines .",
    "evidence has been accumulated from many different observations in infrared , optical and x - ray bands in support of this unification model for the two types of agns @xcite . despite of these progresses ,",
    "no physically consistent model is currently available to account for the formation and evolution of the dusty torus , which may provide the crucial link between the galactic structure at larger scales and the accretion disk which fuels the smbhs .",
    "recently it has been found that the torus structure may be different for agns with different x - ray luminosity , because the fraction of type - ii agns is anti - correlated with the observed x - ray luminosity , e.g. , found from combined _ asca _ , _ heao1 _ and _ chandra _ surveys @xcite , from combined _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton",
    "_ surveys @xcite , from combined _ asca _ and _ chandra _ surveys @xcite , from _ rxte _ slew survey @xcite , and from a sample of pg agns @xcite .",
    "therefore the above unification scheme may need modifications .",
    "it is proposed that the smaller type - ii fraction for more x - ray luminous agns may imply that the x - ray radiation is blowing out the dusty torus , such that the opening angles for more luminous agns become larger @xcite .",
    "however the dusty torus may also evolve by itself due to the dissipations of collisions among the clouds inside the torus @xcite . despite of these progresses , the formation and evolution of the dusty torus , which may have important consequences for the formation and evolution of smbhs and their host galaxies , are still poorly understood .",
    "however the observed anti - correlation between type - ii agn fractions and x - ray luminosity may be naturally explained within the standard agn unification model if the planes of the accretion disk and the torus are co - aligned and the x - ray emission is produced mainly from the optically thick accretion disk . in this case , type - ii agns are viewed nearly edge - on to both the torus and the accretion disk . because a smaller x - ray flux is observed from an edge - on disk due to the less projected area of the disk ,",
    "type - ii agns appear to be less luminous than type - i agns for the same intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the observed apparent x - ray luminosity is reduced by a factor of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the inclination angle of the accretion disk and @xmath2 degrees for an edge - on disk ; the factor of @xmath3 is due to the area - projection effect and the factor of @xmath4 is due to the limb - darkening effect @xcite respectively ( though our calculations show the simple projection effect alone would produce almost identical results ) .",
    "if agns are assumed being oriented randomly in the sky , then the probability of seeing an agn at an inclination angle @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "therefore for a given intrinsic luminosity of a group of agns , the observed apparent luminosity follows a distribution proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "here we ignore all possible inclination angle dependent relativistic effects which may change both the observed x - ray flux and spectral shape if the emission region is close to the bh @xcite , because the present agn statistics does not require further refinement to this simple model .",
    "consequently the convolution between @xmath8 and a given intrinsic luminosity function produces the observed apparent luminosity function , as shown in figure 1 .    in figure 1",
    ", we apply the above mentioned simple inclination angle effects to the agns sample used by ueda _",
    "( 2003 ) ; all data points are from figure 4 of ueda _ et al . _",
    "a simple broken - power law form of the intrinsic agn luminosity function is first assumed , in order to mimic the overall features of the observed apparent luminosity function .",
    "we then convolve between @xmath8 and this intrinsic luminosity function to produce a trial apparent luminosity function . by adjusting the parameters of the assumed intrinsic luminosity function and",
    "compare each trial apparent luminosity function , the best estimates for these parameters are determined : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is in units of erg / s , @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "it is clear that the observed apparent x - ray luminosity function ( after absorption corrections ) is significantly different from the assumed simple intrinsic luminosity form .",
    "if agns with inclination angles greater than 68 degrees are classified as type - ii agns , we also show the predicted apparent luminosity functions for both type - i and type - ii agns ; clearly these two luminosity functions are also drastically different from each other .    in figure 2 ,",
    "our model predicted type - ii fraction as function of the observed apparent x - ray luminosity is compared to the observed anti - correlation .",
    "the data points are taken from ueda _ et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) ( figure 4 ) and hasinger ( 2003 ) ( figure 6 , left panel ) , as indicated in figure 2 .",
    "the model predicted type - ii agn fraction is calculated as the ratio between the predicted apparent type - ii agn luminosity function and the observed apparent total luminosity function , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "because different samples of type - ii agns may have different dividing inclination angles , we show our model predictions for two different dividing inclination angles of 68 and 76 degrees respectively .",
    "not only our model re - produces the observed overall tendency of the anti - correlation , several features of the observed anti - correlation also agree with the model predictions well ( albeit the limited statistics in the data ) , e.g. , the rapidly declining region for @xmath15 and the two slowly declining segments between @xmath16 and @xmath17 . comparing with the observed type - ii fractions , the dusty torus opening angle",
    "is inferred as around 70 degrees , in agreement with the range of inclination angles determined for some seyfert - i agns @xcite .",
    "the predicted nearly 100% type - ii agns for @xmath18 is the direct consequence of the intrinsic luminosity function cutoff below 10@xmath19 erg / s .",
    "similarly the predicted rapid decreases of type - ii agns for @xmath15 and @xmath20 are due to the intrinsic luminosity function break and cutoff at @xmath21 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "future agn surveys with more statistics for both low and high luminosity ends will test the predictions of our model and thus measure the intrinsic agn luminosity function more accurately .",
    "we first stress the point that because of the inclination angle effects , the observed apparent luminosity of each agn is not the intrinsic luminosity of the agn , unless the inclination angle of each agn is measured directly and the inclination angle effects are corrected to recover the intrinsic luminosity for each agn .",
    "lacking of inclination angle information for most agns , the intrinsic luminosity function of agns is currently not observed directly , because the observed apparent luminosity function is already convolved with the inclination angle effects .",
    "we therefore assumed a simple broken - power law form of the intrinsic luminosity function and determined the parameter values by fitting the convolved luminosity function ( with @xmath8 ) with the observed apparent luminosity function .",
    "the functional form is not motivated astrophysically , but simply chosen to obtain a good fit with the observed apparent luminosity function with a minimum number of free parameters .",
    "the good agreement between this simple form of intrinsic luminosity function suggests that any reasonable agn synthesis model should be able to re - produce agn intrinsic luminosity function similar to that shown in figure 1 .    in this agn unification model",
    ", we explicitly require that the x - ray emission is mainly produced from an optically thick accretion disk coaxed with the torus .",
    "for the typical type - i agn ngc  4151 , its hard x - ray power - law exhibits a characteristic cutoff above around 50 kev , which may be explained as due thermal comptonization of cold disk photons in a hot medium @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling of the hard x - ray spectrum resulted in a comptonization @xmath22-parameter of 0.88@xmath23 and an electron temperature of 73@xmath24@xcite , i.e. , the compton scattering optical depth is 0.93 - 2.9 , supporting our optically thick assumption of the scattering medium .",
    "many observations are also consistent with the disk origin of agn x - ray emission . for example",
    ", the comparison between the variabilities in the x - ray light curves of agns , intermediate mass bh systems and x - ray bh binaries shows that the variability timescales are proportional to their bh masses @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates the same accretion disk origin of x - ray radiation from all these systems , and thus similar physical processes may be going on in astrophysical systems with entirely different scales @xcite .",
    "in particular for the smbh in the center of the milky way , several disk oscillation modes are identified from its x - ray flares @xcite which allowed very precise estimate of the mass and angular momentum of the bh @xcite .",
    "the inverse compton scattering process in the accretion disk may be responsible for the observed x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "alternatively magnetic energy release may be responsible for x - ray emissions from the solar and stellar coronae , and accretion disks in x - ray binaries , intermediate mass and smbhs , because in all these systems x - ray flares are commonly seen @xcite .",
    "a disk - like patchy corona @xcite in agn disk may produce the observed power - law like x - ray emission through magnetic reconnection process @xcite .",
    "socrates , davis & blaes ( 2004 ) have pointed out recently that in the innermost regions of radiation pressure supported accretion disks around black holes in both stellar mass and supermassive black holes , the turbulent magnetic pressure may greatly exceed the gas pressure .",
    "consequently turbulent comptonization may be able to produce x - ray photons in these accretion disks independent of the central black hole mass , providing a viable mechanism for x - ray photon production in agn disks .",
    "the assumption of the disk - torus alignment , as assumed previously @xcite , is also natural .",
    "the formation of an accretion disk requires significant amount of angular momentum for the material transferred to the disk at larger radii .",
    "the only known structure in an agn immediately outside the accretion disk is the dusty torus .",
    "therefore the accretion disk and the torus should be aligned if the torus is the source of the material forming the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the agn unification proposed about two decades ago has survived another critical test .",
    "the success of our simple model , in predicting the observed apparent x - ray luminosity of agns and the type - ii agn fractions , calls for a unification model for agns including a torus , an x - ray emitting accretion disk and a central smbh ; we call this _  taxi \" _ model , which stands for _ t_orus of _ a_ntonucci with _",
    "x_-ray _ i_nclination - angle effects .",
    "the inferred single intrinsic luminosity function for agns , which is significantly different from the observed apparent luminosity function , should be used in the future for all agn population synthesis and related studies . within the framework of this model ,",
    "it is important to investigate further the physics for the formation of the torus and its relationship with the x - ray emitting accretion disk , in order to understand the formation and evolution of smbhs and galaxies @xcite , which are intimately related to the properties of dark matter and the evolutionary history of the universe @xcite .",
