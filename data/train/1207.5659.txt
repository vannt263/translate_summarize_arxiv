    "the comparison and clustering of different time series is an important topic in statistical data analysis and has various applications in fields like economics , marketing , medicine and physics , among many others .",
    "examples are the grouping of stocks in several categories for portfolio selection in finance or the identification of similar birth and death rates in population studies .",
    "one approach to identify similarities or dissimilarities between two stationary processes is to compare the spectral densities of both time series , which directly yields to the testing problem for equality of spectral densities in multivariate time series data .",
    "this problem has found considerable interest in the literature [ see for example @xcite or @xcite for some early results ] , but in the nonparametric situation nearly all proposed procedures are only reasoned by simulation studys or heuristic proofs , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite among many others .",
    "most recently @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite provided mathematical details for the above testing problem using different @xmath1-type statistics , but nevertheless in all mentioned articles it is always required that the different time series have the same length , which is typically not the case in practice . @xcite considered different metrics for the comparison of time series with unequal sample sizes in a simulation study and @xcite provided a theoretical result , which however does not yield a consistent test as it was also pointed out by the authors .",
    "+ this paper generalizes the approach of @xcite to the case of unequal sample sizes and yields a consistent test for the equalness of spectral densities for time series with different length . although the limiting distribution will be the same as in @xcite note that our proof is completely different",
    "this is due to the fact that one essential part in the proofs of @xcite is that the different processes have the same fourier coefficents which is not given if the observed time series have different sample sizes . for the sake of brevity we will focus on the case of two ( not necessarily independent ) stationary processes , but",
    "the results can be easily extended to the case of an @xmath0 dimensional process .",
    "our aim throughout this paper is to estimate the @xmath1-distance @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the spectral densities of the first and the second process respectively . under the null hypothesis @xmath5",
    "the distance @xmath6 equals zero while it is strictly positive if @xmath7 for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a subset of @xmath10 $ ] with positive lebesgue measure .",
    "we will estimate @xmath6 by sums of the ( squared ) periodogram , where the sum goes over the fourier coefficents of the smaller time series .",
    "asymptotic normality both under the null and the alternative will be derived and since the variance terms can be easily estimated also under the alternative , asymptotic confidence intervalls and a precise hypothesis test can be constructed next to the test for [ see remark [ rem1 ] ] .",
    "furthermore our approach has much wider application like testing for zero correlation , discriminant analysis or clustering of time series with unequal length [ see remark [ rem2][remunkor ] ] , and a simulation study will indicate that some of our assumptions are in fact not necessary ( for example our method seems to work also for long memory processes ) .",
    "let @xmath11 with @xmath12 and consider the two stationary time series @xmath13    where the @xmath14 are independent and identically standard normal distributed for @xmath15 and @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "this roughly speaking means that changes in the time series with less observations influence the more frequently observed series but not vice versa , which is for example the case if interest rates and stock returns are compared . throughout the paper",
    "we also assume that the technical condition @xmath19 is satisfied for an @xmath20 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "note that the assumption of gaussianity is only imposed to simplify technical arguments [ see remark [ rem3 ] ] .",
    "furthermore innovations with variances different to @xmath21 can be included by choosing other coefficents @xmath22 .",
    "we define the spectral densities @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) through @xmath25    an unbiased ( but not consistent ) estimator for @xmath26 is given by the periodogram @xmath27    and although the periodogram does not estimate the spectral density consistently , a riemann - sum over the fourier coefficents of an exponentiated periodogram is ( up to a constant ) a consistent estimator for the corresponding integral over the exponentiated spectral density . for example , theorem 2.1 in @xcite yields @xmath28    where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are the fourier coefficents of the smaller time series @xmath31 . if we can show that @xmath32    we can construct an consistent estimator for @xmath6 through @xmath33 .",
    "although looks very much like , note that the convergence in is different since the coefficents @xmath34 are not necessarily the fourier coefficents of the time series @xmath35 .",
    "this implies that the proof of has to be done in a completely different way than the proof of in @xcite .",
    "we now obtain the following main theorem .",
    "[ thm1 ] if @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath36 are hlder continuous of order @xmath37 and @xmath38 for a @xmath39 , then as @xmath40 @xmath41 with @xmath42    although condition imposes some restrictions on the growth rate of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , it is not very restrictive , since in practice there usually occur situations where even @xmath45 holds for a @xmath46 ( if for example daily data are compared with monthly data ) and on the other hand this condition needs only to be satisfied in the limit . from theorem @xmath47 it now follows by a straightforward application of the delta - method that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , which becomes @xmath50 under @xmath51 .",
    "to obtain a consistent estimator for the variance under the null hypothesis we define @xmath52 and analogous to the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] it can be shown that @xmath53    therefore an asymptotic niveau-@xmath54-test for is given by : reject if @xmath55    where @xmath56 denotes the @xmath57 quantile of the standard normal distribution .",
    "this test has asymptotic power @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the distribution function of the standard normal distribution .",
    "this yields that the test has asymptotic power one for all alternatives with @xmath60 .",
    "[ rem1 ]   +    it is straightforward to construct an estimator @xmath61 , which converges to the variance @xmath62 also under the alternative .",
    "this enables us to construct asymptotic @xmath57 confidence intervals for @xmath6 .",
    "the same statement holds , if we consider the normalized measure @xmath63,which can be estimated by @xmath64 .    from theorem [ thm1 ] and a straightforward application of the delta method",
    ", it follows that @xmath65 where @xmath66 can be easily calculated . by considering a consistent estimator @xmath67 for @xmath66 ( which can be constructed through the corresponding riemann sums of the periodogram ) , provides an asymptotic level @xmath54 test for the so called _ precise hypothesis _",
    "@xmath68 where @xmath69 [ see @xcite ] .",
    "this hypothesis is of interest , because spectral densities of time series in real - world applications are usually never exactly equal and a more realistic question is then to ask , if the processes have approximately the same spectral measure .",
    "an asymptotic level @xmath54 test for is obtained by rejecting the null hypothesis , whenever @xmath70 .",
    "[ rem2 ]   + theorem [ thm1 ] can also be employed for a cluster and a discriminant analysis of time series data with different length , since it yields an estimator for the distance measure @xmath71 , where @xmath72 which can take values between 0 and 1 .",
    "a value close to 0 indicates some kind of similarities between two processes , whereas a value close to 1 exhibits dissimilarities in the second - order structure . the distance measure @xmath71 can be estimated by @xmath73 where the maximum is necessary , because the term @xmath74 might be negative .    [ remunkor ]   +",
    "the main ideas of the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] can be furthermore employed to construct tests for various other hypothesis .",
    "for example a test for zero correlation can be derived by testing for @xmath75 which can be done by estimating @xmath76 .",
    "an estimator for this quantity is easily derived using the above approach and furthermore the calculation of the variance is straightforward , which we omit for the sake of brevity .",
    "[ rem3 ]   + although we only considered the bivariate case , our method can be easily extended to an @xmath0 dimensional process .",
    "moreover , a cumbersome but straightforward examination yields that our test also has asymptotic level @xmath54 , if we skip the assumption of gaussianity since ( under the null hypothesis ) all terms which consist the fourth cumulants of the processes @xmath77 cancel out . a similar phenomenon can be observed for the tests proposed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this section we study the size and the power of test in the case of finite samples .",
    "all simulations are based on 1000 iterations and we consider all different combinations of @xmath78 with @xmath79 . for",
    "the sake of brevity we only present the results for the case @xmath80 and note that the rejection frequencies do not change at all if we consider correlations different to zero .",
    "we furthermore tested our approach using non - linear garch models and obtained a very good performance also in this case .",
    "the results are not displayed for the sake of brevity but are available from the authors upon request . to demonstrate the approximation of the nominal level",
    ", we consider the five processes @xmath81}+0.8x_{t-1}1_{[0.5t\\le t\\le 0.75t]}+z_t 1_{[t\\ge0.75 t ] } \\quad \\text{for } t=1, ... ,t,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath82-model corresponds to a longmemory - process given by @xmath83 with the backshift - operator @xmath84 ( i.e. @xmath85 ) .",
    "note that the models @xmath86 and @xmath87 both do not fit into the theoretical framework considered in section 2 , since for the @xmath82-process we obtain @xmath88 which contradicts and the structural - break model @xmath87 does not even has a stationary solution .",
    "nevertheless since these models are of great interest in practice , we investigate the performance of our approach in these cases as well .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab1 ] and it can be seen that the test is very robust against different choices of @xmath43 and @xmath44 . furthermore our method also seems to work for the models @xmath86 and @xmath87 although the convergence is slightly slower .    to study the power of the test we additionally present the results of a comparison of @xmath89 with @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 with @xmath87 ( all other comparison between the processes yield better results than the depicted ones ) .",
    "in this section we investigate how the clustering - method described in remark [ rem2 ] performs , if it is applied to real world data .",
    "therefore we took three log - returns of stock prices from the financial sector , three log - returns from the health sector and two key interest rates .",
    "exemplarily for the finance sector we choosed the stocks of barclays , deutsche bank and goldman sachs and the health sector is represented by glaxosmithkline , novartis and pfizer .",
    "the key interest rates were taken from great britain and the eu and all time series data were recorded between march 1st , 2003 and july 29th , 2011 . while the interest rates data were observed monthly , the stock prices were recorded daily or weekly . however , even if two stock prices were observed daily they might differ in length , since they are for example traded on different stock exchanges with different trading days .",
    "the result of our cluster analysis using is presented in the dendrogram given in figure [ cluster ] .",
    "we get three different groups which correspond to the finance sector , the health sector and the key interes rates .    * acknowledgements * this work has been supported in part by the collaborative research center `` statistical modeling of nonlinear dynamic processes '' ( sfb 823 , teilprojekt c1 , c4 ) of the german research foundation ( dfg ) .",
    "by using the cramer - wold device , we have to show that @xmath93    for all vectors @xmath94 . for the sake of brevity , we restrict ourselve to the case @xmath95 since the more general follows with exactly the same arguments",
    ". therefore we show @xmath96 and we do that by using the method of cumulants , which is described in chapter 2.3 . of @xcite ( and whose",
    "notations we will make heavy use of ) , i.e. in the following it is proved that @xmath97 which will yield the assertion .        which yields that @xmath101 ( without the @xmath102-term ) can be divided into the sums of three terms which are called @xmath9 , @xmath84 and @xmath103 respectively .",
    "for the first term we obtain the conditions @xmath104 ( all others cases are equal to zero ) .",
    "this results in @xmath105      with @xmath107 , where was used .",
    "it now follows by the hlder continuity condition that @xmath9 equals @xmath108 .",
    "if we consider the summand @xmath84 , we obtain the conditions @xmath109 , + @xmath110 which yields @xmath111    if we now employ the identity @xmath112 it follows with that if @xmath113 is chosen there are only finitely many @xmath114 which yields a non - zero summand",
    ". therefore we obtain that @xmath115 and with the same arguments it can be shown that @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117            with @xmath123 @xmath124 ( we only have to consider partitions with two elements in each set , because of the gaussianity of the innovations ; in the non - gaussian case we would get an additional term containing the fourth cumulant ) .",
    "every chosen partition will imply conditions for the choice of @xmath125 as in the calculation of the expectation .",
    "for some partitions there will not be a @xmath125 in the exponent of @xmath126 after inserting the conditions and for other partitions there will still remain one .",
    "let us take an example of the latter one and consider the partition which corresponds to @xmath127 .",
    "we name the corresponding term of this partition in with @xmath128 and obtain the conditions @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 which yields @xmath133    where the last equality again follows with .",

    "these partitions correspond to one of the following three terms : @xmath135      by using .",
    "now the hlder continuity condition implies @xmath139 and since the partitions @xmath140 and @xmath141 yield the same result , we have shown .",

    "we obtain @xmath146      which consists only of sets with two elements ( again this suffices because of the gaussianity of the innovations ) , it follows directly that at most @xmath148 of the @xmath149 variables @xmath150 ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 ) are free to choose . by using the same arguments as in the calculation of the variance and the expectation",
    "it then follows by the indecomposability of the partition that in fact only @xmath153 of the remaining @xmath148 variables @xmath150 are free to choose .",
