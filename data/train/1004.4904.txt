    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are close binary stars containing a black hole or neutron star surrounded by an accretion disk fueled by mass transferred from a low - mass companion .",
    "v1408  aql is an lmxb with an orbital period of @xmath0  h , derived by @xcite from a roughly - sinusoidal modulation he found in its optical light curve .",
    "@xcite attributed the modulation to the varying aspect of the secondary star , which is heated by flux from the primary star and its accretion disk .",
    "@xcite obtained two nights of @xmath1 photometry , covering one orbital period in total , and also saw an orbital variation , but the light curve was more asymmetric than sinusoidal . noting that v1408  aql became bluer when fainter , @xcite interpreted the minimum in the light curve as a grazing eclipse of a cool , red rim on the accretion disk by the secondary star . in their model",
    "the ratio of the rim height to disk radius is large , @xmath2 , and the orbital modulation outside eclipse is caused by variations in the height of the rim , which obscures more or less of the brighter inner disk . because it invokes an eclipse , the model implies a high orbital inclination , the best fitting model having an inclination near @xmath3 .",
    "4u  1957 + 115 , the x - ray counterpart of v1408  aql , is a persistent x - ray source , showing neither large transient increases in brightness nor faint quiescent states .",
    "its x - ray flux does , however , vary on all time scales from 10  hz ( 1 - 2 percent rms amplitude ) to years ( by a factor of four ) @xcite .",
    "the orbital period has not been detected at x - ray wavelengths but @xcite reported a `` marginal detection '' of a periodicity at @xmath4 h , perhaps related to the orbital period ; and @xcite reported a 117-day period in the x - ray light curve , although this period appears to be evanescent @xcite .",
    "the distance to 4u  1957 + 115 is unknown and its mean x - ray luminosity consequently uncertain ; but for a distance of 7  kpc the mean unabsorbed luminosity is @xmath5 ( erg  sec@xmath6 , 1.5 - 12 kev ) , while for a distance of 40 kpc it is @xmath7 @xcite .    the x - ray spectrum of 4u  1957 + 115 has been measured numerous times .",
    "it is unusually soft , placing 4u  1957 + 115 in the region of the x - ray color - color diagram occupied by black hole binaries , including black hole soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) in their outburst states , leading to the suspicion that 4u  1957 + 115 harbors a black hole @xcite .",
    "if it does contain a black hole , it would be the only known black hole binary in the galaxy that has not been seen to cycle between low and outburst states .",
    "the nearly featureless spectrum can be successfully fitted with a variety of models that include some combination of three components : a soft component from a single- or multi - temperature black body , presumably coming from the accretion disk ; a hard component that is either a power law , with or without a cutoff , or a thermal comptonization spectrum ; and a broad emission feature near 6.5  kev from fe k - line emission @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is softer when 4u  1957 + 115 is fainter , harder when it is brighter .",
    "most recently @xcite fit high - quality chandra , xmm - newton , and rxte observations of 4u  1957 + 115 with diskbb @xcite and kerrbb models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the xspec package , fixing the inclination at @xmath3 , and found that these black hole models fit the observed x - ray spectrum well .",
    "the fits required high inner - disk temperatures , @xmath8 , and a low normalization factor , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the inner radius of the disk in km , @xmath11 is the distance in units of 10 kpc , and @xmath12 is the orbital inclination .",
    "there are degeneracies among the derived values for the mass of the compact object , the mass accretion rate , and the distance , but the best fitting models ranged from a @xmath13 black hole with a spin of @xmath14 at a distance of 10  kpc to a @xmath15 black hole with @xmath16 at a distance of 22  kpc .",
    "nevertheless , the question remains : is the compact object in 4u  1957 + 115 really a black hole ?",
    "the evidence for a black hole is hardly conclusive .",
    "a soft spectrum does not necessarily require a black hole ",
    "many sxts contain neutron stars @xcite , and @xcite did not explore models for disks around neutron stars .",
    "furthermore , @xcite argued that the high values of @xmath17 and low values of @xmath18 deduced from fits to the x - ray spectral energy distribution are more typical of neutron star systems than black hole systems .",
    "in this paper we present new optical photometry of v1408  aql .",
    "we refine the orbital period and derive the mean orbital light curve .",
    "there are no eclipses in the light curve .",
    "we achieve good fits to the orbital light curve with a model similar to that proposed by @xcite in which the orbital modulation is due to the varying aspect of the irradiated face of the secondary star .",
    "we believe this model is more physically realistic than models that invoke a tall disk rim to produce the orbital modulation , but it increases the range of possible orbital inclinations and mass ratios .",
    "we observed v1408  aql from 2008 june 2 to june 7 utc and again from august 2 to august 7 with the argos prime - focus high - speed ccd photometer on the 2.1-m otto struve telescope at mcdonald observatory @xcite .",
    "we did not obtain data on june 6 nor on august 3 and 4 because of clouds .",
    "the observations were made through a filter equivalent to a combined @xmath19 filter transmitting the wavelength range 41307385   and with an exposure time of 10 seconds for all frames .",
    "the data were reduced using a combination of iraf routines and an idl pipeline ( r. hynes , private communication ) .",
    "data reduction for the argos photometer is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we measured relative fluxes by dividing the flux from v1408  aql by the total flux from two nearby comparison stars in the frame .",
    "figure [ fc ] shows a stacked image of three @xmath19 images of the field of v1408  aql for a 30-second effective exposure .",
    "v1408  aql is indicated with vertical hash marks and the two comparison stars are circled .",
    "these are the comparison stars numbered 6 and 8 in @xcite .",
    "to search for orbital variations we folded the light curve on a linear ephemeris with a period of 9.331  h ( see below ) .",
    "figure [ lc ] shows the phase - folded data from each night binned into 350 equal - width phase bins .",
    "the error bars shown in the figure are based on photon counting noise and do not include other noise sources , such as accretion disk flickering .",
    "observations with errors greater than @xmath20 in relative flux ( @xmath212.5% ) due to poor seeing or clouds have been discarded .",
    "the light curve has a pronounced , roughly sinusoidal orbital modulation .",
    "there are also flickering variations with an amplitude of @xmath22 of the median flux over an interval of @xmath23 in phase or @xmath24 hours .",
    "there are no obvious eclipses .    the mean flux from v1408  aql changes on time scales of days to months .",
    "the system was fainter in june , brighter during the first two nights in august , and fading on august 6 and 7 .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ lc ] shows the fainter light curve , the middle panel shows the brighter light curve , and the bottom panel shows the transition light curves .",
    "the color and symbol combinations indicate the different nights of observations . the dashed line is a sine curve fitted to the june data ( top panel ) and plotted in the middle and bottom panels for comparison .",
    "the brighter state has @xmath25% more flux than the fainter state but the peak - to - valley amplitude of the sinusoidal variations is nearly the same fraction of the median flux in both states .",
    "the orbital light curve of v1408  aql in 2008 was nearly identical to the light curve measured by @xcite in 1985 . in both years the variations of the mean light curve were nearly sinusoidal with , as we will show in section  5.2 , peak - to - peak amplitudes near 23% . while it is possible that the mean orbital light curve was truly different in 1996 when observed by @xcite , they constructed the 1996 light curve from data that were obtained on just two nights and covered slightly less than one full orbit with no phase overlap .",
    "it is more likely that the light curve was distorted by flickering and night - to - night variations of the mean flux , and is not a good representation of the mean orbital light curve .",
    "since the variations of color with orbital phase are also affected by these problems , it is premature to conclude that v1408  aql becomes bluer at fainter orbital phases . on the other hand ,",
    "figures  2 and 3 in @xcite do show that any color changes are small and , in the bvr passbands , consistent with zero .",
    "@xcite did not detect the orbital modulation at all in photometry of v1408  aql obtained between 2006 and 2009 , and concluded that the system had changed .",
    "their sparse data set ( eg , 35 data points in @xmath26 spread over 3.1 years ) is not , however , well suited for detecting an orbital modulation that has been diluted by flickering and night - to - night variations .",
    "also , their densest data set , from 2008 , by chance covers only half the orbit with consequent loss of sensitivity to orbital modulations .",
    "our data , taken within a few weeks of theirs in 2008 , shows that the orbital modulation was clearly present .",
    "the @xcite data does show that the night - to - night variations can have a total range of at least 0.8  mag , somewhat higher than the 0.6  mag we observed .    to refine the orbital period we first separately calculated the medians of the fainter state and brighter state light curves and then subtracted the medians to place the faint and bright light curves at zero median flux .",
    "we then performed a lomb - scargle ( l - s ) period search , excluding the transition light curves @xcite .",
    "the l - s periodogram in figure  [ lomb ] shows a series of peaks near the orbital period found by @xcite , with the two highest peaks at @xmath27  h and @xmath28  h. all these peaks have vanishingly small false alarm probabilities ( @xmath29 ) , reflecting the large amplitude of the orbital variation , and all are two - month aliases of each other introduced by the two - month separation of our observing runs .",
    "because thorstensen s data were taken over a single 12-day interval and are not subject to one- or two - month aliases , we have used his period to choose among the aliases in our data .",
    "his period , @xmath30 h , agrees with the @xmath27  h peak in our l - s periodogram to within a standard deviation and differs from the other peaks in figure  [ lomb ] by six or more standard deviations .",
    "the orbital ephemeris is , then , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the time of maximum flux .",
    "we searched for , but did not find , any periodic modulations at other frequencies in the optical data , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "figure [ xte ] shows the one - day - averaged x - ray light curve of 4u  1957 + 115 from the rxte all sky monitor ( asm ) during 2008 may to august .",
    "the times of our optical observations are also shown in the figure .",
    "the x - ray flux was fairly constant in june when v1408  aql was faint at optical wavelengths .",
    "the x - ray flux was generally higher in late july and august , but on those dates in august when we observed v1408  aql , the x - ray flux was not any higher than it was in june .",
    "we searched for periodicities in the x - ray light curve from 1996 january to 2008 october in dwell - by - dwell samples using both a least - squares sine curve periodogram and a l - s periodogram .",
    "the l - s periodograms in figures [ xls1 ] and [ xsine ] are fully - generalized l - s periodograms @xcite .",
    "this method is an improvement over the original l - s periodogram because it includes the weights of individual data points and allows for non - zero means .",
    "the periodograms have been normalized assuming the noise is white .",
    "figures [ xls1 ] and [ xsine ] also show least squares sine fit periodograms for comparison .",
    "figure [ xls1 ] shows the periodograms of the x - ray light curve at periods near the orbital period .",
    "the open circle with error bars marks a frequency of 2.5726 day@xmath6 , corresponding to the orbital period from @xcite ; and the dashed line marks a frequency of 2.5722 day@xmath6 , corresponding to the 9.331-hour orbital period from our data .",
    "the horizontal dashed line is drawn at the l - s power level for which the false alarm probability is 99% .",
    "the dot at 2.5758 day@xmath6 marks the `` marginal detection '' at @xmath33 hours from @xcite .",
    "there are no significant peaks in the periodogram at this or any other frequency between 2.54 and 2.6 day@xmath6 .",
    "thus , there is no evidence for any modulation of the x - ray flux at periods near the orbital period .",
    "figure [ xsine ] shows the low frequency periodograms .",
    "the extra power at frequencies less than @xmath34  d@xmath6 is real in the sense that the probability it could be produced by white noise is @xmath35 .",
    "none of the individual low - frequency peaks correspond to any of the long periods mentioned by @xcite and @xcite , including those at 58.5  d , 117  d , and 234  d. we therefore attribute this excess power to non - periodic or perhaps transient periodic variations of the x - ray flux .",
    "we modeled the orbital light curve of v1408  aql using our light curve synthesis program for x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "the program assumes that the orbital eccentricity is zero , the primary star is a point source surrounded by an accretion disk , and the secondary star fills its roche lobe .",
    "the accretion disk can have a complicated geometry .",
    "it can be non - circular , non - axisymmetric , and spotted , and can have structures that extend vertically out of the plane of the disk , such as an interior torus and a tall disk rim .",
    "the program uses stellar atmospheres from @xcite for the spectrum of the secondary star and blackbody spectra for all other structures .",
    "it allows for heating by irradiation but not for second - order heating by the irradiated surfaces .",
    "light curves can be calculated for johnson / cousins filters or for a square bandpass over a specified wavelength range .",
    "because we observed with a broadband @xmath19 filter , we used the square bandpass option with wavelength range 41307385   .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 4u  1957 + 115 is remarkably simple .",
    "@xcite suggest that it `` ... may be the cleanest disk spectrum with which to study modern disk models . ''",
    "as noted in the introduction , the continuum can be modeled with just a multi - temperature black body disk , perhaps with a weak optically - thin comptonizing corona . with the possible exception of the fe k - line",
    ", there are no strong emission lines .",
    "the spectrum does have absorption lines , but @xcite attribute the lines to absorption in hot - phase interstellar material in the line of sight to 4u  1957 + 115 .",
    "the x - ray light curve shows no periodicities that might be attributable to disk warping , super - humps , precession , or other disk asymmetries .",
    "thus , neither the x - ray spectrum nor the x - ray light curve require models with complex disk structures .",
    "we are also loathe to invoke a tall variable - height rim at the outer edge of the disk to modulate the optical orbital light curve . as we have noted previously @xcite , tall rims",
    "are highly unphysical , requiring either supersonic turbulence or temperatures much higher than expected near the edge of the disk .",
    "we have , therefore , adopted a thin , axisymmetric disk in our model .",
    "since there are no eclipses , the only effect of the disk is to add constant flux to the light curve and to irradiate the secondary star ; and the only source of orbital modulation is the varying aspect of the irradiated secondary star .",
    "this simple model has just five meaningful parameters : the mass ratio , the orbital inclination , the zero point in orbital phase , the x - ray flux from the central source , which heats the secondary star , and an additional constant optical flux from the disk , which also heats the secondary star .",
    "a preliminary analysis showed that the model yields synthetic light curves that fit the observed orbital light curves equally well for a wide range of parameters .",
    "we therefore abandoned any attempt to define `` best '' values for the mass ratio and orbital inclination and , instead , explored the range of parameters that yield acceptable fits .",
    "we considered three mass ratios , @xmath36 , 0.1 , and 0.025 , roughly corresponding to a compact object that is a neutron star , a low mass black hole , and a high mass black hole . for each mass ratio",
    "we fit synthetic light curves for models with inclinations of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , plus some for models at @xmath42 , @xmath3 , and @xmath43 . for concreteness , we set the mass of the secondary star to @xmath44 and its temperature to 3500  k. our results are nearly independent of @xmath45 since the geometry of the system depends only on @xmath46 and the scale of the system depends only on @xmath47 .",
    "the secondary s low temperature prevents its un - irradiated surfaces from adding significant flux to the light curve .",
    "we quantified the quality of the fits with @xmath48 and used the simplex algorithm @xcite in idl to find the values of the remaining three parameters ( zero phase , x - ray flux , optical flux ) that minimized @xmath48 .",
    "because of the flickering , light curves from individual nights often depart from the mean orbital light curve by much more than the standard deviation of the measurements , which greatly increases @xmath48 .",
    "since the flickering in effect adds non - white noise to the data and the light curves are sampled with a high cadence , the departures are strongly correlated , thwarting our attempts to artificially increase the variances of the individual data points to account for the flickering . as a result , the absolute value of @xmath48 loses its meaning .",
    "nevertheless , the relative value of @xmath48 retains its utility for measuring the relative quality of fits .",
    "figures [ nslc ] and [ hmlc ] show the observed light curves overlayed by fitted synthetic light curves .",
    "the figures show fits to the light curves during both the fainter and brighter states , for two inclinations near the limits of the range we explored , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and for the largest and smallest mass ratios we explored , @xmath51 ( figure [ nslc ] ) and @xmath52 ( figure [ hmlc ] ) .",
    "the peak - to - peak amplitude of the fitted synthetic light curve is 23% of the mean flux when v1408  aql is in its fainter state and 24% of the mean flux when it is in its brighter state . for comparison , @xcite measured an amplitude of 0.116  mag or a peak - to - peak amplitude of 22.6% .",
    "the independence of the fractional amplitude from the mean flux is an important constraint .",
    "we interpret the constraint to mean that ( 1 ) the optical flux from both the disk and the secondary star is dominated by reprocessed x - ray flux and ( 2 ) the flux - weighted temperatures of the irradiated surfaces are high enough that the emitted optical flux is on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the blackbody distribution .",
    "changes in the x - ray flux then produce proportional changes in the optical flux from the disk and from the heated face of the secondary star , leaving their relative contributions to the optical flux unchanged .",
    "the blue colors of v1408  aql ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 @xcite ) are at least roughly consistent with this interpretation .",
    "we achieved equally good fits to the orbital light curves for all three mass ratios .",
    "the dominant effect of increasing the mass ratio is to increase the relative size of the secondary star ; but the effect of the increased size can be offset by reducing the amount of irradiative heating . as a result ,",
    "the observed light curves do not by themselves yield useful limits on the mass ratio .",
    "we have two ways to place an upper limit on the orbital inclination .",
    "the first is from the lack of eclipses in the light curve .",
    "let us assume that the accretion disk extends to its tidal truncation radius , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the roche lobe around the compact object .",
    "eclipses of the disk would be detected in the mean light curve if they were more than about 2% deep .",
    "this occurs at @xmath58 for @xmath59 , at @xmath60 for @xmath61 , and at @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "the limiting inclinations are higher if @xmath64 .",
    "the second way to place an upper limit on the inclination is from a flattening of the minimum of the synthetic light curves at high orbital inclinations .",
    "figure  [ 70ls ] shows synthetic light curves for @xmath51 ( top , red line ) , @xmath65 ( middle , green line ) , and @xmath52 ( bottom , blue line ) , each for an inclination of @xmath41 .",
    "the synthetic light curves all flatten at minimum light .",
    "this flattening is unrelated to eclipses but instead occurs because less than half the secondary star is irradiated , because the edges of the irradiated region are heated to lower temperatures , and because the secondary is not spherical .",
    "the lack of flat minima in the observed optical light curves places an upper limit of @xmath41 on the orbital inclination .",
    "this second limit is independent of mass ratio and the size of the accretion disk , and is more reliable than the limits set by the lack of disk eclipses .",
    "the synthetic light curves for models with orbital inclinations of @xmath38 and @xmath40 both fit the observed light curves well .",
    "the fit for @xmath38 has a slightly smaller @xmath48 but the difference is not statistically significant .",
    "the dominant effect of decreasing the orbital inclination is to decrease the amplitude of the orbital modulation caused by the changing aspect of the secondary star , but the decrease of the relative amplitude can be offset by decreasing the fraction of the flux contributed by the accretion disk .",
    "this is shown in table  1 , which gives the fraction of the optical flux , @xmath66 , that comes from the accretion disk as a function of orbital inclination ; the fraction is also shown as the dashed lines in figures [ nslc ] and [ hmlc ] .",
    "the value of @xmath66 is nearly independent of the mass ratio and the luminosity state , but decreases with orbital inclination , dropping slowly from @xmath67 at @xmath68 to @xmath69 at @xmath70 , and then dropping rapidly to zero at @xmath71 .",
    "the flickering in the light curve disfavors inclinations less than @xmath38 .",
    "the low values of @xmath66 at @xmath72 would require an improbably high fraction of the disk flux to be modulated to produce the observed amplitude of the flickering .",
    "the results from the previous section show that neither the mass ratio nor the orbital inclination are strongly constrained by the shape of the light curve .",
    "they are , however , constrained by color and temperature , albeit rather weakly and with some uncertainty .",
    "we take as our starting point that the optical flux from v1408  aql is dominated by regions of the secondary star and disk that are on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the black body distribution .",
    "let @xmath75 and @xmath76 be the flux weighted temperatures of the irradiated areas of the secondary star and disk so that @xmath77 is the ratio of their emitted optical fluxes .",
    "we have two ways to calculate @xmath77 .",
    "the first is from the amplitude of the orbital modulation , which is nearly independent of the luminosity and linear scale of the model ; and the second is from the irradiative heating of the disk and secondary star , which depends strongly on the luminosity and scale of the model .",
    "the two calculations must agree for the model to be internally consistent .    from the amplitude of the orbital modulation , the ratio of the optical energy coming from the secondary to the optical energy from the disk is @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the areas of the secondary star and disk that contribute significantly to the optical flux , the factor of 2 because only half the secondary is irradiated and the factor of @xmath81 because the disk is foreshortened .",
    "if the disk has expanded to its tidal truncation radius , then @xmath56 , and equation  [ fluxratio - eq ] can be rewritten as @xmath82 , \\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the semi - major axis , and @xmath84 and @xmath85 are functions of @xmath46 and can be calculated from , for example , eggleton s approximation @xcite .",
    "table  1 gives the values of @xmath77 implied by the fits to the light curves .",
    "note that @xmath77 must be larger for smaller mass ratios because the relative size of the secondary star is smaller .",
    "the temperature of the irradiated secondary depends primarily on @xmath46 , the scale of the system ( set by @xmath45 ) , the x - ray luminosity , and the fraction of the incident radiation that is locally thermalized and re - emitted .",
    "table  2 gives typical values for @xmath75 for x - ray luminosities of @xmath86 and @xmath87  erg s@xmath6 for each of the three mass ratios , where we have assumed that the x - ray energy is produced near the compact object and that all the x - ray energy incident on the secondary star is thermalized and re - emitted .",
    "the temperature of an irradiated disk is extremely sensitive to disk geometry and the location of the source of the irradiating x - rays ( see , eg , @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", our models give no reliable constraint on @xmath76 .",
    "we will simply take that @xmath76 must be greater than @xmath88  k for its optical flux to be on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the blackbody distribution .",
    "it is possible , of course , that @xmath76 is substantially greater than @xmath89  k.    we can now calculate @xmath77 the second way , using @xmath75 from table  2 and taking @xmath90  k so that the resulting @xmath77 is an upper limit . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the upper limits are @xmath91 for @xmath92  erg  s@xmath6 and @xmath93 for @xmath86  erg  s@xmath6 these values are consistent with the values in table  1 for any @xmath94 and yield no additional useful constraint on the inclination . for @xmath61 the upper limits are 4.0 and 2.2 and are mildly constrained , needing @xmath95 for @xmath87  erg s@xmath6 and @xmath96 for @xmath86  erg s@xmath6 . at @xmath63",
    "the upper limits are 3.1 and 1.7 and become more strongly constraining . only the model with @xmath92",
    "erg s@xmath6 is internally consistent and even it requires @xmath97 .",
    "these constraints are not , however , as certain as one might wish .",
    "the values of @xmath77 given in table  1 are directly proportional to the adopted area of the accretion disk .",
    "if the radius of the accretion disk is as small as the circularization radius , @xmath77 is reduced by a factor of 4 or more , and the inclination becomes essentially unconstrained even for @xmath63 . on the other hand , if @xmath76 is greater than @xmath89  k , the constraints on the orbital inclination become more severe .",
    "thus the most that can be concluded is that higher mass ratios are mildly favored and the models are internally consistent over a wide range of inclinations and mass ratios .    finally , it is possible that further observations may show that v1408  aql does , indeed , becomes bluer at fainter orbital phases as claimed by @xcite .",
    "our model can reproduce such color variations  all that is required is that the heated face of the secondary star have a temperature less than the temperature of the accretion disk .",
    "this would strongly constrain the permitted mass ratios and inclinations , eliminating the @xmath63 models altogether and restricting the @xmath61 models to inclinations greater than @xmath98 and the @xmath59 models to inclinations greater than @xmath99 .",
    "we obtained high - speed photometry of v1408  aql on nine nights in june and august of 2008 . the optical light curve flickered by at least 5% on time scales of minutes to hours and the orbit - averaged flux varied by 30% on time scales of a few days .",
    "the mean orbital light curve was roughly sinusoidal with a peak - to - peak amplitude near 23% and was not measurably different from the light curve observed by @xcite in 1985 .",
    "we attribute the lack of an orbital modulation reported by @xcite and the different shape of the orbital light curve found by @xcite to the sparseness of their data sets and to the distortions of the light curve induced by flickering and night - to - night variations .",
    "the refined orbital period is @xmath100  d ( equation  [ ephem ] ) .",
    "there are no significant periodicities in the rxte asm x - ray light curve at or near the orbital period .",
    "the orbital light curve is consistent with a model in which the accretion disk around the compact star is thin , axisymmetric , and uneclipsed .",
    "the secondary star is irradiated and heated by x - rays from the compact star and the accretion disk .",
    "the orbital modulation is caused entirely by the varying aspect of the heated face of the secondary star with orbital phase .",
    "this simple model yields consistent fits for all mean light levels and it avoids an unphysically tall disk rim .    at inclinations greater than @xmath41",
    "the synthetic orbital light curves flatten at minimum light .",
    "the lack of a flat minimum in the observed light curve places an upper limit of @xmath101 on the orbital inclination .",
    "we can not place an unimpeachable lower limit on the orbital inclination but argue that both the amplitude of the flickering and the lack of color variations over the orbit imply that the orbital inclination is greater than @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the orbital inclination lies between @xmath38 and @xmath41 .",
    "we achieved good fits to the light curves with mass ratios from 0.025 to 0.3 .",
    "if the radius of the accretion disk is close to the tidal truncation radius , the smaller mass ratios , which correspond to systems in which the primary is a black hole , require x - ray luminosities nearer @xmath87  erg  s@xmath6 and orbital inclinations in the upper half of the permitted range .",
    "figure 8 in @xcite plots optical luminosity against x - ray luminosity for v1408  aql and other lmxbs .",
    "the distance to v1408  aql is unknown , but @xcite adopt three distances for comparison .",
    "if the distance is 7  kpc , the x - ray luminosity is @xmath102  erg  s@xmath6 , and at at 20  kpc , it is @xmath103  erg  s@xmath6 , placing v1408  aql in a regions of the figure occupied by neutron star binaries but not black hole binaries . at 40  kpc ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity is @xmath104  erg  s@xmath6 and v1408  aql falls in a region occupied by some soft - state black hole binaries and the neutron star z - sources .",
    "all these possibilities remain viable with our new model .",
    "if , however , v1408  aql contains a black hole it would be unusual in two ways .",
    "first , as mentioned earlier it would be the only known black hole binary in the galaxy that has not been seen to cycle between low and outburst states .",
    "second , irradiative heating is more typical of neutron star x - ray binaries than black hole binaries .",
    "this is shown most clearly by sxts during their outbursts .",
    "large amplitude modulations from irradiative heating have been observed during outbursts of aql  x-1 and xte  2123 - 058 and possibly x1608 - 52 , all of which are classical sxts containing neutron stars ; and have also been observed in the related neutron star x - ray transient xte  j2129 + 47 @xcite . in contrast , orbital modulation from irradiative heating of the secondary star is rarely observed in black hole sxts and , if it is observed , its amplitude is low @xcite .",
    "this is due at least partly to the lower mass ratios of black hole binaries . at lower mass ratios",
    "the secondary star is comparatively smaller .",
    "as shown in section 5.3 , the smaller secondary can produce a large - amplitude orbital modulation only if its irradiated face is heated to high temperatures .",
    "finally , the light curves of the black hole sxts often show superhumps @xcite .",
    "such superhumps are ubiquitous in mass transfer binaries with disks whose radii cross the 3:1 orbital resonance , which requires a mass ratio less than @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "the failure of v1408  aql to show superhumps in its light curve argues that its mass ratio is larger than @xmath105 and the mass of its primary star is less than @xmath106 .",
    "all the known black holes in binary stars have masses greater than about @xmath107 @xcite . while none of these arguments are conclusive , together they weigh heavily in favor of a neutron star and against a black hole in v1408  aql .                          , t. , imada , a. , uemura , m. , nogami , d. , maehara , h. , ishioka , r. , baba , h. , matsumoto , k. , iwamatsu , h. , kubota , k. , sugiyasu , k. , soejima , y. , moritani , y. , ohshima , t. , ohashi , h. , tanaka , j. , sasada , m. , arai , a. , nakajima , k. , kiyota , s. , tanabe , k. , imamura , k. , kunitomi , n. , kunihiro , k. , taguchi , h. , koizumi , m. , yamada , n. , nishi , y. , kida , m. , tanaka , s. , ueoka , r. , yasui , h. , maruoka , k. , henden , a. , oksanen , a. , moilanen , m. , tikkanen , p. , aho , m. , monard , b. , itoh , h. , dubovsky , p.  a. , kudzej , i. , dancikova , r. , vanmunster , t. , pietz , j. , bolt , g. , boyd , d. , nelson , p. , krajci , t. , cook , l.  m. , torii , k. , starkey , d.  r. , shears , j. , jensen , l. , masi , g. , hynek , t. , nov , k , r. , koci , n , r. , kr , l , l. , ku , kov , h. , kolasa , m. , tastn , p. , staels , b. , miller , i. , sano , y. , de ponthire , p. , miyashita , a. , crawford , t. , brady , s. , santallo , r. , richards , t. , martin , b. , buczynski , d. , richmond , m. , kern , j. , davis , s. , crabtree , d. , beaulieu , k. , davis , t. , aggleton , m. , morelle , e. , pavlenko , e.  p. , andreev , m. , baklanov , a. , koppelman , m.  d. , billings , g. , urbancok , l. , gmen , y. , heathcote , b. , gomez , t.  l. , voloshina , i. , retter , a. , mularczyk , k. , zoczewski , k. , olech , a. , kedzierski , p. , pickard , r.  d. , stockdale , c. , virtanen , j. , morikawa , k. , hambsch , f. , garradd , g. , gualdoni , c. , geary , k. , omodaka , t. , sakai , n. , michel , r. , crdenas , a.  a. , gazeas , k.  d. , niarchos , p.  g. , yushchenko , a.  v. , mallia , f. , fiaschi , m. , good , g.  a. , walker , s. , james , n. , douzu , k. , julian , ii , w.  m. , butterworth , n.  d. , shugarov , s.  y. , volkov , i. , chochol , d. , katysheva , n. , rosenbush , a.  e. , khramtsova , m. , kehusmaa , p. , reszelski , m. , bedient , j. , liller , w. , pojmanski , g. , simonsen , m. , stubbings , r. , schmeer , p. , muyllaert , e. , kinnunen , t. , poyner , g. , ripero , j. , & kriebel , w. 2009 , , 61 , 395                                                            , c. , torres , m.  a.  p. , steeghs , d. , rodrguez - gil , p. , muoz - darias , t. , casares , j. , shahbaz , t. , martnez - pais , i.  g. , zhao , p. , garcia , m.  r. , piccioni , a. , bartolini , c. , guarnieri , a. , bloom , j.  s. , blake , c.  h. , falco , e.  e. , szentgyorgyi , a. , & skrutskie , m. 2006 , , 644 , 432      ccccccc + [ -9pt ] & & & + [ 3pt ] + [ -9pt ] inclination & faint state & bright state & & @xmath51 & @xmath61 & @xmath63 + [ 6pt ] + [ -9pt ] @xmath108 & 0.337 & 0.334 & & 9.49 & 24.9 & 78.0 + @xmath109 & 0.683 & 0.666 & & 2.28 & 5.97 & 18.7 + @xmath110 & 0.784 & 0.759 & & 1.33 & 3.48 & 10.9 + @xmath111 & 0.830 & 0.808 & & 0.88 & 2.31 & 7.23 + @xmath112 & 0.857 & 0.839 & & 0.60 & 1.56 & 4.90",
