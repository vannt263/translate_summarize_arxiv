    "<S> nowadays , random telegraph signals play an important role in integrated circuit performance variability , leading for instance to failures in memory circuits . this problem is related to the successive captures and emissions of electrons at the many traps stochastically distributed at the silicon - oxide ( s@xmath0-s@xmath0o@xmath1 ) interface of mos transistors . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a novel analytical and numerical approach to statistically describe the fluctuations of current due to random telegraph signal in time domain . </S>",
    "<S> our results include two distinct situations : when the density of interface trap density is uniform in energy , and when it is an u - shape curve as prescribed in literature , here described as simple quadratic function . </S>",
    "<S> we establish formulas for relative error as function of the parameters related to capture and emission probabilities . for a complete analysis experimental u - shape curves </S>",
    "<S> are used and compared with the theoretical aproach .    </S>",
    "<S> low frequency ( lf ) noise is a performance limiting factor for deep sub - micron cmos devices @xcite . in these devices , </S>",
    "<S> lf noise is dominated by multiple random telegraph signals ( rts ) ( see @xcite for a discussion on rts in s@xmath0-s@xmath0o@xmath1 interfaces ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mos transistor employed in analog and digital designs drives a current @xmath2 which is a function of the potential differences @xmath3 and @xmath4 applied respectively between drain and source and gate and source@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rts noise is due to succeeding electron capture and emission by a number of @xmath5traps distributed according to a poisson distribution at the s@xmath6-s@xmath6o@xmath7 interface , as it can be observed in plot [ mechanism_lf - noise ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomena causes oscillations in the transistor current @xmath2 over time , even with @xmath8 and @xmath4 constant . </S>",
    "<S> a typical variation in the current caused by one single trap is shown in figure [ mechanism_lf - noise ] ( b ) .        </S>",
    "<S> noise performance may strongly vary between different devices on a same chip , and even between different operation points of a single transistor . </S>",
    "<S> recent results @xcite claim these effects responsible for fails in flash memories . for future technologies , rts may become relevant also for the performance of combinational digital gates , as inverters and other logic gates . </S>",
    "<S> the propagation delay of a gate depends on the capability of its transistors to drive current . </S>",
    "<S> a smaller current driven by the transistor means larger propagation delay , which may lead to timing violations ( failures ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the variation in transistor drive current due to rts may lead to circuit failures in future technology generations , and statistical modeling of random telegraph signal is demanded . </S>",
    "<S> but until now statistical models for rts focused on frequency domain , for instance refer to dasilva_2008_appropriate for a statistical rts model in frequency domain . </S>",
    "<S> this is suitable for analog circuits , whose design and analysis is performed in frequency domain . however , for digital circuits an appropriate time domain statistical analysis is needed , since these circuits are analyzed and designed using time domain metrics . </S>",
    "<S> so , as rts is becoming a major issue on upcoming digital integrated circuits , an approppriate rts noise model for time domain is mandatory for the correct modeling of the behavior of fugure digital circuits .    aiming to address this issue </S>",
    "<S> , this work presents for the first time in literature a comprehensive model for rts in time domain . </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytical expressions for the average and relative error of the transistor current . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the joint contribution of all the traps to the transistor current , instead of analyzing only the current fluctuation due to one single trap , which is more suitable for analyzing the total current fluctuation of the transistor . </S>",
    "<S> our model considers the density of states in the band - gap analyzing three possible situations :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the density of states is uniform in the band - gap range . </S>",
    "<S> this is based on previous results from literature ( see for example @xcite ) 2 .   the density of states curve measured from experimental data , which was published in @xcite and shows that the density of states follows an u - shape curve . </S>",
    "<S> we performed a polynomial fit with a 8-degree polynomial which fits very well with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   the density of states modeled as a quadratic function in the band - gap range . </S>",
    "<S> this is an approximation for the experimental data of @xcite , which is an u - shape curve .    in the random telegraph signals </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath9 denotes the state of the i - th trap ( @xmath10empty or @xmath11occupied ) , the fermi - dirac statistics governs the probability of transition : @xmath12 } = \\frac{dt}{\\tau _ { c}^{(i ) } } \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\pr ( \\sigma _ { i } & = & 1\\rightarrow \\sigma _ { i}=0)dt=\\frac{dt}{10^{p_{i}}\\left [ 1+\\exp ( q_{i})\\right ] } = \\frac{dt}{\\tau _ { e}^{(i)}}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the average time of capture and emission and @xmath15 where @xmath16is the energy ( within the band - gap ) of the @xmath17th trap , @xmath18 is the fermi - level energy , @xmath19 the boltzmann constant and @xmath20 is temperature . in a first model @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> is considered a uniform random variable and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are identically distributed , i.e. , @xmath22 and @xmath23for @xmath24 .    here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath25 is also a random uniform variable within an interval @xmath26 and in this case in the frequency domain , we can establish an important connection . </S>",
    "<S> it is not difficult to show ( see for example @xcite ) that the power spectrum density correponding to the noise from the @xmath27-th trap is a lorentzian function @xmath28 ^{-1}$ ] where @xmath29 @xmath30is the corner frequency corresponding to the trap and @xmath31 is its amplitude . from </S>",
    "<S> that we conclude @xmath32 and due to this @xmath29 is uniformly distributed in a @xmath33 scale resulting in a probability distribution @xmath34 ^{-1}$ ] for the corner frequencies ( this assumption will be used from now on in this paper ) .    from this approach </S>",
    "<S> , we can calculate @xmath35and thus the average current due to a single trap is computed by    @xmath36    the amplitudes @xmath37 are also random variables and our results will be dependent on its first and second moments , respectively @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the next step is to consider the contribution of all traps , because by doing so one can compute the fluctuation of the current passing through the channel of the mos transistor . </S>",
    "<S> the average current , taking in consideration all random sources , is written as:@xmath40 @xmath41 \\\\ &   &   \\\\ & = & \\frac{n\\ \\left\\langle \\delta \\right\\rangle } { 2q}\\ \\left [ 2q+\\ln e^{-q}% \\right ] = \\frac{n\\ \\left\\langle \\delta \\right\\rangle } { 2}% \\end{array}%\\]]where @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the device dimensions and @xmath46 is the density of traps by area unit and by decade frequency in log - scale . </S>",
    "<S> so , we can conclude that @xmath47 is constant , i.e. , it does not depend on @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion motivates the investigation for superior moments of @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly we can compute the second moment:@xmath50where @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> so , this amount can be calculated : @xmath52    because @xmath53 and @xmath54 , thus we find that    @xmath55 + \\left\\langle i\\right\\rangle ^{2}\\ ] ]    what gives @xmath56 @xmath57 .$ ] and thus the relative error is described by @xmath58 ^{1/2 } \\\\ &   &   \\\\ & = & \\left ( 2\\frac{\\left\\langle \\delta ^{2}\\right\\rangle } { \\left\\langle \\delta \\right\\rangle ^{2}}\\right ) ^{1/2}\\frac{(\\ln 10\\ n_{dec}w\\ l)^{-1/2}}{% ( p_{\\max } -p_{\\min } ) ^{1/2}}\\left [ \\frac{q-\\tanh ( q/2)}{q}\\right ] ^{1/2 } \\\\ &   &   \\\\ & = & k\\left ( \\frac{q-\\tanh ( q/2)}{q}\\right ) ^{1/2}% \\end{array } \\label{hiperbolic_equation}\\]]where @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus by considering the variable @xmath60 being uniformly distributed , the relative error behaves as a simple logistic function of the band gap amplitude ( @xmath48 ) .    aiming to propose a more realistic model then the supposition of the density of states following an uniform distribution , we propose an alternative model that considers the density of states as being quadratically distributed . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical quadratic function is a reasonable approximation to experimental results @xcite and is simpler than the polynomial fit to those experimental data . for this , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical @xmath61shape modeled as a quadratic function defined in the interval @xmath62 $ ] is here proposed :    @xmath63    supposing normalization @xmath64 @xmath65 , i.e. , @xmath66 , we have @xmath67and from the existence condition @xmath68 and then @xmath69    following the same procedure used before ( density of states uniformly - distributed ) now applied to the case which the density of states follows a quadratic curve , we first calculate the first moment and then compute the average of current considering the random telegraph noise caused by all traps in the interface : @xmath70 } { ( 1+\\cosh q)}dq% \\end{array } \\label{current}\\ ] ]    this result must be obtained by using numerical methods for each @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath72 , we have the expected @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> we tested many values @xmath69 and no meaningful deviates of @xmath74 were observed . </S>",
    "<S> indeed just corrections of order @xmath75 were verified , and there are no evidences to believe there might be large deviations for the current considering our theoretical u - shape curve . </S>",
    "<S> our tests were performed using @xmath76 , and to perform it , just values @xmath77 were considered . </S>",
    "<S> we have employed the simpsom rule ( see for example @xcite ) for the numeric integration of equation current . </S>",
    "<S> the reader might think @xmath71 is very small and differences would be observed at higher values of @xmath71 . in order to clarify this issue , we experimented @xmath78 up to@xmath79corresponding to @xmath80 and the same conclusion was obtained : @xmath81 is constant under @xmath48 variations . thus , the relationship between @xmath81 and @xmath48 is independent of @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most accurate model comes from the actual density of states , which can be measured from experimental data as in @xcite and fitted by a polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified the differences in the mosfet current fluctuations between modeling the band - gap as a uniform distribution , a theoretical u - shape modeled by the simple quadratic function described by equation [ theoretical_u_shape_curve ] and the actual experimental data fitted by a @xmath82-degree polynomial .    </S>",
    "<S> the procedure of using the experimental density of states consists of performing a scan of the figures of the experimental density of states found in @xcite , i.e. , the density of traps having energy @xmath83 , corresponding to @xmath60 , here denoted by @xmath84 .    in that work </S>",
    "<S> 3 u - shape curves are studied , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and , @xmath87 , corresponding to 3 different oxides ( in the nomenclature of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , reoxidized : oxide i , nitrided : oxide ii and , tceoxide : oxide iii ) defined in a symmetric band gap interval @xmath88 $ ] . the first step was to map this band gap to an interval @xmath62 $ ] , what was done with the simple transformation @xmath89 $ ] . for our scanning </S>",
    "<S> @xmath90 points , @xmath91 , were collected from experimental figures and fitted by a 8-degree polynomial ( @xmath92 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of 8 was used because it presents a good visual fit for all u - shape curves . </S>",
    "<S> a normalization is required , and thus @xmath93 @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , for @xmath96 $ ] . and </S>",
    "<S> so a polynomial fit was performed for each value attributed to @xmath48 changing from @xmath97 to @xmath98 and after we have the experimental probability distribution describing the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> next we perform numerical integrations of the equations for the current and the relative error obtained in this manuscript , which are performed using simpsom method with a very small step ( @xmath99 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it supplies high precision for the integration and so for our estimates . </S>",
    "<S> these simple procedures are implemented in fortran .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ plot_experimental_density_of_states ] shows the experimental u - shapes . </S>",
    "<S> the inside figure corresponds to an example of good polynomial fit performed for the one of the oxides ( tceoxide ) . </S>",
    "<S> so we perform calculations to obtain @xmath81 .     for the same @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> ]    in figure [ current_experimental ] we can observe that @xmath101 decays as function of @xmath48 which is not observed when the density of states is uniform or even when the curve is the theoretical u - shape . </S>",
    "<S> this corroborates the idea that the asymmetry of the u - shape might be important to observe the current differences that appear when @xmath48 changes . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is important to notice that the average noise current decays at most @xmath102 ( for the tceoxide ) , for high values of q. since q for s@xmath6o@xmath7 is approximately 2 , in this case the decrease is nearly 5% . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to analyze the relative error in the current by computing its higher moments .     </S>",

    "<S> the results show a decay which is not observed when the density of states is uniform or even when our theoretical u - shape density of states is considered . ]    </S>",

    "<S> integrating numerically the last equation we have in the left plot of figure [ quadratic_density ] the behavior of @xmath106 as function of @xmath48 , for different value of @xmath107 showing that the relative error is sensitive for different and small ( possible ) values of @xmath71 . for a suitable comparison , </S>",
    "<S> it is plotted in the same figure the case @xmath108 , which corresponds to the uniform distribution of density of states . </S>",
    "<S> the inside plot shows the same plot in a log - log scale . </S>",
    "<S> for higher values of @xmath71 a power law behavior can be adopted to describe the @xmath109 @xmath48 . </S>",

    "<S> it was used @xmath115 and @xmath111 for the plots.,title=\"fig : \" ]    these results show that the relative error in the current is not universal since the relative error shows different behavior depending on the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> finally we have performed the same calculations for the relative error considering the experimental u - shapes , as shown in figure experimental_relative_error . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a difference in the dependence of @xmath116 between the 3 different u - shapes . a similar behavior ( logistic curve ) , predicted for the uniform case ( see equation [ hiperbolic_equation ] ) , is observed using the experimental u - shapes , however there is a sensitive difference for higher values of @xmath48 between the two cases . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical approach for the u - shape supplies exactly an intermediate behavior between the uniform and experimental u - shape results , showing it is suitable for modeling rts noise in mosfets because it is simpler then the higher - order polynomial fit and more accurate than the uniform case !     for the experimental u - shapes . </S>",
    "<S> ]    summarizing , we developed an original methodology in time domain to model the noise behavior due to traps at the s@xmath6-s@xmath6o@xmath7 interface . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the relative error depends on the amplitude ( @xmath48 ) of the density of states at the interface .    our model for the average current and its relative error depends upon the model of the density of states adopted . when considering the density of states as having uniform or quadratic density of trap energies in the band gap </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the relative error behaves as a logistic function in relation to q. for the density of states modeled as an uniform distribution , a very simple formulation can still capture a logistic behavior similar to the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental u - shapes show a decay in the average current not observed when the theoretical u - shape is considered . </S>",
    "<S> such results represent an important advance in modelling rts at device and circuit levels , and experiments can be performed to check these behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that device designers can use the models proposed in this work for modeling the relative error as a function of the band - gap in upcoming technologies . </S>"
