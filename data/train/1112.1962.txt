    "nowadays , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been established as the fundamental gauge theory of the strong interaction .",

    "we also investigate the correspondence between color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking using the dirac - mode expansion in a gauge - invariant manner .",
    "many theoretical physicists consider that confinement phenomenon is brought by low - energy region of qcd , because of the strong qcd coupling in the infrared ( ir ) region .",
    "however , at the quantitative level , it is difficult to state the `` relevant energy region '' for confinement directly from qcd .",

'' _    in this section , to get the answer , we study quantitative lattice - qcd analysis for the relevant gluon - momentum region for color confinement @xcite , based on the fourier expansion of the link - variable .",

    "as a remarkable fact , the string tension is almost unchanged even after cutting off the high - momentum gluon component above 1.5gev , as shown in fig.3(b ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , the confinement property originates from the low - momentum gluon component below 1.5gev , which is the upper limit to contribute to @xmath2 .",

    "however , the response pattern against the cut is rather different from that on confinement , and higher - momentum gluons also contribute to the chiral condensate .",
    "next , we newly develop a manifestly gauge - covariant expansion of the qcd operator such as the wilson loop , using the eigen - mode of the qcd dirac operator @xmath3 , and investigate the relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .      the previous method is based on the fourier expansion , i.e. , the eigen - mode expansion of the momentum operator @xmath42 .",

    "we consider a gauge - invariant method , using a gauge - covariant expansion in qcd instead of the fourier expansion .",
    "in fact , we consider a generalization of the fourier expansion or an alternative expansion with keeping the gauge symmetry .",
    "a straight generalization is to use the covariant derivative operator @xmath44 instead of the derivative operator @xmath45 .",
    "however , due to the non - commutable nature of @xmath46 \\ne 0 $ ] , one can not diagonalize all the covariant derivative @xmath44 ( @xmath47 ) simultaneously , but only one of them can be diagonalized .",
    "for example , the eigen - mode expansion of @xmath48 keeps gauge covariance and is rather interesting , but this type of the expansion inevitably breaks the lorentz covariance .",
    "then , we consider the eigen - mode expansion of the dirac operator @xmath49 or @xmath50 , since such an expansion keeps both gauge symmetry and lorentz covariance .    in particular , the dirac - mode expansion is rather interesting because the dirac operator @xmath51 directly connects with chiral symmetry breaking via the banks - casher relation @xcite and its zero modes are related to the topological charge via the atiyah - singer index theorem @xcite . here",
    ", we mainly consider the manifestly gauge - invariant new method using the dirac - mode expansion .",
    "thus , the dirac - mode expansion has some important merits .    *",
    "the dirac - mode expansion method manifestly keeps both gauge and lorentz invariance . *",
    "each qcd phenomenon can be directly investigated in terms of chiral symmetry breaking .      in particular",
    ", it is rather interesting and important to examine the correlation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , since the direct relation is not yet shown between them in qcd .",
    "the strong correlation between them has been suggested by the simultaneous phase transitions of deconfinement and chiral restoration in lattice qcd both at finite temperature @xcite and in a small - volume box @xcite .",
    "the close relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking has been also suggested in terms of the monopole / vortex degrees of freedom @xcite , which topologically appears in qcd by taking the maximally abelian / center gauge @xcite .",
    "for example , by removing the monopoles , confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are simultaneously lost in lattice qcd @xcite , as schematically shown in fig.5 .",
    "this indicates an important role of the monopole to both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , and these two nonperturbative qcd phenomena seem to be related via the monopole .",
