    "in the simplest possible terms , the nave expectation from hierarchical structure formation scenarios is that the most massive galaxies form last .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the so  called downsizing of galaxy growth .",
    "these observations have been accommodated within the @xmath12cdm framework with the introduction of a quenching mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which operates to shut down star formation in the most massive galaxies ; this mechanism is also required to correctly predict the absolute and relative numbers of red galaxies @xcite . with this inclusion",
    ", models thus predict that a significant fraction of the local massive galaxy population should have finished their star formation relatively early in the history of the universe , with later mergers working to build up the most massive galaxies .",
    "there is thus a crucial distinction to be made between a galaxy s mean stellar age , and the time since that galaxy has assumed its present form ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the most massive galaxies are expected to be both the oldest _ and _ the youngest galaxies .",
    "they are the oldest in the sense that their progenitors are expected to form first in the highest cosmic overdensities  however , these stars are only assembled into their @xmath13 configuration relatively recently .",
    "this leaves ( at least ) two open questions relating to the quenching of star formation and the formation and evolution of massive galaxies : 1 . )",
    "when does star formation stop in massive galaxies , and 2 . )",
    "what happens to galaxies after they have stopped forming stars ?    in connection with the first of these questions , deep spectroscopic surveys have identified massive galaxies with little or no ongoing star formation at @xmath14 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "while these techniques are deliberately biased towards certain kinds of galaxies and certain redshift intervals , advances in techniques for photometric redshift estimation and stellar population modeling have allowed the selection of mass - limited samples , and so the construction of representative samples of the high redshift massive galaxy population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "of the 36 @xmath16 , @xmath17 m@xmath3  galaxies in the @xcite sample , 16 were shown unambiguously to have evolved stellar populations and little or no ongoing star formation .",
    "these galaxies also seem to form a red sequence in @xmath18 color , although at low significance ( @xmath19 ; * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , these massive galaxies appear both to have assembled stellar populations similar to galaxies of comparable mass in the local universe , and to have had their star formation effectively quenched .    using keck laser guide - star assisted adaptive optics and hubble space telescope imaging , van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2008 , hereafter vd08 ) measured sizes for 9 of the 16 strongly quenched galaxies from the @xcite sample .",
    "they found ( rest - frame optical ) effective radii in the range 0.52.4 kpc ; that is , smaller than typical galaxies of the same mass in the local universe by factors of 310 .",

    "have found similarly compact sizes for massive galaxy samples drawn from @xmath20 spectroscopic surveys .",
    "further , @xcite have recently measured a velocity dispersion of @xmath21 km / s for one of the galaxies in the vd08 sample , based on a 29 hr nir spectrum ; this extremely high value is consistent with the galaxy s measured mass and size .",

    "the significance of these results is that while the massive and largely quiescent galaxies at @xmath22 have stellar populations that are consistent with their being more or less ` fully formed ' early type galaxies , they must _ each _ undergo significant structural evolution in order to develop into galaxies like the ones seen in the local universe . taken together",
    ", these results thus paint a consistent picture of strong size evolution among massive , early type and/or red sequence galaxies  both as a population and individually  even after their star formation has been quenched ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the details of the sdss spectroscopic sample selection are given in @xcite ; we will summarize the most relevant aspects of this process in [ ch : selectfx ]",
    ".      for the basic sdss catalog , there are two different methods for performing photometry .",
    "the first , the ` petrosian ' magnitude , is derived from the observed , azimuthally averaged ( 1d ) light profile .",
    "the petrosian radius is defined as the point where the mean surface brightness in an annulus drops to a set fraction ( _ viz . _  0.2 ) of the mean surface brightness within a circular aperture of the same radius . within sdss",
    ", the petrosian aperture is defined to be twice the petrosian radius ; this aperture will contain 99 % of the total light for a well resolved exponential disk , but may miss as much as 18 % of the light for a de vaucouleurs @xmath29 profile @xcite .",
    "the second photometric measure is derived from fits to the observed ( 2d ) distribution of light in each band , using a sector - fitting technique , in which concentric annuli are divided into 12 30@xmath30 sectors , as described in appendix a.1 of @xcite .",
    "these fits are done assuming either an exponential or a de vaucouleurs profile , convolved with a fit to the appropriate psf . for each profile , the structural parameters ( _ viz . _",
    "axis ratio , position angle , and scalelength ) are determined from the @xmath31 band image .",
    "the more likely ( in a @xmath32 sense ) of the two profile fits is used to define ` model ' magnitudes for each galaxy . for the @xmath33 bands ,",
    "these parameters are then held fixed , and only overall normalization ( _ ie._total flux ) is fit for .",
    "the basic catalog also provides two different measures of size , associated with these two magnitude measurements .",
    "the petrosian half - light radius , @xmath34 , is defined as the radius enclosing half the ` total ' petrosian flux .",
    "the catalog also contains best fit structural parameters , including the effective radius , from a separate set of fits to each band independently , again for both an exponential and a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "note that whereas the petrosian magnitude and size are derived from the observed , psf - convolved radial profile , the model values provide a psf - corrected measure of the intrinsic size .",
    "we use model magnitudes to construct @xmath35 seds for each object , since these measurements are seeing  corrected . from dr7",
    ", the basic sdss photometric calibration has been refined so that the photometry is given in the ab magnitude system without the need for any further corrections @xcite .",
    "for measuring sizes , we will rely on the best - fit model effective radius , @xmath36 , as determined from the @xmath37 band .",
    "we also adopt a minimum measured size of @xmath38 , corresponding to half the median psf fwhm for the sdss imaging ; we will plot all galaxies with observed sizes smaller than @xmath38 as upper limits .",
    "( none of our conclusions depend on the choice of this limit , which ultimately affects only 5 of our lower - mass compact galaxy candidates . )",
    "we have derived rest - frame photometry for each object , based on its observed @xmath35 sed and redshift , using the idl utility interrest @xcite , with a redshift grid of @xmath39 . in order to minimize the k - corrections and their associated errors , we determine rest - frame photometry through the @xmath35 filters redshifted to @xmath40 , which we denote with a superscript 0.1 .",

    "our compact galaxy selection is roughly equivalent to @xmath225 m@xmath3kpc@xmath223 ; nearly half ( 28/63 ) of our compact galaxy candidates satisfy the @xcite @xmath226 criterion . for their sample , @xcite derive a number density of @xmath227 mpc@xmath190 ; to our mass limit of @xmath79 m@xmath3 , this value becomes @xmath228 mpc@xmath190 .",
    "these values are solid lower limits , as they assume that no such galaxies exist outside of the clusters observed by wings . for our sample , however , the number density of @xmath79 m@xmath3  galaxies with @xmath229 m@xmath3  kpc@xmath190 is just @xmath230 mpc@xmath190 .",
    "that is , after correcting as best we can for the different stellar mass limits , our number densities are inconsistent by a factor of more than 40 with those found by @xcite .",
    "again , our use of @xmath37-band effective radii leads to smaller measured sizes than for bluer bands ; this discrepancy would only increase using @xmath31- or @xmath169-band measured sizes .",
    "either our results are badly affected by unexplained selection effects , or there are large discrepancies between our size and mass estimates and those of @xcite .    we have considered possible spectroscopic selection effects that could bias against bright , compact objects in [ ch : selectfx ] , and shown these to be relevant for @xmath166 .",
    "these effects may well explain why @xcite were able to match only a small fraction of their compact galaxies ( which have @xmath231 ) to objects in the ( dr4 ) sdss spectroscopic catalog .",
    "we have shown , however , that our @xmath232 results are not strongly affected by these kinds of selection effects ( figure [ fig : sizecomp ] , see also appendix a ) .",
    "our estimated completeness is more than 60 % for all galaxies in the @xcite sample and greater than 90 % for 90 % of the sample .",
    "the selection effects considered in [ ch : selectfx ] thus can not explain the difference in our inferred number densities .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the @xcite galaxies only exist in rich clusters , and that sdss suffers much higher spectroscopic incompleteness in such dense fields because of fiber collisions .",
    "a completely indepdendent estimate can be obtained from the @xcite sample : we find that 5/319 of these galaxies have sizes smaller than the mass  size relation by a factor of 2 or more .",
    "this fraction for clusters that is approximately 15 times higher than what we find for all galaxies in sdss .",
    "while not conclusive , this does suggest that sdss may suffer from additional incompleteness beyond the effects we consider here .",
    "that said , we note that several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found little or no evidence for an environmental dependence of the size  mass relation within sdss .",
    "thus we can find no easy explanation for the difference between the @xcite results and our own . here again , velocity dispersion measurements would provide an useful consistency check on the @xcite size and mass measurements .    even despite these differences ,",
    "however , we note that @xcite conclude that  barring large systematic errors in the high - redshift measurements  at least 65 % ( _ cf .",
    "_  our value of 100% ) of the @xmath6 galaxies from @xcite and at least 20 % ( _ cf .",
    "_  our value of 60 % ) of the @xmath186 galaxies from @xcite have disappeared from the local universe . accepting the high - redshift results",
    ", these galaxies simply can not evolve passively and statically into the red sequence and/or early type galaxies found in the local universe .",
    "the central question of this work has been the existence or otherwise of massive , compact , quiescent and/or early type galaxies in the local universe , and particularly the importance of selection effects in the sdss spectroscopic sample for such galaxies .",
    "we have shown that , especially for lower redshifts ( @xmath166 ) , galaxies with the masses and sizes of those found at @xmath22 would not be targeted for spectroscopic followup ( figure [ fig : sizemass ] ) .",
    "the main reason for this is not the star / galaxy separation criterion , but rather the exclusion of bright and compact targets in order to avoid saturation and cross - talk in the spectrograph ( see [ ch : selectfx ] ) .",
    "we have therefore conducted a search for massive , compact galaxies at @xmath8 , where these selection effects should be less important .",
    "we estimate that for @xmath8 , the average completeness for galaxies like those from @xcite and @xcite would be @xmath110 % at worst , and @xmath233 % on average ( figure [ fig : sizecomp ] ) .    starting from a sample of massive ( @xmath234 m@xmath3 ) red sequence ( @xmath76 ) galaxies ,",
    "we have selected the 280 galaxies with inferred sizes that are a factor of 2 or more smaller than would be expected from the @xcite @xmath61@xmath36 relation for early type galaxies . in order to confirm their photometry and size measurements ,",
    "we have visually inspected all of these objects .",
    "unsurprisingly , by selecting the most extreme outliers , a large fraction of these objects ( @xmath235% ) appear to be instances where the size and/or stellar mass estimates are unreliable ( [ ch : candidates ] ) .    for the 63 galaxies with no obvious reason to suspect their size or stellar mass estimates , there is good agreement between the default sdss size measurement ( based on the 2d light distribution , using a sector - fitting algorithm , and assuming a de vaucouleurs profile ) , and those given in the nyu vagc ( based on the azimuthally average growth curve , assuming a more general srsic  profile ) .",
    "however , particularly for galaxies with high @xmath68 , the de vaucouleurs size measurement is systematically smaller than the srsic  one , at the level of @xmath236 % ( [ ch : sizes ] ) .    in general , and",
    "as expected , our 63 compact galaxy candidates have significantly higher than average velocity dispersions ( figure [ fig : deldel ] ) .",
    "while it remains possible that the sizes of at least some of our compact galaxy candidates may have had their sizes underestimated by @xmath237 % , in general , the relatively high observed velocity dispersions support the notion that they are indeed unusually compact given their stellar masses ( [ ch : veldisps ] ) .    among our compact galaxy candidates ,",
    "there are no galaxies with sizes comparable to those found @xmath6 by @xcite ; we find analogs for @xmath194 % of the @xcite galaxies at @xmath238 ( figures [ fig : sizecomp ] and [ fig : sizedists ] ) .",
    "this lack can not be explained by selection effects . to confirm this ,",
    "we have also compared the size  mass diagram , constructed using photometric redshifts , based on both the full photometric sample and the spectroscopic sub - sample ( appendix [ ch : photsample ] ) . while it is conceivable that sdss is missing a few massive , compact galaxies , there are again no signs of galaxies comparable to those of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "it is not impossible that some systematic errors in the estimation of @xmath59s for the high redshift galaxies ( e.g. , an evolving stellar imf ) mean that their stellar masses are vastly overestimated , however it would require an overestimate of @xmath239 dex to reconcile the @xcite galaxies with the sizes of the smallest galaxies we have identified in the sdss catalog .",
    "accepting the high redshift observations at face value , then , our results confirm that massive galaxies , both individually and as a population , must undergo considerable structural evolution over the interval @xmath187 in order to develop into the kinds of galaxies seen locally  even after star formation in these galaxies has effectively ended .",
    "we see some hints that a significant amount of this evolution ( @xmath194 % ) may have already occurred by @xmath240 .",
    "the fact that each and every one of the @xcite galaxies must undergo significant structural evolution to match the properties of present - day galaxies implies that the mechanism that drives this growth must apply more or less evenly to all galaxies . to see this ,",
    "let us assume that some external process drives the size evolution of these galaxies , and that even a single event is sufficient to move an individual galaxy onto the main size ",
    "mass relation .",
    "then , we can assume some simple probability distribution for the number of events , @xmath241 , among individual galaxies .",
    "( for example , we could assume that events occur randomly across the time interval @xmath242 , or that each galaxy experiences @xmath243 events . ) now , our results suggest that the number density of @xcite  like galaxies drops by at least a factor of 5000 since @xmath6 .",
    "in order to ensure that at most 1/5000 galaxies have @xmath244 after @xmath6 , simple probabilistic arguments imply that the average galaxy must undergo @xmath245 events .",
    "this would imply that a strongly stochastic process like major mergers can not be the primary mechanism for the strong size evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "apart from their small sizes and high velocity dispersions , our compact galaxy candidates are not obviously distinct from the general population ( figure [ fig : props ] ) .",
    "if anything , at fixed velocity dispersion , our compact galaxies have stellar populations that are slightly younger than average ( at @xmath246 significance ) .",
    "even so , the majority of these galaxies stellar populations are definitely ` old ' , with luminosity - weighted mean stellar ages typically in the range 610 gyr .",
    "but if some external mechanism drives the size evolution of these galaxies , we speculate that their small sizes may indicate that they have assumed their present form comparatively _ early _ , and in this sense they may actually be relatively _ old _ ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if so , with better understanding of the processes that determine the sizes of early type galaxies , and in particular the role of merging , the properties of these galaxies could provide a means of constraining the evolution of massive galaxies after they have completed their star formation , including their late - time merger histories .",
    "in this appendix , we present a complementary analysis in which we directly compare the spectroscopic and photometric samples , in order to test the conclusion that the lack of massive , compact galaxies in the spectroscopic sample can not be explained by the selection effects .          before we can address the question of massive compact galaxies in the sdss photometric sample , we must first devise a means of separating stars and galaxies without selecting on the basis of observed size or light profile .",
    "our method for doing so is shown in figure  [ fig : colselect ] , which plots the observed ( extinction - corrected ) @xmath247 colors of different classes of objects from the spectroscopic sample ; we show : all galaxies ( grey ) , @xmath248 galaxies ( bright red ) , and those with @xmath76 ( dark red ) , o  k stars ( dark blue ) , m - type or later stars ( light blue ) , and quasars ( yellow ) .    the black box shown in figure  [",
    "fig : colselect ] shows our criteria for selecting @xmath8 galaxies based on their @xmath247 colors : @xmath249 again , we apply this selection in terms of model colors . note how , whereas the stellar sequence is reasonably well separated from the region of color space occupied by galaxies for @xmath250 , beyond this point , the late - type stellar sequence turns up , such that late - type stars and galaxies are blended . in the most general terms",
    "possible , the mean galaxy redshift increases towards redder @xmath251 colors .",
    "this means that our ability to distinguish red galaxies from late - type stars on the basis of their optical seds is limited to @xmath252 .    in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : colselect ] , we zoom in on this selection region . from this panel , it is clear that a large proportion of quasars will also be included in our color - selected ` galaxy ' sample .",
    "similarly , it is clear that this color selection is not 100 % efficient in excluding stars from our sample : more quantitatively , with this selection we are able to exclude more than 80 % of spectroscopically identified stars that are given @xmath253 , while retaining more than 97 % of all @xmath253 galaxies .",
    "furthermore , it should be remembered that stars are already heavily selected against for the spectroscopic sample plotted in figure  [ fig : colselect ] ; the relative number of stellar ` contaminants ' may well be considerably higher for the photometric sample .",
    "a major improvement in dr7 is a complete revision in how the basic ( ` photoz ` ) photometric redshifts are derived @xcite . rather than using some combination of synthetic template spectra to reproduce the observed colors of individual galaxies , the new ` photoz ` algorithm",
    "directly compares the observed photometry of individual galaxies to that of galaxies that have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "specifically , for each individual object , the algorithm finds the 100 closest neighbours in @xmath35 color space , and fits a hyper - plane to these points , rejecting outliers ; the redshift is then determined by interpolating along this 4d surface . in comparison to the dr6 algorithm ,",
    "this reduces the rms redshift error by more than 75 % ( @xmath254 = 0.025 ) , and significantly reduces systematic errors @xcite .    for this analysis , rather than full sed - fit stellar mass estimates assuming the photometric redshifts",
    ", we will simply make use of the empirical relation between @xmath48 color and @xmath59 ( equation [ eq : mls ] ) . in this way",
    ", we are able to recover the @xmath255-derived , sed - fit @xmath59s of the sample of galaxies shown in figure [ fig : mls ] to 0.045 dex ( @xmath256 ) ; including the effects of photometric redshift errors , k - corrections , and @xmath59 errors , the total ( @xmath256 ) error in @xmath61 is 0.13 dex .",
    "this should be compared to the median formal error on the original sed - fit stellar mass estimates , 0.10 dex ; that is , the errors on @xmath61 based on photometric masses ( adding these two errors in quadrature ) are only about 60 % greater than those based on spectroscopic redshifts .      , based on the spectroscopic and the full photometric sdss catalogs .",

    "again , objects with measured sizes smaller than @xmath38 are shown as upper limits , assuming a size of @xmath38 .",
    "when comparing these three different analyses , the difference between ( _ a_. )  and ( _ b_. )  shows the effect of using spectroscopic versus photometric redshifts , and the difference between ( _ b_. )  and ( _ c_.)shows the difference between the sdss spectroscopic and photometric selection .",
    "that is , the comparison between ( _ b_. )  and ( _ c_. )  gives a direct indication of the level of incompleteness in the spectroscopic sample .",
    "looking at panels ( _ a_. )  and ( _ b_. ) , it is clear that the use of photometric redshifts produces a considerably greater scatter in the size  mass diagram , including a rather large number of galaxies with inferred stellar masses of @xmath263 m@xmath3  or greater .",
    "there is a clear excess of unresolved objects with inferred stellar masses greater than @xmath264 m@xmath3  in panel ( _ b_. )  in comparison to panel ( _ a_. ) however , we already know from section [ ch : specsample ] that there are no objects in the spectroscopic sample with these sizes and masses  these objects can not be genuine compact galaxies .",

    "turning now to the comparison between panels ( _ b_. )  and ( _ c_. ) , the first point to make is that the excess of unresolved sources is even more pronounced .",
    "we have matched all of these objects to the 2mass point source catalog in order to investigate their nir colors .",

    "19 objects are the central point sources of very large spiral galaxies ; most of these are also found in the rosat and/or first catalogs .",
    "we also note that there are 17 very small disk or irregular galaxies with red point sources at or very near their centers .",
    "most of these also have proper motion measurements from the usno - b catalog , and several are spectrally identified as late type stars ; it seems plausible that these galaxies simply have foreground stars coincidentally superposed very near their centers .    in short , of the 434 objects from the full photometric sample that , on the basis of photometric redshifts , are inferred to have @xmath275 m@xmath3  and @xmath276 dex , not one remains as a viable compact galaxy candidate .",
    "the conclusion from both the analyses that we have now presented is that there are no galaxies in the local universe with sizes and masses comparable to the compact galaxies found at higher redshifts . in figure",

    "we plot those objects with observed sizes smaller than @xmath38 separately as the light grey filled histogram , and the thin black and red histograms .    as in [ ch : sizemass3 ] , the difference between the filled and solid black histogram , both of which are derived from the spectroscopic sample , shows the increased scatter due to the use of photometric redshifts .",
    "similarly , the difference between the black and red histograms show the difference between the spectroscopic and photometric samples , and so allow a quantification of the bias in the spectroscopic sample . by simply tallying the numbers of galaxies with @xmath279 ,",
