    "in - plane current - induced spin - orbit spin transfer torques in ferromagnet / heavy metal bilayers provide an efficient way of inducing magnetization dynamics and may play a role in future magnetoelectronic devices .",
    "@xcite two mechanisms for spin - orbit torques have been proposed to date ; the bulk spin hall effect in the heavy metal layer  @xcite and interfacial spin - orbit coupling effect at the ferromagnet / heavy metal interface  @xcite frequently referred to as the rashba effect .",
    "substantial efforts have been expended in identifying the dominant mechanism for the spin - orbit torque .",
    "@xcite for this purpose , one needs to go beyond qualitative analysis since both the mechanisms result in qualitatively identical predictions , i.e. two vector components of spin - orbit torque ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sot ] ) ) . for quantitative analysis",
    ", we adopt the commonly used decomposition of the spin - orbit torque @xmath0 , @xmath1 where the first term is commonly called the field - like spin - orbit torque , the second term the damping - like spin - orbit torque or the slonczewski - like spin - orbit torque , @xmath2 is the unit vector along the magnetization direction , @xmath3 is the unit vector perpendicular to both current direction ( @xmath4 ) and the direction in which the inversion symmetry is broken ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7 describe the magnitude of field - like and damping - like spin - orbit torque terms , respectively . since @xmath0 should be orthogonal to @xmath8 , the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sot ] ) , which are orthogonal to @xmath9 and also to each other , provide a perfectly general description of the spin - orbit torque regardless of the detailed mechanism of @xmath0 .",
    "the quantitative analysis of @xmath0 then amounts to the examination of the properties of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "one of intriguing features of spin - orbit torque observed in some experiments is the strong dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath10 on the magnetization direction .",
    "@xcite comparing the measured and calculated angular dependence will provide clues to the mechanism of the spin - orbit torque .",
    "the detailed angular dependence also determines the magnetization dynamics and hence is important for device applications based on magnetization switching  @xcite , domain wall dynamics  @xcite , and magnetic skyrmion motion  @xcite .",
    "theories based on the bulk spin hall effect combined with a drift - diffusion model or boltzmann transport equation  @xcite predict no angular dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which is not consistent with the experimental results .",
    "@xcite for theories based on the interfacial spin - orbit coupling , the angular dependence is subtle .",
    "based on the rashba model including dyakonov - perel spin relaxation , pauyac _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the angular dependence of spin - orbit torque perturbatively in weak rashba regime ( @xmath11 ) and strong rashba regime ( @xmath12 ) where @xmath13 is the strength of the rashba spin - orbit coupling , @xmath14 is the fermi wave vector , and @xmath15 is the exchange coupling .",
    "they found that both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are almost independent of the angular direction of @xmath9 in the weak rashba regime . in the strong rashba regime , on the other hand , they found that @xmath7 exhibits strong angular dependence .",
    "the origin of the angular dependence within this model is the anisotropy of the spin relaxation , which arises naturally since the rashba spin - orbit interaction is responsible for the anisotropic dyakonov - perel spin relaxation mechanism . for @xmath6 , in contrast , they found it to be almost constant in the strong rashba regime even when the spin relaxation is anisotropic .",
    "experimentally ,  @xcite both the damping - like and the field - like contributions depend strongly on the magnetization direction .    here",
    "we reexamine the angular dependence of the spin - orbit torque based on the rashba interaction motivated by the following two observations .",
    "the first motivation comes from a first - principles calculation  @xcite of co / pt bilayers , according to which both the spin - orbit potential and the exchange splitting are large near the interface between the heavy metal and the ferromagnet .",
    "this implies that the problem of interest is not in the analytically tractable weak rashba or strong rashba regime but in the intermediate rashba regime ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we examine this intermediate regime numerically and find that in contrast to both the strong and weak rashba regimes , @xmath6 has a strong angular dependence .",
    "the second motivation comes from a recent calculation  @xcite showing that the interfacial spin - orbit coupling can generate @xmath7 through a berry phase contribution  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , earlier theories  @xcite of the interfacial spin - orbit coupling found a separate contribution to @xmath7 from spin relaxation .",
    "moreover those calculations  @xcite suggest that the berry phase contribution to @xmath7 is much larger than the spin relaxation contribution . here",
    ", we examine the angular dependence of the berry phase contribution .",
    "to be specific , we examine the angular dependence of the spin - orbit torques for a free - electron model of two - dimensional ferromagnetic systems with the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "when an electric field is applied to generate an in - plane current , the spin - orbit torque arises from the two types of changes caused by the electric field .",
    "one is the electron occupation change . for a small electric field ,",
    "the net occupation change is limited to the fermi surface so that the spin - orbit torque caused by the occupation change comes from the fermi surface .",
    "for this reason , this contribution is referred to as the fermi surface contribution .",
    "the other is the state change .",
    "the electric field modifies the potential energy of the system , which in turn modifies wavefunctions of all single particle states .",
    "thus the spin - orbit torque caused by the state change comes not only from the states near the fermi surface but also from all states in the entire fermi sea .",
    "this contribution is referred to as the fermi sea contribution and often closely related to the momentum - space berry phase  @xcite .",
    "we find that in the absence of spin relaxation , the fermi surface contribution to @xmath7 is vanishingly small , while @xmath17 remains finite .",
    "the @xmath6 has a substantial angular dependence in the intermediate rashba regime .",
    "this nontrivial angular dependence of @xmath6 is related to fermi surface distortion , which becomes significant when the rashba spin - orbit coupling energy ( @xmath18 ) is comparable to the exchange coupling ( @xmath19 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the fermi sea contribution generates primarily @xmath7 which exhibits strong angular dependence in both the intermediate and strong rashba regimes .",
    "the nontrivial angular dependence of @xmath7 is caused by the combined effects of the fermi surface distortion and the fermi sea contribution .",
    "we also compute the angular dependence of the spin - orbit torques for a tight - binding model and find that the results are qualitatively consistent with those for a free - electron model .",
    "in this section , we use subscripts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to denote the fermi surface and the fermi sea contributions , respectively . the model hamiltonian for an electron in the absence of an external electric field is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the two - dimensional wave vector , @xmath22 is the electron mass , @xmath15 ( @xmath230 ) is the exchange parameter",
    ", @xmath24 is the momentum , and @xmath25 is the vector of pauli matrices , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the @xmath29- , @xmath30- , and @xmath31-components of @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath9 is position - independent , which will be assumed all throughout this paper , @xmath33 is a good quantum number . for each @xmath33",
    ", there are two energy eigenvalues since the spin may point in two different directions .",
    "thus the energy eigenvalues of @xmath34 form two energy bands , called majority and minority bands .",
    "the one - electron eigenenergy of @xmath34 is @xmath35 where the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to the majority ( minority ) band , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .    to determine the spin state of the majority and minority bands ,",
    "it is useful to combine the last two terms of @xmath34 into an effective zeeman energy term ( @xmath38 ) , where the effective magnetic field is @xmath33-dependent and given by @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the bohr magneton .",
    "@xmath41 fixes the spin direction of the majority and minority bands .",
    "for the eigenstate @xmath42 of an eigenstate in the majority / minority band , its spin expectation value @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the unit vector along @xmath46 .",
    "in terms of the @xmath33-dependent angle @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which are defined by @xmath49 , the eigenstate @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 together with the energy eigenvalue @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efem ] ) , the eigenstate @xmath50 completely specifies properties of the equilibrium hamiltonian . the ground state of the system is then achieved by filling up all single particle eigenstates @xmath50 , below the fermi energy @xmath53 .",
    "when an electric field @xmath54 is applied , one of the effects is the modification of the state occupation .",
    "this effect generates the non - equilibrium spin density @xmath55 as @xmath56    { { \\bf s}_{{\\bf k}(1)}^\\pm } ,    \\label{eq : sdfem1}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the electron charge , @xmath58 is the relaxation time , and @xmath59 is the zero - temperature electron occupation function where @xmath60 is the heaviside step function . note that the net contribution to @xmath55 arises entirely from the states near @xmath53 due to the cancellation effect between the two occupation functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdfem1 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath61 is a _ fermi surface _ contribution .",
    "the total spin density generated by the occupation change becomes @xmath62 .",
    "this is related to the spin - orbit torque @xmath63 generated by the occupation change via @xmath64 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdfem1 ] ) , we use the relaxation time approximation with the assumption that the scattering probability is isotropic and spin - independent .    the other important effect of the electric field other changing than the occupation is that it modifies the potential energy that the electrons feel , and hence modifies their wave functions , generating in turn a correction to @xmath65 .",
    "we call this correction @xmath66 .",
    "it is calculated in appendix  [ sec : appendixa ] and given by @xmath67.\\label{eq : skfem2}\\ ] ] summing over all occupied states in the majority / minority band , gives the total spin density @xmath68 generated by the state change in that band , and is given by @xmath69 note that the equilibrium occupation function @xmath70 appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdfem2 ] ) rather than the difference between the two occupation functions .",
    "the occupation change effect is ignored in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdfem2 ] ) since we are interested in linear effects of the electric field @xmath71 and @xmath66 is already first order in @xmath71 . note that all the occupied single particle states in the fermi sea contribute to @xmath68 .",
    "thus @xmath68 amounts is a _ fermi sea _ contribution .",
    "the total spin density generated by the state change becomes @xmath72 .",
    "this is related to the spin - orbit torque @xmath73 generated by the state change via @xmath74 .",
    "a few remarks are in order . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdfem1 ] ) , the two occupation functions cancel each other for most @xmath33 values .",
    "they do not cancel for @xmath33 points that correspond to electron excitation slightly above the fermi surface or the hole excitation slightly below the fermi surface .",
    "thus the direction of @xmath55 can be estimated simply by evaluating the difference of @xmath75 between two @xmath33 s of electron - like and hole - like excitations .",
    "this shows that @xmath61 points along @xmath76 .",
    "thus the spin - orbit torque @xmath77 should be proportional to @xmath78 , which is nothing but the field - like spin - orbit torque .",
    "thus the fermi surface contribution @xmath77 contributes mostly to @xmath6 . to be precise , however , this statement is not valid for spin - dependent scattering , which we neglect in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdfem1 ] ) .",
    "if the scattering is spin - dependent , @xmath77 produces @xmath7 as well as @xmath6 as demonstrated in refs .  .",
    "in this paper , we neglect the contribution to the angular dependence of @xmath7 from @xmath77 and spin - dependent scattering since it has been already treated in ref .  .",
    "the contribution to @xmath7 in our study comes from the fermi sea contribution @xmath73 .",
    "one can easily verify that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : skfem2 ] ) generates the spin - orbit torque proportional to @xmath79 , which has the form of the damping - like spin - orbit torque . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : skfem2 ] ) on the other hand almost vanishes upon @xmath33 integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdfem2 ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the fermi sea contribution @xmath73 contributes mostly to @xmath7 .",
    "we also compute the spin - orbit torques based on a tight - binding model because free electron models with linear rashba coupling , like we use here , can exhibit pathological behavior when accounting for vertex corrections to the impurity scattering .",
    "for example , the intrinsic spin hall effect  @xcite , that has the same physical origin of the fermi sea contribution to spin - orbit torque , gives a universal result that vanishes when vertex corrections are included .",
    "@xcite however , the intrinsic spin hall effect does not vanish when the electron dispersion deviates from free electron behavior or the spin - orbit coupling is not linear in momentum .",
    "@xcite since we neglect vertex corrections in the calculations presented in this paper , it is necessary to check whether or not the angular dependence of spin - orbit torque obtained in a free - electron model is qualitatively reproduced in a tight - binding model , where the electron dispersion deviates from free electron behavior and the spin - orbit coupling is not strictly linear in momentum . to compute spin - orbit torque in the two - band ( majority and minority spin bands ) tight - binding model on a square lattice with the lattice constant @xmath80",
    ", we replace @xmath81 and @xmath82 by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding spin density is then calculated by integrating the electric field - induced spin expectation value up to the point of band filling . for most cases in a tight - binding model , the result converges for a @xmath33-point mesh with mesh spacing @xmath85=0.052 nm@xmath86 and 80,000 @xmath33-points , where the convergence criteria is 1 percent change of results with a finer mesh by factor of 2 .",
    "all results presented in this paper are converged to this criteria .",
    "we first discuss fermi surface distortion as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the fermi surface and the spin direction at each @xmath33-point for various values of the ratio @xmath88 . without rashba",
    "spin - orbit coupling @xmath89 , the spin direction does not depend on @xmath90 for ferromagnetic systems ( fig . [ fig1](a ) ) . without exchange coupling ( non - magnetic rashba system @xmath91 ) , on the other hand , the spins point in the azimuthal direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "for these extreme cases , the fermi surfaces of two bands are concentric circles .",
    "the fermi surfaces distort significantly when @xmath92 .",
    "figure [ fig1](c ) compares two fermi surfaces ( majority band ) for @xmath93 and @xmath94 when @xmath95 .",
    "when the magnetization has an in - plane component as in this case , each sheet of the fermi surface shifts in a different direction and distorts from perfect circularity ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) : note that the dotted fermi surface is for @xmath93 and is a circle ) .",
    "this distortion arises because the @xmath33-dependent effective magnetic field ( eq .  ( [ eq : bfem ] ) )",
    "contains contributions both from the exchange and rashba spin - orbit couplings .",
    "an effective field from the exchange is aligned along @xmath96 and uniform regardless of @xmath33 , whereas that from the rashba spin - orbit coupling lies in the @xmath97 plane and is @xmath33-dependent .",
    "for example , for @xmath95 and majority band , an effective field from the rashba spin - orbit coupling is parallel ( anti - parallel ) to that from the exchange at @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , where @xmath100 ( @xmath23 0 ) and @xmath101 ( @xmath102 0 ) are the fermi wave vectors corresponding to the electric field - induced electron - like and hole - like excitations , respectively . the @xmath103-dependent effective field distorts the fermi surface distortion as demonstrated in fig . [ fig1](c)-(f ) .",
    "this fermi surface distortion also affects the spin direction at each @xmath33-point because the spin eigendirection is @xmath33-dependent due to the rashba spin - orbit coupling . in the weak ( strong ) rashba regime ,",
    "the spin landscape is similar with that in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) . in these extreme cases ,",
    "the spin landscape is not significantly modified by the change in the magnetization direction as one of the effective fields ( either from the exchange or from the rashba spin - orbit coupling ) is much stronger than the other . as a result , @xmath6 has almost no angular distortion in these regimes .",
    "the spin landscape for @xmath16 on the other hand becomes highly complicated ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](d)-(f ) ) as the fermi surface distortion is maximized .",
    "one can easily verify that the spin landscape for @xmath16 varies significantly with the magnetization direction because the fermi surface distortion is closely related to the in - plane component of the magnetization as explained above .",
    "as the non - equilibrium spin density corresponding to @xmath6 ( i.e. @xmath104 ) is obtained from the integration of the spins on the fermi surface , this magnetization - angle - dependent change in the spin landscape generates a nontrivial angular dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "a similar argument is valid for @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath105 ) which comes from the fermi sea contribution because the fermi surface distortion affects the interval of the integration .",
    "therefore , the results shown in fig . [ fig1 ] suggest that the spin - orbit torque originating from the interfacial spin - orbit coupling should have a strong dependence on the magnetization angles @xmath106 and @xmath107 when @xmath88 is close to 1 .",
    "several additional remarks for the fermi surface distortion are as follows .",
    "first , the two fermi surfaces touch exactly for @xmath108 ( fig . [ fig1](e ) ) and they anticross for @xmath109 ( fig . [ fig1](f ) ) . as a result , the spin landscape rapidly changes when @xmath88 varies around 1 so that a similar drastic change in the angular dependence of the spin - orbit torque is expected .",
    "second , all effects from the fermi surface distortion , described for a free - electron model above , should also affect the results obtained for a tight - binding model .",
    "however , as the shape of the fermi surface is different for the two models ( i.e. for @xmath110 and @xmath111 , the fermi surface for a free - electron model is a circle , whereas that for a tight - binding model with half band - filling is a rhombus ) , the results for the two models are quantitatively different .    )",
    "dependence of field - like spin - orbit torque coefficient @xmath6 . free - electron model ( a and b ) : ( a ) azimuthal angle of magnetization @xmath107 = 0 and ( b ) @xmath112 . tight - binding model ( c and d ) : ( c ) @xmath113 and ( d ) @xmath112 . for a free - electron model , we use @xmath53= 10 ev , @xmath114 , and @xmath15= 1 ev . for a tight - binding model , we use @xmath114 , @xmath15= 1 ev , @xmath115 nm , and normalized electron density @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the electron density of filled bands and @xmath118 (= 2.2 @xmath119 10@xmath120 m@xmath121 ) is the maximum electron density . for a free - electron model ,",
    "the results for @xmath108 are excluded because it is singular . for a tight - binding model , the results for -0.28 ev@xmath122 nm @xmath123 -0.08 ev@xmath122 nm",
    "are not included because of bad convergence . ]",
    "we next show the angular dependence of @xmath17 and @xmath7 for the two models .",
    "here we do not attempt to analyze the detailed angular dependence quantitatively , because it is very parameter sensitive .",
    "in contrast , our intention is to identify the general trends that emerge from these numerical calculations .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the angular dependence of @xmath6 for a free - electron model ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) and a tight - binding model ( ( c ) and ( d ) ) . in both models , we obtain nontrivial angular dependence of @xmath6 in certain parameter regimes . in the free - electron model , we find @xmath6 is almost constant in weak ( @xmath124 ) and strong ( @xmath12 ) rashba regimes , consistent with earlier works.@xcite in the intermediate rashba regimes , however , @xmath6 is not a constant .",
    "we find that @xmath6 depends not only on the polar angle @xmath106 but also the azimuthal angle @xmath107 , as expected from the fermi surface distortion ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , @xmath6 for @xmath125 ( @xmath109 ) is maximal ( minimal ) at @xmath126 , which is caused by the anticrossing of the two fermi surfaces ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](d)-(f ) ) .",
    "despite the strong angular dependence , the sign of @xmath6 is preserved since the spin direction of nonequilibrium spin density is unambiguously determined once the direction of electric field and the sign of @xmath13 are fixed .",
    "these overall trends are qualitatively reproduced in a tight - binding model ( fig . [ fig2](c ) and ( d ) ) .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the angular dependence of @xmath7 for a free - electron model ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) and a tight - binding model ( ( c ) and ( d ) ) .",

    "[ fig3](a ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath6 which exhibits nontrivial angular dependence only in the intermediate rashba regime . to understand this difference",

    "( [ eq : sdfem2 ] ) with these assumptions , we find @xmath129 .",

    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which are obtained numerically , include the fermi surface distortion , so that the nontrivial angular dependence of @xmath7 results from the combined effects of the intrinsic fermi sea contribution and the fermi surface distortion .",

    "friedel oscillations form near surfaces when electrons reflect and the incoming and outgoing waves interfere .",
    "then , each electron below the fermi energy makes an oscillatory contribution to the density with a wavelength that depends on the energy .",
    "however , integrating up from the bottom of the band to the fermi energy gives a result that only depends on the properties of the electrons at the fermi energy where there is a sharp cut - off in the integration .",
    "we use simple models to examine the angular dependence of spin - orbit torques as a function of the ratio of the spin - orbit interaction to the exchange interaction .",
    "we find that both the field - like and damping - like torques are angle independent when the spin - orbit coupling is weak but become angle - dependent when the spin - orbit coupling becomes comparable to the exchange coupling .",
    "when the spin - orbit coupling becomes much stronger than the exchange coupling , the angular dependence of the field - like torque goes away , but that of the damping - like torque remains .",
    "the angular dependence of the field - like torque becomes significant when the spin - orbit coupling becomes strong enough to distort the fermi surface so that it changes when the direction of the magnetization changes . on the other hand ,",
    "the angular dependence of the damping - like torque is caused by the combined effects of the intrinsic fermi sea contribution and the fermi surface distortion .",
    "we expect that these qualitative conclusions will hold for more realistic treatments of the interface .",
    "the strong angular dependence of the spin - orbit torques will significantly impact their role in large amplitude magnetization dynamics like switching or domain wall motion .",
    "this suggests caution when comparing measurement of the strength of torques with the magnetizations in different directions .",
