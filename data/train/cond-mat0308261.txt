    "ferrofluids are composed of small single - domain magnetic particles dissolved in a liquid carrier . with no external magnetic field , brownian motion keeps the particles homogeneously distributed throughout the liquid . when a sample of ferrofluid is confined between two glass plates with a separation @xmath0 , and an external magnetic field @xmath1",
    "is applied normal to the plates , the particles aggregate .",
    "these aggregates are of approximately uniform size , and the separation of the aggregates is periodic with an average spacing @xmath2 .",
    "a view normal to the plates displays a hexagonal pattern of aggregates @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a new model for predicting the aggregate spacing , and compare the results of this model to experiment .",
    "we demonstrate that this model shows good agreement with experimental data for the aggregate spacing as a function of field @xmath1 and plate separation @xmath0 .",
    "we compare our results to experimental data from refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the model also yields the scaling behavior of the aggregate spacing @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in 1994 , wang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that there was a crossover in the exponent for @xmath2 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "they attributed this crossover to an experimentally observed structural change in the aggregates . in 1995 , liu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite also showed a crossover in this exponent for ferrofluid emulsions , but no explanation for the crossover was provided . in our model , this crossover takes place , and is not attributed to the mechanism in ref .",
    "we also report , for the first time , a crossover in the scaling behavior for @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the mechanisms responsible for both crossovers in our model are identified and discussed .",
    "experiments show that , when the field is first turned on , the particles form single - particle - diameter chains ; the system then evolves by the chains sticking together to form aggregates .",
    "the time scale associated with the chain formation is much smaller than the time scale observed for the formation of aggregates from chains @xcite . due to this observation",
    ", we treat the formation of the aggregates as a quasiequilibrium process .",
    "other examples of this treatment can be seen in refs.@xcite . with this assumption",
    ", the separation of the aggregates can be determined by minimizing the helmholtz free energy for the ferrofluid system .",
    "there are three contributions to the helmholtz free energy that must be considered : the magnetic energy , the entropy and the surface energy .",
    "for the purpose of notational simplicity , we introduce the constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 , such that @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total number of aggregates in the system . here , @xmath8 is the aggregate radius , @xmath9 is the volume fraction of the ferrofluid , @xmath10 is the packing fraction of the particles in an aggregate and @xmath11 is the area of one glass plate",
    ". these relationships are purely geometric , using the assumption that the aggregates are of uniform size and spacing .",
    "the magnetic energy contains three parts corresponding to the self - energy of the aggregates , the aggregate - aggregate interactions , and the aggregate - external field interactions .",
    "the model approximates the aggregates as cylinders that are uniformly magnetized .",
    "the approximation of cylindrical aggregates is consistent with the experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that a few particles away from the end of the aggregate the shape was cylindrical . since we are dealing with @xmath12 m and @xmath13 nm , the length of an aggregate is on the order of a thousand particles .",
    "given these experimental features , the approximation of cylindrical aggregates is a good one .    the approximation that the magnetization is uniform throughout the aggregates is reasonable . near the ends of the aggregates",
    "one would expect the average magnetic moment of the particles to be different than that of the bulk .",
    "however , the magnetization of the aggregates is determined mainly by the particles in the bulk . a correction for surface effects",
    "is included in the surface energy , discussed below .",
    "the uniform magnetization approximation has also been used in refs .",
    "@xcite .    from magnetostatics we know that the effective surface and volume charge densities are @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , where @xmath16 is the unit outward normal , and @xmath17 represents the magnetization of an aggregate . for the case of uniform magnetization parallel to the external magnetic field , @xmath18 on the top and bottom of the aggregates , @xmath19 on the sides and @xmath20 everywhere .",
    "thus , the total magnetic energy of the system can be calculated as interactions between disks of uniform equivalent charge density @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite    for the first contribution to the magnetic energy we consider the energy required to accumulate a single disk of equivalent charge .",
    "this self - energy of the disk can be calculated exactly in the following simple way .",
    "consider a disk of radius @xmath21 and uniform charge density @xmath22 .",
    "the potential at a point on the rim of the disk is @xmath23 now bring in a ring of uniform charge density @xmath22 , radius @xmath24 and thickness @xmath25 . the additional self - energy of the disk when the ring is added is @xmath26 integrating from @xmath27 to @xmath28 yields the total self - energy of one disk , @xmath29 to obtain the self - energy for all of the disks in the system",
    ", we must multiply this expression by @xmath30 and use the fact that @xmath18 .",
    "the factor of two is due to the fact that each aggregate is replaced by two disks of equivalent charge , so there are two layers of @xmath7 disks to consider .",
    "the final expression for the self - energy of the system is then @xmath31 this energy partially captures the particle - particle interactions within an aggregate .",
    "an additional contribution to the single aggregate energy arises from the interaction between the pair of disks associated with the same aggregate , as discussed below .    for the other contributions to the magnetic energy ,",
    "the disks can be treated as point charges .",
    "this approximation is valid since the aggregate spacing and length are large when compared to the aggregate diameter ( i.e.  @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "the condition that @xmath32 is satisfied by having a low volume fraction @xmath9 .",
    "( the experiments used for comparison with our model are done for @xmath34 . ) to satisfy the second condition , we use experimental observations which indicate that larger values of @xmath0 produce a smaller @xmath35 ratio .",
    "once the energetically favorable radii have been determined by minimizing the free energy , points where @xmath36 are considered accurate and other data points where @xmath37 are discarded .",
    "using the point charge approximation , the aggregates behave as dipoles , and the interaction energy of the aggregates with the external magnetic field is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the magnetic moment of an aggregate .",
    "this term does not depend on @xmath2 , and therefore will be considered a constant in the minimization process .",
    "the last contribution to the magnetic energy is due to the interactions between the disks . we must account for interactions between disks in the same plane ( @xmath40 ) and disks in opposite planes . for the interaction of the disks on opposite planes ,",
    "two terms must be included .",
    "one is the interaction of disks due to the same aggregate ( @xmath41 , i.e.  one disk directly over the other disk ) , and the other is the interaction of disks positioned diagonally to each other ( @xmath42 ) . using the point charge approximation , as previously mentioned , the total disk interaction energy will be @xmath43 it should be noted that @xmath41 arises from particle - particle interactions in a single aggregate , while @xmath40 and @xmath42 arise from the interaction between two separate aggregates .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , hong and collaborators found that the magnetization of their ferrofluid sample was well approximated by to the langevin function . since this functional form for the magnetization is also in agreement with refs.@xcite , and for small @xmath9 in ref.@xcite , we have used it for our model . combining these contributions yields a total magnetic energy of @xmath44\\alpha\\pi^2m^2+{\\rm const } ,    \\label{eq : mage}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 here",
    ", @xmath46 is the magnetic moment of the particles in the ferrofluid and @xmath47 is the saturation magnetization of the fluid . in the case of a ferrofluid emulsion",
    ", each drop has a magnetization described by the langevin function . in this case , the magnetization of an aggregate is still given by eq .",

    "performing an expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mage ] ) in powers of @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 ) , and keeping up to quadratic terms , this magnetic energy reduces to the one used in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , one should note that the assumption @xmath50 is a much stronger assumption than @xmath51 .",
    "for very small volume fractions , one can have the situation where @xmath52 with the condition @xmath51 easily satisfied , since @xmath4 increases as the volume fraction decreases .",
    "this magnetic energy offers a significant advantage over the model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , due to the elimination of all free parameters in the magnetic energy . with no free parameters in the magnetic energy",
    ", we can compare the orders of magnitude of the magnetic energy and entropy , as discussed in the next section .      to calculate the entropy we treat the aggregates as distinguishable .",
    "the number of states accessible to the system is @xmath53 , and the configurational entropy of the system is @xmath54 . for the experimental systems",
    "that we are modelling , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is taken to be room temperature .",
    "thus , the entropy is negligible for this particular set of experimental conditions .",
    "the last contribution to the energy to be considered is the surface energy .",
    "we have already accounted for particle - particle interactions in the bulk in calculating the magnetic energy .",
    "the surface energy allows us to include interactions on the surface of the aggregates , such as those between the surfactant and the solvent .    assuming a surface tension that is constant over the surface of the aggregate ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the surface energy of the system can be calculated as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the surface tension of the sides of the aggregate , and the surface energy due to the ends of the aggregate is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "there are several ways of dealing with the surface tension ( see for example refs.@xcite ) .",
    "we tried each surface tension and found that our results were closest to experiment using the surface energy found experimentally in ref .",
    "here it was determined that the surface tension goes as @xmath59 .",
    "since the surface tension includes interactions between the particles on the surface of the aggregate , we would expect the surface tension to saturate at large field values . to build this saturation into our model",
    "we assume that the surface energy goes as @xmath60 .",
    "the final form of the surface energy is then @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a constant determining the magnitude of the surface tension .      combining these contributions ,",
    "the helmholtz free energy of the ferrofluid system is given by @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mage ] ) and ( [ eq : surfe ] ) respectively . factoring out common terms and writing the magnetization in terms of @xmath4",
    "we obtain @xmath66\\alpha\\pi^2m_s^2+{\\rm const } ,    \\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 we minimize this free energy with respect to @xmath2 numerically using mathematica 4.0 .",
    "the values of @xmath4 , l , and @xmath3 are fixed by the experimental conditions , so @xmath68 is the only free parameter in the model .",
    "the value of @xmath47 is used only to calculate other quantities such as @xmath46 and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath4 can also be varied slightly , but only within reasonable limits established by the value of @xmath9 which is given for each experiment .",
    "this free energy can be compared to the theoretical models in refs .",
    "our new model differs from these previous models in three significant ways .",
    "first , this model has only one free parameter .",
    "all other parameters are specified by experimental conditions ; even this parameter could be determined by experiment .",
    "the second difference is our treatment of the surface energy using the results of ref .",
    "thirdly , this model permits direct comparison between the magnitudes of the magnetic energy and entropy .",
    "for the figures below , all parameter values except @xmath68 are assigned according to the experimental conditions .",
    "then @xmath68 is chosen so that the theoretical results give the best fit to the experimental data .",
    "for all of the sets of data , @xmath69 k and @xmath70 erg / oe ( @xmath7110 nm magnetite particles ) . for hong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite the parameter values are : @xmath72 ( calculated from @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , and @xmath75 . for wang",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite the parameter values are : @xmath76 ( calculated from @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) , and @xmath79 . as a point of interest , due to the fact that the surface tension includes the interaction of the particles at the surface of an aggregate , one might expect the surface tension of an aggregate in a ferrofluid emulsion to be much smaller than that of an aggregate in a ferrofluid .",
    "using our parameters , we obtain @xmath80 for the ferrofluid emulsion in ref .  @xcite and @xmath81 for the ferrofluid in refs .",
    "@xcite , confirming this expectation .",
    "we first compare our model to the experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite , where experimental data was recorded for @xmath2 as a function of @xmath0 for fixed @xmath82 oe .",
    "they report an exponent of 0.47 , changing to an exponent of 0.67 at @xmath83 m . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wang94 ] , the results of our model are shown as diamonds , squares and triangles for three different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the solid lines are power law fits of our numerical results . although , we predict lower exponents than the data suggests , the crossover in the exponent is present .",
    "we have included results for three values of @xmath1 to show the effect of changing @xmath1 in our model .",
    "it is clear that increasing the field produces three significant effects : decreasing the critical value of @xmath0 where the crossover takes place , increasing the value of both exponents , and decreasing the difference between the exponents .",
    "it is our hope that these effects will be probed experimentally",
    ".    a closer look at our model reveals the mechanism responsible for the crossover . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the crossover in the exponent was thought to be the result of a structural change in the aggregates for increasing @xmath0 . in their experiment , as @xmath0 is increased , the aggregates begin to lose their circular cross sections , forming branching structures between aggregates .",
    "a theoretical model was developed to account for these branched structures , predicting a larger exponent as the branching occurs .",
    "we have obtained a crossover in the exponent assuming cylindrically shaped aggregates with no structural changes , and thus the crossover in our model can not be attributed to the mechanism in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "examination of eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) for @xmath84 provides a mechanism for the crossover . in this limit",
    ", the free energy reduces to the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are constants with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "this form of the free energy predicts that @xmath88 . when @xmath52 the exponent will be less than 0.5 , with the exponent depending upon the value of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the mechanism for the crossover in our model is a competition between terms in the magnetic energy .",
    "for @xmath84 , the magnetic energy is dominated by the self - energy of the disks and the energy due to disks in the same plane .",
    "as @xmath0 is reduced , the contributions due to the disks in opposite planes become more important , until at some critical value of @xmath0 , they can no longer be ignored , lowering the value of the exponent .    fig .",
    "[ fig : hong97 ] shows the aggregate spacing as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the crosses represent the experimental data for @xmath89 m obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite , and the diamonds , squares and triangles represent the numerical results for three different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the solid lines are power law fits to our results .",
    "more experimental data points would prove beneficial in testing the theory in this case ; however the theory agrees very well with this experimental data .",
    "[ fig : hong97 ] shows that our model predicts a crossover in the exponent for @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this is the first time such a prediction has been reported in the literature .",
    "three values of @xmath0 are shown to demonstrate another prediction ; the critical value of @xmath1 where the crossover occurs , and the value of the exponents , have essentially no dependence on @xmath0 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : hong97 ] , it is clear that , for large @xmath0 , the crossover in the exponent for @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 occurs with approximately the same exponents as for small @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , to understand the mechanism responsible for this crossover , it is beneficial to look again at eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) in the limit of @xmath84 . in this limit , @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are constants with respect to @xmath93 and @xmath2 .",
    "this predicts that @xmath94 .",
    "thus , for small @xmath95 , the aggregate spacing goes as @xmath96 , and for large @xmath95 the magnetization saturates and the aggregate spacing does not depend upon @xmath1 .",
    "for the results presented in fig.[fig : hong97 ] , this saturation occurs @xmath97 2000 oe .",
    "since the magnetization of an aggregate is proportional to the langevin function , it is clear that a change in the magnetic moment of the particles in the ferrofluid changes the value of the field where the crossover takes place .",
    "thus , the mechanism for the crossover in the exponent for @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 in our model is the field dependence of the magnetization of the aggregates .",
    "this is a direct result of the form chosen for the field dependence of the surface and magnetic energies in our model , so experimental studies of this crossover could be used to determine the appropriateness of these field dependencies .",
    "we have shown that aggregate spacing can be determined by minimization of the helmholtz free energy . we have developed a simple model and compared its predictions to experiments in refs .",
    "our model predicts trends as a function of external field strength and plate separation .",
    "the results of our model are in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the scaling behavior of the aggregate spacing as a function of plate separation and external field is discussed . for aggregate",
    "spacing as a function of plate separation , there is a predicted crossover in the value of the exponent at some critical plate separation .",
    "this feature of our model is in agreement with refs.@xcite , where similar results were reported .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this crossover in our model is a competition between terms in the magnetic energy .",
    "our model also predicts a crossover in the exponent as a function of external field .",
    "this has not been reported in the literature to date .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this crossover in our model is the field dependence of the magnetization of the aggregates .",
    "different forms of the magnetization , surface energy or magnetic energy would change this behavior . this result suggests that experiments measuring this crossover could be used to probe the forms of these quantities .    c.  -y .",
