    "mumford @xcite addressed that    _  stochastic differential equations are more fundamental and relevant to modeling the world than deterministic equations @xmath7 .",
    "a major step in making the equation more relevant is to add a small stochastic term .",
    "even if the size of the stochastic term goes to 0 , its asymptotic effects need not .",
    "it seems fair to say that all differential equations are better models of the world when a stochastic term is added and that their classical analysis is useful only if it is stable in an appropriate sense to such perturbations \" .",
    "_ this shows that it is important to check the asymptotic stability of stochastic systems with small noise . for this purpose ,",
    "a basic method is to study the stationary measures and their limit measures .",
    "the latters are called zero - noise limits by young @xcite and cowieson and young @xcite , where they proved srb measures can be realized as zero - noise limits .",
    "huang , ji , liu and yi @xcite have investigated stochastic ordinary differential equations with small white noise where the drift vector field is dissipative .",
    "they have shown that limiting measures are invariant for the flow generated by the drift vector field and their supports are in its global attractor . for non - degenerate noise , freidlin and",
    "wentzell @xcite estimated the concentration of limiting measure for stationary measures via the large - deviation technique and proved that the stationary measure value @xmath8 tends to zero for any subset @xmath9 not intersecting with any attractor for the drift vector field , which implies that any limiting measure will support on the global attractor of the drift vector field ; li and yi @xcite have presented more precise estimation for stationary measures near the global attractor or outside of the global attractor via the fokker - planck equation and the level set method developed in @xcite , which are applied by them to study systematic measures of biological network including degeneracy , complexity , and robustness .",
    "hwang @xcite proved limiting probability measure of gibbs measures for gradient system with additive noise concentrates on the minimal energy states .",
    "huang , ji , liu and yi @xcite have explored the stochastic stability of invariant sets and measures for gradient systems with noises .",
    "this paper is intended to establish the close connection between deterministic dynamical systems and their stochastic perturbations by considering the limiting behavior of stationary measures for stochastic evolution systems with small random perturbations .",
    "these stochastic evolution systems @xmath10 may be solutions of various stochastic differential equations driven by white or lvy noise with the intensity @xmath0 . the corresponding solution of deterministic equations is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath1 be the stationary probability measure of @xmath10 .",
    "we prove that all their limits of stationary measures @xmath1 of @xmath2 are @xmath5invariant and their supports are contained in the birkhoff center of @xmath6 as @xmath0 tends to zero ( see theorem [ mthm ] ) . for various stochastic differential equations with small noise intensity , we prove the probability convergence property and provide the existence of stationary measures and their tightness and applications to all corresponding stochastic systems ( see sections 3 - 5 ) .",
    "usually , a global attractor for finite dimensional system has positive lebesgue measure if it is not a globally stable equilibrium , however , the birkhoff center always has zero lebesgue measure for dissipative system .",
    "compared to the existing results , which mostly focus on sodes with non - degenerate noise , ours gives much more precise positions for limiting measures to support .",
    "we note that our result is the best if we do nt put any restriction to types of noise because we can construct a diffusion term such that a sequence of stationary measures weakly converges to a given invariant measure of the drift vector field ( see proposition [ procons ] and remark [ re8 ] ) .",
    "as far as we know , among all existing examples ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the limiting measures support at stable orbits , such as , stable equilibrium or closed orbits .",
    "a natural question arises : when a dissipative drift vector field has no stable motion in its global attractor , where does any limiting measure support ? utilizing our result , we construct bernoulli s lemniscate with non - degenerate noise such that stationary measures weakly converge to a delta measure at a saddle of the drift vector field , however , the global attractor in this case is the closed domain surrounded by the lemniscate of bernoulli ( see example 3 ) . in may - leonard system",
    "perturbed by a one dimensional white noise ( see example 4 ) , we have proved that the limiting measures will support at the three saddles when the deterministic may - leonard system admits a heteroclinic cycle .",
    "also , from this example , the limiting measures can be distinguished by different initial values because of the various kinds of asymptotic behavior for deterministic equations . in a word",
    ", limiting measures always support at  most relatively stable positions \" .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the framework to study the limiting measures of stationary measures for stochastic evolution processes and their supports . from sections 35 ,",
    "we prove the probability convergence , the existence of stationary measures and their tightness for various stochastic differential equations .",
    "specially , in section 3 , we deal with all these problems of stochastic ordinary differential equations ( sodes ) . in section 4 , we investigate stochastic reaction - diffusion equations , stochastic @xmath12 navier - stokes equations and stochastic burgers type equations driven by brownian motions or lvy process . in sections 5",
