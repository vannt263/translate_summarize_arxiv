    "the construction of statistical mechanics applicable to non - equilibrium systems has been attempted for a long time . however , even in non - equilibrium steady states , no general framework is known , except for the linear response theory @xcite .",
    "for example , a useful form of the steady state distribution function has not been determined in systems far from equilibrium .    in order to consider a strategy for investigating the statistical mechanics of non - equilibrium steady states ,",
    "let us recall the justification of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the equilibrium statistical mechanics leads to einstein s formula on macroscopic fluctuations , which relates a large deviation functional of macroscopic fluctuations with a thermodynamic function .",
    "since the validity of this formula can be checked by measuring the fluctuations of macroscopic quantities , we expect that its examination in non - equilibrium steady states might provide a hint to develop non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .    with regard to the large deviation functionals in non - equilibrium steady states , we review a few works .",
    "first , a large deviation functional of density fluctuations is exactly derived for non - equilibrium lattice gases @xcite .",
    "this functional is nonlocal in contrast to equilibrium cases , and the local part takes the same form as the equilibrium form .",
    "the latter property seems to be specific to the model , which is sufficiently simple to solve .",
    "indeed , the local part of the density fluctuations in a driven lattice gas is strongly influenced by an externally driven force @xcite .",
    "however , even in this case , it has been numerically shown that the local part can be described by an extended , operationally constructed thermodynamic function @xcite .",
    "this result has been proved mathematically for some systems under a special condition @xcite .    in this paper , in order to check the generality of the result in refs . @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we study a model of interacting brownian particles under non - equilibrium conditions . here , note that the motion of brownian particles is believed to be described by langevin equations .",
    "this has been confirmed experimentally by measuring the trajectories of brownian particles with a high accuracy , which might have become possible by the recent development of technology for optical instruments @xcite . from this fact ,",
    "the system of brownian particles is regarded as an ideal system for studying the fundamental problems of statistical mechanics , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model : num ] , we introduce langevin equations describing the motion of many brownian particles under an external driving force .",
    "we also define the correlation coefficient @xmath0 and the response coefficient @xmath1 that we study . after reviewing briefly ,",
    "the equality between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( called a fluctuation - response relation ) , we conjecture in sec . [ conjecture : num ] that the fluctuation response relation can be extended to non - equilibrium systems on the basis of the consideration of einstein s formula on macroscopic fluctuations . in sec .",
    "[ sokutei ] , we report a result of numerical experiments .",
    "the final section is devoted to a few remarks .",
    "we study the system that consists of @xmath2 brownian particles suspended in a two dimensional solvent of temperature @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 , @xmath5 , be the position of the @xmath6-th particle , where @xmath7\\times[0,l]$ ] with a periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we express the @xmath8-th component of @xmath4 as @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "that is , @xmath11 .",
    "each particle is driven by an external force @xmath12 and is subject to a periodic potential @xmath13 with period @xmath14 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the periodic potential is independent of @xmath15 . furthermore , we express the interaction between the @xmath6-th and @xmath16-th particles by an interaction potential @xmath17 .    the motion of the @xmath6-th brownian particle is assumed to be described by a langevin equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a friction constant and @xmath20 is zero - mean gaussian white noise that satisfies @xmath21 here , the boltzmann constant is set to unity .",
    "the @xmath6-th and @xmath16-th particles interact via the soft core repulsive potential @xmath22 given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cutoff radius of the potential .",
    "we also assume a form of the periodic potential @xmath13 as @xmath25    it should be noted that without the periodic potential @xmath13 , the system is equivalent to an equilibrium system in a moving frame with velocity @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the periodic potential is necessary for investigating the non - equilibrium nature . in the case",
    "that @xmath27 , the langevin equation given in eq .",
    "( [ lange1 ] ) satisfies the detailed balance condition with respect to the canonical distribution ; consequently , the stationary distribution is canonical . on the contrary , in the non - equilibrium cases where @xmath28 , the stationary distribution is not the canonical distribution because of the lack of the detailed balance condition .    in this paper",
    ", all quantities are converted to dimensionless forms by setting @xmath19 , @xmath14 , and @xmath3 to unity .",
    "the values of the parameters in our model are chosen as follows .",
    "first , @xmath29 , that is , the interaction range of the particle is comparable in size to the period of the periodic potential .",
    "second , in the soft - core repulsive interaction @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ interaction : simulation ] ) , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "third , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and finally @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , eq . is solved numerically by using an explicit time integration method with the time step @xmath36 .    with these parameters ,",
    "we first perform preliminary measurements so as to check how far the system is from the equilibrium .",
    "concretely , we measure the current @xmath37 as a function of an external force @xmath38 , where we calculate @xmath37 numerically as @xmath39 here , we choose the values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 so that the right - hand side becomes independent of these values within the numerical accuracy we imposed .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ current15 ] , by which we judge that the system with @xmath42 is in a state far from the linear - response regime .",
    "thus , in the argument below , we investigate the system with @xmath42 as an example of non - equilibrium systems .     in the @xmath43 direction as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "the average values of @xmath37 for 10 samples are plotted for several values of @xmath38 .",

    "@xmath0 is related to a response coefficient against a potential perturbation . in the present problem",

    "is meant @xmath55 although it should hold in equilibrium cases , there is no reason to expect that it also holds in non - equilibrium systems .",
    "nevertheless , we can measure both @xmath0 and @xmath1 even for non - equilibrium systems .",
    "thus , we can check the relation concretely by numerical experiments .",
    "before presenting the results of numerical experiments , we review the understanding of the relation given in eq .",
    "( [ frr ] ) . in equilibrium cases",
    ", the relation can be directly obtained from the canonical distribution ; however , here we present an alternative , phenomenological understanding based on a macroscopic fluctuation theory in order to consider an extension of the relation .",
    "let @xmath56 be a fluctuating density field defined at a macroscopic scale .",
    "then , due to the large deviation property , the stationary distribution is written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is called a large deviation functional . according to the fluctuation theory for systems under equilibrium conditions , @xmath59 is determined by thermodynamics . concretely , using a free energy density @xmath60 , we can write @xmath61 , \\label{einstein2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the average density . this relation is called einstein s formula and can be proved within a framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics . noting that @xmath63 is an example of macroscopic density fluctuations , we find that eq .",
    "( [ frr ] ) is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ ld ] ) and ( [ einstein2 ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ ld ] ) and ( [ einstein2 ] ) are so simple that they are expected to be extended to those valid in non - equilibrium systems . more concretely , we conjecture that eq .",
    "( [ einstein2 ] ) holds if the free energy is extended in a consistent manner .    in this conjecture ,",
    "the existence of the extended free energy is highly nontrivial . indeed ,",
    "severe restrictions are required to construct thermodynamics in non - equilibrium steady states , as discussed in ref .",
    "nevertheless , we already know that thermodynamics can be extended in non - equilibrium states for driven lattice gases when we focus on the transversal direction to the driving force @xcite .",
    "since the present model has common features with driven lattice gases , we expect that the thermodynamics can be extended to our model in a manner similar to that for driven lattice gases .",
    "these considerations lead us to conjecture the validity of eq .",
    "( [ frr ] ) , although the statistical distribution is not canonical in non - equilibrium cases .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ frr ] ) can be checked independently of the question whether or not thermodynamic functions can be extended to non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "before measuring @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we estimate the relaxation time @xmath64 for the density field .",
    "this estimation is necessary for the accurate determination of statistical averages by numerical experiments .",
    "since perturbation effects of the potential @xmath65 can be neglected , we estimate @xmath64 only for the systems without this potential . initially",
    ", we prepare an inhomogeneous particle configuration ; as an example , all particles are placed on the sites of a hexagonal lattice with the lattice interval @xmath66 .",
    "then , we observe a diffusion phenomenon of the density field by solving eq .",
    "( [ lange1 ] ) numerically . because we found that the diffusion in the @xmath43 direction is slower than that in the @xmath15 direction , we measure only the time dependence of @xmath67 . repeating this procedure @xmath68 times",
    ", we estimate the statistical average of @xmath69 .",
    "we then obtain a fitting @xmath70 .",
    "we found that the @xmath71 dependence of @xmath64 is small and that @xmath64 is a decreasing function of @xmath38 when the other parameters are fixed . from these observations , we estimate @xmath64 for the system with @xmath72 , @xmath71 , and @xmath38 by measuring @xmath64 for the system with @xmath27 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .    using @xmath64 evaluated above , we estimate a statistical average @xmath75 using a time average @xmath76 where we chose the values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 as those more than 40 times of the relaxation time @xmath64 for the density field .",
    "we now measure @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ def : r ] ) for all the values of @xmath72 and @xmath71 ( mentioned previously ) both under the equilibrium condition @xmath27 and the non - equilibrium condition @xmath42 . by measuring @xmath79{\\right\\rangle}_\\epsilon$ ] for several values of @xmath80 , we estimate the regime where it linearly depends on @xmath80 . the slope in this region yields @xmath1 .",

    "we find that for @xmath42 , the value of @xmath0 shows clear deviation from the equilibrium value .",
    "this suggests that the stationary distribution of @xmath86 in the non - equilibrium case is not close to the equilibrium distribution .    from the two independent measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath0",

    "two same symbols correspond to the data obtained by using the same @xmath72 and @xmath71 for the equilibrium and non - equilibrium conditions . ]    here , we present a remark on the systematic deviation from the equality in fig [ graph : frr ] .",
    "let us recall that the validity of the equality given in eq .",
    "( [ frr ] ) can be proved mathematically in equilibrium cases .",
    "therefore , each point in fig .",
    "[ graph : frr ] should exist on the solid line within the statistical error bar at least for the equilibrium cases .",
    "we conjecture that the slight but systematic deviation from the solid line in fig .",
    "[ graph : frr ] is caused by numerical inaccuracy associated with a choice of the value of @xmath90 . in order to check it further",
    ", we measured how the deviation depends on the time step @xmath90 in our numerical calculation .",
    "as shown in fig [ graph : error ] , @xmath91 approaches 1 in the limit @xmath92 .",
    "thus , we expect that in both equilibrium and non - equilibrium cases , the fluctuation - response relation holds with a higher accuracy if we perform numerical experiments with a smaller @xmath90 .     as a function of the time step @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath73 . ]",
    "before concluding this paper , we present two remarks . first , let us notice that the system we study is a typical example of the so - called _ driven diffusive system _ @xcite .",
    "it has been believed that in such a system the equal - time spatial correlation function generally exhibits a power - law decay of the type @xmath93 for a large distance @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the spatial dimension of the system @xcite .",
    "this power - low decay is called the long - range correlation .",
    "in fact , it has been proved for the model given in eq .",
    "( [ lange1 ] ) that this type of long - range correlation appears when the interaction length between two particles is sufficiently larger than the period @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , such a nonlocal behavior of density fluctuations was not observed in our numerical experiments . a plausible explanation for this apparent inconsistency might be that the system size we study is much smaller than that at which the long - range correlation can be observed , though the system size is so large that thermodynamic fluctuations can be argued .",
    "further studies will be necessary in order to gain a clearer understanding .",
    "as the second remark , we address an example of laboratory experimental systems related to our study and consider the possibility of observing our simulation results experimentally .",
    "first , since a periodic potential with a period of @xmath96 @xmath97 m can be designed by using an optical instrument @xcite , let us assume that @xmath98 corresponds to @xmath99 m .",
    "then @xmath29 and @xmath34 correspond to @xmath100 @xmath97 m and @xmath101 @xmath97 m , respectively . here , the cutoff radius @xmath24 may be interpreted as an interaction range such as the debye screening length of the screened coulomb potential . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , such a long screening length can be realized experimentally .",
    "note that the core radius of the particle is of the order of micrometers .",
    "next , in order to realize the periodic boundary conditions in the direction of the external force , it might be a good method to place all the particles under a rotating optical tweezer with a velocity @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "indeed , by observing the system in the moving frame @xmath102 , we can confirm that the spatially homogeneous force @xmath103 is produced with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ periodic_bc ] . )",
    "we expect that such an implementation is possible due to the recent development of the optical technology @xcite .        in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated that the fluctuation - response relation given in eq .",
    "( [ frr ] ) is plausible for many brownian particles under an external driving force when we focus on a direction transversal to the driving force .",
    "if this relation is valid for any average density , one can obtain a formula that relates the intensity of density fluctuations in the transversal direction to the derivative of a chemical potential with respect to the density @xcite .",
    "then , by measuring the work required to change the system size in the transversal direction , one may confirm the maxwell relation , which ensures the existence of a thermodynamic function extended to non - equilibrium steady states @xcite . in this manner ,",
