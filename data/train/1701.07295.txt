    "one approach is to apply the standard notion of independence to every element of some set of probability measures .",
    "the alternative , called epistemic independence , is to define independence as mutual irrelevance , in the sense that receiving information about one of the variables will not effect our uncertainty model for the other .",

    "when an assessment of epistemic independence is combined with local uncertainty models , it leads to a unique corresponding joint uncertainty model that is called the independent natural extension .",

    "though , this equivalence is highly important , because the williams - coherent conditional lower previsions that are considered in  @xcite are well - known to include as special cases a variety of other uncertainty models , including expectations , lower expectations , probabilities , lower probabilities and belief functions ; lower probabilities , for example , can be obtained by restricting the domain of @xmath66 to indicators . for that reason ,",

    "having introduced our main tools for modelling uncertainty , the next step towards developing a notion of independent natural extension is to agree on what we mean by independence . within the context of lower previsions , there are basically two main options .",
    "the first approach , which we will not consider here , is to interpret lower previsions as lower expectations , that is , as tight lower bounds on the expectations that correspond to some set of probability measures , and to then impose the usual notion of independence on each of the probability measures in that set .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being familiar , but is restricted in scope because it can only be applied to uncertainty models that are expressed in terms of probabilities .    the second approach , which is the one that we will adopt here , is to regard independence as an assessment of mutual irrelevance .",
    "in particular , we say that @xmath100 and @xmath101 are independent if our uncertainty model for @xmath100 is not affected by conditioning on information about @xmath101 , and vice versa .",
    "this definition can easily be applied to a probability measure , and then yields the usual notion of independence . however , and that is what makes this approach powerful and intuitive , it can just as easily be applied to lower previsions , sets of desirable gambles , or any other type of uncertainty model .",
    "this type of independence is usually referred to as epistemic independence .",
    "the aim of this section is to formalize this concept for the case of two variables , in terms of sets of desirable gambles and conditional lower previsions .",
    "consider two variables @xmath100 and @xmath101 where , for every @xmath102 , @xmath103 takes values @xmath104 in a non - empty set @xmath105 that may be uncountably infinite , and let @xmath106 be the corresponding joint variable that takes values @xmath107 in @xmath108 . in this context ,",

    "that being said , let us now recall our informal definition of epistemic independence , which was that the uncertainty model for @xmath100 is not affected by conditioning on information about @xmath101 , and vice versa . in the context of sets of desirable gambles , this can now be formalized as follows : @xmath134 the only thing that is left to specify are the conditioning events @xmath135 and @xmath136 for which we want this condition to hold .",
    "we think that the most intuitive approach is to impose this for every @xmath124 and @xmath125 , and will call this epistemic subset - independence . however , this is not what is usually done .",
    "the conventional approach , which we will refer to as epistemic value - independence , is to focus on singleton events of the type @xmath137 and @xmath138 ; see for example  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we believe this conventional approach to be flawed and will argue against it further on . until then",
    ", we postpone this debate by adopting a very general approach that subsumes the former two as special cases .",

    "our results so far can be regarded as a generalisation of the existence results of  @xcite .",
    "as we are about to show , his factorisation results can be generalised as well .",
    "when @xmath130 and @xmath133 are finite , the independent natural extension of two lower previsions @xmath167 and @xmath168 is well - known to satisfy the properties of factorisation and external additivity  @xcite .",
    "factorisation , on the one hand , states that @xmath183 where @xmath42 is a non - negative gamble on @xmath130 , @xmath184 is a gamble on @xmath133 and @xmath185 . by symmetry , the role of @xmath186 and @xmath187 can of course be reversed .",
    "external additivity , on the other hand , states that @xmath188 where @xmath64 and @xmath184 are gambles on @xmath130 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "compared to the properties that are satisfied by the joint expectation of a product measure of two precise probability measures , these notions of factorisation and external additivity are rather weak .",
    "for example , for a precise product measure , additivity is not ` external ' , in the sense that @xmath64 and @xmath184 do not have to be defined on separate variables , nor does factorisation require @xmath42 to be non - negative .",
    "nevertheless , even in this weaker form , these properties remain of crucial practical importance . for example , in the context of credal networks  bayesian networks whose local models are imprecise  they turned out to be the key to the development of efficient inference algorithms ; see for example  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "any notion of independent natural extension that aims to extend such algorithms to infinite spaces , therefore , should preserve some suitable version of equations   and  .",
    "the aim of this section is to study the extent to which these equations are satisfied by the notion of independent natural extension that was developed in this paper .",
    "as we will see , the answer ends up being surprisingly positive .",
    "for all @xmath102 , let @xmath165 be a coherent conditional lower prevision on @xmath166 , let @xmath189 be its natural extension to @xmath190 , and let @xmath180 be a subset of @xmath191 .",
    "the independent natural extension of @xmath167 and @xmath168 then satisfies the following three properties , the first of which implies the other two as special cases .",
    "[ theo : fact - add - measurable ] let @xmath144 .",
    "for any @xmath113 , @xmath192 and @xmath180-measurable @xmath193 , we then have that @xmath194    [ corol : fact - measurable ] let @xmath144 . for any @xmath192 and any @xmath193 that is @xmath180-measurable",
    ", we then have that @xmath195    [ corol : add ] for any @xmath196 and @xmath197 , we have that @xmath198    in each of these results , if the local domains @xmath171 and @xmath172 are sufficiently large  that is , if they include the gambles that appear in the statement of the results  it follows from proposition  [ prop : naturalextension : full ] that @xmath189 and @xmath199 can be replaced by @xmath165 and @xmath200 , respectively , and similarly for @xmath201 and @xmath202 . that being said ,",
    "let us now go back to the question of whether or not equations   and   can be generalised to the case of infinite spaces . for the case of external additivity , it clearly follows from corollary  [ corol : add ] that the answer is fully positive .",
    "furthermore , this conclusion holds regardless of our choice for @xmath177 and @xmath178 ; they can even be empty .",
    "for factorisation , the answer does depend on @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "if we adopt epistemic subset - independence  that is , if we choose @xmath203 and @xmath204it follows from corollaries  [ corol : measurable : sufficient : allsets ] and  [ corol : fact - measurable ] that the answer is again fully positive , because @xmath191-measurability then holds trivially .",
    "if @xmath205 and @xmath206 are sigma fields , the answer remains fairly positive as well , because proposition  [ prop : measurability : equivalenceforsigmafield ] then implies that it suffices for @xmath42 to be measurable in the usual , measure - theoretic sense .",
    "if we adopt epistemic value - independence  that is , if we choose @xmath207 and @xmath208it is necessary for @xmath42 to be @xmath105-measurable , which is a rather strong requirement that easily fails .",
    "for that reason , we think that for the case of infinite spaces , when it comes to choosing between epistemic value- and subset - independence , the latter should be preferred over the former .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that by combining williams - coherence with epistemic subset - independence , we obtain a notion of independent natural extension that always exists , and that furthermore satisfies factorisation and external additivity . for weaker types of epistemic independence , including epistemic value - irrelevance ,",
    "the existence result and the external additivity property remain valid , but factorisation then requires measurability conditions .",
    "we foresee several lines of future research .",
    "the first , which we expect to be rather straightforward , is to extend our results from the case of two variables to that of any finite number of variables .",
    "next , these extended versions of our results could then be used to develop efficient algorithms for credal networks whose variables take values in infinite spaces , by suitably adapting existing algorithms for the finite case . on the more technical side",
    ", it would be useful to see whether our results can be extended to the case of unbounded functions .",
    "finally , for variables that take values in euclidean space , @xmath177 and @xmath178 could be restricted to the lebesgue measurable events .",
    "combined with an assessment of continuity , we think that this could lead to the development of a notion of independent natural extension that includes sigma additive product measures as a special case .",
