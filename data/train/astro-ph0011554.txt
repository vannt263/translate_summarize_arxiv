    "this isotope , produced in different types of supernovae , has a lifetime of @xmath190 years and should therefore be a good tracer for young supernova remnants ( snrs ) . the observed @xmath3ray line flux and the relatively small angular dimensions of the remnant imply an age of only @xmath1680 years and a small distance of @xmath1200 pc ( aschenbach , iyudin & schnfelder 1999 ) .",

    "rays from the snr shell .",
    "the high absorption suggests that is at a distance of the order of @xmath11 - 2 kpc , well beyond the vela snr .",
    "consequently an age of several thousands year is more likely .",
    "these conclusions are also supported by the fact that a new analysis of the comptel data ( schnfelder et al .",

    "depending on the data selection and method of analysis , the excess is present at a level between @xmath12 and 4 @xmath7 : if is not emitting @xmath4ti @xmath3-rays there are no compelling reasons to require a particularly small distance and age .",

    "the position of the bright , softer source is consistent with that of the excess seen in the rosat soft x  ray ( @xmath142.4 kev ) data ( aschenbach 1998 ) and with that of the source detected with asca ( slane et al .",

    "the discrepancy is probably to be ascribed to a different evaluation of the ( highly uncertain ) background and of the contribution of the central source(s ) , as well as to uncertainties in the relative calibration of the two instruments for what concerns the response to regions of diffuse emission . in any case ,",
    "independent on the absolute luminosity of the diffuse emission , it is important to note that our results confirm its non - thermal origin .",
    "both and , located close to the geometrical center of the snr , are in principle good candidates to be the neutron star associated to . however , as shown in the following discussion , the interpretation of either source as a neutron star is problematic in two respects .",
