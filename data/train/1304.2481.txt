    "electrostatic interactions are easily adjusted through changes in the ph or salt concentration providing a convenient experimental means to manipulate the phase behavior . however , they are difficult to model theoretically due to the long range nature of the coulomb force and the nonlinearity of salt screening . because of this , most theoretical work on protein - protein interactions has focused on dilute solution properties where the electrostatic free energy is dominated by the coulomb energy and can be treated using two - body potentials @xcite .",
    "we have recently shown that the electrostatic free energy of protein association is dominated by the change in salt ion entropy , which renders the net interaction strongly non - pairwise @xcite . in this paper",
