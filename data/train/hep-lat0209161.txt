    "compact u(1 ) lattice gauge theory in three - dimensions is the most well - understood nontrivial gauge theory .",
    "the theory exhibits some important similarities with qcd @xcite , such as confinement @xcite and chiral symmetry breaking @xcite . because of its simplicity",
    ", it has been a good testing ground for new methods and algorithmic approaches . while the euclidean path integral monte carlo simulations @xcite have been very successful in the study of non - perturbative lattice gauge theories and",
    "is currently the preffered technique for studying qcd at low energies , there there has been some progress in the development of analytic and numerical approaches in the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the hamiltonian version of the model has been studied by many methods : some recent studies include series expansions @xcite , finite - lattice techniques@xcite , the t - expansion @xcite , and coupled - cluster techniques @xcite , as well as quantum monte carlo methods@xcite .",
    "quite accurate estimates have been obtained for the string tension and the mass gaps , which can be used as comparison for our present results .",
    "the finite - size scaling properties of the model can be predicted using an effective lagrangian approach combined with a weak - coupling expansion @xcite , and the predictions agree very well with finite - lattice data @xcite . here",
    "our aim is to use standard euclidean path integral monte carlo techniques for an anisotropic lattice , and see whether useful results can be obtained in the anisotropic or hamiltonian limit .",
    "the anisotropic wilson gauge action for compact u(1 ) model in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions has the form @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the spatial and temporal plaquette variables respectively . in the classical limit @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 in ( 2 + 1)d ) ) and @xmath7 is the anisotropy parameter , @xmath8 is the lattice spacing in the space direction , and",

    "antisymmetric mass gap is a fundamental quantity of interest in u(1 ) model . on an isotropic lattice",
    ", the model reduces to the simple continuum theory of non - interacting photons in the naive continuum limit at a fixed energy scale @xcite but if one renormalizes or rescales in the standard way so as to maintain the mass gap constant , then one obtains a confining theory of free massive bosons .",
    "g \" opfert and mack@xcite proved that in the continuum limit the theory converges to a scalar free field theory of massive bosons .",
    "they found that in that limit the mass gap behaves as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the coulomb potential at zero distance for the isotropic case .",
    "the behaviour of the mass gap in the anisotropic case will be similar to equation ( [ eqn5 ] ) generalizing discussions by banks _",
    "et al_@xcite and ben - menahem@xcite , we find that the exponential factor takes exactly the same form in the anisotropic case .",

    "the expected finite - size scaling behaviour of the mass gap near the continuum critical point in this model is not known ; but weigel and janke@xcite have performed a monte carlo simulation for an o(2 ) spin model in three dimensions which should lie in the same universality class , obtaining    @xmath16    for the magnetic gap .",
    "using the anisotropic wilson action , we perform monte carlo simulations on a finite lattice of size @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of lattice sites in the space direction and @xmath19 in the temporal direction , with spacing ratio @xmath20 . by varying @xmath21",
    "it is possible to change @xmath9 , while keeping the spacing in the spatial direction fixed .",
    "the details of the algorithm for updating are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the simulations were performed on lattices with @xmath22 sites in each of the two spatial directions and @xmath23 in the temporal direction for a range of couplings @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the estimates for the glueball masses of @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels against @xmath27 for the euclidean case @xmath28 .",
    "as expected the masses are seen to vanish exponentially with @xmath27 as we approach the continuum limit ( high @xmath27 ) . to show the evidence of scaling behaviour of antisymmetric glueball masses",
    ", we used the predicted asymptotic form , equation [ eqn5 ] , with an additional normalization constant ; @xmath29 where @xmath30 when adjusted to fit the data .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the predicted scaling behaviour . the solid line on the graph is a fit to the data over the range @xmath31 . the slope , @xmath32 , of the data matches the predicted asymptotic form very nicely , but the coefficient is too large by a factor of 5.2 .",
    "it would again be interesting to explore whether this discrepancy could be due to quantum corrections .",
    "the finite - size scaling behaviour is shown by the dashed line in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the euclidean mass gap should not be effected by finite - size corrections until @xmath33 .    to check the consistency of our method , we plot the dimensionless ratio of the the antisymmetric mass gap over the square root of the string tension against @xmath27 together with the results of teper @xcite in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "the solid line gives the ratio of the fits in figures [ fig2 ] and fig .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the behaviour of the glueball masses as function of @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "the extrapolation to the hamiltonian limit is performed by a simple cubic fit in powers of @xmath34 . in the limit @xmath11 , we reproduce the earlier series estimates of hamer et al@xcite for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 states .",
    "the estimates of the antisymmetric mass gap , for various @xmath27 , extracted from the extrapolation to the @xmath11 limit are graphed as a function of @xmath27 in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the solid line is a fit to the data for @xmath36 of the form ( [ eqn5 ] ) , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which is similar to the coefficient found in the euclidean case .",
    "the fitting parameters , the slope , @xmath39 and the intercept , @xmath40 , of the scaling curve are in excellent agreement with the results obtained from the other hamiltonian studies and are listed in table [ tablestat ] . the dashed line represents the finite - size scaling behaviour , equation ( [ eqn8 ] ) , which we assume holds in the hamiltonian limit also , for want of better information .",
    "it can be seen that the finite - size corrections are predicted to dominate for @xmath41 , but the date are not accurate enough at weak couplings to establish whether this is really the case .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the our monte carlo estimates for antisymmetric mass gap as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "also are shown the results from previous strong - coupling series extrapolations@xcite and quantum monte carlo calculations@xcite .",
    "it can be seen that our present results agree with previous estimates but are less accurate .",
    "finally , figure [ fig7 ] displays the behaviour of the dimensionless mass ratio , @xmath42 for the euclidean case @xmath43 . as in the ( 3 + 1)d confining theories",
    ", we may expect that quantities of this sort will approach their weak - coupling or continuum limits with corrections of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the effective lattice spacing in ` physical ' units when the mass gap has been renormalized to a constant .",
    "hence for our present purposes we _ define _ @xmath45 from equation ( [ eqn5 ] ) as @xmath46 with @xmath47 for the euclidean case .",
    "the mass ratio is plotted against @xmath45 in figure [ fig6 ] . at weak coupling",
    ", we expect the theory to approach a theory of free bosons@xcite so that the symmetric state will be composed of two @xmath26 bosons and the mass ratio should approach two .",
    "our results show that as @xmath45 goes to zero , the mass ratio rises to around the expected value of @xmath48 .",
    "a linear fit to the data from @xmath49 gives an intercept however , we note that the last one of our estimates , together with two from teper@xcite , lie considerably _ above _ @xmath50 . in the bluk systems , of course , the ratio can not rise above 2 , because it is always possible to construct a @xmath25 state out of two @xmath26 mesons .",
