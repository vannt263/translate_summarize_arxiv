    "cooperative communication has been an interesting topic for researchers in recent years .",
    "cooperative communications refer to systems or techniques that allow users to help transmit each other s messages to the destination .",
    "most cooperative transmission schemes involve two phases of transmission : a coordination phase , where users exchange their own source data and control messages with each other and/or the destination , and a cooperation phase , where the users cooperatively retransmit their messages to the destination .",
    "to enable cooperation among users , different relay technology can be employed depending on the relative user location , channel condition and transceiver complexity .",
    "there are some of the basic cooperative relaying techniques such as decode - and - forward ( df ) in which the relay decodes the received signals and forwards it either as is or re - encoded to the destination regardless whether the relay can decode correctly or not .",
    "the relay could also only forward the correctly decoded messages , which is referred to as the selective df ( s - df ) protocol , amplify - and forward ( af ) in which the signal received by the relay is amplified , frequency translated and retransmitted , coded cooperation ( cc ) that can be viewed as a generalization of df relaying schemes where more powerful channel codes ( other than simple repetition codes used in the df schemes ) are utilized in both phases of the cooperative transmission . when using repetition codes , the same codeword is transmitted twice ( either by the source or the relay ) and , thus , bandwidth efficiency is decreased by one half and compress and forward ( cf ) schemes refer which to cases where the relay forwards quantized , estimated , or compressed versions of its observation to the destination .",
    "in contrast to df or cc schemes , the relay in cf schemes need not decode perfectly the source message but need only to extract , from its observation , the information that is most relevant to the decoding at the destination .",
    "the amount of information extracted and forwarded to the destination depends on the capacity of the relay destination link @xcite .",
    "because the relay selection schemes make an efficient use of time and frequency resources , several selective combining schemes have been introduced in recent years . in @xcite",
    ", the authors introduced an opportunistic relaying method which a single relay based on the best end - to - end instantaneous snr criterion is selected and then forwards the message to the destination .",
    "they derived analytical results at high snrs and the outage probability was nt derived in closed - form .",
    "the authors in @xcite and @xcite analyzed an adaptive df relay method which only a number of relays were selected to send the messages to the destination .",
    "they proved that increasing the number of relays could not always decrease the outage probability .",
    "a selection combiner at the destination with af relays have been studied in @xcite on nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels where , a closed - form formula for the outage probability was derived . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors presented closed - form formulas for the performance of selective df relaying in nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels without considering the direct link between source and destination .",
    "the authors in @xcite introduced a closed - form expression for the outage probability and average channel capacity using the best relay selection scheme over independent and non - identical rayleigh fading channels .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no one derived exact closed - form expressions for the outage probability , symbol error probability and average channel capacity for multi - antenna sc - df relay networks over nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels .    in this chapter , we derived closed - form formulas for outage probability , moment generation function , symbol error probability and average channel capacity .",
    "in addition , we minimized the outage probability with optimal and adaptive power allocation .",
    "the reminder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the system model under consideration .",
    "section iii gives an analytical approach to evaluate the outage probability , mgf , symbol error probability and average channel capacity of the system . in section iv , we formulate outage probability problem to optimize the approximate version of our problem which leads to a closed from analytical solution . finally , section v presents monte - carlo simulation to verify the analytical results .",
    "consider a cooperative relay system that consists of @xmath1 users , one acting as the source and @xmath2 serving as the relays .",
    "each relay has two receive antennas .",
    "let us denote the source by @xmath3 , the destination by @xmath4 , and label the relays from @xmath5 to @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath6 is the source transmission power , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the channel coefficients between source and first receiver antenna of relay ( i.e. , the @xmath9 link ) , and between source and the second receiver antenna of relay ( i.e. , the @xmath10 link ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 is the channel coefficient between relay @xmath12 and the destination ( i.e. , the @xmath13 link . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are noise variances at relay @xmath12 and destination , respectively .",
    "moreover , the instantaneous snr for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath13 links are given by @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in df selection relaying , all relays attempt to decode the source s message in phase i and act as candidate relays for selection in phase ii only if it has successfully decoded the message . for simplicity , we assume the case where no diversity combining is employed at the destination . hence , the system reduces to a dual - hop transmission where the maximum achievable rate is limited by the minimum capacity among and links . given that relay",
    "was selected , the end to end snr can be computed as @xmath19 where @xmath20",
    "the snr per symbol of the this channel , @xmath21 , is distributed according to a gamma distribution given by @xcite , where @xmath0 is nakagami-@xmath0 fading parameters and @xmath22 is average snr per symbol .",
    "the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of this channel are given by @xcite , where @xmath23 is the upper incomplete gamma function which is defined as @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the channel parameters for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath13 links , respectively .",
    "since @xmath29 and @xmath30 are independent gamma random variables and assuming that @xmath0 is integer and then by using @xmath31 @xcite , the cdf of @xmath12-th branch can be written as ( see appendix ) @xmath32\\left [ { { e^ { - \\alpha \\gamma } } \\sum\\limits_{l = 0}^{m - 1 } { \\frac{{{\\alpha ^l}{\\gamma ^l}}}{{l ! } } } } \\right]\\nonumber\\\\   = & 1 - 2{e^ { - 2\\alpha \\gamma } } \\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{m - 1 } { \\sum\\limits_{l = 0}^{m - 1 } { \\frac{{{\\alpha ^{i + l}}{\\gamma ^{i + l}}}}{{i!l ! } } } } { \\rm {               } } + { e^ { - 3\\alpha \\gamma } } \\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^{m - 1 } { \\sum\\limits_{j = 0}^{m - 1 } { \\sum\\limits_{l = 0}^{m - 1 } { \\frac{{{\\alpha ^{i + j + l}}{\\gamma ^{i + j + l}}}}{{i!j!l ! } } } } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath33 can be computed by differentiating ( 1 ) with respect to @xmath34 and after some simple manipulations as follows : @xmath35 the pdf of selective combining snr can be written as    @xmath36    using multinomial coefficient as ( 9 ) and after some manipulations , ( 8) can be simplified as ( 10 )    @xmath37    @xmath38}^{2p } } } \\right)\\nonumber\\\\\\times &    \\left ( { { e^ { - 3q\\alpha \\gamma } } { { \\left [ { \\sum\\limits_{j = 0}^{m - 1 } { \\frac{{{\\alpha ^j}{\\gamma ^j}}}{{j ! } } } } \\right]}^{3q } } } \\right )   \\bigg\\ }   \\times { p_{{\\gamma _ k}}}(\\gamma ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using multinomial coefficients and some simple manipulations , following relation is always held .",

    "the ser is given by @xcite and approximation is given by @xcite .",
    "the channel capacity can be computed as @xcite    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the transmitted signal bandwidth . by substituting ( 8) in ( 10 ) and using @xcite ,",
    "the averaged channel capacity can be obtained in closed - form in ( 11 )    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the meijer - g function @xcite .",
    "to minimize the outage probability , we define optimization problem as follows :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the total power of the system . because of non - convexity of the above problem @xcite",
    ", we solved this problem numerically for nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels .",
    "we have compared the optimal power allocation with adaptive and equal power allocation . in adaptive power allocation , source and relay powers",
    "are allocated as follows :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the number of antennas , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    for the rayleigh case ,",
    "the problem can be formulated as follows :    @xmath59    by approximating the cdf of @xmath12-th branch , then we have @xcite    @xmath60    we can rewrite problem as follow :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath30 are exponentially distributed with means @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . by introducing the lagrange multiplier and by applying the kkt conditions @xcite , after some simple manipulations",
    ", the power allocation equation can be obtained as    @xmath70    where    @xmath71    using @xcite and after some simple manipulation , the optimal power allocation can be obtained as    @xmath72    where    @xmath73 ,    @xmath74{{r + \\sqrt d } } $ ] ,    @xmath75{{r - \\sqrt d } } $ ] ,    @xmath76 ,    @xmath77",
    "to verify our analytical results , we show statistical simulation results and compare them with our analytical for the outage probability , symbol error probability and average channel capacity . in all simulation and analytical results",
    "we consider the system with 16psk modulation and @xmath78 for two topologies :    \\1 ) symmetric case e.g. ,    @xmath79    and 2 ) asymmetric case e.g. ,    @xmath80    @xmath81 .    in fig . 2 , and fig",
    "3 , the outage and symbol error probability for df relay selection scheme versus snr for nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels are shown .",
    "as we can see , our proposed approach has more than 1 db performance in comparison with @xcite .            in fig .",
    "4 , the outage probability versus snr in different number of relays and different number of relay antennas are shown . as we can see , as the number of relays increase , the double antennas case has more advantage versus single antenna case .",
    "also , using 4 relays with two antennas has more advantage than using 5 relays with single antenna in considerable range of snr .",
    "it was shown that the average snr gain increases with the number of the diversity combining antennas , but not linearly .",
    "the largest gain increment is achieved by going from one receiver antenna ( no diversity ) to two antennas .",
    "increasing the number of receiving antenna from two to three will give much less gain than going from one to two @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we studied a relay system with two receiving antennas in order to have the largest gain increment and the least complexity increment .        in fig . 5 and 6 , we have shown the outage probability of the sc - df relay for nakagami-@xmath0 and rayleigh fading channels , respectively .",
    "as we can see , the optimal power allocation has more than 1db performance in comparison with equal power allocation .",
    "also , approximate optimal power allocation is very close to optimal numerical optimization .            in fig .",
    "7 , the average channel capacity in analytical and simulation for nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels has been shown . where @xmath2 is the number of relays . as we can see , the average channel capacity increases as @xmath2 increases .",
    "moreover , sc scheme can outperform the direct transmission at higher snr if the total number of relays ( @xmath2 ) can be increased .",
    "there are other channels that can be analyzed under this strategy such as log - normal , rican ( nakagami-@xmath82 ) and hoyt ( nakagami-@xmath83 ) fading channels . from the practical point of view",
    ", log - normal distribution is encountered in many communication scenarios .",
    "for instance , when indoor communication is used at which users are moving , log - normal distribution not only models the moving objects , but also the reflection of the bodies .",
    "moreover , it models the action of communicating with robots in a closed environment like a factory .    in indoor radio propagation environments , terminals with low mobility",
    "have to rely on macroscopic diversity to overcome the shadowing from indoor obstacles and moving human bodies .",
    "indeed , in such slowly varying channels , the small - scale and large - scale effects tend to get mixed . in this case",
    ", log - normal statistics accurately describe the distribution of the channel path gain . in most of the scenarios ,",
    "we assume that the relay and the destination have perfect knowledge of the channel gains ; however , this is not practical .",
    "this scenario can be reconsidered by assuming that we do not have the perfect knowledge of the channel gains between the source - relay and the relay - destination .",
    "another important relaying protocol that has not been considered in this chapter is the af relaying .",
    "as we said , in this method there is an analog amplifier in the relay witch amplifies the received signal and then forwards it , and no digital processing such as coding and error estimation takes effect , so implementing af relay based network is easy .",
    "most importantly , if our area of work is in the high snr , both af and df have the same performance , so we d better use the af relaying .",
    "one of other important drawbacks of the wireless communication systems is the delay feedback in which the selected relay index is sent from the destination to the relays .",
    "till we have slow varying channel compared to the time slot and the delay feedback , there will be no serious problem for the performance of the system ; however , if the channel is varying fast , the channel gain of the selected relay will change , and the information will not be sent through the best channel .",
    "interested readers can refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "in this chapter , we have analyzed the performance of a multi - antenna selective decode - and - forward relaying system over nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels without and with the direct link between source and destination .",
    "we have derived the outage probability , moment generation function , symbol error probability and average channel capacity in closed - form . also , we derived an approximation problem to minimize outage probability and then we solved the problem .",
    "simulation results verified the accuracy and the correctness of the proposed analysis .",
    "the complexity of double antenna case versus single antenna case , is nt very high and instead of increasing the number of relays , increasing the number of antennas is a practical option .",
