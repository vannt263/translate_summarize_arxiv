    "glasses and gels are disordered solids with an arrested dynamics . according to a gross classification , glasses are high density materials dominated by short range repulsion , hard sphere colloids being a paradigmatic case , whereas attractive interactions are necessary to form the low density and fractal structure characterizing gels .",
    "polymeric suspensions represent a typical example of systems , where the inter - particle interaction can be finely tuned to obtain a glass or a gel . in absence of cross  linkers or depletants , the system is well described as a hard sphere suspension : the dynamic slow down is driven by increasing the volume fraction @xmath0 , with the glass transition occurring at a critical threshold , @xmath1 .",
    "this transition marks the arrest of the dynamics at all relevant length scales , for wave - vectors ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 sizes of the system and of the particles .",
    "surprisingly , this sharp dynamic transition is not accompanied by any clear structural signature  @xcite .",
    "standard pair correlation functions , such as the structure factor or the radial distribution function , poorly change across the transition , whereas the possibility to find a signature in more complex structural quantities remains a major and long standing open issue in condensed matter  @xcite .",
    "a polymeric suspension can also form a permanent gel , even at density much smaller than @xmath1 , on increasing the cross  linker concentration , for instance , by radiation as in light induced polymerization processes ( e.g. , dental filling pastes ) or by heat ( e.g. , cooking ) . in that way , the system is driven across a percolation transition , where a spanning cluster of connected monomers emerges .",
    "this also leads to a dynamical arrest transition , as the dynamics becomes frozen on the smallest wave - vector @xmath6 , the spanning cluster being unable to diffuse .",
    "thus , the dynamical transition of permanent gels originates from a well defined structural phase transition ( percolation ) .    despite the apparent differences between the glass and the gel transition , both of them are accompanied by the emergence of dynamic heterogeneities ( dhs )  @xcite , groups of particles , spatially correlated over a time scale of the order of the relaxation time .",
    "dhs have been suggested to play a role similar to critical fluctuations in critical phenomena , and seem very promising to distinguish between competing theories and understanding differences and universality in the dynamical arrest transition .    in this paper , we review recent results on dhs in numerical models of chemical gels ( permanent bonds ) , colloidal gels ( temporary bonds ) and colloidal glasses ( no bonds ) , focusing on the connection with the structure .",
    "we start by discussing the case of chemical gels , where for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the dynamic susceptibility @xmath9 tends to the mean cluster size , which diverges at the gelation threshold  @xcite .",
    "then , we consider to what extent this scenario holds on moving from chemical to colloidal gels  @xcite , and from colloidal gels to colloidal glasses  @xcite , i.e. as the slow dynamics is no longer due to the presence of bonds , but rather to particle crowding .",
    "while the framework of chemical gels can not be trivially extended to glasses , it can still lead to novel approaches if the relevant clusters are suitably defined . as an example",
    ", we consider the case of a simple colloidal glass model , where the relaxation process and the emergence of dhs can be related to a reverse percolation transition . as a final perspective ,",
    "we discuss which percolation model may describe the glass transition .",
    "the transition from solutions ( sol ) to chemical gels is due to the onset of a permanent spanning cluster , which gives rise to the divergence of the viscosity as the transition is approached from the sol phase , and to an elastic modulus vanishing as the transition is approached from the gel phase . since the pioneering work of flory  @xcite , chemical gelation has been explained in terms of percolation models ( for a review see  @xcite ) . here",
    ", we consider a model for chemical gels extensively studied in ref .",
    "@xcite using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . briefly , after equilibrating a system of @xmath10 particles , interacting via the weeks - chandler - andersen ( wca ) potential  @xcite , permanent bonds between particles at a distance smaller than @xmath11 are introduced , by adding a finitely extendable nonlinear elastic potential ( fene )  @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations have shown a percolation transition at volume fraction @xmath12 , with critical exponents in agreement with random percolation .",
    "for further details on the md simulations see refs .",
    "alternatives models have been described in refs .",

    "the emergence of dhs is characterized by the dynamical susceptibility , @xmath9 defined as the fluctuations of the self intermediate scattering function ( isf ) , @xmath13 : @xmath14 is the thermal average for a fixed bond configuration , @xmath15 $ ] is the average over the bond configurations , and @xmath16 .",
    "the wave - vector @xmath17 allows to probe dhs at different length scales .     as a function of @xmath18 for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( from bottom to top ) . *",

    "the data are fitted by the power law @xmath30 with @xmath31 . adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite ]    in the main frame of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , @xmath9 is plotted as a function of time for @xmath32 and different @xmath0 . in this case , for each value of the volume fraction , @xmath33 reaches a plateau after a characteristic time of the order of the relaxation time .",
    "it was theoretically shown @xcite , and numerically verified , that , in the limit of small @xmath17 , the asymptotic value of @xmath9 coincides with the mean cluster size ( see inset of fig.[fig:1 ] ) , defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of cluster of size @xmath36 , which diverges at the gelation threshold with the random percolation exponent @xmath37 .",
    "thus , in chemical gels , dhs are due to the presence of clusters of bonded particles .",
    "this result also indicates that the percolation exponents can be measured by means of the asymptotic dynamic susceptibility , and that the asymptotic value of the dynamical susceptibility plays the same role as the static scattering function near a liquid - gas critical point .",
    "we note that the dynamical susceptibility shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] is qualitatively different from that observed in glasses . in glasses @xmath38 does not asymptotically reaches a plateau , but has a maximum and then decays to zero  @xcite .",
    "in chemical gels , where the structural arrest is related to the formation of clusters of bonded particles , the dynamical susceptibility can be directly connected to the clusters .",
    "this clarifies the nature of the slow dynamics / structural arrest in these gels as compared to hard sphere glasses  @xcite , where bonds do not exist at all .",
    "very intriguing is the case of gels formed in attractive colloids  @xcite , which are in between these two extremes . in these systems , upon tuning the strength of the attractive interactions , one can go from an irreversible gel , very similar to the chemical gel just described , to a non - permanent colloidal gel and , finally , to a hard sphere glass . for example , the addition of non - adsorbing polymers to the suspension induces effective attractive interactions between the colloidal particles due to depletion  @xcite . in this case , in the temperature - volume fraction plane , the structural arrest line , i.e. where jamming transition occurs , typically interferes with the coexistence curve  @xcite .",
    "gelation may occur , due to an interrupted phase separation , which has been accurately studied in a combined experimental and numerical effort  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a long range repulsion between particles , due for example to the presence of residual charges , may suppress phase separation and avoid its interference with gelation .",
    "a dlvo - type potential can be used to model this kind of effective interactions , as often seen in the literature  @xcite .",
    "actually , it was shown that the competing attraction and repulsion favors ordered columnar and lamellar phases at low temperatures  @xcite , therefore limiting the possibility to study the metastable states associated to slow dynamics and structural arrest . however , upon adding a small degree of polydispersity , it is possible to avoid the ordered phases and study the arrested line without such interference  @xcite .",
    "since the study of dhs in these systems might unveil new behaviors arising in intermediate situations and shed new light on the nature of the structural arrest , we now review some findings on a dlvo - type model from ref.@xcite and refer to this paper for further details on the md simulations .",

    "a geometrical interpretation of @xmath33 in this system can be given by considering the time dependent mean cluster size @xmath46 of mobile particles @xcite . here",
    "two particles are considered as part of the same cluster if they are bonded both a time zero and at time @xmath18 . in the inset of fig.[fig:2]b ) , @xmath46 is plotted for volume fraction @xmath50 and @xmath51 . at low volume fraction",
    "the coincidence of @xmath33 and @xmath46 is excellent . at higher volume fraction",
    "the maximum of @xmath33 is larger than the maximum of @xmath46 , denoting that the contribution to the peak comes not only from the cluster formation , but also from the crowding of the particles , as usually observed in glassy systems .",
    "the figure exemplifies that there are two different mechanisms underlying the presence of significant dhs at different volume fractions .",
    "it also shows the crossover from the cluster dominated regime to the crowding dominated regime .",
    "we now discuss how arguments from percolation and gels can be useful to characterize the relaxation process and dhs in glasses , where particles interact via a hard core repulsion , and the dynamics slows down at high density due to crowding . to this aim , we review recent results  @xcite from numerical simulations of the ka lattice model  @xcite .",

    "previous studies have shown that this model reproduces many aspects of glass forming systems , as the dynamics slows down on increasing the density , and suggests the existence of a transition of structural arrest at @xmath55  @xcite .",

    "indeed , the absence of the percolating cluster should lead to the loss of rigidity . in order to investigate whether this supposed transition was related to the relaxation process",
    ", we define a dynamical kind of bond , similarly to the case of colloidal gels : two particles @xmath58 and @xmath84 are bonded in the interval @xmath59 $ ] if they are nearest neighbors and persistent in this time interval .    in fig.[fig:4 ] , we show @xmath85 , the density of persistent particles belonging to the spanning cluster",
    ". @xmath85 vanishes at a time @xmath86 , which is found to scale with the relaxation times , @xmath70 , as the density increases ( fig.[fig:4 ] , inset ) .",
    "the figure also reveals that the cluster strength overlaps with the total density of persistent particles , @xmath87 , up to large times .",
    "this means that in this interval the percolating cluster is the only cluster present . at larger time",
    ", @xmath88 slowly decays , while @xmath89 vanishes , because of the emergence of finite clusters , with a broad size distribution , which give contributions to @xmath78 , but not to @xmath90 .",
    "this circumstance may explain the crossover from power - law to stretched exponential observed for @xmath91 @xcite : indeed the short time decay is characterized by a single relaxation time , whereas the long time decay results from a broad spectra of finite cluster lifetime .    to better understand the geometrical properties of this process",
    ", we investigate the correlation length , @xmath92 , which is defined by the percolative correlation function @xmath93 : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the probabilities that two sites @xmath58 and @xmath84 , in the configuration of persistent particles at time @xmath18 , belong to the same finite cluster , or to the percolating cluster respectively . accordingly ,",
    "if the percolating cluster is absent , @xmath97 , and @xmath92 measures the typical size of finite clusters .",
    "conversely , if finite clusters are negligible , then @xmath98 measures the extension of the density fluctuations within the percolating cluster . in our case , at short time , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , because almost all persistent particles belong to the percolating cluster , making the connectedness condition negligible  @xcite . inserting these equalities in eq.([g_per_inf ] ) and comparing it with the definition of the four point correlation function , @xmath101 , eq.([eq : gr ] ) , we find that @xmath102 , and consequently @xmath103 . indeed , fig.[fig:4 ] confirms that the dynamical correlation length coincides with the percolative length , as long as finite clusters are negligible .",
    "the fact that finite clusters are essentially absent until a spanning cluster exists , suggests that this percolation is different from the random percolation , which drives instead the chemical gelation .",
    "thus , what is the type of percolation relevant to describe the relaxation process in the ka model ?",
    "the scenario emerging from the related mean field case could be useful to tackle this issue .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite , the dynamical behavior of the fredrickson and andersen ( fa ) facilitated model @xcite , which is a spin version of the ka model , was indeed studied on the bethe lattice . in the infinite time limit , this model reproduces @xcite the bootstrap percolation ( bp ) model  @xcite . in bp ,",
    "the lattice sites are occupied randomly with density @xmath104 .",
    "then each particle , which has less than a fixed number @xmath105 of neighbors , is removed , until a stable configuration is reached .",
    "this configuration is made of clusters of particles , where each particle has less than @xmath105 neighbors .",
    "bp on the bethe lattice of coordination number @xmath106 has a mixed order transition when @xmath107 . below the percolation threshold ,",
    "there are no occupied sites , while above the threshold there are no finite clusters , but only an infinite cluster which is called @xmath108cluster .",
    "the percolation order parameter , @xmath109 , jumps discontinuously at the threshold from @xmath110 to @xmath111 , and the approach to @xmath111 from the percolating phase is characterized by a critical exponent @xmath112  @xcite , while the fluctuation of the order parameter and the associated length diverge with exponents @xmath113 and @xmath114  @xcite , respectively .",
    "summarizing , in the fa model , the infinite time limit of the dynamical order parameter , its fluctuation and the dynamical length are given by the corresponding static quantities of bp .",
    "consequently , these static quantities are different from zero only in the glassy phase , and become critical at the threshold .",
    "nevertheless , in the liquid phase , the time dependent dynamical quantities @xmath78 , @xmath72 and @xmath79 of the fa model , although tend to zero in the infinite time limit , reflect at finite time the behavior of the bp static quantities  @xcite .",
    "the picture is similar to that found in the liquid phase of colloidal gels , in the particular case in which the bond lifetime and the relaxation time become comparable , with the difference that random percolation drives the dynamical transition in gel models , whereas bootstrap percolation drives the glass transition in the fa model .",
    "interestingly enough there is strong evidence @xcite that the dynamical behavior of the fa model on the bethe lattice and of gel systems in mean field are related  @xcite to the ones predicted by the discontinuous and the continuous mode coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the study of dhs allows to clarify the nature of slow dynamics and structural arrest in gels and glasses .",
    "the behavior of the dynamical susceptibility in chemical gelation is quite different from that found in hard sphere glasses .",
    "it grows steadily and reaches a plateau , whose value , in the low wave - vector limit , coincides with the mean cluster size . in colloidal gelation , at low temperature , dhs are associated to clusters made of long living bonds and the dynamical susceptibility reaches a plateau , as found in chemical gels , except that it decays to zero at long times , due to the finite lifetime of the clusters .",
    "dhs in physical gels are also analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a fene model with finite bond lifetime is studied using molecular dynamics simulations . however , the dynamical susceptibility , evaluated only at large wave - vectors , displays the behavior usually found in glassy systems .",
    "we expect that also in that case , when the bond lifetime is long enough , the dynamical susceptibility in the gel phase displays , at small wave - vectors , a plateau at intermediate times , signaling the presence of persistent clusters . at higher volume fraction ,",
    "dhs crossover to a different behavior , where crowding starts to play a role , which becomes dominant for glasses . in this case",
    ", bootstrap percolation model seems to provide a geometrical characterization of dhs .",

    "<S> the dynamical arrest of gels is the consequence of a well defined structural phase transition , leading to the formation of a spanning cluster of bonded particles . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical glass transition , instead , is not accompanied by any clear structural signature . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , both transitions are characterized by the emergence of dynamical heterogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> reviewing recent results from numerical simulations , we discuss the behavior of dynamical heterogeneities in different systems and show that a clear connection with the structure exists in the case of gels </S>",
    "<S> . the emerging picture may be also relevant for the more elusive case of glasses . </S>",
    "<S> we show , as an example , that the relaxation process of a simple glass - forming model can be related to a reverse percolation transition and discuss further perspective in this direction . </S>",
