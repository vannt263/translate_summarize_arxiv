    "in this paper we solve the following `` polynomial moment problem '' : _ for given @xmath3 $ ] and distinct @xmath4 to describe @xmath5 $ ] such that 1 ^b_a p^i(z)q(z)z=0 for all @xmath6 .",
    "_    the polynomial moment problem was posed in the series of papers @xcite-@xcite in connection with the center problem for the abel differential equation ab = p(z)y^2+q(z)y^3 . with polynomial coefficients",
    "@xmath7 in the complex domain . for given @xmath4 the center problem for the abel equation is to find necessary and sufficient conditions on @xmath8 which imply the equality @xmath9 for any solution @xmath10 of with @xmath11 small enough .",
    "this problem is closely related to the classical center - focus problem of poincar and has been studied in many recent papers ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite , @xcite ) .    the center problem for the abel equation is connected with the polynomial moment problem in several ways .",
    "for example , it was shown in @xcite that for the parametric version @xmath12 of the `` infinitesimal '' center conditions with respect to @xmath13 reduce to moment equations with @xmath14 on the other hand , it was shown in @xcite that `` at infinity '' ( under an appropriate projectivization of the parameter space ) the system of equations on the coefficients of @xmath1 , describing the center set of for fixed @xmath15 , also reduces to .",
    "many other results concerning connections between the center problem and the polynomial moment problem can be found in @xcite .",
    "these results convince that a thorough description of solutions of system is an important step in the understanding of the center problem for the abel equation .",
    "there exists a natural condition on @xmath0 and @xmath16 which reduces equations , to similar equations with respect to polynomials of smaller degrees .",
    "namely , suppose that there exist polynomials @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 with @xmath20 such that 2 p(z)=p(w(z ) ) ,   q(z)=q(w(z ) ) .",
    "then after the change of variable @xmath21 equations transform to the equations zam ^w(b)_w(a ) p^i(w)q^(w)w=0 , while equation transforms to the equation ab1 = p^ ( w)y^2+q^(w)y^3 .    furthermore , if the polynomial @xmath19 in satisfies the equality w w(a)=w(b ) , then the cauchy theorem implies that the polynomial @xmath22 is a solution of system and hence the polynomial @xmath23 is a solution of system .",
    "similarly , since any solution @xmath10 of equation is the pull - back pb y(z)=y(w(z ) ) of a solution @xmath24 of equation , if @xmath19 satisfies then equation has a center .",
    "this justifies the following definition : a center for equation or a solution of system is called _ reducible _ if there exist polynomials @xmath25 @xmath18 @xmath19 such that conditions , hold . the main conjecture concerning the center problem for the abel equation (  the composition conjecture for the abel equation \" ) , supported by the results obtained in the papers cited above , states that any center for the abel equation is reducible ( see @xcite and the bibliography there ) .    by analogy with the composition conjecture it was suggested (  the composition conjecture for the polynomial moment problem \" ) that , under the additional assumption @xmath26 any solution of ( 1 ) is reducible .",
    "this conjecture was shown to be true in many cases .",
    "for instance , if @xmath27 are not critical points of @xmath0 ( @xcite ) , if @xmath0 is indecomposable ( @xcite ) , and in some other special cases ( see e. g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , in general the composition conjecture for the polynomial moment problem fails to be true .",
    "namely , it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath0 has several `` compositional right factors '' @xmath19 such that @xmath28 , then it may happen that the sum of reducible solutions corresponding to these factors is a non - reducible solution .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that actually _ any _ non - reducible solution of is a sum of reducible ones . since compositional factors @xmath19 of a polynomial @xmath0",
    "can be defined explicitly , such a description of non - reducible solutions of would be very helpful , especially for applications to the abel equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , until now this conjecture was verified only in a single special case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , another necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial @xmath1 to be a solution of was constructed in @xcite .",
    "namely , it was shown in @xcite that there exists a finite system of equations su _ i=1^nf_s , iq(p^-1_i(z))=0 ,  f_s , i ,  1sk , where @xmath16 and @xmath29 @xmath30 are branches of the algebraic function @xmath31 , such that holds if and only if holds .",
    "moreover , this system was constructed explicitly with the use of a special planar tree @xmath32 which represents the monodromy group @xmath33 of the algebraic function @xmath31 in a combinatorial way . by construction , points @xmath27 are vertices of @xmath32 and system reflects the combinatorics of the path connecting @xmath34 and @xmath35 on @xmath32 .",
    "a finite system of equations is more convenient for a study than initial infinite system of equations . in particular , in many cases the analysis of permits to conclude that for given @xmath36 any solution of is reducible ( see @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we develop necessary algebraic and analytic techniques which allow us to describe solutions of in the general case and to prove that any solution of is a sum of reducible ones .",
    "so , our main result is the following theorem .",
    "os a non - zero polynomial @xmath1 is a solution of system ( 1 ) if and only if @xmath16 can be represented as a sum of polynomials @xmath37 such that cc p(z)=p_j(w_j(z ) ) ,  q_j(z)=q_j(w_j(z ) ) ,  _ and _",
    "w_j(a)=w_j(b ) for some polynomials @xmath38 .    note that since conditions of the theorem impose no restrictions on the values of @xmath0 at the points @xmath27 the theorem implies in particular that non - zero solutions of exist if and only if the equality @xmath39 holds . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath39 then for any @xmath40 $ ] the polynomial @xmath41 is a solution of since we can set @xmath42 in , .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath43 is a solution of then equalities imply that @xmath39 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we give a detailed account of definitions and previous results related to the polynomial moment problem .",
    "in particular , starting from system , we introduce a linear subspace @xmath44 of @xmath45 generated by the vectors @xmath46 and study its basic properties .",
    "it follows from the definition that @xmath44 is invariant with respect to the permutation matrix representation of the group @xmath33 . in the third section of the paper ,",
    "written entirely in the framework of the group theory , we describe a general structure of such subspaces .",
    "more generally , we describe subspaces of @xmath45 invariant with respect to the permutation matrix representation of a permutation group @xmath47 of degree @xmath48 , containing a cycle of length @xmath48 . roughly speaking ,",
    "we show that the structure of invariant subspaces of @xmath45 for such @xmath47 depends on imprimitivity systems of @xmath47 only .",
    "we believe that this result is new and interesting by itself .    finally , in the fourth section , using the description of @xmath33-invariant subspaces of @xmath45 and results and techniques of @xcite , we prove theorem [ os ] .",

    "therefore , the taylor expansion of @xmath59 at infinity and the corresponding germ @xmath60 do not depend on the choice of @xmath61    after the change of variable @xmath62 integral transforms to the cauchy type integral ci h(t)= _ , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is obtained by the analytic continuation along @xmath65 of a germ of the algebraic function @xmath66 clearly , integral representation defines an analytic function in each domain of the complement of @xmath65 in @xmath67 .",

    "subsequently , in the paper @xcite was proposed a construction which permits to obtain conditions for the vanishing of @xmath60 in a very explicit form .",
    "briefly , the idea of @xcite is to choose the integration path @xmath55 in such a way that its image under the mapping @xmath78 does not divide the riemann sphere .",

    "moreover , since the preimage of infinity under @xmath0 consists of a unique point , @xmath91 consists of a unique disk and hence the graph @xmath32 is a tree .",
