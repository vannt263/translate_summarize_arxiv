    "traditionally , the results of these experiments are treated within the framework of the phenomenological landau - lifshitz - gilbert model@xcite , describing the fmr response in terms of uniform precession of magnetization @xmath0 with the preserved in time magnitude @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "the dynamical equation governing precessional motions of @xmath0 can be conveniently written in the following general form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electronic gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath5 is the magnetic permeability of free space ; si units are used throughout this paper .",

    "the material - dependent parameter @xmath15 can be thought of as describing the strength effect of the intrinsic anisotropy on the relaxation dynamics of magnetization precession which is constrained by the conditions @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in this paper",
    "we consider an alternative micromagnetic treatment of @xmath10 according to which the origin of the damping torque responsible for spin relaxation in multilayered metallic films is attributed to the coupling between the uniformly precessing magnetization - vector and the stress - tensors of intrinsic and extrinsic magnetic anisotropy .",

    "making use of argument of physical dimension it is easy to show that the material - dependent parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( measuring strength of intrinsic and extrinsic stresses on the relaxation process in multilayered film ) can be represented in terms of dimensionless damping constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( whose magnitudes are deduced from the empirical frequency dependence of fmr linewidth ) as follows @xmath44 the net outcome of the above outlined procedure of computing the combined ( intrinsic plus extrinsic ) damping torque @xmath45\\,[{\\bf m}(t)\\times[{\\bf m}(t)\\times { \\bf h}]],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] entering the basic equation of micromagnetic dynamics ( [ e1.1 ] ) is the following modified landau - lifshitz ( mll ) equation @xmath46\\\\ \\nonumber & -&\\left[\\alpha\\frac{\\gamma\\mu_0}{m_s}-\\beta\\left(\\frac{\\gamma\\mu_0}{m_s}\\right)^2\\frac{({\\bf m}\\cdot { \\bf h})}{\\omega}\\right]\\,[{\\bf m}\\times[{\\bf m}\\times { \\bf h}]],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which obeys all constraints of the canonical ll equation .",
    "one sees that unlike the linear - in - magnetic - field intrinsic damping torque , the extrinsic damping torque is described by quadratic - in - magnetic - field relaxation function . at this point",
    "it seems noteworthy that the need in allowing for the quadratic - in-@xmath47 damping terms has been discussed long ago@xcite .",

    "our approach is based on the observation that the equation of magnetization energy loss in the process of a uniform precession of magnetization in a dc magnetic field @xmath57 is reduced to the equation for the cosine function @xmath58 of angle @xmath59 between @xmath0 and @xmath14 , namely @xmath60,\\quad \\omega=\\gamma\\mu_0 h.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the right hand side of ( [ e3.4 ] ) suggests that there are two equilibrium configurations , namely , with @xmath61 corresponding to @xmath62 and @xmath63 corresponding to @xmath64 .",

    "the considered regime of the magnon - free spin relaxation ( in which the wave vector of spin wave @xmath89 ) is quite different from spin relaxation caused by two - magnon scattering@xcite .",
    "the most conspicuous feature of this ( substantially macroscopic ) mechanism , responsible for the non - linear frequency dependence of fmr linewidth , is the transient magnetization configuration owing its existence to the extrinsic stresses generic to the multilayered films .",
