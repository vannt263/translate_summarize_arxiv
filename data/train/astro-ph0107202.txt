    "circinus x1 ( cir x1 ) is a puzzling x  ray binary .",
    "because of its rapid variability a black hole was supposed to be the compact object in this system ( toor , 1977 ) , until type  i x  ray bursts were detected ( tennant et _ al .",
    "_ , 1986 a , b ) , suggesting that the compact object is a neutron star .",
    "a modulation with a period of 16.6 days was observed at several wavelengths in the emission of the source .",
    "the high stability of this period was a strong indication that it is the orbital period of cir x1 .",
    "the orbit is highly eccentric ( @xmath7 ) ( murdin et al .",
    "1980 ; tauris et al . 1999 ) .",
    "periodic radio flares near the zero phase ( i.e.  at the periastron , for recent ephemeris see stewart et _ al .",
    "_ , 1991 ) are also accompanied by drastic changes in the x  ray lightcurve ( x  ray flares and dips ) .",
    "the position of the probable radio counterpart is close to the supernova remnant g321.90.3 ( clark , parkinson & caswell , 1975 ) , suggesting that cir x1 could be a runaway binary .",
    "case & bhattacharya ( 1998 ) have revised the distance to the supernova remnant g321.9 - 0.3 , and hence to the associated cir x1 , to 5.5 kpc . therefore in the following",
    "we adopt 5.5 kpc as the distance to the source .",
    "quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) at 100200 hz were observed in this source ( tennant , 1987 ; shirey et al . , 1996 ) , but no khz qpos were detected .",
    "recently iaria et al .",
    "( 2001 ) detected the presence of highly ionized matter around cir x1 , with hydrogen column density of @xmath8 @xmath9 , at the orbital phase 0.110.16 .",
    "the continuum emission was fitted using a comptonization model plus a power ",
    "law tail at energies higher than 10 kev .",
    "the luminosity of the power law is @xmath10 of the total .",
    "brandt & schulz ( 2000 ) , analysing chandra observations taken at the periastron , detected , for the first time in the x - ray band , the presence of p  cygni lines in x  ray band .",
    "they explain these features as due to the presence of high velocity outflows from this system ( probably a moderate temperature , @xmath11  kev , wind from the x - ray heated accretion disk ) .",
    "johnston et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , using several infrared ( ir ) and optical data from 1976 to 1997 , observed along the whole orbit an asymmetric h@xmath12 emission line .",
    "they argued that the broad component of the emission line arises in a high  velocity ( @xmath13 km s@xmath1 ) , optically thick , flow near the neutron star .",
    "brandt et al . (",
    "1996 ) , using asca data taken on 1994 august 4 - 5 , found a sudden variation of the flux at the periastron phase , the count rate increasing from @xmath14 counts s@xmath1 to @xmath15 counts s@xmath1 . in the low - count rate state they obtained a good fit using a partial covering component , in addition to a two  blackbody model , with a corresponding hydrogen column of @xmath16 @xmath9 ; in the high - count rate state the partial covering of the x - ray spectrum was not needed . because of the similarity with the spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies with compton - thin tori , brandt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that matter at the outer edge of the accretion disk , together with an edge - on disc orientation , could explain the partial covering of the spectrum in cir x1 .",
    "here we report the results of the spectral analysis in the energy range 0.610 kev performed on cir x1 data from the asca satellite taken in 1998 .",
    "these data cover a whole orbital period allowing to study the corresponding changes in the properties of the matter around the system .",
    "we performed a systematic spectral study of cir x1 along its orbital period using asca archival data taken in 1998 march between 3 and 18 .",
    "the instruments on board asca ( tanaka , inoue , & holt , 1994 ) consist of two solid  state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) and two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis , ohashi et al . , 1996 ; makishima et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "in our analysis we used only data from gis instruments .",
    "gis have an energy resolution of @xmath17 ( fwhm ) at 6 kev and their detection efficiency above @xmath18 kev is higher than with sis ( it is twice as large as the sis detection efficiency at energies of 6.57 kev ) .",
    "we used data at high telemetry from the asca archive , screened using current standard filter criteria .",
    "the gis photon extraction region was limited to the standard circular region of @xmath19 radius centered on the source .",
    "the background was taken from a @xmath19 radius circle free of emission from cir x1 in the external region of the gis field of view and after an accurate investigation of the uniform background distribution . because of the high luminosity of the source it was necessary a deadtime correction after the extraction of the lightcurves and the spectra . to correct for this effect we used the ftools _ ldeadtime _ and _ deadtime _ for lightcurves and spectra ,",
    "respectively , using the corresponding mkf files ( which contain the time - histories of various parameters from which good data can be identified and screened ) for each observation .",
    "a systematic error of @xmath20 was added to the spectra .",
    "the observations used for the analysis cover an entire orbital period from 1998 march 3 to march 19 . in table 1",
    "we report for each of the seven analysed observations ( labelled a , b , ... , g ) the start and stop times , the exposure time and the relative orbital phase assuming the orbital ephemeris as reported by stewart et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .",
    "in figure 1 we plotted the cir x1 lightcurve in the energy band 0.610 kev ( upper panel ) , and the corresponding hardness ratio , i.e.the ratio of the count rate in the energy band 37 kev to that in the band 13 kev ( lower panel ) . in the lightcurve large variabilities",
    "are observed , especially at orbital phase 00.2 , where sudden flux variations are visible , with the count rate ranging from @xmath21 counts s@xmath1 to @xmath22 counts s@xmath1 . in the same phase interval",
    "we observe a rapid decrease of the hardness ratio from @xmath23 to @xmath24 . in the phase interval",
    "0.30.6 the lightcurve does not show any significant variability and the count rate is @xmath15 counts s@xmath1 , while the hardness ratio increases from 0.7 to 0.9 . in the phase interval 0.750.88 the lightcurve shows a count rate slightly higher than 200 counts s@xmath1 and the hardness ratio is constant at @xmath25 .",
    "the longest observation on march 3 shows a large variability in the hardness ratio .",
    "therefore we divided this observation into four intervals ( labelled a1 , a2 , a3 and a4 ) , the first corresponding to the orbital phase 0.95 , the second to 0.981 , the third to 0.010.04 and the fourth to 0.050.09 . in table 2",
    "we report the intervals in which the lightcurve was divided and the corresponding orbital phases .",
    "we also show for each of the intervals the flux of the source extrapolated in the 2.525 kev energy range , in order to compare these values with previous observations .",
    "the flux in the band 2.525 kev is very similar to that measured by shirey et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with the rxte satellite . in the same table",
    "we also report the flux of the source extrapolated in the 0.1100 kev energy range ( using the best fit spectral model discussed in the next section ) , and the corresponding luminosity of the source .",
    "for each of the ten intervals described above , corresponding to different orbital phases , we extracted energy spectra , in the band 0.610 kev , in order to study the spectral variations along the orbit .",
    "the continuum emission was fitted using a comptonization model ( _ comptt _ , titarchuk 1994 ) , modified , at low energies , by photoelectric absorption by cold matter . in a previous paper ( iaria et al . , 2001 ) the broad band ( 0.1100 kev ) spectrum from the bepposax satellite did not allow to distinguish between a simple comptonization and the so - called eastern model , consisting of a multicolor disk blackbody plus a blackbody component ( mitsuda et al . , 1984",
    ") . however , because of the large value of the neutron star radius obtained from the fit ( @xmath26 km ) , we preferred the comptonization model to fit the spectrum",
    ". therefore we use the same model here .",
    "the average photoelectric absorption , obtained from the fit , is @xmath27 @xmath9 .",
    "the seed photon temperature varies from 0.51 kev near the periastron to 0.37 kev at orbital phase 0.89 .",
    "the electron temperature varies from 1 kev ( at orbital phase @xmath28 ) up to 1.7 kev ( at orbital phase 0.89 ) .",
    "the compton optical depth varies between 16 and 20 along the orbital period .    in spectra a1 ,",
    "f , and g we improved the fit adding a partial covering to the model .",
    "the probability of chance improvement for the addition of this component , estimated using an f - test , was 0.08 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "note that this component is essentially needed to fit an iron absorption edge .",
    "in fact we obtain equivalently good fits if we use an absorption edge , at energies between 7.6 and 7.9 kev , instead of the partial covering for these intervals . in this case",
    ", the edge optical depth ranges from 0.008 for interval a1 to 0.12 for interval f. however , in agreement with the results of brandt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , in the following we adopt and discuss the partial covering interpretation .    in some spectra ( a4 to e ) we detected the presence of an absorption edge from highly ionized iron . in the spectra where the partial covering is present there is not evidence of a such feature . in a2 ,",
    "a3 and d neither the partial covering nor the absorption edge are present ; in these cases we could only find an upper limit on the optical depth of the absorption edge .",
    "an emission line from ionized iron is also needed to fit some of the spectra ( a2 to a4 and c to e ) . in table 2",
    "we show the spectral features that were included in the best fit model for each of the ten spectra , and in tables 3 and 4 we report the parameters of the best fit model , together with the probability of chance improvement of the fit when the indicated component is included in the spectral model .",
    "we analyzed data of cir x1 from seven asca observations ( spanning an entire orbital period of the x - ray source ) in the energy range 0.610 kev . from these observations we extracted ten spectra corresponding to different orbital phases .",
    "the lightcurve shows large variability at the orbital phase interval 00.2 . at phases 0.30.6",
    "the lightcurve is constant and at phases 0.780.89 the count rate decreases .",
    "the equivalent hydrogen absorption column , @xmath31 , derived from the best fit model to these spectra is @xmath32 @xmath9 , in agreement with previous observations ( brandt et _ al .",
    "_ , 1996 ; iaria et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "for a distance to the source of 5.5 kpc the visual extinction in the direction of cir x1 is @xmath33 mag ( hakkila et al .",
    "1997 ) . using the observed correlation between visual extinction and absorption column ( predehl & schmitt 1995 ) we find that the expected hydrogen column for cir x1 is @xmath34 @xmath9 .",
    "it is slightly smaller than the value obtained from the fit , probably because of the presence of obscuring matter close to the x  ray source .",
    "the small fluctuations of the measured galactic absorption along the orbital phase , which seem to be statistically significant for the intervals a3 and a4 ( see tab .",
    "3 ) , can be caused by fluctuations in the density ( and/or in the ionization level ) of this excess of matter around the system .",
    "we fitted the continuum using a comptonization model .",
    "the values of the seed  photon and electron temperatures with respect to the orbital phase are plotted in figure 2 ( upper and middle panel , respectively ) .",
    "the spectra a1 , f and g require in addition a partial covering component to fit an iron edge at 7.67.9 kev .",
    "an absorption edge from ionized iron is present in spectra a4 , b , c and e. in spectrum d the addition of this component is not statistically significant and we find only an upper limit for its optical depth . the unabsorbed flux , extrapolated in the band 0.1100 kev , is reported in figure 3 . in this figure we marked the corresponding eddington flux for a neutron star of @xmath35 at a distance of 5.5 kpc .",
    "the flux seems to be super  eddington at the orbital phases 00.2 and 0.951 ( near the periastron phase ) .    for each spectrum we calculated the radius , @xmath36 , of the seed - photon wien spectrum using the parameters reported in tables 3 and 4 . assuming a spherical geometry , this radius can be expressed as @xmath37 km ( in t zand et _ al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , where @xmath38 is the distance to the source in kpc , @xmath39 is the unabsorbed flux of the comptonization spectrum in erg @xmath9 s@xmath1 , @xmath40 is the seed  photon temperature in kev , and @xmath41 is the relative energy gain due to the comptonization .",
    "the obtained radii , which are reported in tables 3 and 4 , are in the range between 60 and 120 km . for the sake of clarity @xmath36",
    "is also plotted versus the orbital phase in figure 2 ( lower panel ) .",
    "following iaria et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we interpret this radius as the inner radius of the disk .",
    "tennant ( 1987 ) , using exosat data , and shirey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , using rxte data , observed the presence of a qpo at frequencies between 100 and 200 hz in cir x1 .",
    "this qpo has been tentatively identified with the lower khz qpo based on the observed correlations among the qpo frequencies in ns lmxbs and black hole binary systems ( psaltis , belloni , & van der klis 1999 ) , although the interpretation of this feature needs to be confirmed .",
    "however , we observe that assuming that the frequencies of this qpo are related to the keplerian velocity of the plasma in the accretion disk , we deduce that the corresponding radii are between 60 and 120 km , similar to the obtained radius of the seed  photon emitting region .",
    "note also that the other luminous low mass x ",
    "ray binaries ( lmxbs ) of the z  class show a radius of the seed ",
    "photon emitting region much closer to the neutron star radius as compared to cir x1 ( see di salvo et al .",
    ", 2000 ; di salvo et al . , 2001 ) , and , accordingly , these z sources present qpos at khz frequencies in their power spectra . note , however , that interpreting the seed - photon radius as the inner radius of the disk would imply a quite high accretion rate through the disk of @xmath42 g / s , i.e.  @xmath18 times the eddington accretion rate , for @xmath43 km and @xmath44 kev .    a possibility to explain the large seed  photon radius in cir x1 is the presence of a relatively large magnetic field : we obtain a strength of the magnetic field in cir  x1 of @xmath45 g , assuming that the measured seed - photon radius is the magnetospheric radius .",
    "this strength is one order of magnitude higher than the supposed magnetic field for lmxbs of the z class .",
    "moreover , the interpretation of @xmath36 as the magnetospheric radius would imply lower values of @xmath36 at higher flux levels , that is not observed ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , although the error bars are large especially at phases between 0.3 and 0.9 .",
    "another possibility to explain the large value of the seed ",
    "photon radius is that the inner region of the disk is not directly visible , for the presence of optically thick material in the central part of the system , such as the optically thick corona that probably produces the comptonization spectrum , or it is absent , because , for instance , its matter is expelled in a jet or wind .",
    "we observe that the seed ",
    "photon radius seems to increase during the flaring activity at the orbital phase between 0 and 0.2 .",
    "we could suppose that because of the high ( probably super  eddington ) accretion rate , a shock is produced in the inner region of the system , pushing the accreting matter towards the external regions .",
    "a similar scenario was proposed by haynes et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , who explained the observed radio flares at the periastron as coming from a shock front formed by the super  eddington accretion . also , as cir  x1 is thought to be observed at a high inclination ( brandt et al .",
    "1996 ) , it is possible that the optically thick material at the shock intercepts and reprocesses the radiation from the inner regions , which can therefore not be directly observed",
    ".    the comptonized spectrum could originate in an accretion disk corona ( adc ) that could be formed by evaporation of the outer layers of the disk illuminated by the emission of the central object ( white & holt , 1982 ) .",
    "the radius of the corona can be written as @xmath46 ( white & holt , 1982 ) , where @xmath47 is the mass of the compact object , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are mass and radius of the sun , and @xmath50 is the adc temperature in units of @xmath51 k. under this hypothesis , using the values reported in tables 3 and 4 , we find that the radius of the adc , @xmath52 , varies along the orbit in the interval @xmath53 km",
    ". we can infer the density of the adc using the relation @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the optical depth obtained from the fit , @xmath56 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath57 is the number of particles per unit volume and @xmath52 is the adc radius calculated above .",
    "note that we are considering @xmath57 constant along the radius of the corona , that is a rough approximation . under",
    "this hypothesis @xmath57 varies between @xmath58 @xmath59 .",
    "these are typical values of density for an adc ( vrtilek et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "we observe that the electron temperature increases in the orbital phase interval 0.20.9 while it decreases in 0.91 and 00.1 .",
    "this behavior can be due to the fact that at orbital phase 0.9 the the accretion rate increases and consequently the inner temperature of the accretion disk increases ( as is seen in fig .",
    "2 , upper panel ) . the injection of more soft photons in the corona enhances the compton cooling and the electron temperature decreases . in the orbital interval 00.2 the radiation pressure moves the shock to @xmath60 km , the seed  photon temperature decreases , and so does the electron temperature .",
    "after , at orbital interval 0.20.9 , the injection of soft photons decreases , the cooling of the corona becames less efficient and the electron temperature increases .    an iron emission line at energies 6.66.8 kev is present in some spectra ( a2 , a3 , a4 , c , d and e ) , corresponding to emission from fe xxiii  xxv",
    ". the equivalent width of the line is @xmath61 ev .",
    "we have investigated the hypothesis that this emission line could be produced by reprocessing of x ",
    "rays , coming from the corona or the inner part of the system , by the disk surface ( e.g.  brandt & matt , 1994 ) . if cir x1 is observed at high inclination ( as suggested by brandt et al .",
    "1996 ) an iron emission line at @xmath62 kev could be produced by the mechanism described above , but the corresponding equivalent width should be @xmath63 ev and the width of the line , @xmath64 , between 0.60.8 kev ( see fig . 2 , 3 , and 4 in brandt & matt , 1994 ) .",
    "the predicted equivalent width seems too low to explain the observed line in cir x1 .",
    "therefore , in agreement with chandra results ( brandt & schulz 2000 ) we will consider in the following that the iron emission line is produced in a outflow of ionized matter from the accretion disk ( see below ) .      in this section",
    "we summarize our interpretation of the spectral evolution of cir x1 along the orbit based on the results from the analysis described above , as well as the bepposax results ( iaria et al . , 2001 ) , the chandra results ( brandt & schulz , 2000 ) and the detection in ir and optical bands of emission lines along the orbital period of the source ( johnston et al . , 1999 ) .    the broader component of the h@xmath12 emission line , observed along the whole orbit of the source , can be interpreted as produced in an outflow of matter with a velocity of @xmath13 km s@xmath1 ( johnston et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "this detection gives us the information that an outflow of matter , from the compact system , is present in cir x1 .",
    "the lack of the red wing of the line is associated to an optically thick outflow .",
    "chandra satellite observed , near the periastron ( phase @xmath65 ) , the presence of discrete features with p ",
    "cygni profiles in the x  ray band ( brandt & schulz , 2000 ) .",
    "the inferred velocity of the outflow is again @xmath13 km s@xmath1 , in agreement with the results of the ir observations .",
    "moreover , the fact that p ",
    "cygni profiles are observed for fe xxiv and other highly ionized elements , suggests that the matter in the outflow at the periastron phase is highly ionized .",
    "iaria et al .",
    "( 2001 ) observed near the periastron ( phase @xmath66 ) the presence of an absorption edge at energy @xmath5 kev corresponding to highly ionized iron .",
    "brandt & schulz ( 2000 ) argue that the absorption edge could be associated to the outflow , probably consisting of a thermally driven wind formed by the x  rays from the inner region which heat the disk surface .",
    "it is not straightforward to infer the geometry ( radial or vertical ) of the outflow from these data .",
    "however , we can see that the model of thermally driven wind proposed by begelman et al .",
    "( 1983 ) could explain the observed outflow .",
    "in this model the outflow is near the disk surface and mainly in the direction of the observer ( begelman et al .",
    "1983 ; begelman & mckee 1983 ) .",
    "this seems reasonable in the case of cir x1 given that brandt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argued that cir x1 is almost edge  on , and the p - cygni profiles ( to date the only ones observed in a lmxb ) indicate that we are observing both the approaching and the receding part of the outflow .",
    "this geometry could also explain the large optical depth of the iron absorption edge ( @xmath67 ; iaria et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "however , the model of thermally driven wind does not take into account the radiation pressure , and is valid for luminosities of a few percent of the eddington luminosity or less ( begelman et al .",
    "1983 ) , while the radiation pressure could be significant in cir x1 because of the high luminosity of the source , especially near the periastron .",
    "the study of cir x1 along the entire orbit allows to describe the evolution of the iron absorption edge and emission line present in the spectra with a scenario where an outflow from the system is almost always present , but its physical conditions change as function of the accretion rate along the orbital period . we distinguish three states of the source along the orbit :    1 .   a super  eddington state at phases 0.991 and 00.20 , when the outflow of highly ionized matter ( and probably a shock too ) is formed ; 2 .   a quiet state between 0.30.7 ,",
    "when the source has a sub  eddington luminosity and the outflow is weaker ; 3 .   a partial covering state between 0.770.95 , when the atmosphere of the companion star and/or the accreting matter from the companion , which probably forms a bulge in the outer disk , partially cover the emission from the compact object .",
    "the spectra a2 , a3 , a4 and b belong to the same state of the source , corresponding to the phase interval around the periastron , 0.991 and 00.2 . in these spectra",
    "there is not evidence of partial covering , suggesting the absence of neutral matter around the system ( contrarily to what is observed at previous orbital phases , between 0.780.96 , see below ) .",
    "the flux is super ",
    "eddington for each spectrum , for the assumed distance and in the hypothesis that the emission from the source is mainly isotropic . in this state probably",
    "a shock forms in the inner region of the system , and radio and x  ray flares might be associated to the shock front ( haynes et al .",
    "cygni profiles observed by brandt & schulz ( 2000 ) could be produced by the high luminosity ( and then the high radiation pressure ) that sweeps away and ionizes the accreting matter around the system . in spectra a2 and a3",
    "we do not detect the absorption edge , but an iron emission line is present at energy @xmath68 kev ( produced by fe xxiii , turner et al .",
    "1992 ) and @xmath62 kev ( fe xxiv  fe xxv ) , respectively , implying a gradual increase of the ionization level in the outflow .",
    "the equivalent width of the iron energy line at @xmath69 kev is @xmath14 ev , that is smaller than the equivalent width of the iron emission line in the other spectra , probably because the fluorescence yield associated to fe xxiii is smaller than that associated to fe xxiv and fe xxv ( turner et al , 1992 ) . in the hypothesis that the iron emission line is associated to the outflow , we deduce that also during intervals a2 and a3 the matter in the outflow is highly ionized .",
    "we argue that the outflow has a low density at these orbital phases because the absorption edge is not observed ( the corresponding equivalent hydrogen column is lower than @xmath70 @xmath9 ) . the presence of the h@xmath12 line , detected at these phases by johnston et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , suggests that the matter of the outflow is either photoionized or heated by a non thermal emission .",
    "in fact , if the matter in the outflow would be heated by a thermal emission , we should not observe an h@xmath12 emission , because recombination to neutral hydrogen should not be possible .    in spectra a4 and b ( orbital phase 0.050.19 )",
    "an absorption edge is present .",
    "the energy of the edge is 8.46 kev and 8.71 kev , respectively .",
    "these energies are compatible with iron ionization levels of fe xxiii  xxv ( turner et _ al .",
    "the best fit value for the optical depth @xmath71 , considering the photoionization cross section for the k  shell of fe xxiii ( krolik & kallman , 1987 ) and assuming cosmic abundance of iron , corresponds to a hydrogen column density of @xmath72 @xmath9 and @xmath73 @xmath9 for a4 and b respectively , in agreement with the results reported by iaria et al .",
    "the iron ionization level is similar to that in spectra a2 and a3 and the presence of the edge could be explained by an increase of the density and/or optical depth of the outflow .",
    "the iron emission line is still observed in spectrum a4 ( together with the absorption edge ) , but it is not detected is spectrum b.      the spectra c , d and e , corresponding to the orbital phase 0.30.6 , show a sub  eddington flux : the lightcurve is quite constant at @xmath74 counts s@xmath1 and the hardness ratio increases from @xmath75 up to 0.9 .",
    "photon radius is constant at @xmath76 km , the seed  photon temperature is constant at @xmath77 kev , while the electron temperature increases from 1.2 kev up to 1.5 kev . in these spectra",
    "an absorption edge is present at @xmath78 kev , with optical depth decreasing from 0.12 to 0.06 .",
    "the energy of @xmath6 kev indicates that the matter is less ionized and the low values of the optical depth indicate that the absorption column decreases .",
    "the equivalent hydrogen column goes from @xmath79 @xmath9 down to @xmath80 @xmath9 .",
    "an iron emission line is also present , the energy of which is stable at @xmath62 kev .",
    "this indicates that the outflow is still present , although it is now probably much weaker .",
    "cir x1 has a highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath81 ; murdin et al . , 1980 ; tauris et al , 1999 ) .",
    "it is possible that , for the geometry of the system ( see e.g. fig . 4 in johnston et al . , 1999 )",
    ", near the periastron , the neutron star is occulted by the outer layers of the companion - star atmosphere .",
    "also , the high eccentricity of the orbit might produce large tidal interactions at these phases , which expand and/or deform the stream of the accreting matter , maybe forming a bulge in the outer accretion disk .",
    "the excess of neutral matter modifies the observed emission of the x - ray source , producing a partial covering of the energy spectrum of the source ( see also inoue 1989 ) .",
    "the partial covering component is detected in spectra a1 , f and g , corresponding to the phase interval between 0.78 and 0.97 . in this state the ( ionized ) iron absorption edge and emission line are not detected . at orbital phase",
    "@xmath82 the hydrogen column , inferred by the partial covering , is @xmath83 @xmath9 , and it increases up to @xmath84 @xmath9 at the orbital phase @xmath85 .",
    "this is probably due to the approach of the x - ray source to the companion star . at 0.95",
    "the hydrogen column decreases to @xmath86 @xmath9 , and the partial covering component disappears at following orbital phases .",
    "the decrease of the hydrogen column can be caused by the increase of the accretion rate to super ",
    "eddington values , which photoionizes the surrounding neutral matter .",
    "in fact the x - ray flux increases from spectrum f to spectrum g ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , indicating that the accretion rate increases at these phases .",
    "recently several z  sources were analysed using a broad band ( 0.1200 kev ) energy range ( e.g. gx 17 + 2 , di salvo et al . , 2000 ;",
    "gx 349 + 2 , di salvo et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "their spectra show an absorption edge associated to highly ionized matter , as it is observed in cir x1 .",
    "the hydrogen column associated to the absorption edge in these z  sources is @xmath87 @xmath9 and the equivalent widths of the iron emission line present in these spectra are @xmath88 ev .",
    "these equivalent widths , according to vrtilek et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who suppose that emission lines are produced in a photoionized adc , could be expected in sources with a low inclination angle .",
    "the phenomenon of the outflow from the accretion disk connected to eddington ",
    "sources is partially confirmed by the detection , in ir band , of lines with p ",
    "cygni profiles in sco x1 and gx 13 + 1 ( bandyopadhyay et al . , 1999 ) . because the outflow of ionized matter should be mostly along the disk surface",
    ", the absorption edge should be more evident in sources with high inclination .",
    "therefore the small values of the optical depth of the absorption edge in gx 17 + 2 and gx 349 + 2 could be associated to low inclinations . in this case",
    "the absorption edge might be considered an indicator of the inclination angle of the source .",
    "we have analyzed observations of cir x1 from asca archive , performed in 1998 march and corresponding to a whole orbital period .",
    "cir x1 is most probably a high inclination source , and this might explain why we do not observe the blackbody emission of the neutron star or inner accretion disk .",
    "we observe a comptonized component probably coming from a adc .",
    "we find that the optical depth of the comptonizing region is @xmath63 , the seed  photon temperature ranges from 0.4 to 0.5 kev , the electron temperature increases from 1 kev at phase 0.05 up to 1.8 kev at phase 0.9 .",
    "the radius of the seed photons is around 90 km .",
    "this could be explained either by a magnetic field of @xmath89 g or , more probably , by the presence of optically thick material in the inner part of the system which hides the innermost regions . during the observations , which span an entire orbital period of the x - ray source",
    ", it is possible to distinguish three states of the source : a high - accretion rate ( probably super  eddington ) state , where x  ray flares are present , near the periastron ; a quiet state , where the system accretes at a sub  eddington rate , at orbital phases from 0.3 to @xmath90 , and a partial covering state , at orbital phases 0.780.97 .",
    "the first state is characterized by the presence of a prominent iron absorption edge , probably produced in an outflow of highly ionized matter .",
    "the matter is swept away and photoionized by the high luminosity of the x - ray source in this state .",
    "the second state shows an absorption edge of less ionized iron with an equivalent hydrogen column smaller than @xmath70 @xmath9 ; the outflow is probably still present in this state , although much weaker .",
    "the third state is characterized by the presence of partial covering , explained as due to absorption by the atmosphere of the companion star and/or by the accreting matter from the companion , which , at these orbital phases , can fall in the line of sight between the x - ray source and the observer .",
    "this work was supported by the italian space agency ( asi ) , by the ministero della ricerca scientifica e tecnologica ( murst ) .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
