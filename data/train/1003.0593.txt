    "very often , however , this information is not sufficient and it is also required to know _ how much _ a state is entangled . a useful tool to quantify the amount of entanglement of a state is given by the so - called entanglement measures  @xcite . a widely used such measure is provided by the geometric measure of entanglement that is defined for a pure state @xmath1 by  @xcite @xmath2 where the maximum is taken over all separable pure states .",
    "the extension to mixed states is done via the usual convex - roof construction  @xcite .",
    "the geometric measure fulfills all the requirements of an entanglement monotone  @xcite and is comprised between 0 and 1 .",
    "while the lower value is realized for separable states , the upper value is never reached because that would imply having a state orthogonal to all separable states and this is simply impossible .",
    "the geometric measure of entanglement has been shown to have several operational interpretations , on one side in terms of the utility of a state as an initial state for the grover algorithm  @xcite , and on the other side in terms of the difficulty of state discrimination under local operations and classical communications ( locc )  @xcite .",
    "it is also related to optimal entanglement witnesses  @xcite and has nice applications in many - body physics and condensed matter systems  @xcite .    despite its usefulness ,",
    "the explicit value of the geometric measure of entanglement has only been derived , so far , for a limited number of entangled states , such as @xmath0-qubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states  @xcite , dicke states  @xcite , generalized @xmath3-states  @xcite , graph states  @xcite , or other typical states with given symmetry properties  @xcite .",
    "the geometric measure remains unknown for most of the multipartite states simply because of the definition that involves an optimization procedure over the class of separable states and this represents a formidable task in the general case even with numerical approaches .",
    "a very recent study showed , however , that this task is drastically simplified in the case of states that are symmetric under any permutation of the parties  @xcite . in that case",
    "the optimization can be done on the restricted set of symmetric separable states @xmath4 .",
    "this represents a huge simplification in the calculation of the geometric measure since the number of parameters involved in the optimization procedure does not depend on the number of parties anymore . for qubit systems ,",

    "in an @xmath0-qubit system , an arbitrary symmetric state is conveniently represented in either the majorana  @xcite or the dicke state  @xcite representation . in the majorana representation , any symmetric state @xmath5 is univocally specified by @xmath0 single - qubit states @xmath6",

    "in the majorana representation , the dicke states correspond to @xmath20 points at the north pole ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath17 points at the south pole of the bloch sphere .    in the dicke state representation , any symmetric state @xmath5",

    "( [ psisym ] ) is obtained through the relation  @xcite @xmath25 inversely , the majorana representation of a symmetric state expressed in the dicke state basis is obtained with @xmath0 single - qubit @xmath26 states defined by @xmath27 equal to the @xmath28 roots of the polynomial @xmath29 , @xmath28 being the polynomial degree and the remaining @xmath30 equal to 1  @xcite .",

    "various configurations of symmetric states are identified with that behavior .",
    "the geometric measure of entanglement of an @xmath0-qubit symmetric state @xmath5 necessarily verifies @xmath39    equation  ( [ upperbound ] ) is immediately obtained from the representation of the identity in the @xmath40-dimensional subspace of symmetric states as a combination of all projectors onto the symmetric separable states @xmath41  @xcite  : @xmath42 where the single - qubit state @xmath43 is parametrised by the two angles ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) according to @xmath46 .",

    "although the calculation of the geometric measure of entanglement is greatly simplified for the particular case of @xmath0-qubit symmetric states , the quest of the states in the symmetric subspace having the highest geometric entanglement remains a task that can not be solved analytically in the general @xmath0 case .",

    "the maximum with respect to variation of the non - negative @xmath132 occurs when all but one are equal to zero .",
    "the problem thus reduces to finding the largest overlap of the fixed @xmath47 with a coherent state , and eq .   becomes @xmath134",
