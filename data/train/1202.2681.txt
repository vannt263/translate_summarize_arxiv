    "pairing is essential to the global description of nuclear ground - state and low excited state properties ; the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) and hartree - fock augmented by bcs ( hf+bcs ) theories are in common use to treat the pairing degrees of freedom @xcite .",

    "particles can be reflected from the edges of the box and obscure this measure of evaporation , so we have to add an absorbing potential @xmath111 near the edges . as mentioned in ref .",

    "one should not expect close agreement under all conditions for two reasons .",
    "the total emission probability in the final state can be calculated easily in the schrdinger dynamics by taking the overlap of the initial state with the bound solutions .",
    "the tdhfb dynamics on the other hand may have no binding when the average particle number on the nucleus becomes small .",
    "it is also not possible to set the initial conditions for the hfb wave function to correspond exactly to the two - particle wave function of the schrdinger equation ; one sees this already in fig .",
    "2 . as described above , the initial state for the schrdinger equation is squeezed ground state , namely the lowest state of the two - particle system in the presence of a harmonic external potential .",
    "a corresponding hfb wave function could be constructed by using the bcs form of the wave function and requiring that it have the same one - particle density matrix .",
    "this turns out to not work well , due to high momentum components in the wave function that are not properly controlled by the hfb pairing field .",
    "we found that a better prescription is to make a corresponding squeezed ground state in the hfb treatment .",
    "we use this prescription for the comparison shown below .",

    "results with different two - body interaction strengths ( case ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) ) are respectively shown from top to bottom ( see text ) . ]    in the case ( a ) and ( b ) , tdhf and tdhfb are identical .",
    "indeed , the minimization of hfb equation to get the initial state leads to a pure slater determinant state . in these case",
    ", the tdhf evolution is very close to the exact solution .",
    "note that , in this regime , the evaporation is dominated by the mean - field contribution and pairing has a weak effect on particle emission . as the interaction strength increases ,",
    "the tdhfb and tdhf results starts to deviate from each other as well as from the exact evolution .",
    "a precise study of the strongest coupling case ( case ( c ) ) , which is the only case above the hfb threshold for the initial state , shows that the time scale associated to particle evaporation is properly accounted for in tdhfb .",
    "this could indeed be seen in bottom part of figure [ fig : n2 ] where we see that the time at which @xmath127 starts to decrease is the same in the exact and in the tdhfb case .",
    "this shows that the time - scale associated with the evaporation process is the same in the exact and tdhfb case . in the long time",
    "limit , tdhfb overestimates the average number of emitted particles .",
    "accordingly , it could be anticipated that the internal motion of the system is more damped in the latter case than in reality .",
    "we indeed have checked that the damping width of the monopole resonance is larger in tdhfb compared to the exact solution .",
    "it should be noted that the approximation leading to tdhfb can only be justified for the short - time evolution .",

    "are shown in the bottom part . ]",
    "starting from the expression ( [ eq : contbcs ] ) derived for tdhf+bcs , the evolution of particle number inside the box is given by @xmath145 introducing two sets of real functions @xmath146 and @xmath147 for each wave - packet such that : @xmath148 and making use of partial integration technique , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : contbcs2 ] ) can be recast as : @xmath149 where @xmath150 denotes the local velocity of the particle defined through @xmath151 .",
    "this term is the expected physical term expected to appear in any well defined transport theory that relates the number of particles inside the box to the flow of particles outgoing at the boundary of the box .",
    "however , due to the presence of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : contbcs2 ] ) , oscillation of occupation numbers that are not compensated by oscillation of the probability @xmath131 ( see figure [ fig : nit ] ) lead to spurious behavior of the particle number .",
    "the only way out to avoid this problem in a tdhf+bcs approach is to freeze the occupation numbers during the evolution .      to incorporate pairing in a transport model we are facing the difficulty that the tdhfb theory is very demanding numerically .",
    "a possible solution to this difficulty , would be to use the simpler tdhf+bcs approach .",
    "however , in view of preceding sections , the approximation made to obtain tdhf+bcs leads to unphysical behavior especially when continuum plays a significant role : strange behavior of particle emission , gas problem .",
    "we have seen in section [ sec : spurious ] , that the pathologies of tdhf+bcs comes from the evolution of occupation that should normally be accompanied by a consistent mixing of the single - particle states along the dynamical path .",
    "this approximation does not seem to be critical in the study of static properties of nuclei and most often , for not too exotic nuclei , bcs theory provides a fairly good approximation to hfb .",
    "a simple prescription to avoid non - physical evolution in tdhf+bcs is to assume that the occupation numbers are frozen during the time - evolution , this approximation is called hereafter _",
    "frozen occupation approximation _ ( foa ) .",
    "an illustration of the foa effect on particle evaporation is shown in figure [ fig : p2_ni_cst_bcs ] ( dashed line ) .     particles .",
    "the exact result ( thick solid line ) is compared to the tdhf+bcs with ( dashed line ) and without ( thin solid line ) the frozen occupation number approximation .",
    "the simulation has been made with the same parameters set as the lower panel of figure [ fig : n2 ] . ]    as anticipated , spurious oscillations of the particle number evaporation disappear in the foa .",
    "it turns out , that , for the specific set of parameters used in the example of figure [ fig : n2 ] , the asymptotic number of particle evaporated is in very good agreement with the exact case , much better than the tdhfb solution ( see figure [ fig : n2 ] ) .",
    "however , the agreement depends on the parameters that are used and not systematic conclusion can be drawn .",
    "note that this approximation has already been used in realistic calculation for example to study dipole giant resonances @xcite .",
    "in this article , different transport theories able to incorporate pairing are discussed .",
    "one important conclusion is that theories like tdhf+bcs where the continuity equation is not respected can lead to unphysical results .",
    "more specifically , the effect of pairing on particle emission has been analyzed here using a simple one - dimensional hamiltonian that can be solved exactly for the case of two particles . from the systematic study we have made by changing the interaction strength and/or particle number ,",
    "pairing does affect significantly the particle number emission . while the tdhf approach generally underestimate significantly",
    "the number of emitted particles , an enhancement of particle evaporation is observed when pairing is included .",
    "this effect is automatically included in both tdhfb or tdhf+bcs theory .",
    "only tdhfb provides a good description of particle emission at short time but might deviates from the exact dynamics at longer time due to accumulated correlation effects beyond this approach .",
    "while the asymptotic number of emitted particles is quite reasonable , tdhf+bcs leads to unphysical rapid emission and spurious oscillations of the number of emitted particles . the direct use of tdhf+bcs , that would be highly desirable from the practical point of view , is plagued with unphysical behavior , and , as we have shown , it is preferable to use a simplified version where occupation numbers are frozen to their initial value .    in summary , both tdhfb and tdhf+bcs with constant occupation numbers can eventually be used to describe a physical system while tdhf+bcs with varying occupation numbers should be avoided . while tdhfb is expected to have a reacher dynamics , due to its simplicity , the second transport theory remains quite attractive .",
