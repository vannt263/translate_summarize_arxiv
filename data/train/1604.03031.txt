    "barium stars are a family of peculiar red giants whose envelopes exhibit overabundance of carbon , as well as of elements heavier than iron .",
    "first recognized by bidelman & keenan ( 1951 ) , these objects show strong lines of the s - process elements , particularly baii at 4554 and srii at 4077 , and ch , cn , and c@xmath1 molecular bands .",
    "the elements heavier than iron are synthesized in the interior of agb ( asymptotic giant branch ) stars through the slow neutron capture process ( s - process ) , a neutron - capture chain starting on fe seed nuclei and synthesizing nuclides heavier than fe located along the valley of nuclear stability ( burbidge et al .",
    "1957 ) . as a result of the so - called `` third dredge - up ''",
    ", the s - process enriched material is brought to the surface of the agb stars ( iben & renzini 1983 ; busso et al .",
    "2001 ) . until the discovery of the binary nature of the barium stars through radial velocity monitoring ( mcclure et al .",
    "1980 ) , the origin of the s - process enhancements observed in these stars presented a fundamental challenge to the stellar nucleosynthesis theory and to post - main - sequence evolution , because barium stars are not luminous enough to have undergone third dredge - ups on the agb . since barium stars have low luminosities @xmath2@xmath3 ( jaschek et al .",
    "1985 ) , and stars on the thermally pulsing phase have luminosities @xmath2@xmath4 to @xmath55.0 ( iben & renzini 1983 ) , the chemical peculiarities observed in the barium stars can only be attributed to mass transfer in the binary system from an agb star ( now the white dwarf ) .",
    "in fact , as showed by mcclure ( 1983 ) , 85% of the barium stars are binary stars .",
    "those that are considered a single star can be actually related to binary systems where the orbits are either pole - on , or they are very eccentric and significant variations of radial velocity occur only in a small phase range , like hd 123949 whose period is 9200 days and has an eccentricity of 0.972 ( pourbaix et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the barium star phenomenon was also detected in other peculiar binary systems , where the observed overabundances of the s - process elements are due to the mass - transfer hypothesis .",
    "this is the case of the ch stars ( luck & bond 1991 ) , yellow - symbiotic stars ( smith et al 1996 ; pereira & roig 2009 ) , binary planetary nebulae such as abel 35 and lotr5 ( thvenin & jasniewicz 1997 ) , and cemp - s stars ( sivarani et al . 2004 ) .",
    "since the barium stars are warmer than the agb stars with temperatures below 3500k , they are free from the strong molecular opacity caused by zro , cn , and c@xmath1 bands absorption features , which complicate the analysis and the abundance determinations based on atomic lines . therefore , the barium stars become very useful targets where the abundances of several elements of the s - process can be determined by measuring equivalent widths of their lines .",
    "this probably explains why barium stars have attracted the attention of several astrophysicists .",
    "the number of barium stars investigated so far is still small , and some stars have been investigated more than once .",
    "recent and earlier papers devoted to obtain the abundance pattern in barium stars have been mainly interested to provide a precise diagnostic of the s - process nucleosynthesis in these stars , and also to set constraints for agb models through the determination of the [ hs / ls]@xmath6 where [ hs ] and [ ls ] are the mean abundances of the s - elements at the ba and zr peaks , respectively . ]",

    "barium stars have been also used by busso et al .",
    "( 2001 ) as a source sample of extrinsic galactic agb stars in a study that aimed to compare the observed [ hs / ls ] ratios for several classes of chemically peculiar stars ( intrinsic and extrinsic ) with that predicted by nucleosynthesis models for agb stars with different masses and metallicities . in busso et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , only 13 barium stars have been used to constrain the [ hs / ls ] ratio for the extrinsic objects .",
    "later , husti et al . (",
    "2009 ) used a more extended sample from allen & barbuy ( 2006 ) and smiljanic et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to compare the observed abundances with their agb nucleosynthesis models for different masses , metallicities and @xmath7c efficiencies .    among the chemically peculiar stars , the barium stars are probably the largest sample .",
    "han et al .",
    "( 1995 ) estimated that the number of the barium stars in our galaxy may range from 800 to 22000 for stars brighter than @xmath8=10.0 , and this includes both strong and mild barium stars .",
    "the catalog of l ( 1991 ) lists 389 barium stars including `` certain '' and `` candidates '' , and the earlier publication of macconnell et al .",
    "( 1972 ) lists 241 barium stars including `` certain '' and `` marginal '' .",
    "the quantitative confirmation of the overabundances of the s - process elements in such a large sample of barium stars would help not only to better constrain the number of `` actual '' barium stars , but would also set important constraints for the models of agb nucleosynthesis .",
    "the former data would be useful to compare with their theoretical birthrate , while the latter can be achieved , for example , by determining the [ hs / ls ] ratio ( among other things ) , and would help to answer questions like how is the behavior of the [ hs / ls ] ratio with metallicity and mass .",
    "recently , two results appeared in the literature showing that the barium star studies may still post interesting questions .",
    "the first one ( katime santrich et al . 2013 ) reports the discovery of two barium stars in the open cluster ngc 5822 , while the second one ( lebzelter et al . 2013 ) reports the discovery of two barium stars in the galactic bulge .",
    "therefore , investigating the metallicity of a large sample of barium stars , taken from different sources , makes possible to probe the s - process nucleosynthesis in different galactic populations .    aiming to assess the above issues , in 2007 we started a high - resolution spectroscopic survey of a sample of barium stars using the feros spectrograph ( although a few objects had been already observed between 1999 and 2001 ) .",
    "the majority of the observed barium stars were selected from macconnell et al .",
    "( 1972 ) , but we refer the reader to section 2 for more details on target selection .",
    "previous results from this survey include : the discovery of a new ch subgiant star bd-03@xmath93668 ( pereira & drake 2011 ) ; the analysis of a metal - poor barium star hd 10613 and the ch star bd+04@xmath92466 ( pereira & drake 2009 ) ; and the analysis of small sample of metal - rich barium stars ( pereira et al .",
    "2011 ) .    besides probing the enrichment of the s - process elements , the high - resolution spectroscopic data of a large sample of barium stars allows us to determine , among other things , the atmospheric parameters .",
    "this makes possible to compare the distributions of temperature , surface gravity , metallicity , and microturbulent velocity to other studies already done for field giant stars .",
    "then , we can investigate if the barium giant stars have similar parameters to the non - s - process enriched giant stars .",
    "the abundances of other elements besides those of the s - process , such as sodium , aluminum , @xmath10-elements ( mg , si , ca , and ti ) and iron peak elements ( cr and ni ) can also be obtained .",
    "this , in turn , would rise the question on whether the abundances of barium stars are similar to those of the field giants with equal metallicities . from the surface gravity and temperature , and using evolutionary tracks and isochrones , the masses and ages of the barium stars can be determined too .",
    "in addition , the spectroscopic distance , obtained from the ionization equilibrium using the abundances of the fei and feii lines , allows us to determine the luminosity of these stars and their scale height .",
    "luminosity is a key parameter to discuss the origin of overabundances of the elements of the s - process .",
    "we can also obtain the radial velocities of the stars in our sample , measuring doppler shifts of some absorption lines .",
    "combining the radial velocities , distances , and knowing the proper motions , it is possible to determine the spatial velocities and to set a kinematical constraint for a given population .",
    "the determination of the kinematics , the metallicity , and the mean abundance of @xmath10-elements provide another important check on whether a correlation between abundances and kinematics holds for the barium stars .",
    "finally , we can also search for technetium lines in the spectra of the more evolved stars .    in this work we observed and analyzed 182 stars among `` certain '' and `` candidate '' barium stars .",
    "our results are all based on the measurement of equivalent widths .",
    "the number of fei and feii absorption lines used was about 22000 . to determine the abundances of the other elements , the number of absorption lines used was about 33000 . in sect .",

    "5 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the majority of the barium stars analyzed in this work were selected from macconnell et al .",
    "( 1972 ) , 109 stars out of 151 ( 72% ) from his tablei ( `` certain baii stars '' ) , and 54 stars out of 90 ( 60% ) from his table ii ( `` marginal baii stars '' ) .",
    "marginal barium stars from table ii of macconnell et al .",
    "( 1972 ) were included in our study because we need to determine their heavy - element abundance in order to reveal how strong is the degree of s - process enrichment in these stars .",
    "this group of marginal stars represents an interesting target to study the nucleosynthesis of the s - process , since some metal - rich and s - process enriched stars have already been found among them ( pereira et al .",
    "other barium stars were selected from other sources .",
    "we included in our analysis 12 out of 15 stars classified as `` baii '' by bidelman ( 1981 ) , and two stars from luck & bond ( 1991 ) : bd+09@xmath92384 and hd 89638 .    some halo stars that are not included in the references above",
    "were selected from two other sources that analyzed a large sample of barium stars using previous hipparcos astrometric and radial velocity data . in particular , we selected four halo candidate stars , bd-01@xmath9302 , hd 749 , hd 88927 , and hd 211211 , from gmez et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and another candidate halo star , hd 187762 , was taken from mennessier et al .",
    "these latter authors list 20 candidate halo stars , but we selected only one because several stars in their sample have been recognized later as dwarf barium stars , or we already selected them from macconnell et al .",
    "although gmez et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and mennessier et al .",
    "( 1997 ) analyzed 318 and 296 stars , respectively , taken from l ( 1991 ) , some of theses stars may not be barium stars according to jorissen et al .",
    "this is because no heavy - element overabundances have been found in some of them after the high - resolution analysis of mcwilliam ( 1990 ) .",
    "for this reason , we decided to select targets mainly from sources other than of l ( 1991 ) .    our sample",
    "is then constituted of 182 stars , among certain barium stars and candidates .",
    "they are listed in table 1 , where the last column indicates the source from which they have been selected . throughout this work",
    ", we present our results following the same order given in table 1 , except for table 16 where we separate the stars according to their kinematical properties .",
    "the high - resolution spectra of the barium stars analyzed in this work were obtained with the feros ( fiberfed extended range optical spectrograph ) spectrograph ( kaufer et al . 1999 ) , installed at the 1.52 m and 2.2 m telescopes of eso at la silla ( chile ) .",
    "data was obtained during several observing runs performed between 1999 and 2010 .",
    "feros has a spectral resolving power of @xmath11 with a wavelength coverage from 3800 to 9200 .",
    "the spectra were reduced with the midas pipeline reduction package , consisting of the following standard steps : ccd bias correction , flat - fielding , spectrum extraction , wavelength calibration and correction of barycentric velocity .",
    "table 1 provides the log of observations and information about the @xmath8-magnitude , spectral types , and exposure times .",
    "the @xmath8-magnitudes and spectral types were taken from the simbad database .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the spectra of four very s - process enriched barium stars .",
    "the absorption lines of fei and feii , as well as of other elements selected in this study , were the same used in previous studies dedicated to the analysis of photospheric abundances of some barium giants .",
    "the equivalent widths were measured by fitting gaussian profiles to the observed profiles .",
    "the @xmath12 values for the fei and feii lines were taken from lambert et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and castro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in table 2",
    ", we show our fe i and feii lines list used for the determination of the atmospheric parameters .",
    "only the lines with equivalent widths between 10m and 150m were used in the determination of atmospheric parameters .",
    "we recall that the determination of the stellar atmospheric parameters , such as effective temperature ( @xmath13 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath14 ) , microturbulence ( @xmath15 ) , and metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) ( we use the notation [ x / h]=@xmath16 ) are mandatory for the determination of photospheric abundances .",
    "the atmospheric parameters were determined using the lte ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) model atmospheres of kurucz ( 1993 ) , and the code of spectral analysis moog ( sneden 1973 ) .",
    "the solution of excitation equilibrium used to derive the effective temperature ( @xmath13 ) was defined by a zero slope of the trend between the iron abundances derived from fei lines and the excitation potential of the measured lines .",
    "the microturbulent velocity ( @xmath15 ) was found by constraining the abundance , determined from individual fei lines , to show no dependence on reduced equivalent width ( @xmath17 ) . as a by - product , this yields the metallicity , [ fe / h ] , of the star .",
    "the value of @xmath14 was determined by means of the ionization balance using the assumption of lte , that is , the gravity is determined by forcing the fei and feii lines to yield the same iron abundance at the selected effective temperature .",
    "the adopted atmospheric parameters are given in table  3 .",
    "we also show the number of the fei and fe ii lines employed for the determination .",
    "the error in our adopted effective temperatures ( @xmath13 ) and microturbulent velocity ( @xmath15 ) was set from the uncertainty in the slope of the fei abundance _ versus _ excitation potential and _ versus _ @xmath17 . for the gravity ,",
    "the error in this parameter is estimated until the difference between the mean abundances of fei and feii differ by 1@xmath18 of the standard deviation of the [ fei / h ] mean value .",
    "we noticed that the cooler stars of our sample ( stars with temperatures between 4100k and 4500k ) give larger errors in the temperature than the hotter stars ( stars with temperatures between 5000k and 5400k ) .",
    "for these cooler stars we found a mean error of 120@xmath1950k while for those hotter stars we found a mean error of 90@xmath1920k .",
    "the reason for this difference is that cooler stars gives higher abundance uncertainties since they have higher uncertainty in the continuum placement which affects the measurement of the equivalent widths .",
    "the classification of a star as a barium star can be confirmed only after the determination of the heavy - element abundance . of the 182 stars",
    "initially selected , 13 were later rejected because their mean s - process elements abundances in the notation [ s / fe ] ( see section 4.3 for the definition of [ s / fe ] ) were similar to those of the field giants .",

    ", we list the values of the mean and standard deviation resulting from these gaussian fits , as well as the simple mean of each histogram .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows that the metallicity distribution of the barium stars involves two gaussian components : a major peak corresponding to the thin disk , and a smaller peak that corresponds to the thick disk .",
    "the corresponding mean metallicities are @xmath50.12@xmath190.14 and @xmath50.49@xmath190.09 , respectively ( table 4 ) .",
    "these values are similar to those found by schuster et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in their photometric analysis of disk and halo stars .",
    "these authors found a mean metallicity of @xmath50.16@xmath190.14 for the thin disk , and a mean metallicity of @xmath50.55@xmath190.18 for the thick disk .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the distribution of surface gravity for the field giants and barium giants .",
    "the barium giants display three peaks in the distribution : one peak at @xmath14=2.45 , another peak at @xmath14=1.60 , and a third one at @xmath14=1.17 . on the other hand , the field giants",
    "are represented by only one broad gaussian distribution , with a standard deviation of 0.42 .",
    "table 4 shows the mean and tstandard deviations of the three distributions that fit @xmath14 for the barium giants , and the mean and standard deviation of the fit for the field giants .",
    "the peak at @xmath14= 1.60 is due to the presence of several barium giants with surface gravities between 1.4 and 1.8 .",
    "there are 34 ( table 3 and the star hd 206983 ; junqueira & pereira 2001 ) out of 182 barium stars in this range of @xmath14 , which represents 19% of the sample .",
    "this fraction is of only 2.5% ( 28 out of 1135 stars ) in the sample of field giants .",
    "the peak at @xmath211.2 is due to the presence of six barium stars with @xmath14 between 1.1 and 1.3 , which represents 3.0% of the sample .",
    "the field giants in the same range of surface gravity represents only 0.4% ( 5 out of 1135 stars ) .",
    "the distribution of surface gravity also reveals that the peak for the barium giants is shifted by approximately 0.3 dex towards lower values of @xmath14 in comparison to the peak of the field giants .",
    "differences in the analysis made by different authors , which include the atomic data used for the metallicity and surface gravity determination , the choice of model atmosphere grids , or even the automated placement of the continuum , may account for differences of up to 0.30.4 dex in the determination of @xmath14 and metallicity in giant stars .",
    "however , evolutionary effects should also be considered .",
    "many stars from the samples of mishenina et al .",

    "( 2008 ) are clump giants , that is , there are many stars with a @xmath14 between 2.0 and 3.0 ( figures 2 and 3a of takeda et al .",
    "2008 ) .    like the surface gravity",
    ", the peak of the distribution of metallicity of barium giants also shows a shift of ( @xmath210.1 dex ) towards lower values in comparison to the field giants .",
    "the most likely explanation for this difference is related to the systematic differences in the analysis ( see the end of this section ) .",
    "most of the previous studies of field giants used in this work to compare with the barium stars , show that they are members of the thin disk population .",
    "based on the spatial velocities , luck & heiter ( 2007 ) showed that their sample is dominated by stars from the thin disk .",
    "takeda et al . ( 2008 ) also shows that 97% of the stars in their sample also belong to thin disk .",
    "in fact , as we show in section 5.3 ( table 17 ) , these two samples have values of the mean spatial velocities @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 , @xmath22@xmath25@xmath24 , @xmath22@xmath26@xmath24 and the corresponding dispersions ( @xmath18@xmath27 , @xmath18@xmath28 , @xmath18@xmath29 ) very similar to those of the thin disk stars .    figure 3(c ) shows the distribution of temperature with two peaks in the histogram for the barium giants .",

    "the metallicity distribution showed that barium stars have one major peak at [ fe / h]=@xmath50.12 and another at [ fe / h]=@xmath50.49 . these two metalicity mean values are similar to those of the thin disk and the thick disk , respectively , according to results reported in the literature",
    ". the observed distribution of surface gravity for barium stars can be fit by three gaussians , thus indicating the presence of evolved giants among the barium stars population .",
    "the temperature distribution can be fit by two gaussians , one corresponding to the majority of the barium giants and another representing the evolved and cooler population of barium stars .",
    "the determination of the surface gravity and temperature allowed us to obtain the masses and ages of the barium stars , and to determine the relation between age and metallicity , and between age and mass .",
    "barium giant stars also follow the age - metallicity relation , i.e. younger objects are more metal rich than the older ones .",
    "they also follow the same trend between mass and age observed for the field giants by takeda et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , i.e. younger stars are more massive while older ones are less massive .    based on the ionization equilibrium we determined the surface gravities and , hence , the spectroscopic distances which enable us to determine the luminosities and scale height of the barium stars .",
    "we concluded that none of the barium giants is luminous enough to be an agb star and become self - enriched in the s - process elements .",
    "our determination of the scale height shows that barium stars have a scale height similar to the disk stars .",
    "the abundances of aluminum , @xmath10-elements and iron - peak elements of barium stars are similar to the field giants of similar metallicities .",
    "we found that some barium stars have higher sodium abundance compared to the field giant stars .",
    "this conclusion is strengthened by the anti - correlation between the [ na / fe ] ratio and surface gravity , that is , stars with lower surface gravity tend to be more sodium rich than stars with higher surface gravities .",
    "this is probably due to the production of sodium in the former agb star ( now the white dwarf ) of the binary system that transferred sodium enriched matter and/or that the barium star itself might become self enriched in sodium due to the nena cycle .    after determining the abundance of the elements created by the s - process for the 182 stars of our sample",
    ", we disregarded the `` barium star nature '' of 13 stars since they present a mean [ s / fe ] ratio similar to the non - s - process enriched field giant stars .",
    "our abundance analysis showed that heavy - element abundance pattern of barium stars showed different degrees of enrichment , considering the [ s / fe ] ratio as a diagnostic of s - process enrichment .",
    "we did not find a distinction in the [ s / fe ] ratio between our sample of barium stars and the barium giants previously analyzed in the literature .",
    "we did not find a difference of the [ s / fe ] of barium stars analyzed in this paper and that of dwarf barium stars .",
    "the [ s / fe ] and the [ hs / ls ] ratios increase as the metallicity decreases , as expected based on the theoretical models of nucleosynthesis in agb stars considering @xmath7c as the neutron source .",
    "our [ hs / ls ] ratio has a maximum value of @xmath21@xmath420.5 at a metallicity of @xmath21@xmath50.5 . using the diagram [ hs / ls ] _ versus _ [ s / fe ] ratio and dividing the stars according to their metallicities",
    ", we found that some stars may have atypical [ hs / ls ] ratios considering their metallicities .",
    "the massive stars of our sample , stars with 5.0 @xmath43 and 6.0 @xmath43 , are probably stars where the source of neutrons is @xmath44ne by the reaction @xmath44ne(@xmath10,n)@xmath45 mg .    based on the determined spectroscopic distances , the measurements of radial velocities , and using the proper motions from the literature , we determined the @xmath23 , @xmath34 and @xmath46 with their respective dispersions , as well as the spatial velocities ( @xmath40 ) of our sample of barium giants and the samples of field giants analyzed by luck & heiter ( 2007 ) and takeda et al .",
    "this analysis allowed us to obtain the probability of a star to be a member of a given population in the galaxy .",
    "our results showed that 90% of the barium stars belong to the thin disk , while for the field giants from the samples of luck & heiter ( 2007 ) and takeda et al .",
    "( 2008 ) the fraction is 98% . for the thin / thick disk and the thick disk populations , the barium stars proportionally have a much bigger population , 3.0% and 4.0% , compared to 1.0% and 0.7% for the field giants . for the thick disk / halo and halo populations , the fraction of barium stars is 3.0% compared to only 0.3% of the field giants .",
    "in addition , combining the results on spatial velocities , metallicities and [ @xmath10/fe ] ratios , we showed that barium stars follow the expected behavior in which stars with lower spatial velocities are in the thin disk while stars with higher spatial velocities are in the thick disk and the halo .",
    "metal - poor barium stars analyzed in this work also have kinematical properties of the thick disk / halo and halo populations .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that our work is far from being completed .",
    "the abundances of light elements ( carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , and lithium ) , as well as the @xmath47c/@xmath7c isotopic ratio , were not analyzed here and will be a matter of further investigation . carbon and nitrogen are very strongly affected by nuclear burning in the inner regions of the stars , such as the cno cycle and the triple-@xmath10 reaction .",
    "when the convection in the stellar envelope penetrates inwards during the stellar evolution along the giant branch , the material which has been processed in the interior is mixed to the surface .",
    "therefore , the determination of the abundances of carbon , nitrogen , lithium , and the @xmath47c/@xmath7c isotopic ratio is essential for understanding not only convection , but also to set observational constraints to the nucleosynthesis history of the stars and the current theory of stellar evolution .",
    "rubidium , lead , and europium are another interesting abundance targets",
    ". the abundance of rubidium can provide another distinction , besides the [ hs / ls ] ratio , between the high mass and the low mass barium stars .",
    "in addition , detailed nucleosynthesis models for stars with masses between 5.0 @xmath43 and 9.0 @xmath43 at solar metallicity predict [ rb/(sr , zr)]@xmath200.0 ( karakas et al .",
    "this is also a subject for future study , since it implies to analyze a large sample of the low mass barium giant stars , as well as to compare them with the high mass barium stars , in order to have a statistically significant sample .",
    "lead abundance is also important to investigate the contribution of the strong component of the s - process in a sample of chemically peculiar stars covering a wide range of metallicities .",
    "as seen in figure 22 , the abundance of the s - process elements of barium stars is similar to that of some post - agb stars .",
    "europium in some post - agb stars presents a very high [ eu / fe ] ratio ( @xmath421.55 in iras 06530@xmath50213 , and @xmath421.03 in iras 08143@xmath54406 , reyniers et al . 2004 ; @xmath42 1.33 in glmp 334 , and @xmath421.01 in iras 15482@xmath55741 , pereira et al .",
    "2012 ) , but some post - agb stars also show low [ eu / fe ] ratio as , for example , @xmath420.26 in iras 19500@xmath51709 ( van winckel & reyniers 2000 ) .",
    "europium is 94% formed by the r - process ( arlandini et al . 1999 ) , but in post - agb stars is formed by the s - process ( pereira et al . 2012 ) .",
    "therefore , the abundance of europium in a sample of barium stars will be important to check whether a similar high [ eu / fe ] ratios , like those found in post - agb stars , are detected in barium stars .",
