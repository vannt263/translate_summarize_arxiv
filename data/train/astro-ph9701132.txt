    "in this paper we address a long - standing question in stellar structure as to the locus for the onset of subsurface convection zones in main sequence stars .",
    "thirty years ago , the changeover from radiative to convective envelopes was presumed to occur in the close vicinity of spectral type f5 ( e.g. , wilson 1966 , kraft 1967 ) , an idea that was supported by optical observations of the time , which showed an absence of chromospheric emission reversals in the spectra of earlier stars and a steep falloff in the axial rotation rates of later stars ( the direct result , it was reasoned , of magnetic braking and angular momentum loss due to the onset of coronal winds ) . in later years , however , improved stellar structure models as well as x - ray and ultraviolet ( uv ) observations from space have shown that coronae , chromospheres , and thus convection zones , must be present in stars that are located well above the f5 boundary line .",
    "uv spectra from the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _",
    "telescope , for example , trace chromospheric emission in l@xmath0  and in the 1335   lines of along the main sequence into the late - a stars , near = 0.20 ( simon & landsman 1991 ; marilli et al . 1992 ; landsman & simon 1993 ) , while a number of a stars have been detected in x rays by the _ einstein observatory _ or by _ rosat _ ( schmitt et al . 1985 ; simon , drake , & kim 1995 ) , including a handful of a0 stars with @xmath6 . the x - rays of the cooler a - type stars are believed to be coronal in origin .",
    "those of the hotter stars are thought to come not from the a stars themselves , but from hidden late - type binary companions or neighboring stars that lie within the x - ray beam . only rarely can this ambiguity be resolved ( e.g , schmitt & krster 1993 ) .",
    "uv spectroscopy largely avoids this difficulty with the imagery , since the high temperature uv lines of a bright a star are expected to outshine those of virtually any low mass companion . on the other hand",
    ", the detection of chromospheric emission against the bright photosphere of an a star poses challenges of its own , demanding moderate - to - high spectral resolution , minimal scattered light , and exceptional signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "such requirements were often beyond the capabilities of _ iue _ , but can now be met routinely by instruments aboard _ hst _",
    ", such as the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) .    in previous work with the ghrs ( simon , landsman , & gilliland 1994 , hereafter slg )",
    ", we obtained high quality moderate resolution spectra of the 1335   lines for 8 mid- to late - a stars . only in the case of the a7 v star , @xmath0  aql ( altair ) ,",
    "did we find evidence for chromospheric emission .",
    "we chose the lines for this earlier study because they are among the brightest features in the uv spectra of g  m stars ; moreover , the photosphere of an a star is much fainter at 1335   than it is at longer wavelengths , where the increasing brightness of the background can render even strong lines , such as 1550  , completely invisible ( simon & landsman 1991 ) .",
    "the strongest a star chromospheric line accessible to the ghrs is l@xmath0 .",
    "this line suffers the dual disadvantage of contamination by scattered light in the earth s atmosphere and attenuation by interstellar along the line of sight to the star .",
    "nonetheless , even at low resolution and low s / n , _ iue _",
    "spectra have yielded some detections among the late - a and early - f stars ( landsman & simon 1993 ) .",
    "accordingly , with this _ iue _ work in mind , we have initiated a program of ghrs l@xmath0  spectroscopy for a modest sample of bright a stars .",
    "our goal was to establish more stringent constraints on the locus for the onset of main sequence convection zones . in this article ,",
    "we report the initial results of our observations , which include the first detection of chromospheric emission in a mid - a type star , as well as the first detections of @xmath7 k 1239  transition region emission in the spectra of two late a - type stars .",
    "we acquired ghrs spectra of the 12001230   region at intermediate spectral resolution with the g140 m grating and the small science aperture for seven mid- to late - a type stars .",
    "two of the principal chromospheric lines located within this interval are l@xmath0  @xmath81215.67 and 1206.51  .",
    "the latter is situated within the very dark , broad wings of the photospheric l@xmath0  line , which serves to enhance the contrast of the emission feature against the stellar background on which it lies .",
    "we summarize the results here for four stars ( @xmath2 eri , altair , @xmath0 cep , and @xmath0 hyi ) , but we postpone a discussion of the less well exposed spectra of three remaining stars ( @xmath0 pic , @xmath9 uma , and @xmath0 cir ) to a later date . for two stars , altair and @xmath0 cep , we obtained large aperture g140 m spectra , centered on the @xmath101393.76 , 1402.77 lines .",
    "these spectra cover the wavelength range from 1385   to 1415  .",
    "photospheric absorption lines dominate the latter pair of spectra , and no transition region emission is evident in either one .",
    "we observed the same stars , i.e. , altair and @xmath0  cep , with the g140l grating and the large science aperture , obtaining coverage of the 11801440   region at low spectral resolution .",
    "the above mentioned observations were carried out in the standard operational modes , as described by the ghrs _ instrument handbook _ ( soderblom et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the relevant procedures include sub - stepping the spectrum by fractional diodes of the digicon detector to improve the sampling , moving the spectrum by integral numbers of diodes to compensate for detector defects , and multi - diode rotations of the grating to facilitate the removal of fixed pattern noise . to calibrate the wavelength scales of our small aperture spectra , we obtained scans of an onboard pt - ne hollow - cathode lamp .",
    "the wavelength scales of the large aperture spectra were verified and corrected via the spybal spectra that accompany each science observation ( cf .",
    "soderblom et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the data were analyzed within stsdas / iraf , with minor post - processing in idl . in the way of an initial overview ,",
    "figure 1 shows our low resolution spectra of altair and @xmath0 cep .",
    "in addition to l@xmath0 , several features , which can not be seen even in the best images from _ iue _ because of the high scattered light levels and low s / n ratio , are observed here for the very first time in a - star spectra .",
    "these include 1176  , 1206  , and 1239  . the temperatures at which these lines form range from @xmath11 k to @xmath12 k. the presence of is particularly noteworthy , as it represents the highest excitation stage recorded to date in the uv for any normal a star .",
    "at longer wavelengths , there appears to be an emission feature near 1400  . in our g140 m spectra ,",
    "the same peak is located at 1394.34  , much too long a wavelength for it to be the transition region line of . according to an atlas9 model , this part of the photospheric spectrum",
    "is dominated by absorption lines of .",
    "we find , by numerically broadening the model flux distribution to @xmath13 km s@xmath14 , that there is a reasonable match to the overall shape of our g140l observation , including the observed `` emission peak . ''",
    "we take this as an indication that the aforementioned peak is a window of reduced line blanketing rather than a strongly wavelength - shifted transition region emission line .",
    "the line profiles from three of our g140 m small aperture observations are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath2 eri is weak , but presents what we regard as marginal evidence for an emission line .",
    "a much deeper exposure is needed for confirmation . in the same spectrum ,",
    "we see relatively intense emission in l@xmath0 , at a level of @xmath15 erg @xmath16 s@xmath14 , and so there is no question but that @xmath2 eri has a chromosphere . at = 0.16 ,",
    "@xmath2  eri becomes the earliest main sequence a star known to possess a chromosphere .",
    "the broad , flat - topped shapes of the spectra for altair and @xmath0 cep , also shown in figure 2 , suggest considerable rotational broadening .",
    "however , in both cases the fwhm and fwzi imply @xmath17 km s@xmath14 , which is substantially greater than the rotation rates of @xmath18240 km s@xmath14 customarily cited for these stars .",
    "other examples of excess broadening in ghrs spectra of later - type stars are discussed by ayres et al .",
    "these authors offer several possible explanations for this effect , but find no entirely satisfactory answer .",
    "the wavelength centroids of the lines of altair and @xmath0 cep are centered on the radial velocities of the stars , or may be slightly offset by @xmath19 km s@xmath14 .",
    "similar redshifts are observed for other late - type stars ( ayres et al .",
    "our measurements of altair and @xmath0  cep appear to rule out any possible wind outflow at chromospheric heights for both stars ( see slg ) , since if these lines were produced in a moderate - to - high velocity wind we would expect them to be appreciably blueshifted .",
    "over the course of an _ hst _ orbit , neither star showed significant variability in .",
    "moreover , the g140 m and g140l line fluxes agree to within 4% for both stars .",
    "this sets limits on any longer - term ( 68 months ) spectral variability , as well as on the extent of possible light losses and flux calibration uncertainties in our small aperture spectra .",
    "table 1 summarizes the new uv line fluxes , along with revised fluxes for altair and @xmath0 cep .",
    "the latter are based on the earlier study by slg , except that we assume a brightness ratio of 8:1 in accordance with the relative strengths of the chromospheric lines listed in table 1 , instead of the 22:1 ratio adopted by slg from consideration of low s / n spectra of l@xmath0  from _ iue_.",
    "our revised fluxes for altair and @xmath0 cep are in close agreement with , and only 18% higher and 18% lower , respectively , than those derived by walter , matthews , & linsky ( 1995 ) by means of an entirely different approach .",
    "to gauge the intrinsic activity of the a stars , we use the barnes - evans ( 1976 ) relation to convert the apparent fluxes in table 1 , @xmath20 , to surface fluxes at the star , @xmath21 .",
    "the results are in table 2 , along with comparable numbers for x - ray emission . for comparison",
    ", we also tabulate surface fluxes for representative g and k stars .",
    "these values derive mainly from ghrs spectra ( e.g. , ayres et al . 1997 ) or , in some cases , from compilations of _ iue _ and _ rosat _ data that have appeared in the literature ( e.g. , ayres et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in terms of their chromospheric or transition region fluxes ,",
    "the a stars resemble moderately active late - type dwarfs or giants ( e.g. , @xmath22 eri or @xmath23 cet ) , but they are ( to no surprise ) much less active than the rapidly - rotating hertzsprung gap giants ( e.g. , 31 com ) and the tidally locked rs cvn binaries ( e.g. , v711 tau ) . in coronal x rays , the a stars are comparable to middle aged stars like the sun and @xmath24 cen .",
    "they are substantially less active than prototypical , rapidly rotating , young dwarf stars like @xmath25 ori . nor are they as active as any of the late - type giants .",
    "these trends are more clearly illustrated in the h ",
    "r bubble diagram shown in figure 3 . in this figure , we scale the diameter of the circle for each star to the common logarithm of the normalized flux value , @xmath26 . turning to the top panel , we find no evidence in the line for a decline in chromospheric activity along the main sequence , even among the middle a stars ( that is , for effective temperatures as high as 8200 k ) if one includes the uncertain measurement of @xmath2  eri .",
    "by contrast , the coronal x - ray fluxes in the lower panel of the figure show an enormous decline from one side of the diagram to the other , with the main sequence and more evolved early type stars to the left being considerably fainter than the late - type stars on the right .",
    "attention was drawn to the lower coronal / chromospheric flux ratios among the early type stars by simon & drake ( 1989 ) , who ascribed the effect to mass loss via coronal winds ; a more recent discussion by ayres et al .",
    "( 1997 ) concludes that the origin of these `` x - ray deficits '' may be related to the possible existence of very long coronal loops , but otherwise the trend remains unexplained . at intermediate ,",
    "transition region temperatures , a similar trend may be appearing in the / and / ratios , each being a factor of @xmath27 smaller among the a stars than among the g  k stars .",
    "however , given the lack of truly adequate numbers of high quality spectra of for stars of all mk classes , this possibility requires further study with the _",
    "hst_.    continuing the tendency toward a broad dispersion in line strengths among the early f stars that was noted in our previous work ( simon & landsman 1991 ;",
    "landsman & simon 1993 ) , the surface fluxes of the a stars in table 2 indicate that altair is at least a factor of 2 more active than @xmath0 cep over the entire range of temperatures from chromospheric to coronal , despite the otherwise close similarities of these two stars ( @xmath0 cep has the slightly lower surface gravity ) .",
    "our spectra also largely put to rest the notion that the weak x - ray emission of these particular stars might be linked to a shift in their peak coronal heating below @xmath28 million k and to the formation of very cool coronae .",
    "the observed line strengths , and their ratios to fluxes of cooler chromospheric lines , make that appear extremely unlikely . however",
    ", only measurements of lines formed at 0.51 million k can answer this question for certain , and the needed observations await the launch of future space missions .",
