    "coronal holes ( chs ) are areas which are seen dark in x  rays and extreme ultraviolet @xcite .",
    "their plasma temperature and density is much lower than that of the ambient corona ; so , they are low emission zones @xcite .",
    "one of the important characteristics of chs is their magnetic field , which is characterized by being mainly unipolar @xcite with open magnetic field lines @xcite ; this means that its direction is primarily radial and the tangential component can be considered zero for distances greater than 2.5rs @xcite , with rs being the solar radius .",
    "closed magnetic field lines can keep the plasma within coronal loops ; however , since the field is open in chs , the plasma can escape into the interplanetary medium making up the solar wind .",
    "it has been shown that the emergence of a small bipolar region from below the solar surface and its interaction with the preexisting open field in the coronal hole is a prime candidate to trigger reconnection and the consequent launching of jets along field lines in the corona @xcite .",
    "magnetic reconnection , which may occur between open and closed magnetic field lines or between open lines @xcite is of great importance in the study of chs , especially near their boundaries .",
    "the process of continuous reconnection at ch boundaries is known as `` interchange reconnection '' @xcite . @xcite",
    "have proposed two kinds of interchange reconnection , the first occurs when two open field regions of the same polarity are separated by photospheric flux of the opposite polarity and the reconnection takes place between the open flux domains and the underlying pair of loop systems .",
    "the second involves stepwise displacements within a region of single magnetic polarity and occurs when an open field line exchanges footpoints with a closed field line rooted next to it and the reconnection happens at the apex of the closed loop .",
    "hence , coronal magnetic reconnection near ch boundaries can be responsible for their shape , magnetic topology and evolution .",
    "moreover , the appearance / disappearance of bright points ( bps ) associated with short term evolution of ch boundaries @xcite , as well as ch topological changes associated with cmes @xcite or with filament eruptions and subsequent cmes @xcite reported in previous studies can be explained by the associated magnetic field configuration .    regarding the origin of cmes , statistical studies",
    "show that 70% of prominence eruptions are associated with cmes @xcite , moreover chs may also be considered as signatures of cmes @xcite .",
    "in addition , filament eruptions are associated with the formation of small adjacent chs and/or topological fluctuations of chs @xcite ; and/or increased ch area @xcite ; and/or decrease and/or its complete disappearance @xcite .",
    "using h@xmath1 movies and spectroheliograms taken at observatoire de paris - meudon , @xcite reviewed 42 quiescent solar filaments/ prominences eruptions during two minimum periods of solar activity ( 19851986 and 1994 ) .",
    "these authors found that the majority of prominence / filament eruptions ( @xmath291% ) are associated with the presence of adjacent chs and subsequent cmes .",
    "magnetic reconnection is probably the mechanism responsible for the interaction between chs and prominences located close to their boundaries , which may result in the onset of cmes .",
    "however , the characteristics of this process is not yet clear .",
    "recent studies show that nearly 15@xmath0 distance between the prominences and ch boundaries could be considered as a possible critical distance for their interaction @xcite .",
    "the sun is the primary driver of space weather ; the most severe solar activity occurs around the cycle maximum , but its influence on the magnetosphere and ionosphere continues through the solar minimum @xcite .",
    "major events occur due to cmes and high - speed solar wind streams associated with chs @xcite , as the solar wind speed originating in chs is of about 750800 km / s @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that both the chs as well as their offspring , the high - speed solar wind streams , are representative of an inactive or quiet sun @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the slow decline of solar cycle 23 and slow rise of cycle 24 show that the low solar activity lasted from about 2006 to the end of 2009 , with 2008 and 2009 being particularly quiet years @xcite , which is reflected in several solar irradiance observations , such as solar uv and euv irradiance , and radio flux at 10.7 cm wavelengths @xcite .",
    "moreover , in 2007 and 2008 , the effect of multiple , large , and long - lived chs resulted in regular and recurrent solar wind streams and fast wind above 550 km / s , whereas in 2009 , the disappearance of the low - latitude chs shifted the sources of the solar wind to higher latitudes , mostly to the edges of the polar chs with a drop of about 20% in the mean speed and the almost total disappearance of fast solar wind .",
    "generally , the continuous presence of multiple , low  latitude chs during 2007 and 2008 and the very low magnetic flux emergence , made the minimum between cycles 23 and 24 different from the two previous minima @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the possible association between ch topological changes and nearby prominence eruptions followed by cmes as well as by sequences of cmes .",
    "we analyze three events involving the evolution of the boundaries of chs and of their surrounding regions ( within @xmath3 distance ) , taking a temporal window of 12 days .",
    "we identify their topological changes from one day before until one day after a cme occurrence . the events took place during the recent solar minimum years , 2008 and 2009 .",
    "the short  term topological changes of studied chs are accompanied by the disappearance of nearby quiescent filaments , as well as subsequent cmes .",
    "the method used in this work is similar to the one reported by @xcite .",
    "we consider a period of 12 days of continuous observations of a ch evolution ( far from big flares ) including the pre- and post - cme stages ; thus , we study cmes not associated to flares .",
    "the selected quiescent filaments / prominences are located close to ch boundaries or its surrounding regions ( within 15@xmath0 distance ) .",
    "our study comprises from august 24 to september 4 of 2008 , december 314 , 2008 and may 2031 , 2009 . during these time periods",
    "we study one equatorial and 4 polar chs , 3 filaments and 7 associated cmes .",
    "this method allows us to identify every ch topological change before and after a non - flare cme .",
    "the identification and daily evolution of each coronal hole is based on x  ray images supplied by hinode ( xrt , http://darts.isas.jaxa.jp/solar/hinode/ ) , euv images from eit / soho ( http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/ ) , euvi / stereo ( http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) , secchi / stereo movies ( http:// secchi.nrl.navy.mil/index.php?p=movies ) and magnetograms from the wilcox solar observatory ( wso , http://wso.stanford.edu/ ) and michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) instrument on the soho ( http://sohowww.nascom .",

    "the starting and ending times of this process approximately coincide with the onset of cme1.1 and cme1.3 respectively .",
    "the consecutive growth and decrease in latitudinal width and the growth in longitudinal width of this eastern section of ch1 coincides with the appearance and disappearance of bright point ( bp1 ) near its western boundary ( it appears on august 28 , @xmath207:00 ut and disappers on august 30 , @xmath201:30 ut , see for example figure [ figure2 ] on august 29 , 06:05 ut ) and with the eruption of filament ( f1 ) in progress .",

    "the appearance of one of the bps coincides with the maximum separation between both chs ( ch2 and ch3 ) ; then , it disappears after the cme2 onset , whereas the lifetime of the other bp coincides with the time period between the disconnection and reconnection of the chs ( ch2+ch3 ) and it disappears before the cme2 onset . regarding event 3 , located at the south pole , we observe the appearance of a bp ( bp1 ) before the starting time of prominence eruption followed by the appearance of other bp ( bp2 ) and two cmes ( cme3.1 , cme3.2 ) , then bp1 intensifies , simultaneously ch4 fragments in two main sections around this bp ; this is followed by cme3.3 . after these 3 cmes",
    "the bps disappear .",
    "each of the bright points observed near the ch ( event 1 and event 2 ) boundaries is associated with a small magnetic dipole that appears and disappears simultaneously with bp .",
    "the most evident topological changes of the chs are seen after the onset of the cmes . for event 1 ( north pole ch ) , between the starting times of cme1.1 and cme1.3",
    ", the eastern section of ch1 ( which lays in the same direction as cme1.1 and cme1.3 ) decreases its latitudinal width and increases its longitudinal width , whereas the small part of its western section disappears before the onset of the west limb cme1.2 . for event 2 , ch2 ( north pole ch ) and ch3 ( equatorial ch ) appear separated after cme2 onset .",
    "regarding event 3 ( south pole ch ) , ch4 disintegrates after cme3.2 onset , and after cme3.3 onset the separation between these segments reaches its maximum .",
    "we have found that short  term topological changes in the entire chs are associated with nearby quiescent prominence eruptions , particularly when a separation between the quiescent filaments and the ch boundary is less than or equal to 15@xmath0 , followed by the ejection of one or more cmes @xcite .",
    "similar results regarding the separation distance ( of @xmath210@xmath0 ) between the filament and ch boundaries , associated with prominence eruption and subsequent cme were reported recently by @xcite .",
    "in addition , our observations indicate that bp appearance or disappearance is related with the starting processes of nearby filament eruptions , which can be caused by disturbances of the ch environment .",
    "these disturbances are most likely the result of magnetic reconnection between magnetic field lines associated with bps and the surrounding of ch boundaries followed by the reorganization the magnetic field , which results in different bp lifetimes and ch boundary or area changes and reaches the foot points of nearby filaments , contributing in this way to their destabilization , eruption , and subsequent cme ejection .",
    "there are several proposed models and observational evidences related to magnetic reconnection at ( or close to ) the ch boundaries and related with visible appearance / disappearance of bps , filament eruptions , short - term topological changes in the entire chs and subsequent formation of cmes @xcite .",
    "specially , magnetic bipoles emerging within a ch or small loops formed in the ch during interchange reconnection could increase along a ch lifetime and ultimately lead to the fragmentation and diffusion of the ch @xcite .",
    "interchange reconnection at ch boundaries is supported by several observational results @xcite , e.g. , the prevalence of very small loops inside chs and larger loops outside chs @xcite and the boundary displacements observed due to the emergence and disappearance of bright small  scale loops in the form of bps @xcite .",
    "in addition , we observe that the direction of the erupted filaments near chs and associated cmes is almost non  radial . both structures ( regarding the three studied events )",
    "are moving toward the equator .",
    "in addition , the difference between the central position angles of both ranges between 15@xmath0 and 20@xmath0 .",
    "these observations are consistent with the results reported by @xcite ; they found that the cmes generally move away from the open magnetic field regions and their the deflection is probably due to the fact that at lower coronal heights they are guided by the open field along which the fast solar wind flows .    in this study",
    "we are not considering long  term topological variation of coronal holes in regard to different stages of the solar cycle and the associated involvement of prominence eruptions and subsequent cmes , which we plan to pursue in an upcoming project .",
