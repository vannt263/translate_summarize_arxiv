    "these polarons and thereby most of the properties of these mn@xmath4 - mn@xmath5 mixed valent compounds depend on the topology of the mno@xmath3 octahedra in their structure . among the recently proposed models , the one based on electronic phase separation ( ps)@xcite has been attracting considerable attention . according the ps model the metal - insulator ( mi ) transitions in these materials",

    "there have been many structural studies showing the co - existence of such metallic and insulating phases @xcite with sizes varying from nanoscopic to microscopic . the cluster - glass ( cg ) compositions of sm@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 system are some of the materials in which such a phase separation could be unambiguously shown using neutron diffraction , owing to the large sizes of the magnetic domains possible in them @xcite .",
    "separation of these magnetic phases in this system has been found to be related to the strong distortions in their gdfeo@xmath2-type structure . also , these distortions control the topology of the mno@xmath3 octahedra of their structure and thereby the one electron band width ( w ) and the electron localization effects . the near fermi level ( e@xmath6 ) electronic behavior of these phase separated systems could possibly be different from those of the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 which has long been identified as a canonical de cmr system @xcite due to its large w. further , since the term j@xmath7 @xmath8w ( j@xmath7 is the hund s coupling ) which expresses the effective coupling between the @xmath9 and the t@xmath10 electrons of the crystal field split mno@xmath3 octahedra in their structure , remains in the weak - coupling regime , the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 system is regarded as the least affected by the electron - electron and electron - lattice correlation effects among the cmr manganites . on the other hand ,",

    "the insulator - metal transition in the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 system is due to the hopping of the e@xmath46 electrons from mn@xmath4 to mn@xmath5 via the de and superexchange interactions .",

    "the c - type afmi regions could be more prone to the electron localization effects compared to the fmm domains .",

    "consequently , this can result in higher binding energies for those e@xmath46 electrons in afmi regions compared to the ones in the fmm domains .",
