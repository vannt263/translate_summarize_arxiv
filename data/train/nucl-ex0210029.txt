    "multiple intermediate mass fragment ( imf ) production in central heavy - ion collisions is related to the properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions .",
    "many different models have been proposed in order to explain the observed fragment production , and both theoretically and experimentally the situation is not clear .",
    "models with widely differing basic hypotheses can be equally good at describing the same data such as charge distributions , mean energies and angular distributions . in order to gain further understanding it is therefore necessary to have more detailed information on the multifragmentation process .",
    "one aspect of the reactions for which different models give very different predictions are the excitation energies of what we will call from now on the ` primary fragments ' : in other words the nuclei present around @xmath2100 fm / c after the collision , which are not necessarily the same as those arriving in the detectors a few 10 s of ns later . in quantum molecular dynamics  @xcite simulations or microcanonical metropolis monte - carlo model  @xcite calculations the primary fragments are rather cold i.e. they are almost unaffected by subsequent secondary decays and arrive unchanged in the detectors . in the former case ,",
    "the ( lack of ) excitation energy in the nascent fragments is determined by the collision dynamics , whereas in the latter case it is an assumption of the model when calculating the statistical weights of the partitions . on the other hand ,",
    "antisymmetrised molecular dynamics  @xcite and stochastic mean field  @xcite simulations both predict moderately `` hot '' primary fragments in reactions around the fermi energy , with @xmath3 amev  @xcite .",
    "finally , the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm )  @xcite and the microcanonical multifragmentation model of  @xcite allow primary fragments to be excited , the actual value in any given calculation being determined by energy conservation and the statistical weight given by the associated level density parametrisation .",
    "this latter may or may not take into account the level density limitation in isolated nuclei at high excitation  @xcite , equivalent to excluding from the primary partitions levels with very short lifetimes or introducing an effective limiting ( maximum ) temperature for hot nuclei  @xcite .",
    "our previous experimental work  @xcite has shown that the reconstruction of the average size and excitation energy of the primary fragments is possible by means of fragment - light charged particles ( imf - lcp ) relative velocity correlation functions .",
    "a constant value of the excitation energy of the primary fragments has been deduced at about 3 amev for the xe + sn system at 50 amev .",
    "it was also possible to deduce the multiplicities of the secondary particles evaporated by the primary fragments .",
    "more recently analogous results and conclusions have been obtained for central collisions of kr + nb at 45 amev  @xcite .",
    "an important question arises from these studies : what is the evolution of the fragment excitation energies and secondary lcp multiplicities as a function of incident energy ?",
    "the experimental answer to this question may permit to distinguish between different scenarios and assumptions made by different models .",
    "it should give a strong test of the validity of some of their basic hypotheses .",
    "in this paper we extend the previous study  @xcite to a wider incident energy range , from 32 to 50 amev for central collisions of the xe + sn system measured with the 4@xmath4 indra detector  @xcite .",
    "excitation functions for the fragment excitation energy and the fraction of secondary emitted lcp correlated to the fragments will be shown .",
    "we will give in section 2 a brief description of the detector , the way we select the events and an overview of the fragment production .",
    "we will describe in section 3 the method employed to extract the lcp s correlated to each fragment .",
    "the method used for the decorrelation in this work is different from the previous one  @xcite but gives almost the same results .",
    "the experimental results are then given in section 4 .",
    "in section 5 a comparison of the deduced primary excitation energy and secondary lcp multiplicities to smm calculations is given .",
    "we then discuss the results in section 6 .",
    "the experiment was performed at ganil with the multidetector indra  @xcite .",
    "this charged product detector covers about 90% of the 4@xmath5 solid angle .",
    "the total number of detection cells is 336 arranged according to 17 rings centred on the beam axis .",
    "the first ring ( @xmath6-@xmath7 ) is made of fast ne102/ne115 phoswich detectors .",
    "rings 2 to 9 cover the angular range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and are made of three detector layers : a low pressure gas - ionisation chamber , a 300 @xmath9 thick silicon detector and a 14 to 10 cm thick csi(tl ) scintillator .",
    "the remaining 8 rings cover the angular range from @xmath8 to @xmath10 and have two detection layers : ionisation chamber and 7.6 to 5 cm thick csi(tl ) scintillators . for the studied system xe + sn , fragments with z up to 54",
    "are identified in the forward region . beyond @xmath8 ,",
    "the charge resolution is one unit up to z=16 and few charges above . over the whole angular range , a very good isotope identification",
    "is obtained for z=1 to z=3 , except for particles with low energies where ambiguities are unresolved .",
    "the energy calibration of the csi(tl ) scintillators was obtained for light charged particles ( lcp ) by means of the elastic and inelastic scattering of secondary lcp beams ( @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 ) produced by the fragmentation of a 95 amev @xmath14o beam on a thick c target .",
    "these particles were then momentum selected by the `` alpha magnetic spectrometer '' of ganil and scattered in a c or ta target installed in the indra reaction chamber . for @xmath15 fragments ,",
    "the energy calibration was made by using the @xmath16/e technique .",
    "a typical energy resolution was about @xmath17 .",
    "the energy threshold was a few 100 kev for light particles , 0.7 amev for z=3 and 1.4 amev for z=35 . a complete technical description of indra ,",
    "its calibration and its electronics can be found in  @xcite .",
    "two selections have been made to isolate central collisions .",
    "the first one is the requirement of quasi - complete events by accepting in the off - line analysis only events having total detected charge @xmath18",
    "@xmath19 @xmath20 of the initial total charge of the system .",
    "the second is the use of the flow angle ( @xmath21 ) selection  @xcite .",
    "this angle is a global observable defined as the angle between the beam axis and the main direction of emission of matter in each event as determined by the energy tensor calculated from fragment ( @xmath15 ) c.m .",
    "momenta  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown for heavy ion reactions in the fermi energy range @xcite that events with small @xmath21 are dominated by binary dissipative collisions .",
    "on the other hand events with little or no memory of the entrance channel should be isotropic , thus favouring large @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "quasi - complete events having @xmath23 for 50 amev bombarding energy and @xmath24 for the three other systems correspond to an isotropic emission of the imf in the centre of mass of the whole system .",
    "these events are compatible with decay of a compact object which could take place after fast emission of a direct light particle component .",
    "indeed the velocity of the fragments are evenly distributed around the centre of mass velocity  @xcite . by taking into account the detection efficiency and other biases due to the selection",
    "we have estimated the cross sections for ` isotropic central collisions ' to decrease from 115@xmath2520 mb at 32 amev to 85@xmath2510 mb at 50 amev .",
    "more details about this event selection for xe + sn collisions at 3250 amev incident energy and the extraction of the cross sections can be found in  @xcite .      before determining the characteristics of the fragments ,",
    "let us first show an overview of their production in central collisions of xe + sn from 32 to 50 amev .",
    "figure [ f : zdis ] shows their charge distributions normalised to the number of events so that the four bombarding energies can    ]    be compared .",
    "the production of small fragments ( @xmath26 ) increases with incident energy . for the charge range 10 to 15 the four distributions exhibit a kind of `` plateau '' . in this range",
    "the fragment production rates are roughly equivalent whatever the incident energy is .",
    "finally the charge distributions evolve from a broad shape at lower incident energy , where residues up to the size of the projectile are observed , toward an almost exponential form at 50 amev , favouring the production of lighter fragments .",
    "moreover figure [ f : zmax1 ] , where the distributions    ]    of the heaviest fragment in the event are shown , confirms this behaviour .",
    "here again the distribution at 32 amev is very broad , its average value is @xmath27 , it decreases to smaller @xmath28 at 50 amev .",
    "it is important to notice that , even with this strong evolution in the charge distribution , the mean fragment multiplicity does not change too much with the incident energy .",
    "it evolves from 5 to 7 fragments with @xmath15 only .",
    "concerning the kinematic characteristics of the fragments , figure [ f : spectre_ini ] shows an example of the fragment angle - integrated centre of mass kinetic    ]    energy spectra for li , o and p nuclei produced in central collisions of xe + sn at 32 and 50 amev .",
    "the distributions are broad ; they are broader for the heavier elements . comparing the spectra obtained at 32 and 50 amev ,",
    "we observe easily that their shape , in particular the slopes of their exponential tails , are different .",
    "the distributions are broader and harder at 50 than at 32 amev .",
    "selection , see text ) of xe + sn at 4 incident energies : 32 , 39 , 45 and 50 amev as a function of their atomic number .",
    "the statistical error bars are shown .",
    "[ f : ecmallz2 ] ]    we finally present in figure [ f : ecmallz2 ] , for the four incident energies , the mean centre of mass kinetic energy of the fragments as a function of their atomic number .",
    "it increases with the charge @xmath29 and then saturates beyond @xmath30 .",
    "it also increases with the bombarding energy but very little .",
    "we wondered whether this observation is true for central collisions in general , or is rather dependent on our selection .",
    "in fact it is the mean kinetic energy of the heaviest fragment which `` saturates '' while that of the other fragments increases monotonously with @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath31 selection we use is derived from fragment kinetic properties and therefore its effect on observables such as e.g. fragment energies and angular distributions must be taken into account in events selected in this way .",
    "nevertheless this selection has little influence on the study of individual fragment characteristics such as excitation energy and secondary decay , whatever the mechanism of their formation .",
    "the main aim of this work is to extract the intrinsic properties of the fragments independently of the mechanism responsible for their formation .",
    "are they excited  ?",
    "if so what are the associated lcp evaporated from the parents  ? reconstructing the primary fragments assumes that we are able experimentally to isolate the secondary contribution .",
    "this is possible if the fragments formed are not too excited , so that the time scale associated with their decay is much greater than the time scale of their production .",
    "the origin of the fragments is still an open question but is not the subject of this paper .      in the previous section",
    "it was shown that on average about 6 fragments are produced in central collisions of xe + sn at different energies .",
    "however the production of lcp is much more important , on average their number reaches 28 particles for the 50 amev beam energy .",
    "there are at least three different stages to produce these particles : i ) in the early stage of the collision , in this case we call them primary particles ; ii ) at the same time as the formation of the fragments ; iii ) they can be emitted from the excited primary fragments , we call those the secondary particles .",
    "correlation functions are a powerful tool for extracting small signals .",
    "this is the method we used to extract , on the average , the lcp emitted from each fragment . with the help of simulations",
    "we have developed a correlation technique to extract possible signals  @xcite .",
    "figure [ f : data ] shows the relative velocity distributions : i ) for p-@xmath32 pairs taken from the same events , ii ) for the uncorrelated events obtained by taking the fragment from a given event and the light particle from another event , iii ) the correlation function defined as the ratio of the correlated and uncorrelated relative velocity distributions , iv ) the difference correlation function defined as the difference between the correlated and uncorrelated distributions . in this work to decorrelate the relative velocity between the fragment and the lcp pairs we used the event mixing procedure  @xcite . in this example , for each phosphorus found in an event having a number of alphas @xmath33 we take randomly @xmath33 alphas emitted in @xmath33 other events .",
    "this technique is different from the one reported in ref .",
    "@xcite where li nuclei were used to decorrelate the events .",
    "the problem with such a technique is that the li can be the product of the known resonance of @xmath34 which decays to @xmath35 + @xmath36 and increases the background , thus decreasing the yield of true correlated protons .",
    "however the final result is almost the same ( within the error bars ) as the old method of decorrelation of events based on li .",
    "as we can see , the example presented in figure [ f : data ] , exhibits a bump around 2.5 cm / ns relative velocity in the correlation function and difference function which may be related to the evaporation of an @xmath32 particle from a parent of phosphorus .",
    "the behaviour of this correlation encourages us to make such an analysis .",

    "[ f : data ] ]      the objective of this simulation is not to reproduce the data , it is more to have an idea about the shape of the background .",
    "we used a modified version of the simon event generator  @xcite to simulate a scenario deduced from bnv  @xcite calculations .",
    "two steps are assumed in these simulations .",
    "the first step is the cooling of the initial fused system through a sequential light particles ( lp ) emission process ( primary lp ) , the second is the fragmentation of the smaller remaining source where the remaining excitation energy is shared between a fixed number of primary fragments ( typically 6 to 7 fragments )",
    ". then the primary fragments decay sequentially while moving apart under coulomb forces plus an initial radial velocity .",
    "this simulation reproduces reasonably well the global experimental features .",
    "in particular the kinematic observables are well reproduced ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite . )    ]    the calculated relative velocities are shown in figure [ f : simon].a ( thick lines ) for mg - p pairs and for input parameters which reproduce data for the 32 amev xe + sn central collisions . since in this version of simon we know",
    "which particle is emitted from which fragment , we plotted in the same figure the different contributions : the primary contribution ( dotted histogram ) that we call contribution 1 , the evaporated protons from all other fragments except the parents of magnesium ( dashed histogram ) that we call contribution 2 and finally the protons emitted from the parents of detected magnesium fragments ( hatched - dashed histogram ) called contribution 3 .",
    "as expected , the latter contribution is very small , it represents the protons truly correlated to the magnesium nucleus that we must extract from the data . figure [ f : simon].b shows the uncorrelated relative velocity for mg - p pairs reconstructed by mixing the calculated events .",
    "figure [ f : simon].c and [ f : simon].d show the mg - p correlation function ( the ratio of the correlated and uncorrelated relative velocity distributions of fig.[f : simon].a and fig.[f : simon].b ) and the difference function ( the difference of the latter distributions ) , respectively . in the same figures",
    "are plotted the associated true backgrounds ( dashed histograms ) calculated by dividing ( subtracting ) the sum of contributions 1 and 2 by the uncorrelated distribution ( of fig.[f : simon].b ) .",
    "the hatched areas represent the contribution of secondary emission from the parents of magnesium ( contribution 3 ) .",
    "the shape of the background shown in figure [ f : simon].c is well fitted by the function : @xmath37 where a , b and c are parameters which differ for each fragment - lcp pair .",
    "in fact only 3 coordinates are needed to solve this equation , we then used particular points from figure [ f : simon].d to do so .",
    "the first one corresponds to the first point at which the difference function is equal to zero ( at small relative velocity ) .",
    "the second point used is the local minimum seen at small relative velocity ( around 2.5 cm / ns ) in the difference function ( fig.[f : simon].d ) which corresponds to the minimum relative velocity allowed by the coulomb barrier .",
    "the third one corresponds to the first point where the difference function is equal to zero just after the second minimum , in this region the secondary evaporation vanishes .    in order to validate the method employed to estimate the background several tests have been made .",

    "we performed simon simulations assuming higher excitation energies in the primary fragments . for 7.5 amev excitation energies we recovered 81% of evaporated protons .",
    "this result indicates that the fraction of all evaporated protons recovered by this method is rather insensitive to the excitation energies of the primary fragments .",
    "because the experimental shape of the correlation function as well as the difference function ( fig.[f : data ] ) have the same behaviour as those in our simulation , we applied the same method to the experimental data to remove the background . from this simulation and method developed above",
    "we are able to isolate the lcp evaporated by the primary fragments .",

    "are plotted the corresponding background calculated with eq.1 by using three points taken from the experimental distributions as described in the above section .",
    "therefore the @xmath32 velocity spectrum is deduced by subtracting the background ( the curve in fig.[f : fond32 ] upper right panel ) from the difference function .",
    "this contribution represents the spectrum of @xmath32 particles emitted by the parent of @xmath38 fragment . from the mean value of the distribution we can deduce the average kinetic energy of alpha .",
    "its integral normalised to the total number of phosphorus nuclei provides the average multiplicity of @xmath32 particles evaporated from parents of p fragments .",
    "the uncertainties of the extracted quantities are mainly related to the uncertainty of taking the three points which define the background . in practice",
    "the first minimum in the difference function is easy to locate : the corresponding error is small ( see fig.[f : fond32].b ) .",

    "we then decided to take intervals around each point which are divided into a number of bins . considering all possible combinations of one bin in the first interval and another in",
    "the second leads to a distribution of multiplicities .",

    "this is shown in figure [ f : e_pl ] .",

    "notice that the kinetic energies of @xmath12 are high compared to the values of the other particles .",
    "the observed effect may be due to the higher identification threshold energy for @xmath12 .      to reconstruct the charge of the primary fragments we used the lcp multiplicities correlated to each fragment as described in the last paragraph .",

    "for the 50 amev case , where the limitation in the charge range is more important than for the other beam energies , the evaporated contribution changes very little and fails to increase the value of total evaporated charge from @xmath57 = 9 to @xmath57 = 14 predicted by smm ( fig .",
    "[ f : smm_lcp ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy is real , though , partly , it is caused by the thermal source size , which should decrease with the beam energy .",
    "the smm calculations do predict the decrease of the number of evaporated lcp , because of decreasing size and number of imf at very large excitation energies , in the `` falling '' part of the `` rise and fall '' of multifragmentation .",
    "however , in the experiment this effect is observed when the maximum of multifragmentation is not yet reached . in the calculations",
    "this behaviour takes place because the number of evaporated alpha particles increases , contrary to the experimental result .",
    "this could be a consequence of the secondary deexcitation prescription employed in smm  @xcite .",
    "an other possible reason would be an overexcitation of light primary imf s predicted by smm .",
    "the decay of these imf s contributes considerably into lcp production and their share increases with the thermal energy .",
    "the decrease of the experimental evaporated component @xmath57 at high energy could be alternatively understood if we consider the increasing effect of the collision dynamics .",
    "the direct emission of lcp increases with the incident energy while the proportion of the thermal contribution decreases .",
    "this could be mocked up in the smm calculations by decreasing the thermal source size , but can in no case be predicted by smm .",
    "it is worth noting the contribution of light charged particles produced at freeze - out as predicted by smm .",
    "figure [ f : smm_lcp ] shows that this contribution increases with the beam energy more rapidly than that of the evaporated particles .",
    "in this work we have directly measured the saturation of the thermal excitation energy deposited in fragments produced in central heavy - ion collisions between 32 and 50 amev , by associating with each detected cold fragment the light charged particles evaporated by the primary excited parent nucleus .",
    "this saturation at excitation energies of around 3 amev observed in section [ s : extraction ] ( see figure [ f : ebeam_excit ] ) is accompanied by a saturation of the number of evaporated lcp , that leads to a decrease in the proportion of evaporated to all detected lcp , with increasing incident energy ( see figure [ f : pourc ] or figure [ f : smm_lcp ] ) .",
    "a similar saturation has been observed in an earlier work by jiang et al.@xcite using a completely different experimental method , based on the measurement of neutron multiplicities .",
    "the authors claimed the saturation of the thermal energy deposited in hot nuclei formed in collisions of ar + au and ar + th in the energy range 27 - 77 amev .",
    "their claim was based on the observation of a saturation of the multiplicity of evaporated neutrons , as well as that of the light charged particles detected in coincidence at backward angles , in central collisions at increasing beam energies .",
    "the neutron multiplicity saturates for the system ar + th around 30 amev at @xmath58 .",
    "let us note in passing that we estimate the neutron multiplicity per event evaporated by the system xe + sn to be @xmath59 at 39 amev .",
    "in @xcite the authors concluded that the observed saturation was due to the increasing inefficiency of the reaction mechanism to deposit thermal energy in to the hot nuclei it produced , rather than it being related to reaching the limits of excitation energy or temperature that a nucleus may support . in discussing the results of the present work we must ask ourselves the same question , but",
    "the situation is complicated by the fact that here we are dealing with several heated nuclei per event which may themselves result from the break - up of some other heavy , hot system . here",
    "we will present some elements which may help to find an answer .",
    "although the excitation energies of primary fragments remain constant for incident energies @xmath6039 amev , the detected fragment partitions continue to evolve , becoming steeper with increasing bombarding energy ( figure [ f : zdis ] ) while the average charge of the largest fragment varies from 25 at 32 amev to 15 at 50 amev ( figure [ f : zmax1 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that with increasing energy , above 39amev , the average number and temperature of primary fragments produced in the reactions does not change , whereas their average size decreases .",
    "moreover , in order to conserve the total mass of the system the number of light particles produced prior to secondary evaporation from fragments must also increase with increasing energy .",
    "if indeed the mechanism for thermal energy deposition saturates , then the energy not used in forming and heating fragments has to be evacuated by some other means , for example direct particle production .",
    "this would lead to such an increase in non - evaporated particle multiplicity .",
    "some energy may also be locked up as kinetic energy of fragments due to some kind of collective motion , either isotropic ( compression - expansion effects ) or anisotropic ( incomplete stopping ) .",
    "it should be recalled that the decrease of fragment excited state lifetimes with the excitation energy can limit the mean excitation values obtained in this paper . however , simulations we have performed indicate that the effect of shorter lifetimes on the efficiency of the method is quite small for primary fragment excitation energies up to 7.5 amev .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with a recent compilation of limiting temperatures extracted from different experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "it suggests that @xmath61 decreases with increasing nuclear mass , in good agreement with calculations @xcite .",
    "the primary fragments considered in the present work ( figure [ f : zpr_apr])have , at the very most , masses @xmath62 , while most of them have masses in the region @xmath6350 . the corresponding limiting temperature from @xcite is @xmath64 mev or @xmath65 amev .",
    "as these values are much higher than the 3 amev maximum excitation energy we find in our primary fragments , this would imply that the observed saturation is due to reaction mechanism and not related to @xmath61 .",
    "however , in the same compilation limiting excitation energies @xmath66 amev are found for the heaviest nuclei with masses in the @xmath67200 range . if we suppose that fragments are produced by the break - up of some heavy composite system formed in the reaction ( as in smm calculations )",
    "then it is possible that the observed saturation of primary fragment excitation energies is due to the saturation of the excitation energy of the initial system , which attains its ( mass - dependent ) @xmath61 .",
    "we have presented in this paper the experimental results of the intrinsic properties of the fragments produced in the central collisions of xe + sn from 32 to 50 amev bombarding energy .",
    "quantitative experimental determination of the size and excitation energy of the primary fragments produced at such collisions before their decay are given for the four beam energies .",
    "the comparison of these extracted quantities with models provides a crucial test of some of their basic assumptions .",
    "the experimental methods used in this work are based on the relative velocity correlation functions between the detected fragment and light charged particles .",
    "thus we have extracted the average multiplicity of the evaporated particles and their average kinetic energies in the centre of mass of the fragments .",
    "these two variables have been used in order to reconstruct the average charge , mass and excitation energy of the primary fragments .",
    "our results show that for a given beam energy , the excitation energy per nucleon is almost constant over the whole studied range of fragment charge .",
    "the statistical multifragmentation model , smm , reproduces very well the internal excitation energy of the primary fragments . the average value of this quantity increase from 2.3 amev for a beam energy 32 amev to saturate around 3 amev for 39 amev and above .",
    "we also deduced the proportion of evaporated light charged particles per event , amounting to 30% of the total measured lcp for the 32 amev reaction , increasing to 35% at 39 amev and decreasing down to 23% for 50 amev .",
    "therefore the majority of light charged particles are not evaporated by excited primary fragments in these reactions .",
    "neither the absolute values of this proportion nor its evolution are reproduced by smm calculations assuming a constant size for the multifragmenting system .",
    "the two last results may indicate either i ) that the system which disassembles into fragments is not able to sustain more than 3 amev thermal excitation energy and the excitation energy of the fragments reflects the temperature limit of that system , or / and ii ) that the mechanism of dissipation of beam energy in to thermal energy of hot nuclei saturates above @xmath68amev , and the kinetic energy in excess is evacuated via direct particle production and collective motion of the fragments .",
    "we thank a. botvina for fruitful discussions and for performing the smm calculations .",
    "we thank also the staff of the ganil accelerator facility for their support during the experiment .",
    "this work was supported by le commissariat  lenergie atomique , le centre national de la recherche scientifique , le ministre de leducation nationale , and le conseil regional de basse normandie ."
