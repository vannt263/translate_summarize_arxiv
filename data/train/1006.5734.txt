    "in modern cosmology our notions concerning the early universe have introduced a new element , the inflationary phase of the early universe @xcite , which provides an attractive scenario for solving some of the fundamental puzzles of the standard big bang model , like the horizon and the flatness problems as well as providing a framework for sensible calculations of primordial density perturbations .    even in the context of the inflationary scenario",
    "however one encounters the initial singularity problem which remains unsolved , showing that the universe necessarily had a beginning for generic inflationary cosmological model@xcite .",
    "recently models that can avoid those conclusions have been discovered @xcite .",
    "the way to escape the singularity in these models is to violate the geometrical assumptions of these theorems , which assume i ) that the universe has open space sections ii ) the hubble expansion is always greater than zero in the past . in @xcite,@xcite the open space section condition is violated since closed robertson walker universes with @xmath1 are considered and the hubble expansion can become zero , so that both i ) and ii ) are avoided .    in @xcite",
    "even models based on standard general relativity , ordinary matter and minimally coupled scalar fields were considered and can provide indeed a non singular ( geodesically complete ) inflationary universe , with a past eternal einstein static universe that eventually evolves into an inflationary universe .",
    "those most simple models suffer however from instabilities , associated with the instability of the einstein static universe .",
    "the instability is possible to cure by going away from gr , considering non perturbative corrections to the einsteins field equations in the context of the loop quantum gravity@xcite , a brane world cosmology with a time like extra dimension@xcite , considering the starobinski model for radiative corrections ( which can not be derived from an effective action)@xcite , exotic matter@xcite or @xmath2 theories in the presence of perfect fluids with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , the consideration of a jordan brans dicke model also can provide a stable initial state for the emerging universe scenario @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a different theoretical framework where such emerging universe scenario is realized in a natural way , where instabilities are avoided and a successful inflationary phase with a graceful exit can be achieved .",
    "we work in the context of a two measures theory ( tmt ) @xcite and more specifically in the context of the scale invariant realization of such theories @xcite .",
    "these theories can provide a new approach to the cosmological constant problem and can be generalized to obtain also a theory with a dynamical spacetime @xcite .",
    "we will show how the stated goals can be achieved in the framework of the tmt models .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows : in section ii the effective field eqs . in the einstein frame ,",
    "give rise to an effective potential for a dilaton field ( needed to implement a model with global scale invariance ) which presents a flat region .",
    "this model can describe an emerging universe scenario . in section iii , we look at the generalization of this model @xcite by adding a curvature square , `` @xmath0 '' , and show that the resulting model contain a flat region .",
    "furthermore the universe can evolve into an inflationary state which can undergo a successful graceful exit .",
    "we end with a discussion and conclusions section .",
    "it is possible to obtain a model that through a spontaneous breaking of scale invariance can give us an emerging universe scenario .",
