    "the `` problem of the @xmath6 spheres , '' so named by schtte and van der waerden  @xcite and leech  @xcite , asks whether there exists any configuration of @xmath6 non - overlapping unit spheres that all touch a central unit sphere .",
    "it was raised in the time of newton by david gregory , and eventually resolved mathematically as impossible .",
    "its resolution established that the `` kissing number '' of equal spheres in @xmath7-dimensional euclidean space is @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is concerned with a related but different problem : _ how can @xmath0 spheres of equal radius @xmath2 touch a given central sphere of radius @xmath8 , in what patterns , and how are these patterns related ?",
    "in other words , what is the topology of the corresponding configuration space of such spheres ? _ in this paper we review the remarkable history of this problem in several contexts , survey aspects of what is currently known about it , and present some new results and conjectures .",
    "this problem has come up in physics and materials science .",
    "many atoms and molecules are roughly spherical , and their local interactions are governed by how many of them can get close to a single atom .",
    "the arrangements possible for @xmath6 nearby spheres , and allowable motions between them , are relevant to the nature of local interactions , to measuring the entropy of local configurations , and to phase changes in certain materials .",
    "we are particularly motivated by a statement of frank ( 1952 ) made in the context of supercooling of fluids , given in section  [ sec:27 ] .",
    "insisting that exactly @xmath0 equal spheres touch a @xmath6-th central sphere , possibly of a different radius , gives a mathematical toy problem that can be subjected to careful analysis .    as a mathematical problem ,",
    "the @xmath0 spheres problem has both a metric geometry aspect and a topology aspect .",
    "lszl fejes tth made major contributions to the metric geometry of the problem , which concerns extremal questions , formulated as densest packing problems . in connection with the tammes problem , described in section  [ sec:3 ] , he found the largest radius of @xmath0 spheres that can touch a central sphere of radius @xmath8 , realized by the dodecahedral configuration @xmath9 , and found other extremal configurations of touching spheres for smaller  @xmath3 .",
    "he posed the dodecahedral conjecture concerning the minimal volume voronoi cell in a unit sphere packing , and posed another conjecture characterizing all configurations that pack space with every sphere having exactly @xmath0 neighboring spheres .",
    "both of these conjectures are now proved .",
    "the topological side of the @xmath0 spheres problem concerns allowable motions and rearrangements of configurations of spheres , and topological constraints on them .",
    "a major part of this paper addresses the topological side of the problem , concerning the topology of configuration spaces , and the change of topology as the radius @xmath2 is varied .",
    "the arrangements of the @xmath0 touching spheres are encoded in the associated _ configuration space _ of @xmath0-tuples of points on the surface of a unit sphere that remain at a suitable distance from each other .",
    "this space has nontrivial topology and geometry . in topology",
    "the general subject of configuration spaces started in the 1960s with the consideration of topological spaces whose points denote configurations of a fixed number  @xmath3 of labeled points on a manifold .",
    "this paper considers the _ constrained _ configuration space @xmath10 $ ] of @xmath3 non - overlapping spheres of radius @xmath2 which touch a central sphere @xmath11 of radius @xmath8 , centered at the origin .",
    "( here `` non - overlapping '' means the spheres have disjoint interiors . )",
    "it can also be visualized as the space of @xmath3 spherical caps on the sphere , which are obtained as the radial projection of the external spheres onto the surface of the central sphere , whose _ angular diameter _",
    "@xmath12 is a known function of @xmath2 .",
    "the centers of these caps define a constrained @xmath3-configuration on @xmath11 where no pair of points can approach closer than angular separation @xmath13 . for generic ( `` non - critical '' ) values of  @xmath2 for a range of values",
    "@xmath14 , this space is a compact @xmath15-dimensional manifold with boundary , not necessarily connected .",
    "the group @xmath16 acts as global symmetries of @xmath10 $ ] by rigidly rotating the @xmath3-configuration of spheres touching the central sphere .",
    "the _ reduced constrained configuration space _ @xmath17 = { \\operatorname{conf}}(n)[r]/so(3)$ ] is obtained by identifying rotationally equivalent configurations . for generic values of @xmath2",
    "it is a compact @xmath18-dimensional manifold with boundary ; for the case of @xmath0 spheres this is a @xmath19-dimensional manifold .",
    "the subject of constrained configuration spaces has in part been developed for applications to fields such as robotics .",
    "for an introduction to the robotics aspect , see generally abrams and ghrist  @xcite or farber  @xcite .",
    "this paper surveys results for small @xmath3 on the metric geometry problem of determining the maximum allowable radius @xmath5 for @xmath10 $ ] ( equivalently @xmath20 $ ] ) to be nonempty ; this is a variant of the tammes problem , also treated in the literature under the name _ optimal spherical codes _ ( see section  [ sec:3 ] ) .",
    "this paper also studies the topology of configuration spaces of a fixed radius @xmath2 , and the changes in topology in such spaces as the radius @xmath2 is varied . in the latter case the configuration space changes topology at a set of _ critical radius values_. associated to these special values",
    "are _ critical configurations _ , which are extremal in a suitable sense .",
    "the change in topology is described by a generalization of morse theory applicable to the radius function  @xmath2 , which we discuss in section  [ sec:4 ] . to determine these changes",
    "one studies the occurrence and structure of the critical configurations .",
    "the simplest example of such topology change concerns the connectivity of the space of configurations as a function of @xmath2 , reported by the rank of the @xmath21-th homology group of the configuration space .",
    "the @xmath0 spheres problem includes as its most important special case that of unit spheres , where the sphere radius @xmath22 .",
    "this special case is the one relevant to sphere packing in dimension @xmath7 .",
    "we treat the topological space @xmath23 $ ] in sections  [ sec:5 ] and  [ sec:6 ] , and formulate several conjectures related to it .",
    "the radius @xmath22 is a critical radius , and two configurations @xmath24 and @xmath25 on the boundary of the space @xmath23 $ ] are critical configurations .",
    "the topology of @xmath23 $ ] appears to be very complicated , and its cohomology groups have not been determined . in section  [ sec:6 ]",
    "we describe how it is possible to move in the space @xmath23 $ ] to deform any dodecahedral configuration @xmath9 of @xmath0 labeled spheres to any other labeled @xmath9 configuration , permuting the @xmath0 spheres arbitrarily , a result due to conway and sloane .",
    "this suggests the ( folklore ) conjecture asserting that @xmath22 is the largest radius value for which the configuration space @xmath26 $ ] is connected , i.e. it is the largest  @xmath2 for which the @xmath21-th cohomology group of @xmath26 $ ] has rank @xmath8 .",
    "this paper establishes some new results .",
    "it makes the observation ( in section  [ sec:43a ] ) that the family of @xmath27-configurations of spheres achieving @xmath28 ( see figure  [ fig : example5 ] ) is topologically complex .",
    "it completely determines ( in section  [ sec:47 ] ) the cohomology of @xmath29 $ ] for allowable @xmath2 .",
    "it makes precise the notion of @xmath3-configurations being _",
    "critical for maximizing _ the injectivity radius on @xmath30 , and provides a necessary and sufficient _ balancing condition _",
    "( theorem  [ thm : converse ] ) for criticality , prefatory to a `` morse theory '' for such min - type functions  @xcite . and",
    "it formulates several new conjectures in sections  [ sec:65 ] and  [ sec66 ] .",
    "configuration spaces are of interest in physics and materials science .",
    "jammed configurations are a granular materials criterion for a stable packing . according to torquato and stillinger",
    "@xcite they are : `` particle configurations in which each particle is in contact with its nearest neighbors in such a way that mechanical stability of a specific type is conferred to the packing . '' packings of rigid disks and spheres have been studied extensively by simulation ( lubachevsky and stillinger  @xcite , donev  et  al .  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been empirically discovered that randomly ordered hard spheres achieve in random close packing a density around @xmath31 percent  @xcite , and pass through a jamming transition around @xmath32 percent  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a jamming phase transition , signaled by a change in shear modulus , and the formation of a glass state , is relevant in studying the behavior of colloidal suspensions and granular materials .",
    "the large rearrangement of structure required in making a phase transition is relevant in the phenomenon of supercooling of liquids ( see section  [ sec:27 ] ) .",
    "the nature of glass transitions has been called `` the deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in solid state theory '' ( anderson  @xcite ) . for articles and reviews of these topics , see generally ediger  et  al .",
    "@xcite , ohern  et  al .",
    "@xcite , and liu and nagel  @xcite . for a survey of hard sphere models , including the idea of a liquid - solid phase transition in packings ,",
    "see generally lwen  @xcite .",
    "one may make an analogy between the configuration spaces @xmath17 $ ] treated here and a sphere packing model for jamming studied in  @xcite , which treats spheres having repulsive local potential at zero density and zero applied stress , and includes hard spheres for one model parameter value . in the latter model ,",
    "the order parameter is the packing fraction of the spheres . in the configuration space model ,",
    "a proxy value for the packing fraction is the radius parameter @xmath2 , which determines the fraction of surface area of @xmath11 covered by the  @xmath3 spherical caps .",
    "an analogue of the jamming transition value in the configuration space model is then the maximal radius @xmath33 at which the constrained configuration space @xmath17 $ ] remains connected ; this property is detected by the @xmath21-th cohomology group .",
    "finer topological invariants of this kind are then supplied by the various critical values @xmath34 at which the ranks of the individual cohomology groups @xmath35 , { { \\mathbb q}})$ ] change .",
    "our configuration model is simplified in being @xmath36-dimensional , with constrained configurations on the surface of a @xmath36-sphere @xmath11 , which , however , has the new feature of positive curvature , giving a compact constrained configuration space . for the jamming problem itself ,",
    "the space of ( constrained ) configurations of hard spheres in a large @xmath7-dimensional box seems a more appropriate space .",
    "the general direction of inquiry investigating the transition of topological invariants ( like betti numbers ) of configuration spaces as the radius parameter is varying could shed new light on the nature of jamming transitions .",
    "for further remarks , see section  [ sec:7 ] .",
    "this paper is mainly of a survey nature , and the sections of the paper have been written to be independently readable .",
    "section  [ sec:2 ] gives a brief history of results on the @xmath0 spheres problem and sphere packing .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] surveys results on the maximal radius  @xmath37 for configurations of @xmath3 equal spheres touching a central sphere of radius @xmath8 for small @xmath3 .",
    "this problem is equivalent to the tammes problem .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] begins with the topology of configuration spaces of @xmath3 points in @xmath38 and on the @xmath36-sphere @xmath11 , corresponding to radius @xmath39 .",
    "it then considers spaces of configurations of equal spheres of radius @xmath2 touching a sphere of radius @xmath8 for variable @xmath40 .",
    "it defines a notion of critical configuration in the spirit of min - type morse theory .",
    "section  [ sec:5 ] discusses the special configuration space of @xmath0 unit spheres touching a @xmath6-th central sphere , i.e. the case of radius @xmath22 .",
    "it focuses on properties of the @xmath24 configuration , the @xmath25 configuration and the dodecahedral configuration @xmath9 .",
    "it shows that the @xmath24 and @xmath25 configurations are critical ( in the sense of section  [ sec:42 ] ) in the reduced configuration spaces @xmath23 $ ] . and",
    "it shows that there are continuous deformations between a dodecahedral configuration to an @xmath24 configuration and to an @xmath25 configuration in the reduced configuration space @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "section  [ sec:6 ] considers the problem of permutability of the spheres of the dodecahedral configuration for @xmath22 , conjecturing that @xmath23 $ ] is connected , and that this is the largest value of @xmath2 where connectedness holds .",
    "it also considers the @xmath41 case and formulates several conjectures about disconnectedness .",
    "section  [ sec:7 ] makes some concluding remarks .",
    "we begin with some historical vignettes concerning configurations of @xmath0 spheres touching a central sphere , as they have come up in physics , astronomy , biology and materials science .",
    "johannes kepler  ( 15711630 ) studied packings and crystals in his 1611 pamphlet `` the six - cornered snowflake ''  @xcite . in it",
    "he asserts that the densest sphere packing of equal spheres is the @xmath24 packing , or `` cannonball packing . ''",

    "the packing will be the tightest possible , so that in no other arrangement could more pellets be stuffed into the same container . ] _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

    "in addition , this analysis shows that each of these is a _ local cut point _",
    ", a point of a space which when removed , disconnects a small open neighborhood of the point .",

    "we next note that the five `` bottlenecks '' in the @xmath27-move lead to the possibility of connected components not containing any @xmath9 configuration , for certain ranges of @xmath2 . during the @xmath483 move joining two @xmath9 configurations , there are @xmath27 bottlenecks all through which one can pass at least up to a radius @xmath558 .",
    "there is however room for configurations of spheres of larger radius occurring between the bottlenecks .",
    "if we increase the radius above the smallest two of the bottleneck radii , it may be possible for a sphere to get stuck in the middle of one of these regions , so it can neither go backwards nor forwards via the @xmath482-move to a @xmath9 configuration . assuming that `` trapped '' configurations ( from blocking of the @xmath483 move ) exist containing no @xmath9 configuration , eventually as we increase @xmath2 some `` trapped '' configuration must become a critical configuration",

    "the experimenters were unable to detect that the radii at which the @xmath482-move and the @xmath379-move permutation cease being feasible are in fact different ( as discussed in section  [ sec:64 ] ) .",
    "study of the jamming problem leads the sub - problem concerning what is a good notion of rigidity for such configurations .",
    "there is a notion of `` locally jammed configuration '' in which no particle can move if its neighbors are fixed .",
    "the tammes problem or ( extremal ) spherical codes problem , of determining @xmath5 is analogous to determining maximally dense jammed configurations of spheres in a box .",

    "in configuration theory models like @xmath17 $ ] of this paper , certain critical configurations at critical values of the radius parameter might serve as a proxy for jammed configurations , with the balancing condition in theorem  [ thm : converse ] capturing the locally jammed condition .",
    "perhaps only a subclass of critical configurations should be interpreted as jammed , for example those that are local maxima of the radius function .",
    "to unlock the @xmath24 configuration , a good way is to do it with the help of a friend , hereafter called charles .",
    "please follow these steps :    1 .",
    "ask charles to hold the @xmath7 north balls and the @xmath7 south balls firmly in their positions .",
    "these @xmath314 polar balls remain fixed during the whole process . as a result , the @xmath6-th central ball stays fixed as well .",
    "2 .   roll the remaining @xmath314 equatorial balls in a direction roughly parallel to the equator .",
    "if properly lubricated , this does not require a big effort .",
    "the equatorial balls can all be pushed either to the east or to the west , in a coordinated way .",
    "4 .   at all times",
    "you must ensure the @xmath314 rolling balls touch the central ball .",
    "this requires some practice , but it is possible and not terribly hard .",
    "observe that the @xmath314 balls roll around the central ball along the equatorial `` valley '' between the polar balls kept fixed by charles .",
    "these rolling balls can not always move equatorially , but instead move north and south slightly , in an alternating manner , as you roll them .",
    "6 .   because the @xmath314 rolling balls move north and south , some of them do not touch each other any more : free space may appear between them . also , some space can be created between them and the @xmath314 balls kept fixed by charles",
    "this is normal .",
    "as you proceed by @xmath565 the @xmath314 rolling balls realign in the equatorial plane , touching each other and the polar balls .",
    "note that at this moment the configuration is locked back into @xmath24 .",
    "each of the @xmath314 rolled balls is touching two of its equatorial neighbors , one ball to the north and one ball to the south .",
    "unlocking the @xmath25 configuration is similar to the @xmath24 configuration , except that charles has somewhat more to do",
    ". please follow these steps :    1 .",
    "ask charles to hold firmly the three north balls and the three south balls .",
    "the three south balls will remain fixed during the whole process .",
    "but the north triangle has to be rotated as a whole in its plane , at some constant speed , which can be either eastward or westward ( there are two choices ) .",
    "it will move through an angle  @xmath566 .",
    "the @xmath6-th central ball stays fixed as before .",
    "roll all the remaining @xmath314 balls in the ( roughly same ) equatorial direction as the north triangle is rotating .",
    "this movement direction is forced on all six equatorial balls by the motion of the north triangle .",
    "the rest of the process goes basically in the same way as for the @xmath24 configuration .",
    "as charles proceeds to rotate the north triangle by @xmath184 , you proceed by @xmath565 the six middle balls align back into the equatorial plane , touching each other and the six polar balls .",
    "note that at this moment the configuration is locked back into the @xmath25 configuration .",
    "each of the @xmath314 rolled balls is touching two of its equatorial neighbors , one ball to the north and one ball to the south .",
    "note that for @xmath24 , the equatorial balls underwent cyclic permutation of length @xmath314 . for @xmath25 , the equatorial balls underwent a cyclic permutation of length @xmath314 and the @xmath7 northern balls a cyclic permutation of length @xmath7 .",
    "these give odd permutations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
