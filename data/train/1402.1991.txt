    "the universality of critical exponents is an important and remarkably elegant property of standard second order transitions , which has been explored in great detail through the renormalization group theory ( rgt ) .",
    "the universality hypothesis states that for all systems within a universality class the critical exponents are rigorously identical and do not depend on the microscopic parameters of the model",
    ". however , universality is not strictly universal ; there are known eccentricmodels which are exceptions and violate the universality rule in the sense that their critical exponents vary continuously as functions of a control variable .",
    "the most famous example is the eight vertex model solved exactly by baxter @xcite .",
    "the exceptional physical conditions which apply in this case were discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for ising spin glasses ( isgs ) ,",
    "the form of the interaction distribution is a microscopic control parameter .",
    "it has been assumed tacitly or explicitly that the members of the isg family of transitions obey standard universality rules , following the generally accepted statement that empirically , one finds that all systems in nature belong to one of a comparatively small number of universality classes@xcite .",
    "one should underline the word empirically ; we know of no formal proof that universality must hold in isgs .",
    "it was found thirty years ago that the @xmath6-expansion for the critical exponents @xcite in isgs is not predictive since the first few orders have a non - convergent behavior and higher orders are not known .",
    "this can be taken as an indication that a fundamentally different theoretical approach is required for rgt at spin glass transitions .",
    "indeed `` classical tools of rgt analysis are not suitable for spin glasses '' @xcite , although no explicit theoretical predictions have been made so far concerning universality .",
    "isg transition simulations are much more demanding numerically than are those on , say , pure ferromagnet transitions with no interaction disorder .",
    "the traditional approach in isgs has been to study the temperature and size dependence of observables in the near - transition region and to estimate the critical temperature and exponents through finite size scaling ( fss ) relations after taking means over large numbers of samples .",
    "finite size corrections to scaling must be allowed for explicitly which can be delicate . from numerical data , claims of universality have been made repeatedly for isgs @xcite even though the estimates of the critical exponents have varied considerably over the years ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a tabulation of historic estimates ) .    on this fss approach",
    "the critical inverse temperature @xmath7 estimates are very important for deducing reliable values for the critical exponents @xcite . here",
    "we also obtain independent estimates for @xmath7 and for the exponent @xmath1 through the thermodynamic derivative peak ( pseudocritical temperature ) technique .",
    "the estimates for @xmath7 and for @xmath1 from this analysis can be considered to be independent of each other and the correction to scaling only plays a minor role . with the best estimates for @xmath7 in hand the numerical data in the thermodynamic limit ( thl ) regime",
    "are then analysed with the scaling variable @xmath8 appropriate to isgs , together with scaling expressions which cover the entire paramagnetic temperature regime rather than being limited to the narrow critical region @xcite .",
    "once values for all critical parameters have been obtained by combining information from fss , pseudocritical temperature , and thl data , through the privman - fisher ansatz @xcite compact scaling expressions can be obtained covering the entire paramagnetic temperature range and all sizes @xmath3 .    from a comparison of the critical values for dimensionless parameters and for the critical exponent values ,",
    "each of which is characteristic of a universality class , we conclude that the gaussian , laplacian and bimodal isgs in dimension four are not in the same universality class .",
    "this counter example to the general rule implies that universality does not hold in isgs .",
    "it is relevant that it has already been shown experimentally that in heisenberg spin glasses the critical exponents depend on the strength of the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is as usual @xmath9 with the near neighbor symmetric distributions normalized to @xmath10 .",
    "the ising spins live on simple hyper - cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have studied the bimodal ( j@xmath4d ) model with a @xmath11 interaction distribution , gaussian ( g@xmath4d ) model with a @xmath12 interaction distribution , and laplacian ( l@xmath4d ) model with a @xmath13 ) interaction distribution , all in dimension @xmath4 .",
    "we will compare with published measurements on @xmath4d isgs .",
    "the simulations were carried out using the exchange monte - carlo method for equilibration using so called multi - spin coding , on @xmath14 ( up to @xmath15 ) or @xmath16 for larger @xmath3 individual samples at each size .",
    "an exchange was attempted after every sweep with a success rate of at least 30% .",
    "at least 40 temperatures were used forming a geometric progression reaching down to @xmath17 for j4d , @xmath18 for g4d and @xmath19 for l4d .",
    "this ensures that our data span the critical temperature region which is essential for the fss fits .",
    "near the critical temperature the @xmath20 step length was at most @xmath21 .",
    "the various systems were deemed to have reached equilibrium when the sample average susceptibility for the lowest temperature showed no trend between runs .",
    "for example , for @xmath22 this means about @xmath23 sweep - exchange steps .",
    "after equilibration , at least @xmath23 measurements were made for each sample for all sizes , taking place after every sweep - exchange step .",

    "the statistical errors in both sizes @xmath3 and @xmath44 contribute to the uncertainty of the crossing temperature ; the scaling correction to the smaller size @xmath3 dominates and is combined with the numerical difficulty in equilibrating at the larger size @xmath44 .",
    "instead we interpolate using the data points for each @xmath32 so as to obtain sets of data @xmath45 for a few fixed @xmath46 in the critical region , after making a first rough estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "( it is important to span the range of temperatures on both sides of the true @xmath0 ) .",
    "we then make a global fit with the standard fss expression , valid in the critical region if there is a single dominant scaling correction term : @xmath47 the fit uses all the fss region data , and gives output estimates , with error bars , for @xmath7 and the critical exponents @xmath1 and @xmath48 .",
    "the parameters of eq .  , and their error bars at the 95% level , were found by using mathematica s built - in routines for nonlinear model fitting .",
    "the data points for each @xmath49 were obtained at some 20 fixed @xmath46 near @xmath7 @xmath50 , using cubic spline interpolation .",
    "thus the six parameters are based on some 200 - 300 data points from different @xmath20 and @xmath3 .",
    "the quality of the fit is checked by looking at not only the adjusted r - square index , which is always extremely close to 1 in our fits .",
    "a better test is to see whether the distribution of deviations between data and fitted model , so called standardized residuals , can be considered zero by using mathematica s built - in zero - location tests , using the sign - test or t - test .",

    "we will give a detailed discussion of scaling in ferromagnets and in isgs in the thermodynamic limit ( thl ) regime , using the scaling variable @xmath64 in ferromagnets and @xmath65 in isgs @xcite , as this approach has been widely misunderstood or simply ignored .",

    "are almost always analysed using @xmath69 as the scaling variable , following the standard critical regime prescription of the renormalization group theory ( rgt ) . in particular",
    "@xmath70 scaling has been used in recent isg studies @xcite .",
    "however with this variable , explicit analyses of numerical data are limited to the finite size scaling @xmath71 regime within a narrow critical region in temperature ; @xmath70 diverges at infinite temperature , so when @xmath70 is used outside the critical temperature region , corrections to scaling inevitably proliferate .    in ferromagnets , for well over fifty years",
    "the scaling variable @xmath72 has been used for the analysis of the high temperature scaling expansion ( htse ) for the susceptibility ; in particular the scaling variable @xmath73 was used in the original discussion of confluent corrections to scaling in ferromagnets by wegner @xcite which led to the important thl susceptibility expression @xmath74 the first correction term is the confluent correction and the second an analytic correction .    in the critical region",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath70 become equivalent , but as @xmath75 at infinite temperature ( where @xmath76 ) instead of diverging , the @xmath73 expression is well controlled over the whole paramagnetic regime . in principle",
    "there can be many correction terms in eq .",
    "but in practice to high precision a leading term and one single further effective correction term are generally sufficient for an analysis at the level of precision of numerical data .",
    "this is because the leading terms in the htse provide strict closure conditions on the eq .",
    "thus for the canonical ising ferromagnet in dimension two , there are five or more further well identified correction terms @xcite but in practice with one single weak effective correction term beyond the leading term , the expression eq .",
