    "the study of planetary nebulae ( pne ) beyond the local group has largely been conducted in luminous early - type galaxies where pne are present in large numbers and are relatively easy to detect .",
    "the nearest , easily observable elliptical galaxy , ngc  5128 ( cen  a ) , has thus been a recurring target for pn studies over the last twenty years . at a distance of 3.54",
    "mpc ( e.g.  hui et al .",
    "1993a ; harris et al .",
    "1999 ; rejkuba 2004 ) , ngc  5128 is @xmath1  mag closer than the ellipticals in the virgo cluster , which not only makes intrinsically fainter pne more accessible , it also greatly reduces the problem of contamination from ly@xmath0 galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "the galaxy is also interesting in its own right as it is clearly the product of a recent merger , exhibiting a warped central gas and dust disk , stellar and hi shells , and both radio and x - ray jets .",
    "a thorough review of this galaxy is presented by israel ( 1998 ) . aside from its intrinsic complexity , disadvantages of studying ngc  5128 include its large extent on the sky ( @xmath3  kpc ) , and its relatively low galactic latitude ( @xmath4 ) . nevertheless , modern wide - field and multiplexing instrumentation have made studies both practical and fruitful .",
    "the first pn survey of ngc  5128 was conducted by hui et al .",
    "( 1993b ) , and covered 661  arcmin@xmath5 over 43 ccd fields ( see figure  [ fig : fields ] ) .",
    "this coverage extended 20  kpc along the major axis an 10  kpc along the minor axis . at these projected distances ( @xmath6 and 2  @xmath7 , respectively ) pne",
    "were detected well beyond the radii at which long - slit spectroscopy was readily obtainable .",
    "they identified 785 pn candidates using the method of on-/off - band imaging of the [ oiii]@xmath8 emission line .",
    "these pne formed a complete sample for brightest 1.5  mag of the pn luminosity function ( pnlf ) .",
    "they also spectroscopically confirmed 432 pne , on which they based their dynamical studies of dark matter and the intrinsic shape of the potential ( hui et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "larger ccd cameras and fiber spectrographs allowed us to conduct a second , wider pn survey of the ngc  5128 halo .",
    "this survey covered nearly 3  deg@xmath5 on the sky and extended to 100  kpc along the major axis and 40  kpc along the minor axis ( figure  1 ) . in total , we increased the number of imaged pne to 1141 , 780 of which are spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "the spatial distribution of pne is concentrated toward the major axis , mirrors that of the low surface brightness halo light seen in deep photographic imaging by malin ( 1978 ) , although the most distant pne in our sample are @xmath9  kpc beyond the light seen in the photographic images .",
    "pne are some of the most effective kinematic tracers in the halos of elliptical galaxies , where their radial velocities can be used to constrain the dynamical mass of their parent galaxies ( e.g. arnaboldi et al .",
    "1998 ; romanowsky et al .",
    "hui et al .",
    "( 1993 ) used the original sample of 432 pn velocities to derive a total mass of @xmath10 and @xmath11 out to a radius of 25  kpc .",
    "our recent work , which extends out to 80  kpc , shows that the total mass increases only slowly with radius .",
    "the fitted major axis rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile are shown in figure  [ fig : rotsig ] .",
    "although the rotation curve remains flat , the dispersion profile falls with radius . within this volume",
    ", we estimate a dynamical mass of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( peng et al .",
    "these numbers are relatively unchanged whether we use the tracer mass estimator ( evans et al .  2003 ) or spherical jeans equation under the assumption of isotropy . while it may be that this value for @xmath14 can be produced from theoretical expectations ( see napolitano , this volume ) , the value we derive is certainly low , like the ones seen in the sample of romanowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , when compared to luminous ellipticals such as m87 and m49 ( ct et al .  2001 , 2003 )",
    "one of the advantages of using pne as kinematic probes is that we get full two - dimensional spatial information on the stellar velocity field .",
    "when there are hundreds of measured pne , we can construct velocity maps that are similar to those derived from integral field spectrograph observations , but that extend much farther out into the halo . in the case of ngc  5128 , hui et al .",
    "( 1995 ) determined that the kinematic axis of rotation was not aligned with either of the photometric axes , suggesting that the intrinsic shape of the potential is triaxial .",
    "since then , we have used our more extensive pn data to show that the zero - velocity surface not only does not coincide with the photometric axes , but is in fact twisted in an s-shape ( figure  [ fig : vfield ] ) .",
    "this severe twist , which asymptotes to a minor axis angle of 83  degrees , suggests that the potential could be triaxial , tending toward prolate ( statler 1991 ) .",
    "separate lines of evidence , which include our survey of globular clusters in this system ( peng et al .",
    "2004b ) indicate that there may be a substantial intermediate age population of stars with an mean age of @xmath15  gyr ( peng et al .",
    "bekki et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have already produced simulations of globular cluster velocity fields that result from galaxy mergers . in the future",
    ", it will be valuable to compare the pn velocity field to those produced by merger simulations to constrain the types of mergers that could have produced this galaxy .    .",
    "pn with velocities larger than systemic ( receding ) are represented by crosses , and those with velocities smaller than systemic ( approaching ) are represented by open boxes .",
    "the color of each point shows the magnitude of the velocity with respect to systemic .",
    "notice how the rapid major axis rotation is only present within @xmath16 degrees of the major axis , while the rest of the galaxy halo undergoes a slower minor axis rotation . ]",
    "one of the useful characteristics of pne is that , like globular clusters , it is possible in priniple to obtain both their radial velocities _ and _ some information on their ages or abundances , producing a chemodynamical picture of the galaxy .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the field star population of ngc  5128 has been measured using hubble space telescope color - magnitude diagrams of the red giants and is generally metal - rich ( harris & harris 2002 ) .",
    "assuming that the pne trace the same stellar population , this is one way to derive the overall properties of the pn system .",
    "however , one can derive abundances from pne directly from their emission line spectra , although this requires a significant investment in observing time .    through a heroic effort , walsh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) derived [ o / h ] for 5 pne in ngc  5128 , finding that they were generally sub - solar in abundance with a mean value of @xmath17 .",
    "walsh ( this volume ) has also recently obtained spectra of much higher quality for @xmath18 pne , showing that these types of observations are now possible and interesting .",
    "another way to link pne with their progenitor stellar populations is to find pne in globular clusters .",
    "minniti & rejkuba ( 2002 ) found one such object in an ngc  5128 globular cluster .",
    "however , these objects appear to be rare , and no other pne in extragalactic clusters have been reported .",
    "we have investigated the pn population in ngc  5128 by looking for the young , peimbert ( 1978 ) type  i pne , which should have progenitors that are younger than 12  gyr . in the milky way , these pne are found in the disk , and are rich in n and he due to the dredge - up and hot - bottom burning processes found only in these more massive stars .",
    "because obtaining spectra of sufficient quality to derive n or he abundances would have been prohibitively expensive , we instead chose to measure the [ nii ] lines @xmath19 and compare their fluxes to h@xmath0 .",
    "this [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratio can be used as a crude estimator of relative nitrogen abundance .",
    "type  i pne in both magellanic clouds have very high [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratios .",
    "we used the 2-degree field spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope to observe 221 pne in ngc  5128 .",
    "of these , we detected h@xmath0 at @xmath20-sigma in nearly all of them ( 219 ) , and both h@xmath0 and [ nii]@xmath21 in 134 pne .",
    "because these were fiber observations and some of the pne sit atop the bright galaxy continuum , it was also important that we model the galaxy and subtract it off . in order to do this , we used the models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) to obtain a best fit simple stellar population to the blue side of the spectrum ( used in peng et al .",
    "we then scaled this model to the appropriate flux level , and shifted it to the expected mean velocity at that position , as derived from our 2-d pne velocity field .",
    "only after this continuum subtraction did we measure the line fluxes .",
    "our sample is complete for all values greater than @xmath22 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : n2hahist ] shows the distribution of measured [ nii]/h@xmath0 values , with incompleteness setting in for values less than @xmath22 . in order to determine whether any pne at the high end of the distribution could plausibly be of type  i , we compared them to the extragalactic pne found in the magellanic clouds ( stanghellini et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) , m31 ( jacoby & ciardullo 1999 ) , and ngc  5128 ( walsh et al .",
    "1999 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : n2hamo3_log ] , we plot the value of [ nii]/h@xmath0 against the brightness in [ oiii]@xmath8 .",
    "a general trend in metallicity is evident with the smc being most metal - poor , and ngc  5128 being most metal - rich .",
    "it is known that the type  i pne in the clouds are typically faint , and this is seen here , where the objects that have high [ nii]/h@xmath0 ( relative to the galaxy mean ) are all at the faint end .",
    "these pne can have [ nii]/h@xmath0 values that are @xmath23  times higher than what is typical in these galaxies .",
    "in ngc  5128 , however , while the overall population has fairly high [ nii]/h@xmath0 values , we see no evidence for outliers that would be good candidate type  i pne .",
    "even the pn from walsh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that was tentatively determined to be type  i , does not stand out from the crowd .",
    "it is important to note that the cutoff values of n / o and he / h typically used to define type  i pne are defined only for the galaxy , and may not apply to systems of different metallicities .    /h@xmath0",
    "versus m@xmath24 .",
    "ngc  5128 values ( points with error bars ) show no evidence for obvious type  i pne .",
    "gray points are those for which we can only derive an upper limit for [ nii / h@xmath0 . ]",
    "only in the milky way and m31 are there more known pne than in ngc  5128 . starting with hui et al .",
    "( 1993a ) , extragalactic pn studies in ngc  5128 have addressed a wide array of issues from its distance , dark matter content , stellar populations , and formation history .",
    "we now know that while the halo of this galaxy does contain dark matter , it falls into a growing class of elliptical galaxies that have low to moderate mass - to - light ratios .",
    "it s 2-dimensional halo kinematics are consistent with a triaxial potential , and a galaxy that was formed in a recent merger .",
    "however , this merger was likely not so recent as to have produced many stars younger than @xmath25  gyr that would now be detectable as type  i pne .",
    "future deep , wide - field imaging and spectroscopy will be able to probe the pn abundance distribution and the star formation history of this galaxy , as well as enable studies of the pn stage of stellar evolution in an entirely different environment from that in the local group ."
