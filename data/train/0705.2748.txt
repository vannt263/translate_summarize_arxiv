    "the study of the mechanism of the fusion - fission process in the reactions with massive nuclei is of interest of both experimentalists and theorists to obtain a favorable way of the synthesis of superheavy elements or exotic nuclei far from the stability line .",
    "the last experiments on the synthesis of superheavy elements @xmath5=114 , 115 , 116 and 118 were successful at beam energies corresponding to 35 - 40 mev excitation energies of the compound nucleus which is enough higher than the bass barrier .",
    "the deformed actinide nuclei were used as targets at synthesis of new superheavy nuclei in the @xmath6ca + @xmath1u , @xmath7pu , @xmath8 cm reactions @xcite .",
    "it means that the orientation angle of the symmetry axis of target - nucleus relative to the beam direction affects on the fusion - fission mechanism .",
    "the cross sections of events corresponding to the synthesis of superheavy elements are not higher than few picobarns @xcite and the width of evaporation residues excitation function is very narrow . at the same time",
    "the measured cross sections of the fission fragments are several tens of millibarn @xcite and the excitation function of fission fragments yields is very wide .",
    "it means that only a very small part of collisions in the narrow range of the beam energy leads to the formation of the evaporation residues considered as superheavy elements .",
    "the problem is to establish this small range of beam energy as the optimal condition for the synthesis of superheavies .",
    "the main reason leading to the small values of the evaporation residue cross - sections seems to be connected with the small survival probability @xmath9 of the heated compound nucleus against fission by evaporating neutrons .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath9 decreases by an increase of the excitation energy @xmath10 and angular momentum @xmath11 of the compound nucleus @xcite .",
    "but the formation of the compound nucleus in reactions with massive nuclei has a hindrance : not all of the dinuclear systems formed at capture of the projectile by the target - nucleus can be transformed into compound nuclei .",
    "we should stress that the estimation of the formation probability is difficult by both experimental and theoretical methods .",
    "the determination of the fusion probability from the experimental data is ambiguous due to the difficulties to identify pure fission fragments of the splitting compound nucleus from the fragments which are formed in other processes of heavy - ion collisions like fast - fission , quasifission and deep inelastic collisions . by the way , restoration of its value from the cross - sections of evaporation residues",
    "is model - dependent . as a result",
    "there is a field for speculations which can be clarified indirectly by the analysis of the physical results connected with the formation of the compound nucleus .",
    "the angular distribution of reaction fragments is one of the informative quantity allowing us to study the fusion - fission mechanism of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to show the ability of the method based on the dinuclear system ( dns ) concept to calculate the angular momentum distribution for the fusion - fission and quasifission fragments by analyzing the anisotropy of the angular distribution of both fusion - fission and quasifission fragments in reactions with deformed and nearly spherical target nuclei .",
    "the partial capture , fusion and quasifission excitation functions , as well as the corresponding mean square values of angular momentum calculated in this work were used to determine the anisotropy @xmath12 of the fragment angular distribution by formula ( [ anisa ] ) as a function of the spin distribution of the fissioning systems : compound nucleus and dinuclear system .",
    "the results were compared with the experimental data for the observed anisotropy @xmath12 of the angular distributions of fragments of the @xmath0o+@xmath1u , @xmath2f+@xmath3pb and @xmath4s+@xmath3pb reactions .",

    "[ concl ] .",
    "generally , authors analyzing the experimental data determine the fission cross sections by fitting of the measured angular distributions of the fission fragments . to generate the angular momentum distributions required to predict the shape of the fission angular distributions , the approximate fusion cross sections is used ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper ,",
    "the  restored \" fission angular distributions were used again and fitted to the measured data for the @xmath2f+@xmath3pb reactions . from the final fits the anisotropies @xmath12 and the fusion - fission cross sections as well as the value of @xmath14 at each bombarding energy were determined . in such an analysis , it was implicitly assumed that @xmath14 is independent * on * the total spin @xmath15 .",
    "the main conclusion of the authors was that the anisotropy at the highest bombarding energies can only be reproduced by assuming that the fission barrier does no longer control the fission process when its height is less than the nuclear temperature .",
    "the role of the quasifission process was not discussed in @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the fission fragment anisotropies and mass distributions were measured over a wide range of angles for the @xmath0o+@xmath1u reaction .",
    "the authors concluded that a systematic deviation of the measured fission fragment anisotropies from the transition state model predictions confirms the validity of the correlating anomalously large anisotropies with the presence of quasifission . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "the sensitivity of the features of fission - fragment angular distributions to nonequilibrium processes such as quasifission was shown by a quantitative analysis of the angular distributions of near - symmetric masses produced in the @xmath4s+@xmath3pb reaction .",
    "the study of correlations between mass and angular distribution of fragments of full momentum transfer reactions allows us to separate the pure fission fragments of the compound nucleus with a compact shape @xcite .",
    "the mass and angular momentum distributions of the reaction fragments are determined by the dynamics of collision .",
    "the mass distribution strongly depends on the potential energy surface .",
    "quasifission produces fragments alike the fission fragments confusing the estimation of the fusion cross section . in the quasifission process",
    ", the compound nucleus stage is not reached .",
    "the complete kinetic energy relaxation ( capture stage ) is a main characteristics of the quasifission reactions .",
    "it means that quasifission takes place only after the capture of the projectile by the target - nucleus .",
    "the mass equilibrium can be reached or not in dependence on the masses and mass asymmetry of the reactants @xcite , as well as on the dynamics of collision .",
    "the symmetric mass distributions at all angles and symmetric angular distributions relative to @xmath16 are characteristic features for the fission decay of the completely fused system .",
    "the angular distributions of fission fragments are often characterized by the ratio of the yield at @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) to the one at @xmath19 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath20 .",
    "the angular distribution of the fission products is described in the framework of the standard statistical model ( ssm ) usually making use of the fact that the fission saddle - point configuration can be treated as a transition state between the compound system in its quasi - equilibrium state and the two separated fission fragments @xcite .",
    "this model is used under the assumption that the final direction of fragments is given by the orientation of the nuclear symmetry axis as the nucleus passes over the fission saddle - point .",
    "this assumption may not be justified for the heaviest systems for which the saddle- and scission - point configurations have very different shapes .",
    "consequently , in such case , the ssm may not describe properly the angular anisotropy of pure fission fragments in reactions with massive nuclei .",
    "certainly , the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental estimations of the angular anisotropy is caused by an imperfection of the ssm and the experimental difficulties of separating the pure fission fragments .",
    "the models which reproduce the fusion - fission excitation functions fail to account for the fission - fragment angular - distribution data .",
    "the reasons of the failure could be connected with the effects of the entrance channel ( presence of quasifission ) or the fission exit channel ( @xmath21-equili- brium is not reached , where @xmath21 is the projection of the total spin of the nucleus on its axial symmetry axis ) @xcite .",
    "certainly effects of both of above - mentioned phenomena should be analyzed with the increase of the anisotropy @xmath12 in the angular distribution of reaction fragments .",
    "vopkapic and ivanisevic in ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that at sub - barrier energies , fusion of projectile occurs only when the prolate deformed target is oriented in the beam direction , producing a narrow initial @xmath21 distribution peaked around @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath21 equilibration time was also assumed to be not too short compared to the fission time . using of a time dependent and narrow @xmath21 distribution compared to predictions of the statistical saddle - point model could be envisaged and the fragment angular anisotropy could be explained .",
    "the deviation of the experimental angular anisotropy from the statistical model picture at energies above the interaction barrier was discussed by authors of ref .",
    "the reason of the failure of the statistical model to reproduce the measured data was considered doubtful for the application of the ssm at high energies when it is no longer valid if the fission barrier could be passed at the first attempt .",
    "this deviation occurs at large values of angular momenta where the fission barrier height is less than the saddle - point temperature ( @xmath23 mev ) .",
    "it means that all the properties of the fission process should be determined completely by the dynamics of the motion over the potential energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "the measured fission data corresponding to large values of the fragment angular anisotropy @xmath12 can include a contribution of quasifission fragments leading to higher anisotropy than the ones predicted by standard statistical models @xcite since at quasifission the dinuclear system never becomes as compact to be the compound nucleus , and also the @xmath21 equilibration is probably not attained .",
    "the experimental data ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) confirm events with characteristic features , particularly in association with projectiles heavier than @xmath24 mg .",
    "so , there are two main points of view to interpret the experimentally observed angular anisotropy @xmath12 : 1 ) authors of refs .",
    "@xcite and we , in the present paper , explain it with the contribution of the quasifission process competing with the formation of the compound nucleus ; 2 ) authors of ref .",
    "@xcite observe a strict evidence of the anisotropy @xmath12 , explaining such an anomaly by a new version of the preequilibrium fission model @xcite .",
    "calculations within the ssm assume the availability of a realistic spin distribution of the fissioning system . in turn",
    "the calculation of the spin distribution of the compound nucleus formed in the heavy - ion induced reactions is a complicated task .",
    "the extraction of a realistic spin distribution from the measured angular distribution of reaction fragments may be ambiguous due to a sufficient contribution of quasifission .",
    "we consider the role of the entrance channel in the observed angular anisotropy .",
    "the mean square values @xmath25 versus @xmath26 is determined .",
    "we compare our results of @xmath12 with the available estimations extracted from the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of splitting fragments of the rotating system is determined by its angular momentum distribution , namely , by the projection , @xmath21 , of the total spin vector , @xmath15 , onto the center axis of the separated fission fragments and by the moment of inertia of the fissioning system .",
    "the total spin has no component along the beam axis ( @xmath28 ) , if the fissioning system is formed at capture ( full momentum transfer ) of a spinless projectile by a spinless target.we calculate the anisotropy @xmath12 using our results of the angular momentum distributions @xmath13 for the complete fusion and quasifission , and @xmath29 for compound nucleus is found by the rotating finite range model ( rfrm ) by sierk @xcite and for the dns is determined by our model taking into account different mutual orientations of symmetry axes of interacting nuclei .",
    "then we can use the expression for the approximated anisotropy of the fission fragment angular distribution suggested by halpern and strutinski in ref.@xcite and griffin in ref.@xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the effective moment of inertia on the saddle point for the compound nucleus ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 are moments of inertia around the symmetry axis and a perpendicular axis , respectively .",

    "we should note that the maximum of the calculated mass ( charge ) distribution of quasifission fragments is near masses of the projectile - like and target - like fragments of the @xmath2f+@xmath3pb reaction .",
    "the absent of the large anisotropy at the low energies is explained by the fact that the massive target nucleus has the spherical shape and @xmath137 is not so small as in the @xmath0o+@xmath1u reaction .    in fig .",

    "heaviest fragments have a charge larger than @xmath141 and the largest value is @xmath142 .",

    "at the low energies the competition between complete fusion and quasifission is very sensitive to the peculiarities of the potential energy surface .",
    "the height of the intrinsic fusion barrier @xmath60 is comparable with the excitation energy of the dinuclear system and , therefore , there is a hindrance to complete fusion .    at the highest values of beam energy",
    "the hindrance to complete fusion appears due to the increase of @xmath60 as a function of the orbital angular momentum @xmath145 of the dinuclear system . at the same time the quasifission barrier @xmath61 decreases by increasing of @xmath145 .",
    "the combined effect from the behaviour of the @xmath60 and @xmath61 barriers as functions of @xmath145 makes quasifission as the dominant process @xcite .",

    "the fast - fission mechanism also contributes to the anisotropy of the angular distributions of fragments in all of the above mentioned reactions at large values of @xmath55 . according its definition the fast - fission mechanism takes place when complete fusion occurs at large orbital angular momentum but there is not a fission barrier for the being formed compound nucleus .",
