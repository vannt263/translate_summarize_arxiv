    "the aim of this paper is to give a model of a planar hyper - redundant manipulator , that is analogous in morphology to robotic snakes and tentacles , based on a discrete linear dynamical system involving fibonacci sequence .",
    "this approach is motivated by the ubiquitous presence of fibonacci numbers in nature ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and , in particular , in human limbs @xcite .",
    "the robot proposed in the present paper is a planar manipulator with rigid links and with an arbitrarily large number of degrees of freedom , i.e. , it belongs to the class of so - called _ macroscopically - serial hyper - redundant manipulators _  the term was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "the device is controlled by a sequence of couples of discrete actuators on the junctions , ruling both the length of every link and the rotation with respect to the previous link .",
    "hyper - redundant architecture was intensively studied back to the late 60 s , when the first prototype of hyper - redundant robot arm was built @xcite .",
    "the interest of researchers in devices with redundant controls is motivated by their ability to avoid obstacles and to perform new forms of robot locomotion and grasping ",
    "see for instance @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "crucial as it is , effective control of hyper - redundant manipulator is difficult for its redundancy ; see , for example @xcite .",
    "for instance , the number of points of the reachable workspace increases exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom . in this paper",
    ", we employ the self - similarity of fibonacci sequence in order to provide alternative techniques of investigation of the reachable workspace based on combinatorics and on fractal geometry .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to provide a theoretical background suitable for applications to inverse kinematic problems , in a fashion like @xcite , where the analysis of the reachable workspace is used to design an algorithm solving the inverse kinematic problem in linear time with respect the number of actuators .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , the design of a manipulator modeling human arm and with link lengths following the fibonacci sequence , provides a method for the self - collision avoidance problem .",
    "we believe that analogous geometrical properties can be extended to manipulators which are inspired by other biological forms , through the self - similarity induced by fibonacci numbers .",
    "we motivate the choice of discrete controls via their precision with low cost compared to their continuous counterparts .",
    "hyper - redundant manipulators considered here are planar manipulators .",
    "this is only a first step in exploring an approach that , to the best of our knowledge , could add novelty to the existing literature in this field ; therefore , for future work , its extension to the three - dimensional case represents a natural progress of this paper .",
    "we finally anticipate to the reader that the workspaces of planar manipulators of above cited papers ( e.g. @xcite ) are quite different from those depicted here .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that we represent only a subset of the workspace , corresponding to the particular subclass of _ full - rotation configurations _ whose relation with fractal geometry is the most striking .",
    "furthermore , unlike above mentioned works , our robotic device has a telescopic structure modeled by the possibility of ruling not only the angle between but also the length of each link : we believe this additional feature to possibly affect the shape of the workspace .",
    "0.5 cm the theoretical background relies on the theory of iterated function systems  see @xcite for a general introduction on the topic .",
    "the approach proposed here is inspired by the relation between robotics and theory of expansions in non - integer bases , that was first introduced in @xcite and later applied to planar manipulators in @xcite , @xcite,@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "for an overview on the expansions in non - integer bases we refer to the rnyi s seminal paper @xcite and to the papers @xcite and @xcite . for the geometrical aspects of the expansions in complex base , namely the arguments that are more related to problem studied here , we refer to the papers @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and to @xcite .",
    "the techniques developed in the present paper in order to study the full - rotation configuration generalize previous results in @xcite .      a discrete dynamical system models the position of the extremal junction of the manipulator .",
    "the model includes two binary control parameters on every link .",
    "the first control parameter , denoted by @xmath0 , rules the length of the @xmath1-th link @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the @xmath1-th fibonacci number and @xmath4 is a constant scaling ratio , corresponding to the choice of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the other control , @xmath7 , rules the angle between the current link and the previous one , denoted by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 a fixed angle in @xmath10 .",
    "therefore when @xmath11 , the @xmath1-th link is collinear with the previous , and when @xmath12 , it forms a fixed angle @xmath13 with the @xmath14-th link . in section [ smodel ] we show that , under these assumptions , the position of the @xmath1-th junction , @xmath15 is ruled by the relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 . by assuming that the @xmath1-th junction is positioned at time @xmath1 ( namely by reading the index @xmath1 as a discrete time variable ) above equation may be reinterpreted as a discrete control system , whose trajectories model the configurations of the manipulator . this is a stationary problem : indeed , at this stage of the investigation we are interested on the reachable workspace of the manipulator ( namely a static feature of robot ) rather than its kinematics . in this setting , if the number of the links is finite , say it is equal to @xmath18 , then the position of the end effector of the manipulator ( i.e. , the position of its extremal junction ) is represented by @xmath19 .",
    "we call _ reachable workspace _ the set @xmath20 by allowing an infinite number of the links , we also may introduce the definition of _ asymptotic reachable workspace _ @xmath21    the first main results , theorem [ l ] and theorem [ workspace ] , deal with some asymptotic controllability properties of the manipulator .",
    "indeed , the investigation begins with the study of the quantity @xmath22 namely of the _ total length _ of the manipulator for all @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "first of all we notice that the condition @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the golden ratio , ensures the convergence of above series .",
    "theorem [ l ] is a first investigation of the behaviour of the set of possible total lengths @xmath27 as @xmath28 . in particular",
    "we show that if @xmath4 is lower or equal to the value @xmath29 then @xmath30 is an interval .",
    "this estimate is sharp , indeed we shall also prove that when @xmath31 then @xmath30 is a disconnected set .",
    "in other words , theorem [ l ] states that we can arbitrarily set the length of manipulator within the range @xmath32 $ ] ( where we have set @xmath33 ) if and only if the scaling ratio @xmath4 belongs to the range @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ l ] is constructive and an explicit algorithm is given .",
    "theorem [ l ] turns out to be also a useful tool in order to prove sufficient conditions for the _ local asymptotic controllability _ of the control system underlying the model ( see theorem [ workspace ] ) , that is the possibility of place the end effector of the manipulator arbitrarily close to any point belonging to a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin .",
    "more precisely , theorem [ workspace ] states that , under some technical assumptions ( namely we assume the that the maximal rotation angle @xmath9 is of the form @xmath35 for some @xmath36 ) , if @xmath4 belongs to a certain range , then the asymptotic reachable workspace contains a neighborhood of the origin .",
    "the approach in the investigation of @xmath30 and @xmath37 , the latter defined as @xmath38 strongly relies on the particular choice of the lengths of the links , @xmath39 , and in particular , on the fact that , fixing @xmath40 the  backward  sequence @xmath41 satisfies the recursive , contractive relation @xmath42 a suitable generalization of ( [ rec ] ) is interpreted as a discrete control dynamical system , the _ fibonacci control system _ , which is investigated by means of combinatorial arguments .",
    "we then use a generalization of above approach in order to study a suitable subset of @xmath37 , the set of _ full - rotation configurations _",
    "( namely the configurations corresponding to the choice @xmath43 ) .",
    "this approach is motivated by the fact that the full - rotation configurations satisfy a contractive , recursive relation similar to ( [ rec ] ) .",
    "the third main result of the present paper concerns the characterization of @xmath44 and the set of full - rotation configurations in terms of the attractor of a suitable iterated function system ( ifs ) .",
    "this approach gives access to well - established results in fractal geometry in order to further investigate the topological properties of the reachable workspace , and to use known efficient algorithms for the generation of self - similar sets ( e.g. random iteration algorithm ) to have a numerical approximation of the asymptotic reachable set .    in what follows",
    "we show some numerical simulations approximating the asymptotic reachable set associated with full - rotation configurations .",
    "however a deeper exploiting of these potential applications is beyond the purposes of present work .",
    "0.5 cm we finally remark that for all @xmath45 we have the inclusion @xmath46 and , consequently , the hausdorff distance between @xmath47 and @xmath48 satisfies @xmath49 above relation establishes a global error estimate for the approximation of @xmath48 with @xmath47 , hence every above mentioned asymptotic controllability property is inherited by a practical implementable manipulator with a finite number of links @xmath18 by paying an explicitly given , exponential decaying cost in terms of precision .      in section [ smodel ]",
    "we introduce the model and we state the main results on the density of the reachable workspace .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of the dynamical system underlying the model .",
    "section [ ssectioncontrol ] is devoted to the introduction of such fibonacci control system and to its preliminary properties . in section [ sreachability ] and section [ slocal ]",
    "we establish some properties of reachability and local controllability .",
    "finally in section [ sifs ] we establish a relation with the theory of iterated function systems and we point out some parallelisms with classical expansions in non - integer bases .",
    "throughout this section we introduce a model for a snake - like robot . we assume links and junctions to be thin , so to be respectively approximate with their middle axes and barycentres .",
    "we also assume axes and barycentres to be coplanar and , by employing the isometry between @xmath50 , we use the symbols @xmath51 to denote the position of the barycentres of the junctions , therefore the length @xmath52 of the @xmath1-th link is @xmath53    we assume @xmath52 to be ruled by a binary control @xmath0 , and in particular , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is fibonacci sequence , namely @xmath56 and @xmath57 for all @xmath58 .",
    "now , consider the quantity @xmath59 representing the total length of the configuration of the snake - like robot corresponding to the control @xmath60 .    in order to simplify subsequent notations",
    "we shall fix as the base of the manipulator the point @xmath61 , so that the @xmath62-th link is well defined and it may be of length either @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "we shall also use the quantity @xmath64    the most general form of this definition will be used only in section [ slocal ] . at this stage , it is useful to introduce for brevity the notation @xmath65             \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 denotes the golden mean .",

    "if the angle between two consecutive links is constantly equal to @xmath80 , then @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "so far we introduced a control sequence ruling the length of each link .",
    "we now endow the model with another binary control sequence @xmath82 , ruling the angle between two consecutive links . in the model ,",
