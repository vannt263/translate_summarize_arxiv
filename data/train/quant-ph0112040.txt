    "during the last half - century a great attention is being paid to studies of different quantum models of nonlinear optics since they enable to reveal new physical effects and phenomena ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in view of the hamiltonian nonlinearity these models",
    "are mainly analyzed with the help of the numerical calculations @xcite or some linearization procedures @xcite which are not adapted to reveal many peculiarities of model dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , recently a new universal lie - algebraic approach , essentially improving both analytical and numerical solutions of physical problems , has been suggested in @xcite and developed in @xcite for the class of nonlinear quantum models whose hamiltonians @xmath2 have invariance groups @xmath3=0 $ ] .",
    "this approach is based on reformulations of models under study in terms of dual algebraic pairs @xmath4 @xcite where dynamic symmetry algebras @xmath5 are polynomial lie algebras ( pla ) @xmath6 completely describing model dynamics .",
    "specifically , for a wide class of quantum - optical models with @xmath7 both exact and approximate methods were developed in @xcite to obtain adequate ( for physical applications ) forms of the model evolution operators @xmath8 .",
    "exact methods include appropriate lie - algebraic path - integral schemes @xcite and @xmath9-techniques @xcite based on solving difference and difference - differential equations which are fairly complicated for practical calculations because they yield only algorithms rather than closed analytical expressions for solving physical problems .",
    "therefore , for this aim two analytical approximations of @xmath8 were found in @xcite . they enable to examine model dynamics at cluster quasiclassical levels described by `` large '' values of certain characteristic parameters @xcite .",
    "however , up to now systematic examinations of their accuracy and efficiency were absent .    in the present work we cancel in part this lacuna for the simplest and most widely examined ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) example of such models describing process of second - harmonic generation which is given by the hamiltonian @xmath10 , \\label{1.1a}\\ ] ] and by the fock space @xmath11 as the model hilbert space @xmath12",
    "; here @xmath13 are operators of field modes with frequencies @xmath14 , @xmath15 are coupling constants .",
    "classical solutions of the model ( [ 1.1a ] ) were first found ( in terms of elliptical functions ) in @xcite , and later its different quantum features were examined by many investigators ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . specifically , in @xcite some peculiarities , like the collapse - revival phenomena in the janes - cummings model @xcite , were revealed for its model dynamics at the quantum and quasiclassical levels .",
    "the work is organized as follows . after some preliminaries ( section 2 ) we give exact and approximate calculation schemes and routines to determine `` diagonal '' ( spectral ) representations of the model evolution operator by means of the @xmath1-techniques @xcite ( section 3 ) . in section 4",
    "we implement computer experiments to exhibit their efficiency and to investigate the accuracy of appropriate quasiclassical approximations obtained in @xcite . in conclusion",
