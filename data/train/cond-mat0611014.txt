    "the subdiffusion equation is of fractional order with respect to the time variable .",
    "unfortunately , the exact solutions are known only for relatively simple systems , similarly to the normal diffusion case . in more complicated situations such as a system with subdiffusion coefficient depending on concentration ,",
    "inhomogenous fractional subdiffusive system or subdiffusion - reaction system , one needs a numerical procedure to solve of the equation .",
    "usually the subdiffusion equation contains the riemann - liouville fractional time derivative of the order @xmath0 ( @xmath1 denotes here the subdiffusion parameter ) , which is not convenient for physical interpretation of initial conditions . to get the subdiffusion equation with initial conditions which have simple interpretation , one can use the subdiffusion equation with the caputo fractional time derivative of the order @xmath1 .",
    "as far as we know , there is a numerical method to solve the subdiffusion equation with the riemann - liouville fractional time derivative @xcite .",
    "the equation with caputo derivative has been numerically studied only within the time fractional discrete random walk @xcite .",
    "subdiffusion is a process with the time memory .",
    "there arises a practical problem with the memory length , which extends to @xmath2 . to omit the difficulty podlubny @xcite postulated to apply the short memory principle which assumes that the relatively small memory length is sufficient to obtain satisfactorily accuracy of numerical solutions for sufficiently long times",
    "however , as shown here , the method produces significant differences between the numerical and exact solutions . in this paper",
    "we present a numerical procedure of solving the subdiffusion equation with caputo derivative , which is based on the fractional difference approach , and we briefly study the efficiency of the short memory principle for this case .",
    "the transport process is described by the subdiffusion equation @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 denotes the concentration of transported substance , the riemann - liouville fractional time derivative is defined for @xmath6 as @xmath7 where the integer number @xmath8 fulfills the relation @xmath9 .",
    "the presence of time derivatives on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eqrl ] ) is not convenient for numerical calculations . to simplify the numerical procedure we rewrite the eq .",
    "( [ eqrl ] ) in the form @xmath10 where the fractional time derivative on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqc ] ) is now caputo derivative defined by the relation @xmath11 @xmath12 denotes the derivative of natural order @xmath8 .",
    "we note that the laplace transform of the caputo fractional derivative involves values of the function @xmath13 and its derivatives of natural order at @xmath14 while laplace transform of the riemann - liouville fractional derivative includes the fractional derivatives of @xmath13 at @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the physical interpretation of initial conditions in the former case is clear in contrast to the latter one @xcite .",
    "so , it is more convenient to set the initial conditions for the equation with caputo derivative than for the equation with riemann - liouville one .",
    "to numerically solve the normal diffusion equation one usually substitutes the time derivative by the backward difference @xmath15 . in the presented procedure",
    "we proceed in a similar way . for that purpose",
    "we use the grnwald - letnikow fractional derivative , which is defined as a limit of a fractional - order backward difference @xcite @xmath16}(-1)^{r } \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\alpha\\\\ r \\end{array } \\right)f(t - r\\delta t),\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath17 $ ] means the integer part of @xmath18 and @xmath19}{1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot r}.\\ ] ]    when the function @xmath20 of positive argument has continuous derivatives of the integer order @xmath21 , the riemann - liouville definition  ( [ rl ] ) is equivalent to the grnwald - letnikow one @xcite .",
    "so , we can take @xmath22 the relation between riemann - liouville and caputo derivatives is more complicated and reads as @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 from eqs .",
    "( [ gl])-([phi ] ) we can express the caputo fractional derivative in terms of the fractional - order backward difference @xcite @xmath25}(-1)^{r}\\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\alpha\\\\ r \\end{array } \\right)f(t - r\\delta t)-\\frac{1}{t^{\\alpha}\\gamma(1-\\alpha)}f(0).\\ ] ]      the standard way to approximate of the fractional derivative , which is useful for numerical calculations , is to omit the limit in eq .",
    "( [ glc ] ) and to change the infinite series occurring in ( [ glc ] ) to the finite one @xmath26 where arbitrary chosen parameter @xmath27 is called the memory length .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ glca ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eqc ] ) and using the following approximation of the second order derivative @xmath28 after simple calculation we obtain @xmath29}{1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot r } c(x , t - r\\delta t)\\\\+\\frac{1}{t^{\\alpha}\\gamma(1-\\alpha)}c(x,0 ) + d_{\\alpha}\\frac{(\\delta t)^{\\alpha}}{(\\delta x)^{2}}[c(x+\\delta x , t-\\delta t)\\\\ \\nonumber -2c(x , t-\\delta t)+c(x-\\delta x , t-\\delta t)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there arise a problem with the choice of initial conditions . we choose the initial conditions only for @xmath14 assuming that the concentration given for earlier moments @xmath30 does not influence the process for @xmath31 .",
    "this assumption is in agreement with the procedure of solving the equations with caputo fractional derivative where the initial conditions are determined only at @xmath14 for the derivatives of natural order @xmath32 , @xmath33 $ ] ( here @xmath34 ) . in our considerations we have @xmath4 , hence it is enough to set @xmath35 as the initial condition .",
    "starting with the initial condition @xmath35 we will find the time iterations @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "when the number of time steps @xmath38 is less then the memory length @xmath27 then we put @xmath39 in the series occurring in eq .",
    "( [ alg ] ) , otherwise the memory length is equal to @xmath27 .",
    "to test the numerical procedure we are going to compare the numerical solutions of the subdiffusion equation with the exact analytical ones .",
    "for that purpose we choose the homogenous system with the initial concentration @xmath40 the solution of the subdiffusion equation  ( [ eqc ] ) with the initial condition  ( [ icon ] ) is following @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the fox function , which can be expressed by the series @xcite @xmath43    [ t100 ]   calculated for @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and with different memory length @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ; continuous line represents the exact analytical solution.,title=\"fig:\",height=377 ]    [ bt50 ] , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and with memory length @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath51 , and @xmath58.,title=\"fig:\",height=377 ]    [ ct50 ] , @xmath59 , time @xmath53 and with memory length @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath51 , and @xmath58.,title=\"fig:\",height=377 ]    the results of numerical calculations and the analytical solutions are shown in the plots . in figures 1 - 3 we present the numerical solutions of the subdiffusion equation for different values of @xmath60 , @xmath1 , and @xmath61 . in each case",
    "we present the plot of analytical solution ( continuous line ) and numerical solutions calculated for different memory length @xmath27 ( symbols without line ) . the time and the memory length",
    "are given as the number of all time steps @xmath62 , which corresponds to the real time @xmath60 by the relation @xmath63 .",
    "in all cases we take @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( all quantities are given in arbitrary units ) ; to calculate the analytical solutions ( [ sol ] ) we took 100 first terms in the series occurring in ( [ h ] ) .",
    "we can see that the memory length determines the accuracy of numerical solutions .",
    "we have presented the procedure to numerically solve the subdiffusion equation with caputo fractional time derivative . the choice of the equation in such a form is not accidental since the interpretation of the initial condition in this case is simpler than in the equation with riemann - liouville derivative . in all considered cases the numerical solutions",
    "coincide with the analytical ones . in the studies @xcite the short memory principle was postulated . according to this principle ,",
    "the fractional derivative is approximated by the fractional derivative with moving lower limit @xmath67 , where @xmath27 is the memory length. the examples presented in @xcite suggest that the @xmath68 time steps gives a good approximation for times of the order of @xmath69 time steps .",
    "however , the results presented here show that this memory length is not sufficient for the subdiffusion case .",
    "our analysis demonstrate that the memory length should be longer than about 80 per cent of the value of time variable .",
