    "random walks on graphs have found many applications in computer science , including randomised algorithms for 2-satisfiability , graph connectivity and probability amplification ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , schning  @xcite discovered a random walk based algorithm similar to that of  @xcite that gives an elegant ( and the most efficient known ) solution to 3-satisfiability .",
    "in general , markov chain simulation has emerged as a powerful algorithmic tool and has had a profound impact on random sampling and approximate counting  @xcite .",
    "notable among its numerous applications are estimating the volume of convex bodies  @xcite and approximating the permanent  @xcite .",
    "a few months ago , jerrum , sinclair and vigoda  @xcite used this approach to solve the long standing open problem of approximating the permanent in the general case .    in the spirit of developing similar techniques for quantum algorithms , we consider _",
    "quantum _ walk on graphs . to date , few general techniques are known for developing and analysing quantum algorithms : _ fourier sampling _ , which is typified by the seminal work of simon  @xcite and shor  @xcite , and _ amplitude amplification _ , which originated in the seminal work of grover  @xcite .",
    "barring applications of these techniques , the search for new quantum algorithms has primarily been _ ad hoc_. we believe that studying quantum walk on graphs is a step towards providing a systematic way of speeding up classical algorithms based on random walk .",
    "we begin by considering the quantum walk in one dimension . recall that a classical particle doing a random walk on the integer lattice chooses , at every time step , a random direction ( `` left '' or `` right '' ) to move in , and moves to the site adjacent to it in that direction . in direct analogy , one may navely try to define quantum walk on the line as follows : at every time step , the particle moves , _ in superposition _",
    ", both left _ and _ right with equal amplitudes ( perhaps with a relative phase difference ) .",
    "however , such a walk is physically impossible , since the global process is non - unitary .",
    "it is also easy to verify that the only possible homogeneous ( i.e. , translationally invariant ) unitary processes on the line involving transitions between adjacent lattice sites are the left and right shift operators ( up to an overall phase )  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the rather uninteresting motion in a single direction . as explained below ( and",
    "also shown by  @xcite ) , it is still possible to construct a unitary walk if the particle has an extra degree of freedom that assists in its motion .    consider a quantum particle that moves freely on the integer points on the line , and has an additional degree of freedom , its _ chirality _ , which takes values `` left '' and `` right ''",
    ". a walk on the line by such a particle may be described as follows . at every time step ,",
    "its chirality undergoes a rotation ( a unitary transformation in general ) and then the particle moves according to its final chirality state .",
    "figure  [ fig - hwalk ] depicts this two - stage move in a quantum walk where the chirality undergoes a hadamard transformation .",
    "we call this particular walk the `` hadamard walk '' .",
    "= 2.0 in    in this paper , we analyse in detail the dynamics of the hadamard walk on the line .",
    "we derive the asymptotic form of the probability induced on the line by observing the position of a particle doing the walk and show that after  @xmath0 time steps , the distribution is almost uniformly distributed over the interval  @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "this implies that the analogously defined walk on the or the circle _ mixes _ in _ linear _ time .",
    "this is in immediate contrast with the classical random walk , which mixes in _ quadratic _ time.-_mixing time _ of a walk we mean the _ first _ time ( independent of the initial state ) at which the distribution induced by the walk is  @xmath2-close to uniform in total variation distance .",
    "the parameter  @xmath2 is understood to be a constant less than  @xmath3 if it is not explicitly specified . ]",
    "next , we turn to general quantum walk on the line . such a walk may involve arbitrary transitions between adjacent lattice points on the line ( subject to the global unitarity constraint ) .",
    "it turns out that any homogeneous , local unitary process on the line governing the motion of a particle may be recast as a unitary transformation of the chirality followed by a left / right shift  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if we are interested in _ unbiased _ walk has a formal definition of this notion .",
    "essentially , it means that the walk makes no distinction between the two halves of the line given by its initial position .",
    "it is not hard to see that in any other kind of ( _ biased _ ) unitary walk , the particle moves in a single direction with probability  @xmath3 at every time step . ] , we may assume that the particle moves one step to the left if it ends up with chirality `` left '' , and one step to the right if it ends up with chirality `` right '' .",
    "thus , there is no loss in generality in studying only such walk .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that if we are interested only in the probability distribution induced on the line by such a walk , we may restrict ourselves to the study of a family of walks specified by a _ single _",
    "parameter  @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "we show that _ every _ walk in this family , except that for  @xmath5 , shares the gross features of the hadamard walk . in particular ,",
    "all except the two singular walks mix in linear time .",
    "one method for analysing quantum processes such as the walk we study is the _ path integral _ approach .",
    "this method involves explicitly computing the amplitude of being in a certain state as the sum , over all possible paths leading to that state , of the amplitude of taking that path .",
    "the problem of evaluating , or even approximating , path integrals to determine the time development of a wave function is well known to be notoriously hard .",
    "we circumvent this barrier by taking the _ schdinger approach _ , which takes advantage of the time and space homogeneity of the quantum walk .",
    "the crucial observation is that because of its translational invariance , the walk has a simple description in fourier space .",
    "the fourier transform of the wave function is thus easily analysed , and transformed back to the spatial domain .",
    "it is noteworthy that this technique is standard in the analysis of classical random walk  @xcite .",
    "a key advantage of the schdinger approach is that the resulting description of the wave function , in terms of integrals of the fourier type , is amenable to analysis in standard ways .",
    "there is a well - developed theory of the asymptotic expansion of integrals  @xcite which allows us to determine the leading behaviour of the wave function in the large time limit .",
    "( this is exactly the case of interest in the design of asymptotically efficient algorithms . )",
    "we are thus able to derive the asymptotic functional form of the corresponding probability distribution .",
    "we also use the theory of asymptotic expansion of integrals in a non - standard way to deduce some properties of the probability distribution induced by the walk . for example , we use this method to approximate the probability masses of each point on the line by an integral of the fourier type .",
    "this allows us to calculate the net probability of an interval , and the different moments of the distribution very precisely .",
    "finally , we note that the asymptotic quantities we calculate match very well with simulation results even for small times , indicating that our results may apply to small quantum systems as well .",
    "quantum dynamics similar to ours has previously been studied by meyer  @xcite in the context of quantum cellular automata .",
    "he singles out the one parameter family of unitary processes mentioned above and derives a closed form solution for the corresponding wave functions .",
    "the solution is obtained by following the path integral approach and allows him to express it in terms of the gauss hypergeometric function .",
    "his motivation in studying such dynamics is however very different from ours , and he does not quantitatively analyse the wave functions further .    in work more closely related to ours in its motivation , nayak ,",
    "schulman and vazirani  @xcite have studied random sampling on a quantum computer .",
    "they gave an efficient method for generating superpositions for which the corresponding probability distributions satisfy certain well - behavedness properties .",
    "using this for a distribution related by a fourier transform , they gave an efficient quantum algorithm for sampling from the gibbs distribution for the ising model .",
    "( subsequently , randall and wilson  @xcite discovered a _ classical _ polynomial time algorithm for this task via a different route . )",
    "watrous  @xcite has considered unitary processes based on quantum walk on regular graphs in the context of undirected graph connectivity and logarithmic - space computation .",
    "he shows that it is possible to construct , in logarithmic space with limited measurement , and with high probability , a good approximation to the superposition over all vertices connected to a specified vertex in the graph , using a local unitary transform as a subroutine .",
    "we have recently learnt that aharonov , ambainis , kempe and vazirani  @xcite have independently studied quantum walks on graphs and their mixing behaviour .",
    "they observe that the probability distribution induced by a unitary process on a finite dimensional hilbert space is essentially periodic and hence does not converge to a stationary distribution .",
    "they argue that the notion of mixing in this case is therefore more appropriately captured by the closeness to the uniform distribution , of the _ average _ of the probability distribution over all time steps .",
    "they show that the quantum walk on the  @xmath6-circle mixes in time  @xmath7 in this sense .",
    "they also show a lower bound of  @xmath8 for this mixing time for general graphs , where  @xmath9 is the maximum degree of a vertex in the graph and  @xmath10 is the _",
    "conductance_.    we have also learnt that ambainis and watrous  @xcite have analysed the hadamard walk on the unbounded line , and show that it has linear mixing characteristics .",
    "they follow the approach of meyer , and further analyse the path integrals so obtained to arrive at the result .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we formally define and analyse quantum walk on the line in section  [ sec - walk ] .",
    "some background on fourier transforms required for this is summarised in appendix  [ sec - tech ] .",
    "details of some calculations required for the section are provided in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "we then consider the behaviour of the walk after large times and derive its asymptotic properties in section  [ sec - asympt ] .",
    "this section is heavily based on the method of stationary phase described in appendix  [ sec - tech ] .",
    "the approximations made in the section are justified in appendix  [ app2 ] . for lack of space ,",
    "we are not able to provide the full details of the analysis of the general quantum walk on the line .",
    "the technique involved in the analysis is however the same as that for the hadamard walk .",
    "appendix  [ sec - general ] summarises the main conclusions about the general case .",
    "a particle doing a ( classical ) symmetric random walk on the line may be described as follows .",
    "it starts , say , at the origin , and at every time step , tosses a fair coin . each of the two possible outcomes of the toss is associated with a distinct direction , `` left '' or `` right '' .",
    "the particle moves one step in the direction resulting from the toss .    a quantum generalisation of this process involves a quantum particle on the line , but with an additional degree of freedom which we call the `` chirality '' .",
    "the chirality takes values `` left '' and `` right '' , and directs the motion of the particle . at any given time the particle may be in a superposition of `` left '' and `` right '' chirality states and is therefore described by a two - component wave function .",
    "the dynamics of the walk that we consider is given by the following rules .",
    "at each time step , the chirality undergoes a rotation ( a unitary transformation , in general ) , and the particle moves according to its final chirality state .",
    "therefore , if the particle ends up with chirality `` left '' , it moves one step to the left , and if it ends up with chirality `` right '' , it moves one step to the right .    for concreteness , we begin by focusing on a quantum walk in which the unitary transformation acting on the chirality state at each time step , is chosen to be the hadamard transformation ( the fourier transform over  @xmath11 ) : @xmath12 here l and r refer to the  right and `` left '' chirality states .",
    "the resulting quantum walk , which we will refer to as the `` hadamard walk '' is depicted in figure  [ fig - hwalk ] .    to study the properties of the walk defined above",
    ", we consider the wave function describing the position of the particle and analyse how it evolves with time .",
    "let  @xmath13 be the two component vector of amplitudes of the particle being at point  @xmath6 at time  @xmath0 , with the chirality being left ( upper component ) or right ( lower component ) .",
    "the dynamics for  @xmath14 is then given by the following transformation ( cf.figure  [ fig - hwalk ] ) : @xmath15                    \\psi(n-1,t )   \\;\\;+\\;\\ ;                    \\left [   \\begin{array}{cc }                            { 1\\over{\\sqrt{2 } } } & { 1\\over{\\sqrt{2 } } } \\\\                            0 & 0                             \\end{array }                    \\right ]                    \\psi(n+1,t ) \\\\              & = & m_{+ }   \\psi(n-1,t ) + m_{- } \\psi(n+1,t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for matrices  @xmath16 defined appropriately .",
    "note that this transformation is _ unitary _ on the basis states given by  @xmath17 , since it is the composition of a unitary operation and a reversible move to the left or the right .",
    "moreover , since the particle starts at the origin with chirality state `` left '' ( say ) , we have the initial conditions , @xmath18 , and  @xmath19 if  @xmath20 .    with the above formulation",
    ", the analysis of the hadamard walk reduces to solving a two dimensional linear recurrence ( or a _ difference equation _ ) .",
    "we show how this recurrence may be analysed in the next section .      as mentioned in section  [ sec - intro ] , quantum walk of the kind defined above has , due to translational invariance , a very simple description in the fourier domain .",
    "we therefore cast the problem of time evolution in this basis , where it can be easily solved , and at the end revert back to the real space description by inverting the fourier transformation .",
    "the details are described below .",
    "the spatial fourier transform  @xmath21 ( for  @xmath22 $ ] ) of the wave function  @xmath23 over  @xmath24 is given by ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ sec - tech ] ) @xmath25 in particular , we have  @xmath26 for all  @xmath27 , for a particle starting at the origin with initially `` left '' chirality .    from the dynamics of  @xmath14 , we may deduce the following about  @xmath28 : @xmath29 thus , we have , @xmath30 where @xmath31.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that  @xmath32 , where  @xmath33 is the diagonal matrix with entries  @xmath34 and  @xmath35 is the transpose of the unitary matrix  @xmath36 that acts on the chirality state of the particle .",
    "hence  @xmath37 is a unitary matrix .",
    "[ this general presentation anticipates the walk with general u. ]    the recurrence in fourier space thus takes the simple form  @xmath38 , leading to  @xmath39 .",
    "we may calculate  @xmath40 ( and thus  @xmath21 ) by diagonalising the matrix  @xmath37 , which is readily done since it is a  @xmath41 unitary matrix .",
    "if  @xmath37 has eigenvectors ( @xmath42,@xmath43 ) and corresponding eigenvalues ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) , we can write : @xmath46 and then immediately we obtain the time evolution matrix as : @xmath47 the eigenvalues of  @xmath37 are  @xmath48 and  @xmath49 , where  @xmath50 is defined as the angle in  @xmath51 $ ] such that  @xmath52 . the corresponding eigenvectors are displayed in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "for definiteness , here we consider the time evolution of a particle that begins at the origin in the `` left '' chirality state . in the fourier basis this initial state",
    "is represented by  @xmath53 for all  @xmath27 .",
    "the wave function at time  @xmath0 is then given by : @xmath54    we now invert the fourier transformation , to return to the basis in real space ( cf .  appendix  [ sec - tech ] ) .",
    "the wave functions in real space can be written in the form :    @xmath55    notice that the amplitudes vanish for even  @xmath6 ( respectively , odd  @xmath6 ) at odd  @xmath0 ( even  @xmath0 ) , as we would expect from the definition of the walk .",
    "thus , we have obtained a closed form solution for the time evolved wave function of the hadamard walk . in view of possible applications to developing quantum algorithms ,",
    "we are naturally led to considering the behaviour of the wave functions at large times ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "happily , the problem is considerably simplified in this asymptotic limit which allows us to accurately derive several useful results . in the next section ,",
    "we give details of this asymptotic analysis .",
    "in the previous section , we obtained an exact solution for the time evolution of the hadamard walk . in",
    "what follows , we will use extensively the method of stationary phase ( see appendix  [ sec - tech ] ) to extract the asymptotic properties of the resulting wave function .",
    "= 3.2 in    the asymptotic analysis for  @xmath57 and  @xmath58 is essentially the same .",
    "they can both be written as a sum of integrals of the type  @xmath59 described in appendix  [ app1 ] . here , @xmath60 should be understood as  @xmath61 .",
    "appendix  [ app1 ] gives the details of the analysis for this generic integral ; we summarise the conclusions below .",
    "the asymptotics for the wave function are simple to describe .",
    "the wave function is essentially uniformly spread over the interval between  @xmath62 ( and so there its gross behaviour is like  @xmath63 , and it dies out very fast ( faster than any inverse polynomial in  @xmath0 ) outside the interval . at the `` frontiers '' at  @xmath64 ,",
    "however , there are two peaks of width  @xmath65 where the wave function goes as  @xmath66 .",
    "the net probability below these two peaks and beyond  @xmath62 thus goes as  @xmath66 , and does not affect the properties of the wave function we are interested in .",
    "we will therefore restrict our attention to the interval  @xmath67 .",
    "the exact expressions for  @xmath68 for such  @xmath60 are displayed in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "we can calculate the probability of observing the particle doing the quantum walk at any given point  @xmath69 from the wave function derived above .",
    "below we give the asymptotic distribution for points  @xmath70 between  @xmath71 and  @xmath72 , for an arbitrarily small constant  @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where  @xmath75 , and  @xmath76 is the root of  @xmath77 in  @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "the ( approximate ) probability distribution  @xmath79 compares very well with simulation results even for small  @xmath0 , as is evident from figure  [ fig - prob ] .",
    "the bias to the left in the probability distribution plotted in the figure is an artifact of the choice of initial chirality state ( it was chosen to be `` left '' ) .",
    "if the particle begins in the chirality state  @xmath80 , the distribution at any time turns out to be symmetric ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec - general ] , and figure  [ fig - symmprob ] in the appendix ) .",
    "indeed , the hadamard walk is an _ unbiased _ walk .",
    "we show in appendix  [ app2 ] that the net probability of the points  @xmath6 with  @xmath70 between  @xmath71 and  @xmath72 , where  @xmath81 is an arbitrarily small constant , is  @xmath82 , so the rest of the points do not contribute to any global properties of the distribution",
    ". henceforth , we restrict ourselves to this interval .    for the purposes of calculating the moments of the distribution , it will be convenient to decompose  @xmath79 as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a slowly varying ( non - oscillating ) function in  @xmath60 , and  @xmath85 is the remaining ( quickly oscillating ) component . by the analysis shown in appendix  [ app2 ]",
    ", we can show that any contribution to a moment from the `` fast '' component  @xmath85 is of lower order in  @xmath0 than the contribution from  @xmath86 . in figure  [ fig - pslow ]",
    ", we compare  @xmath86 with  @xmath79 .",
    "= 3.2 in    the calculation of moments is further simplified by the following observation .",
    "let  @xmath87 .",
    "then  @xmath88 is a probability density function over the interval between  @xmath62 .",
    "it is clearly non - negative , and we show below that it integrates to  @xmath3 .",
    "this observation allows us to approximate the sums in the moment calculations by a _",
    "riemann integral _ , and the error so introduced is again a lower order term ( cf .  appendix  [ app2 ] ) .    to see that  @xmath89 integrates to  @xmath3 , note that  @xmath90 , so @xmath91",
    "now , @xmath92 since the function  @xmath93 is anti - symmetric around the point  @xmath94 .",
    "the different moments for the density function  @xmath88 are now readily calculated by standard methods from complex residue theory .",
    "these are listed in figure  [ fig - moments ] for comparison with simulation results .",
    "this gives us the leading term for the moments for the distribution  @xmath79 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      it is quite evident from figure  [ fig - prob ] that the probability distribution  @xmath79 is almost uniform over the interval between  @xmath95 .",
    "we argue this formally below .",
    "recall that the  @xmath2-mixing time ( @xmath96 ) of a random process is defined as the first time  @xmath0 such that the distribution at time  @xmath0 is at total variation distance ( which is half the  @xmath97 distance ) at most  @xmath2 from the uniform distribution .",
    "we claim that there is a constant  @xmath98 such that at time  @xmath0 , @xmath79 is  @xmath2-close to the uniform distribution on the integer points between  @xmath99 .",
    "we emphasise that for classical symmetric random walk , the corresponding mixing time is _ quadratic _ in  @xmath0 .    in order to show that the hadamard walk is `` mixed '' at time  @xmath0 ( in the sense described above ) , it suffices to show that a constant fraction  @xmath100 of the points in the said interval have probability between  @xmath101 and  @xmath102 for a constant  @xmath103 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that this implies that the  @xmath97 distance from uniform over  @xmath104 $ ] is at most  @xmath105 , so that  @xmath106 is a constant .    as in the previous section ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the interval where  @xmath107 $ ] ( with  @xmath81 chosen to be a suitable constant ) such that  @xmath108 is at most  @xmath109 within the interval . recall that the probability mass within this interval is  @xmath110 , which is a constant greater than  @xmath111 ( see appendix  [ app2 ] for a proof of this ) .",
    "clearly , this can not hold unless at least a constant fraction  @xmath112 of the points within this interval have probability at least some constant  @xmath113 over  @xmath114 .",
    "this completes the proof of the mixing nature of the hadamard walk .",
    "in this paper , we defined and studied the behaviour of quantum walks on the line , and showed a linear time mixing behaviour for these walks .",
    "this has an immediate bearing on the similar walks defined on the circle .",
    "it is easy to derive the wave function for the walk on the circle , since it is exactly the wave function for the unbounded line wrapped around the circle .",
    "the linear time mixing for the circle is immediate .",
    "it is also possible to derive the wave function for an appropriately modified walk on the _ finite _ line using the solution to the unbounded walk .",
    "we expect that this walk be mixing in linear time as well , but leave the details to  @xcite .",
    "( note that because of boundary effects , the mixing of the walk on a finite line does not follow directly from our results if the walk begins close to the edges . )",
    "aharonov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have defined quantum walks on general graphs in the same manner .",
    "it would be interesting to characterise the class of graphs on which quantum walks mix faster than classical ones .",
    "a promising candidate is the class of cayley graphs , which seem to be amenable to analysis along the same lines as ours because of their rich group - theoretic structure",
    ". it would also be interesting to study how much speed - up is possible in general , and for different classes of graphs .",
    "the lower bound result of  @xcite is a step in this direction .",
    "our work leads to a plethora of questions regarding the properties of quantum walks .",
    "it is yet unclear which of these are interesting from an algorithmic point of view .",
    "any speed - up of a known classical algorithm based on random walk ( such as those mentioned in section  [ sec - intro ] ) seems to involve the analysis of quantum walk on graphs much more complex than the line .",
    "however , we believe such analysis is still tractable .",
    "finally , we ask if it is possible to design quantum algorithms to generate certain desirable superpositions efficiently  those corresponding to distributions that are classically hard to sample from ( much in the spirit of  @xcite ) .",
    "it is conceivable that such algorithms follow an approach that is completely different from the standard markov chain monte carlo method .",

    "we will be concerned with functions  @xmath120 with finite support , i.e. , functions which are zero except at finitely many points  @xmath6 .",
    "the fourier transforms are extremely well behaved for this class of functions . for more details on the properties of these transforms ,",
    "see , for example ,  @xcite .      studying the large time behaviour of quantum walks naturally leads us to consider the behaviour of integrals of the form @xmath121 as  @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "there is a well - developed theory of the asymptotic expansion of integrals which allows us to determine , very precisely , the leading terms in the expansion of the integral in terms of simple functions of  @xmath0 ( such as inverse powers of  @xmath0 ) .",
    "below , we explain an important technique known as the method of stationary phase  @xcite from this theory .    intuitively , the method may be understood as follows .",
    "the exponential in the integral is a rapidly oscillating function if  @xmath0 is large ( and if  @xmath122 is not constant in any subinterval ) .",
    "if  @xmath123 is a smooth function of  @xmath27 , then the contributions from adjacent subintervals nearly cancel each other out , and the major contribution to the value of the integral comes from the region where the oscillations are least rapid . the regions of slow oscillation occur precisely at the _ stationary points _ of the function  @xmath122 , i.e , points  @xmath124 where  @xmath125 .",
    "( if no such point exists , we can get the asymptotic expansion for  @xmath126 in terms of inverse powers of  @xmath0 by repeated integration by parts , and the integral decays faster than  @xmath127 . )",
    "so the significant terms in the expansion of the integral come from a small interval around the stationary points .",
    "the `` flatness '' of  @xmath122 at a stationary point then determines the contribution of its neighbourhood to the integral .",

    "the basic observation is that each term in the moment sum such as  @xmath201 is essentially the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of an integral of the type in equation  ( [ eqn - integral ] ) discussed appendix  [ sec - tech ] : @xmath202 where @xmath203 and  @xmath2 is a suitable constant .",
    "the expression for  @xmath120 above is derived using the identity  @xmath204 and comparing the term in the moment sum with the asymptotic form of the integral in equation  ( [ eqn - asympt ] ) in appendix  [ sec - tech ] .",
    "the error introduced by this integral representation is  @xmath205 .",
    "we may now bound the contribution to the moment sum due to  @xmath206 as @xmath207 where  @xmath208 .",
    "we may now use the method of stationary phase again to derive the asymptotic form of the integral . as we expect from the analysis we did in appendix  [ app1 ] ,",
    "the integral goes as  @xmath209 , and thus the entire expression goes as  @xmath187 .",
    "so far we have been describing the details of the hadamard walk on the line . here , we consider the properties of the general quantum walk on the line . as mentioned in section  [ sec - intro ]",
    ", it suffices to consider a particle that carries a `` left '' or `` right '' chirality , and at each time step undergoes a unitary transformation of its chirality state and then moves accordingly , one step to the right if it ends in `` right '' chirality state , and one step to the left if it ends in the `` left '' chirality state .",
    "the most general such unitary transformation contains four parameters .",
    "however , it can be shown  @xcite that if we focus on the probability distribution that results from these walks , then there is a _ single _",
    "parameter that labels a family of walks , and every element of the family gives rise to identical probability distributions  @xmath210 for the same initial conditions .",
    "the walks given by this parameter are also singled out for study in  @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider a representative element from each family , which we write as @xmath211 the operator  @xmath212 evolves the state by one time step , i.e. , @xmath213 , the operator  @xmath214 implements the left / right shift ( @xmath215 while @xmath216 ) , and  @xmath217 is the unitary transformation acting on the chirality state .",
    "the hadamard walk belongs to the family of walks parametrised by @xmath218 . to show this we write the hadamard transform as @xmath219 thus , by a suitable redefinition of phase of the chirality states at time @xmath220 , the additional rotation that multiplies  @xmath221 can be absorbed .",
    "clearly , the probability distributions for finding a particle at a point are unaffected by this redefinition of phase . therefore , the hadamard walk is equivalent to the walk with  @xmath222 .",
    "the behaviour of the walk with  @xmath223 and  @xmath224 are easily analysed .",
    "when  @xmath223 , the unitary transformation rotating the chirality states is the identity , and hence a particle starting with `` left '' ( `` right '' ) chirality , after @xmath0 time steps , moves @xmath0 units to the left ( right ) .",
    "this walk is clearly not mixing , since the probability is concentrated at one or two points at any given instant , and resembles more the biased classical walk ( though we wish to emphasise here that all the quantum walks we consider are _ unbiased _ , a point which we return to below ) .",
    "now , when @xmath224 , the unitary transformation flips the chirality at each time step . hence a particle zig zags between the origin and a neighbouring point , and thus has a non - zero probability on a maximum of three points .",
    "this walk too is clearly not mixing .",
    "for intermediate values of @xmath225 the behaviour is more involved , as our analysis of the hadamard walk indicates .",
    "in fact , the qualitative behaviour of the hadamard walk is generic to all  @xmath225 excluding the singular values  @xmath226 that we discussed above .",
    "all of these walks are mixing , and mix in linear time .",
    "we can calculate very easily some properties of the general walk , following the analysis for the hadamard walk .",
    "we first note that the eigenvalues of  @xmath227 for the general walk given by @xmath225 are @xmath228 where  @xmath229 $ ] .",
    "it is possible to deduce the relevant component  @xmath86 of the asymptotic probability distribution  @xmath79 from the eigenvalues in equation  ( [ eqn - eigen ] ) , as is evident from the case of the hadamard walk .",
    "the distribution  @xmath86 beginning with symmetric initial conditions is : @xmath230 and has support on the interval  @xmath231 . here",
    "@xmath76 is given by the usual stationary point condition : @xmath232 and the derivatives of  @xmath233 with respect to  @xmath27 are @xmath234.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the stationary points are  @xmath235 , where  @xmath236 $ ] and @xmath237 the second derivative of the phase at the stationary points is  @xmath238 where @xmath239    we can readily verify that the probability sums to one , i.e. , @xmath240 where we have used the fact that @xmath241 .",
    "thus , as in the case of the hadamard walk , almost all the probability is confined to the interval between  @xmath242 and is close to uniform over it . however , the `` height '' of the distribution is proportional to  @xmath243 , and the distance from uniform increases as  @xmath244 . on the other hand , as  @xmath245 , the `` width '' of",
    "the distribution ( which is proportional to  @xmath246 ) goes to zero , again increasing the distance from uniform .",
    "the distribution  @xmath86 can , as before , be used to calculate moments . for example , the mean position of the particle  @xmath247 is given by @xmath248 which matches the expected value at the points @xmath249 .",
    "finally we comment on the unbiased nature of the quantum walks defined in this manner .",
    "an unbiased walk ( starting at the origin ) does not distinguish between the left and right halves of the line , i.e. , it is reflection symmetric . in order to capture this into a condition on unbiased walks ,",
    "it is necessary to also account for the initial chirality state of the particle which can lead to a biased probability distribution , although the rules governing the walk are intrinsically reflection symmetric .",
    "therefore , although such a symmetric walk can produce a biased probability distribution with some particular initial condition , there exists another initial condition for which the bias is exactly reversed . in more formal terms , if we describe the quantum walk by the matrices @xmath37 in equation  ( [ eqn - mk ] ) in section  [ sec - walk ] , then we need to find a unitary matrix @xmath250 such that : @xmath251 the unitary matrix @xmath250 performs a rotation on the chirality state that reverses any bias arising from the choice of initial condition .",
    "if no such matrix exists , then the walk intrinsically distinguishes left from right and is hence not an unbiased walk . in fact , the minus sign appears for the hadamard walk , where @xmath252 . ] .",
    "an immediate consequence is that if we start with an initial chirality state that is an eigenvector of @xmath250 , then a symmetric probability distribution is generated . for the family of",
    "walks just considered , the unitary matrix @xmath252 will suffice since it only interchanges @xmath253 and @xmath254 and does nothing else .",
    "therefore , starting in the initial chirality state @xmath255 generates a symmetric distribution , as shown for the hadamard walk in figure  [ fig - symmprob ] ."
