    "flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes are not only powerful tests of the standard model ( sm ) but also provide very stringent tests for any physics beyond it .",
    "the smallness of fcnc processes in the sm is attributed to the fact that these processes are generated at loop level and are further suppressed by the ckm factors . due to their smallness within the sm these processes",
    "can also be very sensitive to any new physics beyond the sm . amongst the many fcnc decays involving @xmath7 and @xmath2-mesons the decays of the form",
    "@xmath8 have been the focus of much investigation at the @xmath7 factories belle and babar .    of particular interest , in the sm ,",
    "is the decay @xmath9 , as it has the theoretical advantage of uncertainties much smaller than those of other decays , due to the absence of a photonic penguin contribution and hadronic long distance effects .",
    "however , in spite these theoretical advantages , it might be very difficult to measure the inclusive mode @xmath10 , as it requires a construction of all the @xmath11 s .",
    "therefore the rare @xmath12 decays play a special role , both from experimental and theoretical points of view .",
    "also the branching fractions of the @xmath7-meson decays are quite large , with theoretical estimates of @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these processes , based on @xmath15 , are very sensitive to non - standard @xmath16 models and have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .    as such , any new physics model which can provide a relatively light new source of _ missing energy _ can potentially enhance the observed rates of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , where many models have been proposed which provide such low mass candidates ( which can contribute to @xmath19 ) .",
    "note that in reference @xcite the phenomenology of such low mass scalars was explored .",
    "such studies have also been done in the context of large extra dimension models @xcite and leptophobic @xmath20 models @xcite .",
    "one such model , which has excited much interest recently , is that of unparticles , as proposed by h. georgi @xcite . in this model",
    "we assume that at a very high energy our theory contains both the fields of the sm and the fields of a theory with a nontrivial ir fixed point , which he called the banks - zaks ( bz ) fields @xcite . in his model these two sets interacted through the exchange of particles with a large mass scale @xmath21 , where below this scale there were nonrenormablizable couplings between the sm fields and the bz fields suppressed by powers of @xmath21 .",
    "the renormalizable couplings of the bz fields then produced dimensional transmutation , and the scale - invariant unparticle fields emerged below an energy scale @xmath22 .    in the effective theory below @xmath22",
    "the bz operators matched onto the unparticle operators , and the nonrenormaliable interactions matched onto a new set of interactions between the sm and unparticle fields .",
    "the end result was a collection of unparticle stuff with scale dimension @xmath23 , which looked like a non - integral number @xmath23 of invisible massless particles , whose production might be detectable in missing energy and momentum distributions @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a lot of interest in unparticle physics @xcite , where the signatures of _ unparticles _ have been discussed at colliders @xcite , in lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes @xcite , cosmology and astrophysics @xcite , and low energy processes @xcite .    in the present work we study the @xmath24 decay in unparticle theory , where this work is organized as follows : in section 2 we calculate the various contributions from both the sm and unparticle theory to the above - mentioned decays .",
    "section 3 contains our numerical analysis and conclusions .",
    "in the sm the decay mode @xmath25 is described by the decay @xmath26 . as was noted earlier",
    ", unparticles can also contribute to these decays .",
    "hence a comparison of the signatures of the two decay modes @xmath26 and @xmath27 is required .    in the sm",
    "the decay @xmath26 is described by the quark level process @xmath28 through the effective hamiltonian : = v_tb v^*_tsc_10   |s _ ( 1 - _ 5 ) b     @xmath29 is the usual inami - lim function , given as : x(x_t ) = \\ { + ln(x_t ) } , [ eq : sec2:3 ] with @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , the unparticle transition at quark level can be described by @xmath31 , where we shall consider the following operators :  & &    |s _ b   ^+   |s _ _ 5 b   ^ , + vector  unparticle  operators  & &    |s _ b   ^  +    |s _ _ 5 b   ^ .",
    "[ eq : sec2:4 ]    before proceeding with our analysis note that we shall write the propagator for the scalar unparticle field as @xcite : d^4 x e^ip.x 0|t ( x ) ( 0 ) | 0 = i ( - p^2)^- 2 , [ eq : sec2:5 ] where @xmath32      using the sm effective hamiltonian for the quark level process @xmath33 , as given in equation ( [ eq : sec2:1 ] ) , we can calculate the differential decay width of @xmath34 ( using the form factor definitions for the @xmath35 transition as given in appendix [ appendix : a1 ] ) .    after taking into account the three species of sm neutrinos",

    "as listed earlier , the following scalar operators can contribute to the @xmath42 decay :   |s _ b   ^+   |s _ _ 5 b   ^=   |s _ ( + _ 5 ) b   ^ , [ eq : sec2:8 ] where we have defined our form factors in appendix a. as such , the matrix element for the process @xmath43 can be written as : ^s =    .",
    "[ eq : sec2:9 ] the decay rate for @xmath44 can now be evaluated to be : & = &   ||^2 ( m_b^2 + m_k^2 - 2 m_b e_k)^- 2 + & & ^2 .",

    "[ eq : sec2:11 ]    as can seen from the above expressions the scalar unparticle contribution to the decay rate for @xmath46 and @xmath47 will depend upon @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "this shall allow us to place constraints upon @xmath48 and @xmath49 from these two different decay modes .",
    "this issue shall be re - visited in the final section of this paper .",
    "along similar lines as followed in the previous subsection , we shall now make use of the vector unparticle operators : @xmath50 and the form factors of appendix a , to calculate the matrix element for @xmath44 : ^v =    ^ .",
    "[ eq : sec2:12 ] and as such we calculate the differential decay rate as : & = &   ||^2 |f_+|^2 ( m_b^2 + m_k^2 - 2 m_b e_k)^- 2 + & & \\ { - ( m_b^2 + m_k^2 + 2 m_b e_k ) + } . [ eq : sec2:14 ]    for the @xmath39 case the matrix element for @xmath45 is : ^v & = & \\ { ( i _ ( m_b + m_k^ * ) a_1 - i ( p + p)_(.q ) - i q _ ( .",

    "[ eq : sec2:15 ]    to obtain the total decay width for @xmath46 we must integrate over @xmath36 in the range @xmath51 , whereas to obtain the total decay width for @xmath52 we must integrate over @xmath53 in the range @xmath54 .",
    "the total contribution to @xmath25 can be written as : = ^sm + ^ , [ eq : res1 ] where the @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the sm and unparticle contributions to the @xmath25 decay .",
    "and we should note that in the sm the missing energy in the final state is attributed to the presence of neutrinos .",
    "hence the sm contribution to this process is given by @xmath26 .",
    "in the present case this signature can be mimicked by the process @xmath42 , where we shall now try to estimate the bounds on the unparticles from the experimental constraints on missing energy signatures , as given by the @xmath7-factories belle and babar @xcite : br(b k | ) & < & 1.4 10 ^ -5 , + br(b k^ * | ) & < & 1.4 10 ^ -4 .",
    "it is important to note that the sm process @xmath34 provides a unique energy distribution spectrum of final state hadrons ( @xmath57 in our case ) .",
    "presently the experimental limits on the branching ratio of these processes are about one order below the respective sm expectation values . however , these processes are expected to be measured at future superb factories . as such",
    ", we presently only have an upper limit on the branching ratio of these processes , where to estimate the constraints on the unparticle properties .",
    "note that h. georgi , in his first paper on unparticles , tried to emphasize that unparticles behave as a non - integral number of particles @xcite .",
    "he further went on to analyze the distribution of the @xmath58-quark in the decay @xmath59 .",
    "it was argued that the peculiar shape of the distributions of @xmath60 ( the energy of the @xmath58-quark ) may allow us to discover unparticles experimentally . as such",
    ", we have attempted to extend this same analogy to the process presently under consideration .",
    "finally , before presenting our numerical results , note that the future superb factories will be measuring the process @xmath61 by analyzing the spectra of the final state hadron . in doing this measurement at @xmath7-factories a cut for high momentum on the hadron",
    "is imposed , in order to suppress the background .",
    "recall that unparticles would give us an unique distribution for the high energy hadron in the final state , such that in future @xmath7-factories one will be able to distinguish the presence of a scale invariant sector ( or unparticles ) by observing the spectrum of final state hadrons in @xmath62 .    with this idea in mind",
    "we have tried to plot the differential decay width of @xmath25 as a function of @xmath63 ) in figure ( [ fig:1 ] ) . as we can see from these figures",
    "the unparticle operators ( especially the vector operators ) give us a very distinctive distribution for the final state hadron s energy .",
    "the distribution of the unparticle contribution is strikingly different when we include a vector operator for a highly energetic final state hadron . as such",
    ", unparticle stuff can give a distinctly different signature from the sm in this regime , which it should be noted is experimentally more favorable at future superb factories .",
    "in the next set of figures , figure ( [ fig:2 ] ) , we have tried to analyze the constraints on the unparticle s scaling dimensions ( @xmath23 ) from different values of the cut - off scale @xmath22 . in these plots",
    "we have used some specific values of the effective couplings @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "as we can see from these figures the branching ratio is very sensitive to the scale dimension @xmath23 and @xmath22 . in figure ( [ fig:3 ] )",
    "we have shown the same plots for @xmath66 . from these two figures",
    "we can observe that the vector operators are more strongly constrained as compared to scalar operators .",
    "the second feature is that @xmath67 provides better constraints than the @xmath68 decay .",
    "we have next tried to estimate the limits on the allowed values of the effective couplings , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , from the present experimental limits on the branching ratio of @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , in figure ( [ fig:4 ] ) we have shown the dependence of the branching ratio of @xmath67 on @xmath48 and @xmath64 .",
    "as we can see from the expressions of the differential decay rate for @xmath67 , given in the previous section , if we consider the scalar ( vector ) operators , then the rate for this process is only dependent on @xmath48 ( @xmath64 ) .    finally , in figure ( [ fig:5 ] ) we have shown the dependence of the branching ratio of @xmath68 on the effective vertices .",
    "if we consider scalar operators then the rate of this process is only dependent upon @xmath49 , whereas if we consider the vector operators then the rate can depend upon both @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "to re - emphasize these last few points :    * @xmath69 scalar unparticle operator shall constrain the parameter @xmath48 , * @xmath70 scalar unparticle operator shall constrain @xmath49 , * @xmath69 vector unparticle operator will constrain only @xmath64 , * whilst @xmath70 vector unparticle operator will constrain both @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    to conclude , in this work we have analyzed the effects of unparticles on the missing energy signatures of rare @xmath7-decays .",
    "we have tried to argue that @xmath25 provides very useful constraints on the parameters of the model , where we have considered four operators , namely the scalar , pseudo - scalar , vector and axial vector operators .",
    "both the modes @xmath67 and @xmath71 are different functions of these four operators , and hence provide independent constraints on the parameter space of the model .",
    "the set of operators we have considered , in principal , also contributes to meson anti - meson mixing , namely , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 mixing .",
    "detailed analyses of these , within the context of unparticle physics , has been done in reference @xcite .",
    "finally , note that the constraints provided by @xmath25 in some regions can be much stronger than the ones provided by meson anti - meson mixing .",
    "the work of ng was supported by jsps under grant no .",
    "ng would also like to thank yasuhiro okada and sukanta dutta for the discussions he had with them .",
    "we would also like to thank steven robertson and kai - feng chen for their comments regarding missing energy signatures at @xmath7-factories .",
