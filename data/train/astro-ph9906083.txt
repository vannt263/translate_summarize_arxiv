    "observations of the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission during the last twenty years have been successfully interpreted in terms of a two - folded structure + @xmath2 a highly anisotropic component strongly concentrated along the galactic disk , + @xmath2 an apparently isotropic component .",
    "+ while the former is evidently galactic in nature - being actually accounted for by cosmic ray ( cr ) interactions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite - the origin of the latter still remains an open problem in high - energy astrophysics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we will restrict our attention to the latter component throughout the present paper .",
    "we begin by recalling that egret observations have detected a diffuse @xmath0-ray flux @xcite @xmath3 with a spectral slope of @xmath4 , which - for @xmath5 gev - gives @xmath6    a question naturally arises . where does the @xmath0-ray emission in question come from ?",
    "no doubt , its characteristic isotropy calls for an extragalactic origin - an option which is further supported by the fact that it fits remarkably well with the extragalactic hard x - ray background @xcite .    the next question to address is whether the considered @xmath0-ray background arises from a truly diffuse process or rather from the contribution of very many unresolved point sources .",
    "either option has received considerable attention . among the theories of diffuse origin",
    "are a baryon - symmetric universe @xcite , primordial black hole evaporation @xcite , early collapse of supermassive black holes @xcite , a new population of geminga - like pulsars @xcite and wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) annihilation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "models based on discrete source contribution include a variety of possibilities .",
    "what is clear since a long time is that normal galaxies fail to account for the observed isotropic background - at least as long as their disk emission is considered @xcite-@xcite - since the corresponding intensity falls shorter by a factor @xmath7 with respect to the detected flux .",
    "a more realistic option is provided by active galaxies @xcite . indeed , blazars seem to yield a successful explanation of the isotropic @xmath0-ray emission @xcite-@xcite .",
    "finally , a somewhat hybrid model has recently been proposed , in which the isotropic @xmath0-ray background is produced in clusters of galaxies through the interaction of crs with the hot intracluster gas @xcite . however ,",
    "this model has been severely criticized @xcite .",
    "in fact , it gives rise to a @xmath0-ray spectral index in disagreement with the observed one and relies upon a value for the cr density in the intracluster space which is too high to be plausible .",
    "more generally , it has been shown that the contribution to the isotropic @xmath0-ray emission from clusters of galaxies is negligible @xcite .    recently , dixon et al .",
    "@xcite have re - analyzed the egret data concerning the diffuse @xmath0-ray flux with a wavelet - based technique , using the expected ( galactic plus isotropic ) emission as a null hypothesis .",
    "although the wavelet approach does not allow for a good estimate of the errors , they find a statistically significant diffuse emission from an extended halo surrounding the milky way .",
    "this emission traces a somewhat flattened halo and its intensity at high - galactic latitude is @xcite @xmath8 clearly , the comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) entails that the newly discovered halo @xmath0-ray flux is a relevant fraction of the standard isotropic diffuse emission ( at least for @xmath9 gev ) .",
    "our aim is to show that the observed halo @xmath0-ray emission naturally arises within a previously - proposed model for baryonic dark matter , according to which dark clusters of brown dwarfs and cold self - gravitating @xmath1 clouds populate the outer galactic halo and can show up in microlensing observations @xcite-@xcite . basically , cr protons in the galactic halo scatter on the clouds clumped into dark clusters , giving rise to the newly discovered @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "although we already pointed out that a signature of the model is a diffuse @xmath0-ray emission from the galactic halo @xcite , a more thorough study is required to compare the predicted intensity distribution with the observed one .",
    "a short account of these results has been presented elsewhere @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we provide a more exhaustive analysis .",
    "in addition , we estimate the @xmath0-ray emission from the nearby m31 galaxy .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the main features of our model for baryonic dark matter in the galactic halo . in section 3",
    "we address the cr confinement in the galactic halo and we estimate the cr energy density . in section 4",
    "we compute the halo @xmath0-ray flux - produced by the clouds clumped into dark clusters through proton - proton scattering - as detected on earth .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the study of the @xmath0-ray flux due to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of electrons off background photons . in section 6",
    "we present @xmath0-ray intensity maps , pertaining to both proton - proton scattering and ic scattering , and discuss their interplay .",
    "finally , in section 7 we address future prospects to test our predictions .",
    "ever since the discovery that standard big - bang nucleosynthesis correctly accounts for the light element abundances , a lesson has become clear : most of the baryons in the universe happen to be in nonluminous form , thereby making a strong case for baryonic dark matter .    in order to see how this comes about , we recall that the fraction of critical density contributed by luminous matter",
    "is estimated to be @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "] yet , agreement between the predicted and observed abundances of nucleosynthetic yields is achieved only provided the similar contribution from baryons - in whatever form - lies in the range @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "actually , this conclusion has recently been sharpened by deuterium measurements in quasi stellar object ( qso ) absorption spectra , which probe regions of space much farther away than previously explored and give @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "so , about @xmath14 of the baryonic matter in the universe is expected to be dark .",
    "needless to say , one is naturally led to wonder about the distribution and form of baryonic dark matter .",
    "several possibilities have been contemplated over the last few years .",
    "although no logically compelling reason in favour of any particular option has emerged so far , it looks intriguing that a naturalness argument strongly suggests that the galactic dark halos should be predominantly baryonic .    basically , the idea is as follows .",
    "as is well known , both optical and hi observations have shown that all galactic rotation curves exhibit a universal qualitative behaviour : after a steep rise corresponding to the bulge , they stay approximately constant out to the last measured point .",
    "this feature  namely the lack of a keplerian fall - off  provides a stark evidence in favour of a spheroidal dark halo surrounding the luminous part of any galaxy .",
    "this is however not the end of the story . for",
    ", rotation curves trace the luminous  hence baryonic ",
    "matter within the optical disk , but are dominated by the halo dark matter at larger galactocentric distances . yet , both contributions invariably turn out to match smoothly and exactly , thereby signalling a striking visible - invisible conspiracy ( also called disk - halo conspiracy ) . before proceeding further ,",
    "a point should be stressed . with only a rather limited sample of available rotation curves ,",
    "that conspiracy was initially understood as a fine - tuning whereby the disk and the halo of spiral galaxies manage to produce a flat rotation curve  @xcite .",
    "further studies have shown that such a flatness is only approximate : brighter galaxies tend to have slightly falling rotation curves , whereas fainter ones possess slightly rising rotation curves  @xcite .",
    "still , what really matters for the visible - invisible conspiracy ( as stated above ) is the lack of any jump in the rotation curve within the disk - halo transition region , besides the approximate flatness .",
    "a priori , only a mysterious fine - tuning could justify the conspiracy in question if the halo dark matter were different in nature from luminous matter , that is to say if it were nonbaryonic .",
    "so , baryonic dark matter looks like a natural constituent of galactic halos .",
    "incidentally , this situation is very reminiscent of the case of grand unified theories in particle physics , where supersymmetry has been invoked as a successful way out of a similar , mysterious fine - tuning needed to stabilize the gauge hierarchy against radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "thus , we are led to the conclusion that  much in the same way as fundamental interactions ought to be supersymmetric ",
    "galactic halos ought to be predominantly baryonic !    remarkably enough , a specific model of baryonic dark halos emerges naturally from the present - day understanding of globular clusters .",
    "indeed , a few years ago we have realized  @xcite that the fall - rees theory for the formation of globular clusters  @xcite-@xcite automatically predicts  without any further physical assumption  that dark clusters made of brown dwarfs   and cold @xmath1 clouds should lurk in the galactic halo at galactocentric distances larger than @xmath15 kpc .",
    "accordingly , the inner halo is populated by globular clusters , whereas the outer halo chiefly consists of dark clusters .",
    "below , we summarize the main features of our model .    although the mechanism of galaxy formation is not yet fully understood , the theory for the origin of globular clusters seems to be fairly well established - thanks to the pioneering work of fall and rees  @xcite - and can be summarized as follows .",
    "after its initial collapse , the proto - galaxy is expected to be shock heated up to its virial temperature @xmath16 k. because of thermal instability , density enhancements rapidly grow as the gas cools . actually , overdense regions cool more rapidly than average , and so proto - globular - cluster ( pgc ) clouds form in pressure equilibrium with the hot diffuse gas . when the pgc cloud temperature drops to @xmath17 k , hydrogen recombination occurs : at this stage ,",
    "the pgc cloud mass and size are @xmath18 and @xmath19 pc , respectively ( @xmath20 being the galactocentric distance ) . below @xmath17 k , an efficient cooling can be brought about only by photon emission from roto - vibrational transitions in @xmath1 . whether this mechanism is actually operative or not crucially depends on the intensity of the environmental ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation field , as we are now going to discuss .",
    "in fact , in the central region of the proto - galaxy an agn ( active galactic nucleus ) along with a first population of massive stars are expected to form , which act as strong sources of uv radiation that dissociates the @xmath1 molecules .",
    "it is not difficult to estimate that the @xmath1 destruction should occur for galactocentric distances smaller than @xmath15 kpc . as a consequence ,",
    "cooling is heavily suppressed in the inner halo , and so here the pgc clouds remain for a long time in quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium at temperature @xmath21 k , resulting in the imprinting of a characteristic mass @xmath22 . eventually , the uv flux decreases , thereby allowing for the formation and survival of @xmath1 .",
    "accordingly , the pgc clouds can further cool , collapse and fragment , ultimately producing ordinary stars clumped into globular clusters .",
    "what is most relevant for the present considerations is that in the outer halo ",
    "namely for galactocentric distances larger than @xmath15 kpc  no substantial @xmath1 destruction should take place , owing to the distance suppression of the uv flux .",
    "therefore , here the pgc clouds monotonically cool , collapse and fragment .",
    "when their number density exceeds @xmath23 @xmath24 , virtually all hydrogen gets converted to molecular form by three - body reactions ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , which makes in turn the cooling efficiency increase dramatically  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "no imprinting of a characteristic mass on the pgc clouds shows up , and the fragment jeans mass can drop to values considerably smaller than @xmath27 .",
    "the fragmentation process stops when the pgc clouds become optically thick to their own line emission  this happens for a fragment jeans mass as low as @xmath28  @xcite . in this manner",
    ", dark clusters containing brown dwarfs in the mass range @xmath29 should form in the outer halo .",
    "typical values of the dark cluster radius are @xmath7 pc .    in spite of the fact that the dark clusters resemble in many respects globular clusters , an important difference exists .",
    "since practically no nuclear reactions occur in the brown dwarfs , strong stellar winds are presently lacking .",
    "therefore the leftover gas - which is ordinarily expected to exceed 60% of the original amount - is not expelled from the dark clusters but remains confined inside them .",
    "thus , also cold gas clouds are clumped into the dark clusters .",
    "although these clouds are primarily made of @xmath1 , they should be surrounded by an atomic layer and a photo - ionized `` skin '' .",
    "typical values of the cloud radius are @xmath30 pc .",
    "besides accounting for the halo dark matter in a natural fashion - without demanding any new physical assumption - this model elegantly explains the visible - invisible conspiracy . for , whether ordinary matter is luminous or dark ultimately depends on the intensity of the environmental uv radiation field during the proto - galactic epoch - no fine - tuning is indeed involved",
    "moreover , the uv field in question is expected to be stronger for brighter galaxies . accordingly , brighter galaxies should have the dark clusters lying farther away from the galactic centre than fainter galaxies , thereby making the contribution of dark matter to the rotation curve of brighter galaxies less significant than for fainter ones : this circumstance precisely agrees with the above - mentioned observed pattern of rotation curves  @xcite .",
    "observationally , the present model makes a crucial prediction : very high - energy cosmic ray proton scattering on the clouds should give rise to a detectable diffuse gamma - ray flux from the halo of our galaxy .",
    "this topic will be dealt with in great detail in the next sections .",
    "further support in favour of the baryonic scenario in question comes from the understanding of the extreme scattering events : dramatic flux changes over several weeks during monitoring of compact radio quasars  @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that eses are not intrinsic variations , but rather apparent flux changes caused by refraction when a ( partially ) ionized cloud crosses the line of sight .",
    "recently , walker and wardle  @xcite pointed out that the first consistent explanation of eses requires the refracting clouds to have precisely the same properties of the cold @xmath1 clouds predicted by the present model ( it is their photo - ionized `` skin '' that causes the radio wave refraction ) .",
    "last but not least is the issue of machos ( massive astrophysical compact halo objects ) , detected since 1993 in microlensing experiments towards the magellanic clouds .",
    "regretfully , their origin remains controversial .",
    "although the events detected towards the smc ( small magellanic cloud ) seem to be a self - lensing phenomenon @xcite , a similar interpretation of all the events discovered towards the lmc ( large magellanic cloud ) looks unlikely  @xcite . yet  even if most of the machos are dark matter candidates lying in the galactic halo  their physical nature is unclear , since their average mass strongly depends on the still uncertain galactic model , ranging from @xmath31 for a maximal disk up to @xmath32 for a standard isothermal sphere .",
    "superficially , white dwarfs look as the best explanation , but the resulting excessive metallicity of the halo makes this option untenable , unless their contribution to halo dark matter is not substantial ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so , some variations on the theme of brown dwarfs have been explored .",
    "an option is that the galactic halo resembles more closely a minimal halo ( maximal disk ) rather than an isothermal sphere , in which case machos can still be brown dwarfs .",
    "clouds can give rise to microlensing events  @xcite . ] in this connection , two points should be stressed .",
    "first , a large fraction ( up to @xmath33 in mass ) can be binary systems - much like ordinary stars - thereby counting as twice more massive objects  @xcite .",
    "second , within our model brown dwarfs can actually be beige dwarfs - with mass substantially larger than @xmath34 - as suggested by hansen  @xcite , since a slow accretion mechanism from cloud gas is likely to occur  @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility has been pointed out by kerins and evans  @xcite . since in the present model",
    "the initial mass function obviously changes with the galactocentric distance ,   it can well happen that brown dwarfs dominate the halo mass density without however dominating the optical depth for microlensing .",
    "what are then machos ? quite recently , faint blue objects discovered by the hubble space telescope have been understood as old halo white dwarfs lying closer than @xmath35 kpc from the sun @xcite-@xcite : they look as a good candidate for machos within this context .    finally , we remark that recently iso observations @xcite of the nearby ngc891 galaxy have detected a huge amount of molecular hydrogen , which might account for almost all dark matter , at least within its optical radius .",
    "other observations suggest that similar clouds are also present farther away @xcite .",
    "in addition , sciama @xcite has argued that a known excess in the far - infrared emissivity of our galaxy ( over that expected from a standard warm interstellar dust model ) would be naturally accounted for by a population of cold @xmath1 clouds building up a thick galactic disk .",
    "neither theory nor observation allow at present to make sharp statements about the propagation of crs in the galactic halo   10 kpc . ] .",
    "therefore , the only possibility to get some insight into this issue rests upon the extrapolation from the knowledge of cr propagation in the disk . actually , this strategy looks sensible , since the leading effect is cr scattering on inhomogeneities of the magnetic field over scales from @xmath36 pc down to less than @xmath37 pc @xcite and - according to our model - inhomogeneities of this kind are expected to be present in the halo as well , because of the existence of molecular clouds - with a photo - ionized `` skin '' - clumped into dark clusters . indeed ,",
    "typical values of the dark cluster radius are @xmath7 pc , whereas typical values of the cloud radius are @xmath30 pc @xcite .",
    "as is well known , crs up to energies of @xmath16 gev are confined in the galactic disk for @xmath38 yr @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that in the diffusion model for the propagation of crs , the escape time @xmath39 is given by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the diffusion coefficient , while @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the half - thickness of the disk and the radius of the confinement region , respectively .",
    "we remind that - for cr propagation in the disk - the diffusion coefficient is @xmath44 @xmath45 s@xmath11 in the ultra - relativistic regime , whereas it reads @xmath46 @xmath45 s@xmath11 in the non - relativistic regime @xcite .",
    "crs escaping from the disk will further diffuse in the galactic halo , where they can be retained for a long time , owing to the scattering on the above - mentioned small inhomogeneities of the halo magnetic field .",
    "indirect evidence that crs are in fact trapped in a low - density halo has recently been reported .",
    "for example , simpson & connell @xcite argue that , based on measurements of isotopic abundances of the cosmic ratio @xmath47al/@xmath48al , the cr lifetimes are perhaps a factor of four larger than previously thought , thereby implying that crs traverse an average density smaller than that of the galactic disk .",
    "a straightforward extension of the diffusion model implies that the cr escape time @xmath49 from the halo ( of size @xmath50 kpc , much larger than the disk half - thickness ) is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the diffusion coefficient in the galactic halo .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "radio observations in clusters of galaxies yield for the corresponding diffusion constant @xmath53 a value similar to that found in the galactic disk @xcite.g and 1 @xmath54 g @xcite .",
    "] so , it looks plausible that a similar value for @xmath53 also holds on intermediate length scales , namely within the galactic halo . in the lack of any further information on the energy - dependence of @xmath52",
    ", we assume the same dependence as that established for the disk .",
    "hence , from eq .",
    "( [ tau2 ] ) we find that for energies @xmath55 gev the escape time of crs from the halo is greater than the age of the galaxy @xmath56 yr ( notice that below the ultra - relativistic regime @xmath49 gets even longer ) . as a consequence - since the cr flux scales like @xmath57 ( see next section ) - protons with @xmath55 gev turn out to give the leading contribution to the cr flux .",
    "we are now in position to evaluate the cr energy density in the galactic halo , getting @xmath58 where @xmath59 erg s@xmath11 is the galactic cr luminosity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "notice , for comparison , that @xmath60 turns out to be about one - tenth of the disk value @xcite .",
    "in fact , this value is consistent with the egret upper bound on the cr density in the halo near the smc @xcite .",
    "we remark that we have taken specific realistic values for the various parameters entering the above equations in order to make a quantitative estimate .",
    "however , somewhat different values can be used .",
    "for instance , @xmath61 may range up to @xmath62 kpc @xcite , whereas @xmath53 might be slightly larger than the above value , e.g. @xmath63 @xmath45 s@xmath11 consistently with our assumptions .",
    "moreover , @xmath64 can be as large as @xmath65 erg s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that these variations do not substantially affect our previous conclusions .",
    "we proceed to estimate the halo @xmath0-ray flux produced by the clouds clumped into dark clusters through the interaction with high - energy cr protons . cr protons scatter on cloud protons giving rise ( in particular ) to neutral pions , which subsequently decay into photons .",
    "a highly nontrivial question concerns the opacity effects in the clouds .",
    "quite recently , kalberla et al .",
    "@xcite have addressed precisely this issue , showing that optical - depth effects for both protons and photons are negligible within our model . finally , we expect an irrelevant high - energy ( @xmath66 100 mev ) @xmath0-ray photon absorption outside the clouds , since the mean free path is orders of magnitudes larger than the halo size .    as far as the energy - dependence of the halo crs is concerned",
    ", we adopt the same power - law as in the galactic disk ( see below ) @xcite @xmath67 the constant @xmath68 is fixed by the requirement that the integrated energy flux agrees with the above value of @xmath69 . explicitly @xmath70 where for definiteness we take the integration range to be @xmath71 .",
    "a nontrivial point concerns the choice of @xmath72 . as an orientation",
    ", the observed spectrum of primary crs on earth would yield @xmath73 .",
    "however , this conclusion can not be extrapolated to an arbitrary region in the halo ( and in the disk ) , since @xmath72 crucially depends on the diffusion processes undergone by crs .",
    "for instance , the best fit to egret data in the disk towards the galactic centre yields @xmath74 @xcite , thereby showing that @xmath72 gets increased by diffusion . in the lack of any direct information ,",
    "we conservatively take @xmath73 even in the halo , but in table 1 we report some results for different values of @xmath72 for comparison . at any rate ,",
    "the flux does not vary substantially .",

    "accordingly , the source function @xmath95 - yielding the photon number density at distance @xmath96 from earth with energy greater than @xmath76 - is @xcite @xmath97 where the lower integration limit @xmath98 is the minimal proton energy necessary to produce a photon with energy @xmath99 , @xmath100 is the cross - section for the reaction @xmath101 ( @xmath102 is the @xmath103 multiplicity ) , @xmath104 is the halo gas density profile and @xmath105 is the photon multiplicity .    unfortunately , it would be exceedingly difficult to keep track of the clumpiness of the actual gas distribution in the halo , and so we assume that its density is smooth and goes like the dark matter density - anyhow , the very low angular resolution of @xmath0-ray detectors would not permit to distinguish between the two situations ( evidently this strategy would be meaningless if optical - depth effects were not negligible ) .",
    "accordingly , the halo gas density profile reads @xmath106 for @xmath107 , ( @xmath108 kpc is the minimal galactocentric distance of the dark clusters in the galactic halo ) .",

    "another mechanism whereby @xmath0-ray photons are produced is ic scattering of high - energy cr electrons off galactic background photons .",
    "here we estimate the resulting flux , while the interplay between proton - proton scattering and ic scattering will be discussed in the next section .",

    "however , what is relevant is the electron spectrum where the @xmath0-ray production occurs and - due to diffusion processes - the value of @xmath148 is expected to increase with the distance from the galactic plane where the electrons are mostly produced . in order to estimate the galactic radiation field ,",
    "we adopt the model of mazzei , xu & de zotti @xcite for the photometric evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "this model reproduces well the present broad - band spectrum of the galaxy over about four decades in frequency , from uv to far - ir .",

    "electrons diffuse through the galaxy and their distribution is energy - dependent and not uniform , namely , the characteristic diffusion length scale gets smaller for higher electron energy .",
    "this feature can not be described in the framework of the widely used leaky box model , and in order to obtain the electron density at an arbitrary point in the galaxy one has to resort to the transport equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , several fairly unknown parameters enter this equation , like the electron diffusion coefficient , the rate at which electrons lose energy , the density of sources and the electron spectrum .",
    "an alternative approach relies upon the experimental evidence of the thick disk , in which high - energy electrons may be retained for a long time before escaping into the galactic halo .",
    "indeed , the observed characteristics of the radio emission spectra of our and other galaxies lead to a relative density distribution of electrons @xmath171 extending up to @xmath172 kpc perpendicularly to the galactic plane , as shown in figure 5.29 of @xcite .",

    "as far as the radial dependence of the electron distribution is concerned , we assume that @xmath177 follows the same @xmath20-dependance of the crs , which can be obtained by using a best fit procedure to the data in figure 11 of @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath178}~. \\label{eqno:4}\\ ] ] however , following bloemen @xcite - who suggested a stronger radial gradient for the electron component of the crs - we also tested the effect of using a steeper radial electron distribution on the ic @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "we anticipate that the corresponding results show that the ic @xmath0-ray flux does not change significantly for galactic longitudes @xmath179 ( irrespectively of the latitude values ) while it increases up to a factor of two at @xmath180 for @xmath181 .",

    "however , the shape of the contour lines strongly depends on the flatness parameter .",
    "indeed , for @xmath229 there are two contour lines ( for each flux value ) approximately symmetric with respect to @xmath230 ( see figure 1a ) . on the other hand , for @xmath231",
    "there is a single contour line ( for each value of the flux ) which varies much less with the longitude ( see figure 1b ) .    as we can see from table 1 and figures 1 , the predicted value for the halo @xmath0-ray flux at high - galactic latitude is close to that found by dixon et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also table 3 ) .",

    "@xcite entails that models with flatness parameter @xmath232 are in better agreement with the data , thereby implying that most likely the halo dark matter is not spherically distributed .",
    "this result has been also recently confirmed in the analysis by @xcite .    in figure 2 we present contour plots for the @xmath0-ray flux due to the ic scattering , for @xmath5 gev .",

    "our calculation , however , seems to point out that the ic contour lines in figure 2 decrease much more rapidly than the observed ones for the halo @xmath0-ray emission ( see figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "more precise measurements with a next generation of satellites are certainly required in order to settle the issue .",
    "as m31 resembles our galaxy , the discovery of dixon et al .",
    "@xcite naturally leads to the expectation that the halo of m31 should give rise to a @xmath0-ray emission as well .",
    "below , we will try to address this issue in a quantitative manner , assuming that the halo of m31 is structurally similar to that of our galaxy and that our model for baryonic dark matter is correct .",
    "we suppose that the various parameters entering the calculations in sections 3 and 4 take similar values for m31 and for the galaxy , apart from the m31 central dark matter density @xmath243 g @xmath24 and the m31 core radius @xmath244 kpc .",
    "accordingly , the evaluation of the corresponding flux @xmath245 proceeds as before , with only minor modifications .",

    ", we suppose that the m31 halo is described by an isothermal sphere with radius @xmath61 and density profile @xmath255 note that the ensuing amount of dark matter in m31 turns out to be about twice as large as that of the galaxy .    according to the discussion in section 2",
    ", the dark clusters should populate only the outer halo of m31 .",
    "so , we compute @xmath245 from regions of the m31 halo with @xmath256 , with @xmath108 kpc and @xmath257 kpc , for definiteness . as it is easy to see ,",

    "( [ eqno : m3144 ] ) and ( [ eqno : m3145 ] ) , and so @xmath245 should be regarded as a lower bound on the total @xmath0-ray flux from m31 halo .",
    "specifically , eq . ( [ eqno : m3145 ] ) yields @xmath265    this value has to be compared both with the @xmath0-ray flux from m31 disk and with the @xmath0-ray emission from the halo of the galaxy .",

    "as far as observation is concerned , no @xmath0-ray flux from m31 has been detected by egret .",

    "( [ m31 ] ) and ( [ m31obs ] ) is hindered by the fact that eq .",
    "( [ m31obs ] ) is derived under the assumption of a point - like source .",
    "clearly , a good angular resolution of about one degree or less is necessary in order to discriminate between the halo and disk emission from m31 .",
