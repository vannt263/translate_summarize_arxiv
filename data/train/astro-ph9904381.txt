    "the picture that has emerged from a suite of multi - wavelength observations of the galactic center is that it contains a rotating , clumpy molecular ring ( also known as the circumnuclear disk- cnd ) which is heated by a centrally concentrated source ( the irs 16 cluster ) of uv radiation . within the ring s central cavity , three `` arms '' of ionized gas ( sgr a west )",
    "are generally in orbital motion around the center , which is believed to contain a @xmath1 2.5@xmath210@xmath3 black hole ( ekart and genzel 1996 ; ghez et al .",
    "the coincidence in the geometry and kinematics of the southwestern edge of the molecular ring and ionized gas suggests that the ionized gas is dynamically coupled to the inner edge of the circumnuclear ring .",
    "the western edge of the ring ( sometimes called the western arc ) is out of the plane of the sky and obscuring the background stars and absorbing br @xmath4 emission from the western arm causing the ratio of h92@xmath5 to br @xmath4 to increase ( see recent reviews by genzel , hollenbach and townes 1994 ; morris and serabyn 1997 ) .",
    "although the cnd is often described as having a circular geometry and kinematics , ( e.g. morris and serabyn 1997 and the references cited therein ) , the ring structure shows deviations from circular geometry .",
    "a prominent gap in the distribution of molecular gas in the cnd shows non - circular moving gas ( e.g. jackson et al .",
    "the cnd gap is located where an ionized `` streamer '' appears to run along the extension of the n. arm beyond the cnd .",
    "the thermal ionized gas in the streamers show that the northern arm of sgr a west is not coupled dynamically and spatially to the molecular gas in the inner edge of the cnd .    on a larger scale",
    "the non - thermal structure known as sgr a east is thought to be a shell - type explosive event , possibly a supernova remnant ( snr ) , surrounding the thermal source sgr a west .",
    "the recent discovery of oh(1720mhz ) masers at the interface of the 50  molecular cloud and sgr a east provides strong evidence that these two are physically interacting with each other ( e.g. mezger et al .",
    "1996 ; zylka et al . 1992 ; serabyn et al . 1992 ; yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "the masers are detected to the southeast of sgr a east ( sources a , d - g ) as well as to the northwest of the cnd .",
    "the maser spots surrounding the sgr a east shell have radial velocities near 50  close to the systemic velocity of the snr .",
    "the expansion of a supernova into the sgr a east molecular cloud ( i.e. the 50  cloud ) is considered to be responsible for the production of the shocked oh(1720 mhz ) maser emission .",
    "the nature of the association between the two systems , sgr a east and sgr a west and their corresponding molecular clouds , is not well established .",
    "radio continuum studies have pointed out the curious alignment of the western edge of sgr a east and the western arc of sgr a west ( ekers et al .",
    "1983 ; yusef - zadeh and morris 1987 ; pedlar et al . 1989 ) .",
    "sgr a east is behind sgr a west , a conclusion based on low - frequency observations showing a hole in the distribution of ionized gas toward the arms of sgr a west ( yusef - zadeh and morris 1987 ; pedlar et al . 1989 ) .",
    "these observations imply that a segment of the sgr a east shell must lie behind the galactic center by a distance that is estimated to range between a few to hundreds of parsecs .    the relative location of sgr a east with respect to the galactic center is of interest for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the separation between the two systems is relevant to the role that the relativistic particles of sgr a east may play in upscattering the cnd s ir and uv photons to high energies .",
    "the strength of this interaction depends on the distance between sgr a east and the cnd .",
    "this process was recently incorporated into the modeling the high - energy emission from the galactic center based on egret measurements ( melia et al .",
    "1998a , b ; fatuzzo et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this model ,",
    "sgr a east is considered to be within 5pc of the galactic center .",
    "second , the disturbance of the molecular ring by sgr a east also depends upon the separation between the two objects .",
    "recent studies suggest that the n. arm of sgr a west may delineate the inner edge of an infalling `` tongue '' of neutral gas toward the galactic center .",
    "the obvious question that needs to be addressed is whether sgr a east is responsible for the observed deviation from circular motion at the location of the gap in the cnd and for the infalling cloud .",
    "lastly , the closeness of sgr a east to the galactic center and its unusual energetics brings up the possibility that the sources responsible for the explosion are the family of young , massive stars in the irs 16 cluster .",
    "this hypothesis may provide an insight into the nature of massive star formation within the same parent cloud in the inner 5pc of the galactic center .",
    "a signature of an interaction between sgr a east and the cnd should be shocked gas as the blast wave of sgr a east compresses the gas in the cnd .",
    "the unambiguous detection of shocked ( as opposed to uv - heated ) gas associated with the galactic center has been difficult",
    ". the intensity ratios of the v=21 and 10 s(1 ) lines of h@xmath0 ( gatley et al .",
    "1984 ; burton & allen 1992 ; pak et al . 1996 ) are often consistent with collisional excitation rather than fluorescence , but the high density of the molecular gas at the galactic center and the intense uv radiation field in the region allow the line ratios from uv - irradiated gas to resemble those of shock - heated gas ( sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ) .",
    "however , the presence of the oh 1720 mhz line , and the absence of the 1665/1667 mhz lines provides a clear diagnostic of shocked molecular gas , as the fir radiation field from warm dust in uv - heated clouds would pump the latter transitions . here",
    "we report preliminary results of our new h@xmath0 and [ feii ] and 1.2 and 90 cm radio continuum observations and examine the interaction picture of sgr a east with the cnd .",
    "we observed the galactic center in the 10 s(1 ) transition of h@xmath0 line using both the nicmos on the hst as well unswirf on the aat .",
    "the unswirf observations were carried out using four overlapping frames with a size of 90@xmath6 , a pixel size of 0.77@xmath6 and channel maps separated by @xmath739  ( figs .",
    "1,2 and 3 ) .",
    "using camera 3 of nicmos , a total of 12 overlapping frames each with a 52@xmath6 size and a pixel size of 0.203@xmath6 was observed in both the line and the continuum . each frame",
    "was dithered by 16@xmath6 in each principal directions of the detector , and the final image was constructed by mosaicing all 12 frames , a portion of which is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the 90 cm continuum observations were carried out in the bna ( fig .",
    "4 ) and a - array configurations ( figs . 5 and 6 ) of the very large array of the national radio astronomy observatory . camera 3 of nicmos was also used to observe the [ feii ] line emission from the central 110@xmath8 , a subsection of which is shown in figure 8b .",
    "the nicmos images were produced by subtracting images in the 1% filter centered on the 1.64@xmath9 m [ feii ] line .",
    "the continuum was adjusted to minimize the stellar residuals , but both positive and negative residuals remain .",
    "some of the residuals are due to differences in intrinsic colors and locally patchy extinction .",
    "these observations have provided wealth of structural details with subarcsecond resolution capability of the nicmos , the velocity information from unswirf , and the ability to discriminate line from continuum emission that unswirf gives .",
    "the high resolution 1.2 cm image were based on combined a and b array configurations whereas the low - resolution image was based on c configuration .",
    "the astrometry of the radio and ir images was done by using the position of irs 7 with respect to sgr a@xmath10 ( menten et al .",
    "1995 ) . a detailed account of these observations will be given elsewhere .",
    "figure 1 shows contours of 10 s(1 ) h@xmath0 line emission measured by unswirf superposed on the greyscale 6 cm continuum emission from sgr a west and east ( yusef - zadeh and morris 1987 ) .",
    "a segment of the sgr a east nonthermal shell is seen to the ne near @xmath11 whereas the spiral - shaped structure of sgr a west is evident near the center of the figure .",
    "the peaks located in the ne ( n. lobe ) and sw ( s. lobe ) parts of the ring are consistent with limb - brightening of the inner edges along the principal axis .",
    "an extended h@xmath0 feature with a plume - like appearance is noted within the ring .",
    "this new feature appears to terminate at the position of irs 7 ( a more detailed account of this feature will be given elsewhere ) .",
    "the distribution of h@xmath0 line emission appears like a ring surrounding sgr a west except in the region near @xmath12 , where the hcn distribution indicates non - circular motion . at the location of the inner gap ( jackson et al . 1993 ) . a long filamentary structure with an extent of @xmath13",
    "is discovered to the nw of the cnd .",
    "a gap is noticed along the extent of the filament near @xmath14 which shows a similarity in its spatial distribution to the iner gap of the cnd .",
    "the crosses in all the figures show the positions of oh ( 1720mhz ) masers and the star symbol is coincident with the position of sgr a@xmath10 .",
    "the c and b masers with velocities of 43 and 134   are seen near the outer and inner gaps of h@xmath0 distribution .",
    "figure 2 shows the same contours as in figure 1 , but they are now superposed on the greyscale h@xmath0 image based on the nicmos observations .",
    "because of the complex nature of galactic center sources , the stellar continuum in nicmos images has not been removed completely .",
    "there is an overall agreement between the nicmos and unswirf data in spite of the contamination from stellar continuum in nicmos images .",
    "the new h@xmath0 filament appears strikingly sharp with a width of about 0.5@xmath6 in the nicmos image .",
    "figure 3 shows the velocity distribution of h@xmath0 emission based on one 90@xmath6 field centered near the n. lobe as observed with unswirf .",
    "the crosses indicate the position of the masers .",
    "the n. lobe of the cnd appears prominantly at higher velocities near the 120 and 159   channel maps .",
    "the new h@xmath0 filament appears as a coherent velocity feature and is best seen in the 41.2 and 80.4 channel maps .",
    "the c maser with a velocity of 43  is probably related to the new h@xmath0 filament , whereas the b masers , with velocities of about 134 are associated with the n. lobe .",
    "the overall velocity structure of the new filament is also similar to that of the inner edge of the cnd near the western arc , suggesting that the new filament is part of the cnd but outlining the outer edge of the cnd .",
    "a ridge of weak h@xmath0 emission is also seen in the 41 and 80  channel maps .",
    "this feature appears to connect the two gaps , as seen in the new filament and in the inner edge of the cnd , suggesting that the h@xmath0 features are indeed associated with each other .",
    "figure 4 shows the greyscale distribution of 90 cm emission superposed on contours of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the hole at the center is due to free - free absorption of the arms of sgr a west against sgr a east .",
    "the 90 cm image also shows the ionized streamers in absorption at the position of the inner and outer gaps .",
    "the elongated structure of sgr a east , which is saturated in this image , delineates the bright shell of sgr a east .",
    "the western edge of the shell is weaker in its surface brightness due to optical depth effect but what is clear is a deviation from a shell - like geometry to the west of the cnd .",
    "we also note that the cnd is clearly surrounded by nonthermal emission ( pedlar et al .",
    "1989 ) not only to its western edge but also to its eastern edge .",
    "the prominent eastern shell of sgr a east lies near @xmath15 which is about 1.5@xmath16 east of the eastern edge of the cnd .",
    "figure 5 presents a more close up view of the 90 cm emission with a higher resolution where contours of hcn emission ( wright et al .",
    "1987 ) appear to be surrounded by sgr a east .",
    "in addition , the 90 cm emission shows an elongated weak nonthermal feature within the hole . the striking feature in this image is the continuum emission crossing the bar of ionized gas associated with sgr a west .",
    "this shows clearly a lack of free - free absorption of a segment of the bar against sgr a east .",
    "figure 6 shows contours of 90 cm emission superposed on a greyscale 1.2 cm continuum image of sgr a west showing the extent of the elongated low - frequency feature with respect to sgr a west and sgr a@xmath10 .",
    "the presence of low - frequency 90 cm emission from the direction of the bar and sgr a@xmath10 is surprising because the bar of ionized gas is known to be the brightest feature with the highest ionized density in sgr a west .",
    "if sgr a east lies behind sgr a west , the bar should have the largest optical depth at 90 cm .",
    "this suggests that the sgr a east shell is not totally behind sgr a west as the elongated feature which is probably a nonthermal feature associated with sgr a east crosses the hole created by free - free absorption .",
    "in fact , the comparison of the molecular and ionized material with the 90 cm image , as presented in figures 5 and 6 , gives the impression of an anti - correlation between the molecular material and the 90 cm emission .",
    "the lack of nonthermal emission from sgr a east versus the free - free absorption of thermal sgr a west against sgr a east will be considered in more detail elsewhere .",
    "radio continuum emission at @xmath171.2 cm traces the distribution of thermal gas in sgr a west and is unlikely to be contaminated by the nonthermal sgr a east given its steep radio spectrum in radio wavelengths ( pedlar et al . 1989 ) .",
    "figure 7 shows contours of hcn emission superposed against the 1.2 cm greyscale of sgr a west .",
    "this figure shows the prominent three arms of sgr a west and a faint arm of ionized gas which appears to delineate the outer western edge of the cnd .",
    "this new and extended ionized feature runs between @xmath18 and @xmath19 and has a typical brightness between 0.5 to 1.5 mjy / beam with a beam size of 1.58@xmath20 .",
    "there is also a peak of 90 cm emission coincident with the new high - frequency 1.2 cm feature near @xmath21 with a flux density of 80 mjy in a beam of @xmath22 .",
    "it appears that the western edge of the cnd is sandwiched by two ionized layers from east and west along the inner and outer edges of the cnd , respectively .",
    "the eastern or the inner layer of the cnd is traced by the s. arm ( i.e. the western arc ) and is ionized by the strong uv radiation field originated by the irs 16 cluster .",
    "the western or the outer layer of ionized gas is identified as a new and weakly emitting arm of ionized gas tracing the outer edge of the cnd .",
    "the latter can either be due to photoionization by the radiation field from nearby stars lying outside the cnd or by shocked gas as a result of an interaction with sgr a east as a j - type shock is driven into the cnd .",
    "we note prominent dark patches distributed throughout the h@xmath0 images .",
    "these dark features which are best seen in nicmos images in figure 2 are extended and appear to be concentrated prominantly along the inner and outer gaps of the cnd and along the remarkably extended structure nw of the h@xmath0 filament .",
    "although the lack of proper removal of stellar continuum contributes to the absorption features in nicmos images , all the features noted here are extended , have been detected in continuum images and show atomic or molecular couterparts .",
    "estimates of the extiction toward these patches will be given elsewhere .",
    "an example of the dark feature in figure 2 is located near the n. lobe but to the south of the inner gap of the cnd near @xmath23 .",
    "this feature coincides with the well - known oi and dust feature within the cnd ( davidson et al 1992 ; jackson et al .",
    "1993 ; telesco et al .",
    "the oi feature is thought to lie in the cnd with h@xmath0 density of 3@xmath24 @xmath25 and a mass of 300 suggesting that the dark feature in this region is located at the galactic center .",
    "the strongest support for this suggestion comes from the distribution of radio continuum emission at 1.2 cm and the distribution of [ feii ] feature based on the vla and hst / nicmos measurements .",
    "figure 8a shows the n. arm of sgr a west and a faint semi - circular shell structure surrounding the northern tip of the n. arm .",
    "this weak shell - like ionized feature with a typical brightness of 0.2 mjy within a beam of 0.3@xmath26 coincides with the outer rim of the oi / dust feature and the dark h@xmath0 patch .",
    "this shell of ionized feature suggests that the the dark patch is photoionized externally .",
    "figure 8b shows the distribution of [ feii ] in the same region as shown in figure 8a .",
    "a dearth of [ feii ] emission corresponding to the northern half of the n. arm is seen at the position of h@xmath0 dark patch .",
    "both the [ feii ] and h@xmath0 features are surrounded by a rim of ionized gas in the 1.2 cm image .",
    "we note a lack of correlation along the northern arm in 1.2 cm and [ feii ] images , as shown in figures 8a and b. the northern half of the n. arm also shows a sudden drop by a factor of 2 in its brightness to the north of @xmath27 ( yusef - zadeh and wardle 1993 ) . considering that free - free emission at 1.2 cm is optically thin , the drop in the emission measure as the northern arm crosses the shell is a strong support for the association of the oi / dust feature with the n. arm .",
    "the coincidence of oi / dust emitting feature with the dark features and an ionized rim surrounding them suggests that they are all located within the cnd .",
    "further support comes from a drop in the emission measure of optically thin free - free emission from the n. arm at 1.2 cm . a detailed examination of the ionized gas in sgr a west shows also a number of dramatic dark features which can not be explained by a lack of short - spacing data .",
    "these dark continuum features are likely to delineate the region of cold dust and gas where the emission measure drops significantly .",
    "recent proper motion results show the direction of the ionized flow supporting the infall picture of the n. arm toward the galactic center ( yusef - zadeh , roberts and biretta 1998 ; zhao and goss 1998 ) .",
    "the large - scale distribution of dark features in the h@xmath0 images suggests that the 50   could be responsible for the infall of neutral material toward the galactic center as evidenced by the disturbed molecular material in the cnd at the location of the inner and outer gaps .",
    "the location of the dark patches along the n. arm , near sgr a@xmath10 , suggests that the atomic and molecular gas survives well within the cavity of ionized gas .",
    "we also note the darkest feature lying close to the irs 16 cluster with very bright continuum emission . because of the strong stellar emission from the irs 16 cluster",
    ", this dark feature may be due to artefacts from imperfect continuum subtraction . however , it is interesting to note that the dark feature coincides with the highly blue shifted h@xmath0co , oh , hi and hco@xmath28 absorption features , with velocities of about 190 .",
    "( marr et al . 1993 ; pauls et al .",
    "1993 ; yusef - zadeh et al.1993 ; yusef - zadeh 1994 ; zhao et al .",
    "the kinematic and spatial distribution of the absorbing gas suggest that the gas is located at the galactic center ( see liszt and burton 1995 for an alternative interpretation ) .",
    "the new h@xmath0 filament running parallel to the nonthermal shell of sgr a east supports the picture that the impact of the nonthermal shell of sgr a east with a molecular cloud is responsible for shocked h@xmath0 emission from the filament .",
    "additional support for the shock hypothesis comes from the sheet - like morphology and the location of maser source c along the filament .",
    "the radial velocity of the c maser is about 43  which is within the h@xmath0 velocity range of velocities of 40 and 80 as shown in figure 3 .",
    "these so - called supernova masers are thought to be excellent tracers of shocks and are seen primarily in regions where snr s are interacting with molecular clouds ( wardle et al .",
    "1998 ; green et al . 1998 ; frail et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the lack of any thermal continuum or br @xmath4 emission at the location of the new filament is consistent with the c - type shocks being responsible for exciting the oh gas ( wardle et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the compelling evidence that the new filament traces the shocked molecular gas by the expansion of the sgr a east shell into the cloud raises the question of the location of the filamentary shocked gas with respect to the cnd .",
    "it is possible that either the shocked gas is associated with the 50  cloud and it happens to be aligned fortuitously along the outer edge of the cnd or that the outer edge of the cnd is shocked externally as a result of its interaction with sgr a east .",
    "what follows is a series of arguments in support of the outer boundary of the cnd being collisionally excited by the expansion of the nonthermal sgr a east into the cnd .",
    "first , the anti - correlation of the streamers of ionized gas and molecular gas at the positions of the inner and outer h@xmath0 gaps show compelling morphological evidence for the association of the streamers of sgr a west and the new h@xmath0 filament which traces the shocked gas associated with the 50  molecular cloud .",
    "second , the inner and outer boundary where the gaps are observed show similar velocity distributions suggesting that they both must be part of the molecular ring . a ridge of h@xmath0 emission linking the new filament to the inner edge of the cnd furthers the support for the physical association between them .",
    "third , the evidence that sgr a east and the cnd are physically interacting with each other comes from detailed 90 cm observations of the galactic center . in these images , the western and eastern edges of the cnd",
    "appear to be engulfed by a shell of radio continuum emission at 90 cm .",
    "the emission at these low - frequencies are due to nonthermal processes and is expected to be associated with sgr a east .",
    "in addition , the evidence for low - frequency emission from the region of the bar and absorption of the arms of sgr a west add further evidence that sgr a east surrounds the cnd .",
    "the high frequency radio emission delineating the outer edge of the western arc of the cnd could also be used as an argument for the interaction hypothesis if the radiation field outside the cnd is not strong enough to ionize the outer edge of the cnd .",
    "a lack of [ feii ] emission from the northern half of the n. arm and its correlation with oi / dust emission and h@xmath0 dark patches as well as a number of kinematically disturbed features in the cnd all could be used as implications of a scenario in which a cold dust cloud plunges into the cnd by an energetic phenomena .",
    "lastly , the recombination line emission toward sgr a east and sgr a@xmath10 show stimulated thermal gas at velocities near 50  ( anantharamaiah et al . 1998 ; roberts and goss 1993 ) .",
    "it is possible that the thermal ionized gas is associated with the 50  molecular cloud .",
    "if so , a part of the 50  molecular cloud with which sgr a east is interacting must be in front the of galactic center .",
    "the conclusion that sgr a east and the cnd are interacting is inescapable based on various lines of evidence and arguments given above",
    ". a further test of this model could be done by measuring the intensity ratio of v=21 and 10 s(1 ) line emission from the region already observed presented in v=10 s(1 ) line .",
    "the implication of such an interaction is that the inverse compton scattering of ir and uv photons should not be ignored in modeling the high - energy emission from the galactic center .",
    "furthermore , the disturbance of the gas in the inner edge of the cnd is caused by the impact of sgr a east .",
    "these suggest that sgr a east is responsible for pushing gas cloud into the cavity . in this scenario ,",
    "the n. arm traces the trajectory of the infalling cloud as it is ionized by the strong uv radiation field of the irs 16 cluster .",
    "the three - dimensional motion of ionized gas based on proper motion and radial velocity measurements ( yusef - zadeh , roberts and biretta 1998 ; zhao and goss 1998 ) is consistent with this picture .",
    "the dark patches seen within the inner 30@xmath6 of sgr a@xmath10 , in the cnd coincident with oi feature , in the inner and outer gaps and the extended dark feature to the nw of the filament in nicmos image of h@xmath0 distribution gives the impression that the 50  molecular cloud may in fact be responsible for feeding the galactic center ( see coil and ho 1998 ) .",
    "lastly , this interaction picture of sgr a east and the cnd may shed some new light on the possibility of the common origin of the irs 16 cluster and the progenitor of stars responsible for the formation of sgr a east ."
