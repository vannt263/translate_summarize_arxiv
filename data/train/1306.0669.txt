    "in the last two decades , various quantum information protocols like quantum teleportation  @xcite , super dense coding  @xcite , and entanglement - based quantum cryptography  @xcite were discovered in which quantum mechanics is used to achieve higher efficiencies than their classical counterparts .",
    "most of these protocols use entanglement  @xcite as the resource .",
    "however , notable exceptions exist .",
    "in particular , there exists orthogonal product states which are not perfectly distinguishable by measurements based on local operations and classical communication  @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in deterministic quantum computation with one qubit  @xcite",
    ", one achieves nonclassical efficiencies by employing shared quantum states with no entanglement .",
    "a protocol for secure deterministic communication without entanglement was also proposed and experimentally realized  @xcite .    in a bid to understand such phenomena , measures of quantum correlation that are independent of the entanglement - separability paradigm have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "such measures , generally referred to as information - theoretic quantum correlation measures , have been able to provide important successes in understanding these phenomena .",
    "however , there is still a lot of ground that remains to be covered , and moreover , there are intriguing controversies that have been generated  @xcite . this has led us to believe that it is important to identify concepts of quantum shared states that are independent of quantum correlations .    in prospecting for possible physical quantities that lead to nonclassical phenomena by using shared states of quantum systems",
    ", we note that the maximal advantage in most quantum information protocols is achieved for _ pure _ shared states .",
    "pure quantum states , which in general play an important role in quantum mechanics , have vanishing entropy , implying that the full information of the system is available , so that there always exists a measurement strategy for which the system leads to an outcome with unit probability .    for a quantum state of a single system , the fidelity of that state to a pure state , after maximization over all pure states , is the purity of that state .",
    "it gives the maximal born probability that can be obtained in any outcome of any unit - rank quantum measurement on the given state . in case this quantum system ( pure or mixed ) consists of two or more subsystems , and the maximization is still performed over all pure states of the entire system , the maximal fidelity can be referred to as the `` global fidelity '' .",
    "similarly , we introduce a `` local fidelity '' , that measures the maximal born probability which can be obtained in any product state outcome of any unit - rank measurement on the given state .",
    "specifically , the maximization has now to be performed over a suitably chosen set of pure product states .",
    "depending on the set of product states in the maximization , there is a hierarchy of such local fidelities .",
    "`` shared purity '' is the difference between the global and a local fidelity . despite its similarity in form with information - theoretic quantum correlation measures like quantum discord  @xcite and quantum work deficit  @xcite , in that the latter are also differences between two state functions , we will show that shared purity quantifies a property of shared quantum systems that is different from entanglement as well as information - theoretic measures . after introducing the measure",
    ", we discuss its properties and in particular show that for pure states , it reduces to geometric measures of entanglement @xcite . however , for mixed states , it is different from any quantum correlation measure .",
    "we provide analytical closed forms of shared purity for several classes of multiparty mixed quantum states .",
    "we then address the question of monogamy for this measure and prove that the quantity is qualitatively monogamous in that a maximal shared purity between two parties excludes any shared purity of these parties with a third one .",
    "it is to be noted that classical correlations are not monogamous , even qualitatively , and hence the monogamous nature of shared purity ensures the quantumness of the property .",
    "we further show that according to the shared purity , w - class  @xcite states are ( relatively ) more non - monogamous than the greenberger - horne - zeilinger - class ( ghz - class ) states  @xcite , among three qubit pure states .",
    "moreover , we apply the measure to quantify properties of the quantum anisotropic xy spin model .",
    "it has been shown that bipartite as well as multipartite entanglement measures can detect the quantum phase transition present in this model  @xcite .",
    "we show that shared purity is also a faithful detector for identifying the phase transition .",
    "we obtain the finite - size scaling in this model for shared purity , and find it to be different from that for the entanglement measure called concurrence  @xcite , and for the information - theoretic quantum correlation measure called quantum discord @xcite .",

    "the fidelity is a very useful concept in quantum information , or more generally , in quantum mechanics .",
    "it quantifies the closeness of two quantum states , when at least of them is pure .",
    "it can be directly connected to the geometric distances in quantum mechanics like the fubini - study metric  @xcite or the bures metric  @xcite .",
    "we define the `` global fidelity '' of an @xmath0-party arbitrary ( pure or mixed ) quantum state , @xmath1 , on @xmath2 , as @xmath3 where the maximization is performed over all elements ( pure states ) of @xmath4 .",
    "the global fidelity quantifies the minimum distance of an arbitrary multipartite ( pure or mixed ) state from pure quantum states , _",
    "i.e. _ from states with vanishing global entropy .",
    "it measures the lack of disorder present in the system . in case of pure states ,",
    "the minimum is attained by itself and therefore it is unity for all pure states in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "it is also possible to obtain @xmath5 in closed form for arbitrary mixed states .",
    "in particular , we have the following theorem for arbitrary mixed states . +   + * theorem 1 . *",
    "_ for an arbitrary mixed state @xmath1 , @xmath5 is the largest eigenvalue in the spectrum of the state_. + ` proof : ` let us write @xmath1 in spectral decomposition as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 forms an orthonormal basis spanning @xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand , given a basis @xmath7 , any pure state can be written as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are complex numbers , with @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , @xmath11 . let @xmath12 be the largest eigenvalue in the spectral decomposition .",

    "it is therefore interesting to find out how much of the global fidelity can already be attained by using such `` local '' states .",
    "correspondingly , we define the `` local fidelity '' , of the @xmath0-party quantum state @xmath1 as @xmath21 where the maximization is carried out over a certain set @xmath22 , of pure product states . depending on the set of product states , over which the optimization is carried out",
    ", there can be a hierarchy of local fidelities .",
    "there are two extreme cases that we mention explicitly .",
    "one is when the maximization is carried out over the set consisting of the fully separable states , _",

    "the local fidelity optimized over the set , @xmath26 , of states which are not genuinely multiparty entangled will be denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "we now show that @xmath27 can be analytically related to schmidt coefficients in case of pure states . +   + * theorem 2 . *",

    "@xmath20 + the definitions of the global and local fidelities imply that the local fidelity can never surpass in value the global one .",
    "there is therefore a part of the global fidelity that _ may not _ be accounted for by the shared state s lack of disorder as seen by its local parties .",
    "this portion of the global fidelity is therefore present due to the fact that the state is shared , and can be quantified by the difference between the global and local fidelities .",
    "we call the quantity as the `` shared purity '' . depending on the set of product states over which the optimization is carried out in defining the local fidelity , there can be a hierarchy of shared purities .",
    "for example , if the set consists of states which are not genuinely multiparty entangled , then the corresponding shared purity can be called the `` genuine shared purity '' .",
    "we denote it by @xmath34 : @xmath35 on the other hand , if the optimization in the local fidelity is carried out over the set , @xmath24 , of fully separable states , we denote the corresponding shared purity by @xmath36 : @xmath37 let us now discuss some properties of shared purity .",

    "in this section , we will consider the shared purity for nonpure states , and in particular reach the conclusion that shared purity is different from any quantum correlation measures .",

    "the measure is defined for an arbitrary state ( pure or mixed ) of an arbitrary number of parties in arbitrary dimensions . for pure shared states",
    ", the shared purity reduces to the geometric measures of entanglement .",
    "however , for mixed states , the measure is shown to exhibit a drastically different behavior from any measures of quantum correlation .",
    "the measure is a difference between two quantities , which we have called the global and local fidelities .",
    "the global fidelity is shown to be expressible in closed analytic form .",
    "the local fidelity is also calculated analytically for several paradigmatic classes of mixed shared quantum states .",
    "efficient numerical procedures are possible in other cases .    we have shown that the measure is qualitatively monogamous , in that a maximal amount of shared purity between two quantum systems rules out the existence of any shared purity with these systems of any third party .",
    "this is very unlike classical correlations , and ensures the quantum nature of the quantity . like many other measures of entanglement and information - theoretic quantum correlations , shared purity",
    "can be both monogamous and non - monogamous , when quantitatively probed .",
    "we have performed this quantitative analysis for all three - qubit pure states . in particular , we have found that all generalized w states violate the monogamy relation for shared purity while all generalized greenberger - horne - zeilinger states satisfy the same .    finally , we have applied the shared purity to analyze the quantum anisotropic xy spin model and have found that it can faithfully signal the quantum phase transition present in this model .",
    "moreover , we have performed a finite - size scaling analysis , and have obtained the scaling exponent of shared purity in this model .",
    "interestingly , the scaling exponent is different from those of concurrence , an entanglement measure , and quantum discord , an information - theoretic quantum correlation .              c. h. bennett , d. p. divincenzo , c. a. fuchs , t. mor , e. rains , p. w. shor , j. a. smolin , and w. k. wootters , phys .",
