    "observations of the accelerating nature of the universe show that there is fundamental physics at work that we do not understand @xcite .",
    "many possibilities have been postulated including a new form of the vacuum which is not present in the contemporary high energy physics , or a modification of gravity which would revolutionize our understanding of space and time .",
    "discovering which mechanism is correct is one of the key challenges for 21st century science .",
    "the detection of acceleration was obtained by using supernovae as standard candles , and therefore relies on measuring the cosmological geometry .",
    "the physical process causing the acceleration could also affect structure formation , which provides a complementary way of distinguishing between models .",
    "in particular , models in which general relativity is unmodified have different large - scale structure ( hereafter lss ) formation timescales compared with modified gravity ( hereafter mg ) models  @xcite .",
    "because of this , many previous studies have considered testing the signature on lss formation predicted by mg models  @xcite .",
    "direct observations of lss growth as traced by galaxies are of limited value because galaxies are not expected to be simple tracers of the underlying matter density field , although we return to this point later",
    ".    maps of galaxies where distances are measured from spectroscopic redshifts show anisotropic deviations from the true galaxy distribution .",
    "these differences arise because galaxy recession velocities include components from both the hubble flow and peculiar velocities from the motions of galaxies in comoving space .",
    "although these `` redshift - space distortions '' are a nuisance when trying to reconstruct the true distribution of galaxies , they provide a mechanism to measure the build - up of structure , which drives these peculiar velocities on large - scales .    in linear theory , and in the absence of bias , a distant observer should expect a multiplicative enhancement of the overdensity field @xmath4 that is proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is the logarithmic derivative of the linear growth rate , and @xmath6 is the cosine of the angle to the line - of - sight @xcite . with a local linear bias , the real - space galaxy density field is affected , while the peculiar velocity term is not , so the multiplicative factor is changed to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "because of the @xmath6 dependence , this information can be extracted from galaxy redshift surveys , and a number of methods and their application have previously been considered .",
    "analyses have been undertaken using the 2degree - field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite , measuring redshift - space distortions in both the correlation function @xcite and power spectrum after decomposing into an orthonormal basis of spherical harmonics and spherical bessel functions @xcite .",
    "using the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , an eigenmode decomposition has been performed to separate real and redshift - space effects @xcite . in a recent paper , these low redshift analyses were extended to @xmath9 @xcite using the vimos - vlt deep survey ( vvds ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to measuring @xmath10 at @xmath11 , this work has pushed explicitly the idea of using large - scale peculiar velocities for constraining models of cosmic acceleration .",
    "these data , and the resulting cosmological constraints , are considered further in section  [ sec : current ] .",
    "in particular we argue that it would be better to present results in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , rather than @xmath10 for local linear bias models .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : pec_vel_meas ] that bias - independent constraints on @xmath13 are able to discriminate between some models of acceleration as well as @xmath14 , which is commonly extracted from @xmath10 by applying an independent ( and difficult ) measurement of bias .",
    "galaxy bias measurements tend to have the same fractional error as the redshift - spce distortion measurements : for example comparing redshift - space distortion results from the 2dfgrs@xcite with bias measurements from measurements of the 3-pt function@xcite .",
    "in addition to a direct measurement of @xmath13 , redshift - space distortion measurements can be used to test diverse aspects of lss , as proposed by song @xmath15 koyama  @xcite : geometrical perturbations can be reconstructed from the evolution history of peculiar velocities . with the assumption of an additional measurement of galaxy bias , the continuity equation can be tested , and anisotropic stress can be constrained .",
    "those diverse tests strengthen our power to constrain theoretical models , and are considered further in section  [ sec : further_tests ] . before we do this , we first review the physics that we hope to test using peculiar velocities ( section  [ sec : models ] ) , and then consider the measurements themselves and what they can directly tell us about structure formation ( section  [ sec : pec_vel_meas ] ) .",

    "the newtonian force @xmath17 sources the dynamics of the perturbed fluids , while the curvature perturbation @xmath18 measures the local energy density fluctuations . in the epoch of non - relativistic particle domination , in standard gr models , @xmath18 is identical to @xmath19 , and there is no anisotropic stress .",
    "the spatial variation of density fluctuations is expressed by the density contrast @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the specific fluid that we are considering . in the approximation of negligible irrotational flow , the divergence of the peculiar velocity @xmath22",
    ", @xmath23 can be used to describe the fluid motion .",
    "the dynamics of scalar perturbations of the fluid @xmath21 is well described by energy momentum fluctuations @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the corresponding metric perturbations @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the conservation equation @xmath26 gives the set of equations that describe the dynamics of fluid @xmath21 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the equation of state , @xmath29 is the perturbed pressure and @xmath30 is the anisotropic stress .",

    "the cosmic acceleration may arise from a modification of gravity on cosmological scales as in the dgp model @xcite . in this model , we live on the @xmath45dimensional brane which is embedded in an infinite minkowski bulk .",
    "the weakened gravity at cosmological scales induces the cosmic acceleration without introducing dark energy .",
    "the expansion history of dgp model is determined by the usual matter - energy density and the crossover scale defined as the ratio of 5-dimensional to 4-dimensional planck mass scales @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 as an example of dgp models , we take the same @xmath48 and @xmath49 as in our @xmath40cdm model discussed in section  [ sec : de ] , but use a different @xmath50 in order to provide a nearly identical @xmath51 .    in general the equations of motion of linear perturbations in dgp",
    "is not closed without solving the dynamic equation of propagation through the bulk .",
    "but in the quasi static limit @xmath52 , where the contribution of bulk gradient is negligible , the solution can be derived from dynamic equations on the brane . in this regime ,",
    "the perturbed potentials in dgp become modified , @xmath53 where @xmath54 the effective newtonian constant in poisson equation @xmath55 becomes @xmath56 , and a non - trivial anisotropic stress is introduced @xmath57 while there are no changes in the continuity equation and the euler equation  @xcite .",

    ", there is no signature from the coupling in either the continuity equation or the euler equation . for the dark matter",
    ", the coupling influences the dynamics , @xmath70 the continuity equation still holds because the creation / destruction rate of dark matter is proportional to its current density , but the coupling between dark matter and dark energy changes the euler equation .    the interaction between dark matter and dark energy modifies the dynamics of dark matter , so two test particles of baryon and dark matter placed in the same force field will respond differently .",
    "there is no change in the matter continuity equation but , in general , we will measure the velocities of baryonic material , while we observe galaxies in the dark matter potential wells , so measure matter overdensities . the observed continuity equation",

    "if we are able to probe the history of @xmath1 , in addition to @xmath160 , then we can complete the structure formation test .",
    "measuring the derivative of @xmath1 with respect to time would enable us to test the continuity equation by comparing it with @xmath160 .",
    "this test eliminates many different theoretical models explaining cosmic acceleration , and is potentially more powerful than simply measuring only one of these quantities . finally ,",
    "the reconstructed @xmath17 created from @xmath160 can be compared with @xmath18 estimated from @xmath1 , which will constrain the anisotropic stress .",
    "measuring the evolution of @xmath1 is problematic because we can not observe the mass directly .",
    "we could try to predict how galaxies trace the matter ( e.g. @xcite ) , or could measure this bias , for example using higher order statistics ( e.g. @xcite ) . alternatively , we could use weak lensing measurements @xcite .",
    "we expect that these methods will give constraints on bias at the percent level , by the time that redshift - space distortion measurements are obtained from the euclid experiment .",
    "note that the weak - lensing constraints could themselves come from an imaging component of the euclid mission . for our proposed tests that require bias measurements , we therefore assume an expected uncertainty of @xmath161 .",
    "the models used match those described in section  [ sec : mods ] .",
    "if @xmath160 can be measured with sufficient accuracy that its derivative can also be determined , then we can estimate @xmath17 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : euler_x ] ) .",
    "the measured derivative of @xmath162 as a function of redshift can be written @xmath163 where @xmath164 denotes each redshift bin . from this",
    ", we can construct an estimator of @xmath165 from @xmath166 we show estimates of how well future experiments will be able to reconstruct @xmath17 using this method in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lss_test ] . if there is no interaction between dark matter and dark energy , then @xmath167 , since there is no change from the standard euler equation .",
    "this offers a new way to probe the geometrical perturbation other than weak lensing experiment .",
    "even with weak lensing measurements , it is interesting to have @xmath17 separately , because weak lensing probes the combination @xmath168 .",
    "if we can measure the evolution of @xmath169 and @xmath170 simultaneously , then the continuity equation can be tested .",
    "the measured @xmath1 at each redshift bin leads us to estimate its derivative in terms of time , which is defined by , @xmath171 where @xmath164 denotes the number of redshift bin . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lss_test ] , we show the estimated errors in constraining the continuity equation with euclid .",
    "the departure from the continuity equation of cde model having the identical structure formation to dgp model ( dash curve ) is detectable .",
    "it means that mg models can be distinguishable from de type model , i.e. modified gravity is detectable .",
    "the dotted curve representing ide has detectable departure from the continuity equation .",
    "this test will be a crucial future test for exotic de models , but requires either galaxy bias to be fully understood or modelled .",
    "an alternative test using weak - lensing observations is possible .",
    "= 4.5truein = 3.truein      with the same assumption as in the previous subsection of an independent measurement on bias , we can extend the analysis to constrain anisotropic stress .",
    "the curvature perturbations are determined by @xmath172 so a measurement of the normalisation of the density field leads to a constraint on @xmath173 . using this measurement and the measurement in section  [ sec : get_potential ] , we are able to constrain anisotropic stress by comparing reconstructed @xmath174 and @xmath173 .",
    "we show in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lss_test ] , that we are able to constrain the level of anisotropic stress predicted from dgp model .",
    "one of the best ways of measuring this structure growth is to use observations of redshift - space distortions .",
    "this is an interesting and timely subject given current observations and those planned on a 1020 year timescale @xcite . in this paper we have reviewed the importance of redshift - space distortion measurements given that they provide a measurement of structure growth that is independent of galaxy density bias .",
    "we have argued that peculiar velocity measurements are best presented in terms of @xmath170 , or @xmath0 for models where the continuity equation holds .",
    "the independence from galaxy density bias has not been widely covered in previous literature .",
    "most previous analyses have considered measuring @xmath10 and @xmath101 , although there are some exceptions@xcite .",
    "although extremely simple , we have focused on the density bias independent constraint resulting from multiplying these together .",
    "the physical origin of such a constraint is that linear velocities , which scale with the derivative of the growth factor , depend only on the matter velocity field .",
    "the primary conclusion from our work is that constraints on @xmath170 or @xmath0 , are extremely good at helping to distinguish between the dark energy models that we reviewed in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "in fact , as we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : f_v ] , these constraints are equivalent to similar percent measurements of @xmath2 for some models of cosmic acceleration .",
    "they also have the simplicity of not having to model galaxy bias .",
    "the simple formula of @xcite has been adapted to determine constraints on @xmath0 , and shows future constraints in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma8_theta ] . although the @xcite formula is simplistic , and might not be believed at the percent level , it shows that we can expect a huge step forwards in redshift - space distortion measurements with the next generation of surveys .",
    "going beyond simply obtaining a single measurement of @xmath170 or @xmath0 , we have considered how the underlying perturbation evolution can be tested using peculiar velocity measurements .",
    "peculiar velocity measurements are important because they can be used to reconstruct newtonian potential @xmath17 which sources the dynamics of a galaxy given by euler equation .",
    "weak - lensing only measures @xmath17 in the combination @xmath168 , so redshift - space distortions offer a complementary test of perturbations .",
    "we have considered how peculiar velocities can be used to test the continuity equation , which is worthwhile since there are many theoretical models which fail to satisfy this relation . if dark energy couples to matter , then current constraints show that it must couple to the dark matter and not to baryonic material .",
    "the coupling of dark energy to dark matter modifies the euler equation for dark matter , and breaks the equivalence principle between dark matter and baryon .",
    "this difference in free - fall breaks the continuity equation in which the peculiar velocity of matter is estimated using baryons , while we consider the growth of fluctuations in all matter .",
    "in addition , this test can tell if there is dark energy clustering which deepens the curvature potential well because we measure the peculiar velocity of the matter not of the total energy density .",
    "finally we have considered how we can constrain the anisotropic stress by comparing @xmath18 and @xmath17 , reconstructed from the density fields and peculiar velocity respectively .",
