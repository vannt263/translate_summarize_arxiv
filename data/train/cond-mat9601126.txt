    "<S> the system exhibits a transition to an insulating regime with respect to the longitudinal current if the electron density is sufficiently low .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of a uniform magnetic field on energy bands produced by the periodic ( electric ) potential is well known @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of the slightly inhomogeneous magnetic field on the landau levels of a free electron was considered by mller @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he showed that the energy bands exhibit a pronounced asymmetry in the lateral direction . </S>",
    "<S> for a spatially modulated magnetic field a common theoretical model @xcite employs magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the two - dimensional electron gas which has a  carrier \" field @xmath0 with a periodic modulation on top of it : @xmath1 in the work of peeters and vasilopoulos @xcite the effect of a periodic electric and weakly modulated magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) was considered . </S>",
    "<S> they showed that the broadening of the landau levels is roughly proportional to the modulation amplitude @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the  hofstadter - like \" spectrum was obtained by wu and ulloa @xcite , and collective excitations were analyzed in @xcite by the same authors .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we will deal with an electron gas confined to a plane in a perpendicular periodic magnetic field without a  carrier \" field . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , in ( [ eq : period ] ) we take @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the extreme case of the other limit , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> such a periodic field will create an energy band structure of its own . </S>",
    "<S> we see this type of arrangement experimentally realizable by bringing a two - dimensional electron gas in close contact with a mesoscopic longitudinal antiferromagnetic ( sandwich ) structure , without an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> when dealing with the one - electron spectrum it is useful to have some exactly solvable models ( potentials ) , as they elucidate the whole structure of the energy bands @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below we show that the energy bands can be obtained exactly in a simple way for a reasonably idealized periodic magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we present full band picture for both electron with spin and spinless , and discuss the topology of the fermi surface .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for a free spinless electron in a magnetic field is : @xmath6 in our case the electron is confined to a plane , and a periodic magnetic field of lateral antiferromagnet is superimposed . </S>",

    "<S> it is compressed in the ( longitudinal ) @xmath12-direction . as was pointed out in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the pronounced asymmetry along the @xmath11-direction is the signature of the energy spectrum in the inhomogeneuos magnetic field . in the upper quarter of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 is the region where  broad \" bands are formed . </S>",
    "<S> these bands have a finite width in the @xmath12-direction , and the particles occupying these states will have a finite mobility in the longitudinal direction . </S>",
    "<S> the other set of  narrow \" bands occupies the left and right quarters of fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> from the point of view of the kronig - penney model ( [ eq : kronig ] ) they correspond to the valence bands of the periodic potential . </S>",
    "<S> these bands are infinitesimally narrow in the @xmath12-direction , and electrons populating them would have a vanishingly small longitudinal mobility . of course , in the transverse direction states in both types of bands would have some finite mobility . fig .  </S>",

    "<S> as we will see below , the peculiarity of the energy spectrum in a periodic magnetic field will appear in the fact that at the fermi surface both types of states will appear .    in this model </S>",
    "<S> the problem of electrons with spin is equally easy to treat . </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to simply adding the spin - dependent term to the left - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : kronig ] ) : @xmath26       \\chi ( y ) = \\left(e - \\frac{k_x^2}{2 } \\right)\\chi ( y)\\ , ;      \\label{eq : kronig.sp}\\ ] ] which results in a slightly modified dispersion relation : @xmath27 with the same @xmath28 and @xmath29 as in eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> the main structure of the whole spectrum is still represented by the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> as compared to the spinless problem , the  broad \" bands are characterized by wider gaps in the density of states , while  narrow \" bands only slightly change their locations . </S>",
    "<S> as we fill the spin  up \" and  down \" states up to the fermi level , the ground state exhibiting transverse oscillatory spin oscillations in the spirit of the ones discussed by chudnovsky @xcite may result .    </S>",
    "<S> possible fermi surface corresponding to cutting the energy manifold at @xmath30 a.u .  </S>",
    "<S> is presented on fig .  5 . </S>",
    "<S> we show only a part of the first brilloin zone . </S>",
    "<S> shaded areas are populated by electrons . </S>",
    "<S> curved lines of the fermi surface ( in the middle ) correspond to states in the  broad \" bands . as discussed above </S>",
    "<S> , these states have a finite mobility in both directions and will always contribute to the conductivity of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical lines on the extreme right and left correspond to the sections of  narrow \" bands which are flat in the longitudinal direction . thus , these states will not contribute to the longitudinal current , while always contributing to the transverse one . </S>",
    "<S> if the electron gas is dilute enough so that the fermi level drops below the @xmath31 level ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) , the sample will not conduct in the longitudinal direction at all as all the states at the fermi surface will have a vanishing mobility in the @xmath12-direction . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to estimate the electron density for transition to an insulating regime by counting the states with @xmath32 . in our range of parameters </S>",
    "<S> we can totally neglect the width of the  narrow \" bands . </S>",
    "<S> the transition density is given by @xmath33 ( all quantities are in atomic units ) . </S>",
    "<S> the summations are over all @xmath34 for which the radicals remain positive . for our values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath3 , @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> if any of the summations turns out to be restricted to the first  narrow \" band , one has to account for the bandwidth in the @xmath12-direction as well .    in a realistic experimental situation </S>",
    "<S> many - body effects will be present . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest of them is screening . </S>",
    "<S> screening will  smear \" the effective single - particle potential , which may result in suppressing smaller gaps predicted in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> however , these effects do not change the overall structure of the spectrum .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a simple exactly solvable model of the electronic band structure in a spatially periodic magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> all the conclusions derived from the model are not restricted to this particular model , but illustrate the general structure of the energy bands of the two - dimensional electron gas in a periodic lateral magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this type of system can be realized by imposing magnetic field of a longitudinal antiferromagnet on a high - mobility two - dimensional electron gas . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure exhibits a pronounced asymmetry in the lateral direction and consists of the two types of bands . </S>",
    "<S> the states in  broad \" bands will have a finite mobility in the longitudinal direction while the longitudinal mobility of the electrons occupying states in  narrow \" bands is infinitesimally small . </S>",
    "<S> a generic fermi surface will contain both types of states . </S>",
    "<S> if the electron density is sufficiently low , only the  narrow \" bands will be occupied resulting in vanishing of the longitudinal conductivity . the electron density for transition to the insulating regime has been estimated . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting extension of this work is to account for screening in such a system .    </S>",
