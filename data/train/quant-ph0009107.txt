    "non - local quantum correlations or entanglement between space - separated parties is one of the most fertile and thought - generating properties of quantum mechanics .",
    "recently it has become a very useful resource for many of the applications in quantum information theory and this has led to a lot of work devoted to understanding how it can be quantified and manipulated .",
    "bipartite pure state entanglement is almost completely understood , while many questions are still open for the mixed state case . for pure states ,",
    "the schmidt decomposition @xcite has proven to be a very useful tool , since it allows to write any pure state shared by two parties a and b in a canonical form , where all the information about the non - local properties of the state is contained in the positive schmidt coefficients .",
    "the non - local properties of quantum states can be also specified by means of other quantities invariant under the action of local unitary transformations .",
    "an interesting type of these invariants are given by polynomial combination of the coordinates of the state in a product basis , and the relation between these invariants and the schmidt coefficients is well known .",
    "some novel aspects , compared to the bipartite case , appear for entangled systems of more than two parties . in this work we study the canonical forms of three - qubit pure states , extending the results of bipartite systems .",
    "first we analyze the forms proposed for generalizing the schmidt decomposition for three - qubit pure states .",
    "then , we relate one of these decompositions to the polynomial invariants studied in @xcite .",
    "we give a one - to - one correspondence between a canonical form for a three - qubit pure state and a complete set of polynomial invariants describing its entanglement properties .",
    "we also classify the different types of canonical forms by means of the minimal number of local bases product states ( lbps ) , i.e. the minimal number of non - local parameters , needed for the specification of a state . for any three - qubit pure state we give its decomposition with the minimal number of lbps and the procedure that has to be applied in order to build it .",
    "finally we indicate how to generalize the results to systems of @xmath0-qubits , where many difficulties arise .",
    "the schmidt decomposition has been a very useful tool for the study of entanglement properties of bipartite systems . for a generic bipartite pure state @xmath1 it reads [ bischmidt ]",
    "|=_i=1^l _ i|ii , _ i0 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , being @xmath4 orthonormal vectors in each subsystem , and @xmath5 are the schmidt coefficients",
    ". it would be very interesting to find for three - qubit pure states a canonical decomposition generalizing the features of the schmidt decomposition .",
    "however , the trivial generalization is not possible @xcite and it is not evident how to extend the schmidt decomposition to the case of @xmath0-party systems ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "indeed several forms have been proposed ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in recent work",
    "@xcite we gave a generalization of the schmidt decomposition for three - qubit pure states , in the sense that the coefficients of this decomposition carry all the information about the non - local properties of the state , and do so minimally and unambiguously , i.e. the decomposition is not superflous . starting from a generic state shared by three parties , a , b and c , [ state ]"
