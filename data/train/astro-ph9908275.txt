    "emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and some x - ray binaries is thought to result from accretion onto a central massive black hole ( e.g. pringle 1981 ; rees 1984 ) .",
    "this paradigm allows spectra of seyferts to be modelled as a combination of direct emission and reprocessed emission from a cold , optically thick accretion disc ( see reynolds 1999 for a review ) .",
    "the reprocessed component includes the prominent broad iron k@xmath0 flourescence line of rest energy 6.4 kev . since x - rays originate from the innermost regions of the accretion flow , the x - ray emission carries information about geometry and dynamics of the gas very near the black hole .",
    "asca has observed iron lines in 18 seyfert is ( nandra _ et al .",
    "the best studied iron line is that of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( e.g. tanaka _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; iwasawa _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , 1999 ) .",
    "the line profiles observed are consistent with reprocessing of an x - ray illuminated accretion disc under the influence of strong gravity .",
    "iron line profiles for accreting engines around black holes are sensitive to the disc illumination law , the inclination of the disc to the line of sight , the inner and outer radii , and the disc geometry .",
    "( fabian _ et al . _",
    "( 1989 ) ; matt _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) consider the effect of extreme inclination angles ; reynolds and begelman ( 1997 ) discuss the illumination law ) .",
    "most work on reprocessing in agn has considered flat discs , although pariev & bromley ( 1998 ) considered some effects of finite disc thickness , blackman ( 1999 ) considered concave accretion discs , and bachev ( 1999 ) has a non - relativistic treatment of broad line h @xmath1 profiles from warped discs .",
    "there are several motivations for considering iron line profiles from warped accretion discs .",
    "the first is to provide a predictive signature for theoretical models of warping ( e.g. radiative warping ( pringle 1996 ) , tidal warping ( terquem and bertout 1993 ) ) .",
    "observational evidence for warping of discs in agn already includes the water maser emission of ngc 4258 at 0.1pc from the central engine ( on larger scales than the inner accretion disc ) which traces a disc warp ( eg .",
    "_ 1995 ; herrnstein _ et al .",
    "there is also indirect evidence on these larger scales from some observations of seyfert is which suggest that the blrs are not coplanar with the inner disc ( nishiura _ et al .",
    "there have also been suggestions that the dusty tori of seyfert unification paradigms might be warped discs ( maloney 1999 ; phinney 1989 ) .",
    "the second motivation is that some observational features of iron lines directly tempt consideration of non - flat or warped accretion discs with an inclusion of shadowing effects : ( i ) the sharper red than blue fall - off in some seyfert is ( e.g. turner _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) and possibly soft blue fall - offs in seyfert is ( nandra _ et al .",
    "( ii ) profile time variation between observed epochs , including the ` deep minimum'(iwasawa _",
    "_ 1996 , 1999 ; sulentic _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; wijers and pringle 1999 ; weaver and yaqoob 1998 ) .",
    "( iii ) the excessive reprocessed fraction of ultrasoft narrow - line seyferts ( brandt , private communication 1999 ) .",
    "a disc with a concave surface may help with ( iii ) ( blackman 1999 ) , but the other features require shadowing and non - axisymmetric effects . finally , while some agn line profiles such as mcg-6 - 30 - 15 may be quite consistent with flat discs ( iwasawa _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; lee _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , the data at present are somewhat limited and many objects remain to be studied .",
    "consideration of a wider range of plausible disc geometries is necessary so that geometric effects can be disentangled from other effects on the line profiles .    in section 2",
    "we relate two mathematical descriptions of a warped disc .",
    "this facilitates applying various analytic studies of accretion disc warping ( e.g. maloney _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , pringle 1997 ) to the calculation of line profiles .",
    "we then describe ` twisted ' and ` twist - free ' warps ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) for later use .",
    "section 3 gives a detailed procedure for calculating the iron line profile from a general warped accretion disc about a schwarzchild black hole .",
    "this constitutes a substantial generalisation of the currently standard procedure described by fabian _",
    "( 1989 ) for flat discs .",
    "the consideration of shadowing requires ray - tracing of the photon paths in a schwarzchild geometry .",
    "this calculation can be straightforwardly adapted to calculate the iron line profile for any shape of warp .",
    "section 4 begins with a discussion of the values of parameters used , in particular the outer radius and illumination law .",
    "we then give frequency emission maps of a few discs , which illustrate the effects of shadowing and warping .",
    "finally , we comment on a range of line profiles , relating the profile features to the form of the warp and to observed phenomena .",
    "section 5 is the conclusion .",
    "our calculations of emission line profiles are generically applicable to any reprocessing line from a warped disc which is illuminated from above and below .",
    "geometrically thin warped accretion discs can be constucted from a series of concentric rings of increasing radii .",
    "the rings have varying inclination defined by the eulerian angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the angle between the normal to the disc and the normal to the equatorial plane and @xmath5 is the angle of the node with respect to some fixed axis on the equatorial plane . here @xmath6 is the radius of the ring and @xmath7 allows for time dependence of the warp ( for an illustration see bachev 1999 ) .    although this is a conceptually and mathematically useful formalism that emphasises the idea of keplerian orbits about the central object , for flux - related calculations it can be more useful to have the disc described as a surface with height as a function of radius and azimuthal angle from some fixed equatorial axis , @xmath8 .",
    "this cylindrical formalism is also closer to those used for flat discs in flux calculations , so it is easier to appreciate the required generalistations .",
    "such a description of warped discs has been used by terquem & bartout ( 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "the two formalisms described above can be related by the formula @xmath9 \\sin [ \\phi + \\gamma_{eul}(\\sqrt{r^{2}+h^{2}(r,\\phi , t)},t)].\\ ] ] given the difficulty of solving the above for @xmath10 we will employ the approximations @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we consider two specific classes of warp , which are motivated and described below . throughout this paper , distances such as @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "are taken in units of @xmath15 .",
    "negative values of @xmath13 denote a height below the equatorial plane containing the black hole .",
    "the discs are taken to extend from the innermost stable orbit of the schwarzchild solution ( @xmath16 ) to some outer radius @xmath17 , the value of which will be discussed later .",
    "points on the disc thus satisfy @xmath18 note that , for an accretion disc , it is @xmath19 which is bounded , not @xmath14 .",
    "this is necessary to preserve the use of keplerian orbits needed for calculating doppler shifts .",
    "it appears that terquem and bertout ( 1993 ) bound r.    note that we consider here only schwarzchild black holes .",
    "kerr solutions have a smaller inner radius and also a critical radius within which there is no warping , due to the bardeen - peterson effect ; in the presence of a sufficiently visicous accretion disc however , this is critical radius is not particularly large ( kumar & pringle 1985 )",
    ".      this form is given by ( fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 measures the magnitude of the warp and is chosen so that @xmath22 .",
    "we will consider @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 term allows for possible precession with angular frequency @xmath26 , or consideration of discs aligned at different azimuthal angles .",
    "this is mathematically equivalent to changing the azimuthal angle of the observer , but computationally more convenient .",

    "we call the disc of eqn .",
    "( 3 ) twist - free because when it is related to its eulerian angles through ( 1 ) , @xmath5 is independent of @xmath14 so the line of nodes is straight . also , @xmath1 is indepedent of time . within the context of radiative warping models , ( 3 )",
    "is essentially the same form as the generalised ` constant - torque ' solution for certain parameter choices , as described in maloney _",
    "( 1996 ) .    outside of the context of agn",
    ", this form has arisen in warps of t tauri accretion discs ( terquem and bertout 1993 , 1996 ) where it is the stable state under tidally induced warping .",
    "it is also the form of the warp of the galaxy ngc 660 ( arnaboldi and galletta 1992 ) , which has been imaged .",
    "the second form we consider is ( fig .",
    "2 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 allows the absolute magnitude of the warp to be fixed .",
    "we consider @xmath34 and @xmath31 .",
    "this form has arisen in both numerical and analytic calculations of radiatively - induced warping ( for example , pringle 1997 ; maloney _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; wijers and pringle 1999 ) .",
    "again , @xmath26 is the precession frequency .",
    "note that @xmath26 can be negative to give precession in the opposite direction .",
    "we have rescaled the steady state solution in maloney _",
    "( 1996 ) to the dimensions arising in pringle ( 1997 ) so that the first radial zero ( i.e. smallest radius for which @xmath35 ) coincides with the outer radius .",
    "an alternative would have been to use the steady state solution in its initial scaling , which would have produced a multiply peaked disc ( see maloney _",
    "_ 1996 , fig .",
    "2 ) . for the geometry of the warp ,",
    "we have used @xmath36 and @xmath37 , as described above .",
    "these approximations do not significantly change the qualitatitve form of the disc or line profiles .",
    "we consider a hard x - ray point source at a height @xmath38 directly above and below the black hole .",
    "note that for the twisted disc there is a finite tilt at the origin .",
    "the k@xmath0 iron line is produced by reprocessing ( absorbtion and fluorescent emission ) in the disc ( cf .",
    "reynolds 1999 ) .",
    "we define the position of the sources as @xmath39 .",
    "the cartesian coordinate system is the usual cartsian system associated with the cylindrical polars of the disc ( i.e. x - axis at @xmath40 . for the twisted disc @xmath41 define the ( normalised ) position vector @xmath42 ww will use @xmath43 for the actual position vector .",
    "we take the illumination law for flux impinging on an infinitessimal area da of the disc to be @xmath44 where @xmath8 is the vertical height of the disc , with @xmath45 the usual cylindrical coordinates ; @xmath46 is the power law index ; @xmath47 is the first visibility function with value 1 if da is visible to the source under consideration and 0 if da is shadowed .",
    "this is determined using a ray - tracing technique .",
    "@xmath48 will not in general be the same for the upper and lower sources .",
    "finally , @xmath49 is the cosine of the angle between the incident photon and the normal to the disc , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath50 is directed from the disc to the source and that @xmath51 can be the upward or downward normal , as appropriate .",
    "the orientation is defined by sign of the z - component .",
    "we will refer to the disc faces as `` upper '' and `` lower '' respectively . if the dot product of ( 8) and ( 9 ) is negative , then the point is shadowed from the source and there is no contribution to the flux .",
    "this accounts for most of the shadowing but not all , hence the need for the visibility function above .",
    "the formula used above for source flux does not account for the bending of photon paths due to the schwarzchild geometry",
    ". however , this is not a serious problem because ( i ) not much is known about the x - ray illumination law and the general uncertainty swamps any changes that light bending to the disc might cause , and ( ii ) for @xmath54 the effect is not significant ( reynolds and begelman 1998 ) .",
    "we do consider light bending for the reprocessed emission below .",
    "define the normalised vector towards the obsever as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the inclination angle of the observer with respect to the z - axis .",
    "the discs are non - axisymmetric , so this range of @xmath57 must be combined with the full @xmath58 range in azimuthal angle to cover all viewing angles of the disc . we must be careful to allow for the fact that the observer will generally see regions of both the upper and lower sides of the disc .",
    "we now compute the observed flux and energy , generalising formulae from fabian _ et al . _",
    "( 1989 ) to warped geometry .",
    "the geometric approach is close to that in terquem and bertout ( 1993 , 1996 ) . for a flat disc ,",
    "the equations reduce appropriately .",
    "the energy received by the observer is @xmath59 where @xmath60 for the iron line , and @xmath61 at each point on the disc , @xmath62 is defined as the angle between the plane of the keplerian orbit at that point and the photon trajectory plane , defined by the black hole , the emitting point and the direction to the observer .",

    "* figure 3 : * the orbit plane is shown with its defining vectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( not normalised ) .    define @xmath76 as the emission angle on the trajectory plane ( see ( 25 ) and fig .",
    "4 ) , so @xmath77 is the angle between the direction of emission of the photon and the position vector of the point relative to the black hole .",
    "we calculate this by first calculating @xmath78 , the euclidean case , in which the direction of emission is the direction to the observer , so that @xmath79 and @xmath80 we then find @xmath81 from @xmath78 using properties of photon paths near schwarzchild black holes .",
    "these formulae are only strictly correct for @xmath82 ( which is all that is needed for a flat disc )",
    ". however , the symmetry of the emitted photon paths about the plane of the keplerian orbit means we can integrate the paths initially underneath the orbit plane as paths above the orbit plane ( which have @xmath83 in the range required ) , although we have to take this into account when considering shadowing .",
    "we can now write down the expression for the observed flux as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the second visibility function and is 1 if da is visible to the observer and 0 if it is shadowed . in calculating @xmath86 we ray - trace along the bent photon paths .",
    "the vector @xmath87 is @xmath88 rotated by @xmath89 in the photon trajectory plane , and is given by @xmath90 the dot product will always be positive , providing we use the correct normal to the disc .    from any given emission site on the disc ,",
    "the observer can only see flux emitted from either the upper face or the lower face of the disc , because the disc is assumed to be optically thick .",
    "light bending can potentially allow a point to be visible from both faces ; we do not consider this small effect , and similarly , ( 22 ) below , is not corrected .",
    "we determine which face is visible by noting that the upper face will be visible , subject to possible shadowing , if @xmath91 whilst the lower face is visible if the inequality is reversed .",
    "finally , note that we have assumed that the emitted flux is proportional to the incident flux , and so we do not take into account effects due to photoionisation ( cf . reynolds & begelman 1998 ) .",
    "the potential for shadowing to the observer requires that each photon path be checked for possibile intersection with the disc .",
    "we explain this calculation now . in the following @xmath92",
    "are the coordinates of the emitting point on the disc , @xmath93 is the azimuthal angle in the plane of the photon trajectory and @xmath94 is the radial distance in this plane ( see fig .",

    "also shown are several relevant vectors ( note that @xmath64 is not in general parallel to @xmath96 , not shown ) .",
    "the paths are calculated by a numerical integration of the schwarzchild geometry null geodesic equation ( for example , misner , thorne and wheeler 1973 ) ,    @xmath97    with @xmath98 . the integration is done using a fourth order runge - kutta routine .",
    "the coordinates on the trajectory plane are related to the cartesian coordinates of the disc by ( see fig .",
    "4 ) @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "we use this relation in our check for photon path intersection with the disc . here",
    "@xmath64 , @xmath73 and the black hole define the photon trajectory .",
    "this coordinate change is correct for paths above and below the disc .",
    "we must determine the initial conditions for these paths , noting that modifications to angles of emission also affect the flux calculation of the previous section .",
    "the initial conditions are ( note the difference with fabian _ et al._(1989 ) ) @xmath101 here @xmath76 , to be found , must be such that the _ photon path is asympotically parallel to the direction to the observer_. this requires @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the asymptotic angle of the photon path starting with angle @xmath76 and @xmath83 is the angle of the euclidean path to the observer , as in the flux calculation above .",
    "this is solved numerically , with @xmath103 calculated by integrating the differential equation for the trajectory up to a large distance .",
    "it is sufficient to consider @xmath104 for upper side trajectories .",
    "the photon makes no contribution to the flux if its path takes it inside the event horizon ( at @xmath105 ) .",
    "there is a wide range in the values of @xmath17 used in iron line models .",
    "frequently very small values are used ( e.g. tanaka _ et al . _",

    "( 1997 ) use @xmath107 ) . for the illumination laws considered",
    ", the use of a large @xmath17 effectively sets the radial cutoff at infinity for flat discs .",
    "a significant effect of disc curvature is to increase the contribution to the line profile from photons originating from large radii ( blackman 1999 ) , so it can be instructive to consider even larger radii .",

    ".    generally speaking , there are a number of trends highlighted in the line profiles which can be understood by a careful consideration of shadowing , disc curvature , and orientation of the disc with respect to the observer .",
    "consider first the twisted discs , figs .",
    "9 has a slightly flatter warp than fig .",
    "10 , as measured by the different choice of @xmath145 .",
    "line profiles from these discs are very sensitive to the the azimuthal angle @xmath25 .",
    "this is because large regions of the disc are shadowed from the source ( see fig .",
    "the fact that only a small area remains un - shadowed by the source implies a strong deviation in the line profile when compared to the flat disc . in pringle ( 1997 ) , source - shadowing plays an important role in controlling the growth of radiative warping .",
    "let us now focus on fig .",
    "9 , as the trends in fig . 10 are similar .",
    "for all inclinations shown , as we go through the azimuthal cycle starting from @xmath119 ( fig .",
    "9a ) , we see the centroid of the emission shift toward the red and then back toward the blue , commensurate with changes in orientation of the non - shadowed region of the disc with respect to the observer .",
    "the profiles at @xmath129 and @xmath130 are narrowest in figs .",
    "9d - f because the inner region defines the extrema of the observed frequencies ( i.e. the profile width ) and is oriented more face on to the observer at these angles .",
    "the doppler shifts from the inner regions are therefore weaker .",
    "( figs . 2 and 6 may be helpful in this regard . )    the tall peaks in 9c - f come from the regions between @xmath146 and @xmath147 , where the curvature of the disc conspires with the incident flux to produce many photons of coincident observed frequency .",
    "the strong peak at @xmath131 in fig .",
    "10d , e is also due to this effect . while there is some contribution from the outer regions of the disc to these peaks , this not the dominant contribution .",
    "if it were , the peaks in 10h , a , b would be sharper since the outer regions have a more favourable angle to the observer in these boxes .",
    "it is important to distinguish this effect from that discussed in section 4.3 , which leads to even larger peaks near the rest frequency .",
    "notice the presence of line profiles whose asymmetry is qualitatively reversed from the flat disc case . in particular , the soft blue fall - off in 9b - d for the lower inclination angles is not obtainable from flat disc models , which have sharper blue fall - offs for low inclination angles .",
    "( here particularly , it is important to compare plots with the same coordinate aspect ratios . )",
    "this characteristic of flat disc models means that for seyfert is , which are thought to be selected at low inclinations by class , soft blue tails would not be expected .",
    "however , soft blue tails do seem to be present in some line spectra presented in nandra _",
    "this effect can result in our profiles when the inner regions are at a higher inclination angle to the observer than the outer parts of the disc . for steeper inclination angles ,",
    "soft blue fall - offs can be even more proununced when the combination of shadowing and inclination leads to a significant red peak ( fig .",
    "10d , @xmath131 ) .    in the unified scheme of seyferts , flat disc models do not allow edge on views of the innermost regions for seyfert is or face on views for seyfert iis .",
    "twisted discs allow all comibinations , which can therefore produce a wider variety of line profiles , as described above .    generally speaking , twisted discs would either lead to an extremely variable time profile if the warp precession were fast enough , or an extremely wide range of different profiles for different objects .",
    "we are not certain that the present data suggest such a wide range .",
    "therefore , extremely twisted warps do not seem to be indicated by iron line profiles in seyferts .",
    "consider now the twist - free discs , figs .",
    "11 and 12 .",
    "11 employs a warp magnitude @xmath148 and an outer radius of @xmath135 while fig .",
    "12 . employs @xmath149 and an outer radius of @xmath139 .",
    "the curvature index @xmath30 was used in both cases . in general , these discs show less deviation from the flat disc than the twisted disc does because of less severe source - shadowing .",
    "there are a number of other trends in the twist - free case which should be mentioned . in both fig .",
    "11 and 12 , note the change from an initially red - dominated profile at @xmath118 to progressively blue - heavy profiles and then back again . again",
    ", this is consistent with non - axisymmetric source - shadowing .",
    "the large peaks near the rest frequency correspond to seeing the outer regions of the disc .",
    "peaks in fig .",
    "11 are larger than peaks in fig .",
    "12 because even though fig .",
    "12 warps have @xmath149 compared to @xmath148 of fig . 11 , the outer radius is 10 times larger for fig .",
    "11 and the contribution from the increased outer radii is more important .",
    "the largest magnitude of the peak comes in fig .",
    "12 g , where the concavity is at the most directly favourable angle to the observer , maximizing the contributions from the outer regions .",
    "one half of the disc is largely shadowed ; the profiles can then be understood by considering the rotation of the illuminated half of the disc toward and away from the observer as the azimuth cycles , moving from boxes a - h .",
    "the small peak in the @xmath131 discs of fig .",
    "11 , which results in a sharper than usual red fall - off , is also due to greater flux from the outer regions .",
    "the high inclination angle means less observed flux and a smaller peak , but this peak is still much larger than allowed by a flat disc .",
    "this shape at large inclination angle shows resemblance to some line profile observations of seyfert iis ( turner _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , and the agn unification paradigm holds that seyfert iis are indeed inclined at large angles .",
    "such peaks are not present in flat disc modelling .    in figs .",
    "12bcd at @xmath130 and possibly also at @xmath129 , we see a form resembling the `` deep minimum '' of mgc-6 - 30 - 15 which has been modelled by ionization effects ( iwasawa _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . for our case , this shape would be explained by noting that the outer regions are more edge on to the observer than for a flat disc of the same inclination angle , even though the innermost regions are reasonably face on .",
    "weaver & yaqoob ( 1998 ) suggest that the deep minimum may be related to geometric effects .",
    "in particular , they consider occultation by an optically thick cloud .",
    "how this will be resolved remains to be seen , but we note that a natural geometric shadowing due to warping could play some role based on the profiles we find .",
    "note that the large required fraction of reprocesed x - rays required by observations of ultra - soft narrow - line seyfert may aslo be indicative of disc concave - curvature effects , as mentioned in section 1 .      using the the standard shakura - sunaeyev accretion disc viscosity formula @xmath150 where",
    ", h is the disc thickness in units of @xmath151 , @xmath152 is the sound speed , and @xmath153 is the keplerian speed , we can rewrite the radiatively driven disc precession frequency given by maloney _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) as @xmath154 where @xmath0 is the viscosity parameter at the arbitraily chosen fiducial radius @xmath155 , @xmath156 is the accretion efficiency , @xmath157 is the disc height at @xmath155 .",
    "there is significant uncertainty in this value because of the choice of @xmath157 and @xmath155 .",
    "the main purpose of presenting this formula here is to note that significant variation between epochs of observation could have something to do with non - axisymmetric disc effects in addition to whatever may be happening with the state of source activity / flaring ( c.f .",
    "et al . _ 1999 ) .    for x - ray binaries , depending on the choice of @xmath155 , such variations could be as short as @xmath158sec or much longer ( days - month ) again depending on @xmath155 .",
    "the possibility of long periodicities from radiatively driven warps in x - ray binaries was studied by wijers _",
    "x - ray iron lines measured in cyg x-1 ( ebisawa _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) show significant variation in both the line profile and the equivalent width with no binary orbital phase dependence found .",
    "perhaps warped precession could account for a separate periodicity .",
    "also , the observed lines do not seem to show the strong redshifted tail . whilst this may result from the inner regions being more highly ionized , a combination of disc curvature and shadowing may be important ; note e.g. fig .",
    "9a - d in this regard , for the inclination angles of @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "we have developed a method for calculating relativistic line profiles that result from reprocessing of emission by an arbitrarily warped accretion disc orbiting a schwarzchild black hole , and subject to various shadowing effects associated with disc warping .",
    "we have applied the method to calculating a selection of reprocessed x - ray iron line profiles from a point source located above and below the disc .",
    "the essential generalisation from flat disc models is the non - axisymmetry in quantities such as the normal to the disc and the orbit plane of points on the disc , which result from warping .",
    "we have also included shadowing effects both _ by the disc of the source _ , and _ by the disc of the disc _ toward the observer .",
    "we considered two classes of disc warps , twisted and twist - free , distinguished by whether the line of nodes twists or does not twist .",
    "the purpose of our study was two - fold : first , as warped discs are observed on a variety of scales in astrophysics , it is important to develop diagnostics for their presence and predictions for specific warp models .",
    "the iron line profile predictions serve as such a diagnostic for their presence in the central regions of black hole accretion engines .",
    "second , the combination of shadowing effects and non - axisymmetry considerably extends the variety of line profiles which can result from purely geometric and orientation effects , which are potentially important .    for a specific warped disc , there are two angles which determine the observed profile , the inclination angle and the azimuthal viewing angle . for a flat disc ,",
    "all azimuthal viewing angles are equivalent .",
    "time variability of the line profile is expected on the time scale of the warp precession around the disc .",
    "this time scale is determined by the dynamics of particular warp models .",
    "shadowing also changes the equivalent width of the line as a function of azimuthal viewing angle .    aside from the generally increased variety of profiles compared to a flat disc , we note some general trends : ( i ) the relative height of the red and blue parts of the line changes for different azimuthal angles for a fixed inclination angle .",
    "( ii ) red and blue fall - offs can vary significantly for a fixed inclination angle , depending on azimuth .",
    "the shape can either a sharper red cutoff than blue , which is not possibile for a flat disc case , or a sharp blue cutoff as for a flat disc .",
    "( iii ) there can be sharper peaks near the rest frequency compared to a flat disc .",
    "( iv ) twisted warped discs show a larger variability in profiles than twist - free discs due to more substantial source shadowing and also show more extreme deviation from the flat disc profiles .",
    "it seems that although observations do show a wide variety of profiles , the twisted warp profiles seem to be more varied than the observations .",
    "whether this is evidence against twisted warps requires more analysis .",
    "some observed features that we have been able to reproduce qualitatively with warped discs and which may ( or may not ) present some difficulty to standard flat disc models include ( i ) red peaks or steep red fall - offs in some seyfert ii profiles , ( ii ) soft blue fall - offs seen in some seyfert i s ( nandra _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , ( iii ) line profile time variations if the warp precesses at an appropriate frequency , ( iv ) ` deep minima ' states ( iwasawa _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . in this context , weaver & yaqoob ( 1998 ) suggested that occultation ( shadowing ) may play a role in line profiles .",
    "the warp disc shadowing described herein could perhaps play the role of their postulated obscuration . finally , ( v ) misalignmnet of central disc plane with the obscuring torus : in the unified paradigm of seyferts , warped discs would relax the constraints on the predicted profiles that would be otherwise expected from flat disc models .",
    "this means that although seyfert is represent edge on views through the torus , the inner disc could actually be oriented face on , with corresponding line profile effects .",
    "as the data improve , it will be important to distentangle the effects of plauisble non - planar disc geometries with other effects such as ionization fraction changes . exploring a well motivated range of geometric possibilities is important for furthering our understanding of accretion engines .",
