    "arising initially from the debate on the incompleteness of quantum mechanics  @xcite , quantum nonlocality or more correctly speaking , a nonlocal realistic description of nature , is now a valuable resource in many aspects of quantum information science  @xcite .",
    "quantum nonlocality is witnessed by the violation of bell - type inequalities , and these inequalities generally admit local - hidden - variable ( lhv ) models  @xcite , and they arguably provide some of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics .",
    "there have been many investigations on bell - type inequalities for quantum systems of arbitrary parties and dimensions  @xcite .",
    "inequalities involving many - body correlations are important since such correlations dominate the condensed matter of many - body physics . for multipartite systems ,",
    "the issue of quantum nonlocality is rather subtle .",
    "one such subtlety arises naturally within the context of determining if the nonlocality of an @xmath2-qubit system is intrinsically related to genuine @xmath2-qubit correlations , or just simply a convex combinations of nonlocal correlations within subsystems .",
    "another interesting question pertains to whether quantum theory always admits nonlocal features and whether certain subsystems have well - defined properties .",
    "therefore , it is important to carry out tests for many - body scenario and see if it is  immune to any explanation in terms of mechanisms involving fewer bodies \"  @xcite .",
    "genuine multiparitite entanglement is first explored by svetlichny  @xcite in 1987 where he constructed a family of bell - type inequalities , renowned now as svetlichny s inequalities , for a three - qubit system from hybrid local - nonlocal hidden variable models .",
    "violation of such inequalities immediately leads to genuine multipartite nonlocality . in svetlichny",
    "s inequalities , all subsystems necessarily participate , with no single subsystem possessing distinctive well - defined properties .",
    "svetlichny s inequality ( si ) is now widely regarded as a useful tool for detecting genuine three - qubit nonlocality . aside from multipartite scenarios ,",
    "it has also been extensively studied for arbitrarily - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "note that genuine multipartite nonlocality is not the same as genuine multipartite entanglement ( i.e. , full entanglement ) .",
    "the latter describes the mathematical impossibility of separating a quantum state into two parts .",
    "put simply , nonlocality and entanglement serve as differential resources and they are both useful for different applications in quantum information science .    unlike the typical bell - type inequalities ,",
    "there has been less research done on si .",
    "there has been little understanding on si with mixed states .",
    "exploring systems with mixed state is essential since environment - induced noise is in general unavoidable in real experiments .",
    "however , with mixed states , it is generally harder to optimize the use of a quantum resource with respect to a given measure of mixedness or purity .",
    "there are however some interesting examples like _ maximally entangled mixed states _ ( mems ) and _ maximally discordant mixed states _",
    "( mdms ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the borders between nonlocality , entanglement , and mixedness of states are not fully characterized yet .",
    "studies on their differences and their inter - relations may reveal insights for a better understanding of quantum theory and may possibly lead to new quantum information applications .    in this paper , we investigate the mixed states that , with respect to a given amount of purity , possess the maximal quantum violation of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality for two - qubit systems , and of si for three - qubit systems .",
    "such states are shown to be the optimal quantum resource in the context of quantum nonlocal games : the chsh game and svetlichny s game , where the optimal states , compared to any classical strategy , are essential to increase the probability of winning the games .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the general definition of svetlichny game from a family of bell - type inequalities .",
    "we present and discuss the optimal state for the two - qubit chsh game in sec .",
    "furthermore , we show the optimal state for the three - qubit svetlichny s game in sec .",
    "we end the paper with a conclusion in sec . v.",
    "nonlocal games serve as an equivalent way of describing tests for bell - type inequalities@xcite .",
    "we first introduce some formal notations to define svetlichny s game in an @xmath2-party framework .",
    "we also suppose that one referee chooses an @xmath2-bit question @xmath3 uniformly from the complete @xmath2-bit set , where @xmath4 .",
    "he then sends @xmath5 to one group with @xmath6 players and @xmath7 to another with @xmath8 players .",
    "each player @xmath9 must reply with a single bit @xmath10 as an answer to the question @xmath11 .",

    "the winning probability of @xmath2 players is described as @xmath21=\\bigoplus\\limits_{k=1}^na_k\\biggr).\\label{prn1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming that all players do not communicate with each another and that the answer that each player returns is independent of any other players . for a classical strategy",
    ", this implies that the joint probability is separable , and we write @xmath22 , where @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) is the observable of the @xmath25-th qubit .",
    "the winning probability ( [ prn1 ] ) becomes @xmath26 where @xmath27 is just the form of the n - qubit si defined in @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath28 only when the answer @xmath29 satisfies the game criterion for each question @xmath30 , otherwise @xmath31 .    in eq .",
    "( [ prn2 ] ) , the equivalence between the quantum game and the @xmath2-qubit si is straightforward .",
    "note that for given questions @xmath30 and answers @xmath32 , the joint probability @xmath33 has non - zero contributions only from the identity and the full correlation @xmath34 .",
    "the other correlations do not contribute due to the symmetry of the game criterion under permutation of any pair of players .",
    "in fact , the @xmath2-qubit si @xmath35 is a sum of @xmath36 chsh - type inequalities @xmath37 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . this can be understood as follows .",
    "a group of @xmath6 observers is denoted as a single party alice and similarly the other group of @xmath8 observers is denoted as bob .",
    "the measuring results in alice s group are independent of those in bob s , though observers in each group may be nonlocally correlated .    as an example",
    ", the winning probability ( [ prn2 ] ) for @xmath38 can be expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the chsh inequality .",
    "that is , the two - qubit svetlichny s game is just the chsh game . since local realism requires @xmath40 , there is no classical strategy to win the chsh game with probability exceeding @xmath41 .",
    "however , quantum mechanics can beat this bound .",
    "consider the maximally entangled state @xmath42 shared by alice and bob .",
    "there exists a quantum strategy @xcite such that the winning probability reaches @xmath43 , a quantum upper bound now known as tsirelson s bound for the two - qubit system @xcite .",
    "likewise , let us consider the three - qubit svetlichny s game : @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the three - qubit si .",
    "the hybrid local - nonlocal hidden variable models constrain the winning probability to be no more than @xmath47 . however",
    ", the genuine multipartite entanglement and quantum nonlocality can be used to increase the probability .",
    "in fact , considering the ghz state @xmath48 and choosing the proper measurement settings , the maximal amount of @xmath49 in quantum system equals @xmath50 , which leads to that the probability of winning the svetlichny s game can attain @xmath43 . in the following sections , we shall try to explore quantum games with a generic family of optimal states , in particular , the genuine maximally nonlocal mixed states ( mnms ) characterized by maximizing the winning probability in svetlichny s game for a given measure of mixedness of states .",
    "we shall use the linear entropy to quantify the mixedness , then study the maximal winning probability with knowledge of the chsh and svetlichny s inequalities .",
    "the normalized linear entropy is defined as  @xcite @xmath51 with @xmath52 . as an example , let us first consider the mems  @xcite given by @xmath53 with @xmath54 for @xmath55 , and @xmath56 for @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath58 quantifies the concurrence of the state .    because we are interested in the region where @xmath59 can be violated by the state",
    ", we focus on the domain @xmath57 $ ] , in which its linear entropy equals @xmath60 . by choosing the measurement directions in the @xmath61-plane and @xmath62",

    "a relation between @xmath59 and @xmath64 can be found as @xmath65 for @xmath66 $ ] ( see the blue dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we next consider the maximally nonlocal mixed states ( mnms ) . in analogy to the mems which possesses the largest entanglement degree for a given linear entropy",
    ", we define the mnms as a quantum mixed state that possesses the largest quantum violation of the chsh inequality for a given linear entropy , and _ vice versa _ , it is also a quantum state that possesses the largest linear entropy for a given quantum violation of the chsh inequality . in the production of maximally",
    "entangled state , this state describes the output ports from a nonlinear crystal .",
    "one way to obtain the generic form of mnms involves the optimization of the violation of bell - type inequalities . but this method may be very rather involved . instead , we consider a simpler yet rigorous method to find the two - qubit mnms .    in general , a two - qubit state can be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the pauli matrix .",
    "the coefficients @xmath69 constitute a matrix @xmath70 .",
    "the matrix @xmath71 is symmetric , so it can be diagonalized , with @xmath72 . here without loss of generality we have @xmath73 .    for state ( [ state2 ] ) ,",
    "the linear entropy equals @xmath74    our aim here is to find the mnms that maximizes the violation of the chsh inequality for a certain ( [ entropy ] ) . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the maximal violation of the chsh inequality with state ( [ state2 ] ) equals @xmath75 in order to maximize the linear entropy , according to eq.([entropy ] ) , one must minimize @xmath76 .",
    "hence it is reasonable to choose as many of the irrelevant coefficients as possible in ( [ state2 ] ) to be zero .",
    "it is then shown that the violation determined by @xmath77 and @xmath78 are related to @xmath70 .",
    "for simplicity , suppose @xmath79 is diagonal .",
    "hence , the simplest @xmath79 and @xmath70 , except the zero matrix , read @xmath80 therefore , we obtain a matrix @xmath81,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which maximally violates the chsh inequality",
    ".    however , the matrix @xmath82 is not a physically allowed density matrix : the diagonal entries are zero with all nonzero elements of this matrix in the off - diagonal entries . given that @xmath83 must be minimized , in order to make @xmath82 physical , we can simply add just four nonzero coefficients to the diagonal entries of @xmath82 . by denoting these coefficients as @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ,",

( [ positive ] ) lead to @xmath94 .",
    "finally , we obtain the two - qubit mnms @xmath95 this ends the proof .",
    "the form of ( [ mnms2 ] ) may seem somewhat abstract .",
    "however , it is very interesting to note that this mnms can be rewritten into a new form with intuitive physical meaning , i.e. , @xmath96 where @xmath97 $ ] represents a mixture of two orthogonal states @xmath98 , with @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "so the two - qubit mnms can be considered as a imperfect bell state with random spin flipping , where @xmath58 represents a parameter to describe such a flip . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath101 eq .",
    "( [ mnmss ] ) equals the maximally entangled state ; when @xmath102 it becomes a separable state .    for this state , note that the maximum of @xmath59 equals @xmath103 by choosing proper directions , while @xmath104 .",
    "when the mnms is applied to the chsh game , the winning probability reaches @xmath105 , which ranges from @xmath47 to @xmath106 , the latter being the quantum upper bound in the game . in figure",

    ", we note that similar to eq .",
    "( [ state2 ] ) , any three - qubit state , up to local unitary operations , can be expressed in terms of pauli matrices , originally defined in ref .",
    "however , the form of the three - qubit density matrix consists of @xmath110 coefficients , a far more complicated situation than that of a two - qubit state ( [ state2 ] ) .    for a three - qubit state @xmath111",
    ", the average value of si reads @xmath112 the computation of the tsirelson bounds is in general not an obvious task .",
    "however , the task could be somewhat simplified for some particular cases : for instance when the si can be expressed as a sum of chsh - type inequalities  @xcite . in order to obtain the maximum value for the quantum system ,",
    "numerical results show that it is enough to consider measurement settings @xmath113 confined within the @xmath61-plane , i.e. , @xmath114 .",
    "the svetlichny operator @xmath115 is then a matrix with nonzero terms only in off - diagonal entries , i.e. , @xmath116 only depends on off - diagonal terms of @xmath111 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section for two qubits , the problem reduces to finding a genuine mnms that possesses the maximal linear entropy from the set of states with the same violation of si . to this end",

    "maximizing this entropy is equivalent to minimizing the quantity @xmath118 .",

    "( [ opt density11 ] ) is as follows : the anti - diagonal entries can in general be nonvanishing , since with all measurement directions confined within the @xmath61-plane , such entries determine tsirelson s bound of si .",
    "the remaining entries should then be chosen as zeros in order to minimize @xmath143 ; however , a matrix with only nonzero anti - diagonal entries is not a physical state . to get a physical state , diagonal entries with proper values are thus necessary to make the matrix both have a unit trace and being semi - positive definite .",
    "thus , the mnms can be shown to be restricted to an @xmath142-shaped form , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ opt density11 ] ) .    finding the genuine mnms from eq.([opt density11 ] ) is then equivalent to solving an optimization problem of finding a matrix that minimizes @xmath143 ( or maximizes @xmath120 ) for each value of @xmath144 : @xmath145 or that maximizes @xmath144 for each value of @xmath120 : @xmath146    we list the results as follows : @xmath147 , & \\nonumber\\\\ & \\rho_{22}=\\rho_{33}=\\rho_{44}=f \\in[0 , \\frac{1}{8}],&\\\\ & f_1 + 3f=\\frac{1}{2},&\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which leads to the desired three - qubit genuine mnms @xmath148    let us now take a closer look at the results on @xmath149 .",
    "for this state , the following settings @xmath150 can be used to achieve the quantum maximum value for si : @xmath151 note that the genuine mnms equals the standard ghz state at @xmath152 , achieving the maximal violation @xmath50 .",
    "the linear entropy of the genuine mnms equals @xmath153 the quantum maximum value of si can then be rewritten with the linear entropy in its argument : @xmath154 with @xmath155 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for a graphic illustration ) .    obviously , when mnms is applied to three - qubit svetlichny s game , the winning probability ranges from @xmath156 to @xmath157 , similar to the two - qubit mnms case .",
    "a major difference here is that there is a line of maxima for si as the entropy increases between @xmath1 and @xmath158 ( see the green solid line @xmath159 in fig .",

    "( [ maximal violation si1 ] ) and ( [ maximal violation si11 ] ) ) .",
    "the solid line crossing points @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 is the classical bound .",
    "the blue points represent a great number of randomly chosen states.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] +    in fact , the genuine mnms can be understood as a standard ghz state subjected to classical errors , namely , @xmath142-type errors , with each spin undergoing bit flip with equal probability . to be specific , if we first prepare a pure ghz state for a tripartite spin-1/2 system @xmath168 and allow it to undergo a noisy channel such that the computational basis states @xmath169 and @xmath170 are flipped with an equal probability , say @xmath171 , one spin at a time ( or equivalently , two spins at a time ) so that the initial state becomes one of the three flipped states @xmath172 with the same probability .",
    "the resultant state through the channel can then be described by @xmath173 where @xmath98 , yielding nothing but the mnms ( [ opt density ] ) .",
    "it is apparent that such an analysis also applies to the two - qubit case ( [ mnmss ] ) .",
    "the mnms serves as a good approximation of maximally entangled states that undergo classical errors in experimental preparation of states .",
    "we would like to stress that for mnms , the influence of environment on pure quantum states is different from that for the mems , for which nonclassical correlations are quantified in terms of entanglement of formation needed for creating the given state  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the proposed notion of mnms may therefore be more practical than mems in many quantum information processes where classical errors are dominant .",
    "in summary , we have derived the optimal states , the mnms , which provide maximal violation of the chsh and three - qubit svetlichny s inequality for a given mixedness of states .",
    "it has been clearly shown that the mnms is distinct from the mems , in that they give comparatively different curves in the @xmath174 plane .",
    "for the two - qubit system , the upper bound of linear entropy of the mnms can reach @xmath0 , within which the quantum strategy will have a chance to beat its classical counterpart , while for the three - qubit system the value equals @xmath1 and , as a qualitative difference from the two - qubit case , there exists a terrace in the @xmath174 plane for @xmath175 $ ] ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] for comparison ) .",
    "moreover , we have also pointed out that the mnms can be a good representation of maximally entangled states that have undergone @xmath142-type errors , i.e. local spin flips .",
    "we also see that the two - qubit and three - qubit mnms are tolerant against white noise , serving as a valuable resource for quantum information and computation protocols involving bell - type nonlocality , such as quantum nonlocal games , bells - theorem - based quantum cryptography , bells - theorem - based random number generator , etc .",
    "we expect that our method may cast a new perspective for understanding quantum games for general mixed states scenarios .",
    "further questions , like the proofs of mnms for arbitrarily multiple high - dimensional systems , remain an open question and we hope that we can investigate these issues at length in the future .",

    "<S> we study the relation between the maximal violation of svetlichny s inequality and the mixedness of quantum states and obtain the optimal state ( i.e. , maximally nonlocal mixed states , or mnms , for each value of linear entropy ) to beat the clauser - horne - shimony - holt and the svetlichny games . </S>",
    "<S> for the two - qubit and three - qubit mnms , we showed that these states are also the most tolerant state against white noise , and thus serve as valuable quantum resources for such games . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the quantum prediction of the mnms decreases as the linear entropy increases , and then ceases to be nonlocal when the linear entropy reaches the critical points @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the two- and three - qubit cases , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the mnms are related to classical errors in experimental preparation of maximally entangled states . </S>"
