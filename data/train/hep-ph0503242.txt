    "the paper is devoted to description of the running coupling ( the invariant charge ) of qcd in which on the basis of the perturbative study up to four - loop order the attempt has been undertaken to include the nonperturbative contributions in such a way that nonphysical singularities of the perturbation theory in the infrared region be cancelled and the essentials of the qcd dynamics for all energy scales accumulated in its framework .    doing that it seems notably attractive , on the theoretical grounds of the analytic running coupling of qcd , to build the running coupling including additional nonperturbative terms .",
    "we will consider a variation of such couplings , the `` synthetic '' running coupling @xmath10 , which on the practical grounds of the perturbation theory successfully used for description of the region of large @xmath11 ( short distances physics ) , contains the nonperturbative terms , determining the main features of qcd in low @xmath11 region ( long distances physics ) without the dramatic changes of these qualitatively different regimes .    the analytic approach in qft was formulated late in the 50s in refs .   and   for qed and other theories .",

    "their behavior appears to be important in the construction of the synthetic running coupling .    whereas for the one - loop case a separation of the analytic running coupling into the perturbative and the nonperturbative components and behavior of the nonperturbative component are obvious , for the multi - loop analytic running coupling this is not the case .",
