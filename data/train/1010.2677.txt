    "in this paper , we study short - range spin glasses from the point of view of random overlap structures .",

    ", the set of edges such that both endpoints are in @xmath3 will be denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ea model is defined on spin configurations @xmath5 as @xmath6 where the summation is over all nearest - neighbor edges @xmath7 in @xmath4 as well as additional edges at the boundary that endow @xmath3 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "( the choice of boundary conditions will not be important until section  [ subsec : ti ] . )",
    "the set @xmath8 for all edges @xmath7 of @xmath0 are the _ couplings _ of the system .",
    "the definition of the ea model demands that each coupling @xmath9 be distributed independently under a measure on @xmath10 that is symmetric .",
    "the joint distribution of the couplings will be denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the _ gibbs measure _ for the volume @xmath3 at couplings @xmath12 is defined as @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "a fundamental question is of the nature of infinite - volume gibbs measures , i.e. , limits as @xmath15 of measures  .",
    "it is known that for high temperatures they have a simple structure ( in fact there is only one , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , while at low temperatures it could be that there are many `` competing '' states .",
    "a metastate , a measure on infinite - volume gibbs states , is an object used to study these states and will be a main focus of the present paper .",
    "we note that the treatment of the metastate construction in section [ subsec : metastates ] using de finetti s theorem is non - standard and may be of independent interest . because it is a measure on states , the metastate contains information on the correlation functions , local functions of spins , etc .",
    "an alternative viewpoint is to consider only the _ overlaps _ of the system ( here we will look at edge overlaps , but spin overlaps can be considered as well ) .",
    "this is the idea of the random overlap structure ( rost )",
    ". basically , rost s are random matrices whose entries are the overlaps of independent replicas sampled from the gibbs measure .",
    "thus , rost s record by default all information on the diversity and structure of overlaps that is relevant for the thermodynamics .    in this paper",
    "we construct a rost from the ea model s metastate .",
    "this consists of taking the thermodynamic limit of the system before measuring the overlap in an arbitrarily large window .",
    "( similar measures were considered previously by newman & stein and guerra @xcite . )",
    "we show here that the metastate and the rost are very closely related . as an example , we present results about stability properties of the ea rost .",
    "we see that from well - studied translation - invariance properties of the ea model , it follows that its metastate obeys a local stability property .",
    "this in turn implies stochastic stability of the ea rost .",
    "stochastic stability is known to hold for a large class of models with gaussian couplings at almost all @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the proof presented here holds for the ea model at all dimensions , all @xmath16 , and , somewhat unexpectedly , for a wide range of coupling distributions ( including , e.g. , ones that are continuous with support on the real line ) .",
    "this is a main observation of the paper . for completeness ,",
    "an adaptation to the metastate setting of the standard approach to stochastic stability is given in the appendix .    in section  [ subsec : pure states ] we discuss the decomposition of gibbs states in the support of the metastate into pure states and the relation between this decomposition and the representation of the rost on a hilbert space . in particular , we use results of @xcite on the support of a stochastically stable rost s sampling measure to deduce a recent theorem of newman and stein .",
    "it says that no gibbs state in the support of the metastate can have a ( non - trivial ) finite decomposition into pure states .",
    "in other words , each state must be either a combination of two flip - related pure states or infinitely many .    in section  [ sec : sk ]",
    ", we draw comparisons between short - range and mean - field models from the rost perspective .",
    "for example , although the ea model satisfies a local stability condition , the sk model does not due to the scaling of the couplings in the definition of its hamiltonian .",
    "in addition , it is unclear in the ea model if two constructions of overlaps are equivalent : one where overlaps are constructed from a metastate in which the thermodynamic limit is taken before taking the limit of the overlap , and one where overlaps are `` global '' in the sense that both limits are taken simultaneously .",
    "similar issues are raised in @xcite .",
    "it is shown here that in the case of the sk model , permutation invariance of the spins associated to correlation functions leads to equivalence of the two types of constructions .",

    "the existence of a metastate measure on limits of gibbs measure as treated here corresponds to the aizenman - wehr construction @xcite .",
    "however , it is presented in a different way from the standard approach , invoking in particular de finetti s theorem .",
    "the advantage is twofold : it automatically includes a result of newman and stein on sampled replicas using the metastate ( proposition 7.1 of @xcite ) , and it is convenient for the construction of rost s .    let @xmath17 be a finite subset of @xmath0 .",

    "it must be stressed that @xmath39 might not be defined for all @xmath12 , but by conditioning , it must exist for @xmath43-almost all @xmath12 .",

    "it can be proved that the metastate is supported on @xmath44 s that are infinite - volume gibbs measures in the sense of the dlr equations @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , one can see a metastate as the law of the empirical measure of a sequence of spin configurations sampled from a gibbs measure .",
