    "the problem of controlling systems through a limited bandwidth channel has recently raised a great interest in the community , as thoroughly surveyed in @xcite . a possible approach to the problem for continuous - time systems consists of partitioning ( a subset of ) the state space into a finite number of regions and transmitting information whenever the state crosses one of the boundaries .",
    "the resulting system is known as a quantized control system , and the focus of this paper is on this class of systems .",
    "many authors have contributed to the topic , and we refer the interested reader to @xcite for an exhaustive bibliography . among the papers which are important to our derivations we recall @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . + in @xcite , adopting a time - varying quantization , and relying on input - to - state stability of the system , the author shows asymptotic convergence to the origin . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the role of static logarithmic quantization ( @xcite ) to prove practical semi - global stabilizability of nonlinear stabilizable systems has been investigated .",
    "the two papers mainly differ in the type of solution adopted . in particular , the paper @xcite establishes a few connections between quantized control and discontinuous control systems , investigating carathodory and krasowskii solutions in the context of quantized control systems , while the authors of @xcite propose a hysteresis - based implementation of the quantized control .",
    "the two papers also present results which rely on notions of robustness different from input - to - state stability .",
    "finally in @xcite , an adaptive control scheme for nonlinear continuous time uncertain systems is proposed .",
    "+ in this paper , we establish a few results on the problem of stabilizing a nonlinear continuous - time by quantized control robustly with respect to uncertainties . a discontinuous version of the _ semi - global backstepping _ lemma of @xcite , in which the measured state is logarithmically quantized , is applied to show that _ minimum - phase _ nonlinear systems , possibly with _ uncertain parameters _",
    ", can be robustly semi - globally practically stabilized by a quantized function of _ partial - state _ measurements . the control techniques introduced in the papers previously discussed can not be directly applied to the problem considered here , and the resulting quantized control we propose is new to the best of our knowledge . in the scenario",
    "in which the feedback information travels through a finite - bandwidth channel , it is important to calculate the bandwidth needed to implement the quantized controller .",
    "the solution we propose has the additional advantage of allowing us to estimate an upper bound on the required bandwidth .",
    "we also show that semi - global practical stabilization is possible even using a simple _ switched ternary _ controller .",
    "the backstepping lemma of @xcite has played a fundamental role in the design of many robust nonlinear control schemes ( @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude the paper presenting a few examples where the quantized backstepping lemma is used to solve some of these robust nonlinear control problems in the presence of quantization .",

    "furthermore , it is interesting to observe that the constant @xmath85 , that is the number of quantization levels , only depends on the size of the domain of attraction and of the target set .",
    "the stabilization technique examined in the previous section has two main ingredients : the selection of the set of control values , and the switching law which schedules them . as a possible performance measure of the control law",
    "can then be taken the number of times the controller switches to a new value within an interval of time divided by the length of the interval itself .",
    "such a measure is given the name of _ bandwidth _ , because of the obvious implication in the scenario in which the quantized control is fed back to the process through a finite bandwidth communication channel .",
    "the krasowskii solutions considered above do not exclude the possibility to have accumulation of switching points in finite time . to circumvent the possible occurrence of chattering or zeno phenomenon ,",
    "we introduce a modified quantizer following @xcite . the modified quantizer is obtained from ( [ ppsi ] ) to which , for each quantization level , a new one is added , to obtain the following multi - valued map ( see @xcite , figure 3.4 , for a pictorial representation of the map ) : [ ppsi.haya ] _ m(u)= \\ { u_i & u_i & < & u & & u_i , & 0ij + u_i & u_i & < & u & & u_i , & 0ij + 0 & 0 & & u & & u_j & + -_m(-u ) & & & u & < & 0 . & . since the map above is multi - valued , we need to specify the law according to which @xmath121 changes its value as @xmath122 evolves .",

    "this value of @xmath125 identifies a node of the graph .",
    "if the value of @xmath126 fulfills one of the conditions of the edges leaving the node , then a transition is triggered and the quantizer takes the new value  which is denoted by @xmath127  given by the destination node .",
    "for @xmath128 , @xmath121 remains constant until @xmath122 triggers a transition of @xmath121 to the new value , denoted by @xmath129 , again chosen according to the graph of fig .",
    "[ fig.multivalued2 ] .",
    "we refer to @xcite , section 3 , for further details on the switching mechanism .",
    "the first observation is that the result proven in the previous section continues to hold even in the presence of the modified quantizer . as a matter of fact , proposition [ l1 ]",
    "was proven showing that the derivative [ derivative ] ( & ) ( f(x,)+g(x , ) + q(x , , ) -b(x,,)v ) was strictly negative for all @xmath96 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "now , if we adopt the modified quantizer defined above , the closed - loop system becomes the switched system [ sqm ] x & = & f(x,)+g(x , ) + & = & q(x,,)-b(x,,)_m(|k ) , and proving stability of the ( unique ) solution amounts simply to show that ( [ derivative ] ) is still negative when @xmath132 is replaced by @xmath133 .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of the result in the previous section :    [ c1 ] for any @xmath67 , there exist positive numbers @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath49 such that , for any gain @xmath86 and any number of quantization levels @xmath87 , the unique solution @xmath88 of of the system ( [ sqm ] ) , is such that , if @xmath89 , then there exists @xmath90 such that @xmath91 for all @xmath92 .    by definition of @xmath134 and @xmath102 , for each @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",

    "the first fact we recall is the following ( @xcite , @xcite ) :    [ lemma3 ] there exists an @xmath244 matrix @xmath245 and a @xmath246 vector @xmath247 of smooth functions such that @xmath248 is a definite positive and proper function , and the function @xmath249 satisfies @xmath250 , where @xmath251 denotes the derivative of ( [ fff ] ) in closed loop with @xmath252 .    by the change of coordinates @xmath253 , letting as before @xmath254 , it is immediate to see that we are in the setting of proposition [ l1 ] or proposition [ p1 ] , and systems of the form ( [ fff ] ) can be semi - globally practically stabilized by a quantized or ternary controller .",

    "this system is in the form ( [ fff ] ) , and therefore there exists a quantized or a ternary controller depending on @xmath263 for it . the appended dynamics ( [ ad ] ) with @xmath264 given by ( [ ppsi ] ) , ( [ ppsi.haya ] ) or ( [ control.0 ] ) , ( [ control ] ) , and @xmath253 , @xmath265 , is a dynamic output feedback controller which semi - globally practically stabilizes the system ( [ ts ] ) .",

    "the decoder , on the other hand , is a device which carries out the inverse operation with respect to the encoder , and is not depicted for the sake of simplicity . +",
    "compared with @xcite , the solution proposed here does not require a copy of the system to control , and in fact applies to a class of systems which , although less general than the class in @xcite , present model uncertainty .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of the  encoder \" on the sensor side is _ linear _ , and therefore it requires less computational effort than in @xcite . a similar class as ( [ ts ] )",
    "was considered in @xcite , where the output is quantized with no pre - processing . however , in that paper , the control law @xmath264 must be designed so as to guarantee input - to - state stability with respect to state measurements errors , a task which may be considerably harder than designing the control law as in lemma [ lemma3 ] .",
    "observe that we do _ not _ employ a dense quantization , that is we do not require a small quantization error ( the quantization density can be any number in @xmath266 ) to compensate for the lack of input - to - state stability .    [",
