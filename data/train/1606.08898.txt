    "in 1992 , braaten , narison and pich,@xcite and later on le diberder and pich,@xcite culminated a series of previous investigations@xcite@xmath2@xcite on the hadronic decay of the @xmath1 lepton with an analysis which revealed that this decay is a very interesting one for studying qcd .",
    "this led to , in particular , a very competitive determination of @xmath3 ; a determination which has survived until now .",
    "however , today , 24 years later , the increase in precision of the experimental data@xcite and the improved theoretical knowledge@xcite has called for a thorough reinvestigation of this type of analysis , which will be discussed in more detail in section 5 , and to which we will refer as  the old - strategy analysis . \" this reinvestigation of the old - strategy analysis has exposed as two of the main sources of systematic errors the neglect of the contribution from higher - order condensates and the neglect of the contributions from the so - called quark - hadron duality violations(dvs).@xcite as we will discuss below , these two contributions turn out to be related .",
    "dvs refer to the failure of the operator product expansion ( ope ) to properly describe the physics on the minkowski axis and , in particular , to reproduce the spectral functions which are the primary experimental data .",
    "our modification of the old strategy , consisting of a series of papers dealing with several aspects of the analysis,@xcite@xmath2@xcite has culminated in the work of ref .   which has produced , among other things , a new value for @xmath0 .",
    "this is where we currently stand .",
    "a detailed account of this new analysis will be presented in these proceedings by d. boito.@xcite in this article , on the other hand , we will focus on the connection between the contribution from higher - dimension condensates and dvs , and their subsequent impact on the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 spectral functions with @xmath6 quark content , @xmath7 , can be experimentally determined from the ratio @xmath8 } { \\gamma [ \\tau\\rightarrow e\\bar{\\nu}_e \\nu_\\tau ( \\gamma ) ] } } \\ , \\ ] ] as,@xcite @xmath9\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a short - distance electroweak correction and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are polynomials with a double zero at @xmath13 .",
    "this is referred to in the usual jargon as  doubly pinched . \"",
    "as we will see , the use of pinching will be important in the discussion that follows .",
    "the spectral functions @xmath14 are related to the corresponding two - point current correlators @xmath15 as @xmath16 , where the scalar functions @xmath17 are defined as @xmath18 @xmath19 stands for the non - strange @xmath20 or @xmath21 current , @xmath22 or @xmath23 , while the superscripts @xmath24 and @xmath25 label spin . in what follows",
    "we will always take the @xmath26 spin combination because it is free from kinematical singularities .",
    "we are using the notation @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 in the minkowski .",
    "the spectral function @xmath29 is negligible and @xmath30 is dominated by the pion pole , which is known .",
    "the combination @xmath31 may , therefore , be determined directly from @xmath32 .",
    "this provides the primary experimental data the following analysis will be based on , and it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1].@xcite as one can see , even above @xmath33 , the data shows clear oscillations not present in the ope prediction .",
    "the ope prediction , i.e. , perturbation theory plus condensates , in fact , corresponds to a nearly horizontal line with a value of @xmath34 , in clear disagreement with the experimental data .",
    "even though the ope locally disagrees with the spectral data , one expects that at least globally there might be a better agreement .",
    "therefore , one considers finite energy sum rules ( fesrs ) i.e. , integrals of the form @xmath35 valid for any @xmath36 and any weight @xmath37 analytic inside and on the contour represented in fig .",
    "[ fig2].@xcite@xmath2@xcite in the second equality , cauchy s theorem has been used on account of the analytic structure of the correlators @xmath38 , which have a cut on the positive real axis , precisely where the spectral functions are measured . as it stands , eq .",
    "( [ cauchy ] ) is an exact mathematical statement as long as the exact correlator @xmath38 is used .",
    "however , this correlator is not known exactly from qcd . if the scale @xmath39 is deemed",
    " large enough \" ( more about the perils of this assumption in the following ) , it begins to make sense to use of the ope on the contour and write the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cauchy ] ) as @xmath40\\ , \\ ] ] where , by definition , @xmath41 .",
    "it is precisely the term @xmath42 which will be the subject of the following discussion . the superscript ",
    "dv \" stands for _ duality violations _ ( dvs ) and refers to the fact that the correlator computed with the ope in terms of quark and gluon fields does not equal the hadronic counterpart .",
    "apart from the term encoding dvs , eqs .",
    "( [ cauchy ] ) and ( [ cauchydv ] ) yield the necessary relation to determine qcd parameters ( such as @xmath3 , contained in @xmath43 ) , from the experimental data ( contained in @xmath44 ) .    if there were a limit in which @xmath45 as , e.g. , in a convergent expansion , then one would of course have @xmath46 .",
    "however , there is rather compelling evidence that the ope is _ not _ a convergent expansion .",
    "perhaps the simplest way to see this is by considering the ope as an expansion in @xmath47 , i.e. neglecting all the logarithmic corrections . in this case",
    "the ope becomes a power expansion and , as such , its assumed convergence should happen in a full disc in the complex plane around @xmath48 . clearly , the existence of the cut shown in fig .  [ fig2 ]",
    ", running all the way to infinity , contradicts this .",
    "the large-@xmath49 limit also suggests the non - convergence of the ope . in the large-@xmath49",
    "limit the spectral function has poles at arbitrarily high positive @xmath50 ( i.e. , the meson masses ) .",
    "obviously there is no sense in which @xmath50 is  larger than any meson mass \" to make a large-@xmath50 expansion a convergent one .",
    "a somewhat more elaborate argument can also be found in ref .  .",
    "if the ope is not convergent , there is no sense in which @xmath39 may be  large enough \" to guarantee that @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ cauchydv ] ) . in the case of the physical decay of the @xmath1 lepton , the scale @xmath52 .",
    "so , the argument that @xmath53 is a large scale suppressing the contribution of high - dimension condensates in the ope , as has been invoked in the literature in the past , is unreliable .    but not everything is lost .",
    "if the ope is not convergent , the next logical possibility is that it is at least asymptotic .",
    "indeed , asymptotic expansions may have the property of approaching the true function only in an angular sector of the complex plane .",
    "the fact that the ope does a good job describing the correlator in the euclidean ( @xmath54 ) while failing in the minkowski where the cut is located ( @xmath28 ) would suggest this is the case .",
    "this would come at a price , however .",
    "unlike convergent expansions , an asymptotic expansion misses a term relative to the true function .",
    "this missing term is of order @xmath55 for the case of an expansion parameter @xmath56 .",
    "the constant @xmath57 depends on the case considered . in the case of renormalons , for instance , one has @xmath58 and @xmath57 is related to ( the inverse of ) the beta function . therefore , in the case of the ope , since the expansion parameter is @xmath47 , one should expect a correction on the minkowski axis like @xmath59 , for @xmath28 and some unknown parameter @xmath57 .",
    "this is when  pinching \" enters our discussion . if the weight function @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ cauchydv ] ) is chosen with a high - order zero at @xmath60 , the contribution from the contour in the region around the minkowski axis , where @xmath61 has its support , will be suppressed .",
    "pinching , therefore , comes as a potentially useful trick to suppress dvs .",
    "although this may be true qualitatively , at a more quantitative level it is far from clear how much of a suppression one really has for a given order in the pinched polynomial .",
    "this is of course crucial when good control over the systematics is needed in a reliable determination of an important parameter of qcd such as  @xmath3 .",
    "the above discussion leads to the main theoretical message of this article :     _ it is not possible to simultaneously suppress dvs and higher - dimension condensates . _ \"    in other words : pinching comes at a price . indeed ,",
    "a high - order zero at @xmath60 in the polynomial @xmath37 is only achieved when @xmath37 is a high - order polynomial . however , since a term of order @xmath62 selects a condensate of dimension @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ cauchydv ] ) , a high - order polynomial also selects high - order condensates , which are typically either poorly known or unknown .",
    "if the ope were a convergent expansion , this would be a minor problem as higher - dimension condensates would contribute less and less .",
    "this , in fact , has been the main ( explicit or tacit ) assumption in most of the literature so far .",
    "as the ope is expected to be an asymptotic expansion , neglecting higher - dimension condensates becomes a very crude approximation and , at the very least , potentially introduces uncontrolled systematics one should avoid in any case .",
    "up to now , there is no theory of dvs in qcd from first principles .",
    "so , a quantitative analysis of dvs faces serious theoretical challenges and it is no surprise that dvs have been neglected in the old - strategy analysis of hadronic @xmath1 decays .",
    "nevertheless , some progress can be made .",
    "first , a generic property of an asymptotic expansion is that it exactly agrees with the true function only for a vanishing value of the expansion parameter .",
    "this assures that @xmath64 as @xmath65 ( in any direction in the complex plane ) .",
    "then , using cauchy s theorem  in reverse \" by closing the contour at infinity ( which gives a vanishing contribution ) as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , one obtains    @xmath66    the right - hand side of eq .  [ cauchyreverse ] makes explicit two important properties of dvs .",
    "first , the contribution from dv to fesrs involves an extrapolation from @xmath39 to infinity , a region which is not covered by experimental @xmath1 data .",
    "second , recalling that dvs are exponentially damped , one clearly sees why a zero of the weight @xmath37 at @xmath60 , i.e. the lower end of the integration interval , tends to suppress the contribution of the whole integral .",
    "without an explicit representation of dvs it is not possible to go further . we need a concrete parametrization . keeping in mind the expected qualitative behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and the previous discussion , we find it natural to assume@xcite @xmath67 as the ansatz for the contribution of dvs in eq .",
    "( [ cauchyreverse ] ) , for large eonugh @xmath68 .",
    "the exponential damping in @xmath68 stems from the asymptotic property of the ope , as discussed above .",
    "the oscillation is assumed periodic with frequency @xmath69 as inspired by regge theory .",
    "it is clear that the crests seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are due to the different resonances , which would become dirac deltas in the large-@xmath49 limit .",
    "the phenomenological success of regge theory predicting daughter trajectories i.e. , an equal spacing rule for the squares of the resonance masses , suggests a periodic function with a single frequency as a reasonable first approximation .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation is parametrized as @xmath70 just for numerical convenience .",
    "we emphasize that , although the functional form is the same for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the values of the parameters may differ since the two spectra approach the ope result differently .",
    "this adds 4 + 4=8 parameters in total .",
    "let us conclude this section by noting that a parametrization of the form of eq .",
    "( [ dv ] ) can be explicitly shown to be true in a specific model constructed to study dvs in ref .  , and has been applied to determine low - energy constants and condensates in qcd from the @xmath71 correlator by different groups in refs .  - .",
    "the old - strategy method@xcite consists in using five pinched weights @xmath72 , for @xmath73 , with @xmath74 , in the fesrs ( [ cauchy]-[cauchydv ] ) for a _ single _ value of @xmath75 .",
    "we emphasize that these polynomials go up to @xmath76 which , through the fesr ( [ cauchydv ] ) , requires knowledge of the condensates up to dimension 16 .",
    "however , only condensates of dimension @xmath77 and @xmath78 are kept .",
    "condensates of higher dimension , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , are set to zero by fiat .",
    "the argument behind this assumption is that the relevant scale @xmath75 is large enough , and the ope is convergent enough , to make the contribution of these higher order condensates numerically negligible .",
    "however , as we have seen , since the ope is asymptotic this assumption is dangerous . furthermore , dvs are also set to zero on the basis of the above weights being doubly and triply pinched . the danger of employing a high degree of pinching ( and hence a high degree polynomial ) while at the same time neglecting the higher dimension ope contributions introduced by the use of the higher degree polynomial , is precisely the point of our main theoretical message expressed in section 2 . as we will see , although dvs are indeed suppressed for these weights , they are not totally negligible .",
    "in fact , although pinching suppresses dvs , the _ amount _ of this suppression is not necessarily correlated with the amount of pinching _ when a single @xmath39 is employed _ , as in the old - strategy analysis .",
    "that is , e.g. , a triply pinched weight may have a larger dv contribution than a doubly pinched weight when only a single @xmath39 value such as @xmath75 is considered ( see section 7 ) .",
    "given the five moments constructed with the five pinched weights @xmath81 defined above , a fit is performed to extract 4 parameters : the condensates of dimension @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and @xmath0 .",
    "this is a fit with only one degree of freedom .",
    "the results of this fit@xcite reveal an inconsistency in the extracted value of the gluon condensate , where in the @xmath20 channel one has @xmath82 , while in the @xmath83 channel one has @xmath84 , which are incompatible .",
    "clearly the gluon condensate should have come out to be the same .",
    "the @xmath21 channel produces a third incompatible number . although the @xmath20 channel result is the one statistically preferred ( i.e. , a higher p value ) , it is the @xmath83 channel s result which is chosen for the extraction of qcd parameters and , in particular , of @xmath3.@xcite",
    "restricting the analysis to just @xmath75 is dangerous.@xcite with a fixed value of @xmath39 there is no way to determine whether neglected , but in fact non - negligible , higher - dimension condensates contaminate the results .",
    "the parameters will always do  the best they can \" to fit the data at this @xmath39 . because the contribution from different condensates scales differently with @xmath39 , a nontrivial check is then whether these parameters can also describe the data when @xmath39 is lowered by some amount . if the result of the fit deviates from the data as soon as @xmath39",
    "is lowered , this is a clear evidence of contamination by unaccounted for effects .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the comparison of the result of the fit in ref .   and the data for two of the weight functions used in their fit : @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "as one can see , the fit representations deviate from the data as soon as @xmath39 is lowered . for comparison ,",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the same plots but using the results of the fits obtained in ref .  .",
    "the difference is striking .",
    "fig .  [ fig7 ] shows the result of the integral @xmath87 as a function of @xmath39 and the five pinched weights employed in the old - strategy analysis@xcite for the values of the dv parameters found in the analysis of ref .  .",
    "specifically , the parameters used are @xmath88 and @xmath89 , corresponding to the @xmath90 , fopt result of table i in ref .  .",
    "although @xmath91 is only doubly pinched , whereas all the other @xmath81 are triply pinched ( see section 5 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows explicitly how all the triply pinched moments actually produce a _",
    "larger _ contribution to the fesr from dvs than the doubly pinched weight @xmath91 near the value of @xmath92 where the old - strategy analysis is made .",
    "this is of course against the naive belief that more pinching reduces dvs more , and is a consequence of the dv function in eq .",
    "( [ dv ] ) not having a definite sign . on the other hand , when a window in @xmath39 is considered",
    ", one sees in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] how the amplitude of the oscillations for @xmath91 is larger than those for the triply pinched weights , as one would naively have guessed .",
    "so , again , the lesson is that considering a window in @xmath39 is safer than a just a single value , even if this is the largest possible , @xmath75 .",
    "even though neglecting dvs by fiat is not the best way to quantify their effect on @xmath3 , one might be tempted to think that , if the weight is sufficiently pinched and the fesr shows a good match between the fit and the data as @xmath39 is lowered from @xmath93 , the analysis is safe in the sense that systematic effects caused by non - vanishing dvs are numerically negligible , in particular for the @xmath83 channel since the oscillations in the spectrum are smaller there .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the result of a fit to @xmath83 , fopt , for @xmath91 ( i.e. , the same weight as in the decay width ) for @xmath94 , _ without _ dvs .",
    "it is necessary to fit in a window of @xmath39 because the fesr depends on three parameters : @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the optimal fit , with a high p value of @xmath97 , is obtained using the fit window @xmath98 and yields @xmath99 as one can see , the quality of the fit is excellent and it would make nobody suspect that there is a systematic effect lurking in the results .",
    "however , it is there .    to unravel this systematic effect",
    ", one may look at the first weinberg sum rule ( wsr ) for this case .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath100 shown in abscissa is the point up to which the integral in the wsr is taken .",
    "clearly the wsr is violated even at those @xmath39 values for which there is a good match in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . since the v - a spectral function entering the wsr vanishes to a high level of approximation in the ope , the non - zero result in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] is only due to dvs .    to be able to assess in more quantitative terms the systematic effect on @xmath3 which",
    ", after all , is the main objective we are after , one may repeat the fit leading to fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , but now taking as external input the result of the dv parameters obtained in ref .   from the @xmath90 fit of table v , and fitting the ope parameters , @xmath101 and @xmath3 .",
    "the change is dramatic .",
    "the new values obtained are now    @xmath102    instead of eq .",
    "( [ nodvfit ] ) , where the first error is statistical and the second is the one induced by the correlations with the external input dv parameters . as one can see , the condensates even flip sign relative to eq .",
    "( [ nodvfit ] ) , and the value of @xmath103 goes _ down _ by a lot more than the nominal error obtained in the fit ( [ nodvfit ] ) . furthermore , unlike the previous case of the wsr in which dvs were neglected ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) , now the wsr looks like fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , where @xmath100 is the point at which one switches from the spectral data to the dv parametrization in the infinite integration interval of the wsr .",
    "this concludes the exercise .",
    "let us now compare the final results obtained for @xmath3 from @xmath1 decays with and without including the dv parametrization ( [ dv ] ) . with dvs included , we obtain@xcite @xmath104 while the old - strategy method produces a shift of the order @xmath105 higher in @xmath3 at the @xmath1 mass and with errors which are about half those shown in eq .",
    "( [ results]).@xcite the systematic increase in the value of @xmath3 is of course reminiscent of the results found in the exercise of the previous section .",
    "it is sometimes customary to express the result in terms of the @xmath106 ratio in eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) : @xmath107 splitting the qcd contributions into a perturbative term @xmath108 and a nonperturbative term @xmath109 , where @xmath110 are the contributions from the corresponding dimension in the ope and @xmath111 are the dv contributions . in this case",
    "we obtain@xcite @xmath112 to be compared to the value obtained in the old - strategy method , @xmath113,@xcite again with errors which are claimed to be much smaller than those in eq .",
    "( [ deltas ] ) .",
    "since the results of the old - strategy method did not consider dvs and neglected higher - dimension condensates , these errors are to be considered an underestimate .    finally , since perturbative and non - perturbative contributions are strongly correlated ( since their sum has to equal the spectral function integral ) we would like to warn about studies of the perturbative term @xmath108 which use a previous result for @xmath114 as if they were independent of each other .",
    "for any new proposal different from cipt or fopt to reorganize pertubation theory , a new @xmath114 should be obtained from a new fit to the fesrs .",
    "the spectral functions in fig .  [ fig1 ] show visible oscillations which are due to dvs i.e. , terms which go beyond the ope .",
    "dvs , therefore , are not just a question of principle but they also exist in practice . how much dvs impact a determination of @xmath0 can not be answered by neglecting dvs a priori .",
    "pinching may help suppress dvs ( especially if an interval in @xmath39 is used in the analysis ) but one should remember that it is not possible to simultaneously reduce contributions from dvs and the higher - dimension condensates .",
    "so , there is a price to pay .",
    "ignoring dvs and/or the contribution from these higher - dimension condensates introduces an unquantified systematic error that has plagued the old - strategy method.@xcite    on the other hand , the use of a concrete physically motivated parametrization of dvs allows one to perform a complete reanalysis from scratch and quantitatively check the reliability of all the assumptions made in the old - strategy method . doing so has unravelled significant systematic effects , the most important of which is a positive shift in @xmath0 of order @xmath105 when the old strategy is employed .",
    "therefore , any error claimed smaller than @xmath115 in @xmath0 from any previous analysis of hadronic @xmath1 decays neglecting dvs must be considered an underestimate . in order to quantify potential systematic errors a concrete parametrization of dvs for qcd must be assumed .    for our parametrization of dvs in eq .",
    "( [ dv ] ) , since dvs can not yet be derived from qcd from first principles , we have used arguments as general as possible to minimize model dependence . in this sense",
    "it is important to realize that the old - strategy method is not free of model dependence .",
    "this model dependence can be summarized by the following arbitrary choices made there : @xmath116 ( in eq .",
    "( [ dv ] ) ) and @xmath117 , where the @xmath118 s are the corresponding ope condensates .",
    "none of these choices are favored by present data or theoretical knowledge . unlike the case of the old - strategy method , in our case dvs are determined by the data and the analysis passes all known tests up to date , with better performance than the old - strategy analysis .    at this point it is difficult to make progress without a better theoretical understanding of dvs . in this sense , ideas like",
    "resurgence@xcite or functional analysis methods@xcite may be helpful .",
    "it would also help to have more detailed inclusive experimental spectral data , such as the one which could , in principle , be obtained from the babar and belle experiments .",
    "we would like to encourage our experimental colleagues to provide us with this important information in the near future .    * *    after completion of this writeup , a new analysis using the `` old strategy '' appeared.@xcite here we just note that this new analysis fails to answer most of the criticisms of the old strategy raised in sec .",
    "vii of ref .  , and",

    "we also point out that even though ref .   dismisses the use of ansatz ( [ dv ] ) in the determination of @xmath3 from @xmath83 , the authors advocate the use of precisely this type of ansatz in the extraction of low - energy constants and ope condensates from @xmath71 in refs .   and .",

    "<S> we discuss why , in the determination of @xmath0 from hadronic @xmath1 decays , two important assumptions made in most of previous analyses , namely the neglect of higher - dimension condensates and of duality violations ( dvs ) , have introduced uncontrolled systematic errors into this determination . although the use of pinched weights is usually offered as a justification of these assumptions , we explain why it is not possible to simultaneously suppress these two contributions ; particularly since the operator product expansion is expected to be an asymptotic , rather than a convergent expansion . </S>",
    "<S> there is not only experimental and theoretical evidence for dvs , but they also affect the extraction of @xmath0 . </S>"
