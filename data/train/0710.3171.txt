    "control of the false discovery rate ( fdr ) in multiple hypotheses testing has become an attractive approach especially if a large number of hypotheses is at hand .",

    "the first asymptotic investigations concerning expected type i errors of the lsu - procedure , as well as for the corresponding linear step - down ( lsd ) procedure for the independent case , can be found in @xcite  and  @xcite .",
    "a first theoretical comparison of classical stepwise procedures controlling a multiple level @xmath4 [ or familywise error rate ( fwer ) in the strong sense ] based on asymptotics is given in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , attempts to improve the lsu - procedure and interesting investigations based on asymptotics can be found , for example , in and @xcite .",
