    "for decades cepheids and rr  lyrae stars have been considered primary examples of purely radial pulsators .",
    "this simple picture has changed in recent years , when nonradial modes have been detected in substantial fraction of rr  lyrae variables in various stellar systems ( kovcs 2002 ; moskalik & poretti 2003 ; alcock et al .",
    "motivated by these findings , we have undertaken a systematic search for nonradial fpulsators among pop .",
    "i cepheids of the magellanic clouds . in this paper",
    "we present our results for the lmc , with particular emphasis on the new types of pulsation behaviour detected during the survey .",
    "the analysis of the smc cepheids is currently underway and will be presented at a later date .",
    "the primary source of data for our analysis is the ogle - ii photometry obtained with the difference image analysis method ( ebru et al .",
    "this photometry covers the timebase of @xmath1days , with @xmath2 i - band flux measurements per star .",
    "such a long and uniform dataset is particularly well suited for our task .",
    "the search for multiperiodicity is conducted for all lmc cepheids identified by the ogle team ( udalski et al .",
    "1999 ; soszyski et al .",
    "2000 ) , except objects marked in their cataloge as fa , which are mostly pop .",
    "ii variables .",
    "the search is performed with a standard consecutive prewhitening technique .",
    "first , the data is least square fitted with the single frequency fourier sum of the form    @xmath3    with pulsation frequency @xmath4 being also optimised .",
    "the fourier transform of residuals of the fit is then calculated over the range of @xmath5c / d , in order to reveal any secondary periodicities . in the next step ,",
    "a new fourier fit with all frequencies identified so far and _ their linear combinations _ is performed and the fit residuals are searched for additional periodicities again .",
    "the process is repeated , until no new frequencies appear .",
    "the most interesting results of our survey are summarised below .",
    "in two of the previously known fo / so double - mode cepheids a third strong periodicity is detected .",
    "the stars are listed in table 1 .",
    "the period ratio of @xmath6 identifies the new mode as a third radial overtone .",
    "with three radial modes observed , these stars will strongly constrain the cepheids evolutionary tracks .",
    "preliminary calculations show already that both objects are on the first crossing of the instability strip ( dziembowski , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",

    "in 18 out of 55 fo / so double - mode cepheids we detect residual signal in the vicinity of primary pulsation frequencies . with the ogle - ii data , these secondary peaks are always unresolved from the primary ones .",
    "therefore , we repeat the analysis with the macho data ( allsman & axelrod 2001 ) , which is of lower quality , but provides a much longer timebase ( @xmath13day ) . in 8 stars we are now able to resolve the secondary power into two peaks located on opposite sides of the primary ( radial ) peak . together with the primary frequency they form a close _",
    "equidistant triplet_. typical example od such a pattern is displayed in fig.1 .",
    "the triplet structure can appear either around one ( 3 stars ) or around both radial modes ( 5 stars ) . in one object",
    "we detect a triplet and an _ equally spaced quintuplet_. weak evidence of a quintuplet structure is also noticable in two other stars . in all stars amplitudes of the sidepeaks",
    "are below @xmath14 .",
    "the separation of components is always very small and corresponds to the beat period of more than @xmath15day .",
    "when present around both radial modes , the two triplets / quintuplets have _ identical frequency spacings_.    one more star can be resolved with macho data , and instead of triplets we find only doublets . in this particular object the secondary peaks are detected at very low signal - to - noice ratio .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the detected doublets are in fact part of triplets , with the third component being burried in the noise .    the triplet / quintuplet frequency structures discovered in the fo /",
    "so double - mode cepheids can result from excitation of nonradial modes ( nowakowski & dziembowski 2001 ) , but they can also be produced by periodic amplitude and phase modulation of the radial modes .",
    "the latter hypothesis seems to be more likely , as it can naturally explain why the frequency splittings of both radial modes are always the same .",
    "in 46 first overtone cepheids we detect well resolved secondary peaks close to the dominant radial mode .",
    "two examples of such a behaviour are shown in fig.2 . in most stars",
    "only one peak is present , but in several cases two or even three peaks are found , usually on the same side of the primary frequency .",
    "the observed patterns can not be explained by amplitude and/or phase modulation .",
    "the period ratios are _ incompatible _ with those of radial modes , implying that the newly detected periodicities must correspond to _ nonradial modes of oscillation_.    the secondary peaks are always very small .",
    "their amplitudes are @xmath16 times lower than the amplitude of the radial mode . in most cases",
    "nonradial modes are found on the low frequency side of the dominant peak .",
    "the frequency separation @xmath17 is typically between @xmath18c / d and @xmath19 c / d .",
    "this is very similar to @xmath20 range found for the nonradially pulsating rrc stars ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "46 stars in which nonradial modes are detected constitute 10% of the lmc first overtone cepheid sample . in sharp contrast , _ nonradial modes are not found _ in any of the 720 fundamental mode cepheids , with a possible exception of lmc sc17 - 157908 , where marginal detection can be claimed . clearly , the incidence rate on nonradial pulsations is dramatically lower in the fundamental mode variables .",
    "nonradial modes are also found close to the first overtone in two of the fu / fo double - mode cepheids . in both stars , however , secondary peak is only weakly significant and requires confirmation with better data .",
