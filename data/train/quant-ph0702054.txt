    "the effective coupling constant is a combination of the atom - cavity field coupling constant , the amplitude of one of the external lasers and the detuning parameter .",
    "the initial transient regime shows that the system is approximately in an entangled atom - cavity field state , a schrdinger cat state , and we show that the amount of entanglement depends on the steady state mean photon number that is the ratio between the effective coupling constant and the cavity decay rate . in addition , we propose a scheme for monitoring the whole system decoherence based on atomic population measurements .",
    "we find that , for large values of the steady - state mean photon number ( i.e. in the strong coupling regime ) , and for time larger that the inverse of the effective coupling constant , the decoherence behavior can be well approximated by an exponential decay whose rate is given by the effective coupling constant .",
    "+ the cavity field subsystem is always in a mixed state whose photon number distribution is poissonian , while the atomic subsystem can exhibit coherences .",
    "if we measure the atomic state at a given time , we can project the cavity field in a cat - state with sub - poissonian or super - poissonian photon statistics depending on the detected atomic state .",
