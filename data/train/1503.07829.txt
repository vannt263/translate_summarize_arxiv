    "the geometrical - optics ( go ) approximation is widely used to model waves in very diverse contexts , which range from quantum particle dynamics to electromagnetic ( em ) , acoustic , and even gravitational phenomena @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , go is a theory asymptotic with respect to a small parameter , @xmath4 , that is a ratio of the wave relevant characteristic period ( temporal or spatial ) to the inhomogeneity scale of the underlying medium .",
    "absent resonances , just the lowest - order ( `` eikonal '' @xcite , or `` @xmath5 '' ) approximation is applied most commonly , within which a wave exactly matches one of the local eigenmodes at any given location ; then vector waves can be treated exactly like scalar waves @xcite .",
    "however , this @xmath5 model misses important physics when @xmath4 is not vanishingly small or , alternatively , at large enough times . by including the first - order corrections in go",
    ", one finds polarization - driven bending of ray trajectories @xcite , and one can also describe both adiabatic and diabatic mode conversion at resonances @xcite .",
    "these @xmath6-effects were studied extensively in applications to quantum particles and em waves @xcite .",
    "however , the existing theories remain _ ad  hoc _",
    "( e.g.,are restricted to transverse waves in media with no spatial dispersion ) and also can not describe resonant coupling of more than two modes , if at all .",
    "hence , they can not treat many effects that are both relevant and important , particularly those in warm plasmas @xcite .",
    "the existing @xmath6-theories also have not quite unified relativistic quantum and em effects beyond qualitative analogies and simple cases @xcite .",
    "those are long - standing problems @xcite ; however , the recent development of a universal axiomatic description of nondissipative linear waves @xcite makes them potentially solvable .    here",
    ", we develop a general first - principle @xmath6-theory of resonant nondissipative vector waves .",
    "we start with the fundamental representation of the wave lagrangian density ( ld ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) , decompose the field into local eigenmodes , and then simplify the resulting ld by neglecting terms of the second and higher orders in @xmath4 .",
    "the reduced ld that is obtained describes some @xmath1 eigenmodes of the underlying medium , which are coupled through an effective `` gauge hamiltonian '' of order @xmath4 .",
    "we consider waves with frequencies in a narrow enough range , @xmath7 , around the central frequency ; in this case , the gauge hamiltonian can be expressed as a function of coordinates and the central wave vector . as such",
    ", it serves as a generalization of the stern - gerlach ( sg ) hamiltonian that is commonly known for spin-@xmath0 quantum particles .",
    "we then show how to parameterize the ld in order to obtain dynamical equations for continuous go waves and also for their rays .",
    "these equations describe both adiabatic and diabatic mode conversion of all @xmath1 resonant modes simultaneously .",
    "we also show that the dynamics of the @xmath1-dimensional complex polarization vector can be represented as the precession of a real @xmath2-dimensional fixed - length vector , which is interpreted as the wave spin .",
    "( for the special case when @xmath3 , a similar vector has been known as pseudospin , or stokes vector @xcite . )",
    "to illustrate our theory , we also apply it to derive a classical model of a dirac particle , which by itself has been a long - standing and controversial problem ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "we show that our formulation leads to the well known bargmann - michel - telegdi ( bmt ) equations @xcite but with added sg terms , which are typically missed in straightforward semiclassical theories @xcite .",
    "our calculation is the first one that _ formally deduces _ these corrected bmt equations from quantum theory without postulating any quantum - classical correspondence except the go limit .",

    "this part of the presented research also can be considered as a follow - up to our ref .",
    "@xcite , where the correspondence between quantum and classical lds was studied in application to spinless and pauli particles .",
    "overall , the advantages of our new theory are as follows : ( i )  the theory is derived in a variational form , so the resulting equations are manifestly conservative .",
    "( ii )  the theory assumes no specific wave equation ; hence , the equivalence between spin effects in quantum and classical waves is automatically made quantitative .",
    "( iii )  the theory is naturally suited to serve as a stepping stone for studying ponderomotive effects on vector waves , in continuation of the recent ref .",

    "however , in contrast to ours , the latter ( i )  is constructed axiomatically , rather than by deduction , ( ii )  does not capture the sg force ( at least , manifestly ) , ( iii )  is solely a point - particle theory , rather than also a fluid theory , ( iv )  and relies on the concept of proper time , which is introduced _",
    "ad  hoc _ and in a debatable manner @xcite .",
    "also importantly , barut _",
    "et  al _ s theory ( as well as many other classical - spin theories ) is formulated in terms of bispinors , as opposed to spinors .",
    "we believe that this is an unnecessary complication .",
    "a general bispinor describes a superposition of a particle and an antiparticle .",
    "but the slow - envelope approximation generally is not possible for such an object ; then the very concept of a point particle remains undefined .",
    "moreover , a particle and an antiparticle respond very differently to external fields , so they do not travel as a whole .",
    "thus , a point - particle model for them may not be physically meaningful , even when it can be constructed formally @xcite .",
    "our theory avoids this issue by being explicitly restricted to pure ( i.e.,particle _ or _",
    "antiparticle ) states .",
    "then the internal state is described by two rather than four complex numbers , which also simplifies the analysis .",
    "   in application to a dirac particle specifically , the separation of pure states that we used can be interpreted as the foldy - wouthuysen transformation @xcite expanded asymptotically in @xmath4 . in this sense ,",
    "our calculation is also related to that in , e.g.,refs .",
    "@xcite , but with the following difference .",
    "in contrast to other papers , and as we already pointed out in a different context , our theory is constructed straightforwardly by deduction from the quantum ld .",
    "we do not postulate additional symmetries , poisson brackets , or any other correspondence between quantum and classical dynamics except the go limit .",
    "the state function @xmath40 does not need to be related to probability in our formulation @xcite , and thus expectation values do not need to be introduced .",
    "( the same applies to weyl symbols , which fact also simplifies the derivation conceptually . ) in other words , _ our results are formal and do not require an interpretation_.    _ 3 . _",
    "   as a go theory , our formulation is related to the many existing semiclassical theories of dirac particles ( for instance , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but it is different from those theories .",
    "first , typical semiclassical calculations assume @xmath76 to satisfy the zeroth - order hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ eq : shj ] ) and thus do not extend beyond what we call the prescribed-@xmath76 model . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : applic ] , this model is generally inadequate at large times , and that is the reason why standard semiclassical expansions fail to capture the sg force .",
    "a related discussion can be found , for example , in refs .",
    "second , our theory is lagrangian and , as such , leads to manifestly conservative equations .",
    "the lagrangian formulation is also what allows us to introduce a classical theory unambiguously ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and keep the equations manifestly conservative .",
    "moreover , the general theory presented in this paper can be readily reformulated to treat also rapidly oscillating quasiperiodic fields , in which case @xmath54 becomes a ponderomotive potential .",
    "for that , one needs only to replace the assumed eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi0 ] ) for the zeroth - order fundamental matrix , @xmath121 , with a more appropriate expression such as a volkov solution @xcite .",
    "we leave reporting such calculations to future publications .",

    "second , and most importantly , ref .",
    "@xcite is restricted to adiabatic dynamics .",
    "this means that the action is assumed to be conserved in each mode individually , so the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite is inapplicable to systems with degenerate spectrum , including dirac particles . for the same reason ,",
    "the many existing studies @xcite on the berry phase effect in the context of a dirac particle ( and beyond ) are not directly related to the subject of our paper .",
    "nonadiabatic dynamics , which includes mode conversion , was studied , e.g.,in refs .",
    "@xcite , but in the restricted context of an asymptotic scattering problem and only for two - component waves @xcite . in contrast , our theory introduces mode coupling directly in ray equations ( secs .",

    "( the latter and the manifestly lagrangian formulation also distinguish our work from the already mentioned studies @xcite of transverse em waves in relatively simple media . ) this is important , for example , for an adequate description of autoresonant wave - wave interactions @xcite",
