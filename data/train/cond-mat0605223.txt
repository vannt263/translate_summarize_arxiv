    "the density of states is @xmath2 function - like , and the wave function of the particles is localized inside the dot .",

    "_ valence band mixing was included within the eight - band * * k**@xmath3*p * model , coupled via the bir - pikus hamiltonian to the strain of the dot calculated using classical elasticity theory .",
    "very recently , experimental and theoretical results within the single band effective mass approximation including strain were presented in the absence of an external magnetic field , where the dot structure was taken directly from the experiment ( possibly full 3d calculations ) .",
    "the ground state photoluminescence energy of the inas / alas and inas / gaas qds was calculated  @xcite .",
    "gaas / algaas quantum dots can not be created by stranski - krastanov growth because of the almost perfect match of lattice parameters .",
    "nevertheless , this system offers several advantages compared to others : the grown material is ideally unstrained , and sharp interfaces with reduced intermixing can be obtained ; they can be designed to emit light in the optimum spectral range of sensitive si - based detectors .",
    "a new experimental method was presented recently to obtain gaas / algaas quantum dots via multistep ( hierarchical ) self - assembly .",
    "first a template of inas / gaas islands was created , which are `` converted '' into nanoholes on a gaas surface by gaas overgrowth followed by in situ etching .",

    "this allows the electronic properties of the qds to be calculated without the complication of uncertain composition and strain profiles  @xcite .",
    "the gaas qds are characterized by widely tunable emission energy , narrow inhomogeneous broadening ( of the order of 8 - 20 mev depending on the growth parameters ) and large separation between qd emission and continuum ( up to @xmath7200 mev ) .",
    "single - qd spectroscopy on such qds show resolution - limited sharp lines  @xcite , single - photon emission up to 77 k and bright emission up to room temperature  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the calculations are based on a full 3d finite element scheme .",

    "the geometry of the quantum dot was taken directly from scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) measurements .",
    "the profile of the 3d dot is illustrated in fig . 1 .",
    "on top of the gaas dot - well system , an al@xmath8ga@xmath9as barrier was deposited , while on the bottom al@xmath10ga@xmath11as .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to include the coulomb interaction between the electron and the hole in the qd , we calculate the hartree potential @xmath70 by solving the 3d poisson equation :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the particle density , previously calculated from eq .",
    "the potential @xmath73 is the one felt by the hole , _ i.e. _ , in mathematical terms it means @xmath74 . to solve the poisson equation ,",
    "often one uses zero as the boundary condition , which is a good approximation when a large enough grid is used .",
    "the regular asymptotic boundary condition to the poisson equation is proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "note , because the dot profile is not symmetric , consequently the density of the electron is not symmetric , and therefore the exact asymptotic boundary condition for the last equation becomes @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the average value of the coordinates of the electron , and _ q _ is the electron charge .",
    "the coulomb energy , which accounts for the interaction between the electron - hole pair , is obtained by performing 3d integration over the hole coordinates    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the hole density .",
    "note , that by solving the poisson equation we circumvent the direct 6d integration over electron and hole space , and we avoid the 1/r singularity problem for r @xmath24 0 .",
    "the full 3d calculations with the real shape of the dot in the presence of the magnetic field , as well as the poisson equation are performed using the finite element method on a variable size grid .",
    "the input parameters used in the simulations are presented in table i. most of the parameters have been taken from ref .",
    ", otherwise indicated .",
    "in this section we discuss the electron - hole interaction and the wave function extensions of the particles in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "_ one should stress , that there are no fitting parameters in all our calculations_.        the mass of the heavy - hole inside the dot , is equal to 0.35@xmath66 , and is four times larger than the mass of the light - hole 0.09@xmath66 ( see eqs .",
    "( 10a ) , ( 10b ) and table i ) . as a result ,",
    "the wave function radii in the _ xy_-plane of the heavy - hole for zero magnetic field * b * are smaller than for the light - hole , as can be seen from fig .",
    "however , one can notice that the electron extent is smaller than for the light - hole .",
    "the reason is that , although the electron mass is a bit lighter than the one of the light - hole , the conduction band offset is roughly 1.5 times larger than the offset for the light - hole . let us comment on the behavior of the particle radii in the case when the magnetic field is applied along the _",
    "_ z-__direction .",
    "the magnetic field influences the particle motion in the plane perpendicular to the applied direction . when the magnetic field is applied along the _ _",
    "z-__direction ( influence on the _ xy_-plane ) , the 2d radii in the _ xy_-plane are strongly squeezed for all particles ( see full curves in fig .",
    "2 ) , and it leads to a decrease of at least 30 % ( even more for the light - hole ) .",
    "this large change is due to the flatness of the dot , with a lateral dimension about 10 times larger than its height .",
    "this is the reason why the magnetic field applied along the _",
    "x- _ and _ _ y-__directions has a less pronounced effect on the electron and holes 2d extension ( see dashed and dotted curves in fig .",
    "2 , respectively ) .",
    "the dot is slightly larger in the _",
    "_ y-__direction which explains the small difference between the dashed and dotted curves in fig .",
    "radii along the _ _ z-__direction are significantly smaller than those in the plane , as depicted in fig .",
    "3 . the electron radius is smaller than the one for the light - hole , because of the difference of conduction and valence band offsets . when the magnetic field is applied along the _",
    "_ z-__direction , the wave function is squeezed in the plane of the dot , as was already observed , but at the same time it will become elongated in the _ _ z-__direction ( full curves in fig .",
    "3 ) , because the total particle probability is a constant .",
    "this is similar to squeezing a balloon in two directions . in the case of the magnetic field",
    "applied along the _ x- _ and _ _ y-__directions ( dashed and dotted curves in fig .",
    "3 , respectively ) , the particle radii slightly decrease with increasing magnetic field due to the squeezing of the wave function in , respectively , the _ yz- _ and _ xz- _ plane .",
    "the dependence of the electron - hole coulomb interaction on the external magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "4 . as was mentioned in sect .",
    "ii , one can use different boundary conditions for the poisson equation . in the inset of fig .",
    "4 we show that by using the boundary condition described by eq . ( 12 ) and the one with zero boundary conditions may influence the coulomb interaction energy slightly .",
    "the absolute value of the coulomb interaction is inversely proportional to the relative distance between the electron and the hole .",
    "the radii for all the particles in the _ xy_-plane are much larger than that along the",
    "_ _ z-__direction .",
    "therefore , the interaction between the electron and the hole is predominantly determined by the behavior of the particle radii in the _ xy_-plane ( compare figs . 2 , 3 and 4 ) , _ i.e. _ , for the magnetic field applied along the _",
    "_ z-__direction an increase of the absolute value of the coulomb energy for both electron - heavy - hole and electron - light - hole pairs is observed .",
    "only a very small increase with applied magnetic field along the plane of the dot ( see the dashed and dotted curves with circles and squares in fig .",
    "4 ) is seen .",
    "in this section we investigate the exciton diamagnetic shift of the dot .",
    "we perform our simulations for both heavy- and light - hole states and compare them with the experimental data .",
    "the experimental data are obtained by photoluminescence measurements in pulsed magnetic fields up to 50 tesla ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "the experiments were carried out in a he@xmath80-bath cryostat at 4.2 k , using an argon - ion laser at a wavelength of 514 nm to excite the electrons .",
    "the photoluminescence ( pl ) was analysed by a spectrometer and an intensified charged - coupled - device detector , using an integration time of 0.5 ms .",
    "the peak positions of the pl spectrum are obtained by gaussian fits to the experimental spectra .",
    "the measured pl ground state energy versus field dependence can be fitted with an excitonic model , using three parameters : the zero field pl energy , exciton wave function radius and the exciton mass . the exciton radius in the _ _ xy-__plane obtained with the fitting procedure from the experimental data of 7.6 nm is in good agreement with the calculated electron radius as described in the previous section .",
    "a detailed description of the experimental set - up and analysing method can be found in ref .  .",
    "6 we examine the diamagnetic shift of the ground state exciton energy , with and without taking into account the coulomb interaction , when the magnetic field is applied along the _ _ z-__direction . from fig .",
    "6 we can immediately notice the importance of including the coulomb interaction energy ( compare full and dashed curves ) .",
    "the resulting diamagnetic shift is inversely proportional to the reduced mass of the electron and hole .",
    "the heavy - hole mass is four times larger in the _ xy_-plane of the dot than the light - hole .",
    "consequently , the resulting heavy - hole diamagnetic shift is smaller than the light- hole diamagnetic shift , when the magnetic field is applied along the growth direction ( * * b**@xmath81 ) .",
    "up to 35 t the calculated diamagnetic shift energies for the heavy - hole states are in very good agreement with the experimental data . at 50 t",
    "the disagreement between theory and experiment is less than 1 mev .",
    "if we exclude the nonparabolicity of the electron mass the disagreement between the theoretical heavy - hole exciton and the experiment at 50 t is 3 mev . in the inset of fig .",
    "6 we show a contourplot of the electron density which illustrates the asymmetry of the electron density regarding the _ xy_-center .",
    "the zero magnetic field pl energies for the heavy - hole state is e@xmath82=1614 mev , which compares to the experimental pl energy e@xmath83=1620 mev , while for the light - hole we found e@xmath84=1652 mev .",
    "we neglected the zeeman effect in our calculations , since even at the highest magnetic field it gives only a small contribution . taking the g@xmath85-factor for the exciton equal to 0.51  @xcite , the",
    "zeeman splitting energy between the states with the spin up and down is only g@xmath85@xmath86@xmath87b @xmath88 1.5 mev at 50 t , where @xmath86@xmath87 is the bohr magneton .",
    "figure 7(b ) shows the exciton diamagnetic shift of the first excited state in the presence of a magnetic field applied along the _ _ z-__direction . in the experiment ,",
    "the pl intensity of the first , and particulary the second , excited states is quenched with magnetic field , such that experimental data is only available up to 35 and 10 t for the first and second excited states respectively .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that there is an enhancement of the electron - hole wave - function overlap with magnetic field ( not shown ) .",
    "thus , since the intensity of the ground state pl also becomes slightly less intense with magnetic field , this implies that electron - hole pair capture by the dots is suppressed at high fields . theoretically , we investigate both heavy- and light - hole exciton states with and without taking into account the electron - hole interaction . in the whole magnetic field region of available experimental data ,",
    "up to 35 t , we again see a quantitative agreement with the heavy - hole diamagnetic shift when including the coulomb interaction . comparing the pl energies , the heavy - hole state is also closer to the experimental pl energy e@xmath83=1638 mev , e@xmath82=1630 mev and e@xmath84=1673 mev . furthermore , if we compare the heavy - hole pl energy difference between the first excited state and the ground state @xmath89e@xmath90=16 mev with the experimental values @xmath89e@xmath91=18 mev , it gives further support to our claim that the heavy - hole exciton is the ground state . in the inset of fig .",
    "7(b ) we illustrate the electron densities of the first excited state for a magnetic field of 0 and 50 t.    the exciton energy was calculated , as e@xmath92 = e@xmath93 + e@xmath94 - e@xmath95 , where _ i",
    "_ = 0 refers to the ground state , _ i _",
    "= 1 to the first excited state , and so on ; and e@xmath95 is the coulomb interaction between the electron - hole ( heavy- and light - holes ) pair in the _",
    "i_-th state . knowing this exciton energy , we calculate the exciton diamagnetic shift energy @xmath96e@xmath97 .",
    "one should stress , that we assume the recombination between electron and hole of the same quantum state , namely , electron and hole are either both in the ground state or in the first or second excited state , which is experimentally and theoretically justified  @xcite on the basis of selection rules .",
    "moreover , we consider the possibility of multiexcitonic transitions .",
    "let us compare two situations ( 1 ) each particle is in the first excited state ( see the right graph in fig .",
    "7(a ) ) , which corresponds to the first excited state of the exciton , and ( 2 ) the two identical particles ( electron or hole ) with spin up and down are in the ground state and one in the first excited state ( see the left graph in fig .",
    "7(a ) ) , which corresponds to the ground state of the three exciton - line . in the first case we have for the diamagnetic shift for the excited exciton the following terms @xmath89e@xmath98 + @xmath89e@xmath99 - e@xmath100 . in the second case , instead of -e@xmath101 appears 2e@xmath102 + 2e@xmath103 - 2e@xmath104 - 2e@xmath105 - e@xmath100 . here",
    "e@xmath102 is the electron correlation energy of the ground and first excited states , e@xmath103 is the hole correlation energy , and the rest are the coulomb interaction energies between the ground and first excited states of the particles .",
    "we computed the aforementioned correlation and coulomb interaction energies for the heavy - hole state , as an example , in order to estimate the distinction .",
    "however , we found that the difference between the first excited state of the single exciton transition and the ground state of the three exciton - line transition is very small .",
    "it is less than 1 mev at zero magnetic field , and about 1 mev at 50 t. the same situation arises if we compare the ground state of the exciton ( electron and hole are in the ground state ) and the ground state of the two exciton - line ( two electrons and holes are in the ground state ) .",
    "the difference is also less than 1 mev at magnetic field 0 and 50 t.        comparison between our theoretical simulations for the exciton diamagnetic shift of the second excited state and available experimental data are shown in fig .",
    "since there are only experimental data for magnetic fields up to 10 t , it is difficult to judge , whether heavy- or light - hole exciton states are in good agreement with the experiment ( see curves for the heavy - hole and the light - hole with and without coulomb interaction )",
    ". comparing the pl energies , the heavy - hole state is closer to the experimental pl energy e@xmath83=1650 mev , e@xmath82=1644 mev and e@xmath84=1692 mev .",
    "when we compare the heavy - hole pl energy difference between the second excited state and the first excited state with the experimental data , we found that @xmath89e@xmath106=14 mev and @xmath89e@xmath107=12 mev , which is another justification that the experimental results correspond with heavy - hole excitons .",
    "however , for both hole states we observe a negative diamagnetic shift , with increasing magnetic field for b @xmath108 15 t , which agrees with the experimental data ( see open circles ) .",
    "let us remember , that including the magnetic field causes an extra parabolic confinement , as described by eq .",
    "the well known fock - darwin spectrum at small values of the magnetic field , where the 2d harmonic oscillator is considered , shows a small negative dependence of the first excited state energy , which is more pronounced after the crossing of the second and third excited state energies .",
    "however , the negative excitonic diamagnetic shift is seen for the second excited state both in the theoretical and experimental results ( compare figs . 7 and 8) .",
    "in the inset of fig .",
    "8 the change of the electron density for the second excited state for the magnetic fields of 0 and 50 t is plotted .",
    "we also investigate the exciton diamagnetic shift of the qd in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the _ _ z-__direction ( * * b**@xmath109 ) . as an example we consider the exciton diamagnetic shift , when the magnetic field is applied along the _",
    "x- _ , _ _ y-__direction , and directed 45@xmath110 between the _ xy_-direction ( see fig . 9 ) . the coulomb interaction energy , as was already discussed in fig . 4 , has a negligible effect on the magnetic field dependence .",
    "for magnetic fields up to 40 t the experimental points are between the heavy- and light - hole curves , and for high magnetic field a good agreement between the experimental points and the theoretical heavy - hole diamagnetic shift is obtained . within the single band model it is not possible to take into account the coupling between the heavy - hole and the light - hole , which is the most likely reason for the discrepancy at magnetic fields up to 40 t. note , that there is a large distinction in the diamagnetic field between heavy- and light - hole states .",
    "the difference for the magnetic field applied along the _",

    "the inset of fig .",
    "9 shows the heavy - hole exciton diamagnetic shifts ( the light - hole excitons have the same behavior ) for the two lowest excited states .",
    "the dot confinement is more important than the magnetic confinement at small magnetic field .",
