    "the computation of electromagnetic wave propagation in the presence of large , open cavities is an important modeling task .",
    "it is critical , for example , in understanding the effect of exhaust nozzles and engine inlets on aircraft , as well as surface deformations in automobiles and other land - based vehicles  @xcite .",
    "the presence of such structures plays a dominant role in both the near field , where electromagnetic interference is of concern , and in the far field , where the radar cross - section can be used for identification and classification ( including stealth - related calculations ) .",
    "fast and accurate solvers to simulate such scattering phenomena are essential for both design optimization and verification .",
    "a variety of numerical methods have been proposed to solve such scattering problems . largely speaking",
    ", they fall into two categories .",
    "the first is direct numerical simulation using finite difference  @xcite , finite element  @xcite , mode - matching  @xcite and boundary integral methods  @xcite .",
    "the second is asymptotic methods , including gaussian beam approximations  @xcite and physical optics - based schemes  @xcite .",
    "the latter methods tend to work well at very high frequencies in the absence of multiple near - field scattering events , and are generally not well suited for high - precision calculations in geometrically complex environments .",
    "solving the governing maxwell equations using finite difference and finite element methods , on the other hand , requires the discretization of an unbounded domain . in practice , these methods must either employ approximate outgoing boundary conditions to mimic the radiation condition at infinity , or be coupled with a boundary integral representation beyond some distance so that the radiation condition is satisfied exactly . in the present work , we will focus on boundary integral equation methods since they are free from grid - based numerical dispersion , can achieve high - order accuracy in complex geometry , and require degrees of freedom only on the boundary of the scatterer itself , greatly reducing the number of unknowns .",
    "the green s function used to represent the solution satisfies the outgoing ( radiation ) condition exactly .",
    "existing integral representations for cavity problems , however , generally yield integral equations of the first - kind  @xcite .",
    "first - kind equations can lead to ill - conditioned discrete linear systems , especially if substantial mesh refinement is required .",
    "refined meshes may be needed , for example , to resolve geometric singularities .",
    "furthermore , several existing formulations also suffer from _ spurious resonances _ , including those of mixed first-/second - kind systems  @xcite . finally , because of the nature of the dyadic green s function for the electric field , standard methods based on discretizing the physical electric current also suffer from low - frequency breakdown  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is discussed in more detail below .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new representation of the scattered field that leads to a well - posed ( resonance - free ) integral equation which is immune from low - frequency breakdown .",
    "this allows for a stable numerical discretization along arbitrarily adaptive meshes . in our numerical examples , using the the fact that the scatterer ( i.e. the cavity ) is axisymmetric permits us to use separation of variables in cylindrical coordinates , applying the fourier transform in the angular ( azimuthal ) variable .",
    "this procedure leads to a sequence of uncoupled two - dimensional boundary integral equations on the generating curve that defines the cross - section of the boundary of the scatterer ( see fig .  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "there are various numerical technicalities associated with implementing body - of - revolution integral equation solvers , and we do not seek to review the substantial literature here .",
    "we instead refer the reader to  @xcite and the references therein . a concise overview of the discretization and resulting solver is given in section  [ sec_fourier ] .",
    "similar high - order techniques have been applied to solve the helmholtz equation on surfaces of revolution  @xcite and the full maxwell equations ( for closed - cavity resonance problems ) in  @xcite .    due to the applicability of cavity scattering in physics and engineering ,",
    "there has been much work dedicated to both the mathematical and numerical aspects of the problem .",
    "the well - posedness of the ( forward ) scattering problem is discussed in  @xcite in the case of the two - dimensional problem , and in  @xcite for the three - dimensional case .",
    "the paper  @xcite provides the explicit dependence of the scattered field on the wavenumber in the high - frequency context . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors studied uniqueness and stability issues for the inverse problem , where one seeks to recover the shape of an unknown cavity using near - field data .",
    "the corresponding optimal design problem , i.e. to find a cavity shape that minimizes the radar cross section , under certain constraints , is discussed in  @xcite in the two - dimensional setting .",
    "an outline of the paper follows : section  [ sec_form ] provides a detailed introduction to the problem of scattering from an open cavity and proposes an integral representation that leads to a well conditioned integral formulation . in section  [ sec_prof ] , we prove that this integral equation has a unique solution for a given incident field . in section  [ sec_lowfreq ] ,",
    "we show how to avoid low - frequency breakdown merely by the use of various vector identities and physical considerations . in section  [ sec_fourier ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the separation of variables solver for axisymmetric cavities , and then illustrate its accuracy and stability in section  [ sec_numeri ] .",

    "the material parameters are given by @xmath18 , the electric permittivity , and @xmath19 , the magnetic permeability .",

    "this is easy to accomplish by reflection and discussed in more detail in section  [ sec_numeri ] .    before discussing the solution of the cavity problem itself ,",
    "we introduce some necessary notation . given a tangential vector field @xmath33 along some surface @xmath1 , the _ vector potential _ is defined by the single - layer potential @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the green s function for the three - dimensional helmholtz equation @xmath36 it is well known  @xcite that in the case where @xmath37 , a physical electric current , then the corresponding electric and magnetic fields generated by @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 likewise , if @xmath40 , a surface _ magnetic current _",

    "@xmath42 due to the linearity of maxwell s equations , any linear combination of electric current - like variable @xmath33 and magnetic current - like variable @xmath43 will generate a maxwellian field @xmath44 only when @xmath45 does @xmath33 correspond directly to the _ physical _ electric current . in order to develop a well - conditioned integral equation for the cavity problem , we will make use of both potentials and anti - potentials in the representation .",
    "boundary conditions will then determine the values of @xmath33 and @xmath43 .",
    "such an approach is sometimes called the _ indirect - method _ since the unknowns are not the fields themselves .",
    "it is first worth considering the simpler problem where the defect in the half - space boundary is a compactly - supported _ bump _ instead of a cavity ( fig .",
    "[ figure1a ] ) . this problem can be solved using standard integral equations and the method of images .",
    "we need only satisfy boundary condition  , which we write in the form : @xmath46    since , by assumption , @xmath47 away from the bump , we need only satisfy condition   on the bump itself as long as we can construct a representation for @xmath48 that satisfies @xmath49 away from the bump . to this end",

    ", we introduce an artificial boundary @xmath2 that covers the cavity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the boundary @xmath2 must be sufficiently large so that its reflection @xmath3 across the @xmath6-plane does not intersect the cavity .",
    "the domain @xmath59 is now decomposed into two sub - domains .    in a slight abuse of notation",
    ", we will continue to use @xmath9 to denote the _ interior _ domain , bounded by @xmath1 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "we will refer to the upper half - space outside of @xmath9 as the _ exterior _ domain .    in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will denote by @xmath60 and @xmath61 the scattered fields in the interior and exterior domains , respectively .",
    "the exterior scattered field @xmath61 must satisfy maxwell s equations   in @xmath62 , together with the boundary condition @xmath63 and the interface ( or transmission ) conditions on @xmath2 : @xmath64    since the domain @xmath9 contains edges , the fields @xmath65 and @xmath66 in @xmath9 are defined in the sobolev space @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the space of component - wise square - integrable vector fields in @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the resulting integral equations we will derive are consisted by fredholm operators of index zero in the trace space of @xmath69 , for which the fredholm alternative still applies , i.e. uniqueness implies existence . we will omit the proof but refer the reader to  @xcite for a detailed discussion .    as in the case of the bump ,",
    "above , we can ensure that   is satisfied using the method of images .",
    "in particular , we now represent the exterior fields by @xmath70 where image fields are given by @xmath71 the surface currents @xmath72 and @xmath73 on @xmath3 are the images of the currents @xmath38 and @xmath41 on @xmath2 . more specifically , given @xmath74 and its image point @xmath75 ,",
    "the image currents are defined by @xmath76 it is straightforward to verify that   is enforced by symmetry .",
    "note that the last term in the electric field representation in   does not involve an image current .",
    "however , observe that @xmath5 is part of the half - space boundary .",
    "it is easy to check that for any point beyond @xmath2 , sources defined on @xmath5 make no contribution to the tangential electric field on @xmath8 .",
    "[ remark3 ] we have introduced a magnetic current on @xmath5 even though @xmath5 is not part of the boundary of the exterior domain .",
    "this representation leads to a cancellation of hypersingular terms in the integral equation at the triple - junction where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 intersect , and hence to a bounded integral operator .",
    "this technique , which includes layer potentials on _ extra _ boundary components to alter the kernels in the integral equation is sometimes called the _ global density _ technique . for a more detailed discussion ,",
    "see  @xcite .    for the interior scattered fields , we let @xmath77 note that the only difference in the interior representation when compared with the exterior representation is that we have included a contribution from a magnetic current on the cavity  @xmath1 . although @xmath3 , the image surface of @xmath2 , is not part of the boundary of @xmath9 , its contribution is added to the interior scattered fields by the similar reason as in remark [ remark3 ] .    for convenience ,",
    "given two surfaces @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and the current @xmath38 on @xmath78 , we define the following two surface vector potentials for @xmath80 by @xmath81 when @xmath78 has a reflection , we define @xmath82 and @xmath83 to include the contribution from the reflected image currents as well , as in  .",
    "when @xmath84 , the integral operators @xmath85 and @xmath86 become singular .",
    "more precisely , the integral in @xmath87 is hypersingular and defined in the hadamard principal - value sense , while @xmath88 is defined in the cauchy principal - value sense  @xcite . in this case , the following jump relations hold : @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the side that corresponds to the outward ( @xmath91 ) or inward ( @xmath92 ) normal , respectively .    using the previous integral representations for the interior and exterior fields , the boundary value problem @xmath93 along with jump conditions   and  ,",
    "immediately yields a system of integral equations for @xmath38 and @xmath41 : @xmath94 due to the existence of corners , the integral system is not second kind fredholm equation .",
    "nevertheless , the system is well conditioned once the corner singularity is well resolved numerically .",
    "given the magnetic current @xmath41 along @xmath1 , the first three equations the system   are explicitly solvable because they only involve the application of an off - surface layer potential .",
    "therefore , our formulation can be reduced to an unknown magnetic current  @xmath41 along  @xmath1 only .",
    "in particular , by substitition of the first three equations in   into the fourth equation in  , we have the integral equation @xmath95 for @xmath41 along @xmath1 . not only does this observation reduce the number of unknowns significantly",
    ", it will play a key role in avoiding low - frequency breakdown in the electric field , as shown in section  [ sec_lowfreq ] .",
    "since the integral system   consists of fredholm operators of index zero , by the fredholm alternative , existence follows from uniqueness .",
    "this is given by the following theorem .",
    "equation   admits a unique solution @xmath38 and @xmath41 for @xmath96 .",
    "it suffices to show that the system   has only the trivial solution for @xmath96 . for this , let us denote by @xmath97 the region bounded by @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "the proof involves three steps .",
    "first , for @xmath38 and @xmath41 given in  , define the induced electromagnetic field @xmath98 for @xmath99 by @xmath100 and for @xmath101 , @xmath102 from  , we have that @xmath103 and @xmath104 = 0 , \\quad [ { \\mathbf{n}}\\times { \\mathbf{h } } ] = 0 \\quad \\text{on } c_1,\\ ] ] where @xmath105 $ ] denotes the jump in the corresponding the field .",
    "let @xmath106 be a finite region that is bounded by a sufficiently large hemisphere @xmath107 and the surfaces @xmath8 and @xmath2 .",
    "applying green s first vector identity  @xcite to @xmath108 and its complex conjugate @xmath109 in @xmath110 , and recalling the fact that @xmath111 in this region yields @xmath112 similarly , applying the same identity to @xmath108 in @xmath9 , we have @xmath113 note that @xmath27 in   and   denotes the exterior normal with respect to the regions @xmath110 and @xmath9 , and that the right hand side of both relations is purely real ( for real @xmath114 ) . combining   and  , using the continuity condition   along @xmath2 , and taking imaginary parts we have @xmath115 where @xmath116 denotes the imaginary part .",
    "lastly , since @xmath117 on @xmath1 , relation   implies that the electric field is identically zero in @xmath110 by rellich s lemma  @xcite . by analytic continuation from @xmath2 into @xmath9 , we also obtain @xmath118 and @xmath119 in @xmath9 .",

    "we obtain the remaining boundary conditions in  .    the third , and final , step in the proof is to show that the electromagnetic field satisfying   is identically zero . for this , extend @xmath108 and @xmath131 from @xmath97 to @xmath132 by letting @xmath133 it is easy to see that @xmath98 is an electromagnetic field satisfying @xmath134 following the same argument as in the first step ( with @xmath108 and @xmath131 exchanged ) , we must have @xmath124 and @xmath125 in @xmath97 , which implies @xmath135 on @xmath1 . therefore , by  , we obtain @xmath136 and @xmath135 on @xmath2 .",
