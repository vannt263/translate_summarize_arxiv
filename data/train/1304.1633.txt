    "one of the many important roles of interstellar dust in galaxies is the formation of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath0 ) on its surface ( e.g. , gould & salpeter 1963 ; hollenbach & salpeter 1971 ; cazaux & tielens 2002 ) .",
    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) composed of @xmath0 are the major formation sites of stars in galaxies ( e.g. , blitz 1993 ; fukui & kawamura 2010 ) . global star formation rates of galaxies are observed to be well correlated with surface mass densities of interstellar gas ( e.g. , schmidt 1959 ; kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "dust can originate from stellar winds of agb stars ( e.g. , ferrarotti & gail 2006 ; zhukovska et al . 2008 ) and supernovae ( e.g. , kozasa et al . 1991 ; nozawa et al .",
    "2003 ) , and therefore the production rate of dust in a galaxy can be determined by the star formation history that controls the formation rates of agb stars and supernovae .",
    "thus , the evolution processes of dust , gas , and stars are mutually related , and detailed investigation of these coevolution processes can lead us to the better understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "recent observational studies by infrared space telescopes have revealed physical properties of dust , their spatial distributions , and their correlations with their host galaxy properties in nearby and distant galaxies ( e.g. , draine et al .",
    "2007 ; meixner et al .",

    "; takagi et al . 2010 ; dunne et al . 2011 ; kaneda et al . 2011 ; cortese et al . 2012 ; skibba et al . 2012 ; smith et al . 2012 ) .",
    "for example , draine et al . ( 2007 ) have investigated the total dust mass , the mass fraction of the dust contributed by pahs , and the correlation between gas - phase oxygen abundance ( @xmath8=12 + log(o / h ) ) and the dust - to - gas ratio ( @xmath4 ) for 65 nearby galaxies and found that the average pah fraction in galaxies with @xmath16 is 3.55% .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have found a significant difference in the dust - to - stellar - mass ratio between late - type spirals and s0s and thus provided a new clue to the origin of s0s .",
    "meixner et al . ( 2010 ) and skibba et al . (",
    "2012 ) have derived the detailed 2d maps of @xmath4 , dust temperature , and pah fraction in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "recent multi - wavelength observational studies of nearby galaxies have investigated physical correlations between surface densities of star formation ( @xmath17 ) , neutral hydrogen ( h  i ; @xmath18 ) , and @xmath0 ( @xmath11 ) and discussed key parameters that control global star formation in galaxies ( e.g. , bigiel et al . 2008",
    "; leroy et al . 2008 ) .",
    "these observation have also provided data sets for radial gradients of h  i and @xmath0 gas , which are quite useful for discussing what can determine the h  i and @xmath0 gas mass fractions in galaxies .",
    "high - resolution observational studies of gmcs for galaxies in the local group ( e.g. , lmc and m33 ) have provided vital clues to how individual gmcs composed of @xmath0 form from local h  i and how star formation proceeds within gmcs ( e.g. , rosolowsky et al .",
    "2003 ; kawamura et al .",
    "a number of recent observational studies have investigated correlations between properties of dust ( e.g. , @xmath4 and @xmath9 ) and gas ( e.g. , chemical abundances and @xmath11 ) in galaxies ( e.g. , leroy et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "these observational results have raised the following three key questions on the origin of dust and gas in galaxies .",
    "the first is what physical processes are responsible for the observed spatial variation of dust properties within galaxies ( e.g. , radial variation of @xmath4 and pah - dust mass fraction ; meixner et al .",
    "the majority of previous theoretical studies of dust formation and evolution in galaxies are based on one - zone ( or multi - zone ) chemical evolution models ( e.g. , dwek 1998 , d98 ; lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ; hirashita 1999 ; edmunds 2001 ; calura et al .",
    "2008 ; piovan et al . 2011 ) .",
    "although such previous models provided theoretical explanations for a number of key observational results on dust properties in galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath19 relation ) , they did not allow astronomers to discuss the spatial distributions of dust properties and their correlations with other galaxy properties ( e.g. , hubble morphological types ) .",
    "therefore , it is largely unclear in these previous studies what physical mechanisms are responsible for the observed spatial distributions of dust properties in galaxies .",
    "the second question pertains to the determinant factors for @xmath0 properties and their correlations with galaxy properties ( e.g. , luminosities and metallicities ) .",
    "previously , elmegreen ( 1993 ) theoretically discussed the importance of the pressure and radiation field of the interstellar medium in the transition from h to @xmath0 in galaxies .",
    "blitz & rosolowsky ( 2004 ) also investigated the importance of gas pressure in @xmath20 transition based on observational data from nearby 28 galaxies .",
    "recent numerical simulations have incorporated the @xmath0 formation process from h  i ( e.g. , pelupessy et al .",
    "2006 , p06 ; robertson & kravtsov 2008 , rk08 ; gnedin et al . 2009 ; christensen et al . 2012 ) , which means that theoretical studies will soon contribute to the solution of the above problem .",
    "the @xmath0 formation model dependent only on gaseous metallicities and densities proposed by krumholz , mckee & tumlinson ( 2009 , kmt09 ) is practically useful for investigating @xmath0 formation and star formation from @xmath0 in galaxies and thus used in recent semi - analytic models ( e.g. , fu et al . 2010 ; lagos et al .",
    "2012 ) and numerical simulations ( kuhlen et al .",
    "2012 , k12 ) .",
    "however , these recent @xmath0 formation models assume that dust abundances are linearly proportional to metallicities ( i.e. , dust - to - metal ratio , @xmath21 , is constant ) , which is inconsistent with observations ( e.g. , galamex et al .",
    "2011 ) which show a large dispersion in @xmath4 for a given @xmath8 ( i.e. , significantly different @xmath21 ) .",
    "furthermore , such an assumption of constant @xmath21 is incompatible with dust evolution models that predict significant @xmath21 evolution with time in galaxies ( e.g. , inoue 2003 ; calura et al .",
    "thus we need to improve @xmath0 formation models by incorporating dust formation and evolution in order to discuss the second question in a more quantitative manner .    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     in the present study , @xmath1 formation on dust grains and @xmath1 destruction by isrf",
    "are estimated for each sph particle at a given time step by using the smoothing length ( @xmath22 ) and the gravitational softening length ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "for example , we estimate the column density of h  i gas ( which is necessary to estimate @xmath1 formation ) as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is set to be 1 in all models described in the main text .",
    "accordingly we need to demonstrate that the present results do not depend on the resolution of simulations ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "isrf for a gas particle is estimated for the local volume @xmath26 that is defined as ; @xmath27 where @xmath23 is the gravitational softening length for the gas particle and @xmath28 is set to be 1 for all models described in the main text .",
    "such local estimation of isrf implies that stellar radiation from stars that are located outside @xmath23 ( for @xmath29 ) is completely ignored .",
    "although , the radiation density would not change significantly even if a larger volume is used , we need to demonstrate that the present results do not depend on @xmath28 .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have discussed a similar resolution problem related to the estimation of the total amount of radiation from massive stars in their simulations .",
    "also , the present results could possibly depend on the maximum time step width ( @xmath30 ) , though timescales of key physical processes ( e.g. , @xmath31 ) are much longer than the adopted @xmath30 for models described in the main text .",
    "we thus investigate the models in which model parameters are the same as those adopted in the fiducial model except @xmath25 , @xmath28 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the parameter values for these test models ( t1@xmath32t6 as well as the fiducial model ) are summarized in table a1 .",
    "key results on the time evolution of @xmath4 and @xmath6 , which are shown in fig .",
    "a1 , are summarized as follows .",
    "first , the time evolution and final values of @xmath4 and @xmath6 do not depend on @xmath25 for @xmath33 .",
    "this result means that the present results are insensitive to the method to estimate column densities of neutral and molecular hydrogen .",
    "second , the final @xmath6 value in the model with @xmath34 myr ( a finer time step width ) is 34% larger than that in the fiducial model , though there are no significant differences in @xmath4 between the two .",
    "the final @xmath6 in the model with @xmath35 myr is 25% smaller than that in the fiducial model .",
    "gas densities can become higher in the model with smaller @xmath30 so that the probability of conversion from neutral to molecular hydrogen can become higher . as a result of this",
    ", @xmath6 can become larger .",
    "the derived dependences of @xmath6 on @xmath30 imply that @xmath6 can be better predicted by using models with smaller @xmath30 .",
    "however , a larger amount of calculation time is required for completing numerical simulations with smaller @xmath30 .",
    "thus , if one has a limited amount of allocated time for performing numerical simulations ( on gpu clusters or supercomputers ) , one would need to compromise on the accuracy of the predicted @xmath6 .",
    "a1 also shows that the final @xmath6 and @xmath4 do not depend so strongly on @xmath28 : @xmath6 is slightly higher in the models with larger @xmath28 , probably because isrf ( i.e. , radiation density ) can be somewhat weaker for a larger volume ( i.e. , more efficient @xmath6 formation due to weaker isrf ) .",
    "these results imply that the present results are not so sensitive to the adopted method to estimate isrf ( i.e. , non - inclusion of the contribution of distant stellar particles to isrf ) .",
    "b1 shows the time evolution of sfrs in the low - mass model with @xmath36 for the @xmath37 and @xmath38dependent sf recipes .",
    "although the fiducial model shows only slight differences in sfrs between the two different sf recipes , this model shows more remarkable differences in the early sf histories .",
    "the model with the @xmath37dependent sf shows systematically higher sfr for @xmath39 gyr in comparison with that with the @xmath38dependent sf . this suppression of sf in early phase of the disk formation in the @xmath1-dependent sf model is due largely to the lower @xmath1 fraction in the low - mass disk model .",
    "such suppression can be seen in other low - mass models with the @xmath38dependent sf recipe ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "these results imply that the adoption of @xmath38dependent sf recipe is important for sf histories of low - mass disk galaxies .",
    "severe suppression of sf has been already reported by k12 in which @xmath0-regulated sf models are adopted .",
    "in the present model , @xmath1 formation efficiencies depend strongly on dust abundances ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , it is expected that more massive galaxies , where chemical enrichment proceeds more efficiently , can have larger @xmath4 and thus larger @xmath6 .",
    "c1 shows the time evolution of @xmath4 and @xmath6 in the low - mass disk model with @xmath36 and the high - mass one with @xmath41 . clearly , both final @xmath4 and @xmath6 are higher in the high - mass model , and the evolution of @xmath6 is more rapid in the high - mass model . in the present @xmath1 formation model ,",
    "the final @xmath6 in disks with @xmath40 can be very low ( @xmath42 ) , which has important implications of gas contents in dwarf galaxies .",
    "we will discuss such implications in detail in our forthcoming papers ."
