    "specifically , @xcite and @xcite have previously derived solutions for the relative abundances of molecules for purely gaseous chemistry and in c - h - o ( carbon - hydrogen - oxygen ) systems . here , we present novel , generalized analytical solutions for purely gaseous c - h - o - n ( carbon - hydrogen - oxygen - nitrogen ) systems with 6 and 9 molecules . in ",

    "we emphasize that this is an issue of implementation and not of theory . in practice , it is sufficient to obtain the mixing ratio of co by solving the quintic equation in ( [ eq : quintic ] ) , which is numerically stable .",
    "we use the ` polyroots ` routine in ` python ` .",
    "the other mixing ratios are then obtained using equations ( [ eq : eq_constants ] ) , ( [ eq : others ] ) and ( [ eq : others2 ] ) .    in figures [ fig : temperature ] , [ fig : co_ratio ] and [ fig : no_ratio ] , we represent calculations from the ` tea ` code as circles overplotted on our calculations , which are shown as curves .",

    "the trend of ch@xmath2 and co being the dominant carbon carriers at low and high temperatures , respectively , persists even in the presence of nitrogen @xcite .",
    "analogously , nh@xmath1 and n@xmath0 are the dominant nitrogen carriers at low and high temperatures , respectively @xcite .",
    "hcn closely tracks the rise of co with temperature . in a @xmath51 environment",
    ", hcn inhibits the formation of ch@xmath2 and c@xmath0h@xmath0 , as we can see from comparing the solutions derived in the current study versus the nitrogen - free solutions of @xcite .",
    "even when n / o is increased tenfold from 0.2 to 2 , the trends produced resemble those of the solar - abundance case .",
    "figure [ fig : co_ratio ] shows the mixing ratios versus c / o .",
    "the low- and high - temperature trends have previously been elucidated , namely that carbon - rich atmospheres are water - poor and methane - rich @xcite .",
    "hcn closely tracks the abundance of ch@xmath2 as c / o increases , suggesting that the ratio of their abundances should be a constant .",
    "figure [ fig : no_ratio ] shows that the mixing ratios are somewhat insensitive to n / o .",
    "unsurprisingly , only the nitrogen - bearing species ( n@xmath0 , nh@xmath1 and hcn ) show any dependence of their mixing ratios on n / o .    we note that our formulae do not consider graphite formation , which is expected to occur in carbon - rich atmospheres @xcite . for this reason , we urge caution when applying these formulae to @xmath53 situations .      figure [ fig : diagnostic ] shows the ratio of abundances of various pairs of molecules .",
    "the c@xmath0h@xmath0/co@xmath0 ratio is a sensitive diagnostic for c / o @xcite , spanning more than 10 orders of magnitude as c / o varies from 0.1 to 10 , suggesting that this ratio may be used as an observational diagnostic for inferring the value of c / o , provided a given spectrum of an exoplanetary atmosphere has the sufficient resolution and signal - to - noise for such an inference to be made via an inversion technique .",
    "the ch@xmath2/h@xmath0o ratio is somewhat less sensitive to c / o , but provides an additional check on the inferred value of c / o .",
    "the hcn / ch@xmath2 ratio is essentially constant across a factor of 100 in c / o and its value depends only on the metallicity , implying that it may be used as a robust diagnostic for the metallicity of the atmosphere .",
    "we have developed a novel analytical method for computing the abundances of 6 and 9 molecules in a c - h - o - n system in chemical equilibrium .",
    "our work demonstrates a useful trick , which is that trace molecules may formally be left out of the system of non - linear equations and computed later using the mixing ratios of other molecules .",
    "since our formulae have been successfully validated by a gibbs free energy minimization code , they may be used to benchmark chemical kinetics codes .",
    "reproducing chemical equilibrium is a key test of a chemical kinetics code .",
    "our formulae may also be used in retrieval calculations to enforce chemical equilibrium throughout the atmosphere .",
    "such an approach may be used to test the bayesian evidence for chemical disequilibrium when interpreting the spectrum of an exoplanetary atmosphere .",
