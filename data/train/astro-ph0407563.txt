    "clusters of galaxies have historically been detected through their baryon content , either in optical / near - infrared surveys searching for overdensities of galaxies or in x - ray surveys searching for emission from the hot , intracluster medium .",
    "previous observations have found strong differences between x - ray and optically - selected clusters at moderate - to - high redshift , implying that at least some massive clusters do not obey the local x - ray  optical relations . specifically , the properties of the galaxies and the intracluster gas in local abell clusters are strongly related . there",
    "exist well - defined correlations between the x - ray properties of the gas , such as luminosity ( @xmath9 and temperature ( @xmath10 ) , and the optical properties of the galaxies , such as blue luminosity ( @xmath11 ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "these relations indicate that the galaxies and gas are in thermal equilibrium , i.e.  @xmath13 ( edge & stewart 1991 ) . moderate - redshift clusters up to @xmath14 exhibit the same x - ray  optical relations ( mushotzky & scharf 1997 ; horner 2001 ) .",
    "however , x - ray observations of all optically - selected clusters at @xmath15 indicate that they are weak x - ray sources , regardless of their measured richness or velocity dispersion , with luminosities of only a few @xmath16 ergs s@xmath5 ( castander et al .",
    "1994 ; bower et al .  1997 ; holden et al .  1997",
    "; donahue et al .  2001 ; lubin , oke , & postman 2002 ; lubin , mulchaey & postman 2004 ) .",
    "consequently , many optically - selected clusters do not obey the local @xmath17 relation .",
    "their x - ray luminosities are low for their velocity dispersions , indicating that optically - selected clusters at these redshifts are underluminous ( by a factor of @xmath18 ) compared to their x - ray  selected counterparts .",
    "these results seem to imply that , at least for some clusters , the galaxies and gas are no longer in thermal equilibrium and that the clusters are still dynamically young .",
    "strong observational evidence , such as double peaks , significant substructure , and/or a filamentary appearance in the gas , galaxy , and total mass distributions , does indicate that many ( if not most ) clusters at these redshifts are actively forming ( see e.g. , lubin & postman 1996 ; henry et al .",

    "velocity dispersions measured first by postman et al.(2001 ) and more accurately by gal & lubin ( 2004 ) indicate that the system is massive , equivalent to an abell richness class 12 cluster .",
    "it has , however , only a modest x - ray luminosity and temperature of @xmath20 h@xmath21 ergs s@xmath5 and @xmath22 kev , respectively ( lubin et al.2004 ) . based on its measured velocity dispersion of @xmath6 km s@xmath5 , cl 1604 + 4304",
    "is cooler by a factor of 24 compared to the local @xmath23 relation .",
    "gas temperature and galaxy velocity dispersion are only proxies for mass , which can be determined directly by a lensing analysis .",
    "the mass determined by lensing is independent of the cluster s dynamical state , star formation history , and baryon content ( smail , ellis & fitchett 1994 ; smail _ et al .  _  1995",
    ") . as a result",
    ", we have undertaken a weak lensing analysis of cl 1604 + 4304 using deep imaging from the keck 10-m telescope . because weak lensing uses the background galaxy population",
    ", it becomes progressively more difficult to apply to high - redshift clusters .",
    "the highest - redshift cluster previously detected with lensing is ms 1054 - 03 , a very x - ray luminous , hot , massive cluster at @xmath24 ( luppino & kaiser 1998 ; hoekstra , franx , & kuijken 2000 ) .",
    "its x - ray luminosity is @xmath25 h@xmath21 ergs s@xmath5 , and estimates of its x - ray temperature range from 7.2@xmath26 kev to 12.3@xmath27 kev ( gioia _ et al .  _  2004 and references therein )",

    "( 2000 ) determined ms 1054 - 03 weak lensing mass to be @xmath28 within 1 mpc radius , corresponding to a velocity dispersion of @xmath29 km s@xmath5 for an isothermal sphere , in very good agreement with the spectroscopicaly measure of @xmath30 km s@xmath5 ( gioia _ et al .  _  2004",
    "; tran _ et al .  _",
    "in preparation ) .",
    "although cl 1604 + 4304 has a substantially lower gas luminosity and temperature than ms 1054 - 03 , it may be more typical of galaxy clusters at these redshifts because the number density of very x - ray luminous clusters declines significantly at redshifts of @xmath31 ( e.g. , mullis et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "in addition to deep imaging , weak lensing analyses of high - redshift clusters requires better knowledge of the source redshift distribution . to calibrate the mass of a lens",
    ", one must know the mean distance ratio of the sources . for typical source redshifts around unity ,",
    "uncertainties of the order of 10% in the source redshift distribution matter little for a low - redshift cluster , but they represent a large systematic error when the lensing cluster is itself at a redshift of @xmath32 . here , the tail of the source redshift distribution is behind the cluster , and it becomes crucial to minimize the errors in estimating this tail . in this paper , we introduce a new method of estimating the source redshift distribution based on degrading higher - quality data rather than estimating the faint tail of one s own data . in  2",
    "& 3 , we describe the data and our weak lensing analysis . in  4 , we summarize our results and discuss future plans for a more accurate weak lensing measurement of this cluster .",
    "the imaging used in the weak lensing analysis was obtained on 27 july 1999 at the keck 10-m telescope using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "the pixel scale of lris is @xmath33 , and its field of view is approximately @xmath34 .",
    "the seeing was excellent at @xmath35 full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) in the center of the image , with some degradation to an average of @xmath36 at the edges .",
    "twenty - nine @xmath1-band images with exposure times of 300 sec each were taken .",
    "a dither pattern of @xmath37 in width was used to minimize the effect of bad columns and bright stars .",
    "conditions were not photometric ; however , photometric calibration was obtained from a shallower observation of the same area , with the same instrument , on a photometric night .",
    "these calibration images were taken as part of the oke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) survey of nine high - redshift clusters of galaxies ( see also postman et al .  1998 , 2001 ) .    the imaging data was reduced using standard iraf routines , with the usual corrections ( including bias and flatfielding ) being applied .",
    "individual exposures were aligned and co - added to create a single , deep @xmath1-band image with an effective exposure time of 8700 sec .",
    "the final image is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : image ] . to perform our weak lensing analysis ,",
    "the intrinsic anisotropy of the point - spread function ( psf ) has to be corrected .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : circ ] shows the ellipticity and position angles of 127 stars as a function of position , before correction .",
    "the mean ellipticity is @xmath38 , with a rms of @xmath39 , and the position angles are highly spatially correlated .",
    "we convolved the image with a kernel with ellipticity components opposite to that of the psf at each point @xcite .",
    "however , the 3@xmath403 pixel kernel used was not large enough to correct the psf completely in one pass .",
    "therefore we iterated four times , until improvement stopped .",
    "each iteration also allowed us to clip a few more interloping compact galaxies from the psf sample , leaving a clean sample of 127 stars at the end .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : circ ] shows the result .",
    "the mean ellipticity decreased to @xmath41 with a @xmath42 rms , and the position angles are no longer spatially correlated . after rounding , the final fwhm varied from @xmath43 at the center to an average of @xmath44 at the edges .",
    "the object detection and photometry was performed with sextractor version 2.2.2 @xcite , resulting in a catalog of 4424 objects ( 136 per arcmin@xmath45 ) .",
    "the galaxy counts peak at @xmath46 , and the magntiude limit is @xmath47 for a 5@xmath12 detection .",
    "we measure weighted moments of objects using the ellipto software described in @xcite , discarding any sources which triggered error flags .",
    "we also use their seeing correction procedure , which corrects for the dilution of the shear signal due to the isotropic smearing of the psf .",
    "we discarded sources which were not at least 25% larger than the psf at that position , rather than apply a large and noisy correction .",
    "because of the strong stellar size dependence with position on the ccd ( up to 30% ) , a second order spatial fit was used in the the seeing correction .",
    "this spatial variation in the size selection function does not bias the shapes of the objects , but it does impose a spatial variation on the source redshift distribution , which will be discussed below .    objects with ellipticity greater than 0.6 tend to be blends of multiple sources and were also excluded from the lensing analysis . the number of objects passing all these quality checks is 1588 ( 49 per arcmin@xmath45 ) .",
    "we measure the tangential shear around the cluster optical center , using background galaxies with @xmath48 ( see right panel of figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "because the area closest to the core is expected to be dominated by cluster members , we use only sources at radius @xmath49 for the weak lensing analysis .",
    "the final number of galaxies is 1053 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ann ] shows the mean tangential shear for four annuli around the optical center , with 1@xmath12 errors attached . as a null test , we also show in open circles the other ( 45@xmath50 ) shear component , which is consistent with zero as expected .",
    "these measurements are also indicated in table  [ tab : shear ] .",
    "the tangential shear is detected at 1.8 and 2.0@xmath12 respectively in the two inner points , which has only a 2.5% probablility of happening randomly .",
    "hence the detection confidence is 97.5% .",
    "we do not expect to detect shear in the outer two points , given the redshift and velocity dispersion previously measured for this cluster ( see below ) . as a measurement of the expected level of psf systematics",
    ", we also show in figure  [ fig : ann ] that the `` tangential shear '' computed from the stars is consistent with zero .    to avoid the mass sheet degeneracy inherent in mass reconstructions of small fields ,",
    "we fit a model to the shear profile . given the low signal to noise , we choose to fit the simplest possible model , a singular isothermal sphere , to all four points . assuming a cosmology of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , we find that @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath55 for this fit is 1.25 for three degrees of freedom , hinting that the errors may have been overestimated . as a control ,",
    "we fit an sis to the 45-degree component of the shear and found 0.027 @xmath56 0.022 , with a @xmath55 of 4.09 for three degrees of freedom .    to determine the mass",
    ", we must know the cluster redshift and the source redshift distribution .",
    "for any given mass , the tangential shear is proportional to the combination of _ angular diameter distances _ from the observer to the lens ( @xmath57 ) , from the observer the source ( @xmath58 ) , and from the lens to the source ( @xmath59 ) :    @xmath60    the cluster has a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the challenge then is to estimate @xmath62 for the source population .",
    "this is not the same as estimating the mean redshift of the sources , because the relation is quite nonlinear , and only sources with redshifts of @xmath63 have a non - zero contribution . for high - redshift lenses ,",
    "the estimation of the higher - redshift tail can be little more than guesswork unless additional data are brought to bear .",
    "we estimate the source redshift distribution by degrading the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) , which has a well - known redshift distribution , to match our data .",
    "this is a more stable approach than attempting to extrapolate the ditribution from our data alone , because many of the background galaxies are near the faint limit of our survey .",
    "first , we convolve the f606w ( which is the closest match to our filter ) hdf - n image @xcite with @xmath43 and @xmath44 fwhm gaussian to simulate the range of psf sizes in the keck image",
    ". then , we re - pixelize , add noise , and catalog the image to match the keck data .",
    "we judge the match to be satisfactory because the galaxy counts @xmath64 in the degraded hdfn and keck catalogs are very similar .",
    "we then apply the same magnitude and size cuts used in the lensing analysis of the keck image , and look up their photometric redshifts @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : magz ] shows the mean photometric redshift and @xmath65 scatter as a function of magnitude for both psf sizes .",
    "the histogram indicates the distribution of magnitudes of the lensing sources in cl1604 . throughout the relevant magnitude range ,",
    "the mean source redshift is nearly constant at @xmath66 .",
    "we convert each source photometric redshift to a distance ratios @xmath67 , and take the mean .",
    "this mean , @xmath68 mpc , corresponds to an effective source redshift of @xmath69 .",
    "again , this is not the same as the mean source redshift ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "finally , we check that the magnification provided by the cluster does not significantly change the source redshift distribution near the cluster center .",
    "figure  [ fig : magnification ] shows the magnification for a source at @xmath70 expected for a 1004 km s@xmath5 cluster at @xmath0 , as a function of projected radius .",
    "it is at most 0.4 mag , at the innermost radius used for tangential shear measurement . because of the nearly constant redshift distribution seen in figure  [ fig : magz ] , this additional depth has negligible impact on the effective source redshift .",
    "the relative uncertainties of the shear and the distance ratio statistics are shown in figure  [ fig : mass ] .",
    "the shaded areas indicate 1 , 2 and 3@xmath12 confidence limits for the fit shown in figure  [ fig : ann ] . combining the shear measurement with the mean distance ratio ,",
    "the weak lensing mass estimate for this cluster is @xmath71 @xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to an inferred velocity dispersion of @xmath4 km s@xmath5 , which agrees with the measured velocity dispersion of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "our weak lensing measurement is also reasonably consistent with the velocity dispersion ( @xmath72 ) inferred from the x - ray temperature ( @xmath10 ) of cl 1604 . using the best - fit to the @xmath73 relation for clusters at @xmath74 ( mushotzky & scharf 1997 ; horner 2001 ) , the measured temperature of @xmath75 kev ( lubin et al .",
    "2004 ) implies a velocity dispersion of @xmath7 km s@xmath5 which is consistent within @xmath8 .",
    "however , given the large non - statistical scatter in the local @xmath76 relation , the differences between the velocity dispersion measurements may be well less than 2@xmath12 .",
    "we report the weak lensing detection of cl 1604 + 4304 at a redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "this is the highest - redshift cluster yet detected with weak lensing .",
    "we find a mass estimate of @xmath77 @xmath3 , independent of the cluster s dynamical state .",
    "this mass estimate is in good agreement with the spectroscopic velocity dispersion .",
    "unfortunately , we can not measure the optical mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) because the small field does not provide adequate control regions .",
    "a wider field would serve three purposes : ( 1 ) provide control regions for the luminosity distribution , ( 2 ) allow a direct mass reconstruction without mass sheet degeneracy , and ( 3 ) show the larger scale structure associated with cl 1604 + 4304 .",
    "the former benefit is of great interest because we know that cl 1604 + 4304 is a member of a supercluster which contains at least four massive clusters and extends up to @xmath78 mpc @xcite . because the dynamics of such a large scale structure are very complex , mass measurements which do not rely on galaxy velocities are essential .",
    "in addition to a wide field , one must also go extremely deep in good seeing conditions to perform an adequate weak lensing analysis of clusters at @xmath79 . the combination of wide and deep , now available at a few facilities such as the subaru telescope in conjunction with suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) , offers the possiblity of constraining the mass of @xmath80 clusters , including cl 1604 + 4304 , independent of their star formation history or dynamical state .",
