    "the renormalization of the properties of the vector mesons in nuclear matter has received much attention , particularly the @xmath2 meson , ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the @xmath0 meson has received comparatively less attention , but it turns out to be a well suited tool to understand the dynamics of the vector mesons in matter since the changes of some of the @xmath0 properties are comparatively larger than those of the @xmath2 meson , what would make its experimental observation in principle easier .",
    "the change of the @xmath0 properties in the medium at finite temperature and/or density has been studied in several approaches like effective lagrangians @xcite and qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "particularly , the @xmath0 width modification in matter has been subject of study in dropping meson mass scenarios @xcite , as a result of collisional broadening through @xmath0-baryon @xcite or @xmath0-meson @xcite scattering processes and by modifying the @xmath3 decay channel by means of in - medium kaon selfenergies @xcite .",
    "the majority of these works point at a sizeable renormalization of the @xmath0 width and a small mass shift .",
    "indeed , in @xcite it was found that the @xmath0 width at normal nuclear matter density , @xmath4 , was about one order of magnitude larger than the free width .",
    "particularly , the results of @xcite were based on the use of a @xmath5 selfenergy in nuclear matter which accounted for pauli blocking correction in the intermediate @xmath6 sates in the scattering equation .",
    "further studies considering the selfconsistency of the @xmath7 in - medium scattering equation were done in @xcite to determine the @xmath5 selfenergy . following those results a reanalysis of the @xmath0 width in the medium",
    "was done in @xcite , resulting in values around @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "a more recent evaluation , using the @xmath5 selfenergy of @xcite and improving on some approximations of @xcite was done in @xcite , resulting in a width of about @xmath10 at @xmath9 and a small shift in the mass of about @xmath11 .",
    "several proposals to test the @xmath0 properties in a nuclear medium have been done , for instance , regarding the detection of its decay products in @xmath12 and @xmath13 collisions @xcite .",
    "particularly a method to analyse the invariant mass spectra of the emitted charged kaon pairs was studied in @xcite .",
    "having into account that the calculations in @xcite were done for a @xmath0 at rest in the nucleus , it has been suggested to determine this large width using reactions like @xmath14 in nuclei @xcite and @xmath0 photoproduction in nuclei @xcite , assuming the @xmath0 to emerge with a small momentum .",
    "the latter proposal is possible by means of the elementary @xmath15 reaction with the @xmath0 going in the backward direction and the help of the fermi motion of the nucleons .",
    "the small cross section for these particular events makes this experiment difficult and in addition it was shown in @xcite that the distribution of the @xmath16 pairs from the coulomb interaction in heavy nuclei removed the changes in the @xmath0 width in the @xmath16 invariant mass that one might expect from the changes of the @xmath0 width in the medium .",
    "another possibility , not previously considered , to investigate the changes of the @xmath0 width is to look for @xmath0 loss of flux in @xmath0 nuclear photoproduction .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence in this loss is related to the @xmath0 width in the medium .",
    "the drawback is that in this experiment the largest fraction of the @xmath0 comes out with a momentum of the order of @xmath17 in the ongoing experiment at _",
    "spring8/osaka _ @xcite",
    ". the combination of experiment and theoretical models , which can make the extrapolation of @xmath0 at rest to @xmath0 with finite momenta , can thus make the experiment useful to learn about @xmath0 nuclear properties .    with this aim , we present here a theoretical calculation of the @xmath1 dependence of the cross section for @xmath0 photoproduction in nuclei which could test the models of @xcite .",
    "our work will be based on the models for the @xmath0 selfenergy of oset - ramos  ( or )  @xcite and cabrera - vicente  ( cv )  @xcite , after a proper extension to account for the finite momentum .",
    "let @xmath18 be the @xmath0 selfenergy in a nuclear medium as a function of its momentum , @xmath19 , and the nuclear density , @xmath2 .",
    "we have    @xmath20    and hence @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the @xmath0 energy and @xmath23 is the @xmath0 decay probability , including nuclear quasielastic and absorption channels .",
    "hence , we have for the probability of loss of flux per unit length    @xmath24    the nuclear cross section for inclusive @xmath0 photoproduction will then be    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the elementary and nuclear differential cross section and @xmath28 with @xmath29 the @xmath0 production point inside the nucleus .",
    "the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eikonal1 ] ) represents the survival probability of the @xmath0 meson in its way out of the nucleus .",
    "if the @xmath0 did not get absorbed inside the nucleus then we would get the typical result for an electromagnetic reaction @xmath30 .",
    "( [ eq : eikonal1 ] ) relies in the eikonal approximation which is accurate for the large @xmath0 momentum involved in the process . in practice",
    "one might expect small corrections to the formula , even if the @xmath0 did not decay , from two sources :    \\i ) distortion of the @xmath0 trajectory because of the real part of the potential    \\ii ) change of direction and energy of the @xmath0 in quasielastic collisions @xmath31 .",
    "the first effect should be negligible since the real part of the potential is so weak that only modifies the mass of the @xmath0 in about @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the second effect should be very weak too , account taken of the lack of direct coupling @xmath33 because of the ozi rule .",
    "on the other hand , the effect from this source would simply lead to a slight change in the @xmath0 direction but not the disappearance of the @xmath0 .",
    "this simply means that collecting the @xmath0 in a narrow cone along the forward direction , where practically all the @xmath0 go , both because of the kinematics of the lab variables and the extremely forward direction of the @xmath34 cross section @xcite , would guarantee that the @xmath0 undergoing quasielastic collisions in the nucleus are accounted for in the nuclear cross section . in order to adjust to this experiment",
    "we should not remove theoretically the events in which there are @xmath0 quasielastic collisions .",
    "this will be done by including in @xmath35 only the @xmath0 absorption events .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eikonal1 ] ) does not depend on the direction of the @xmath0 momentum and thus we have    @xmath36    and this is the magnitude which we would evaluate as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath1 , which can be interpreted as the probability for a @xmath0 to go out of the nucleus . the density profiles , @xmath37 , for the different nuclei have been taken from @xcite .",
    "for the evaluation of @xmath35 in nuclear matter we are going to use the or and cv models which are based on chiral @xmath38 dynamics considering the @xmath39 and @xmath40 in - medium properties . in these works",
    "the evaluations were done for a @xmath0 at rest . since in the present work we are dealing with @xmath0 mesons with momentum up to @xmath41 , an extension of the models to finite momenta",
    "is mandatory . in the following subsections we summarize these two models stressing the modifications to consider the finite @xmath0 momentum .",

    "since the @xmath5 p - wave selfenergy is proportional to @xmath49 , it is likely to be more affected inside the loops by the finiteness of the @xmath0 momentum .",
    "hence we evaluate explicitly the @xmath0 selfenergy from the p - wave @xmath5 selfenergy diagrams at finite @xmath0 momentum and take the same part coming from the @xmath5 s - wave selfenergy as obtained for zero momentum .",
    "this latter part produces a contribution to the imaginary part of the @xmath0 selfenergy that can be parametrized as @xmath50    we now evaluate the contribution to @xmath51 of the @xmath48 p - wave selfenergy diagrams , depicted in fig .",

    "in fig .  [ fig : impi ] we show the imaginary part of the @xmath0 selfenergy as a function of the @xmath0 momentum for different nuclear densities and for the two models described in section  [ sec : angels ] ( dashed line ) and [ sec : dani ] ( solid line ) . the contribution to @xmath35 coming from the free @xmath0 decay into @xmath93 , non",

    "[ fig : impi ] between the two models at zero momentum , the trend of the plot as the momentum increases is very similar .",

    "we observe that for @xmath95 and heavy nuclei this ratio can be of the order of @xmath96 , indicating a clear @xmath0 loss of flux which should be identifiable experimentally .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pout_vs_p ] we show instead the results for @xmath94 as a function of the @xmath0 momentum for two nuclei and comparing the two theoretical models . in this figure",
    "we observe that the amount of @xmath0 flux lost is larger for smaller @xmath0 momentum .",
    "this is logical to expect since the probability of @xmath0 decay per unit length is @xmath97 , which is larger for small momenta because of the factor @xmath98 .",
    "this occurs in spite of the fact that @xmath99 decreases with @xmath19 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : impi ] , because this @xmath19 dependence is weaker than that of @xmath98 .",
    "the set up of the experiment at _",
    "spring8/osaka _ @xcite is such that it produces @xmath0 momenta around @xmath100 , using photons from @xmath101 to @xmath102 , coming from @xmath0 production in the forward direction in the cm frame . a possibility to extract",
    "further information is to use photons of lower energy , around , @xmath103 , not far from threshold which leads to @xmath0 of around @xmath104 in the cm frame and around @xmath105 in the lab frame .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : pout_vs_p ] , in a nucleus like @xmath106 the depletion factor goes from @xmath107 at @xmath108 to @xmath109 at @xmath110 .",
    "this latter factor would be @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "so far the only nuclear effects considered have been the ones related to the absorption of the @xmath0 meson . at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning that other nuclear effects regarding the production mechanism may lead to a further @xmath0 loss of flux or change in the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "these other nuclear effects are mainly the pauli blocking of the final nucleon and the fermi motion of the initial one .",
    "the first one may lead to a reduction of the @xmath0 flux in comparison to the free case because a certain amount of events are forbidden due to the pauli blocking of the final nucleon . on the other hand",
    "the initial fermi motion can distort the distribution of the final @xmath0 mesons . in order to estimate the possible flux reduction due to these sources , we have included in the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eikonal2 ] ) a factor @xmath113 which considers a fermi average of these effects @xcite :    @xmath114    where @xmath115 with @xmath116 the momentum transfer of the nucleon and @xmath117 is the fermi momentum of the nucleons .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pout_vs_p_pauli ] we show @xmath94 , with the cv model , as a function of the @xmath0 momentum for @xmath118 . in solid line",
    "we show the result without considering the effect of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pauli ] ) , ( i.e. , the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pout_vs_p ] ) .",
    "the other lines represent the results considering the pauli effect estimation , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : pauli ] ) .",
    "note that the @xmath116 dependence of this @xmath119 factor introduces another kinematical variable in the @xmath120 observable .",
    "we have chosen this extra variable to be the zenithal angle of the @xmath0 meson in the lab frame ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the dashed and dot - dashed curves represent the results considering the pauli effect for @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively .",
    "we can see that significant effects are obtained for large @xmath0 momenta , what is expectable since large @xmath0 momenta imply small final nucleon momenta , which are strongly pauli blocked .",
    "the pauli effect also decreases with the @xmath0 meson angle because the momentum transfer strongly increases with this angle , therefore the largest effect is obtained for the @xmath0 forward direction .",
    "since the @xmath0 photoproduction is strongly forward peaked , one can expect @xmath120 to be actually somewhere between the dashed and dot - dashed lines in a real experiment .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pout_vs_a_pauli ] we show the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath120 , with the cv model , without including the pauli correction ( solid line ) and including it for @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( dashed and dot - dashed lines respectively ) , all for @xmath124 where the effect is maximum .",
    "we observe that the loss of flux due to the pauli correction is nearly constant in a wide range of the mass number , resulting in a reduction of around @xmath125 in @xmath120 for the forward direction .",
    "nonetheless this effect is relatively smaller for heavier nuclei compared to the @xmath0 absorption .",
    "the cross sections calculated in this work are inclusive , summing over all possible final nuclear excited states .",
    "the coherent cross section , where the final nucleus is the original one , is not included in the calculation .",
    "its evaluation requires a complete knowledge of the spin and isospin dependence of the elementary @xmath126 amplitude and a different treatment than the one done here .",
    "the coherent cross section involves the square of the product of the mass number and the nuclear form factor times the square of the spin - isospin averaged amplitude .",
    "the coherent and incoherent cross sections can in principle be separated experimentally , as done in the case of pions around the delta energy region @xcite . however",
    ", this might be difficult at higher energies where one usually has a poorer energy resolution .",
    "an alternative to this separation , concerning the present work , is to look for @xmath0 production at finite angles where the momentum transfer to the nucleus is large and the coherent process can be neglected .",
    "the incoherent cross section sums the square of the spin - flip and non spin - flip amplitudes , while in the coherent part only the spin independent part contributes .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the nuclear form factor and @xmath129 the pauli blocking factor of eq .  ( [ eq : pauli ] ) , is an upper bound for the ratio of coherent to incoherent nuclear cross sections .",
    "we have studied this ratio as a function of the photon energy , the @xmath0 meson angle and the mass number .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : 1 ) we find that below @xmath130 the ratio of coherent to incoherent cross section is smaller than ten percent for all angles and nuclei beyond @xmath131 .",
    "2 ) the ratio increases rapidly with the photon energy , since the momentum transfer decreases .",
    "for instance at @xmath132 , for @xmath133 and forward angles , the ratio can be of the order of 50 percent , but for heavier nuclei the ratio is smaller .",
    "for instance , for @xmath134 this ratio is smaller than 10 percent .",
    "we also obtain that beyond 4 degrees the ratio is only a few percent and can be safely neglected . in practical terms , from the experimental point of view , we can say that in nuclei around @xmath135 or heavier and photon energies smaller than @xmath136 , the coherent contribution is negligible .",
    "this discussion may serve to select an experimental setup in which the coherent contribution can be neglected , hence facilitating the interpretation of the data .",
    "we have shown that using present models for the @xmath0 selfenergy in a nuclear medium , conveniently extrapolated to finite @xmath0 momenta , it is possible to evaluate the survival rate of @xmath0 produced in nuclear @xmath0 photoproduction , and how this survival rate is tied to the @xmath0 width in the medium and the momentum of the @xmath0 .",
    "the survival rates for @xmath0 coming from photons in the range of @xmath137 to @xmath102 are of the order of @xmath109 , a significant deviation from unity , which are measurable experimentally .",
    "we have shown the @xmath1 dependence of the expected @xmath94 ratio as well as its dependence on the @xmath0 momentum .",
    "comparison of the results with experimental numbers of the incoming experiments would help determine the accuracy of the models used .",
    "these models could then be used to extrapolate results at other @xmath0 momenta and one could then get a fair idea of how the @xmath0 properties are modified in nuclear matter for @xmath0 at any finite momenta below those studied in the present work .",

    "<S> based on a prior determination of the @xmath0 selfenergy in a nuclear medium we perform a theoretical study of inclusive @xmath0 photoproduction in nuclei , looking at the @xmath1 dependence of the cross sections for different @xmath0 momenta . </S>",
    "<S> we find sizeable reductions in the nuclear cross sections with respect to the elementary one , using a @xmath0 selfenergy which implies a width about six times the free one at normal nuclear density . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are done to match the set up for an ongoing experiment at _ spring8/osaka _ which should provide valuable information on the renormalization of the @xmath0 properties in nuclei . </S>"
