    "the gluon distribution in the nuclear target is an essential ingredient in the calculation of high energy nuclear collisions , which relate to minijet production , dilepton production , heavy quarks and their bound states .",
    "although the gluon density in a free nucleon was extracted by the experiments , however there are not enough data for the gluon distributions in nuclei .",
    "as well known the parton densities in a bound nucleon differ from in a free nucleon , the ratio of nuclear and deuterium structure functions is smaller or lager than unity at bjorken variable @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "these two facts are called the nuclear shadowing and antishadowing effects , respectively [ 1 ] .",
    "the understanding of nuclear shadowing and antishadowing in qcd is therefore an important issue to predict the nuclear gluon distributions . in this aspect ,",
    "the parton recombination ( fusion ) between two different nucleons in a nucleus is a natural mechanism , which transfers the partons from a smaller @xmath1 region to a larger @xmath1 region and forms the nuclear shadowing and antishadowing effects [ 2 ] .",
    "the shadowing and antishadowing phenomena are also predicted to happen in a free nucleon : a rapid rise of parton multiplicities inside the proton at small @xmath1 leads to the gluon recombination , which changes the distributions of gluon- and quark - densities , but does not change their total momenta . in consequence , a part of the gluon momentum lost in the shadowing should be compensated in terms of new gluons with larger @xmath1 , which form the antishadowing .",
    "the modification of the gluon recombination to the standard dglap [ 3 ] evolution equation was first proposed by gribov - levin - ryskin and mueller - qiu ( the glr - mq equation ) in [ 4 ] , and it is naturally regarded as the qcd dynamics of the nuclear shadowing since the type of gluon fusion in a nucleon is still there in a nucleus but roughly differs by an @xmath5 scale [ 5 ] .",
    "however , the glr - mq equation does not predict the nuclear antishadowing effect since the momentum conservation in the gluon recombination is violated in this equation . for this sake",
    ", a modified dglap equation was proposed to replace the glr - mq equation in [ 6,7 ] , where the corrections of the gluon fusion to the dglap equation lead to the shadowing and antishadowing effects .",
    "unfortunately , the integral solutions either in the glr - mq equation or in other modified dglap equations need the initial distributions on a boundary line @xmath6 at fixed @xmath7 , and they contain the unknown input nuclear shadowing and antishadowing effects .",
    "close , qiu and roberts [ 8 ] constructed a parton fusion model by qcd arguments and try to evolve the input parton distributions in the nuclear target , however , the results of this parton fusion model in the small @xmath1 region are sensitive to the input parton distributions [ 9 ] , which leads to a large uncertainty in the predictions . on the other hand ,",
    "recently nuclear unintegrated gluon distribution becomes a useful and intuitive phenomenological language for applications to many high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "however , the dglap equation and its modified forms are based on the collinear factorization scheme and they do nt predict the evolution of the unintegrated parton distributions .    instead of the above - mentioned modified dglap equations , an alternative qcd research for the nuclear shadowing and antishadowing is to modify the bfkl equation [ 10 ] , which is directly written for the unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "the evolutions of the bfkl - type equations are along the small @xmath1-direction : the input gluons distribute on the boundary line @xmath8 at fixed @xmath9 , where the gluon fusion begins , and @xmath10 parton distributions both in a free nucleon and in a bound nucleon at @xmath11 are the evolution results of these equations .",
    "there are several nonlinear evolution equations considering the corrections of the gluon fusion to the bfkl evolution .",
    "one of the most widely studied models is the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation [ 11 ] .",
    "the bk equation is originally derived for the scattering amplitude in the transverse coordinator space .",
    "the nonlinear terms in the bk equation are formed by the dipole splitting and the screening effect origins from the double scattering of the probe on the target .",
    "a remarkable solution of the bk equation is the so - called saturation , where the amplitude is a completely flat spectrum .",
    "however , the amplitude in the bk equation is re - normalized to identify the coefficient of the nonlinear term with that of the linear term .",
    "therefore , the relation of the unintegrated gluon distribution with this scattering amplitude is unclear and it is model - dependent [ 12 ] . besides",
    ", it is similar to the glr - mq equation , the bk equation is irrelevant to the antishadowing effect .",
    "recently , a new modified bfkl equation incorporating the shadowing and antishadowing corrections of the gluon recombination to the unintegrated gluon distribution was proposed by ruan , shen , yang and zhu ( the rsyz equation ) [ 13 ] .",
    "the purpose of this work is to explain the observed nuclear shadowing and antishadowing effects for the parton distributions using the rsyz equation .",
    "the @xmath0- and @xmath1-variations of the nuclear parton distributions in the rsyz equation are detailed in this work .",
    "particularly , we predict the unintegrated nuclear gluon distributions using the rsyz equation .",
    "the results show a logarithmic increasing spectral height , which is not identical to the prediction of the bk equation in the transverse coordinator space but is similar to a mean field result .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give the rsyz equation and its modifications in the nuclear target .",
    "the predictions of the rsyz equation to the nuclear shadowing and antishadowing effects in the quark- and gluon - distributions as well as in the unintegrated gluon distributions are presented in section 3 .",
    "the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath12 in a proton obeys the rsyz evolution equation at small @xmath1 [ 13 ] , where the contributions of the gluon recombination to the bfkl dynamics are considered    @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15    @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) if the gluons are uniformly distributed in a nucleon ( or the gluons are located in the hot - spots ) ; @xmath9 is the starting point of the gluon fusions .",
    "note that the shadowing and antishadowing coexist in the region @xmath19 , while there is only the antishadowing in @xmath20 [ 14 ] .",
    "we should point out that the nonlinear terms in eq .",
    "( 1 ) are really from the evolution kernel of the md - dglap equation [ 6 ] , where the double logarithmic approximation is taken , i.e. , both the @xmath1 and transverse momenta are strongly ordered .",
    "obviously , this approximation satisfies such @xmath1-region , where the values of @xmath1 are not extra small . on the other hand , the linear terms of eq .",
    "( 1 ) are the bfkl - kernel , which works in the small @xmath1 range . the mix of two approximations in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is feasible for the discussions of the nuclear shadowing and antishadowing effects , since they occupy the transition range from a middle @xmath1 to small @xmath1 .",
    "the rsyz is directly derived for the unintegrated gluon distribution , which relates to the ( integrated ) gluon distribution using    @xmath21    since the density of gluons increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath1 , the sea quark distributions are increasingly dominated by the gluon distribution , via the dglap splitting @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the deep inelastic structure function at small @xmath1 reads [ 15 ]    @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dglap splitting function .",
    "now we discuss the rsyz equation in the nuclear target .",
    "the gluons with smaller @xmath1 exceed the longitudinal size of nucleon in a nucleus .",
    "we assume that the gluons inside the nucleus are completely overlapping and fusion along the longitudinal momentum direction at the evolution starting point @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the strength of the nonlinear recombination terms in eq .",
    "( 1 ) should be scaled by @xmath5 in a nucleus . on the other hand , although the softer gluons of different nucleons with extra small @xmath26 may be correlated on the transverse plane because the integrations on @xmath26 can go down to a very small value in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we neglect these corrections due to @xmath27 . in this simple model",
    "the rsyz equation in the nucleus becomes    @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30    @xmath28",
    "@xmath29 @xmath31    the distributions @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the nucleus are computed by using the equations corresponding to eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "we use a parameter form of a bfkl - like solution as the input distribution [ 13 ] at @xmath34        @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) indicates that the evolution from @xmath44 to @xmath45 is controlled by eq .",
    "( 1 ) but without the antishadowing contributions ( or is controlled by the bfkl equation ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 implies the different velocities approaching the bk dynamics .",
    "we temporarily take @xmath47 and we will indicate it is appropriate .    at first , we use the well known @xmath48-data [ 16 ] of a free proton to determine the parameters in the computations .",
    "then we predict the distributions in nuclei . in this work we fix the coupling constant to be @xmath49 . the dashed curve in fig .",
    "1 is our fitting result using @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "note that the contributions from the valence quarks to @xmath53 at @xmath54 are necessary and they can be parameterized by the difference between the dashed curve and the experimental solid curve in fig",
    "figure 2 shows the predictions of the rsyz equation for the ca / c , ca / li , ca / d and cu / d compared with the emc and nmc results [ 17,18 ] .",
    "the agreement is acceptable .",
    "figure 3 indicates that the enhancement in the sn gluon distribution with respect to that in c observed by nmc [ 19 ] is consistent with our predictions .",
    "no significant @xmath0-dependence on the ratios of the structure functions at small @xmath1 has been concluded in the present experimental precision .",
    "however , it does not prevent us exposing the possible @xmath0-variations of the nuclear shadowing , which may be hidden in the larger experimental errors . the ratios @xmath55 for gluon distributions at @xmath56 and @xmath57 using eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are given in fig.4a .",
    "the @xmath0-variations of the gluon ratios are predicted in the region @xmath58 in our model .",
    "the logarithmic slope @xmath59 in @xmath60 is positive .",
    "however , the corresponding slope in the ratio of the structure functions @xmath61 is negative ( see fig.4b ) .",
    "for example , the predicted @xmath0-slope for calcium at @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and at @xmath64 , @xmath65 , the results are compatible with the measured data in [ 20 ] .",
    "a more significant @xmath0-dependence of the structure function ratios can be found in the heavy nucleus @xmath66 .",
    "a flatter ratio at @xmath67 in the e665 data [ 21 ] was presented .",
    "however , it ca nt be understood as the saturation behavior , where the parton fusion balances the parton splitting .",
    "the reason is that the parton densities in the proton still increase toward the small @xmath1-direction at @xmath68 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "alternatively , we consider that this behavior is a consequence of the @xmath0-variations of the structure function ratios since the experimental point with the smaller @xmath1 corresponds to the smaller value of @xmath0 in fig",
    "an important parameter in the computing rsyz equation is @xmath46 in eq .",
    "the observed nuclear shadowing and antishadowing provide an example to determine the value of @xmath46 .",
    "the results incline to a minimum antishadowing , i. e. , @xmath47 .    comparing with the modified dglap equation",
    ", the rsyz equation directly predicts the nuclear unintegrared gluon distributions , which are important information for the researches of high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "we compute the unintegrated gluon distributions in different nuclear targets using the rsyz equation . in fig",
    ". 6 we plot the spectra of the gluon density on the transverse momentum squared @xmath69 .",
    "the bk equation on the transverse coordinator space predict the saturation solutions , where the amplitude is a completely flat spectrum at @xmath70 , and the spectral height is irrelevant to the values of @xmath1 ( i.e. , the geometric scaling ) ; @xmath71 is the saturation scale .",
    "the saturation limit and the geometric scaling are expected to appear in the larger nucleus , where the shadowing effects are enhanced .",
    "however , the logarithmic increasing spectral height in our results is not identical to this prediction of the bk equation but is similar to the mean field result : @xmath72 [ 22 ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the dependence of our solutions with the input distributions . for this sake",
    ", we change the parameters in eq .",
    "( 24 ) to : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and strongly distort the input form",
    ". then we repeat our calculating programs .",
    "we find that the results are insensitive to the input distributions .    in summary , the nuclear shadowing and antishadowing effects are explained by a unitarized bfkl equation .",
    "the @xmath0- and @xmath1-variations of the nuclear parton distributions are detailed based on the level of the unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "in particular , the asymptotical behavior of the unintegrated gluon distribution in various nuclear targets is studied .",
    "we find that the geometric scaling in the expected saturation range is violated .",
    "our results in the nuclear targets are insensitive to the input distributions if the parameters are fixed by the data of a free proton .",
    "we believe that these results are useful in studying the ultrarelastivistic heavy ion collisions .",
