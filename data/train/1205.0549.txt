    "relativistic extragalactic jets carry their power in the form of particles and fields . estimating how many leptons and protons and the importance of the magnetic field flowing in the jet is not trivial , since these values depend on the model we use to explain the radiation we see , and to the presence of electron  positron pairs .",
    "the latter quantity has been a subject of investigation for a long time , with some consensus emerging about the scenario in which pairs are indeed present , but not dominating the dynamics of the jet .",
    "this can be translated into a pair to proton number ratio of the order of a few tens .",
    "the arguments that have been put forward are the following .    1 .",
    "the spectra of powerful blazars are dominated by the high energy @xmath0ray component : the synchrotron luminosity is a factor 10100 smaller .",
    "this translates in a limit on the importance of the poynting flux ( e.g. celotti & ghisellini 2008 ) , that can not dominate the jet power at the scale where the @xmath0ray emission is produced . in turn",
    ", this implies that , at these scales , the jet must be matter dominated .",
    "2 .   if we have to produce enough pairs to contribute to the total leptonic component in the jet region where most of the [ 100 mev ",
    "100 gev ] @xmath0ray luminosity is emitted , the source should be opaque for @xmath0@xmath0 collisions in the entire [ 100 mev  100 gev ] band .",
    "this requires a large photon density , in turn implying a fast cooling for compton scattering .",
    "thus most of the absorbed luminosity is reprocessed to lower frequencies , especially in the x  ray band . in these cases the x",
    " ray flux should be larger than observed ( ghisellini & madau 1996 ) .",
    "therefore a large number of pairs must necessarily be produced in the inner jet ( e.g. blandford & levinson 1995 ; sikora & madejski 2000 ) . in these regions",
    "radiative cooling is severe , and pairs would quickly cool .",
    "if they are created copiously , such that their thomson optical depth @xmath8 , they would quickly annihilate in a dynamical time ( i.e. the time needed for the region to double its size ) .",
    "the surviving pairs would correspond to @xmath9 in the inner jet ( ghisellini et al .",
    "this sets an upper limit to the number of pairs able to reach the parsec ",
    "scale , allowing celotti & fabian ( 1992 ) to constrain the amounts of pairs there .",
    "cold leptons , traveling with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath10 , would interact with the photons produced by the accretion disk and re",
    " isotropized by broad line clouds and/or scattered by free electrons external to the jet ( begelman & sikora 1987 ) .",
    "the resulting emission would be narrowly peaked , and mainly in the soft x  rays .",
    "observers within the @xmath11 beaming angle would see this radiation as a x  ray  bump \" superimposed on the continuum ( sikora & madejski 2000 ; sikora et al .",
    "1997 ; moderski et al . 2004 ; celotti , ghisellini & fabian 2007 ) .",
    "the absence of this feature sets constraints on the total amount of leptons , and argue against a jet dynamically dominated by e+e- pairs .",
    "if the main emission process of the 100 mev  10 gev radiation we detect from blazars is the inverse compton scattering of relativistic leptons off seed photons produced externally to the jet , then the pattern of the radiation , as seen in the comoving frame , is anisotropic ( dermer 1995 ) .",
    "more power is emitted in the upward direction , and the emitting region must recoil . if the jet is  light \" , only composed by e+e- pairs , the recoil would be enough to stop the bulk motion of the jet .",
    "in this way we can set an upper limit on the amount of pairs , that translates in un upper limit of 1020 on the pair to proton number ratio ( ghisellini & tavecchio 2010 ) .",
    "the presence of pairs in the region where most of the observed @xmath0rays are produced has important effects on at least two issues .",
    "the first is the jet power . in powerful flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , if there is one cold proton per emitting lepton , then the jet is dominated by the bulk kinetic power of protons , @xmath12 .",
    "if instead there are @xmath13 leptons per proton , @xmath12 can be reduced by the factor @xmath14 .",
    "the second issue concerns the acceleration mechanism .",
    "shocks and reconnection processes are thought to accelerate both leptons and protons .",
    "if the number of proton equals the number of leptons , at least half of the available energy goes to protons . instead",
    ", if pairs are present , most of the energy can go to leptons .",
    "the total power budget of the jet can be reduced by the presence of pairs , and the aim of the present study is to explore the possibility to create pairs ( through the @xmath0@xmath15 process ) in the inner zone of the jet , where the plasma is still accelerating and the bulk lorentz factor @xmath10 is small .",
    "the pairs that survive annihilation in this compact region can then refurnish the zone that produces the bulk of the radiation we see from blazars , characterized by a larger @xmath10 .",
    "if this mechanism is common , there is a clear observational consequence : misaligned sources , i.e. powerful radio  galaxies and lobe dominated quasars , should be strong emitters in the hard x  ray to soft @xmath0ray region .",
    "this is the diagnostic feature that provides the observational test for this scenario .",
    "the notation @xmath16 ( in cgs units ) is adopted .",
    "the most likely mechanism for the acceleration of extragalactic jets is through the conversion of an initially dominant poynting flux into kinetic power . in the inner jet , at a few  radii , the jet is still heavily magnetically dominated .",
    "if some dissipation occurs , accelerating electrons to relativistic energies , the resulting luminosity should be emitted by synchrotron radiation , with severe radiative losses .",
    "it is then likely that the emitting particles can not reach high energies , and their highest emitted synchrotron frequency is well below the pair production threshold .",
    "therefore most of the high energy emission must be produced through the inverse compton process .    in the inner jet",
    "the bulk lorentz factor must be relatively small , since the jet is just starting to accelerate .",
    "this implies that the radiation produced externally to the jet ( in the disk , the corona , the broad line region ) is not seen largely boosted in the comoving frame ( see fig . 2 of ghisellini & tavecchio 2009 , gt09 hereafter ) .",
    "in turn this implies that most of the radiation of the inner jet is produced by the synchrotron process , unless it is self  absorbed . to produce a large amount of pairs we have these alternatives :    1 .",
    "the synchrotron flux itself extends up to mev energies .",
    "this implies the presence of very energetic electrons , which is problematic because radiative cooling , in these regions , is very severe .",
    "most of the synchrotron flux is optically thin , produced by electrons with energies reaching @xmath17 .",
    "one or two inverse compton orders are enough to reach 1 mev . since the region is magnetically dominated , we expect a large ratio between the magnetic and radiation energy density , so that the synchrotron self ",
    "compton flux is at most comparable with the synchrotron luminosity .",
    "most of the synchrotron flux is self absorbed , corresponding to small electron energies . in this case",
    "the high energy flux is produced by multiple scatterings .",
    "most of the luminosity can not be emitted through the synchrotron process , which is self  absorbed , and is emitted through the comptonization process .",
    "sikora & madejski ( 2000 ) considered yet another process to produce a significant luminosity at @xmath18mev energies , through the interaction of coronal x  ray photons with cold leptons in the inner part of the jet ( i.e. the  protojet \" ) .",
    "these interactions boost the original x ",
    "ray photons to mev energies , i.e. above threshold .",
    "the mev photons are then absorbed and produce pairs ; a fraction of these pairs can then load the protojet .    since there are several ways to generate the required mev luminosity , it is convenient not to specify its origin .",
    "we will therefore explore the observational consequences of the existence of a mev luminosity large enough to produce enough pairs to feed the jet regions where most of the observed luminosity is produced .",
    "we will then assume that in a conical jet of semi  aperture angle @xmath19 , a region located at a distance @xmath20 from the black hole produces an observed luminosity @xmath21 , and that a fraction @xmath22 of it is converted into electron positron pairs .",
    "we will assume that the inner jet is accelerating according to @xmath23 \\label{gbeta}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the  radius and @xmath10 is the final bulk lorentz factor .",
    "the pair production process depends on the intrinsic compactness of the source , defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 $ ] is the doppler relativistic factor at @xmath20 and @xmath27 is the viewing angle .",
    "the fraction @xmath22 depends on @xmath28 and on its spectrum . for @xmath29 and for @xmath30",
    "spectra peaking in the mev region , @xmath22 reaches its maximum , which is nearly 0.1 ( svensson 1987 ) . if the spectrum peaks at energies much larger than 1 mev most of the absorbed energy is not transformed into rest mass of pairs , but in their kinetic energy , which is radiated away .",
    "therefore the conversion efficiency is less . to maximize @xmath22",
    ", we will assume that the spectrum indeed peaks at @xmath18mev energies , but take into account the dependence of @xmath22 on the compactness .",
    "since the latter measures the optical depth for the pair production process , which becomes larger than unity for @xmath31 , we simply have ( svensson 1987 ) : @xmath32   \\label{f}\\ ] ] the pair production rate @xmath33 is then @xmath34 if the optical depth of the created pairs is @xmath35 , annihilation is negligible in one dynamical timescale ( the time required for the region to expand doubling its radius ) and we have @xmath36 instead , when @xmath37 , annihilation is faster than the dynamical timescale , bringing the optical depth of the surviving pairs close to unity ( ghisellini et al . 1992 ) , giving @xmath38 at @xmath20 a density @xmath39 of pairs that survive annihilation is produced .",
    "these pairs , traveling along the jet , do not suffer further annihilation , because their optical depth decreases .",
    "then they reach the region located at @xmath40 , where they are accelerated and produce a fraction of the flux we observed from a blazar .",
    "we want to estimate their contribution to the observed flux .",
    "assuming number flux conservation , the density of pairs reaching the region where most of the blazar luminosity is produced is @xmath41 ^ 2 \\ , { \\gamma_0\\beta_0 \\over \\gamma\\beta } \\label{nn}\\ ] ] let us assume that all these pairs , when reaching @xmath42 , are accelerated to relativistic energies , and form a particle density distribution @xmath43 as a result of continuous injection and radiative cooling .",
    "the observed luminosity produced by pairs is : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the volume of the emitting region , and @xmath46 is the corresponding doppler factor .",
    "if the emitting region is within the broad line region , located at a distance @xmath47 from the black hole , the radiation energy density of the line photons is , as observed in the comoving frame : @xmath48 this assumes that @xmath49 cm , and that @xmath50 ( gt09 ; @xmath51 is the disk luminosity ) .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath52 , the external radiation energy density is constant and independent of @xmath53 . in powerful blazars",
    "this radiation energy density dominates over the energy density of internally produced synchrotron photons .",
    "thus the contribution of pairs to the @xmath0ray luminosity , due to inverse compton ( ic ) , is : @xmath54 with these assumptions @xmath55 becomes : @xmath56 the factor @xmath57 depends on the particle distribution .",
    "since the observed high energy spectrum is peaked at a frequency @xmath58 , the @xmath59 distribution must be a broken power law , with a break at @xmath60 where we have assumed the @xmath61 as the typical frequency of the seed photons ( that are observed blueshifted by a factor @xmath62 in the comoving frame ) .",
    "-0.5 cm -0.5 cm -0.3 cm    the strong radiative cooling in powerful blazars implies that even low energy leptons cool in one light crossing time .",
    "this ensures that the low energy part of @xmath59 can not be flatter than @xmath63 . and indeed the x  ray spectrum in these sources is often characterized by a power law with a slope @xmath64 , with @xmath65 , corresponding to @xmath66 . as a rough estimate",
    ", we then have @xmath67 then the contribution of pairs to the observed @xmath0ray luminosity is @xmath68 in principle , we can have three regimes : i ) at very low values of the intrinsic @xmath69 , the production of pairs is not  saturated \" ( i.e. the @xmath70 optical depth for pair production is less than unity , and @xmath71 ) and , furthermore , @xmath72 . in this case @xmath73 .",

    "the luminosity produced at @xmath42 is dominating at all frequencies if the viewing angle is small , is comparable to the luminosity produced at @xmath20 for @xmath94 , and becomes unobservable for @xmath91 or larger .",

    "if all these pairs are accelerated and emit , they would be enough to account for the entire radiation produced at @xmath42 .",

    "for the latter quantity we give two values : the first is assuming that there is one proton per lepton , while for the second there is only one proton every 20 leptons .",

    "the kinetic power @xmath102 increases .",
    "we alert the reader that what shown here is only an illustrative example .",
    "there can be several factors affecting the exact values of the used parameters .",

    "fig . [ inout ] shows that if the inner jet is the producer of the pairs that feed the @xmath42 regions of the jet , then its luminosity must be rather large and not strongly beamed .",
    "this statement is rather general _ and independent of the specific adopted model . _    as a consequence , misaligned blazars should be very strong hard x  ray sources ( if their inner jet produce pairs copiously ) .",
    "if this scenario is correct , then powerful fsrqs , observed to emit @xmath104 erg s@xmath2 , should have misaligned counterparts emitting at a level of @xmath92 erg s@xmath2 around 1 mev .",

    "this is not far from the sensitivities of current hard x  ray instruments , such as the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard the _ swift _ satellite ( ajello et al . 2009 ; 2012 ) , and reachable ( albeit at lower energies ) in even short exposures by the _",
    "nu  star _ satellite ( harrison et al .",
    "2005 ) . as a consequence",
    ", this scenario can be tested : if the inner jet regions produce pairs to feed the outer dissipation jet region , then misaligned radio loud agns should be strong emitters in the very hard x  ray range .",
    "the luminosity of this @xmath18 mev emission should be related to the @xmath0ray luminosity produced at @xmath42 , but the latter is visible only in aligned objects , not in radio  galaxies and lobe  dominated quasars .",
    "conversely , in aligned object we do not see the radiation produced at @xmath20 .",
    "we need an isotropic component visible in both classes of objects , that is related to the jet power , hence to the @xmath0ray luminosity of blazars . there can be two options .",

    "the latter could be measured by the broad emission lines .",
    "their luminosity gives a good estimate of the entire disk emission , hence of the mass accretion rate , hence of the jet power , hence of the @xmath0ray luminosity of an aligned source ( i.e. a blazars , see e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ; sbarrato et al .",

    ": suppose that a radio  galaxy ( or a lobe  dominated quasar ) is found to emit @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 at @xmath181 mev .",

    "the accretion disk should then be a factor 10 more luminous , so @xmath107 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this is , very approximately , of the order of the power @xmath108 carried by the jet in the form of radiation ( celotti & ghisellini 2008 ; gt09 ) , where @xmath109 is the observed jet bolometric luminosity .",
    "if the latter is dominated by @xmath110 , we expect @xmath111 erg s@xmath2 ( with an uncertainty of several ) .",
    "we then conclude ( see fig .",
    "[ test ] ) that indeed the inner jet of the misaligned agn could produce enough pairs to sustain the expected @xmath0ray luminosity of its aligned counterpart . with these ( admittedly very rough ) arguments , we can relate the luminosity of the inner jets of radio  galaxies and lobe  dominated quasars with the @xmath0ray luminosities that would be seen by an aligned observer .",
    "electron  positron pairs can not be produced in the same region where most of the @xmath0ray luminosity of blazars is emitted , but there are no strong arguments against their creation in the inner part of the jet ( at @xmath112 ) , where the bulk lorentz factor is small .",
    "the pairs that survive annihilation can feed larger regions of the jet ( the  @xmath0ray zone \" at @xmath113 ) , and be re  accelerated there , to contribute significantly to the emission we see from blazars .",
    "the most efficient way to create pairs in the inner jet is through photon ",
    "photon collisions , requiring a relatively large luminosity peaked around 1 mev .",
    "since in these regions the bulk lorentz factor is small , and the corresponding beaming angle is large , these large luminosities are observable in nearby misaligned sources , i.e. radio  galaxies .",
    "this is the observational test of the scenario : if a substantial number of pairs are contributing to the luminosity of powerful blazars , than powerful radio  galaxies should be strong hard x  ray emitters .",
