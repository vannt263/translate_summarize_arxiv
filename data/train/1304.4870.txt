    "we notice that the difference between the @xmath61-like and @xmath62-like event distributions in the sk experiment  @xcite can be explained by the matter effect on @xmath63 which travel through the earth .",

    "the minos result for the amplitude of the muon neutrino oscillations  @xcite , which is close to unity , is explained by the muon neutrino oscillations to both electron neutrino and tau neutrino , where the matter effect plays subdominant role . for the survival probability of the muon neutrino we have @xmath84 with the vacuum oscillation phase @xmath85 l[\\text{km } ] } { e[\\text{gev}]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",

    "thousands of @xmath90 solar neutrinos were detected by sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno )  @xcite using the charged - current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) reactions @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "the ratio of the neutrino fluxes measured with cc and nc events is  @xcite @xmath93    for the solar neutrinos with the energies @xmath94  mev the oscillations due to @xmath95 proceed in the matter of the sun as in vacuum , since the number density of electrons in the center of the sun is by a factor of 10 smaller than the  resonance density \" in eq .",

    "with @xmath95 , we have @xmath98  km . for the earth - sun distance",
    "@xmath99  km we have @xmath100 ( this relation is satisfied for the neutrino mass splittings down to @xmath101  ev@xmath53 , which sets the lower bound for the violation of the degeneracy in the neutrino mass spectrum in eq .   without spoiling the result in eq .  .",
    ") in this limit eq .   is reduced to the simple incoherent form @xmath102 ( moreover the oscillations should be averaged out already due to the lack of the emitter localization  @xcite . ) hence @xmath103 and , using eq .  , we have @xmath104 which is in good agreement with the experimental data in eq .  .",
    "we remark that the suppression of @xmath63 flux in eq .",
    "is independent of their energy .",
    "this provides an efficient tool for examination of the solar model calculations , since the neutrino fluxes are quite sensitive to their parameter variations .",
    "for example , the predictions of the solar models with late accretion for @xmath105b , @xmath106be and @xmath107 neutrino fluxes differ by 400% , 300% and 20% , respectively , see fig .  12 in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "we notice that the explanation of kamland experimental data by the neutrino oscillations with the mass splitting @xmath108  ev@xmath53  @xcite is questionable  ev@xmath53 .",
    "] , and at least one independent experiment is needed to verify the kamland result .",
    "using eqs .   and , the average mass , determined through the analysis of low energy beta decays , can be written as @xmath109 for @xmath110  ev we have @xmath111  ev , which is far below the present upper limit @xmath112  ev ( at 95% cl ) obtained in the  troitsk neutrino mass \" experiment  @xcite , and below the sensitivity @xmath113  ev ( at 90% cl ) of ongoing katrin experiment  @xcite .",
    "however the new approaches such as the mare , echo , and project8 experiments , offer the promise to perform an independent measurement of the neutrino mass in the sub - ev region  @xcite .",
    "using eqs .   and , the effective majorana mass in @xmath114 decay can be written as @xmath115 hence @xmath114 decay is strongly suppressed and practically unobservable in the discussed model , which can be checked to very good precision in possible future ton - scale experiments , e.g. , genius  @xcite , lxe 10ty and hpxe 10ty  @xcite .      the t2k experiment reported indication of electron neutrino appearance from an accelerator - produced off - axis muon neutrino beam  @xcite .",
    "the minos collaboration also reported @xmath116 appearance signal  @xcite .",
    "the discussed t2k ( minos ) experiment observed 6 ( 62 ) candidate @xmath63 events against the expected 1.5 ( 50 ) events for the case of no @xmath116 oscillation , which resulted from their analysis , in particular , in the upper bounds @xmath117 at the 90% cl on the amplitude of the oscillation probability written as @xmath118 more data is expected from ongoing and coming experiments such as nova  @xcite .",
    "several reactor experiments recently reported indications of electron antineutrino disappearance  @xcite with the ratios of observed to expected numbers of @xmath119 about @xmath120 , which yielded @xmath121 .",
    "the discussed values of the amplitude @xmath122 are smaller than the predictions , which can be derived from the theory of democratic neutrino oscillations , introduced in section  [ atmospheric neutrinos : oscillations ] .",
    "however these results are strongly model dependent . in particular",
    ", the uncertainties of the neutrino fluxes may have a significant effect , e.g. , reduction of @xmath123 by about 10% results in increase of @xmath122 by factor of 2.5 .",
    "therefore we strongly encourage the neutrino physicists to reanalyze the data in the framework of the presented simple and natural theory .",
    "we hope that this will bring the neutrino theory and experiment to a good agreement without introduction of sterile neutrinos or other exotics .",
    "we introduced a simple model , which may explain the confirmed neutrino data , and resolve the long standing neutrino mass puzzles .",
    "this model is based on the non - diagonal  democratic \" mass matrix of three majorana neutrinos , and predicts degenerate neutrino mass splittings , which govern the atmospheric neutrino oscillations , and result in the neutrino mass spectrum close to \\{0.03 , 0.03 , 0.06}(ev ) .",
    "the difference between @xmath61-like and @xmath62-like event distributions in the super - kamiokande is controlled by the matter effect .",
    "the solar neutrino deficit is explained by their incoherence in the earth .",
    "we outlined the predictions for the direct neutrino mass and the neutrinoless double beta decay experiments , and importance of the accelerator @xmath116 oscillation and the reactor @xmath119 disappearance experiments in verification of the considered model . definitely more detailed and careful analysis of the neutrino data with respect to the considered model",
