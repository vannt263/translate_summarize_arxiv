    "few - particle systems with resonant interactions ( characterized by a large two - particle scattering length @xmath0 greatly exceeding the interaction range ) exhibit universal behaviour .",
    "their properties are independent of the short - range interaction details .",
    "the theoretical study of such systems was initiated by v. efimov in 1970 who predicted the existence of weakly bound three - particle states ( efimov trimers ) with asymptotic discrete scaling symmetry @xcite .",
    "the interest in the universal few - particle systems raised after the efimov s prediction got confirmed in the cold - atom physics experiments @xcite . in the present work we summarize some recent theoretical developments for the universal system of four identical bosons .",
    "the existence of two tetramers below each efimov trimer was predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite while their energies and widths were determined very precisely in refs .",
    "the resulting four - boson energy ( @xmath1 ) spectrum as function of @xmath2 is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efi ] ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for quantitative relations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 that , for a better visualisation , are not preserved here ) .",
    "the above - mentioned tetramers are labeled as @xmath3 where @xmath4 refers to the associated efimov trimer and @xmath5 . in the present work we focus on a different type of tetramers , namely , the ones having an approximate dimer - atom - atom structure and labeled as @xmath6 .",
    "their existence was predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite as a consequence of the three - body efimov effect in the three - body system made off a dimer and two atoms . in a special regime near the efimov trimer intersection with the atom - dimer threshold",
    "the atom - dimer scattering length becomes arbitrarily large and greatly exceeds the dimer size . under these circumstances",
    "one may expect to mimic some properties of the few - boson systems using a model that considers the dimer as a pointlike particle .",
    "then in the effective three - body system consisting of a dimer and two atoms there are two atom - dimer pairs with infinite two - body scattering length .",
    "in such a three - body model of the four - boson system the three - body efimov effect occurs , however , with a very large discrete scaling factor @xcite .",
    "the dimer - atom - atom structure of the resulting efimov - like states is only an approximation , and we present the first successful attempt @xcite to describe them rigorously as four - boson states . since they lie in the continuum , we use scattering equations for the four - particle transition operators . for a given efimov trimer",
    "the universal properties of the lowest associated tetramer @xmath7 are determined and its impact on the collisions in the four - boson system is discussed .",
    "furthermore , using the same technical framework we study the recombination processes in the four - boson system , i.e. , the four - boson recombination into atom plus trimer @xcite and dimer - atom - atom recombination into atom plus trimer or dimer plus dimer @xcite .",
    "we employ alt , grassberger , and sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite for the transition operators that provide an exact description of the four - particle scattering process . in the case of four identical particles",
    "there are only two distinct two - cluster partitions , one of @xmath8 type and one of @xmath9 type .",
    "we choose those partitions to be ( 12,3)4 and ( 12)(34 ) and denote them in the following by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding transition operators @xmath12 for the system of four identical bosons obey symmetrized ags equations    [ eq : u ] @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the free green s function of the four - particle system with energy @xmath1 and kinetic energy operator @xmath15 , the two - particle transition matrix @xmath16 acting within the pair ( 12 ) is derived from the corresponding potential @xmath17 , and the symmetrized operators for the 3 + 1 and 2 + 2 subsystems are obtained from the integral equations @xmath18 the employed basis states have to be symmetric under exchange of two particles in subsystem ( 12 ) for the @xmath8 partition and in ( 12 ) and ( 34 ) for the @xmath9 partition .",
    "the correct symmetry of the four - boson system is ensured by the operators @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the permutation operator of particles @xmath0 and @xmath23 .",
    "all observables for two - cluster reactions are determined by the transition amplitudes @xmath24 obtained @xcite as on - shell matrix elements of the ags operators ; the weight factors @xmath25 with values @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 arise due to the symmetrization @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements are calculated between the faddeev components @xmath30 of the corresponding initial / final atom - trimer or dimer - dimer states @xmath31 .",
    "the amplitude for the three - cluster breakup of the initial two - cluster state is given @xcite by @xmath32    @xmath33 and @xmath34 and the dimer - atom - atom three - cluster channel state @xmath35 .",
    "due to the time - reversal symmetry the three - cluster recombination into a two - cluster state is described by the same amplitude , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "the amplitude for the four - cluster breakup can be obtained @xcite as @xmath37    t \\ , g_0     u_1 g_0 \\ , t \\ , g_0 \\ , { \\mathcal{u}}_{1\\alpha } \\\\ { } & +   ( 1+p_2 ) t \\ , g_0     u_2 g_0 \\ ,",
    ", g_0 \\ , { \\mathcal{u}}_{2\\alpha } \\ }    \\end{split}\\ ] ] with @xmath38 and @xmath39 and the nonsymmetrized four - boson free - channel state @xmath40 .",
    "again , due to the time - reversal symmetry the amplitude for the four - boson recombination into a two - cluster state is given by @xmath41 .",
    "we solve the ags equations in the momentum - space partial - wave framework ; the technical details can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "to obtain universal results we consider reactions involving highly excited efimov trimers where the finite - range effects become negligible ; typically , @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath7 tetramer emerges at the @xmath4th atom - trimer threshold at the two - boson scattering length @xmath43 with @xmath44 corresponding to the intersection of atom - trimer and atom - atom - dimer thresholds . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this tetramer stays very close to the @xmath4th atom - trimer threshold and decays through the atom - atom - dimer threshold at @xmath45 .",
    "the higher tetramers @xmath46 exist only extremely close to @xmath47 and can not be resolved in our four - boson calculations ; estimations based on the three - body model are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the intersections of the tetramers with the @xmath4th atom - trimer threshold manifest themselves most prominently in the collisions of atoms and trimers at vanishing relative kinetic energy leading to the resonant behaviour of the corresponding atom - trimer ( @xmath4th ) scattering length @xmath48 .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] as a function of the two - boson scattering length @xmath0 .",
    "here we use @xmath49 to build universal dimensionless ratios ; this special value of @xmath0 corresponds to the intersection of the @xmath4th atom - trimer and dimer - dimer thresholds .",
    "the @xmath48 resonance at @xmath50 is due to the @xmath7 tetramer .",
    "the increase of @xmath51 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] near @xmath52 is not related to the tetramers ; it is due to the scaling of the elastic cross section with the spatial size of the trimer that grows with decreasing binding relative to the atom - dimer threshold .",
    "the @xmath48 resonances at @xmath53 and @xmath54 correspond to the disappearance and reappearance of the @xmath55 tetramer as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efi ] .",
    "the explanation for such a spectacular behaviour of the @xmath55 tetramer may be the following : increasing @xmath2 , i.e. , increasing the strength of the two - boson interaction , the binding energies increase for all few - boson states but at different rates .",
    "the increase is faster for the dimer , slower for the trimers , and even slower for the tetramers .",
    "this is why the @xmath4th trimer decays through the atom - dimer threshold at @xmath47 , and the @xmath55 tetramer , having a structure of an atom weakly attached to the trimer , decays through the atom - trimer threshold at @xmath56 , becoming an inelastic virtual state ( ivs ) .",
    "however , when the the @xmath4th atom - trimer and dimer - dimer thresholds are close to each other , the interference of the atom - trimer and dimer - dimer configurations in the @xmath55 tetramer yield additional binding such that the tetramer becomes an unstable bound state until it finally decays through the dimer - dimer threshold @xcite .",
    "the number of the four - atom recombination events in a non - degenerated atomic gas per volume and time is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the density of atoms and @xmath59 is the four - atom recombination rate .",
    "its relation to the breakup / recombination amplitude is given in ref .",
    "the zero - temperature limit of the four - atom recombination rate @xmath60 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k4 ] as a function of the two - boson scattering length .",
    "the special value of @xmath61 corresponds to the @xmath4th efimov trimer being at the three free atom threshold .",
    "the two peaks of @xmath60 at @xmath62 and @xmath63 correspond to the @xmath64 and @xmath55 tetramers being at the four free atom threshold , respectively .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results for the dimer - atom - atom recombination reactions leading to the atom - trimer or dimer - dimer final states are presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we studied the dimer - atom - atom three - body efimov effect using rigorous four - particle scattering equations for the transition operators that were solved in the momentum - space framework .",
    "we determined the properties of the deepest resulting tetramers and demonstrated that in ultracold atom - trimer collisions they lead to resonant enhancement of elastic and inelastic reactions .",
    "furthermore , we considered three- and four - cluster recombination reactions in the universal four - boson system and presented results for the ultracold four - boson recombination ."
