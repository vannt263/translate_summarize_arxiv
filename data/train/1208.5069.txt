    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are among the most energetic explosions in the known universe , releasing @xmath2 ergs of kinetic energy in their ejecta , and synthesizing @xmath3 @xmath0  of radioactive @xmath4ni .",
    "the discovery of the phillips relation @xcite enabled the use of sne  ia  as standardizable cosmological candles , and has ushered in a new era of astronomy leading to the discovery of the acceleration of the universe @xcite , and to the 2011 nobel prize in physics .",
    "models of normal sne  ia , such as the single degenerate ( sd ) model , focus on exploding the wd in order to produce the explosion energies , luminosities , and typical velocities observed in normal sne  ia .",
    "this is accomplished either by consuming enough of the wd with the initial subsonic buring phase  or deflagration phase  to unbind the wd as theorized by the pure deflagration ( pd ) model , or consuming the entire wd by a detonation triggered by the deflagration phase as posited by the deflagration - to - detonation transition ( ddt ) , the pulsating reverse detonation ( prd ) @xcite , and the gcd @xcite models of sne  ia .    in the following , we present a novel variant of sd model of sne  ia  in which the deflagration is too weak to unbind the star and a detonation is not triggered by any of the proposed mechansisms , resulting in the survival of a bound remnant of the original wd .",
    "we present for the first time predictions of these failed - detonation ( fd ) sne from 2d and 3d simulations .",
    "we show that fd models have numerous remarkable implications for the observable properties of the resulting explosion and its outcomes .",
    "these include the production of a family of peculiar sne  ia  events with low expansion velocities , low luminosities and low ejecta - mass  whose properties are broadly consistent with the observed properties of a branch of peculiar sne  ia  similar to sn 2002cx and/or sn 2008 ha . even more remarkably , the remnant wd receives a large velocity kick from the asymmetric nature of the deflagration , and is enriched with both intermediate - mass ( ime s ) and iron - group elements ( ige s ) , forming a peculiar wd with a heavey / iron - rich core .",
    "previous work has suggested that though the pd model has shortcomings explaining normal sne  ia , they may explain 2002cx - like sne @xcite .",
    "the wd , however , is fully incinerated in these models , producing a chandrasekhar - mass of ejecta .",
    "such models might therefore not be able to explain the large diversity recently observed among sne of this peculiar class of sne .",
    "additionally , a study by @xcite of initial conditions for the pd model produced situations that they termed `` fizzles '' which did not produce a healthy pd explosion and left the wd bound .",
    "they did not pursue these models beyond the scope of their study , nor did they relate these fizzles to peculiar sne  ia .",
    "the fd scenario requires that no detonation is triggered as a result of the deflagration event .",
    "we briefly touch on the possibility of the prd and gcd failing to trigger a detonation .",
    "we first make the general assumption that is made in the pd , prd , and gcd scenarios , namely that the ddt mechanism is not active .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a discussion of the justification of this assumption , the details of which are beyond the scope of this work .    in the prd model , ash ejected during the deflagration phase falls back onto the wd .",
    "an accretion shock formed by infalling ash surrounds and heats fuel remaining in the wd core , which in turn triggers a detonation .",
    "@xcite reported that the prd could not trigger a detonation if the energy released during the deflagration was near that of the binding energy of the wd .",
    "this situation is realized in our simulations .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter j12 ) detail how the gcd mechanism triggers a gradient - induced detonation when ash from the deflagration flows over the stellar surface , mixes with cold fuel , collides at the antipodal point from break out , and is squeezed to the necessary temperatures and densities by the contracting wd .",
    "models presented here show that a detonation via the gcd mechanism is avoided alltogether .",
    "the primary difference between these models and those of j12  is the amount of energy released during the deflagration .",
    "more energy is released and delivered to the wd than in j12 ; thus , more mass is consumed by the flame and ejected from the wd than previously .",
    "the wd is modified to a higher degree and as a result the wd can not contract enough to squeeze the fuel - ash mixture to the critical conditions for detonation . therefore the star never detonates .",
    "we note that @xcite also investigated the failure of the gcd mechanism ; however , their simulations in which the wd was still bound and star did not detonate were stopped before the contraction phase .",
    "j12  discussed these models and showed that had @xcite run their simulations longer , they would have most likely triggered a gcd on contraction .",
    "the fd scenario thus occurs when a weak deflagration leaves a partially bound wd ( in constrast to the pd model ) and the conditions for detonation are never realized ( and the ddt is avoided ) .",
    "we used the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) flash application framework @xcite to perform our simulations of fd models .",
    "flash has been previously used to simulate sne  ia  in both 2d cylindrical and 3d cartesian geometry ( @xcite , j12 ) .",
    "our simulations include an advection - diffusion - reaction ( adr ) treatment of the thermonuclear flame @xcite , an equation of state that includes contributions from blackbody radiation , ions , and electrons of an arbitrary degree of degeneracy @xcite , and the multipole treatment of gravity @xcite .    we performed four 3-dimensional ( 3d ) exploratory simulations to test the feasibility of the fd and 1 full 2-dimensional ( 2d ) model to adequately observe the fd at late times .",
    "our 3d simulations included a reduced domain size and a moderate resolution ( 8 km ) which reduced their computational expense .",
    "we initialized these simulations similarly to those in j12with a 1.365 @xmath0  wd placed at the origin of the domain .",
    "we used the same distribution of sixty three , @xmath5 km radius ignition `` points '' distributed in a @xmath6 km radius spherical volume .",
    "we chose 48 km , 38 , km , 28 km , and 18 km as offset distances along the z - axis of the spherical volume .",
    "note that these offsets are closer to the wd core than in j12  and lead to more buring during the deflagration phase .",
    "table [ tab : sims ] lists the initial conditions for each simulation and the corresponding names we gave them .",
    "we ran the simulations from ignition , through peak stellar expansion , and at least until the wd reached a maximum central density upon contraction .",
    "our 2d simulation was performed with a large domain in 2d cylindrical geometry at 4 km resolution and ran for 60 seconds .",
    "this simulation was initialized similarly to the 3d simulations except we placed only 4 bubbles in a 64 km spherical volume offset by 70 km along the z - axis ( axis of symmetry ) .",
    "we chose these initial conditions to obtain an fd in 2d given what we learned from our 3d simulations .",
    "the larger domain size allowed us to follow the outer layers of the ejecta for the entirety of the simulation .",
    "we obtained an fd from each of our simulations .",
    "table [ tab : sims ] contains a collection of their properties .",
    "the deflagration liberated between 89% and 167% of the binding energy of the wd .",
    "however , in each simulation the deflagration fails to unbind the wd .",
    "the wd expands in response to the deflagration , reaches its maximum level of expansion , and then contracts .",
    "figure [ fig : rhocvstime ] shows the evolution of the central density , @xmath7 , of the wd and illustrates the oscillatory nature of the wd after the deflagration . the more energy released during the deflagration , the more the star expanded , the longer the pulsational period , and the smaller @xmath7  at maximum contraction .",
    "the fact that the deflagration releases more than 100% wd binding energy in some models suggests that the wd should be unbound after the deflagration ; however , the entire energy budget does not work to only unbind the star . for example , some of the energy is lost when the ejecta and the remnant wd are accelerated to high velocities .",
    "even though the deflagration liberates enough energy to completely unbind the star , the energy is partitioned in such a way that a portion of the original wd remains gravitationally bound .    in each of our models ,",
    "the wd gets a kick in the opposite direction from which the buoyant ash rises and breaks through the surface of the star .",
    "we measured this velocity to be on the order of hundreds of km s@xmath1and list these values for each simulation in table [ tab : sims ] .",
    "we note that momentum conservation is better than 10% of the momentum of the wd kick in our simulations .",
    "some of the material from the fd escapes and achieves high velocities , while some of the material is bound to the remnant wd and will eventually accrete onto its surface .",
    "table [ tab : sims ] lists the composition of material that remains gravitationally bound and eventually will mix with the remnant wd . in all cases between 0.04 @xmath0  and 0.2 @xmath0  of ime s and ige s ( some of which is radioactive @xmath4ni ) remained bound to the star .",
    "the evolution of the wd as the material falls back onto and heats the star is an interesting question and one which we will examine in future work .",
    "the composition of the material that escapes the system is also listed in table [ tab : sims ] along with the kinetic energy and the mass - weighted velocity of the ejecta .",
    "this material includes carbon and oxygen , ime s , and ige s , and ranges from 0.2 to 1.0 @xmath0 .",
    "in general , the more material that is burned during the deflagration , the more material that escapes .",
    "figure [ fig : combo ] shows shows the density structure and composition with overlaid velocity contours of the 2d model at 60s .",
    "note that the density profile of the fd model is asymmetric in velocity space between the hemisphere corresponding to the ejected deflagration and the opposite hemisphere of the system .",
    "the remnant of the wd can be seen as the tiny high - density feature slightly below the origin of the domain .",
    "the figure also shows the nature of the asymmetry in composition of the structure . the north side of the remnant contains the products of the deflagration that were sprayed from the surface of the wd .",
    "clumpy structures of ime s and ige s exist at a range of velocities in the northern hemisphere of the domain but are less abundant in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the asymmetries suggest that this object would look much different depending on the viewing angle of the observer .",
    "all of our models produce a relatively small amount of radioactive @xmath4ni .",
    "though we do not perform detailed nucleosynthetic post processing of the 3d models , we can set an upper limit on the @xmath4ni  yields with the amount of ige s produced , which ranges from 0.2 @xmath0  to 0.34 @xmath0 .",
    "neutronization through electron capture reactions during the deflagration would shift production away from @xmath4ni though and reduce its contribution to the ige totals .",
    "whether even lower masses of ige s ( and thus @xmath4ni ) could be produced under appropriate conditions ( e.g. comparable to that observed in sn 2008 ha , a very faint sn with extremely low ejecta velocities ) , is yet to be explored .    in summary , we find that a remnant of the wd survives the fd sn event with a lower mass than the original .",
    "the remaining bound stellar material is kicked by the ejection of the ash and obtains a velocity of hundreds of km s@xmath1 .",
    "an asymmetric outburst of deflagration products rich in ige s ( such as fe , co , and ni ) and containing some ime s ( such as mg , si , and s ) is produced .",
    "some of this material attains escape velocity and some falls back onto the star .",
    "the velocity of the escapting outflow was slow ( approximately a few thousand km s@xmath1 ) related to normal sne  ia  as a result of the comparatively small amount of energy released in the fd scenario . due to the weak nature of the deflagration ,",
    "the fd only converted 15% and 25% of the wd to @xmath4ni , compared to normal sne  ia  which convert nearly half of the wd to @xmath4ni .",
    "finally , the collection of simulations we present produces a range of values for each of the discussed properties which suggests a population of events within this class of model .",
    "the most prominent features of the fd models are the low mass and low velocity of the ejecta , which translate into the production of typically sub - luminous , low - velocity sne  ia .",
    "it is therefore natural to examine whether sne with such characteristics have already been discovered . in particular",
    ", one may explore peculiar sne exhibiting either extremely low mass ejecta , such as sn 2008 ha @xcite , or low ejecta velocity such as sn 2002cx - like sne @xcite .",
    "normal sne  ia  differ in their ejecta velocities as measured in some standard method , but they generally fall between @xmath8 km s@xmath1 near peak luminosity , with similar dispersion at later times ( as derived from the si ii line @xcite ) .",
    "the velocities of even the lowest velocity sne in the @xcite sample much exceed the mass - averaged fd velocities listed in table [ tab : sims ] .",
    "we also note a trend in our simulations of more energetic and likely more luminous ( larger ige yield ) sne to be accompanied by higher ejecta - velocities over almost an order of magnitude in kinetic energy .",
    "the only other type of sne with such low expansion velocities are the branch of peculiar type ia sne , named for the prototype for this class of supernovae , 2002cx @xcite ; such sne may also have an energy - velocity correlation @xcite as observed in our simulations .",
    "sn 2002cx - like events are characterized by luminosities which lie too low in comparison to the phillips relation for branch - normal ia events @xcite , low photospheric velocities @xcite , weak intermediate - mass element lines @xcite , and late - time optical nebular spectra dominated by narrow fe ii lines @xcite . since the discovery of sn 2002cx",
    ", a number of other 2002cx - like events have been discovered , including 2002es , 2005p , 2005hk @xcite , 2008ge @xcite and 2008 ha @xcite . the latter event ( sn 2008 ha ) , in particular , is consistent with extremely low mass ejecta and energetics .",
    "we predict the fd models to produce similar properties to those characterizing sn 2002cx like sne , given the low expansion velocities and the low estimated @xmath4ni yield , and potentially even explaining sn 2008 ha like events with low mass ejecta .    though our initial set of simulations is limited , the robust features of fd s , including low velocity ejecta , the expected low luminosity ( due to the small yield of @xmath4ni ) and their low mass ejecta ( comparable to that sn 2008 ha ) make them tantalizing candidate progenitors for this branch of peculiar sne .",
    "note that the single degenerate origin of such sne is also consistent with the overall typically young ( but not _ necessarily _ young ; @xcite 2010 ) environments found for sn-2002cx like sne , compared to the expectations from , e.g. core - collapse sne ( only very young environments ) .",
    "in our fd scenario , a large amount of burnt material falls back to the remnant wd . from table",
    "[ tab : sims ] , the wd may incorporate as much as @xmath9 @xmath0 of ige s and @xmath10 @xmath0 of ime s of fallback material , together comprising as much as @xmath11 of the remnant c - o wd . in time , these elements are likely to gravitationally settle to the wd core , creating wd s with iron - rich / heavy core . the existence of iron - core wd s has been considered before , with even the potential observation of such wds @xcite . the fd scenario",
    "therefore provides a novel evolutionary scenario for the formation of these iron / heavy - core c - o wd s .",
    "a somewhat related scenario of failed sn was suggested for the formation of o - ne - mg wds with iron cores @xcite .",
    "fd s produce a highly asymmetric ejection of material .",
    "this is not unique amongst various models for sne explosions .",
    "however , in our fd case , the wd survives the explosion . considering momentum conservation ,",
    "this gives rise to a unique outcome , namely that the surviving wd is kicked at very high velocities , ranging hundreds of km s@xmath1 .",
    "the fd scenario suggests the existence of strong wd natal kicks , and provides an interesting prediction per the existence of hypervelocity wds .",
    "taken together , the potential existence of a a heavy core wd ( discussed in section [ subsec : fecores ] ) , and the high ejection velocity produce a highly peculiar object , which , if observed may provide a possibly unique smoking gun signature .",
    "one should note , however , that the population of halo wds may also have relatively high velocities , and it might therefore be difficult to pinpoint the kinematic property as related to a natal kick ( unless the wd is massive and young ; an unlikely possibility for the old population of halo wds ) .",
    "we note that velocities of hundreds of km s@xmath1 could be larger than the orbital velocities of the sn binary progenitor , and a kick velocity of such magnitude can therefore unbind the binary .",
    "various binary configurations have been explored for the single degenerate progenitor models , including progenitors with ms and rg companions @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the range of wd kick velocities could either unbind the binary ( more likely for wd - ms binaries ) , or leave behind a bound wd binary ( more likely for the wd - rg binaries ) .",
    "the latter case could lead to the formation of a very compact , but potentially eccentric wd - binary , which would be difficult to produce through other channels of binary evolution .",
    "our simulations demonstrate the properties of a scenario in which the deflagration is too weak to unbind the wd and the conditions to trigger a detonation are not met .",
    "these failed - detonations result in an asymmetric outburst of deflagration material consisting of ime s and ige s along with a fraction of the original wd still gravitationally bound .",
    "the models produce a family of faint sne  ia  with a slowly evolving light curves due to the low @xmath4ni  yield and the low energetics .",
    "the remaining wd gets a kick on the order of hundreds of km s@xmath1 and is contaminated with fall - back from the deflagration , producing a wd with an iron - rich / heavy core .",
    "we presented our initial simulations to quantify the some of the bulk observable properties and demonstrate the conditions under which the gcd fails .",
    "we further hypothesize that the fd model is a possible explanation for 2002cx - like sn .",
    "future studies will explore the detailed observational features of fd sne and their direct comparison to observations .",
