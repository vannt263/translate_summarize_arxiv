    "below we report the results of an experiment designed to measure the value of @xmath13 using direct lagrangian particle tracking in an elastic turbulence flow in a microfluidic tube . however , our measurements of pair dispersion show no evidence for the predicted exponential growth in time of the mean squared separation . to our great surprise , we have discovered that for a significant fraction of the observation time , the mean relative pair dispersion evolves quadratically to leading order in time @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , our data admits a scaling collapse , providing a convincing evidence that these observations are well - described by the short time expansion of the relative pair dispersion , the so called _ ballistic _ regime .",

    "these curves , together with the rest of the pairs which were found in each @xmath22 bin , were collected and the second moments were calculated to construct the datasets of @xmath23 presented in fig.[fig : normed_pair_dispersion ] on a semi - logarithmic scale , where an exponential curve would have appeared linear ( the un - normalised data @xmath24 can be found in fig.[fig : not_normed_pair_dispersion ] ; the sample size data is presented in fig.[fig : sample_size ] ) .",

    "nevertheless , no single slope , to be identified with @xmath9 in eq.[eq : exp_prediction ] , can be found .",
    "moreover , an exponential pair dispersion should extrapolate to the origin on this plot , and this is clearly not the case .",
    "to our great surprise we have found that , for a significant fraction of the observation time , the mean relative pair dispersion evolves quadratically in time to leading order @xmath18 ; this observation is evident in the insets of fig.[fig : short_time_behaviour_forward ] , and stands in sharp contradiction to the interpretations of recent experimental results @xcite . to better understand the source for this scaling let us write the taylor expansion around @xmath25 @xmath26",
    "substituting this in the expression for the relative pair dispersion and considering the ensemble average over pairs of the same initial separation @xmath27 we find that the leading order term at short times is indeed quadratic in @xmath28  the so - called _ ballistic _ regime .",
    "this is a universal property which does not require any assumptions on the character of the flow .",
    "a sign of this scaling beneath the dissipative scale has been observed in simulations of isotropic turbulence ( * ? ? ? * fig.5 ) . yet",
    "neither quantitative analysis of the coefficients in eq.[eq : relative_dispersion_taylor ] nor any contrast with the exponential separation prediction were made .",
    "other experimental @xcite and numerical @xcite results are limited to the inertial subrange of turbulence .    to test this",
    "further we rescale the relative pair dispersion by the pre - factor , the mean initial squared relative velocity @xmath29 . unlike the case of inertial turbulence , for elastic turbulence there are no exact results nor scaling arguments to derive the coefficients appearing in eq.[eq : relative_dispersion_taylor ] .",
    "therefore we extract them from the experimental data ; the @xmath29 profile as function of @xmath22 is presented in fig.[fig : uo2_ro_profile]_a_. indeed we find that our data admits a scaling collapse with no fitting parameters , providing a convincing experimental evidence that these observations are well - described by the short time expansion of the relative pair dispersion .",
    "the data shown in fig.[fig : short_time_behaviour_forward ] seem to deviate significantly from the quadratic scaling only after 23 seconds .",

    "are eliminated .",
    "the result , the time asymmetric contributions presented in fig.[fig : short_time_behaviour_backwards - forward ] , shows that indeed initially the next - to - leading order correction follows @xmath30 and that the curves do collapse onto one when rescaled by @xmath31 , the appropriate coefficient in eq.[eq : relative_dispersion_taylor ] .",
    "the values of @xmath32 were , once again , extracted from the experimental data ; see fig.[fig : a.u_ro_profile ] for the @xmath22 profile . however , the deviations from this scaling are noticeable earlier than half a second , much earlier than the deviations from the ballistic behaviour discussed above .",
    "this hints that the deviation observed in fig.[fig : short_time_behaviour_forward ] is in fact due to higher order terms , potentially an indication of a transition to another regime .",
    "the fact that the transition takes place at an earlier time for the larger initial separations indicates the potential effects of the vessel size and its geometry , as well as the failure of the linear flow approximation ; see fig.[fig : uo2_ro_profile ] .",
    "in the light of eq.[eq : relative_dispersion_taylor ] , the ballistic evolution at short times should not be too surprising . and",
    "yet , to our knowledge it has not been discussed experimentally , nor confronted with the exponential separation prediction . moreover ,",
    "the ` memory ' of the initial conditions in our data is longer than one may have expected . on the one hand ,",
    "our observations are consistent with the time - scale @xmath33 derived from the ratio of the coefficients in eq.[eq : relative_dispersion_taylor ] ( see fig.[fig : dt_star_ro_profile ] ) , as deviations from the @xmath34 scaling are expected to be noticeable for @xmath35 .",
    "this is also manifested in the rescaling of the data by @xmath33 , presented in fig.[fig : normalised_behaviour_forward ] , and to be compared with numerical simulations of inertial turbulence ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.1 ) . on the other hand , during the time the statistics are dominated by the initial conditions , single realisations are not monotonic nor predictable ( see fig.[fig : intro ] ) , that is to say , our observations are not a trivial result of the mean flow alone , which in itself is inhomogeneous . moreover , during one second tracers typically travel distances larger than the width of the tube .",
    "given the stochastic nature of the dynamics , the spatial structure of the flow and the limited range of the linear flow approximation ( see insets in fig.[fig : uo2_ro_profile ] ) , the taylor expansion in time eq.[eq : relative_dispersion_taylor ] was expected to have a rather restrictive radius of convergence .",
    "further analysis is required to clarify whether higher order terms are of importance and to estimate the lagrangian correlation time , which accounts for both the temporal and the spatial structure of the flow .",
    "hence , in - depth discussion of the transition away from the ballistic regime in our system is left for future work .    nonetheless , the time for which the ballistic approximation holds is longer than a second , a memory of the initial relative velocities which allows a wide prediction horizon .",
    "we are unaware of any previous discussion of pair dispersion short time statistics neither in the context of elastic turbulence nor for the broader class of wall - bounded viscous mixing flows .",
    "the implications are far - reaching  knowing the average velocity difference at a given scale , which is an eulerian property , one can determine the degree of dispersion , a lagrangian property , as was recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated its predictive power over a significant time interval , which provides a new paradigm for chaotic flows dominated by dissipation .",
    "the exponential growth in eq.[eq : exp_prediction ] relies on two underlying assumptions @xcite :    the velocity field admits a linear approximation in space throughout the observation time ; and    the observation time is much longer than the correlation time of the velocity gradients .",
    "these requirements are quite stringent and are not fulfilled by our experiment . to the best of our knowledge",
    "these assumptions have not been met experimentally for tracer particles so far , and yet the exponential growth prediction seems to be the leading paradigm in interpreting experimental results @xcite .",
    "our estimations for the experimental system presented here indicate these may be possibly relevant for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "examining the experimental parameters reported in recent works @xcite we find that the trade - off between short correlation times and a large enough dissipation scale renders them difficult to reach in intense inertial turbulence , as batchelor himself anticipated @xcite ; also see @xcite .",
    "the lesson in this case highlights the limitations of asymptotic analyses for the descriptions of real - world flows  for practical purposes the asymptotic dynamics are not necessarily the generic description which should be considered but rather the short - time behaviour , here dictated by the eulerian averages at the initial time .",
    "according to our findings the lyapunov exponents picture is not the appropriate one to describe the dynamics of wall - bounded elastic turbulence at scales larger than few percent of the vessel size .",
    "this raises questions regarding the mechanism for polymer stretching once their end - to - end distance reaches few microns length .",
    "following our work one may reach the conclusion that the batchelor prediction @xcite is irrelevant . by all means ,",
    "this is not the case !",
    "batchelor considered the evolution of the total length of a material line while this work , like the above mentioned reports @xcite , focused on the shortest distance between pairs of tracers starting with a finite initial separation .",
    "therefore the question of what natural or experimental systems admit the assumptions underlying the exponential pair dispersion eq.[eq : exp_prediction ] for tracer particles persists .",

    "elastic turbulence is essentially a low reynolds number and a high weissenberg number phenomenon .",
    "the former means the inertial non - linearity of the flow is over - damped by the viscous dissipation .",
    "the latter estimates how dominant is the non - linear coupling of the elastic stresses to the spatial gradients of the velocity field compared with the dissipation of these stresses via relaxation .",
    "this is the leading consideration in the design of the flow cell .",
    "the lagrangian trajectories are inferred from passive tracers seeded in the fluid . in order to study the dynamics of pairs ,",
    "the 3d positions of the tracers are needed to be resolved , even when tracers get nearby to each other .",
    "the requirement of large sample statistics dictates the long duration of the experiment , which lasts over days .",
    "the fluctuations due to the chaotic nature of the flow set the temporal resolution at milliseconds .",
    "this leads to a data generation rate of about .",
    "hence both the acquisition and the analysis processes are required to be steady and fully automated . the 3d positions of the fluorescent particles are determined using 2d single camera imaging , by measuring the diffraction rings generated by the out - of - focus particle . this way the particle localisation problem turns into a ring detection problem @xcite .",
