    "black holes ( bhs ) are objects predicted by the laws of physics : they naturally arise by solving the field equations of general relativity . in terms of mass , a bh can be classified as supermassive ( @xmath0@xmath1  m@xmath2 ) , intermediate ( @xmath12@xmath13  m@xmath2 ) , stellar ( @xmath3@xmath4  m@xmath2 ) or sub - stellar ( @xmath14  m@xmath2 ) . it is now well - established that supermassive bhs ( smbhs ) reside in the centres of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) including our own galaxy with a @xmath15  m@xmath2 smbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "intermediate mass bhs might form either in the core of star clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these bhs can be detected indirectly by studying the gas and star dynamics on their surroundigs .",
    "in fact , a few have now been found ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a stellar mass bh is the likely remnant of an exploded star with an initial mass greater than @xmath16@xmath17  m@xmath2 .",
    "it is best detected if it is part of a binary system with a giant star as companion from studying its dynamics .",
    "another path to detection arises when the giant star gas , if fueling a bh , forms an accretion disk , the inner parts of which shine brightly in x - rays and @xmath10-rays . with an estimated mass of @xmath18@xmath19  m@xmath2 ,",
    "the x - ray source cyg x1 is the strongest candidate for a stellar mass bh in a binary system @xcite .",
    "it seems that the only way to form bhs with masses smaller than about 3  m@xmath2 in the present universe is in accelerators such as the _ large hadron collider _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or , eventually , when cosmic - rays collide with the upper layers of the atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , in both cases , the detection of bhs ( with a few planck masses ",
    "@xmath20 ) might only take place within the framework of extra dimensions .",
    "rather more promising is the possibility of these smaller bhs ( @xmath21  m@xmath2 ) having been formed during the early stages of the universe ( in which case they are called primordial black holes ( pbhs ) ) due , for example , to the gravitational collapse of density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that , when quantum effects are taken into account , bhs radiate .",
    "this process hardly affects stellar mass bhs , but it could be very significant in the case of smaller mass pbhs .",

    "we explore the pathway for direct bh detection which , if someday successful , could revolutionize the way we identify bhs in the universe .",

    "a bh is completely characterized by only three parameters : mass @xmath26 , electric charge @xmath27 and angular momentum per unit mass @xmath28 .",

    "there is a remarkable analogy between the laws of bh mechanics and the laws of thermodynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , for an extreme reissner  nordstrm bh ( @xmath43 ) or a maximum kerr bh ( @xmath44 ) the temperature is zero .",
    "thus , for a given mass @xmath26 , schwarzschild bhs are the hottest ones and , consequently , the ones that offer more hypotheses of detection .",

    "bhs are objects predicted by the laws of physics . in terms of mass they could have from a few planck masses ( @xmath20 ) up to @xmath275  m@xmath2 .",
    "smbhs have already been identified in the centre of many galaxies , including our own . in terms of stellar mass ,",
    "strong candidates have been identified in binary systems .",
    "all , however were detected via indirect means ( e.g. dynamical interactions with their surroundings ) .",
    "sub - stellar mass bhs might have been produced during the early stages of the universe .",
    "in particular , those with an initial mass of @xmath276 or greater should still be lurking around us at the present time ( smaller ones should have already completely evaporated ) .",
    "there are hopes of directly detecting these pbhs via the electromagnetic radiation that they emit .",
    "it was this path that we explored in this paper . in summary ,",
    "such a bh must : a ) have a mass on @xmath238 $ ]  m@xmath2 , i.e. , it must be primordial and not have already exploded ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; b ) radiate according to equation ( [ particle_emission ] ) ; c ) be a schwarzschild bh ( not being one will reduce its chances of detection ) .",
    "we have assumed present detector technologies , as regards sensitivity ( conservative , since these will become better in the future ) .",
    "it was our aim to show that , using detectors based on these technologies , it might be possible to look for signatures of individual bhs ( not necessarily at the end stage of their evaporation process when they explode giving rise to a @xmath10-ray burst ) .",
    "we point out three paradigmatic examples :    * a bh like the fourth in table  [ tbl - max ] ( @xmath277 ; 10@xmath278  m@xmath2 ) is detectable in the optical _ and _ uv up to @xmath279 : in detail , these detection possibilities are seen in curves ( 2,3,4 ) of figure  [ figure1 ] ( @xmath280 ) .",
    "the evaporation time of such a bh is @xmath281  yr ( cf .",
    "equation [ equ - evaptime ] ) which means that it would emit a steady and continuous flux for a long time at all wavelengths .",
    "good sampling of the emission at ir , optical and uv wavelengths could be enough to unequivocally identify the source of emission as a pbh , since the shape of the emission curve as given by equation ( [ particle_emission ] ) is quite unique . *",
    "a bh with @xmath282 ( 10@xmath283  m@xmath2 ; @xmath284 ; @xmath285 ) can be detected in @xmath10-rays at a maximum distance of @xmath286 ( @xmath287  au ) or @xmath288 ( @xmath289  au ) depending on the detector used ( figure  [ figure2 ] , the points at the extreme left of the curves ( 4,5 ) ) .",
    "such a detection will open the path to study the emission curve within the @xmath10-ray domain . * a bh with @xmath235 ( 10@xmath290  m@xmath2 ; @xmath291 )",
    "can be detected in @xmath10-rays at a maximum distance of 0.03  pc or 0.1  pc depending on the detector used ( figure  [ figure2 ] , curves ( 5,6 ) ) .",
    "such a bh would explode in a few decades ( or less ) which means that monitoring its flux levels could identify it as a pbh and even allow a prediction of the time of its explosion .",
    "laboratorial detection of electromagnetic radiation emitted by planckian - size bhs might also be possible .",
    "in fact , if we live in a universe with more than three spatial dimensions then it is expected that these planckian - size bhs might be produced at the lhc .",
    "the detection of a bh at the lhc would provide a first experimental and secure test of the electromagnetic radiation emission mechanism .",
    "focusing now on practicalities , the farther we look into the universe ( the larger the volume sampled ) the better our chances of finding a small - mass bh .",
    "it seems , then , that the best waveband to start searching for bhs is @xmath10-rays @xmath292  pc ) .",
    "however we do recomend that the detection should be attempted on the other electromagnetic spectrum bands as well . on the x - ray band , for example ,",
    "we migth be able to detect bhs at distances of the order of the earth - moon distance .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that , within some scenarios , it is expected a number of @xmath293 pbhs within the oort cloud . for these pbhs , mainly with @xmath294  g , the electromagnetic emission peaks at the hard x - ray band .",
    "it is plausible that , throughout the history of the solar system , some pbhs might have been thrown into the inner solar system following the same fate as the comets ( i.e. , we could have pbhs describing elliptical orbits with semi - major axis @xmath4@xmath295  au ) .",
    "that would improve the chances of direct detection of a pbh by a space probe .",
    "for example , nasa is planing to launch , possibly in 2014 , the _ innovative interstellar explorer _ ( iie ) a mission that is expected to reach 200  au in about 30 years after launch @xcite .    we will need to study the cosmological density of small - mass bhs in order to find the probability of detecting these directly , given the results of this paper ( sobrinho & augusto , in prep . ) .",
    "then , we will have a more complete idea on the potential of current and future space missions as regards direct detection of bhs .",
