    "ultracold laboratories have had great success in creating bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite in a variety of atomic gases such as rubidium ( rb ) , lithium ( li ) , sodium ( na ) and ytterbium ( yb ) .",
    "these quantum fluids exist in various isotopic forms as well as in different hyperfine states .",
    "the rapid pace of development in this field has led to condensates which are robust and relatively easy to manipulate experimentally .",
    "in particular , the tunability of inter - species and intra - species interactions  @xcite via magnetic and optical feshbach resonances makes the bec mixture a very attractive candidate for exploring new phenomena involving quantum coherence and nonlinearity in a multicomponent system .",
    "the subject of this paper is to investigate the tunneling dynamics of a binary mixture of becs in a double well potential . a single species of bec in a double well",
    "is called a bosonic josephson junction ( bjj ) , since it is a bosonic analog of the well known superconducting josephson junction .",
    "in addition to josephson oscillations ( jo ) , the bjj exhibits various novel phenomena such as @xmath0-modes and macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) , as predicted theoretically  @xcite . in the jo and the @xmath0-modes , the condensate oscillates symmetrically about the two wells of the potential .",
    "in contrast to this , the mqst dynamics represents a broken symmetry phase as the tunneling solutions exhibit population imbalance between the two wells of the potential .",
    "these various features have been observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "our motivation is to explore whether new phenomena arise when there are two interacting condensates trapped in a symmetric double well .",
    "although our formulation and results are valid for a variety of bec mixtures , our main focus here is the rb family of two isotopes , namely the mixture of @xmath1rb and @xmath2rb , motivated by the experimental setup at jila@xcite .",
    "the scattering length of @xmath1rb is known to be @xmath3 atomic units while the interspecies scattering length is @xmath4 atomic units . in experiments ,",
    "the scattering length of @xmath2rb can be tuned using the feshbach resonance method  @xcite .",
    "the ability to tune the scattering length of one of the species makes this mixture of isotopes an ideal candidate for studying the coupled bjj system .",
    "first , it opens up the possibility of exploring the parameter space where the rb 8585 scattering length is equal to the rb 8787 scattering length .",
    "as will be discussed below , this symmetric parameter regime simplifies the theoretical analysis of the system and also captures most of the new phenomena that underlie the dynamics of the binary mixture .",
    "furthermore , the tunability of the @xmath2rb scattering length can be exploited to study a unique possibility where one of the species has a negative scattering length , a case which strongly favors the @xmath0-mode oscillations that have not been observed so far .    in our exploration of nonlinear tunneling dynamics of coupled bjj systems ,",
    "the mqst states are found to be of two types . in the broken  symmetry mqst state",
    ", the two components may localize in different wells resulting in a phase separation or they may localize in the same well and hence coexist . by varying the parameters such as initial conditions , the phase  separated broken ",
    "symmetry mqst states can be transformed to a symmetry  restoring phase where the species continually  avoid \" each other by swapping places between the two wells .",
    "in other words , if the dynamics is initiated with both species in the same potential well , the sustained tunneling oscillations are seen where the two species swap places between the well one and the well two . from the coexisting mqst phase",
    ", one can achieve symmetry restoring swapping dynamics by initiating the dynamics with two species in the separate wells . in this case",
    ", the emergence of the swapping modes can be interpreted as a phase where the two species  chase \" each other .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ two_mode ] , we discuss the model and use the two  mode approximation to the gross  pitaevskii ( gp ) equation to map it to a system of two coupled pendulums with momentum ",
    "dependent lengths and coupling .",
    "section [ fixed_pts ] discusses the stationary solutions and their stability .",
    "these results enable us to look for various qualitatively different effects without actually solving the gp equations .",
    "section [ dynamics ] describes the numerical solutions of the gp equations as various parameters of the system are tuned .",
    "although we have explored the multi - dimensional parameter space , the novelties attributed to the binary mixture in a double well trap are presented in a restricted parameter space where the scattering lengths of the two species are equal .",
    "additionally , in our numerical results described here , we fix the ratio of rb 8787 interaction to rb 85 - 87 interaction to be @xmath5 .",
    "this restricted parameter space is accessible in the jila setup and provides a simple means to describe various highlights of the mixture dynamics .",
    "section [ experiment ] provides additional details of the jila setup relevant for our investigation .",
    "a summary is given in section [ summary ] .",

    "such modes exhibit quasiperiodic dynamics characterized by superposition of sinusoidal modes with two competing frequencies . as @xmath127 increases , we see large amplitude non - sinusoidal oscillations .",

    "the system enters the symmetry breaking mqst phase , as predicted by the fixed point analysis earlier .",

    "transition to mqst is accompanied by phase separation : although the two species overlap for some time , the @xmath130 and the @xmath131 have opposite signs .",
    "as @xmath110 increases further , the system exhibits `` swapping - modes '' where the two species swap places between the two wells but remain phase separated as shown in fig .  4 .",
    "as seen in the figure ( at @xmath132 ) , the dynamics is initiated with positive population imbalance of both species",
    ". however , the resulting dynamics corresponds to back and forth motion where the two species swap places between the two wells .",
    "in contrast to mqst , the swapping dynamics restores the symmetry of the tunneling solution in the double well .",
    "however , the two species remain mostly phase separated , _ avoiding each other by swapping_.    in other words , the swapping phase is characterized by @xmath133 , but @xmath134 .",
    "that is , at a given instant of time , the two species are more likely to be found in the separate wells .",
    "thus in the swapping mode , the two species oscillate back and forth between the two wells and still manage to avoid each other .",
    "the swapping is found to occur in the nonlinear zero - mode as well as in the running mode .",
    "furthermore , a transition from mqst to swapping phase can be achieved either by varying @xmath110 ( fig .",
    "5 ) or by varying the initial conditions ( fig .  6 ) .",
    "+    for @xmath135 , and @xmath128 , and @xmath136,both species execute small amplitude oscillations with @xmath137 and @xmath138 , as shown in fig .",
    "7 such modes are characterized by superposition of sinusoidal modes with two competing frequencies and the resulting dynamics is in general quasiperiodic . as expected from the fixed point analysis , the two species with both inter and intra - species repulsive interaction can self - trap in the same well .",
    "that is , we have mqst where the species coexist in the same potential well , inspite of repulsive interaction among them .       +    as illustrated in figure [ fig8 ] , within the @xmath0-mode phase , if the dynamics of the two species is initiated in separate wells , that is , @xmath139 and @xmath140 have opposite signs , the mqst phase can be destroyed when the initial population imbalance increases beyond a critical value .",
    "the tunneling solutions become symmetric as mqst is replaced by swapping modes . in this case",
    "the swapping can be viewed as the two species `` chasing '' each other .",
    "it should be noted that the swapping dynamics in the zero and the @xmath0-modes is very similar .",
    "however , swapping in the zero - mode corresponds to two species avoiding each other while swapping in the @xmath0-mode corresponds to one component chasing the other .",
    "this is because , in the zero - mode , species prefer residing in the separate wells while in the @xmath0-mode , they like to stay in the same well .",
    "this unique type of coherence between the two different species is one of the most fascinating aspect of the binary mixture dynamics in double well potential .",
    "the effects described in this paper should be realizable for condensate mixtures that already exist in the laboratory .",
    "one example in particular is a mixture of @xmath2rb and @xmath1rb atoms that has been created in several recent experiments at jila  @xcite .",
    "this system is relevant to the analysis in this paper because the scattering length , @xmath141 , that characterizes the interaction between @xmath2rb atoms is tunable by an external magnetic field via a feshbach resonance centered at approximately 155 gauss  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the interspecies scattering length , @xmath142 , is also tunable with two feshbach resonances ( for a @xmath143/@xmath144 collision ) located at approximately @xmath145 gauss and @xmath146 gauss .    in the most recent experiment  @xcite ,",
    "a @xmath2rb/@xmath1rb bec mixture was produced by trapping a thermal  gas sample of the mixture and performing evaporative cooling on the @xmath1rb which sympathetically cools the @xmath2rb .",
    "the cold gas mixture is then transferred to an optical trap that provides tight confinement transverse to the trapping beam and loose confinement along the beam .",
    "if an additional pair of beams were applied along this direction as was done in the albiez experiment  @xcite , it would create a setup to which the analysis in this paper would apply .",
    "existence of a variety of bec species with tunable inter and intra  species scattering lengths makes bec mixtures one of the most attractive candidates for exploring novel phenomena involving quantum coherence and nonlinearity .",
    "our analysis , based on the two - mode gp equation for the two interacting species of bec in a double well trap unveils a variety of phenomena describing broken symmetry as well as subsequent restoration of symmetry , as we change the parameters or the initial conditions .",
    "such coherence is found to exist over a broad range of parameters , establishing the robustness of the effects .    to make direct comparison with experiments , we need to solve the coupled gp equations to obtain various parameters of the effective coupled pendulum system in terms of the microscopic parameters of the system and work in this direction",
    "is in progress .",
    "furthermore , by quantizing the hamiltonian ( coupled pendulum or the spin hamiltonian ) , we hope to study quantum dynamics of number fluctuations that may code the emergence of new quantum phases in the system .    99    m. h. anderson _",

    "<S> in contrast to the symmetry breaking macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) solutions , the swapping modes correspond to the tunneling dynamics that preserves the symmetry of the double well potential . as a consequence of two distinct types of broken symmetry mqst phases where the two species localize in the different potential welils or coexist in the same well , the corresponding symmetry restoring swapping modes result in dynamics where the the two species either avoid or chase each other . in view of the possibility to control the interaction between the species , the binary mixture offers a very robust system to observe these novel effects as well as the phenomena of josephson oscillations and pi - modes </S>"
