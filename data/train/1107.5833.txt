    "the physics of ultracold quantum gases has been the object of an intense experimental and theoretical investigation since the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in dilute trapped gases in 1995 @xcite .",
    "a common ingredient of these experiments is the so called time - of - flight , that is the expansion of the gas after the release of the confining potential .",
    "for some typical experimental regimes , the expansion after the release from harmonic traps can be described by scaling solutions , in terms of three scaling parameters @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , which obey a system of second - order ordinary differential equations , of the general form ( where @xmath3 are the trapping frequencies ) @xcite @xmath4 with initial conditions @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , @xmath7 corresponds to the case of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) limit @xcite , whereas @xmath8 refers to a unitary superfluid fermi gas @xcite .",
    "the solution of the above equations allows the complete characterization of the expansion of the cloud size as @xmath9 .    in the case of strongly elongated cylindrically - symmetric traps , @xmath10 ,",
    "the above equations read    [ eq : bz ] = + = .",
    "[ eq : bperp ]    with @xmath11 .",
    "usually , these equations are solved by means of an expansion in powers of @xmath12 , by the ansatz @xmath13 for example , for the bec case @xmath7 , one retains the zeroth - order in @xmath14 , and up to second order in @xmath15 , leading to the well - known castin and dum scaling @xcite    b _ ( ) = + b_z ( ) = 1 + ^2(- ) [ eq : bperp_cd ]    that nicely describes the experimental data @xcite .    from these expression",
    "one can also infer the asymptotic aspect ratio , defined as @xmath16 @xcite . however",
    ", one may notice that the above expansion is strictly valid only in the perturbative regime , when the second order correction in ( [ eq : bperp_cd ] ) is smaller that unity , namely for @xmath17 .",
    "this condition is in general well satisfied in the typical experimental regimes , but in principle does not permit the direct extraction of the asymptotic limit , because of the secular term @xmath18 that eventually invalidates the perturbative expansion .    here",
    "we present a general method , based on a _ multiple - scale _ perturbative expansion , that allows the derivation of a _ uniformly valid _ expansion , where the hierarchy of sub - leading terms is preserved at _ any time_. this can be achieved by means of a proper resummation of the secular terms @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : formulation ] we reformulate the problem by using a hamiltonian approach ( see also @xcite ) . in ",
    "[ sect : naivea ] we show that the leading term of the asymptotic ratio can be computed already at zeroth - order in the naive expansion , by using the expression in terms of the canonical momenta ( avoiding secularities ) .",
    "we find that this result may represent a good approximation of the exact ( numerical ) asymptotic aspect ratio , depending on the value of @xmath19 , and provided that @xmath0 is small enough .",
    "however , it may deviate significantly from the exact solution for @xmath20 , already for not too large values of @xmath0 ( e.g. @xmath21 ) . in  [ sect : naiveb ] we show that the next - to - leading order in the naive expansion gives rise to secular terms for any @xmath19 , requiring therefore a different expansion approach . then , in sect . [",
    "sect : multiscale ] we introduce the general ideas for the multiple scale approach , and consider the next - to - leading correction to the asymptotic aspect ratio , addressing in particular the case @xmath7 and @xmath22 . in both cases",
    "the expansion tuns out to be _ non - analytic _ due to the presence of terms proportional to @xmath23 ( @xmath7 ) or @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we then recapitulate and offer prospective applications of the method .",
    "equations ( [ eq : bz])-([eq : bperp ] ) are equivalent to the canonical equations ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) @xmath28 generated by the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath29 where the initial conditions @xmath5 , @xmath6 set the total energy to @xmath30 .",

    "we will see in the following how to improve this result .",

    "this behavior is physically correct because we expect non - zero asymptotic limits for both velocities .",
    "however , with regard to perturbation theory , the growing of the first order correction must be interpreted as the occurrence of a secular term relative to the naive zeroth - order solution @xmath60 .",
    "that is , the perturbative hypothesis breaks down after times of order @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , to avoid the appearance of these terms we propose a reinterpretation of the perturbative analysis in the framework of multiple - scale analysis .",
    "it is notable that the resummation involved in this procedure implies that the higher - order terms of the velocities are @xmath62 if @xmath63 , and @xmath64 when @xmath65 .",
    "we begin by introducing an additional time scale @xmath66 , and assume a perturbative expansion @xmath67 in such a form that the corrections @xmath68 and @xmath69 must be not secular with respect to @xmath70 and @xmath71 in @xmath59 time ; i.e. @xmath68 and @xmath69 must be consistently be of order @xmath36 with respect to @xmath70 and @xmath71 for all values of @xmath59 .",
    "the derivative symbol `` @xmath72 '' is now replaced by @xmath73 . at leading order ,",
    "it is nearly obvious that the choosing of @xmath74 as @xmath75 removes the linear secularity .",

    "this leads to an asymptotic growth rate that is slower than linear .",

    "notice that earlier we were able to predict the asymptotic ratio to first order from the zeroth order result by using the hamiltonian approach ; analogously here we can obtain an improved aspect ratio .",
    "let us now consider the axial momentum , whose asymptotic value can be obtained as @xmath90 in order to extract the next - to - leading corrections , it is sufficient to consider its equation of motion up to order @xmath12 @xmath91 then , the integration of the first term gives @xmath92+\\dots\\nonumber , \\quad",
