    "according to the factorization theorem , the cross sections for dis reactions and some classes of hadron - hadron collisions can be expressed as convolution of two parts : a short - distance perturbative and a long - distance nonperturbative ones .",
    "the perturbative part , describing partonic cross sections at sufficiently high scale of the momentum transfer @xmath0 can be calculated within perturbative chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "the non - perturbative part contains universal , process independent parton distribution functions @xmath1 ( pdf ) and fragmentation functions @xmath2 ( ff ) , which can be measured experimentally .",
    "the evolution of these functions with the interaction scale @xmath3 is again described with the use of the perturbative qcd methods .",
    "the standard dglap approach @xcite enables one to calculate parton densities which characterize the internal nucleon structure at a given scale @xmath3 when these densities are known for a certain input scale @xmath4 .",
    "we have shown that also the truncated mellin moments of the pdfs , @xmath5 , satisfy the dglap evolution equations and can be an additional tool in the qcd analysis of structure functions . the major advantage of the tmma is a possibility to adapt theoretical qcd analysis to the experimentally available region of the bjorken-@xmath6 variable . in this way , one can avoid the problem of dealing with the unphysical region @xmath7 corresponding to the infinite energy of interaction .",
    "a number of important issues in particle physics , e.g. , solving of the ` nucleon spin puzzle ' , quark - hadron duality or higher twist contributions to the structure functions refers directly to moments . note that tmm , contrary to standard moments , may be directly extracted from the accurate ( jlab ) data by appropriate binning ( keeping @xmath3 fixed ) .",
    "these issues initiate a large number of experimental projects and theoretical studies as well .",
    "below we present the generalization of dglap evolution equations within tmma and discuss some applications in spin physics .",
    "the main finding of the tmma is that the generalized truncated ( cut ) moments ( cmm ) obtained by multiple integrations as well as multiple differentiations of the original parton distribution also satisfy the dglap equations with the simply transformed evolution kernel @xcite .",
    "a similar generalized evolution equation , with the correspondingly modified coefficient functions , can also be obtained for structure functions . in table",
    "[ table 1 ] , we summarize the generalized cmm together with the correspondingly transformed dglap evolution kernels .",

    "below we present examples of applications of tmma to analysis of the bjorken sum rule @xcite and fragmentation functions .      for any normalized function @xmath19 , @xmath20 , one can construct generalized cmm @xmath21 as a mellin convolution with the function @xmath22 , which obeys the dglap evolution equation with the rescaled kernel @xcite : @xmath23 @xmath24 the special case of @xmath25 is suitable for the generalized bjorken sum rule ( bsr ) : @xmath26 @xmath27 has the same evolution kernel as @xmath28 and the generalized bsr is equal to the ordinary bsr : @xmath29 the corresponding cut first moments of @xmath27 go to the bsr limit as the cut point @xmath30 goes to zero .",
    "this allows one to study behaviour of the generalized cut moments near @xmath31 and estimate the value of the bsr from the cut integrals @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",

    "one can see that simple input parametrization 7 , where @xmath35 can satisfactorily reproduce the experimental data .",

    "we use different parametrization of the ff at the initial scale @xcite .",
    "the excess of the obtained moments for pions , providing the main contributions to sum rule , over the charge conservation values at @xmath61 may be considered as a support of inapplicability of independent fragmentation picture at this region .",
    "this fact is also exhibited in the large differences in the presented predictions in this region , depending on the input parametrization , for both pions and kaons . therefore tmm approach can be a natural tool also in the study of the fragmentation functions , requiring further investigations .",
