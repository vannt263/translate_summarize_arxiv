    "stellar surface brightness is directly related to stellar broad - band color , and it is also a function of stellar apparent magnitude and angular size ( @xcite ) . these dependencies can be combined to show that the stellar angular size can be predicted from stellar photometry , even in the presence of interstellar extinction :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the limb - darkening corrected angular stellar diameter in milliarcseconds , @xmath4 is the apparent stellar magnitude in the @xmath5-band , and @xmath6 is the broad - band stellar color @xmath7 . the family of functions expressed by eq",
