    "measuring this effect requires extreme redshift precision over time baselines of decades , and the signal may thus be overwhelmed by other systematic effects , both physical and observational .",
    "for example , secular redshift drift may be induced by proper acceleration of the observer . such proper acceleration ( but not the associated redshift drift )",
    "has been very precisely measured using pulsar timing in a galactic reference frame @xcite and in a cosmological context using the proper motion of extragalactic radio sources @xcite .",
    "proper acceleration of the solar system barycenter about the galactic center creates an extragalactic dipole proper motion secular aberration drift signature on the sky that distinguishes it from a cosmological signal : objects appear to be moving toward the galactic center .",
    "astrometry and pulsar timing can not , however , detect a change in the expansion rate of the universe , which is purely radial .",
    "the observed rate of change of redshift , @xmath17 ( hereafter @xmath18 ) , is the difference between a constant expansion rate at redshift @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and its actual value @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 for a matter- and cosmological constant - dominated universe , and @xmath24 is the observer s time increment @xcite . for a time - varying dark energy parameterized with scale factor - dependent equation of state @xmath25 @xcite where @xmath26 is the scale factor , the hubble expansion becomes @xmath27 the observed acceleration is @xmath28 the secular redshift drift and corresponding acceleration are plotted for several cosmologies in fig .",

    "a direct measurement of @xmath0  is completely model - independent and directly indicates the history of expansion , whatever that may be .",
    "here we examine the feasibility of measuring or constraining secular redshift drift using 21  cm absorption line systems .",
    "we demonstrate that with modern telescopes , observations spanning roughly a decade can measure redshifts to parts per 100 million and constrain the redshift drift to down a few m  s@xmath4  yr@xmath4 .",
    "analog spectra show a systematic redshift offset from modern digital spectra , which limits the time baselines available for @xmath0  measurements and impacts previous constraints on the cosmic evolution of physical constants that employed analog 21 cm spectra .",
    "we revise the measurement of the evolution of @xmath29 over the redshift span @xmath132.04 .    in the following treatment of @xmath0",
    ", we make no assumptions about cosmology ; the only numbers needed are the speed of light , @xmath30  km  s@xmath4 , and the rest frequency of the 21  cm spin - flip transition , @xmath31  mhz , although neither is truly needed to measure a redshift change since it is ultimately simply a shift in the observed frequency .",
    "analog data provide long time baselines , in some cases more than 30 years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we find a systematic offset toward lower redshifts compared to single - telescope digital epochs ( figure [ fig : example ] ) .",
    "these systematic offsets appear in most pre - digital spectra but are not consistent between absorption line systems , suggesting that they are instrumental and uncorrectable .",
    "we thus excluded the high quality and potentially useful observations from analog epochs .",
    "moreover , most extant digital spectra lack the signal - to - noise needed for this study , and in order to minimize systematics we restrict all spectral epochs to those obtained using the green bank telescope ( gbt ) , except as noted below .",
    "we observed 13 21 cm absorption line systems in 20032004 using the gbt spectrometer and repeated the observations in 2012 ( programs gbt 03c-009 and 12a-134 , respectively ) .",
