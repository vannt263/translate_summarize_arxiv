    "dark matter is , most often , not considered in the mass varying neutrino ( mavan ) models .",
    "the treatment of dark energy and dark matter in the gcg unified scheme naturally offers this possibility . identifying sterile neutrinos as dark matter coupled with dark energy provides the conditions to implement such unified picture in the mavan formulation since active and sterile neutrino states are connected through the _ seesaw _ mechanism for mass generation .",

    "the dynamics of the coupled fluid composed by neutrinos , dark matter and dark energy is driven by one single degree of freedom , the scalar field , @xmath2 .",
    "the simplest realization of mavan mechanisms @xcite consists in writing down an effective potential which , in addition to a scalar field dependent term , contains a term related to the neutrino energy density .",
    "it results in the so - called adiabatic condition , which sometimes leads to the stationary regime for the scalar field in respect with an effective potential @xcite .",
    "one indeed expect a tiny contribution from cosmological neutrinos to the energy density of the universe .",
    "mavan scenarios essentially predict massless neutrinos until recent times .",
    "when their mass eventually grows close to its present value , they form a non - relativistic ( nr ) fluid and the interaction with the scalar field stops its evolution .",
    "the relic particle mass is generated from the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field and becomes linked to its dynamics : @xmath3 .",
    "it is presumed that the neutrino mass has its origin on the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the scalar field and its behavior is governed by the dependence of the scalar field on the scale factor .",
    "in fact , it is well - known that the active neutrino masses are tiny as compared to the masses of the charged fermions .",
    "this can be understood through the symmetry of the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions .",
    "it involves only left - handed neutrinos such that no renormalizable mass term for the neutrinos is compatible with the sm gauge symmetry @xmath4 .",
    "once one has assumed that baryon number and lepton number is conserved for renormalizable interactions , neutrino masses can only arise from an effective dimension five operator .",
    "it involves two powers of the vacuum expectation value of the higgs doublet .",
    "they are suppressed by the inverse power of a large mass scale @xmath5 of a sterile right - handed majorana neutrino , since it has hypercharge null in the sm .",

    "one sees that model dependent choices of dynamical masses of dark matter allows for reproducing the conditions for the present cosmic acceleration in an effective gcg scenario .",
    "the stability conditions resulted from a positive squared speed of sound , @xmath6 , is recovered . in section iii , we discuss the neutrino mass generation mechanism in the context of the gcg model . following the simplest formulation of the _ seesaw _ mechanism , dirac neutrino masses with analytical dependencies on @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are considered . in section iv",

    "let us then turn back to the explanation for the smallness of the neutrino masses . according to the _ seesaw _ mechanism , the tiny masses , @xmath77 , of the usual left - handed neutrinos are obtained through a very massive , @xmath5 , sterile right - handed neutrino . the lagrangian density that describes the simplest version of the _ seesaw _ mechanism via yukawa coupling between a light scalar field and a single neutrino flavor",

    "it is also clear that promoting the scalar field @xmath0 into a dynamical quantity leads to a mechanism in the context of which neutrino masses are time - dependent . associating the scalar field to the dark energy field allows linking nr neutrino energy densities to late cosmological times @xcite .",
    "this scenario can be implemented through the perturbative approach via eq .",
    "( [ gcg06 ] ) @xcite .",
    "it is evident that this approach is fairly general , as well as independent of the choice of the equation of state and of the dependence of the neutrino mass on the scalar field .",
    "the form of @xmath64 and of the equation of state can indeed lead to quite different scenarios .",
    "in particular , we consider three cases of neutrino mass dependence on @xmath0 . in case 01",
    "we set @xmath82 , in case 02 we have set @xmath83 , and in case 03 we have set @xmath84 .",

    "[ gcg-0 ] .",
    "the neutrino densities are computed for neutrinos masses correlated to the dark matter mass , @xmath64 , in correspondence with the gcg scenario with @xmath87 , that represents a realistic fraction of dark energy , and with @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in the fig .",
    "[ gcg - b ] we have taken into account the energy densities for photons ( @xmath90 ) and baryons ( @xmath91 ) in complement to our effective gcg scenario .",
    "then we have computed the relative modifications on the spectrum of the cosmic evolution of the dark sector components .    conveniently in agreement with the phenomenological predictions ,",
    "we have set the present values of the energy densities as : @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "assuming that neutrinos are nr at present , and observing the behavior of eqs .",

    "this condition allows one to establish the correspondence between the values of @xmath16 for which the coupling transition takes place , i. e. the transition between relativistic and nr regimes , so that the neutrino masses achieve the present - day values . for our model",
    "such a transition is governed by the dfg behavior of eq .",
    "( [ gcg01d ] ) .",
    "these scenarios are by no means the only possibilities .",
    "in particular , we choose them as they correspond to the simplest feasible possibility for active neutrino mass generation , given that the scalar field has mass dimension one @xcite .",
    "the essential information of the mass dependence on the scale factor is that , for case 03 , the neutrino mass increases with decreasing @xmath0 , in opposition to what happens for cases 01 and 02 . through the stability analysis performed in the next section",
    "we shall elucidate some important consequences due to such a distinct behavior .    in the fig .",
    "[ gcg - c ] we verify how the energy density @xmath18 and the corresponding equations of state @xmath71 for the composed fluid deviate from the effective gcg scenario . for mass varying cdm coupled with dark energy with @xmath66 , the effective gcc leads to similar predictions for @xmath98 , independently of the scale factor @xmath16 .",
    "the same is not true for hdm which , in the dfg approach , while weakly coupling with dark energy , leads to the same behavior of the gcg just at late times ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the possibility of adiabatic instabilities in cosmological scenarios was previously pointed out @xcite in a context of a mass varying neutrino model of dark energy . in opposition , in the usual treatment where dark matter are just coupled to dark energy , cosmic expansion together with the gravitational drag due to cold dark matter have a major impact on the stability of the cosmological background fluid .",
    "usually , for a general fluid for which we know the equation of state , the dominant effect on the sound speed squared @xmath6 arises from the dark sector component and not from the neutrino component .    for the models where the adiabatic regime ( cf .",
    "( [ pap09 ] ) ) implies an equation of state reproducing cosmological constant , @xmath65 , effects , @xmath100 , one obtains @xmath101 from the very start of the analysis .",
    "the effective gcg is free from this inconsistency .",
    "a detailed quantitative analysis of the stability conditions for the gcg in terms of the squared speed of sound is discussed in ref .",
    "positive @xmath6 implies that @xmath102 in the gcg equation of state .",
    "the coupling of the dark energy component with dynamical dark matter is responsible for removing such inconsistency by setting @xmath103 .    in the fig .",

    "we have considered the gcg phenomenological given by @xmath87 and @xmath106 ( solid line ) , @xmath107 ( dot line ) , @xmath108 ( dash dot line ) , and @xmath89 ( dash line ) .",
    "the perturbative influence of neutrinos on the positiveness of @xmath104 has its magnitude measured by comparing the results with those for the gcg scenario with and and without neutrino perturbation for each one of the three cases in correspondence with fig .",
    "[ gcg-0 ] . in this scenario ,",
    "the most important result illustrated by fig .",
    "[ gcg - d ] is that growing neutrino masses parameterized by @xmath109 ( case 03 ) results in instabilities at present times .",
    "this instability is characterized by a negative squared speed of sound for an effective coupled neutrino / dark energy fluid , and results in the exponential growth of small scale modes @xcite . a natural interpretation for this",
    "is that the universe becomes inhomogeneous with the neutrinos forming denser structures or lumps @xcite .",
    "effectively , the scalar field could mediate an attractive force between neutrinos leading to the formation of neutrino nuggets .",
    "anyway , these results are consistent with the accelerated expansion of the universe ruled by the dynamical masses of cdm and neutrinos since positive values for @xmath110 are observed , as we can notice in the fig .",
    "[ gcg - e ] .",
    "growing neutrinos coupled to mass varying dark matter plus cosmon-_like _ dark energy were studied assuming that the cosmological background unified fluid presents an effective behavior similar to that of the gcg .",
    "the essential ingredient of this class of models is a neutrino mass that , through the _ seesaw _ mechanism , depends on the cosmon field and grows in the course of the cosmological evolution .",
    "our setup is an effective gcg decomposed into two interacting components @xcite .",
    "the first one behaves like mass varying cdm since it is pressure - less .",
    "the second one corresponds to a cosmon-_like _ dark energy component @xmath0 with equation of state given by @xmath1 .",
    "apparently the model does not look different from the interacting quintessence models where one has two different interacting fluids .",
    "the present fraction of dark energy is set by a dynamical mechanism .",
    "as soon as dark matter become nr , their coupling to the cosmon triggers an effective stop ( or substantial slowing ) of the evolution of the cosmon . before this event",
    ", the quintessence field follows the tracking of the minimum of an effective potential , in a kind of stationary condition which drives the adiabatic regime , and for which the coupling strength is strong compared to gravitational strength .    in the scope of finding a natural explanation for the cosmic acceleration and the corresponding adequation to stability conditions ,",
    "we have proposed a systematic procedure to treat variations of fundamental parameters of neutrino cosmology ( @xmath0 , @xmath77 and @xmath5 ) independent of any particular theoretical model which enforces restrictive relations among these parameters .",
    "we have quantified the perturbative influence of such variations on the calculation of the squared speed of sound and on the cosmic acceleration of the universe , noticing that the former quantity is much more sensible to variations with respect to the exact gcg background cosmology .",
    "an interesting feature is however that the gcg has its cosmological evolution reproduced by a cdm mass varying mechanism consistent with the mass generation mechanism for neutrinos .",
    "most of dark sector models predict an entangled mixture of interacting dark matter and dark energy .",
    "we have consistently introduced the possibility of such a mixed coupling with active and sterile neutrinos , for which we have tested three hypothesis for _ seesaw _ masses .    at our approach , the mass scale @xmath5 and scalar field @xmath0",
    "are tightly coupled together and evolve as a unique effective fluid .",
    "the effective potential driving the evolution of the scalar field is decomposed into a sum of two terms , one arising from the original quintessence potential @xmath59 , and the other from the dynamical mass of the dark matter .",
    "the sterile neutrino mass produces the mass varying dark matter effects which indirectly result in mavan s , and the active neutrino has its mass perturbatively computed via _ seesaw _ relations . since the results for the cosmic acceleration followed by cosmological stability for gcg scenarios are well - defined , one can assert that the increase of neutrino mass acts as a cosmological clock or trigger for the crossover to the effective scenario here studied .",
    "in fact , a scalar field associated to dark energy in connection with the sm neutrinos and the electroweak interactions may bring important insights on the physics beyond the sm @xcite . the case of cosmological neutrinos , in particular , is a fascinating example where salient questions concerning sm particle phenomenology can be addressed and hopefully better understood .",
