    "far from its source , any electromagnetic wave can be locally approximated by a plane wave ; i.e. , with a well - defined direction of propagation and thus a specific transverse plane .",
    "such beamlike fields are described by two orthogonal electric - field components and , consequently , their polarization is characterized by a @xmath0 correlation matrix , usually called the polarization matrix  @xcite .",
    "this polarization matrix can be uniquely decomposed as a sum of two matrices : one represents a fully polarized part and the other a completely unpolarized part .",
    "the ratio of the intensity of the polarized part to the total intensity is the degree of polarization .",
    "equivalently , one may resort to the stokes parameters , which are the coefficients of the expansion of the polarization matrix onto the pauli basis .",
    "these variables determine a locus on the poincar sphere , wherein the state of polarization is elegantly visualized : actually , the degree of polarization can be seen as the length of the stokes vector .",
    "this two - dimensional ( 2d ) theory is the backbone of the standard polarization optics .",
    "however , the necessity of addressing new issues , such as highly nonparaxial fields  @xcite , narrow - band imaging systems  @xcite , and the recognition of associated propagation questions  @xcite , has revived interest in extending the 2d approach to fully three - dimensional ( 3d ) field distributions . although this question has been considered for many years , no satisfactory solution has thus far been found .",
    "indeed , there are several contradictory claims made in the literature on this subject  @xcite .",
    "the divergences occur because notions that are equivalent for the 2d case , lead to different definitions when extrapolated to the 3d limit .",
    "this diversity has prompted various authors to suggest alternative 3d measures of polarization based in , e.g. , non - quantum entanglement  @xcite , von neumann entropy  @xcite , the fully polarized field component  @xcite , or the invariants of the rotational group  @xcite .",
    "all of these instances produce sensible computable magnitudes , but they are hardly measurable , which prevents a proper assessment of their merits .    in this paper , we revisit an operational measure introduced some time ago in the realm of quantum optics  @xcite : in 2d , the prescription is to look at the minimum overlap between a state and the set of its polarization - transformed [ i.e. , su(2)-rotated ] counterparts .",
    "the key point is that this magnitude , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be directly determined as the visibility of an interference experiment .",
    "our main goal is to extend this notion to the 3d case .    to this end",
    ", we first reinterpret that measure as a distance between the state and its rotated partners . in this vein",
    ", it is worth stressing that distance measures have been successfully employed in assessing a number of disputed quantities , such as nonclassicality  @xcite , entanglement  @xcite , information  @xcite , non - gaussianity  @xcite , and localization  @xcite , to cite only a few examples .",
    "two main hurdles are usually faced when defining a distance - type measure : choosing a convenient metric and identifying a reference set of states . as to the first question ,",
    "different candidates have been investigated , including among others , relative entropy  @xcite , bures and related metrics  @xcite , as well as monge  @xcite , trace  @xcite , and hilbert - schmidt  @xcite distances , each having its own advantages for certain applications .",
    "in particular , the last one is probably the simplest from a computational viewpoint and will be adopted here .    in polarization , it has been suggested to take unpolarized states as the reference set , both in the quantum  @xcite and the classical domain  @xcite .",
    "such a set is very well characterized  @xcite and this provides sensible results . however , as anticipated above , we prefer to consider the rotated versions of the original state .",
    "going from the 2d to the 3d situation is just extending the su(2)-rotated set to its su(3 ) analog , and the resulting degrees have a clear physical interpretation .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dop ] we recall the basic tools used to describe the partial polarization of both 2d and 3d electromagnetic fields , emphasizing the similarities and differences between these two situations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : distbas ] , we introduce the general notion of degree of polarization as a distance , and work out the resulting expressions for both cases , comparing with previous proposed measures . finally , we summarize our work in sec .  [",
    "sec : conc ] .",
    "a pivotal quantity in the characterization of polarization of both 2d and 3d fields is the degree of polarization .",
    "it quantitatively captures the random character of the electric field as a function of time .",
    "such a behavior can not be accounted for in terms of a deterministic description : we must , instead , adopt a statistical perspective . to be as self - contained as possible",
    ", we briefly review the essential ingredients needed for that purpose .      consider a monochromatic beam propagating in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "the electric field can be resolved in the transverse plane in terms of horizontal ( @xmath2 ) and vertical ( @xmath3 ) components , which are taken to be a probabilistic ensemble given by @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath6 ( equal - time ) polarization matrix ( also called the coherence matrix ) is defined as  @xcite @xmath7 here , the brackets denote ensemble averaging over different realizations and the superscript indicates the dimensionality , although in the following we will suppress it when there is no risk of confusion .",
    "the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath8 represent the energy distribution between the two components of the field : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the trace of the matrix . without loss of generality",
    ", we henceforth normalize this intensity to unity .",
    "on the other hand , the off - diagonal elements describe the correlations between the field components . from its very definition",
    ", it follows that @xmath11 , so @xmath8 is hermitian .",
    "the matrix @xmath8 can be conveniently decomposed in terms of the ( hermitian ) pauli matrices @xmath12 ; the result reads @xmath13 the normalized coordinates @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) can be recovered as @xmath16 and are nothing but the stokes parameters . in other words , we can map each polarization matrix @xmath8 into a stokes vector @xmath17 .",
    "the length of @xmath18 will be denoted as @xmath19 and , as we shall justify soon , deserves the name of degree of polarization for 2d fields .",
    "the stokes parameters provide geometric information about the polarization ellipse ; i.e. , the ellipse that the electric field tip traces out during one optical cycle . the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 carry information about the alignment of the ellipse axes , while @xmath22 gives the ellipse area , signed according to polarization handedness .",
    "if the relation between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 is completely deterministic , the field is fully polarized .",
    "for such a pure state ( borrowing the terminology from quantum optics ) , the polarization matrix is idempotent , i.e. , @xmath23 and we get @xmath24 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the components of the field are fully uncorrelated , the off - diagonal elements are zero .",
    "if , in addition , the energy is distributed evenly between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 components , @xmath25 and we have @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to the important decomposition of @xmath8 into fully polarized and unpolarized parts , viz .",
    ", @xmath27   \\varrho_{\\mathrm{unpol } } +     \\mathbb{p}^{(2 ) }    \\varrho_{\\mathrm{pol } } \\ , .\\ ] ] in this way , @xmath28 appears as the proportion of the energy of the fully polarized part from the total energy , which gives a transparent physical meaning to the definition of @xmath28 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath28 can be written in a slightly different yet equivalent way , @xmath29 as can be checked by a direct calculation . in the first form , the degree of polarization seems to be intimately linked to @xmath30 , which , following again a quantum jargon , is called the purity . in the second form",
    ", it can be immediately related with the eigenvalues of @xmath8 : if we denote them by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , ( @xmath33 ) , then @xmath34 and @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 the importance of which will soon become apparent .",
    "polarization transformations are generated by wave plates and represented by @xmath37 unitary matrices of su(2 )  @xcite , @xmath38 where @xmath39 denote the euler angles .",
    "the action of these transformations on the polarization matrix is via conjugation , @xmath40 which , in turn , induces rotations on the stokes vector @xmath18 , as confirmed by the well - known relation between su(2 ) and the group of rotations so(3 )  @xcite .",
    "the essential point is that @xmath41 is clearly unchanged by these transformations .",
    "next , we loosen the restriction to planar geometry and examine the behavior of electric fields having three nonvanishing components , in directions we denote as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "now , the vibrations of the field are not constrained to a plane and the polarization must be described by a @xmath42 matrix @xmath43 the superscript 3 labels the 3d approach and will be dropped when the context is clear .    if all of the components are completely uncorrelated ( and their energies are equal ) the field is unpolarized and its direction is random .",
    "if one of the components has less energy than the other two , the vibrations are less random and , consequently , the field is more polarized than in the equal - energy case .",
    "this means that any field having only two non - vanishing components is never unpolarized in the 3d sense , regardless of the correlations between the components .",
    "hence , a planar field , which is commonly called unpolarized in 2d , is not fully unpolarized but partially polarized in a 3d description .    as in 2d",
    ", the field is called fully polarized if all of the field components are completely correlated . hence , in contrast to an unpolarized field , a planar field that is fully polarized is always fully polarized also in the 3d sense .",
    "one of the most remarkable differences between 2d and 3d is that the @xmath42 polarization matrix can not be generally expressed as a sum of unpolarized and fully polarized parts  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if one desires to define a degree of polarization for arbitrary electric fields , the approach taken in must be abandoned .    in any event",
    ", the @xmath44 polarization matrix can be expanded in a basis as @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the gell - mann matrices ( see details in the appendix ) .",
    "the corresponding coordinates of the eight - dimensional stokes vector can be obtained as @xmath47 we have introduced the factor @xmath48 in such a way that for a pure state @xmath49",
    "@xcite , although other choices can be found in the literature .",
    "one first option would be to define  @xcite @xmath50 i.e. , again the length of the stokes vector , which is readily shown to verify @xmath51 .",
    "although this is mathematically correct , it is not clear physically what @xmath52 represents . unlike in 2d , where the stokes vector represents the complete state of polarization and can be easily visualized , the generalized stokes vector is eight dimensional and the geometrical space supporting this vector is not intuitive at all .    an alternative is to generalize in a way so as to get the appropriate normalization ; it reads  @xcite @xmath53 the drawback of this definition is that it can not be understood as a portion of the energy of the fully polarized part from the total energy and hence its physical properties need further examination .",
    "finally , the generalization of seems even more dubious , since now we have three different eigenvalues .",
    "this reveals the major problem when extending 2d to 3d instances : while one parameter is enough to specify the degree of polarization in 2d , two independent parameters are , in general , needed when considering 3d , which makes the transition a tricky business .",
    "we complete this section by describing the polarization transformations possible in the 3d case : they are represented by @xmath44 matrices of su(3 ) , which we write as  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an octuple of euler - like angles @xmath56 and the set @xmath57 comprises su(2 ) subgroup matrices @xmath58 or @xmath59 depending on the values of @xmath60 .",
    "also , @xmath61 equation  ( [ su3 ] ) factorizes then into su(2 ) submatrices , with parameters defined by the corresponding euler angles .",
    "the action of these transformations on @xmath8 is via conjugation as in , which induces rotations on the vector @xmath18 .",
    "however , one word of caution seems pertinent here : there is no obvious physical interpretation via optical elements of su(3 ) transformations , as now the plane waves averaging to the @xmath62 polarization matrix do not share a common propagation direction , in general .",
    "any physical device represented by a su(3 ) transformation should be insensitive to the propagation directions of the separate members of the ensemble  @xcite .    despite the recent progress achieved in the control and manipulation of 3d polarization  @xcite , we are still far from having at our disposal an su(3 ) gadget , in sharp contrast with the simplicity of su(2 ) . given these experimental difficulties , one might be tempted to consider invariance only under rotations and inversions ; that is , a field is less polarized at a point if its behavior is fairly unchanged after we rotate it and reflect it around that point .",
    "although attractive , this proposal does not allow us to find analytical results in what follows .",
    "accordingly , we take su(3 ) as the symmetry of the problem , even if its operational implementation may be elusive .",
    "as heralded in the introduction , our proposal for the degree of polarization starts from the _ ansatz _ @xmath63 here , the @xmath64 is taken over su(2 ) or su(3 ) , depending on the appropriate situation .",
    "in addition , @xmath65 stands for any measure of distance between the polarization matrices @xmath8 and @xmath66 .",
    "it is clear that there are numerous nontrivial choices for @xmath67 ( by nontrivial we mean that the choice is not a simple scale transformation of any other distance ) .",
    "none of them could be said to be more important than any other _ a priori _ , but the significance of each candidate would have to be seen through physical assumptions . in our case , we take the hilbert - schmidt distance @xmath68 \\nonumber \\\\    & = &     \\frac{1}{2 } [   { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits } ( \\varrho^{2 } )   + { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}(\\varrho^{\\prime 2 } ) -     2 { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits } ( \\varrho \\varrho^{\\prime } ) ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath69 and @xmath70 , this distance reduces to @xmath71     ( lower arm ) with its su(@xmath72 ) transformed partners ( upper arm ) .",
    "the distinguishability is related to the visibility of the interference pattern at the detector @xmath73 . ]",
    "consequently , we define a hilbert - schmidt degree of polarization as @xmath74^{2 } =     \\sup_{g \\in \\mathrm{su(n ) } }   d^{2}_{\\mathrm{hs } } ( \\rho,\\rho_g )    = { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits } ( \\rho^2 ) -     \\inf_{g \\in \\mathrm{su(n ) } }   \\ ,   { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits } ( \\varrho   \\varrho_g ) \\ , .\\ ] ] the appealing point is that , formulated in this way , @xmath75 depends on both the purity of the state and the distinguishability between the state and of its rotated counterparts .",
    "this later magnitude can be directly determined as the visibility of an interference experiment , as roughly schematized in fig .  1 .",
    "as unpolarized states are invariant under any su(@xmath72 ) transformation , this visibility ( which is a measure of the distinguishability between @xmath8 and @xmath76 ) is zero for them .",
    "let us put the general definition to work for the 2d case .",
    "the state purity and the distinguishability can be expressed as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the stokes vectors associated with @xmath8 and @xmath76 , respectively .    to find the minimum overlap",
    ", we follow a route that will be useful in extending this to the 3d case : one notices that any state @xmath8 can be brought to a diagonal form @xmath80 , with @xmath81 being an su(2 ) matrix and @xmath82 as @xmath83 , we get @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the corresponding euler angle in .",
    "the minimum corresponds when @xmath86 is the antipodal vector @xmath87 , as one might have anticipated .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath88 which shows that the hilbert - schmidt @xmath89 is proportional to the trace distance .",
    "this reinforces the connection to distinguishability as a measure of the degree of polarization , since the trace distance is a preferred metric to quantify the distinguishability between probability distributions  @xcite .",
    "now , we have that @xmath90 this last equation is surprisingly simple , but due to restrictions imposed by the su(3 ) algebra , @xmath78 and @xmath79 can not be antiparallel .",
    "thus , to optimize this distinguishability , we write again @xmath91 , with @xmath92 with the eigenvalues sorted in decreasing order : @xmath93 .",
    "the vector @xmath94 associated with @xmath95 has two nonzero components : @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and the minimum overlap depends now on these two parameters .",
    "in addition , positivity imposes @xmath98 this defines a triangular region of the plane similar to the one investigated in ref .",
    "the minimization is now more involved , and we distinguish two different situations :      this corresponds to a density matrix with two identical eigenvalues : @xmath100 a direct numerical search shows that the minimum is reached when @xmath86 is obtained from @xmath94 by the linear transformation @xmath101",
    "so we have @xmath102 . as explained above",
    ", the optimal angle between @xmath94 and @xmath103 is not @xmath104 because this angle lies outside the permitted range .",
    "that not all angles are permitted can be explained by the fact that @xmath95 and @xmath105 must have the same eigenvalues since they are unitarily related .",
    "one can confirm that the rotated vector @xmath86 corresponds to the largest eigenvalue being permuted with one of the smaller .",
    "hence , we can recast the infimum as tr@xmath106 , so the degree becomes @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( here , @xmath110 ) . in this way",
    ", it appears as the natural generalization of the 2d version .",
    "the three eigenvalues are now different .",
    "we set @xmath112 and write @xmath113    we have to consider three different zones :    * @xmath114 .",
    "the minimum is found when the angles @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 are respectively set to @xmath118 in the su(3 ) matrix and the rest of the angles equal 0 .",
    "then , @xmath119 in reproduces this minimum .",
    "* @xmath120 .",
    "the minimum is now found when the angles @xmath121 and @xmath117 take the values @xmath122 in . here ,",
    "@xmath123 in gives the correct result .",
    "* @xmath124 . here",
    ", the minimum occurs for @xmath125 , corresponding to the angle @xmath126 in .",
    "the transformed density matrix accounts for a reshuffling of the eigenvalues and by simple inspection one can check that holds for all three cases .    additional insight can be gained by considering a three - dimensional plot illustrating the loci of the minima and a contour plot of these points , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : starfish ] .",
    "the 6-fold symmetry of the result ( corresponding to the six possible permutations of @xmath127 , so they remain in decreasing order ) is explicit and quite similar to the symmetry exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the hilbert - schmidt degree ( [ eq : opdefopt2 ] ) admits a direct 3d translation , namely , @xmath128    in this respect , it is worth stressing that several 3d measures have already been introduced in terms of the eigenvalues of the @xmath44 polarization matrix .",
    "relevant examples are  @xcite @xmath129 here , @xmath130 measures the strength of the pure polarized component , @xmath131 is the strength of the unpolarized component , and @xmath132 is the strength of the component that is unpolarized within a plane . in ref .",

    "the figure is so explicit that it does not deserve many additional comments .",
    "what is really remarkable is how differently these measures quantify the polarization at the apices of the triangle .",
    "we have explored the use of a degree of polarization based on the distance of a state to the set of its rotated counterparts . such a definition",
    "is closely related to other recent proposals in different areas of quantum optics and is well behaved in the classical domain , providing an operational approach that can be extended from the 2d formalism ( where it reproduces the standard results ) to the 3d case ( where it gives a new measure ) .",
    "the resulting degree is tightly linked to the notion of distinguishability , which can be experimentally determined as the visibility in a simple interference setup , which confirms previous contentions along the same lines  @xcite .",
