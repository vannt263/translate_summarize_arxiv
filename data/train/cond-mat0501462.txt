    "strongly correlated electron metals have been for a long time now one of the most fruitful fields for the discovery of new physical phenomena ( heavy fermions , non - fermi - liquids ( nfl ) , quantum critical points ( qcp ) or unconventional superconductivity ) , some of them pointing towards a possible new description of the quasiparticles ground state . at the same time , the study of such magnetic compounds has provided new insight into the understanding of the basic magnetic interactions ( rkky , 4f-3d hybridization , crystal electric field , etc . ) and the interplay between them .    in many of these systems an additional problem appears when we are dealing with atomic substitutions .",
    "this problem is described in general as `` disorder effects '' and could consist of compositional local inhomogeneities , phase coexistence , and clusterization processes that in most cases are intrinsic to the samples and can not be avoided by means of different preparation methods or supplementary thermal treatments .",
    "specific heat measurements ( @xmath4 ) provide a powerful method for studying the behavior of these compounds@xcite because :    * the magnetic contribution to the specific heat and the corresponding magnetic entropy are related to the energy levels of the magnetic ions ( cerium in our case ) and the shape of the anomalies corresponding to the magnetic phase transition gives a valuable indication as to the nature of the transition .",
    "* the electronic coefficient @xmath5 provides relevant information concerning the conduction band density of states at the fermi level .",
    "* at higher temperatures the shape of the thermal variation of the specific heat depends on the crystal electric field splitting .",
    "* the very low temperature @xmath6 behavior can show departures from the predictions of the fermi - liquid theory,@xcite which could serve as the sign of the different scenarios devoted to explaining the physics involved in these processes ( spin fluctuations that exist close to a qpc,@xcite griffiths phase situation,@xcite disorder - driven mechanisms as `` kondo disorder'',@xcite etc . ) .",
    "all these features can be used in the analysis of the ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1 system , which has been studied over the last few years with different macroscopic and microscopic techniques such as magnetization , resistivity , neutron diffraction , @xmath2sr spectroscopy , etc .",
    "the main features of this system at the present stage can be summarized as follows :    * a complex magnetic behavior was determined@xcite with a change from an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ( cecu ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground state well characterized by neutron diffraction in ceni@xmath7cu@xmath8 ( ref .  ) evolving towards the evanescence of the long - range magnetic order around ceni@xmath9cu@xmath10 . *",
    "a `` spin - glass - like '' phase was surprisingly found at temperatures above the ferromagnetic order state.@xcite a `` cluster - glass '' scenario seems the most plausible hypothesis according to ac and dc magnetization measurements.@xcite * in fact , recent @xmath2sr studies confirm the presence of a highly inhomogeneous magnetic state at temperatures extending from the long - range ordered ground state to the paramagnetic regime .",
    "this inhomogeneous magnetic state consists of long - range ordered and nonordered fractions , the latter increasing with temperature.@xcite * the ni - rich part of the diagram is very sensitive to thermal treatments due to the proximity to the crystalline structural change ( feb to crb).@xcite there appears a marked decrease in magnetization as a consequence of the strong reduction of the magnetic ce moments due to the increasing hybridization effects .",
    "some traces of hysteresis however , have been detected at very low temperatures in the ceni@xmath11cu@xmath12 and ceni@xmath13cu@xmath14 compounds that show that the magnetic moments have not been completely exhausted yet.@xcite    many questions still await answers in order for there to be a full understanding of such complex behavior .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how the specific heat measurements performed in these series between 0.2 k and 300 k provide valuable information that sheds light on the underlying physics in the system .",
    "starting in the first part of the article with a detailed presentation of the preparation methods , crystallography , and quality control of the samples , we go on to present the specific heat measurements and their corresponding analysis .",
    "special care has been taken in order to elucidate the nature of the anomalies found in these compounds .",
    "particular attention has been paid to the analysis of the low temperature regime at the compositional region near the magnetic - nonmagnetic crossover .",
    "the specific heat measurements in the range 0.2 k@xmath15@xmath16@xmath156 k were performed at the instituto de ciencia de materiales de aragn on a fully automated quasiadiabatic calorimeter@xcite refrigerated by adiabatic demagnetization of a paramagnetic salt@xcite using the heat pulse technique and germanium thermometry over the whole temperature range .",
    "small ingots of around 0.5 g weight were used for the measurement , mixed with apiezon n grease to achieve good thermal contact between the sample and the calorimetric set ( heater and thermometer ) even at the lowest temperature .",
    "the calorimeter is equipped with a mechanical switch that allows temperatures down to 0.2 k to be reached .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the instrument has been estimated to be about 1% .",
    "the calorimetric data between 2 k and 300 k were obtained in a commercial quantum design microcalorimeter at the university of cantabria using the relaxation technique . in this case ,",
    "thin slab shape samples 0.5 mm thick and weighing around 8 mg were used .",
    "matching between both sets of data in the common temperature range is quite satisfactory .",
    "the samples in the present work are those with @xmath17=0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , and 0.9 .",
    "they are all polycrystalline samples prepared by carefully melting together stoichiometric amounts of the appropriate high - purity starting elements in an arc melting furnace under inert ar atmosphere .",
    "five melts were performed with flipping of the arc - melted button between melts in order to improve homogeneity .",
    "the crystalline structures of the ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1 compounds studied have been determined by x - ray diffraction at 300 k. the alloys with @xmath17@xmath180.15 crystallize in the feb - type orthorhombic structure ( pnma space group ) , whereas the alloys with @xmath17@xmath190.15 crystallize in the crb- type orthorhombic structure ( cmcm space group).@xcite both crystalline structures are built from ce trigonal prisms ( with a transition metal in the center ) .",
    "both structures only differ in the relative disposition of the trigonal prisms , which is the reason why ce - ce and ce-(ni , cu ) distances evolve continuously from one structure to the other.@xcite    the rietveld analyses were performed considering ni and cu atoms randomly distributed on the same 4c site while the ce lies on the other 4c site .",
    "the narrowness of the x - ray peaks of the as - quenched samples spectra guarantees the good crystallization of the samples except for the cu - rich ones ; i. e. , @xmath17=0.8 and 0.9 , which showed a broadening of the diffraction peaks . a high vacuum annealing at 425 @xmath20c ( just below the melting point of cecu ) for one week",
    "was carried out on the samples with @xmath17@xmath180.2 .",
    "noticeable narrowing of the peaks was induced only for @xmath17=0.8 and 0.9 samples , whereas no significant modifications were observed for any of the other compositions .",

    "the solid line is drawn as a guide only .",
    "the dashed lines set the crossover between the two compositional regimes defined in the text.,width=264 ]    returning to the @xmath5 evolution for the ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1 system displayed in the same plot , we became aware of the coincidence of the @xmath5 variation between both series for ni content larger than 0.5 , whereas the compounds closer to cecu follow a different trend from the ceni@xmath23pt@xmath24 series .",
    "thus , that comparison allows dividing the behavior of the series into two main composition regimes .",
    "hence , the first regime would range from cecu to ceni@xmath7cu@xmath8 , where the values of @xmath5 do not significantly change .",
    "this region corresponds to the composition regime where the evolution from an afm ( cecu ) to fm ( ceni@xmath7cu@xmath8 ) ground state occurs , giving rise to complex ordered spin structures as has been established from neutron diffraction.@xcite this evolution is considered to be caused by the enhancement of the ferromagnetic interactions closely related to the change in the density of states at the fermi surface driven by the differences in d - electron density between cu and ni@xcite and it has been also found in similar rni@xmath0cu@xmath1 series with light@xcite and heavy rare - earths.@xcite    the evolution from ceni@xmath7cu@xmath8 to ceni defines the second regime .",
    "once the fm ground state sets in , the competition between rkky , predominantly ferromagnetic , and kondo interactions leads the system from a magnetic localized to a delocalized pauli paramagnetic state ( ceni ) , and this competition defines the second regime . in that regime , the coefficient @xmath5 is enhanced for compounds with increasing hybridization favored by the decreasing cell volume , reaching values of more than 200 mj / k@xmath26 mol around the @xmath17=0.15 composition .",
    "let us come back to the cell volume variations of both series displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in spite of the change in crystallographic structure existing in ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1",
    ", the cell volume evolves similarly for both series , having both cept and cecu nearly the same value of the cell volume .",
    "they do , however , have to be distinguished .",
    "while in ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1 the random substitution on the nonmagnetic site ni / cu not only changes the cell volume but also modifies the electronic state ( by changing the number of conduction electrons ) , in the ceni@xmath23pt@xmath24 case the ni / pt substitution only modifies the cell volume .",
    "however , the evolution of @xmath5 is the same in both series in the thus defined second regime in ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath5 was explained in ceni@xmath23pt@xmath24 as driven by the competition between rkky and kondo interactions under an internal molecular field@xcite according to ; @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the zeeman energy of the magnetic moment associated with a ce@xmath29 ion within the molecular field created by the other ions .",
    "then , it is deduced from the previous comparison that the electronic effects do not play a predominant role in the balance between rkky and 4f - conduction band hybridization of the second regime .",
    "it can thus be concluded that the driving parameters of the @xmath5 behavior in this region are the interatomic distances rather than the electronic effects .",
    "the magnetic contribution to the specific heat c@xmath31 has been estimated for all the compounds by taking as the lattice contribution of each magnetic compound that of the isomorphous nonmagnetic one after taking into account the mass corrections.@xcite thus , the specific heat of lani@xcite has been taken as the nonmagnetic reference for the crb - type structure compounds ( @xmath17=0.1 and 0.15 ) while for the rest of the compositions ( feb - type structure ) the specific heat of yni was used . using this procedure , @xmath30 reflects any effect related to the magnetic order transition and/or the temperature dependence of the electronic term .",
    "[ fig5 ] displays @xmath30 as a function of the temperature in the low temperature range for both regimes as defined in the previous section .",

    "[ fig5]a illustrates the region 1@xmath18@xmath17@xmath180.6 where the evolution from an afm to a fm ground state occurs due to the modifications of the positive and negative rkky interactions .",
    "[ fig5]b shows @xmath30 for compounds with @xmath17@xmath150.6 , where the magnetic ground state evolves from ferromagnetism to a pauli paramagnetic state ( ceni ) .",
    "starting from the cu rich side , ceni@xmath14cu@xmath13 shows an anomaly at the critical temperature ( @xmath32 ) corresponding to the antiferromagnetic transition ( @xmath33=2.5 k ) defined as the inflection point above the maximum of the @xmath30 curve .",
    "the anomaly becomes broader and its maximum value decreases as ni content increases , it being significantly reduced for the @xmath17=0.6 compound , which shows a broad hump centered at about 2 k. it is worth noting the smooth variation of @xmath30 above the ordering temperature for these compounds .",
    "these effects are related to the existence of a short - range magnetic order well above @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , the competition between positive and negative interactions leads to complex ordered spin structures , as was corroborated by neutron diffraction.@xcite in addition , quasielastic neutron scattering ( qens ) carried out in @xmath17=0.9 , 0.8 , and 0.6@xcite indicated a supplementary inelastic gaussian contribution persisting up to @xmath343@xmath32 , which becomes more important as cu content increases ( i. e. , as the exchange interactions became more significant ) .",
    "all these features support the predominant role played by rkky interactions in setting the magnetic ground state in this regime .",
    "we note a perceptible change in @xmath30 between @xmath17=0.6 and @xmath17=0.5 . instead of a hump , ceni@xmath35cu@xmath35 exhibits a clear @xmath36-type anomaly , with a critical temperature @xmath32=2.3 k. this anomaly becomes even sharper for ceni@xmath8cu@xmath7 and shifts slightly up to t@xmath37=2.5 k. for the following compounds , the anomaly broadens and its maximum value decreases with the increasing ni content .",
    "thus , for compositions with @xmath17@xmath150.2 , the anomaly in @xmath30 can not be distinctly defined .    the temperature corresponding to the maximum of the magnetic specific heat coincides with the freezing temperature ( @xmath3 ) determined by ac magnetic susceptibility measurements , which for the compounds in this second regime was associated with a `` spin - glass - like '' state developing at temperatures above the long - range ferromagnetic order.@xcite microscopic studies , performed with @xmath2sr in order to shed light on the nature and origin of these transitions , claimed for an intermediate inhomogeneous magnetic state above t@xmath38 evolving into a long - range ordered state at lower temperatures .",
    "however , from the specific heat point of view , no other transitions were observed at temperatures below the maxima .",
    "this feature agrees with the idea of a continuous evolution ( better than a second order phase transition ) to the long - range ordered state found from neutron and muon results at low temperatures.@xcite the first calorimetric studies presented in ceni@xmath7cu@xmath8 revealed a very narrow peak at 1 k.@xcite the actual measurement in this composition is identical to the already published one except for that feature .",
    "we should bear in mind that ref .",
    "was the first in - depth study on one composition of the ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1 series and , at that point when even the magnetic phase diagram of the series was unknown , we were not aware of the enormous relevance of a meticulous characterization of the samples .",
    "in fact , the sample reported in ref .   was melted in an induction furnace and its degree of inhomogeneity was not as well characterized as in the present study .    taking a look at the very low temperature side of the @xmath39 vs @xmath16 curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , we can observe an almost constant behavior for ceni@xmath11cu@xmath12 and ceni@xmath13cu@xmath14 .",
    "this fact indicates the fermi - liquid character of these compounds .",
    "it should be remarked that the fermi - liquid theory should only be applied at very low temperatures where it describes the low lying excitations of the quasiparticles ( interacting fermions ) .",
    "however , it is usually assumed that this label is extended to compounds presenting a constant electronic specific heat and magnetic susceptibility coefficient and a @xmath21 dependence of the electrical resistivity .",
    "this is the case of the @xmath39 corresponding to the @xmath17=0.1 and 0.15 compounds .",
    "@xmath39 vs. @xmath16 representation of the specific heat for ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1 in the compositions studied .",
    "the inset shows the variation for the compounds near the magnetic - nonmagnetic crossover @xmath17=0.1 , 0.15 , and 0.2.,width=264 ]    in f - electron compounds , strong electronic correlations can lead to anomalous low - temperature properties indicating that the system changes from a nonmagnetic to a magnetic ground state as a certain parameter such as concentration or pressure is tuned .",
    "typically , the nfl behavior is associated to a diverging specific heat @xmath39 when approaching @xmath16=0 k , while the fermi - liquid theory predicts a constant value.@xcite    in ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1 , the whole set of measurements traces a crossover from magnetic order to pauli paramagnetic behavior , thereby crossing some critical concentration range where long - range order is expected to vanish .",
    "therefore , one might ask if nfl behavior might arise in this system . in that sense , what is remarkable is the divergence of the @xmath39 curve at low temperatures for the @xmath17=0.2 compound .",
    "we are tempted to attribute the origin of this divergence to its being due to the critical concentration where long - range magnetic order is suppressed , and then presenting a nfl behavior as in other series exhibiting , in principle , a similar scenario .",
    "however , the existence of a transition at lower temperature can not fully be ruled out .",
    "the low temperature dependence of @xmath39 must be carefully analyzed in this case .",
    "in fact , as we mentioned in the introduction , very low temperature studies by both macroscopic ( ac and dc measurements)@xcite and microscopic ( @xmath2sr ) techniques@xcite in the compositions around @xmath17=0.2 revealed that the magnetic moments are not yet exhausted . however , long - range magnetic order , if it exists , can not be detected by neutron diffraction ( within the resolution of the available experiments ) since we are dealing with very reduced values of the magnetic moment .",
    "both experiments point towards some kind of short - range ordered states and reveal evidence of spin - glass arrangements even for the @xmath17=0.1 compound.@xcite then , on the basis of all these results we have to discard an intrinsic electronic effect leading to nfl or quantum phase transition around the @xmath17=0.2 compound .",
    "the divergence on @xmath39 could be related to the existence of a small anomaly at lower temperatures as was found at very low temperature in ac susceptibility measurements.@xcite      the magnetic entropies have been calculated from @xmath40 and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] versus the reduced temperature ( @xmath16/@xmath32 ) for the most significant compounds .",

    "the more simple the structure is with well - defined anisotropy , the sharper the increase of the entropy is , defining a clear change of slope at @xmath32 .",
    "this is the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] where for the afm complex structures ( @xmath17=0.8 and 0.9 ) a slow and progressive increase is observed , whereas for the fm one ( @xmath17=0.4 ) the increase is sharper and a net knee is observed at t@xmath37 .",
    "it must be stressed , however , that in this ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1 series these variations are quite smooth even in the case of fm compounds , indicating a high degree of magnetic disorder .",

    "solid lines correspond to the paramagnetic cef contribution ( see text ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the main transitions in the cef level scheme.,width=264 ]    in all the compounds the magnetic entropy at @xmath32 is lower than r@xmath43ln2=5.76 j / k mol , the value expected from a doublet ground state , which is the one presented by the ce@xmath29 ion under an orthorhombic framework .",
    "the reasons for such a reduction are at least two : the first one is the complexity of the magnetic order with the existence of short - range interactions above @xmath32 ; this should be the main effect in compounds close to the cecu limit .",
    "the value of the entropy at @xmath32 decreases as the structure become more complex ( rkky competing interactions being the predominant effect ) .",
    "the second is the kondo effect , which reduces the value of the magnetic moment that is the dominant effect once the ferromagnetic order is established ( @xmath17@xmath150.6 ) and the kondo interactions become more important .",
    "this reduction of the magnetic moment has been confirmed by neutron and muon experiments.@xcite    from this last assumption a @xmath44 value can be estimated considering the reduction of the magnetic entropy at @xmath32 from the value of r@xmath43ln2.@xcite using a simple two - level model with an energy splitting of @xmath45 , we can calculate the reduced entropy at @xmath32 as : @xmath46 + { { t_k } \\over { t_c}}\\left [ { { { \\exp \\left ( { { { -t_k } \\over { t_c } } } \\right ) } \\over   { 1+\\exp \\left ( { { { -t_k } \\over { t_c } } } \\right ) } } } \\right]\\ ] ]    this expression must be applied for transitions at @xmath32 to long - range magnetic order which is not really the case in our compounds with @xmath17@xmath190.6 . in this case",
    "the specific heat anomaly at @xmath32 is related to the spin freezing temperature .",
    "however , the frozen state in these samples is a cluster - glass with ferromagnetic correlations inside the clusters .",
    "so , even if some fraction of the entropy is invested in the disorder among the clusters , this approach can give us an estimate of the kondo temperatures in order to follow their compositional evolution .",
    "for the compounds with no anomaly in @xmath30 ( @xmath17@xmath150.2 ) , the estimation of @xmath44 requires another kind of analysis . from the sacramento and schlottmann calculations for a j=1/2",
    "impurity,@xcite one could estimate @xmath44 as the value at which 45% of the total r@xmath43ln2 entropy is recovered .",
    "taking into account the perturbation induced by the short - range order correlations and the two different methods used to estimate the @xmath44 values , these results must be looked at with care .",
    "table  [ table2 ] summarizes the values obtained for @xmath44 in each composition . in the same table we also present the values of @xmath44 estimated from susceptibility@xcite as @xmath47 , qens@xcite , and resistivity as t@xmath48/5.@xcite    it is clear that the right estimate of @xmath44 comes from qens@xcite where the quasielastic signal is directly related to the kondo temperature .",
    "the values of @xmath44 obtained from the magnetic entropy are clearly overestimated due to the entropy associated to the cluster - glass formation .",
    "the most interesting feature in all these estimates of @xmath44 is that , in spite of the different magnitudes due to the different time scales of the techniques,@xcite the same relative variation of @xmath44 is found with increasing ni content .",
    "apart from short - range order correlations that might be present above the critical temperature , the contribution to @xmath30 above @xmath32 arises from cef . due to the low symmetry site occupied by the ce@xmath29 ions in this system , the j=5/2 multiplet splits into three doublets , with the excited states separated from the ground state by energy gaps @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "this section is devoted to analyzing the behavior of the series , based on both the present and the previous studies carried out so far .",
    "first , we must remember the division of the series into two regimes with respect to the heat capacity findings .",
    "although the competing interactions are present throughout the series , heat capacity reflects that the interplay of the interactions and its magnitude are tuned by the composition .",
    "thus , we have defined a first regime where the competing exchange interactions are predominant ( 0.9@xmath19@xmath17@xmath150.6 ) , giving rise to a change from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism .",
    "the second regime is characterized by the increasing kondo effect driven by the decreasing cell volume .",
    "as the kondo effect becomes more important , the ce magnetic moments become smaller and the effective magnetic interaction decreases .    in this second regime",
    "the general behavior is the same as that expected for a kondo lattice system and the electronic coefficient , @xmath5 , evolves similarly as in the ceni@xmath23pt@xmath24 series,@xcite a clear example of a doniach predicted behavior .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath5 corresponds to the composition where kondo interactions overcome the molecular field effects and then , long - range magnetic order is hard to reach . for compounds presenting higher ni content",
    ", @xmath5 behaves as in the nonordered heavy fermion compounds @xmath51 . in our case , however , important magnetic disorder effects still prevail .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic moments are not completely exhausted and they can arrange at very low temperatures .    the complex magnetic behavior and the evolution of the interactions in this series can be condensed in the sketch picture displayed in fig .  [ fig10 ] .",
    "previous bulk data suggested the existence of a spin - glass - like phase ( cluster - glass in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) appearing in a certain compositional range of this series at the freezing temperature @xmath3.@xcite in addition , long - range ferromagnetic order at very low temperatures has been confirmed by neutron diffraction and @xmath2sr studies at least down to the composition with @xmath17=0.2.@xcite the low temperature specific heat for these compounds exhibits marked anomalies at the freezing temperature @xmath3 detected by ac susceptibility .",
    "the shape of these anomalies , however , differs from what is expected around the freezing temperature in a canonical spin - glass .",
    "so far , a lot of experimental data on the magnetic heat capacity behavior of `` spin - glass '' systems are available and few analytical expressions have been used to reproduce the data for the different samples.@xcite furthermore , the `` spin - glass '' label has been used to refer to many different situations ranging from canonical spin - glass ( i.e. individual spins ) to magnetic ground states close to superparamagnetism ( i.e. noninteracting magnetic spin clusters ) . that is the reason why some of the spin - glass properties do not seem to be universal . in particular , it is usually assumed that the magnetic contribution to the specific heat shows no sharp anomaly at the freezing temperature , as found in other heavy fermion intermetallic compounds with spin - glass - like behavior : u@xmath42pdsi@xmath52 ( ref .  ) , urh@xmath42ge@xmath42 ( ref .  ) , and more recently ceni@xmath42sn@xmath42 ( ref .  ) .",
    "our data do not conform with this common phenomenology although the magnetic macroscopic measurements clearly point to a spin - glass - like behavior .",

    "that percentage is slightly higher than those reported for the crystalline dilute spin - glass systems mncu , or aufe ( 22 - 33%),@xcite even taking into account the entropy reduction due to the kondo effect in our samples .",
    "compared with our data , a similar specific heat and magnetic entropy behavior was also found in amorphous gd@xmath53al@xmath54 ( ref .  ) and er@xmath55ni@xmath55 ( ref .  )",
    "alloys . in addition , for those compounds the magnetic specific heat showed a @xmath56 temperature dependence , indicating a collective excitation .",
    "these results indicate that ferromagnetic - like spin waves can be excited in these amorphous alloys , although the overall magnetic structure is not ferromagnetic but rather spin - glass . fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] displays the temperature dependence of our magnetic specific heat in the form @xmath30 versus @xmath56 dependence for the ferromagnetic compounds @xmath17=0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , and 0.6 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath30 follows the @xmath56 dependence up to about 0.7@xmath3 in a similar manner as observed in the amorphous compounds cited above .",
    "the existence of these ferromagnetic correlations yields a faster enhancement of the magnetic entropy than that of a canonical spin - glass ( linear with temperature ) .",
    "then , the maximum value of the specific heat has to be reached at a lower temperature than the 1.6@xmath3 expected value,@xcite as happens in our series .",
    "temperature dependence of the magnetic contribution to the specific heat @xmath30 for the fm compounds @xmath17=0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , and 0.6 in the form @xmath30 versus @xmath56 .",
    "the data corresponding to different compounds are shifted for clarity.,width=264 ]    neutron diffraction experiments at very low temperature have been conclusive to ascertain the existence of long - range ferromagnetic order in @xmath17=0.6 , 0.5 , and 0.4.@xcite neutron scattering is primarily a probe of long - range correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath2sr spectroscopy is a much more local probe than neutron scattering , and needs no large coherence length .",
    "consequently , it is particularly sensitive to short - range order and other forms of disordered magnetism.@xcite our @xmath2sr results indicate the existence of an inhomogeneous magnetic state at temperatures above the freezing temperature t@xmath38 ( seen by ac - susceptibility ) that runs into the paramagnetic regime .",
    "the basic feature of this intermediate state is the coexistence of ordered and nonordered fractions .",
    "the latter decreases as the temperature is lowered until t@xmath38 is reached . below t@xmath38 , long - range order , from the @xmath2sr perspective,@xcite prevails . nevertheless , it must be stressed that this long - range ordered state detected by muons presents strong local magnetic disorder as reflected by the wide field distribution on the muon site arising from those analyses .",
    "this distribution leads to the fast damping of the oscillatory pattern observed in the series.@xcite    it is worth remembering the difference in the time window for the study of spin dynamical processes when comparing the different experimental techniques used so far ( i.e. ac susceptibility , specific heat , neutron diffraction , and @xmath2sr spectroscopy ) .",
    "each technique can access a different characteristic range of the rate of spin fluctuations and hence provides different information concerning dynamical processes developing in the system .",
    "the combination of all the techniques , however , yields a complete dynamical picture of the system since @xmath2sr bridges the gap between neutron scattering on the one side and bulk magnetic measurements on the other.@xcite    considering our experimental results as a whole , we can propose a convenient description of our system .",
    "although x - ray , neutron diffraction , and scanning microscopy reflect a clear homogeneity of the samples at the micrometric level , we can ensure that inhomogeneities in the random distribution of cu and ni appear at the nanometric scale . when temperature is lowered from the paramagnetic state , zones or clusters of magnetic moments develop due to the increasing short - range magnetic interactions .",
    "these clusters freeze at @xmath3 losing their dynamical aspect . at lower temperatures",
    "the magnetic clusters interact among one another and percolate giving rise to a long - range ferromagnetic state at very low temperatures , in agreement with the ferromagnetic excitations detected by specific heat below @xmath3 .",
    "this percolative process scenario , reminiscent of that proposed by dagotto in manganites,@xcite is also present in many substitutional systems such as semiconductors , high @xmath32 superconductors , etc.@xcite the ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1 is , thus , a clear example of strongly correlated electron system presenting a percolative scenario .    in the compound with @xmath17=0.2 ,",
    "the inhomogeneous magnetic state , where ordered and nonordered fractions coexist , extends over a wider temperature range .",
    "full long - range ordered state has been only detected by @xmath2sr and ac susceptibility below t@xmath340.5 k.@xcite at this point we must remember that this compound was reported to be on the crossover of the localized - nonlocalized magnetism.@xcite in fact , the specific heat measurements do not show any sharp transition as in the other compounds .",
    "furthermore , recent neutron diffraction studies do not detect any magnetic contribution within the experimental limits.@xcite these results evidence how reduced the ce magnetic moments are in this alloy .",
    "being so close to the disappearance of the magnetic moment and regarding the @xmath39 behavior presented in the previous section , one could be tempted to look for a nfl behavior defining a qcp in this composition . in that sense ,",
    "[ fig12 ] shows the corresponding fits of @xmath39 for this compound to a log@xmath16 law , as observed for the case of magnetic fluctuations@xcite and a @xmath57 law as proposed by castro neto,@xcite who considered the existence of griffiths phases consisting of magnetic clusters embedded in a nonmagnetic matrix .",

    "although the agreement factor of these fits is comparable to other systems reported as non - fermi - liquids,@xcite in the present case we have powerful reasons to discard this option . on the one hand ,",
    "ac susceptibility shows the presence of a transition at very low temperatures as we pointed out above@xcite and , on the other hand , the hysteresis loops in @xmath17=0.15 and 0.1 compounds observed at very low temperatures@xcite suggest the existence of a `` cluster - glass '' state even for those compounds that macroscopically behave as fermi - liquids with almost constant @xmath39 value .    in our opinion",
    "the scenario for this series has to be understood without considering a qcp situation , but rather as only a consequence of the increasing hybridization in an intrinsic inhomogeneous state that leads to a cluster - glass situation .",
    "the more important the reduction of the magnetic moment is , the more difficult the stability of a long - range ordered state is .",
    "this interpretation resembles the situation described by coleman,@xcite where the magnetic moments still persist in the nfl regime such as is the case in mnsi.@xcite    the possibility of the scenario proposed here could be extended to other substitutional systems such as ucu@xmath63pd@xmath1 ( ref .  ) and more recently upd@xmath64sn@xmath1 ( ref .  ) and ceptsi@xmath0ge@xmath1 ( ref .  ) where intrinsic disorder effects were detected .",
    "this fact points out the importance of careful analysis of such systems close to the evanescence of the long - range magnetic order ( qcp ) .",
    "the quantum effects due to new electronic ground states must be confirmed by studies carried out in good single crystal samples and avoiding substitutional effects .",
    "ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1 is a complex system that presented many open questions concerning its magnetic behavior .",
    "the analysis of the specific heat has shed light on most of those intriguing experimental facts . in this way",
    ", it has been possible to distinguish two main concentration regimes : the first one close to the cu - rich side , where the exchange interactions are predominant and the magnetic behavior resembles our findings in other rni@xmath0cu@xmath1 series ( i.e. ndni@xmath0cu@xmath1 ( ref .  ) ) leading to changes from afm to fm ; the second one with ferromagnetic behavior , but governed by kondo interactions tending to reduce the ce magnetic moment that vanishes in the ceni compound in agreement with the doniach model , in a similar way as already found in ceni@xmath23pt@xmath24.@xcite we have also carefully investigated the possible existence of a nfl behavior for compositions close to the apparent vanishing of the long - range order and its relation to a qcp .",
    "considering the analysis of @xmath4 alone , we can report an enhanced fermi - liquid ( @xmath5=constant with temperature ) for compounds with @xmath17@xmath150.2 , and a divergence in the @xmath6 vs @xmath16 plot for @xmath17=0.2 that could be reasonably well reproduced by nfl models",
    ". however , supplementary information obtained by ac and dc susceptibility measurements confirm the existence of hysteresis loops at low temperature indicating that the magnetic moments are not fully exhausted in those compounds .",
    "qcp scenario is then not required to account for that behavior in this series .",
    "a special effort has been made to understand the magnetic contribution of @xmath4 related to the spin - glass state or the short - range magnetic ordered state .",
    "for this purpose we have considered previous @xmath2sr , neutron diffraction , and @xmath65 results , which provide different time scales of those dynamical processes .",
    "the critical temperature , @xmath32 , represents the temperature where ferromagnetic correlations are established , although full long - range order only occurs at lower temperatures . considering the overall results it has been possible to propose a convenient description of our system .",
    "its magnetic behavior can be fully described by the existence of interacting magnetic clusters that percolate , giving rise to a long - range magnetic state at very low temperatures .",
    "our results allow us to extend the large variety of examples of systems presenting intrinsic inhomogeneities that reach the long - range magnetic order by percolating processes ( semiconductors , manganites , high-@xmath32 superconductors , etc . ) to strongly correlated electron metals underlying those intrinsic disorder effects , which can not be avoided and are present in mixed or substitutional systems .",
