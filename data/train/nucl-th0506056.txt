    "the scattering of particles and ions from nuclei has provided along the years invaluable information on charge , matter , current and momentum distributions of stable isotopes . at present , efforts are devoted to investigate with such probes highly unstable isotopes at radioactive nuclear beam ( rnb ) facilities . since the first experiments @xcite it has been found from analyses of total interaction cross sections that weakly - bound neutron - rich light nuclei , e.g. @xmath0he , @xmath1li , @xmath2be , @xmath3b , have increased sizes that deviate substantially from the @xmath4 rule .",
    "it was realized ( e.g. @xcite ) that such a new phenomenon is due to the weak binding of the last few nucleons which form a diffuse nuclear cloud due to quantum - mechanical penetration ( the so called `` nuclear halo '' ) .",
    "another effect is that the nucleons can form a `` neutron skin '' @xcite when the neutrons are on average less bound than the protons . the origin of the skin lies in the large difference of the fermi energy levels of protons and neutrons so that the neutron wave function extends beyond the effectively more bound proton wave function @xcite .",
    "thus , the term `` neutron skin '' describes an excess of neutrons at the nuclear surface , whereas the `` halo '' stands for such excess plus a long tail of the neutron density distribution .",
    "most exotic nuclei are so shortlived that they can not be used as targets at rest . instead",
    ", direct reactions with rnb can be done in inverse kinematics , where the role of beam and target are interchanged .",
    "for example , proton elastic scattering angular distributions were measured at incident energies less than 100 mev / nucleon for he isotopes ( e.g. @xcite ) and li isotopes ( e.g. @xcite ) and at an energy of 700 mev / nucleon for the same nuclei at gsi ( darmstadt ) ( e.g. @xcite ) . the charge and matter distributions of these nuclei",
    "were tested in analyses of differential and total reaction cross sections of the proton scattering on exotic nuclei using different phenomenological and theoretical methods ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown ( e.g. @xcite ) that elastic scattering of protons serves as a good tool to distinguish between different models of density distributions .",
    "it was demonstrated for the case of intermediate incident energies that proton scattering in the region of small momentum transfer is particularly sensitive to the nuclear matter radius and the halo structure of nuclei @xcite .    the elastic proton scattering experiments for studying the @xmath0he , @xmath5li isotopes have been performed at gsi by using external targets . as noted in @xcite , however , the use of internal targets at storage rings in the new generation radioactive beam facilities will have advantage over external target experiments and will allow to extend such investigations to a wide range of medium and heavy nuclei .    concerning the charge distributions of nuclei",
    ", it is known that their most accurate determination can be obtained from electron - nucleus scattering . for the case of exotic nuclei the corresponding charge densities",
    "are planned to be obtained by colliding electrons with these nuclei in storage rings . as shown in the nupecc report @xcite ,",
    "a first technical proposal for a low - energy electron - heavy - ion collider made at jinr ( dubna ) has been further developed and incorporated in the gsi physics program @xcite along with the plan for the electron - ion collider at the muses facility at riken @xcite .",
    "several interesting and challenging issues can be analyzed by the mentioned electron scattering experiments .",
    "one of them is to study how the charge distribution evolves with increasing neutron number ( or isospin ) at fixed proton number .",
    "the question remains up to what extent the neutron halo or skin may trigger sizable changes of the charge root - mean - square ( rms ) radius , as well as of the diffuseness in the peripherical region of the charge distribution .",
    "this point may then be very important for understanding the neutron - proton interaction in the nuclear medium .",
    "to this end the preliminary theoretical calculations of the charge form factors of neutron - rich exotic nuclei can serve as a challenge for future experimental works and thus , for accurate determination of the charge distributions in these nuclei . this can be a test of the different theoretical models used for predicting charge distributions .    in recent years theoretical work has been done along these lines focusing on halo nuclei ( e.g. @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "the borromean nuclei are described as three - body systems and the electron - ion scattering is considered in terms of a folding of a three - body density functional assuming separate interactions of electrons with the core and the halo nucleons .",
    "the three - body density functional is obtained from faddeev calculations that employ neutron - neutron and neutron - core forces able to describe the results from collisions with heavy ions . in @xcite various existing theoretical predictions for the charge distributions in light exotic nuclei @xmath0he , @xmath1li , @xmath2be ,",

    "the data were simulated for the @xmath51sn@xmath53 elastic scattering at a luminosity of 10@xmath54 @xmath55s@xmath56 .",
    "this model estimation shows that at low - momentum transfers ( @xmath57 @xmath25 ) the charge form factor of @xmath51sn can be precisely measured . however , in the range of moderate- and high - momentum transfer , where the charge form factor is dominated by the details of the charge density distribution , the expected error band becomes appreciable .",
    "hence , covering a wider region of @xmath39 makes possible to determine the charge distribution but requires higher luminosities .",
    "there is a qualitative agreement of model - dependent calculations of charge form factors for sn nucleus in @xcite with our results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) .",
    "another way to extract the charge distributions is to use a model - independent analysis based upon the expansion of the charge density on a complete set of orthogonal functions .",

    "the results of the present work can be summarized as follows :    in this work we extended the studies of the previous one @xcite of the proton , neutron , charge and matter densities and related charge form factors from the light neutron - rich exotic nuclei @xmath0he , @xmath1li to examples of unstable medium ( ni ) and heavy ( kr and sn ) isotopes in comparison with those of stable isotopes in the same isotopic chain . for he and li isotopes we use the proton and neutron densities obtained from realistic microscopic calculations within the large - scale shell - model method @xcite .",
    "the densities of ni , kr and sn isotopes are calculated in hf+bcs method with a density - dependent effective interaction using a large harmonic - oscillator basis @xcite .",
    "we also compare proton and matter density distributions for he and li isotopes .",
    "the calculated matter distributions for the halo nuclei are much more extended than the proton ones .",
    "we compare proton density distributions for the isotopes of he , li , ni , kr and sn and establish the differences of the proton densities in a given isotopic chain due to the presence of the neutron excess .",
    "there is a decrease of the proton density in the nuclear interior and an increase of its tail at large @xmath9 with increasing neutron number .",
    "a comparison of the proton , neutron , charge and matter rms radii as well as the corresponding diffuseness is performed for all isotopic chains considered .",
    "we point out that the general trend of the difference @xmath84 between the matter and proton rms radii is to increase with the number of neutrons but for the heavy isotopes this increase is moderate compared to that of the light ones .",
    "the calculated matter densities for @xmath29he and @xmath1li are in fair agreement with the experimental data obtained in proton scattering on these isotopes in gsi @xcite .",
    "we compare the matter rms radii with those from @xcite as well as with those from total interaction cross section data @xcite and their re - analysis @xcite .",
    "we calculate the charge form factors of he , li , ni , kr and sn isotopes by means of the densities mentioned above .",
    "the charge form factors are calculated not only in the pwba as in our previous work @xcite but also in the dwba , solving the dirac equation for electron scattering in the coulomb potential of the charge distribution in a given nucleus . by accounting for the coulomb distortion of the electron waves",
    "the born zeroes are filled and the form factors are shifted to smaller values of @xmath39 which is clearly seen in the cases of the ni , kr and sn isotopes where @xmath31 is large enough .",
    "we find that this shift is best parametrized by @xmath85 $ ] , where @xmath65 are the charge rms radii as given in the tables .",
    "in addition we also take into account the charge distribution in the neutron itself .",
    "we find that the contributions from the neutrons to the charge form factors are less than 20 % up to @xmath86 2 @xmath25 .",
    "the differences between the charge form factors in a given isotopic chain are shown .",
    "the common feature of the charge form factors is the shift of the form factor curves and their minima to smaller values of @xmath39 with the increase of the neutron number in a given isotopic chain.this is due to the corresponding enhancement of the proton tails in the peripherical region of the nuclei .",
    "the performed theoretical analyses of the densities and charge form factors can be a step in the studies of the influence of the increasing neutron number on the proton and charge distributions in a given isotopic chain .",
    "this is important for understanding the neutron - proton interaction in the nuclear medium .",
    "we emphasize also the questions of interest , namely , the necessary both kinematical regions of the proposed experiments and precision to measure small shifts in the form factors .",
    "the theoretical predictions for the charge form factors of exotic nuclei are a challenge for their measurements in the future experiments in gsi and riken and thus , for obtaining detailed information on the charge distributions of such nuclei",
    ". the comparison of the calculated charge form factors with the future data will be a test of the corresponding theoretical models used for studies of the exotic nuclei structure .",
