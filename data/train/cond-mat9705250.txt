    "the phenomena of weak localization ( wl ) and mesoscopic fluctuations in disordered systems have been intensively studied during the last fifteen years , mainly in connection with transport properties of these systems @xcite . for these phenomena",
    "the role of the electron - electron interaction is just in setting the length scale @xmath0 ( phase breaking length ) , below which the electron wave function preserves its phase coherence .",
    "systems with a size @xmath1 less than @xmath0 are called mesoscopic systems .    in this paper",
    ", we consider quantum corrections and mesoscopic fluctuations of the two other characteristics of a mesoscopic system , where the electron - electron interaction is essential : polarizability and capacitance .",
    "the former quantity can be measured by putting a sample into a capacitor , while the latter one determines the charging energy which shows up in the coulomb blockade experiments @xcite .",
    "the first quantum calculation of the polarizability of a small metallic particle was obtained in a seminal paper by gorkov and eliashberg ( ge ) @xcite .",
    "it relied on the following two assumptions concerning statistical properties of energy levels and eigenfunctions in disordered systems :    1 .",
    "the single - particle energy spectrum exhibits the same statistics as the eigenvalue spectrum of random matrices from the gaussian ensemble of the corresponding symmetry ; 2 .",
    "exact single - particle eigenfunctions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are close enough in energy , are correlated in the following way :    @xmath4    here the average is defined as @xmath5 @xmath6 is the sample volume , and the diffusion propagator @xmath7 is a solution to the diffusion equation , @xmath8,\\ ] ] with the boundary conditions @xmath9 .",
    "the first of these conjectures was proven by efetov @xcite , and the second by the authors @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it was shown in @xcite that for the energy difference much less than the thouless energy , @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a short - range function ( @xmath13 being the retarded green s function ) explicitly given by @xmath14 the short - range part @xmath15 of the correlation function ( [ func1 ] ) was not taken into account by gorkov and eliashberg , but it would give only a small correction to their result @xcite .    based on these conjectures , ge concluded that the polarizability for very low frequencies",
    "@xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the mean single - particle level spacing ; @xmath18 is the density of states per spin ) is enhanced in comparison with the classical value @xmath19 , the enhancement factor being of order @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the inverse screening radius .",
    "although the original paper @xcite gave a new insight into the field ( called later mesoscopic physics ) , and had a substantial impact on the further development of the condensed matter physics , this result for the polarizability is incorrect for the following reason .",
    "the paper by gorkov and eliashberg does not take into account the effects of screening : they calculate the polarizability in response to the local field rather than to the external one @xcite .",
    "as was found in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the screening restores the classical value of the polarizability , thus reducing the quantum effects to a relatively small correction .",
    "evaluation of this correction was recently attempted by efetov @xcite , who combined the non - perturbative calculation of the polarization function @xcite with the electron - electron interactions taken into account in the rpa approximation .",
    "since the value of the quantum correction depends on the presence ( or absence ) of the time reversal symmetry , it was denoted by efetov as a `` weak localization correction to polarizability '' ; we are following this terminology in the present article .",
    "however , he estimated incorrectly the contribution of the short - range term in eq.([func1 ] ) , which made him to conclude that the weak localization correction is dominated by this term . as we show below , this is not the case if the system size exceeds considerably the mean free path .",
    "more recently , noat , reulet , and bouchiat @xcite presented a perturbative calculation of the weak localization correction to the polarizability in a particular geometry of a narrow 2d ring .",
    "they considered both canonical ( ce ) and grand - canonical ( gce ) ensembles , and concluded that the correction to the polarizability is parametrically suppressed in the ce .",
    "while essentially confirming their gce result , we disagree with the above statement concerning the ce .",
    "we show below that the effect in the ce is of the same ( up to a coefficient of order one ) magnitude than the gce one , but has an opposite sign .",
    "as was realized by berkovits and altshuler @xcite , fluctuations in the polarization function lead to mesoscopic fluctuations of the polarizability of the sample .",
    "they considered a specific thin film geometry and identified the four - diffuson diagrams giving the leading contribution to the fluctuations .",
    "we will follow their approach when studying the polarizability fluctuations in 2d and 3d geometries .",
    "along with the polarizability , we consider another quantity characterizing a mesoscopic system , the capacitance @xmath22 .",
    "it determines the charging energy @xmath23 , which manifests itself in the @xmath24 characteristics of a quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "in particular , the charging energy represents the main contribution to the threshold voltage in the excitation spectra and to the distance between adjacent conductance peaks in the addition spectra .",
    "statistical properties of the coulomb blockade @xmath24 characteristics are attracting a great research interest now @xcite , which motivated us to consider the wl correction and the mesoscopic fluctuations of the charging energy .",
    "in addition , the capacitance determines the low - frequency behavior of the impedance of mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , the purpose of the present paper is to study _ systematically _ the wl effects and mesoscopic fluctuations of the polarizability and capacitance in 2d and 3d geometry .",
    "where it is necessary , we refine results of previous research .",
    "we show that the polarizability and the capacitance can be treated on the same physical grounds .",
    "we will also find a simple relation between the magnitude of the wl correction and that of the mesoscopic fluctuations .",
    "the electron - electron interaction is taken into account in the rpa approximation , which works for @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the fermi momentum .",
    "we consider the case of low temperature @xmath27 ( thus setting @xmath28 in all formulas ) , and study both grand - canonical and canonical ensembles .",
    "we consider an isolated disordered metallic particle @xmath29 ( 3d or 2d ) placed into a uniform external frequency - dependent electric field @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that the system is diffusive , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath1 are a mean free path and a typical size of a particle , respectively . in the rpa approximation",
    "the potential distribution @xmath33 and the electron density @xmath34 in the particle obey the poisson equation ( @xmath35 being the electron charge ) , @xmath36 in combination with the equation @xmath37 in 2d we use the following convention throughout the paper : @xmath38 denotes the coordinates in plain , and @xmath39 the transverse coordinate .",
    "the laplacian @xmath40 is always a three - dimensional operator , @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 is the polarization function ( per spin ) , which can be readily expressed through the matsubara green s functions , @xmath43 or , in terms of the retarded and advanced green s functions @xmath44 , @xmath45   \\langle g^{r } ( \\bbox{r } , \\bbox{r ' } , \\epsilon + \\omega ) g^{a } ( \\bbox{r ' } , \\bbox{r } , \\epsilon ) \\rangle \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\equiv   \\pi^{rr}(\\bbox{r},\\bbox{r'},\\omega)+ \\pi^{aa}(\\bbox{r},\\bbox{r'},\\omega)+ \\pi^{ra}(\\bbox{r},\\bbox{r'},\\omega ) .",

    "note that the formulas ( [ polar2b ] ) , ( [ sw ] ) , ( [ polar3 ] ) are written for the case of the unitary ensemble ( broken time - reversal symmetry due to the presence of a strong enough magnetic field ) , which was considered in ref.@xcite .",

    "the experimentally measured magnetopolarizability @xmath127 , defined as @xmath128 is therefore positive , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider now a quasi - two - dimensional sample of a thickness @xmath129 and an area @xmath130 with the electric field directed transverse to the sample plane .",

    "the short - range contribution is the leading one .",
    "in particular , for @xmath135 we find @xmath136    as is seen from the above formulas , the relative magnitude of the weak localization correction is rather low for both 3d and quasi-2d ( with the field direction normal to the plane ) geometries , so that the experimental observation of the effect in these cases may be problematic .",
    "the effect is much more pronounced in the 2d case , which we consider below .",

    "in the in - plane electric field the ring becomes polarized with the one - dimensional ( i.e. integrated over the ring cross - section ) charge density @xmath148 and the classical polarizability given by @xmath149 calculating the quantum correction , we find again that for a diffusive ring @xmath140 , the contribution @xmath95 dominates and gives @xmath150 the relative magnitude of the correction is @xmath151 where @xmath152 is now the quasi - one - dimensional conductance @xmath153 .",
    "these results for the ring geometry are by and large in agreement with those found by nrb @xcite .",
    "actually , nrb express the polarizability in terms of the exact eigenfunctions of electrons , conceptually similarly to the original ge calculation , and then perform the impurity averaging using the semi - classical expression for the correlation of the exact single - particle eigenfunctions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this calculation yields correct results for the following reasons .",
    "first , the short - ranged terms in eq .",
    "( [ func ] ) , omitted in this calculation , turn out to be unimportant for the wl correction to the polarizability . then",
    ", the _ exact _ expression for the long - ranged ( diffusive ) part of the eigenfunction correlator ( [ func ] ) coincides with the semi - classical result even for @xmath16 , where the latter generally is not expected to be true .",
    "this has been proved and discussed previously by the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "similarly , we can consider a quasi - one - dimensional strip of width @xmath154 and length @xmath155 oriented along the electric field direction ( which we choose to be the @xmath39-axis ) .",
    "again , the sample polarization is described by the one - dimensional charge density @xmath156 yielding the classical polarizability @xmath157 the quantum correction is now equal to @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the dimensionless conductance .",
    "we obtain @xmath160    thus , we have found that the wl correction to the polarizability can be quite appreciable in 2d ( circle ) and especially in quasi-1d ( ring or strip ) geometries , which gives a possibility of its experimental observation .",
    "these conclusions are in full agreement with those of nrb , ref.@xcite .",
    "the results obtained above were derived for the grand canonical ensemble , where the chemical potential is fixed by an external reservoir . in the appendix",
    "a we present the calculations for the canonical ensemble , which is more appropriate for the problem in question @xcite .",
    "we show ( eq . ( [ cebas ] ) ) that the ce magnetopolarizability differs from the gce result by the coefficient @xmath161 .",
    "this means that although the magnitude of the ce effect is the same as in the gce , the sign is opposite in the ce case : the magnetic field suppresses the polarizability .",
    "a natural definition of the capacitance in an open system is @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the total charge of the system .",
    "this capacitance determining the low - frequency transport properties of the system was studied thoroughly by bttiker and coworkers in refs .",
    "@xcite ( where it was called `` electrochemical capacitance '' ) .",
    "an explicit calculation @xcite yields @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the geometrical capacitance , determined from the equations of the classical electrostatics @xcite with corrections due to the screening effects , and @xmath166 is the density of states at the fermi level . the average of the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",

    "the quantity ( [ def4 ] ) has an important physical meaning : it is equal to the spacing between two consecutive peaks in the addition spectrum of a quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime . statistical properties of these spacings were studied experimentally in refs.@xcite and theoretically in ref.@xcite .",
    "similarly to the case of an open system ( eq.([dif3 ] ) ) , the peak spacing ( [ def4 ] ) can be decomposed into two parts : level spacing @xmath170 and ( usually much larger ) contribution associated with coulomb interaction ( denoted @xmath171 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the main contribution to the latter ( and thus to the coulomb blockade peak spacing ) is given by the charging energy @xmath172 defined @xcite as a constant part of the effective two - particle interaction potential @xmath173 of the electrons in the sample : @xmath174 in particular , the wl correction to the charging energy calculated below is the dominating term for the wl in the coulomb blockade peak spacing , and can be , in principle , measured as the magnetic field dependence of the peak spacing .",

    "in this paper , we have calculated the weak localization ( wl ) correction to the polarizability and the capacitance of a disordered sample and the mesoscopic fluctuations of these quantities .",

    "as our results show , an experimental observation of the magnetopolarizability of mesoscopic samples requires an experimental setup with large number of such samples , which would reduce the fluctuations .",
    "mesoscopic fluctuations of the charging energy contribute to the fluctuations of the conductance peak spacings in the addition spectra of quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime @xcite .",
    "however , as follows from eqs.([cap3 ] ) , ( [ fl3c ] ) , the magnitude of these fluctuations is much smaller ( by a factor @xmath226 ) than the level spacing @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the charging energy fluctuations to the fluctuations of the peak spacings is parametrically smaller than the effect of electron level fluctuations , which is given by the random matrix theory and is of order of @xmath40 .",
    "the charging energy fluctuations represent one ( but not the only one ) of the contributions to the enhancement of the peak spacing fluctuations as compared to the random matrix theory .",
    "this problem was considered in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to mention once more that we assumed the screening length to be much larger than the wave length , or in other words , that @xmath227 , where @xmath228 . in the opposite case , @xmath229 ( but still below the wigner crystallization threshold )",
