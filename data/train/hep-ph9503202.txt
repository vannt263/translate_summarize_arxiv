    "the standard @xmath0 gauge theory of the electroweak interactions is in good agreement with all current experimental data . nonetheless , there is no evidence to show which mechanism is responsible for the breakdown of this symmetry to the @xmath1 of electromagnetism .",
    "it is usually assumed that electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is due to the vacuum expectation value of one or more fundamental scalars which are doublets of @xmath2 .",
    "this explanation is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons :    @xmath3 in all such theories there must be at least one physical degree of freedom remaining from the fundamental scalar doublet(s ) , the higgs boson .",
    "as yet , there is no direct evidence for the existence of such a state .",
    "@xmath3 these models do not give a dynamical explanation of electroweak symmetry breaking . instead",
    ", the potential must be adjusted to produce the desired result .",
    "@xmath3 when embedded in theories with additional dynamics at higher energy scales , these theories are technically unnatural @xcite .",
    "for example , in the context of grand unified theories ( guts ) radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass(es ) give contributions proportional to large ( gut - scale ) masses .",
    "the higgs mass must be `` fine tuned '' to be of order the weak scale .",
    "@xmath3 theories of fundamental scalars are thought to be `` trivial '' @xcite , _ i.e. _ it is not possible to construct an interacting theory of scalars ( in four dimensions ) which is valid to arbitrarily short distance scales .",
    "rather , a theory of scalars must be viewed as a low - energy effective theory .",
    "new physics must enter below the energy scale of the `` landau - pole '' of the scalar theory .",
    "this last consideration implies that , whether or not a higgs boson exists , there must be new physics beyond the standard one - higgs doublet model at some ( possibly exponentially high ) energy scale . in this sense ,",
    "theories with a weakly coupled higgs , including the ever - popular minimal supersymmetric standard model , simply allow one to postpone answering the question of what is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking ( and other related questions such as the origin of fermion masses ) up to very high energies .    in theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking , such as technicolor @xcite",
    ", ewsb is due to chiral symmetry breaking in an asymptotically - free , strongly - interacting , gauge theory with massless fermions . unlike theories with fundamental scalars , theories of dynamical ewsb are natural . like the qcd scale , @xmath4",
    ", the weak scale arises by dimensional transmutation and can be exponentially smaller than , say , the gut or planck scales .",
    "furthermore , non - abelian gauge theories may make sense as fundamental theories .    in the simplest technicolor theory one introduces a left - handed weak - doublet of `` technifermions '' , and the corresponding right - handed weak - singlets ; both transform as @xmath5 s of a strong @xmath6 technicolor gauge group .",
    "the global chiral symmetry respected by the strong technicolor interactions is @xmath7 .",
    "when the technicolor interactions become strong , the chiral symmetry is broken to the diagonal subgroup , @xmath8 , producing three nambu - goldstone bosons which become , via the higgs mechanism , the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 . because the left - handed and right - handed techni - fermions carry different electroweak quantum numbers , the electroweak interactions break down to electromagnetism .",
    "if the @xmath11-constant of the theory , the analog of @xmath12 in qcd , is chosen to be 246 gev , then the @xmath9 mass has its observed value .",
    "furthermore , since the symmetry structure of the theory is _ precisely _ the same as that of the standard one higgs - doublet model , the remaining @xmath8 `` custodial '' symmetry insures that @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the `` eaten '' nambu - goldstone bosons , such a theory will give rise to various resonances , the analogs of the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and possibly the @xmath16 , in qcd .",
    "the phenomenology of an @xmath17 model in general , and of resonances of this sort in particular , are discussed in ref .  .",
    "however , the symmetry breaking sector must also couple to the ordinary fermions , allowing them to acquire mass . in models of a strong electroweak symmetry breaking sector there must either be additional flavor - dependent gauge interactions @xcite , the so - called `` extended '' technicolor ( etc ) interactions , or yukawa couplings to scalars @xcite ( as in the standard model ) which communicate the breaking of the chiral symmetry of the technifermions to the ordinary fermions . the most popular type of strong ewsb model which attempts to explain the masses of all observed fermions contains an entire family of technifermions with standard model gauge couplings .",
    "such models are referred to as one - family models . while this is a reasonable starting point for model building , given the family structure of the observed fermions , a variety of other possibilities",
    "have been explored .",
    "models containing more than one doublet of technifermions have a global symmetry group larger than @xmath18 .",
    "therefore chiral symmetry breaking produces additional ( pseudo-)nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngbs ) , other than those required to provide the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the models typically possess a larger variety of resonances than the one - doublet model .",
    "the phenomenology of arbitrary color - neutral pngbs and resonances is similar to that discussed in ref .   or , in the case of color - neutral charged pngbs , to that of the extra scalars in `` two - higgs '' models .",
    "therefore , in this work , we will largely be concerned with the properties of colored resonances and pngbs .",
    "these models have a possibly unique signature : resonances associated with the _ electroweak _ symmetry breaking sector which are _ strongly produced_. hadron colliders will be especially important for searching for signatures of such colored particles associated with ewsb .",
    "in this section we survey models with a dynamical ewsb sector , and summarize some of the novel physics that may be necessary in a model consistent with present data .",
    "we do not consider any of the models discussed in this section to be a complete theory of ewsb  in fact most of these models are ruled out by one or more of the problems listed below .",
    "their main value lies in illustrating some of the possible physics which may appear in a complete dynamical theory of ewsb .",
    "models incorporating etc interactions ran into trouble with flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) @xcite in the early 1980 s .",
    "for example , models with flavor dependent etc gauge couplings generically produce four - fermion interactions like : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the cosine and sine of a model - dependent mixing angle ; and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the etc gauge boson mass and coupling respectively .",
    "the interaction in equation ( [ 4f ] ) contributes to the @xmath24 mass splitting , and in order that this contribution be smaller than the short - distance , standard model contribution , we must have ( taking the mixing angle to be equal to the cabibbo angle ) : @xmath25 on the other hand , the mass of an ordinary fermion is expected to be given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the technifermion field @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the tc dynamics is qcd - like , we can estimate the technifermion condensate by scaling from qcd @xcite : @xmath28 given that @xmath11 can not be larger , reduces the value of @xmath11 needed to generate the correct @xmath9 mass . ]",
    "than 246 gev , it is impossible to generate a large enough mass for the @xmath29 quark ( much less the @xmath30 quark ) using the above relations .",
    "two possible solutions to the conflict between large fermion masses and small fcncs were proposed in the mid and late 1980 s .",
    "the first solution was to make the tc gauge coupling run slower than in qcd ( this behavior was dubbed walking ) @xcite .",
    "this has the effect of making the technifermion condensate much larger than scaling from qcd suggests , so that for a fixed quark or lepton mass , the necessary mass scale for etc gauge bosons is increased , thus suppressing fcncs .",
    "the second solution was to build a glashow - illiopoulos - maiani ( gim ) @xcite symmetry into the etc theory ( this is sometimes called technigim ) @xcite .",
    "this mechanism allows for etc scales as low as 1 tev .",
    "a further problem is how to produce a large isospin splitting for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 quark masses without producing large isospin splitting in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 masses @xcite .",
    "isospin splitting in the gauge sector is described by the radiative correction parameter @xmath33 ( a.k.a .",
    "@xmath34 ) , which is tightly constrained by experimental data .    a completely different alternative for model building is to include a scalar that couples to both fermions and technifermions in the model @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage that it allows for a standard gim symmetry , and can produce acceptable isospin splitting .",
    "the scalar may be kept light by supersymmetry @xcite , or it may be a composite , formed by some strong ( fine - tuned ) four - fermion interaction , for example @xcite .",
    "the latter possibility arises in models with strong etc interactions @xcite , which can be a natural result of walking , since walking implies that the tc coupling remains large out to the scale where tc is embedded in etc .",
    "scalars or strong etc interactions are also helpful in producing large top quark masses .",
    "a further twist on the tc scenario goes under the rubric of multiscale models @xcite .",
    "the original idea was that technifermions in different representations of the tc gauge group should condense at different scales , thus producing more than one scale of ewsb .",
    "( higher dimension tc representations may be useful for producing walking couplings . )",
    "multiple ewsb scales can also be produced in other ways .",
    "for example in walking and/or strong etc models , the effects of qcd interactions can produce a large splitting between techniquarks and technileptons @xcite .",
    "an additional challenge for tc models was noticed more recently @xcite : models with qcd - like dynamics tend to produce large positive contributions to the electroweak radiative correction parameter @xmath35 which grow with the number of technicolors and the number of technidoublets , while experiments tend to prefer small values for @xmath35 .",
    "there are several possibilities for evading this problem .",
    "there may simply be very few technifermions which contribute to ewsb , so that the contribution to @xmath35 is small .",
    "alternatively , mechanisms can be invented which produce a negative contribution to @xmath35 : the technifermions may have exotic electroweak quantum numbers @xcite , or the tc dynamics can be sufficiently unlike qcd so as to invalidate the naive scaling - up of qcd phenomenology @xcite .",
    "both of these alternatives usually also rely on some form of isospin breaking .",
    "this makes multiscale models potentially very useful since the bulk of the isospin breaking necessary to produce a negative contribution to @xmath35 can occur in the lowest ewsb scale @xcite , whereas the @xmath33 parameter is sensitive to isospin breaking at the highest ewsb scale .",
    "the most recent problem for etc models arises from the measurement of the @xmath36 partial width at lep @xcite .",
    "the experiments find a partial width which is slightly larger than the standard model prediction , while almost all the etc models that have been constructed so far produce a correction which further reduces this width .",
    "the sign of the correction is a consequence of the almost universal assumption that @xmath2 commutes with the etc gauge group .",
    "the alternative , where @xmath2 is embedded in the etc gauge group , may be interesting , since this reverses the sign of the correction @xcite .",
