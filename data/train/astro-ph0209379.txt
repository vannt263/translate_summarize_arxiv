    "from a large number of observational evidence , the currently favoured cosmological model is flat , accelerated and composed of @xmath3 of matter ( barionic + dark ) and @xmath4 of a negative - pressure dark component , usually named dark energy or  quintessence \" .",
    "the nature of such an unclustered dark energy component , however , is not very well understood at present , giving rise to many theoretical speculations .",
    "certainly , the most extensively studied explanation for this dark energy problem is the vaccum energy density or cosmological constant ( @xmath2 ) although other interesting possibilities are also alive in the current literature .",
    "some examples are : a very light scalar field @xmath5 , whose effective potential @xmath6 leads to an accelerated phase at the late stages of the universe @xcite , a x - matter component @xcite , which is simply characterized by an equation of state @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and that includes , as a particular case , models with a cosmological constant ( @xmath2cdm ) , a vaccum decaying energy density or a time varying @xmath2-term whose the present value of the cosmological constant ( @xmath9 ) is a remnant of the primordial inflationary / deflationary stage @xcite , geometrical effects from extra dimensions @xcite or still an exotic fluid , the so - called chaplygin gas , whose equation of state is given by @xmath10 where @xmath1 is a positive constant @xcite .",
    "all the above mentioned candidates for quintessence have interesting features that make them at some level compatible with the recent obervational facts ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "although most of these scenarios have been extensively explored in the recent literature , in the case of a chaplygin gas - type dark energy , however , only few analysis have focused attention on its cosmological consequences . from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "an interesting connection between the chaplygin gas equation of state and string theory has been identified @xcite . as explained in @xcite , a chaplygin gas - type equation of state",
    "is associated with the parametrization invariant nambu - goto @xmath11-brane action in a @xmath12 spacetime . in the light - cone parametrization ,",
    "such an action reduces itself to the action of a newtonian fluid which obeys eq .",
    "( 1 ) so that the chaplygin gas corresponds effectively to a gas of @xmath11-branes in a @xmath12 spacetime .",
    "moreover , the chaplygin gas is the only gas known to admit supersymmetric generalization @xcite .    from the observational viewpoint , it has been argued that the chaplygin gas may unify the cold dark matter and the dark energy scenarios @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a belief is the general behaviour of the chaplygin gas equation of state : it can behave as cold dark matter at small scales and as a negative - pressure dark energy component at large scales",
    ". recently , fabris _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analysed a cold dark matter plus a chaplygin gas scenario in the light of type ia supernovae data ( sne ia ) . as a general result",
    ", they found a universe completely dominated by the chaplygin gas as the best fit model .",
    "more recently , avelino _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a larger sample of sne ia and the shape of the matter power spectrum to show that such data restrict the model to a behaviour that closely matches that of a @xmath2cdm models while bento _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the location of the cmb peaks imposes tight constraints on the free parameters of the model .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore some other observational consequences of a chaplygin gas dark energy .",
    "we mainly focus our attention on the constraints from statistical properties of gravitationally lensed quasars ( qsos ) on the eq .",
    "we also investigate other observational quantities like the deceleration parameter , the acceleration redshift and the expanding age of the the universe . to obtain such results we assume a flat model driven by non - relativistic matter plus a chaplygin gas dark energy component ( from now on cgcdm ) .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii the field equations and distance formulas are presented .",
    "we also derive the expression for the deceleration parameter and discuss the redshift at which the accelerated expansion begins .",
    "the predicted age of the universe in the context of cgcdm models is briefly discussed in sec .",
    "we then proceed to analyse the constraints from lensing statistics on these scenarios in in sec .",
    "we end the paper by summarizing the main results in the conclusion section .",
    "let us now consider the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) line element ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the curvature parameter of the spatial section , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath5 are dimensionless comoving coordinates , and @xmath19 is the scale factor .",
    "since the two components ( nonrelativistic matter and chaplygin gas ) are separately conserved , we use the energy conservation law together with eq .",
    "( 1 ) to find the following expression for the chaplygin gas density @xmath20 or , equivalently , @xmath21 where the subscript @xmath22 denotes present day quantities , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a quantity related with the sound speed for the chaplygin gas today . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ limb ] ) , the chaplygin gas interpolates between non - relativistic matter ( @xmath25 ) and negative - pressure dark component regimes ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the friedmann s equation for the kind of models we are considering is @xmath27^{\\frac{1}{2}}. % \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation , an overdot denotes derivative with respect to time , @xmath28 @xmath29 is the present day value of the hubble parameter , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , respectively , the matter and the chaplygin gas density parameters .",
    "the deceleration parameter , usually defined as @xmath32 , now takes the following form @xmath33}{\\omega_{\\rm{m } } + \\omega_{cg } } - 1.\\ ] ] as one may check , for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the above expressions reduce to the standard and @xmath2cdm models , respectively .",
    "0.1 in    figure 1 shows the behavior of the deceleration parameter as a function of redshift for selected values of @xmath30 and @xmath36 .",
    "the best fit @xmath2cdm case is also showed for the sake of comparison ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "note that the value of @xmath36 determines the acceleration redshift @xmath37 . at late times , a cgcdm model with @xmath38 and @xmath39 accelerates faster than a @xmath2cdm scenario with @xmath40 .",
    "in such a model the accelerated expansion begins at @xmath41 .",
    "for the best fit model found in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the universe is strongly accelerated today with the accelerated phase begining at @xmath44 whereas for @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath40 we find , respectively , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    0.1 in    from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 5 ) , it is straightforward to show that the comoving distance @xmath49 to a light source located at @xmath50 and @xmath51 and observed at @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be written as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a convenient integration variable and the dimensionless function @xmath56 is given by @xmath57^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to derive the constraints from lensing statistics in sec .",
    "iv we shall deal with the concept of angular diameter distance . for the class of models here investigated , the angular diameter distance , @xmath58 , between two objects , for example a lens at @xmath59 and a source ( galaxy ) at @xmath60 , reads @xmath61    in fig .",
    "2 we show the dimensionless angular diameter distance between an observer @xmath62 and the source @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) as a function of the source redshift ( @xmath60 ) for @xmath40 and selected values of @xmath36 . as physically expected , the larger the value of @xmath36 the larger the distance that is predicted between two redshifts .",
    "this result shows that , for the value of @xmath30 considered , the behaviour of this class of cgcdm models may be interpreted as an intermediary case between the @xmath2cdm ( @xmath35 ) and the einstein - de sitter ( @xmath34 ) scenarios .",
    "this particular feature of cgcdm models may be important for the lensing statistics analysis because , as is well known , the large distances predicted by @xmath2cdm models make the lensing constraints on the vaccum energy contribution very restrictive ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in this concern",
    ", we expect that the constraints from this particular test will be weaker for cgcdm scenarios than for their @xmath2cdm counterparts .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the behavior of cgcdm cosmology can be very different from that one present by @xmath2cdm scenarios and general quintessence cosmologies .",
    "for example , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the trajectories of the statefinder parameters @xcite in cgcdm scenarios differs considerably from the one presented by quintesence or @xmath2cdm models . as commented in @xcite , the statefinder diagnostic",
    "combined with future supernovae observations ( as , for example , the snap mission ) may be able to discriminate between cgcdm and general quintessence cosmologies .",
    "more recently , an analysis for the location of the cmb peaks showed that cgcdm models and @xmath2cdm have very different predictions for large values of the parameter @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the predicted age of the universe for the class of cgcdm models considered in this paper is given by @xmath65 as widely known , a lower bound for this quantity can be estimated in a variety of different ways .",
    "for instance , oswalt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , analyzing the cooling sequence of white dwarf stars found a lower age limit for the galactic disk of 9.5 gyr .",
    "later on , a value of 15.2 @xmath66 3.7 gyr was also determined using radioactive dating of thorium and europium abundances in stars @xcite . in this connection ,",
    "the recent age estimate of an extremely metal - poor star in the halo of our galaxy ( based on the detection of the 385.957 nm line of singly ionized @xmath67u ) indicated an age of 12.5 @xmath66 3 gyr @xcite .",
    "another important way of estimating a lower limit to the age of the universe is dating the oldest stars in globular clusters .",
    "such estimates , however , have oscillated considerably since the publication of the statistical parallax measures done by hipparcos .",
    "initially , some studies implied in a lower limit of 9.5 gyr at @xmath68 confidence level ( c.l . ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , subsequent studies @xcite using new statistical parallax measures and updating some stellar model parameters , found 13.2 gyr with a lower limit of 11 gyr at 95@xmath69 c.l .",
    ", as a corrected mean value for age estimates of globular clusters ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "such a value implies that the einstein - de sitter model is ruled out for @xmath70 , while the most recent measurements of @xmath71 point consistently to @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "these results are also in accordance with recent estimates based on rather different methods for which the ages of the oldest globular clusters in our galaxy fall on the interval 13.8 - 16.3 gyr @xcite .    0.1 in    by assuming @xmath73 gyr as a median value for the most recent age estimates of globular clusters and @xmath74 @xmath75 , in accordance with the final results of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "key project @xcite , we find @xmath76 , a value that is compatible with the estimates discussed above , as well as very close to some determinations based on sne ia data @xcite . in fig .",
    "3 we show the dimensionless age parameter @xmath77 as a function of @xmath30 for some selected values of @xmath36 .",
    "horizontal dashed lines indicate @xmath78 of the age parameter for the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 considered here . similarly to the discussion for the angular diameter distance , for a fixed value of @xmath30 the predicted age of the universe is larger for larger values of @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath81 , as sugested by dynamical estimates on scales up to about @xmath82 mpc @xcite , we find @xmath83 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in order to constrain the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath36 from lensing statistics we work with a sample of 867 ( @xmath84 ) high luminosity optical quasars which includes 5 lensed quasars .",
    "this sample consists of data from the following optical lens surveys : hst snapshot survey @xcite , crampton survey @xcite , yee survey @xcite , surdej survey @xcite , not survey @xcite and fks survey @xcite .    the differential probability @xmath85 of a beam having a lensing event in traversing @xmath86 is @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are , respectively , the angular diameter distances from the observer to the lens , from the observer to the source and between the lens and the source .",
    "we use the schechter luminosity function with the lens parameters for e / so galaxies taken from madgwick _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    0.1 in    the total optical depth is obtained by integrating @xmath85 along the line of sight from @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) to @xmath60 .",
    "one obtains @xmath100^{3}\\ , r_{o}^{3}. \\label{atau}\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "4 we show the normalized optical depth as a function of the source redshift ( @xmath60 ) for values of @xmath101 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.9 and 1.0 .",
    "two different cases are illustrated : a conventional cgcdm model with the matter density parameter fixed at @xmath40 and a chaplygin gas + baryonic matter model with @xmath102 . as discussed earlier ,",
    "the reason for considering the later case is because one of the strongest claims for a chaplygin gas dark energy is the possibility of a unified explanation for the dark matter and dark energy problems @xcite . in this case",
    ", one might expect that the only two components of the universe would be the chaplygin gas and the baryonic matter .",
    "note that in both cases an increase in @xmath36 at fixed @xmath30 tends to increase the optical depth for lensing .",
    "for example , for @xmath40 , the value of @xmath103 for @xmath104 at @xmath105 is down from the @xmath2cdm ( @xmath35 ) value by a factor of @xmath106 2.97 , while at the same redshift , @xmath103 for @xmath107 is down from that for @xmath108 by @xmath106 2.63 . by fixing the value of @xmath36 , for example , @xmath109",
    ", we observe that the value of @xmath103 is smaller for a universe with @xmath40 than for a universe composed only of the chaplygin gas + baryonic matter ( @xmath110 ) by a factor of @xmath106 1.18 .",
    "this increase of the optical depth as the value of @xmath36 is increased ( at a fixed @xmath60 and @xmath30 ) is an expected consequence since this model more closely approaching the @xmath2cdm case as @xmath111 .",
    "the likelihood function is defined by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the number of multiple - imaged lensed quasars , @xmath114 is the number of unlensed quasars , and @xmath115 and @xmath116 are , respectively , the probability of quasar @xmath117 to be lensed and the configuration probability .",
    "these quantities are defined by @xmath118 and @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121    the magnification bias , @xmath122 , is considered in order to take into account the increase in the apparent brightness of a quasar due to lensing which , in turn , increases the expected number of lenses in flux limited sample . the bias factor for a quasar at redshift @xmath123 with apparent magnitude @xmath124",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath125 where @xmath126 in the above equation @xmath127 is the measure of number of quasars with magnitudes in the interval @xmath128 at redshift @xmath123 .",
    "since we are modeling the lens by a singular isothermal model profile , @xmath129 , we adopt @xmath130 in the numerical computation .",
    "for the quasar luminosity function we use kochanek s `` best model '' @xcite @xmath131 where @xmath132 and we assume @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 at b magnitude @xcite .",
    "due to selection effects the survey can detect lenses with magnification larger than a certain magnitude @xmath136 given by equation ( [ mf ] ) which becomes the lower limit in equation ( [ bias1 ] ) . to obtain selection function corrected probabilities , we follow @xcite and divide our sample into two parts , namely , the ground based surveys and the hst survey .    0.1 in    from eq . ( [ llf ] )",
    "we find that the maximum value of the likelihood function is located at @xmath137 and @xmath108 . at the 1@xmath138 level , however , almost the entire range of @xmath36 is compatible with the observational data for values of @xmath139 . as observed earlier ( see sec .",
    "ii ) , this result suggests that a large class of cgcdm scenarios is in accordance with the current gravitational lensing data . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we also analyse some possible differences between our best - fit value and the one obtained for general quintessence scenarios with an equation of state @xmath140 ( xcdm ) @xcite . for example , for xcdm models a similar analysis shows that the maximum value of the likelihood function is located at @xmath141 and @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "such a model corresponds to a decelerated universe with a deceleration parameter @xmath143 and a total expanding age of @xmath144 gyr while our best - fit cgcdm model corresponds to an accelerating scenario with @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) and a total age of the order of @xmath147 gyr . in fig . 5a",
    "the expected number of lensed quasars , @xmath148 ( the summation is over a given quasar sample ) , is displayed as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "as indicated in the figure , the horizontal dashed line indicates @xmath149 , that is the number of lensed quasars in our sample . by this analysis",
    ", one finds @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) . in fig . 3b",
    "we show the contour for five lensed quasars in the parametric space @xmath152 .",
    "the shadowed horizontal region corresponds to the observed range @xmath153 @xcite . as a general result ,",
    "this analysis provides @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "we also observe that the higher the value of @xmath30 the higher the value of @xmath36 that is required to fit these data .",
    "the search for alternative cosmologies is presently in vogue and the leitmotiv is the observational support for an accelerated universe provided by the sne ia results . in general ,",
    "such alternative scenarios contain an unkown negative - pressure dark component that explains the sne ia results and reconciles the inflationary flatness prediction ( @xmath156 ) with the dynamical estimates of the quantity of matter in the universe ( @xmath157 ) . in this paper",
    "we have focused our attention on another dark energy candidate : the chaplygin gas .",
    "we showed that the predicted age of the universe in the context of cgcdm models is compatible with the most recent age estimates of globular clusters for values of @xmath158 and @xmath83 .",
    "we also studied the influence of such a component on the statistical properties of gravitational lensing . at @xmath159 level",
    "we found that a large class of these scenarios is in agreement with the current lensing data with the maximum of the likelihood function ( eq . [ llf ] ) located at @xmath137 and @xmath108 .",
    "as a general result , the predicted number of lensed quasars requires @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",

    "<S> a combination of recent observational results has given rise to what is currently known as the dark energy problem . </S>",
    "<S> although several possible candidates have been extensively discussed in the literature to date the nature of this dark energy component is not well understood at present . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate some cosmological implications of another dark energy candidate : an exotic fluid known as the chaplygin gas , which is characterized by an equation of state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a positive constant . by assuming a flat scenario driven by non - relativistic matter plus a chaplygin gas dark energy we study the influence of such a component on the statistical properties of gravitational lenses . a comparison between the predicted age of the universe and the latest age estimates of globular clusters </S>",
    "<S> is also included and the results briefly discussed . in general , we find that the behavior of this class of models may be interpreted as an intermediary case between the standard and @xmath2cdm scenarios . </S>"
