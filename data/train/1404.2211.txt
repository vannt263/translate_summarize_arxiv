    "a detailed survey of various old results about clifford parallel lines in the three - dimensional elliptic space ( over the real numbers ) can be found in the recent article @xcite .",
    "one such result is a description of clifford parallel lines in terms of the complexified elliptic space , and it may be summarised as follows : the elliptic metric yields a hyperbolic quadric of the complex projective space ; it is known as the ` absolute quadric ' .",
    "two lines of the elliptic space are clifford parallel if , and only if , there exists a line of the absolute quadric that meets both of them ( after complexification ) .",
    "since there are two reguli on the absolute quadric , one actually gets two parallelisms .",
    "it is conventional to label them as the ` left ' and ` right ' clifford parallelism of the elliptic space .",
    "an alternative approach uses the skew field @xmath4 of real quaternions as underlying vector space of the elliptic space .",
    "the norm function of @xmath4 is a quadratic form , and it yields the elliptic metric . the left and right clifford parallelism arise from the left and right multiplication in @xmath4 , respectively ; see @xcite .",
    "any quaternion skew field @xmath3 with arbitrary characteristic and centre @xmath2 , say , can be used ( as in the classical case ) to define a left and a right clifford parallelism in the three - dimensional projective space on the @xmath2-vector space @xmath3 .",
    "this finding from @xcite was the starting point for the research in @xcite and @xcite , where the following was established : if the ground field @xmath2 is extended in an appropriate way , then the description from above of clifford parallel lines in terms of the two reguli on a hyperbolic quadric basically remains valid .",
    "however , the details are much more involved for an arbitrary quaternion skew field @xmath3 than for the real quaternions @xmath4 .    according to @xcite ,",
    "there is one more kind of clifford parallelism in three - dimensional projective spaces over certain fields @xmath2 of characteristic two .",
    "the algebraic definition of such a parallelism is similar to what we had in the preceding paragraphs , but now one has to use a field extension @xmath0 with degree @xmath1=4 $ ] and such that @xmath5 for all @xmath6 .",
    "so @xmath0 is purely inseparable . due to the commutativity of @xmath3 ,",
    "left parallel lines now are the same as right parallel lines .",
    "there arises the question if also in this remaining case there is a geometric description of clifford parallel lines similar to the one from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we shall have to take several steps before we can provide an affirmative answer .",
    "first , we extend the ground field of the projective space ( with underlying vector space @xmath3 ) from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "next , we find in this extended space a distinguished plane @xmath7 which will be called the _ absolute plane_. its points are determined by the singular vectors of a quasilinear quadratic form .",
    "so the points of the absolute plane correspond , loosely speaking , to the points of the hyperbolic quadric from above .",
    "however , we must not use all lines of this plane to accomplish our task , but only those passing through a particular _ absolute point _",
    "@xmath8 of @xmath7 .",
    "this gives a single _ absolute pencil of lines _ which now takes the part of the two reguli on a hyperbolic quadric .",
    "finally , our main result is theorem  [ thm : clifford ] : two lines of the three - dimensional projective space over @xmath2 are clifford parallel if , and only if , there exists a line of the absolute pencil that meets both of them ( after extension of the ground field ) .    for more information about parallelisms in general",
    ", we refer to @xcite , @xcite , the book @xcite , and the references therein . at one point",
    "we shall come across the double space axiom , which is part of the well established axiomatic description of clifford parallelisms ; see , among others , @xcite , the survey in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "notions from geometry and algebra that are used without further reference can be found , for example , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 be a vector space over a field @xmath2 .",
    "we shall also write @xmath10 instead of @xmath9 in order to clarify the ground field .",
    "if @xmath2 is a subfield of a field @xmath3 then @xmath9 can be extended to a vector space over @xmath3 by the following well known construction @xcite : the tensor product @xmath11 can be made into a vector space over @xmath3 by letting @xmath12 we use the shorthand @xmath13 for this @xmath3-vector space .",
    "the canonical embedding of @xmath10 in @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath9 is also an associative @xmath2-algebra with unit @xmath16 .",
    "a multiplication in @xmath17 can be defined by the formula @xmath18 in this way @xmath14 turns into an associative algebra over @xmath3 with unit @xmath19 , and the embedding from above is a monomorphism @xcite .    from now on let @xmath2 be a field of characteristic @xmath20 and let @xmath3 be an extension field of @xmath2 with degree @xmath1=4 $ ] and such that @xmath5 for all @xmath21 .",
    "the field extension @xmath0 is purely inseparable . clearly , each @xmath22 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial @xmath23 $ ] , whence @xmath3 is a _",
    "quadratic _ or , in a different terminology , a _",
    "_ algebra over @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the quadratic form @xmath24 has no singular vectors .",
    "it is the _ norm form _ of the algebra @xmath25 .",

    "quadratic form .",
    "this means that is a semilinear mapping of the vector space @xmath25 in the vector space @xmath2 over its subfield @xmath26 formed by all squares , with @xmath27 as accompanying field isomorphism ; see also @xcite .",
    "we now specialise the algebra @xmath10 from above to be @xmath25 and obtain the four - dimensional commutative and associative @xmath3-algebra @xmath28 with unit @xmath29 . according to , scalars from @xmath3 act on the _ first _ factors of pure tensors .",
    "so , the scalar multiples of @xmath29 comprise the one - dimensional subspace @xmath30 of @xmath31 .",
    "this subspace is a first isomorphic copy of the field @xmath3 within the algebra @xmath31 .",
    "a second copy is given by the subset @xmath32 .",
    "here the elements of @xmath3 appear in their role as vectors of @xmath25 .",
    "none of these isomorphic copies of @xmath3 will be identified with @xmath3 .",
    "the multiplication in the field @xmath3 is an @xmath3-bilinear mapping @xmath33 . clearly , this mapping is also @xmath2-bilinear . by the universal property of the tensor product ( for vector spaces over @xmath2 )",
    "there is a unique @xmath2-linear mapping @xmath34 using and , a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath35 actually is a surjective homomorphism of unital @xmath3-algebras .",
    "since @xmath3 is a field , this implies already that @xmath36 is a three - dimensional maximal ideal of the four - dimensional algebra @xmath31 , but we easily can say more .",
    "[ lem : local ] the l - algebra @xmath31 is local and quadratic .",
    "the ideal of non - invertible elements of @xmath31 is the kernel @xmath7 of the homomorphism @xmath37 from .",
    "any @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "we read off from @xmath41 that @xmath42 is a zero of the polynomial @xmath43\\subset l[x]$ ] , whence @xmath31 is quadratic . for @xmath44",
    "we obtain @xmath45 , whereas any @xmath46 clearly has no multiplicative inverse due to @xmath47 .",
    "thus the ideal @xmath7 comprises precisely the non - invertible elements of @xmath31 .",
    "so , by definition , @xmath31 is a local algebra , and @xmath7 has the required property .    the canonically defined @xmath3-linear form @xmath37 maps @xmath48 for all @xmath49 . due to @xmath50 , the form @xmath37 does not arise as an extension of an @xmath2-linear form on @xmath25 . however , the _ square of @xmath37 _ ,",
    "i.e. , the _ norm form _ @xmath51 is a quasilinear quadratic form extending the quasilinear quadratic form from @xmath25 to @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , the norm of @xmath52 equals @xmath53 for all @xmath49 .",
    "the non - zero vectors of @xmath7 are precisely the singular vectors of the norm form .",
    "let us return to multiplication .",
    "any @xmath54 determines the mapping @xmath55 i.e. , the multiplication of elements of @xmath3 by the fixed element @xmath56 .",
    "any such @xmath57 clearly is an @xmath3-linear mapping @xmath58 , but below we shall only make use of its @xmath2-linearity . likewise , for any @xmath59 there is an @xmath3-linear mapping @xmath60 .",
    "the canonical extension of @xmath61 from @xmath25 to @xmath31 is the _ kronecker product _ ( or : _ tensor product _",
    "@xcite ) @xmath62 which acts on pure tensors by sending @xmath63 so @xmath64 .",
    "note that , contrary to what we had in , the element @xmath54 acts on the _ second _ factors of pure tensors in .    at times",

    "when working in @xmath31 it will often be more appropriate to change from the basis to another basis of @xmath31 , namely @xmath73 for example , if @xmath74 has coordinates @xmath75 with respect to the basis then @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the norm of @xmath42 .    while the elements @xmath78 depend on the choice of @xmath79 in the basis ,",
