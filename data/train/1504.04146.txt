    "the envelope theory ( et ) , also known as the auxiliary field method , is a procedure to obtain approximate solutions of @xmath0-body hamiltonians in quantum mechanics @xcite . in the most favorable cases ,",
    "an approximate eigenvalue is an analytical lower or upper bound .",
    "the method relies on the replacement of the hamiltonian @xmath2 under study by an auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath3 which is solvable , the eigenvalues of @xmath3 being optimized to be as close as possible to those of @xmath2 .",
    "recently , the accuracy of the et for eigenvalues and eigenvectors has been tested by computing the ground state of various systems containing up to 8 bosons @xcite .",
    "this comparison was possible thanks to accurate numerical results published in @xcite and obtained by using explicitly correlated gaussian basis @xcite .",
    "in several cases , it has been shown that the approximate eigenvalues computed with the et can be improved by modifying the structure of the characteristic global quantum number of the method @xcite .",
    "the price to pay is generally the loss of the variational character of the approximation . in @xcite , a modification of the global quantum number",
    "is proposed and tested by introducing only one supplementary parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure relies on the result obtained in @xcite , where a universal effective quantum number for centrally symmetric 2-body systems is proposed .",
    "the new parameter @xmath4 can be determined by a fit on analytical results for @xmath5 or on accurate numerical results @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a method to compute the value of @xmath4 , independently of the knowledge of analytical or numerical previous calculations .",
    "the idea is to compare the eigenvalues computed with the et to the corresponding ones computed with a @xmath0-body generalization of the dominantly orbital state ( dos ) method . in this last method ,",
    "an approximate solutions is found by quantizing the radial motion around a semiclassical solution for a circular motion .",
    "developed at the origin for 2-body systems @xcite , it has been extended to 3-body systems @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the et method is briefly recalled in sec .",
    "[ sec : et ] .",
    "the extension of the dos method for @xmath0-body systems is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : dos ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phi ] , the computation of the parameter @xmath4 is described .",
    "the relevance of this parameter is tested with various systems in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] .",
    "since the behavior of observables is not really predictable when @xmath4 is varied @xcite , we do not consider eigenvectors here .",
    "some concluding remarks are finally given .",
    "we consider the following general hamiltonian , in a @xmath1 dimensional space ( @xmath6 ) , for @xmath0 identical particles @xmath7 @xmath8 is a kinetic energy , @xmath9 a one - body interaction and @xmath10 a two - body potential ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the center of mass motion is removed ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 is the center of mass position . it is shown in @xcite that , in the framework of the et , an approximate eigenvalue @xmath14 is given by the following set of equations for a completely ( anti)symmetrized state : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the number of particle pairs , and @xmath18 is a global quantum number .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath19 identical harmonic oscillators , implying a strong degeneracy .",
    "following the forms of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the approximate value @xmath14 can have a variational character @xcite .",
    "the method is easy to implement since it reduces to find the solution of a transcendental equation",
    ". equations  ( [ afm1n]-[afm3n ] ) have a nice semiclassical interpretation @xcite , but the et yields true quantum results : approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors . in this paper , we focus on the eigenvalues .",
    "information about the corresponding eigenvectors can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us simply mention the following results giving a clear interpretation of the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite : @xmath22",
    "in the dos method for 2-body systems , an approximate solution is found by quantizing the radial motion around a semiclassical solution for a circular motion @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "this method has been extended to 3-body systems , but it is mentioned that a generalization to @xmath0-body seems difficult . nevertheless , this appears finally possible starting from ( [ afm1n]-[afm3n ] ) , since a semiclassical interpretation of the et is established in terms of circular motions of @xmath0 particles in a fully symmetrical configuration @xcite .",
    "let us consider a pure circular motion for the @xmath0 particles with the energy @xmath23 .",
    "we can rewrite ( [ afm2n ] ) as @xmath24 @xcite , where the total angular momentum @xmath25 will be specified later .",
    "but , it is expected that @xmath26 in order to justify the semiclassical approximation .",
    "@xmath23 can be computed from the system  ( [ afm1n]-[afm3n ] ) with @xmath27 replaced by @xmath25 .",
    "now , let us determine a solution with energy @xmath28 for a small collective radial perturbation around this circular solution . following a similar procedure",
    "as the one developed in @xcite , we build from ( [ afm1n ] ) a hamiltonian @xmath29 ruling this radial motion by the replacements , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are conjugate variables . assuming that @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ", a power expansion of @xmath29 , limited to the lowest non - vanishing orders , gives @xmath35 with @xmath36 the terms in @xmath32 are cancelled by ( [ afm3n ] ) .",
    "the perturbed energy @xmath37 is then simply given by @xmath38 it is expected that @xmath39 in order that @xmath40 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath41 with @xmath21 being a solution of the system  ( [ afm1n]-[afm3n ] ) where @xmath27 is replaced by @xmath25",
    ". to produce relevant results , quantum numbers @xmath25 and @xmath42 must be specified .",
    "this work is done for @xmath43 in @xcite .",
    "the general case is discussed in the following section .",
    "let us recall that the results given by this method are expected to be relevant for completely ( anti)symmetrized states @xcite , provided @xmath39 and @xmath26 .",
    "in @xcite , it is shown that an effective quantum number @xmath44 that determines with high accuracy the level ordering of centrally symmetric 2-body systems has the following form ( for practical purposes , our definition of @xmath4 differs from the one used in @xcite ) @xmath45 where the number @xmath4 depends on the system .",
    "this structure comes from the separation of angular and radial motions .",
    "the dos method relies on a similar separation for @xmath5 and 3 @xcite . for @xmath0-body systems ,",
    "we can try @xmath46 this is the case in @xcite with @xmath43 , where the quantum numbers @xmath47 and @xmath48 are used due to a particular scaling of the conjugate variables .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , that the energies obtained by the et can be significantly improved by replacing the quantum number @xmath27 in the system  ( [ afm1n]-[afm3n ] ) by the new quantum number @xmath49 which partly breaks the strong degeneracy of @xmath27 .",
    "this is an obvious generalization of ( [ nqnum ] ) , but for @xmath19 degrees of freedom .",
    "such an extension from 2 to @xmath0 particles is expected to be relevant because of the existence , in the framework of the et , of relations linking the energy of a @xmath0-body system to the energy of the corresponding 2-body system by a rescaling of the global quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "the genuine et , with its possible variational solutions , is then recovered with @xmath50 . for other values of @xmath4 ,",
    "the variational character of the solution can not be guaranteed .",
    "if the parameter @xmath4 is assumed constant , it can be determined by a fit on a single known accurate solution .",
    "this procedure is used in @xcite for some specific systems .",
    "it should be preferable to have procedure allowing the computation of @xmath4 without the prior knowledge on some solutions of the system .",
    "this is possible by combining the information coming from the et and the dos method .",
    "let us write @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath53 , the solution @xmath23 of the system  ( [ afm1n]-[afm3n ] ) is the unperturbed solution of the dos method .",
    "we can now search for a solution when @xmath54 , by setting @xmath55 an expansion to the non - vanishing lowest orders of ( [ afm3n ] ) yields a relation between @xmath56 and @xmath32 . using this link in an expansion to the non - vanishing lowest orders of ( [ afm1n ] )",
    "finally gives @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59   \\left [ u'\\left(\\frac{r_0}{n}\\right ) + \\sqrt{c_n}\\ , v'\\left(\\frac{r_0}{\\sqrt{c_n}}\\right ) \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\lambda\\,t'\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{r_0}\\right )   \\left [ u''\\left(\\frac{r_0}{n}\\right ) + n\\ , v''\\left(\\frac{r_0}{\\sqrt{c_n}}\\right ) \\right ] , \\\\ \\label{b3 } b_d & = & \\frac{n\\ , \\lambda}{r_0 ^ 2 } \\,t'\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{r_0}\\right )   + \\frac{n\\ , \\lambda^2}{r_0 ^ 3 } \\,t''\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{r_0}\\right ) + u'\\left(\\frac{r_0}{n}\\right ) + \\frac{r_0}{n}\\,u''\\left(\\frac{r_0}{n}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sqrt{c_n}\\ , v'\\left(\\frac{r_0}{\\sqrt{c_n}}\\right ) + r_0\\ , v''\\left(\\frac{r_0}{\\sqrt{c_n}}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( [ deltaea ] ) and ( [ deltaeb ] ) correspond to the same expansion @xmath39 .",
    "so we can write @xmath60 the complete expression for @xmath4 is quite complicated .",
    "but , the computation of @xmath4 is straightforward once @xmath21 is determined . in some cases , the final expression can be very simple , as shown with the examples below .",
    "the procedure to compute a numerical solution is the following :    1 .   fix the global quantum numbers @xmath42 and @xmath25 ; 2 .",

    ", we can hope that some relevant information about the relative influence of radial and orbital motions are now captured in the et .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath4 is determined in a particular limit : @xmath39 and @xmath26 .",

    "this will be tested in the next section .",
    "in this section , we consider various systems of @xmath0 identical particles with the same mass @xmath67 , for which analytical et solutions can be found .",
    "the et formalism developed is valid for bosons or fermions with any values of @xmath1 , but comparisons with numerical results will only be performed for boson - like particles in the @xmath68 space , as in @xcite .      in the first example , nonrelativistic particles interact via a 2-body power - law potential @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the et gives the following upper ( lower ) bound for the energy @xmath14 if @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) @xmath74 the computation of @xmath4 gives a remarkably simple result @xmath75 when @xmath76 , the exact result @xmath50 is recovered .",

    "the situation is less favorable , since @xmath90 while @xmath91 .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement between the two approaches can be considered as quite good , since @xmath4 is computed with the assumption that @xmath92 , not @xmath93 .",
