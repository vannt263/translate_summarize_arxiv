    "this will help clarify some unresolved issues such as the genus characterization ( which at the moment is indistinguishable from effect of interaction both of which are contained in @xmath0 ) .",
    "the matrix model of rna with logarithmic interaction provides a larger class of interacting rna structures than the matrix model of @xcite .",
    "this is because an additional ( and therefore complete ) dependence of the structures on @xmath8 ( other than vertices and edges ) in the model will be possible in terms of all the @xmath8 punctures of the riemann surfaces .",
