    "the solar atmosphere is designed by beautiful magnetic structures e.g. , loops , arcades , filaments , jets , spicules , etc .",
    "the evolution in the observational instruments and satellites has made the observation of these magnetic structures more and more possible over the years @xcite .",
    "but the concept that is of our interest is the oscillations guided by these magnetic structures . due to the transverse",
    "structuring in the solar atmosphere caused by these plasma eruptions , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves are bound to propagate along them @xcite . in the present study",
    "the magnetic structures under consideration are the spicules .",
    "spicules are one of the most observed phenomena in the solar atmosphere especially in the chromosphere . although spicules look very similar to coronal jets , but they are usually smaller , cooler , and denser .",
    "the chromospheric spicules observed at the solar limb are reported to have speeds around @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 propagating out towards the solar corona @xcite .",
    "the diameter of spicules ranges from @xmath5  km to @xmath6  km , and their lengths ranges from @xmath7  km to @xmath8  km .",
    "the typical lifetime of spicules is between @xmath9 and @xmath10 minutes , with densities between @xmath11 and @xmath12 m@xmath13 .",
    "their temperatures are estimated between @xmath7 and @xmath14 k @xcite . in the context of the present study , it is the wave dynamics in spicules which is to be taken under consideration .",
    "spicules experience transverse oscillations which have already been observed by both , spectroscopic and imaging devices .",
    "ground based coronagraphs @xcite together with soho proved adequate for the detection of doppler shift oscillations in spicules @xcite . with the enhancement of observational devices ( hinode / sot ) periodic displacements of the spicule axis became more and more pronounced , where some where interpreted as kink @xcite and some as alfvnic waves @xcite .",
    "however , the statistical study carried out by @xcite using hinode / sot showed that @xmath15 percent of the waves guided by spicules propagate upward , @xmath16 of the waves propagate downward , and @xmath17 of the waves are standing oscillations .",
    "in the present study the mhd wave under consideration is the torsional alfvn wave . out of all the mhd waves",
    "@xcite , only the torsional alfvn wave is completely incompressible @xcite .",
    "however @xcite showed that in the presence of an equilibrium magnetic twist , the torsional wave becomes compressible .",
    "observation wise , there is still vague indirect evidence of the detection of torsional alfvn waves in the solar chromosphere and corona .",
    "this is due to lack of spatial resolution in solar observations .",
    "however , @xcite studied the non - thermal broadening of the green line in a coronal loop and came to the conclusion that they are standing torsional waves . in the photosphere - chromosphere region , @xcite reported the periodic variations of the spectral line widths as detection of torsional waves .",
    "+ one of the features of coronal seismology is the period ratio , @xmath0 , of the waves , where @xmath18 represents its fundamental period and @xmath19 represents its first harmonic . in this line",
    "@xcite analyzed the time series of oxygen line profiles obtained from sumer / soho on the solar south limb spicules .",
    "they calculated the doppler shifts and consequently doppler velocities in the coronal hole region .",
    "their wavelet analysis determined periods of the fundamental mode and first harmonic .",
    "the calculated period ratios showed departures from the canonical value of @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for this deviation could be due to two issues .",
    "one is density stratification @xcite , the other is magnetic twist @xcite . in other words ,",
    "@xcite analyzed active region observations based on trace instrument and detected two periods with high confidence and calculated @xmath0 as @xmath20 . nonetheless , @xcite studied the competitive effects of density stratification and magnetic field expansion on torsional alfvn waves in solar spicules .",
    "they showed that under some circumstances this ratio can approach its observational value even though it departs from its canonical value of @xmath2 .    in the present study , in addition to the density stratification and magnetic field expansion of the cylindrical structure which resembles a solar spicule , a steady flow parallel to the vertical magnetic field",
    "is also taken in to account .",
    "prior to this work the effects of steady flows where studied in cylindrical structures by @xcite where it was shown how the steady flow makes the frequencies undergo a doppler shift as well as shifting the cut - off frequencies .",
    "the consequence of this could be reflected in the period ratios of the oscillations in the wave guiding structure @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the observational data obtained from hinode / sot and performed time slice diagrams shedding more light on the spicule oscillations . in the present study the mhd waves in the presence of steady flow inside solar spicule",
    "is studied .",
    "the model is discussed in the next section .",
    "consider an expanding untwisted magnetic flux tube with varying density along its axis . if a steady flow along the axis of this tube is present , a solar spicule is resembled .",
    "it is now clear that the geometry implemented will be cylindrical with coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "note that the cylinder axis is aligned with the @xmath22-axis and the equilibrium magnetic field components are @xmath23 and @xmath24 with no azimuthal field , @xmath25 .",
    "the equilibrium magnetic field , @xmath26 , could be written in terms of the vector potential ( @xmath27 ) as @xmath28 where we have @xmath29 note that @xmath30 is taken constant along the field lines .",
    "since the aim here is to study standing torsional alfvn waves , we consider one node on the foot point of the spicule at @xmath31 and the other node on the extent of the spicule at @xmath32 .",
    "note that @xmath33 is the spicule length .",
    "the dynamics of such oscillations are well described by the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "if the steady flow inside the spicule is parallel to the spicule axis and represented by @xmath34 , we have    @xmath35    and @xmath36 where the plasma displacement is @xmath37 , and the magnetic field perturbation is @xmath38 . by considering the perturbations proportional to @xmath39 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : velo ] ) and  ( [ eq : mag ] ) would become    @xmath40    and @xmath41 in the long - wavelength limit where , @xmath42 , the radius of expanding spicule is much smaller than the spicule length @xmath43 , eqs .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : full ] ) is a generalization of the analysis presented by @xcite .    in the context of coronal seismology , it would be more realistic to use the background magnetic field , plasma density , and spicule radius inferred from the actual magnetoseismology of observation @xcite    @xmath50    the third expressio of equation  [ eq : equlib ] is due to the conservation of the magnetic flux , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the magnetic and density scale heights , respectively . substituting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : equlib ] ) in equation  ( [ eq : full ] ) gives    @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in equation ( [ eq : pde ] )",
    "the lengths are normalized by the spicule length ( @xmath33 ) , and the frequencies by the alfvn frequency ( @xmath56 rad / s ) .",
    "the other parameters are as ; @xmath57 km / s ; @xmath58 g , @xmath59 kg m@xmath13 , @xmath60 t m a@xmath4 , and @xmath61 km ) .",
    "the magnetic and density scale heights have been determined by @xcite as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the numerical study carried out here is based on the differential transform method ( dtm @xcite ) .",
    "this method is applied to equation  ( [ eq : pde ] ) which gives the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of standing torsional alfvn waves in stratified and expanding solar spicules , see @xcite for detailed description of this method .",
    "we use the rigid boundary conditions and assume that @xmath64 . in the top panel of figure  [ fig1 ] the fundamental frequency @xmath65 of the torsional alfvn wave is plotted with respect to the parameter @xmath66 for various mach numbers .",
    "this has been repeated for the second harmonic and shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it could be readily noticed by comparing the corresponding curves of the top and middle panels of figure  [ fig1 ] that their ratios are away from number @xmath2 .",

    "are very moderate .",
    "both the effects of stratification as well as the tube expansion are quite strong .",
    "however they act in the opposite directions . while the stratification results in the reduction of the ratio @xmath0 , the tube expansion leads to the increase of this ratio . as a result",
    ", the two effects almost cancel each other .",
    "we can observe that they exactly cancel each other when @xmath68 .",
    "it could be noticed that slower steady flows create higher frequencies and consequently lower periods with respect to those of static medium .",
    "an interesting result which is obtained by looking at the bottom panel of figure  [ fig1 ] is that the period ratio , @xmath0 , is very close to the observed values .",

    "it should be emphasized that steady flows have already been reported in observations carried out on spicules .",
    "eigenfunctions of the fundamental and first harmonic torsional alfvn modes with respect to the normalized height along the spicule are presented in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we plotted eigenfunctions for @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath71 which is determined by observations .     and",
