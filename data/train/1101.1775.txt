    "in many areas of engineering , numerical solution of problems by the finite element method ( fem ) leads to solution of systems of linear algebraic equations with sparse and often ill - conditioned matrices .",
    "for very large problems , the usual method of choice for their solution is one of the iterative methods based on krylov subspaces .",
    "however , without preconditioning , the convergence rate deteriorates with growing condition number of the problem .",
    "the need of first - rate preconditioners tailored to the solved problem , which can be implemented in parallel , gave rise to the field of domain decomposition methods ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the balancing domain decomposition based on constraints ( bddc ) is one of the most advanced preconditioners of this class .",
    "it was introduced by dohrmann @xcite in 2003 and the theory was developed by mandel and dohrmann in @xcite . in an important contribution to the theory of the preconditioner @xcite , mandel , dohrmann , and tezaur proved close connections with the earlier feti - dp method by farhat et al .",
    "@xcite , another popular domain decomposition technique .",
    "the preconditioner was reformulated without explicit coarse problem as is used in this paper by li and widlund in @xcite .",
    "the underlying theory of the bddc method covers problems with symmetric positive definite matrix .",
    "an important application that leads to such kind of systems is structural analysis by linear elasticity theory .",
    "the solution of the incompressible stokes problem by a mixed finite element method leads to a saddle point system with symmetric indefinite matrix .",
    "thus , the standard theory of bddc does not cover this important class of problems .",
    "in the first attempt to apply bddc to the incompressible stokes problem proposed by li and widlund  @xcite , the optimal preconditioning properties of bddc were recovered . the approach is based on the notion of _ benign subspaces _ , which is restricted to using discontinuous pressure approximation , and the authors present results for piecewise constant functions .",
    "moreover , the approach in @xcite requires quite nonstandard constraints between subdomains , thus making the implementation more problem specific and difficult .    in this paper , we follow a different approach .",
    "we have implemented a  parallel version of the bddc method and verified its performance on a number of problems arising from linear elasticity ( e.g. @xcite ) . here",
    ", we investigate the applicability of the method and its implementation to the stokes flow with only minor changes to the source code of the implementation for elasticity problems .",
    "although such application is beyond the standard theory of the bddc method , contributive results are obtained .",
    "it has been known for a long time , that the conjugate gradient method is able to reach solution also for many indefinite cases ( e.g. @xcite ) , although it may fail in general .",
    "our effort is also supported by recent trends of numerical linear algebra to investigate and often prefer the use of preconditioned cg method ( pcg ) with a suitable indefinite preconditioner over more robust but also more expensive iterative methods for solving indefinite systems such as minres , bicg or gmres @xcite .",
    "another reason for which we do not switch to the minres method @xcite , which is suitable for indefinite problems ( e.g. @xcite ) , is the fact that it requires a positive definite preconditioner , while bddc at the presented setting provides an indefinite preconditioner for the saddle - point problem .",
    "several results for the stokes flow in three dimensions are presented .",
    "all these problems are obtained using mixed discretization by taylor - hood finite elements or their serendipity version .",
    "these elements use piecewise ( tri)linear pressure approximation , which does not allow the approach via benign spaces of @xcite , but are very popular in the computational fluid dynamics community .",
    "let @xmath0 be an open bounded domain in @xmath1 filled with an incompressible viscous fluid , and let @xmath2 be its boundary .",
    "isothermal low speed flow of such fluid is modelled by the following stokes system of partial differential equations @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the vector of flow velocity , @xmath5 denotes the pressure divided by the ( constant ) density , @xmath6 denotes the kinematic viscosity of the fluid supposed to be constant , @xmath7 denotes the density of volume forces per mass unit , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two subsets of @xmath2 satisfying @xmath10 , @xmath11 denotes an outer normal vector to the boundary @xmath2 with unit length , and @xmath12 is a given function satisfying @xmath13 in the case of @xmath14 .",
    "we derive the weak formulation of the stokes equations ( [ ss])-([bcn ] ) in the manner of mixed methods ( cf .",
    "let us consider the vector function space @xmath15 ^ 3 ; { \\bf v}|_{\\partial\\omega _ g } = { \\bf 0 } \\big\\}$ ] and the set @xmath16",
    "^ 3;{\\bf v}|_{\\partial\\omega _ g } = { \\bf g } \\big\\}$ ] , where @xmath17 is the usual sobolev space , and the restriction @xmath18 is understood in the sense of traces .",
    "we now introduce a triangulation of the domain @xmath0 into taylor - hood finite elements @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 ( or their serendipity version @xmath21 ) , which satisfy the babuka - brezzi stability condition ( cf .",
    "their application leads to the finite dimensional subsets @xmath22 , @xmath23 , which contain continuous piecewise quadratic functions , and @xmath24 with continuous piecewise linear functions .",
    "we can now introduce the _ discrete stokes problem _ :    find @xmath25 and @xmath26 satisfying @xmath27 here @xmath28 represents the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath12 in ( [ bcd ] ) .    expressing the finite element functions as linear combinations of basis functions",

    "let @xmath0 be a  bounded domain in @xmath35 or @xmath36 , let @xmath37 be a  finite element space of piecewise polynomial functions @xmath38 continuous on @xmath39 and @xmath40 its dual space .",
    "let @xmath41 be a  bilinear form on @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and let @xmath44 denote the duality pairing of @xmath40 and @xmath37 .",
    "consider now an abstract variational problem : _ find @xmath45 such that _",

    "each subdomain is a  union of several finite elements of the underlying mesh with characteristic mesh size @xmath52 , i.e. nodes of the finite elements between subdomains coincide .",

    "the problem is first reduced to the interface @xmath53 . for this purpose ,",
    "the solution @xmath54 is split into the interior solution @xmath55 , with zero values at @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , where values in subdomain interiors are determined by values at @xmath56 ( see ( [ eq : discharm ] ) below )",

    "this results in the block form of the system ( [ eq : a - problem2 ] ) given as @xmath61{cc } a_{11 } & a_{12}\\\\ a_{21 } & a_{22 } \\end{array } \\right ]   \\left [ \\begin{array } [ c]{c } u_{\\gamma1}+u_{o1}\\\\ u_{\\gamma2}+u_{o2 } \\end{array } \\right ]   = \\left [ \\begin{array } [ c]{c } f_{1}\\\\ f_{2 } \\end{array } \\right ]   , \\label{eq : a - block}\\ ] ] with @xmath62 by definition .",
    "function @xmath57 is called _ discrete harmonic _ , by which we mean that it is fully determined by values at interface @xmath56 and by the algebraic condition @xmath63 by this splitting , we derive that ( [ eq : a - block ] ) is equivalent to @xmath64 @xmath61{cc } a_{11 } & a_{12}\\\\ a_{21 } & a_{22 } \\end{array } \\right ]   \\left [ \\begin{array } [ c]{c } u_{\\gamma1}\\\\ u_{\\gamma2 } \\end{array } \\right ]   = \\left [ \\begin{array } [ c]{c } 0\\\\ f_{2}-a_{21}u_{o1 } \\end{array } \\right ]   , \\label{eq : a - block - interface2}\\ ] ] and the solution is obtained as @xmath65 .",

    "note , that the schur complement @xmath68 is never formed explicitly and its action is realized by three sparse matrix multiplications and one back - substitution .",
    "the main reason for using algorithm [ alg : substructuring ] is usually much faster convergence of the iterative method for problem ( [ eq : s - problem ] ) compared to problem ( [ eq : a - problem ] ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "<S> a parallel implementation of the balancing domain decomposition by constraints ( bddc ) method is described . </S>",
