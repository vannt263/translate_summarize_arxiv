    "the global economy is a prototypic example of complex self - organizing system , whose collective properties emerge spontaneously through many local interactions . in particular , international trade between countries defines a complex network which arises as the combination of many independent choices of firms .",
    "it was shown that the topology of the world trade network ( wtn ) strongly depends on the gross domestic product ( gdp ) of world countries @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the gdp depends on international trade by definition @xcite , which implies that the wtn is a remarkably well documented example of adaptive network , where dynamics and topology coevolve in a continuous feedback . in general",
    ", understanding self - organizing networks is a major challenge for science , as only few models of such networks are analytically solvable @xcite .",
    "however , in the particular case of the wtn , the binary topology of the network is found to be extremely well reproduced by a null model which incorporates the degree sequence @xcite .",
    "these results , which have been obtained using a fast network randomization method that we have recently proposed @xcite , make the wtn particularly interesting . in this paper , after briefly reviewing our randomization method , we apply it to study the occurrence of triadic ` motifs ' , i.e. directed patterns involving three vertices ( see fig.[mot_img ] ) .",
    "we show that , unlike other properties which have been studied elsewhere @xcite , the occurrence of motifs is not explained by only the in- and out - degrees of vertices .",
    "however , if also the numbers of reciprocal links of each vertex ( the _ reciprocal degree sequence _ ) are taken into account , the occurrences of triadic motifs are almost completely reproduced .",
    "this implies that , if local information is enhanced in order to take into account the reciprocity structure , motifs display no significant deviations from random expectations . therefore the ( in principle complicated ) self - organization process underlying the evolution of the wtn turns out to be relatively simply encoded into the local dyadic structure , which separately specifies the number of reciprocated and non - reciprocated links per vertex .",
    "thus the dyadic structure appears to carry a large amount of information about the system .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize our recently proposed randomization method and how it can be used to detect patterns when local constraints are considered .",
    "our method , which is based on the maximum - likelihood estimation of maximum - entropy models of graphs , introduces a family of null models of a real network and uses it to detect topological patterns analytically @xcite . defining a null model means setting up a method to assign probabilites @xcite . in our approach , a real network @xmath0 with @xmath1 vertices",
    "is given ( either a binary or a weighted graph , and either directed or undirected , whose generic entry is @xmath2 ) and a way to generate a family @xmath3 of randomized variants of @xmath0 is provided , by assigning each graph @xmath4 a probability @xmath5 . in the method ,",
    "the probabilities @xmath5 are such that a maximally random ensemble of networks is generated , under the constraint that , on average , a set @xmath6 of desired topological properties is set equal to the values @xmath7 observed in the real network @xmath8 .",
    "this is achieved as the result of a constrained shannon - gibbs entropy maximization @xcite              where the linear combination of the contraints @xmath12 is called _ graph hamiltonian _",
    "( the coefficients @xmath13 are free parameters , acting as lagrange multipliers controlling the expected values @xmath14 ) and the denominator @xmath15 is called _",
    "partition function_.    the next step is the maximization of the probability @xmath16 to obtain the observed graph @xmath17 , i.e. the real - world network to randomize @xcite .",
    "this step fixes the values of the lagrange multipliers as they are found by maximizing the log - likelihood          that is , that the ensemble average of each constraint , @xmath21 , equals the observed value on the real network , @xmath22 .",
    "once the numerical values of the lagrange multipliers are found , they can be used to find the ensemble average @xmath23 of any topological property @xmath24 of interest @xcite :      the exact computation of the expected values can be very difficult .",
    "for this reason it is often necessary to rest on the _ linear approximation method _ @xcite .",
    "however , in the present study we will consider particular topological properties @xmath24 ( i.e. motif counts , see below ) whose expected value can be evaluated _",
    "exactly_. our method also allows to obtain the variance of @xmath24 by applying the usual definition :    @xmath26=\\langle[x(\\mathbf{g})-\\langle x\\rangle)]^2\\rangle=\\sum_{i , j}\\sum_{t , s}\\sigma[g_{ij},g_{ts}]\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial g_{ij}}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial g_{ts}}\\right)_{\\mathbf{g}=\\langle\\mathbf{g}\\rangle } \\label{eq_generalpropagation}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 $ ] is the covariance of the adjacency matrix elements @xmath2 and @xmath28 .",
    "this formula can be greatly simplified by considering probabilities that are factorizable in terms of dyadic probabilities , as follows      where the product runs over all the dyads , that is the unordered pairs of vertices @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 is the joint probability that @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "finally , the variance of @xmath24 evaluated in @xmath19 becomes    @xmath35)^2=\\sum_{i , j}\\left[\\left(\\sigma^*[g_{ij}]\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial g_{ij}}\\right)_{\\mathbf{g}=\\langle\\mathbf{g}\\rangle^*}^2+\\sigma^*[g_{ij},g_{ji}]\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial g_{ij}}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial g_{ji}}\\right)_{\\mathbf{g}=\\langle\\mathbf{g}\\rangle^*}\\right]\\enspace .\\ ] ]    the joint knowledge of @xmath23 and @xmath36 $ ] allows to detect deviations from randomness in the observed topology .",
    "in particular , as we show later , it is possible to calculate by how many standard deviations the observed value @xmath37 differs from the expected value @xmath23 .",
    "quantities which are consistent with their expected value are explained by the enforced constraints @xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , significantly deviating properies can not be traced back to the constraints and therefore signal the incompleteness of the information encoded in the constraints .",
    "other approaches achieve this result by explicitly generating many randomized variants of the real network , measuring @xmath24 on each such variant , and finally computing the sample average and standard deviation of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this is extremely time consuming , especially for complicated topological properties .",
    "by contrast , our method is entirely analytical .",
    "it yields any expected quantity @xmath23 in a time as short as that required in order to measure @xmath37 on the single network @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "if the network is a binary graph ( i.e. if each graph @xmath38 in the ensemble is uniquely specified by its adjacency matrix @xmath39 ) , then the simplest ( i.e. local ) choice of the constraints is the _ degree sequence _ ,",
    "i.e. the vector of degrees ( numbers of incident links ) of all vertices . for directed networks , which are our interest here",
    ", there are actually two degree sequences : the observed in - degree sequence @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 ) and the observed out - degree sequence @xmath42 ( with @xmath43 ) .",
    "this null model , which is known as the _ directed configuration model _",
    "( dcm ) , can be completely dealt with analytically using our method ( see appendix ) . when applied to the wtn",
    ", the dcm shows that many topological properties ( such as the degree - degree correlations and the directed clustering coefficients ) are in complete accordance with the expectations @xcite .",
    "this shows that the degree sequences @xmath44 and @xmath45 are extremely informative , as their ( partial ) knowledge allows to reconstruct many aspects of the ( complete ) topology . on the other hand",
    ", it was also shown that the _ reciprocity _ of the wtn is highly non - trivial @xcite .",
    "this means that the occurrence of reciprocal links is much higher than expected under any model which , as the dcm , treats two reciprocal links ( e.g. @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) as statistically independent .",
    "a direct consequence is that the reciprocity , as well as any higher - order directional pattern , should not be reproduced by the dcm .",
    "these seemingly conflicting results can only be reconciled if , for some reason , the topological properties that have been studied under the dcm @xcite mask the effects of reciprocity . in particular , the directed clustering coefficients , which are based on ratios of realized triangles over the maximum number for each vertex , may show no overall deviation from the dcm , even if the numerator and denominator separately deviate from it . in",
    "what follows , we investigate this possibility by considering all the observed subgraphs of three vertices ( which include both open and closed triangles ) separately .",
    "also , we will use an additional null model which also takes the number of reciprocal links of each vertex into account .",
    "this second null model is the _ reciprocal configuration model _ ( rcm ) @xcite .",
    "the local constraints defining it are the three , observed directed - degree sequences @xmath48 , with @xmath49 ( non - reciprocated out degree ) , @xmath50 , with @xmath51 ( non - reciprocated in - degree ) and @xmath52 , with @xmath53 ( reciprocated degree ) to be imposed across the ensemble of networks having the same number of vertices of the observed configuration and , on average , the above - mentioned directed - degree sequences . in the appendix",
    "we describe both the dcm and the rcm in more detail , and derive their expectations explicitly .      in the following analyses ,",
    "we use yearly bilateral data on exports and imports from the gleditsch database to analyse the six years 1950 , 1960 , 1970 , 1980 , 1990 , 2000 .",
    "this database contains aggregated trade data between countries , i.e. data as they result by summing the single commodity - specific trade exchanges .",
    "so we end up with six different , real , asymmetric matrices with entries @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "these adjacency matrix elements are the fundamental data allowing us to obtain all the possible representations of the wtn : to build the binary , directed representation we are interested in here , we restrict ourselves to consider two different vertices as linked , whenever the corresponding element @xmath54 is strictly positive .",
    "this implies that the adjacency matrix of the binary , directed representation of the wtn in year @xmath56 is simply obtained by applying the heaviside step function to the database entries , i.e. @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "triadic motifs , i.e. all the possibile directed patterns connecting three vertices , are the natural generalizations of directed clustering coefficients @xcite and the starting point for the understanding of a complex network s self - organization in communities .",
    "thirteen , non - isomorphic , triadic directed patterns can be indentified and classified @xcite . given a real , binary , directed matrix @xmath58 , the motifs occurrences @xmath59 can be written in at least two different ways ( see table [ motable ] ) .",
    "the first one prescribes to define them in terms of the adjacency matrix entries , @xmath60 .",
    "the second one allows to compactly express the coefficients @xmath59 by introducing the following dyadic variables      thus making the role of reciprocity explicit .",
    "however , the number of occurrences of the particular motif @xmath62 ( where @xmath62 ranges from 1 to 13 ) as measured on the observed network @xmath63 is uninformative unless a comparison with a properly defined null model is made ( see appendix ) .",
    "this implies that the occurrence of a motif should be compared with its expected value @xmath64 , as computed under the chosen null model .",
    "this can be compactly achieved by introducing the so - called @xmath65-score      measuring by how many standard deviations , @xmath67 $ ] , the observed and the expected occurrences of motif @xmath62 differ .",
    "large absolute values of @xmath68 $ ] indicate motifs that are either over- or under - represented under the particular null model considered and therefore not explained by the constraints defining it , as shown in fig.[motcm ] and fig.[motrcm ] and discussed in the next section ."
