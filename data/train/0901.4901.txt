    "the technique of interferometric aperture synthesis has brought about a revolution in the field of radio astronomy in the past four decades@xcite .",
    "the technique works by synthesizing images from signals obtained from antennas spread over a large distance . for a quick introduction to basic interferometric radio astronomy",
    ", please see the appendix a.    most radio telescopes today use the concept of interferometric aperture synthesis . the very large array ( vla ) in the usa with 27 antennas and the giant meter wave radio telescope ( gmrt ) in india with 30 antennas are good examples of such telescopes . a multi - purpose new generation radio telescope",
    "called the _ square kilometer array _ ( ska ) has been proposed ( see section [ sec : prev_wrk ] and the website http://www.skatelescope.org ) , and is currently in the design phase .",
    "an important problem in the field of interferometric radio - astronomy is to find the antenna placement on the ground that generates a required uv - distribution .. ] this problem is a computationally difficult one  @xcite .",
    "in addition to antenna placement on purely scientific merit , other dimensions are added when we consider logistical and financial issues .",
    "for example , given a particular placement , what is the optimum cable layout ? what trade - off can be struck between scientific merit and wire length and other infrastructure costs ?    in this paper",
    "we look at three important problems that arise chiefly from the standpoint of astronomic merit :    * the first is a general problem .",
    "it turns out that a gaussian distribution of uv points in the radial direction and a uniform distribution in the azimuthal direction is desirable for gaussian beams  @xcite .",
    "it has been observed empirically that a uniform random placement of antennas on the xy plane yields a radially tapering uv distribution  @xcite .",
    "a simple calculation shows that this is as expected .",
    "however , it may not be sufficiently close , particularly when some antenna positions are not feasible ( say , because of geopolitical constraints ) .",
    "how does one rectify this ?",
    "* the second is motivated primarily by financial considerations .",
    "suppose the funding for the project is spread over a period of time as is likely to be in the case of the ska .",
    "it is also reasonable to assume that the construction of the entire array will take time , because of logistical reasons .",
    "in such a scenario , one would still like to perform experiments and get good quality images in the meantime .",
    "can we come up with a placement schedule that enables such a graceful upgrading ? + this question has been raised in the past in this context  @xcite and others  @xcite . a more recent version of this question concerns expanding existing arrays  @xcite .",
    "their solution involves evaluating every antenna configuration .",
    "this is expensive in the scenario where the number of antennas is large , and there is limited time for rearrangement of antennas between successive experiments . * the third concerns mobile antennas . while there are a limited number @xmath0 of antennas available , there are several more pads that can host an antenna each",
    "ideally , an experiment would require antennas on at least some of those pads .",
    "consider the case when only some @xmath1 of those antennas are available ( due to maintenance reasons or involvement with other experiments , the rest are unavailable ) . on which @xmath1 pads out of the required pads should we place the antennas ?",
    "we propose a minimum variance method ( mvm ) that tackles the above problems .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same framework is useful for these seemingly different problems .",
    "informally , this technique involves choosing @xmath1 out of @xmath0 ( where @xmath2 ) possible locations for placing the antennas . to achieve this , we start by placing an antenna on each of the m locations . then",
    ", we iteratively remove @xmath3 antennas , one at a time , such that we stay  close \" to the target uv distribution .",
    "our solution takes @xmath4 time , which is an improvement over brute force solutions",
    ". a brute force solution would involve comparing distributions that result from all @xmath5 choices for antenna removal .",
    "we conduct our experiments on a random placement scheme , on the placement data of 120 antennas / stations of the proposed australian ska ( see next section ) , and on the placement data of the 24 antennas of the sub - millimeter array at mauna kea , hawaii ( see section [ sec : app ] ) .",
    "some relevant literature is discussed in the next section . in section [ sec : mvm ] , we present the minimum variance method . section [ sec : app ] shows how the technique applies to the three problems stated above , along with the experimental results .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "this work has been done keeping in mind the proposed square kilometre array ( ska ) project .",
    "the ska is an ambitious multi - purpose new generation radio telescope with a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometer , designed to work over a wide range of radio frequencies ",
    "@xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the telescope is expected to play a major role in answering key questions in modern astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "this high resolution array will be @xmath8 times more sensitive , and will be able to cover the sky @xmath9 times faster than any imaging radio telescope array previously built .",
    "it is hoped that besides exploratory astronomy , the ska will provide insights into many interesting questions about the birth and evolution of galaxies , origins of magnetism , possibility of existence of life on some other planet , verification of general relativity etc . for more details",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "a lot of work has been done in the past on the problem of antenna placement .",
    "they range from constructing the array ab - initio to incrementing an existing one .",
    "we cite a few important example papers here ; the reader is encouraged to read the citations therein .    in 1989 , treloar compared various array configurations in terms of the amount of sampling of different regions in the uv - plane and the absence of holes therein , for fixed declinations  @xcite . among the configurations studied was the spiral , with higher concentration towards the centre with distribution of antennas varying with the radius .",
    "cohanim et al posed the array design problem as a multi - objective optimization problem of maximizing image performance and minimizing cable - length using genetic algorithms and simulated annealing  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the work of takeuchi et al  @xcite , they mention the problem of phased deployment of the antennas .",
    "lonsdale and cappallo make the case for a large number of antennas , of the order of a thousand  @xcite . among other factors including high fidelity and good uv - coverage , they argue that a large number of stations ( a collection of antenna imaging a specific region of the sky ) relieves the dependence on the earth s rotation for a comprehensive sampling of the uv - plane .",
    "they also present log - spiral and hybrid ( log - spiral for inner regions and pseudo - random star for the outer regions ) antenna layouts , which have the advantages of good uv - coverage towards the centre , a wide range of baseline lengths and shorter communication cables in general",
    ". problems of insufficient coverage and long cable lengths appear in the outer regions .",
    "several variants of a technique that seeks to maximize the distance between uv points have also been explored in the past ( @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "karastergiou et al  @xcite adapted the approach of boone  @xcite and cornwell  @xcite to the case when there are more potential sites ( called pads ) than antennas , and one has to choose a configuration for an experiment by shifting the antennas among the pads .",
    "the work stemmed from an observation of boone  @xcite that if the density of the uv - plane is sparse , it is advisable to spread the gaussian along a radial direction a bit so that all regions of the uv - plane have at least a sample point .",
    "the technique they used was inspired by the physical phenomenon of charges spreading on a closed 2-d surface in order to minimize the energy .",
    "their idea is to affect all the discrete shifts and see which configuration results in the least energy , thus satisfying the experimental requirements .",
    "su et al  @xcite proposed the uniform weight approach .",
    "the problem that they tackle is of choosing sites for placement of antennas given several more candidate sites .",
    "they aim for a uniform and complete uv - distribution in the absence of a - priori information on the objectives of the experiments .",
    "their method involves assigning a weight to a uv point that is equal to its distance from the nearest uv point .",
    "an antenna is thus assigned the sum of all distances of the relevant uv points .",
    "the antenna that has the least weight is dropped .    finally , we mention the tomographic projection method of de villiers  @xcite in which he compares the projection of an imperfect and an ideal uv distributions onto one dimension .",
    "the discrepancy yields correction terms that are mapped to new antenna positions .",
    "doing this in several directions allows one to get close to the ideal configuration .",
    "the basic idea of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we divide the uv - plane into @xmath10 regions .",
    "division is necessary because we wish a distributed removal of points so that some portion of the uv plane is not denuded of uv points .",
    "the general way to capture the notion of distribution is to grid the plane and then talk of  points per grid unit \"  @xcite .",
    "how this division is done will be described towards the end of this section .",
    "we note , however , that the mvm can accommodate any scheme for division of the uv plane in principle .",
    "the desired uv distribution dictates the number of uv points each region should hold .",
    "our algorithm starts with @xmath11 antennas and removes @xmath12 antennas , one at a time , in an iterative fashion .",
    "suppose that at the start of the @xmath13 iteration , there are @xmath14}$ ] regions and @xmath15}$ ] antennas .",
    "then , @xmath15}-1 $ ] uv points will be dropped as a result of the removal of one antenna during the @xmath13 iteration .",
    "depending on the requirements of the uv distribution , we would like the removal of @xmath16}$ ] uv points from the @xmath17 region in the @xmath13 iteration .",
    "however , in general , the number of uv points dropped from the region @xmath18 due to removal of antenna @xmath19 would be different , say @xmath20 .",
    "we capture the discrepancy between the actual and ideal uv points dropped in every region by removing the antenna @xmath19 with the following term : @xmath21 } } ( w_{i}(j)-r_{i}^{[r]})^2.\\ ] ] we now drop the antenna that has the least @xmath22 value . in short ,",
    "the logic for deletion of the @xmath1 antennas is this :    1 .   _ while there are more than @xmath1 antennas remaining do _ 2 .",
    "_ for each remaining antenna @xmath19 _ 3 .",
    "calculate @xmath23 .",
    "end for _ 5 .",
    "remove the antenna that has the least @xmath22 .",
    "_ end while _",
    "this antenna removal routine can be tweaked for different problems .",
    "let us now estimate the worst case time complexity of this routine .",
    "there are at most @xmath3 antennas to be removed .",
    "every remaining antenna is a candidate for removal , of which there are at most @xmath0 . for every such candidate we go through the ( at most @xmath24 ) uv points ,",
    "identify those associated with the candidate , and determine which region they belong to , in order to calculate @xmath23 .",
    "thus , we need at most @xmath25 steps .    but for a rotation for changing coordinates ,",
    "a uv point is defined as @xmath26 and @xmath27 for every pair @xmath28 and @xmath29 of xy coordinates ( see appendix a ) .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to work with the distribution that the xy coordinate differences may follow . in all our experiments , without loss of generality , we take @xmath30",
    ".    there are at least two natural choices for the shape of the regions into which the uv plane can be divided .",
    "one is into concentric circles due to radial symmetry .",
    "the other is into coaxial ellipses because of the facts that the uv tracks are elliptical in general , and that in several earth rotation aperture synthesis telescopes , a prolonged coverage is desirable . in a scheme that removes antennas progressively from a large set , there are two options regarding the number of regions .",
    "the first is to adaptively reduce the number of regions in accordance with the reduced antennas . in doing so",
    ", the configuration in an iteration will mimic that in the previous iteration .",
    "the second option is to stick to the same number of regions throughout , so that all intermediate configurations will mimic the final .",
    "we demonstrate the use of different uv plane division schemes , both in terms and shape and number of regions , in our experiments .",
    "the uv distribution that is desired in most cases is a gaussian along the radial and uniform along the azimuthal direction .",
    "as the next lemma indicates , a random distribution of antennas on the ground , that is , the xy - plane , gives a tapering distribution in the uv - plane .",
    "lemma :    consider a @xmath31 square grid having @xmath32 lattice points in the xy plane .",
    "suppose that we choose each lattice point independently with probability @xmath33 and look at the uv distribution generated by the chosen points .",
    "then the expected number of uv points at the position @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , is @xmath36 .",
    "proof :    for the given @xmath31 square grid , the number of pairs of lattice points @xmath28 and @xmath37 such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 is @xmath40 .",
    "since each such contributing pair is expected to be chosen with probability @xmath41 , linearity of expectation gives the desired result .",
    "@xmath42    the above lemma indicates that a random xy distribution induces more uv points corresponding to short xy distance pairs .",
    "this tapers off for longer distances . with this as a starting point , we apply the minimum variance method to arrive at the target gaussian .    *",
    "given * : ( i ) a geography , that is , dimensions of the land on which to place antennas .",
    "( ii ) the number of antennas that are to be installed and ( iii ) the amplitude @xmath43 of the desired gaussian uv plane .    *",
    "goal * : to find a placement of @xmath1 antennas that yields a gaussian uv distribution centered at the origin having an amplitude @xmath43 and standard deviation @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the largest inter uv point distance .",
    ", since the area under the gaussian distribution curve before the @xmath46 coordinate closely approximates the total area .",
    "]    * approach * : we start with an overkill of antennas . instead of the required @xmath1 , we start with @xmath47 antennas and place them randomly on the xy - plane . our random choice results in a distribution of points on the uv - plane that deviates from the desired gaussian .",
    "we now try to minimize the deviation from the target gaussian by iteratively removing an antenna that causes the minimum deviation from the desired gaussian .",
    "we stop when we have removed @xmath12 antennas .",
    "figure [ fig : gaussian ] illustrates conceptually the line of approach .",
    "the two meshes indicate the starting and the final distributions .",
    "the effort will be towards minimizing the discrepancy between the distributions at every iteration when we remove an antenna .",
    "[ curves ]   antennas while the pink curve is the desired gaussian.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    * details * : as stated earlier , our random choice results in a distribution of points on the uv - plane that deviates from the desired gaussian .",
    "we then draw a fixed number @xmath48 of concentric circles with the radii increasing in arithmetic progression of common difference @xmath49 .",
    "we will show how to fix @xmath49 shortly . given these annuli",
    ", it is possible to plot a _ density _",
    "histogram of the number @xmath50}$ ] of uv - points that lie in the annuli bounded by the circles @xmath18 and @xmath51 ( for @xmath52 ; @xmath53}$ ] being the number of points in the central circle ) versus distance .",
    "thus , the total number of uv points initially is @xmath54}=\\sum_{i=1}^{p } q_i^{[\\tiny\\hbox{init}]}=m\\cdot ( m-1)/2 $ ] and area under this histogram is @xmath55}=d\\cdot\\sum_{i=1}^{p } q_i^{[\\tiny\\hbox{init } ] } = d \\cdot m\\cdot(m-1)/2 $ ] .",
    "let us now fix @xmath49 .",
    "the area under half the gaussian centered at the origin with amplitude @xmath56 and having a standard deviation of @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "thus , given @xmath43 , @xmath57 and the final number @xmath1 of antennas , we have @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , @xmath60 .    as has been mentioned previously , the central idea behind the present approach is to crop the initial curve to fit the gaussian",
