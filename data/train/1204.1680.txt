    "a single two - level atom coupled to a single cavity , or resonator , mode has been studied intensively since the introduction of this ` jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model ' independently by jaynes and cummings  @xcite and by paul  @xcite in 1963 .",
    "quantum - field effects such as periodic spontaneous collapse and revival  @xcite are now studied and observed in many systems and as a multitude of manifestations  @xcite .",
    "coupled jc systems have been proposed as a basis for quantum networks  @xcite and could behave as a novel condensed - matter system if enough jc systems can be coupled together  @xcite .    in a preliminary study we developed theoretical tools for calculating the spectrum , stationary states and dielectric susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "here we use and extend those tools , especially to include the nontrivial open - system effects of spontaneous emission and cavity losses .",
    "in particular , we consider the problem of how to probe and characterize such systems experimentally .",
    "two quite different approaches are evident .",
    "one approach is to probe each component in microscopic paradigm , namely drive and detect the various atoms and cavity modes .",
    "another approach , which we favour , is to treat the coupled jc system as a ` black - box ' model and probe it as a single unit following a macroscopic paradigm .",
    "our concept is to regard the coupled jc system as a dielectric medium whose susceptibility carries a signature of the peculiarities of the coupled jc system . diagonalizing the hamiltonian of the coupled jc system , we find entangled states and their energies .",
    "using the fermi s golden rule , we calculate the transition rates between different manifolds of the energy states of the system . in this paper , we restrict the calculation to transitions from the single - excitation states to the ground state of the system . in particular we show that the dielectric susceptibility of the coupled - jc medium reveals , by probe - field spectroscopy , quadripartite entanglement of the system comprising mutually coupled atoms and cavity modes .",
    "based on our theoretical framework for jc systems mutually coupled by overlapping extra - cavity longitudinal fields , we can calculate stationary states for the coupled system , energy spectrum , and dielectric susceptibility .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : composite ] we give a qualitative discussion and a detailed calculation of radiative properties of a single jc cell . section  [ sec3 ] is devoted to the discussion of the entangled and radiative properties of two coupled jc cells .",
    "we derive single - excitation states of the system and show that they are the w  state class corresponding to a superposition state of single excitations amongst each of the two atoms and two modes .",
    "we then find under which conditions the states reduce to the maximally entangled four - qubit w states , and how to quantify the degree of entanglement of the states using probe - field spectroscopy methods .",
    "a generalization of the calculation to an arbitrary number of mutually coupled jc cells is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we summarize our results .",
    "the jc cell ( as we refer to a single jc system ) is a composite atom cavity - mode system that radiates via two distinct channels .",
    "the closed coupled jc system is characterized by just two parameters , namely the atom - cavity coupling rate  @xmath2 and the inter - cavity coherent hopping rate  @xmath3 .",
    "one radiative channel arises due to coupling of the atom to the cavity side modes ( free - space modes ) causing spontaneous decay of the atomic excitation with an inhibited spontaneous emission rate  @xmath4 .",
    "the inhibition refers to the fact that some free radiative modes are suppressed by cavity confinement of the atom .",
    "the other radiative decay mode is due to losses from one or both mirrors of the optical cavity at rate @xmath5 .",
    "we assume independence between these two radiative channels .",
    "a single jc cell comprises a single cavity field mode of frequency @xmath6 and a two - level atom with energy states @xmath7 and  @xmath8 and corresponding energy difference @xmath9 the atom is coupled to the cavity mode with coupling constant  @xmath2 , which we choose to be real with no loss of generality .",
    "we assume that the atomic transition frequency is detuned from the cavity frequency by  @xmath10 .    in the rotating - wave approximation , and",
    "using a system of units in which @xmath11 , the hamiltonian of the single jc system  is @xmath12 with  @xmath13 and @xmath14 creation and annihilation operators of the cavity mode , respectively , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , the spin operators for the atom .",
    "the jc energy spectrum comprises a ground state of energy  @xmath18 and a ladder of doublets of energies @xmath19 the corresponding stationary energy states are the ground state  @xmath20 and the excited state doublets @xmath21 with @xmath22 note that the doublets are in a pure , bipartite entangled state of the atom and the field .",
    "this entanglement is maximal ( for all the doublets ) only when @xmath23 .     of the @xmath24 eigenstates with the detuning @xmath25 ( in arbitrary units ) ;",

    "specifically , we search for conditions that reveal whether the entanglement of the eigenstates ( [ eq : ket+-n ] ) is maximal or not",
    ".      as we have seen , each doublet has some fixed number of quanta shared between the atom s electronic state and the cavity mode field state .",
    "we employ the integer  @xmath34 to designate the number of quanta in the system .",
    "the ground state corresponds to @xmath35 , which means that the electronic state and field state are both in the lowest level .",
    "the first doublet has @xmath36 quantum , the second doublet has @xmath37 quanta , and so on .    consider first the case @xmath24 with transitions from the single - excitation states @xmath31 , with splitting due to the atom - field interaction , to the ground state , which is a product state not affected by the atom - field interaction .",
    "the transition rates from the excited states to the ground state are given by fermi s golden rule  @xcite @xmath38 these transition rates are a sum of transitions caused by spontaneous emission from the atom , with rate  @xmath4 , and by damping of the cavity mode , with rate @xmath5 . consequently the coefficient  @xmath4 quantifies the amount that the atomic spontaneous emission contributes to the transition probability .",
    "similarly , @xmath5 quantifies how much the cavity losses contribute to the transition probability .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ket+-n ] ) we readily calculate the transition dipole moments between the states @xmath31 and @xmath39 whence we obtain the transition probabilities @xmath40 a number of interesting properties are immediately evident from the expressions for these probabilities . for example , in the absence of either atomic spontaneous emission @xmath41 or cavity dissipation @xmath42 , that is when only a single dissipation channel is present in the system , the transition probabilities depend on the nature of the states from which they originate with this nature given by the parameter  @xmath43 appear in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ket+-n ] ) and ( [ eq : theta_n ] ) .",
    "this dependence on  @xmath43 causes the two transition probabilities to be mutually correlated .",
    "for example , an increase of  @xmath44 implies a decrease of @xmath45 and vice versa .",
    "the probabilities become independent of each other and their magnitudes equalize only when the states become maximally entangled .",
    "thus , we may infer from the transition probabilities to what degree the states are entangled . however , this conclusion is based on a simplified model of the system involving only a single decay channel , which is incompatible with what one encounters in practice .",
    "a practical jc system radiates through both dissipation channels .",
    "we distinguish here two parameter regimes with a qualitatively different behavior for the transition probabilities .",
    "these two regimes are distinguished according to the magnitude of @xmath5 relative to  @xmath4 . when the dissipation rates are equal , @xmath46 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_+-1 ] ) yields that the probabilities are independent of each other and have equal magnitudes , @xmath47 , regardless of the state of the system ( i.e.  @xmath43 ) .",
    "in other words , the transition probabilities tell us nothing about the nature of the states involved . in physical terms , this is a consequence of the fact that , for  @xmath48 , one can not distinguish which dissipation channel is used by the quantum leaving the jc system regardless of the initial state .",
    "therefore , determining the entanglement of the states  @xmath31 is not possible from transition rates if  @xmath48 so of course the set - up must then avoid this condition for entanglement to be measurable .    for  @xmath49",
    ", the transition rates depend explicitly on the amplitudes of the states involved thereby enabling the degree of entanglement to be discerned from the transition rates , for example by measuring the difference or the ratio between @xmath44 and @xmath45 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_+-1 ] ) we see that , for non - maximally entangled states @xmath50 , equality between @xmath44 and @xmath45 can not be achieved .",
    "however , when @xmath51 , which corresponds to the case of maximally entangled states , @xmath44 and @xmath45 have the same magnitude .",
    "equality between the transition probabilities with @xmath49 can only occur for maximally entangled states .",
    "we now consider the case @xmath52 . in this case",
    ", transitions occur between two neighboring doublets of entangled states ( @xmath53 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "notice that the transitions occur between states of different degree of entanglement , and there are two possible transition channels from each state of the upper doublet to states of the doublet below .",
    "transitions from the @xmath54 to the @xmath55 state of the neighboring  @xmath56 and  @xmath57 doublets occur with rate @xmath58 using eqs .",

    "although the transitions occur between states of different degrees of entanglement , the total transition probabilities are determined  _ only _ by the amplitudes of the states of the upper doublet .",
    "the states of the lower doublet do not become involved .",
    "the properties of the total probabilities are essentially similar to those discussed above for the transitions from the  @xmath24 doublet to the ground state . indeed , for @xmath24 the probabilities  ( [ eq : gamma_+n ] ) reduce to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_+-1 ] ) , and unequal damping rates , @xmath62 , ensures the dependence of the transition probabilities on the degree of entanglement .",
    "thus , transition rates of a combined quantum system depend strongly on how the subsystems decay rather than on the nature of states involved .",
    "the presence of the maximally entangled states in a jc cell could be observed in principle by measuring the transition rates between energy levels of the system , subject to  @xmath63 .",
    "there remains the question how these properties of the transition rates might be exhibited experimentally .",
    "probe - beam spectroscopy methods should be able to test these properties .",

    "we consider net absorption by the system of radiation from a tunable beam probing the system .",
    "the probe beam intensity is assumed to be sufficiently weak such that the field is treated to only first order in its amplitude so that it does not appreciably perturb the system .",

    "we see that as long as @xmath77 , the spectrum of the single cell is markedly asymmetric .",

    "we have studied a system of coupled jaynes - cummings  ( jc ) cells with coupling created by overlapping evanescent cavity fields or by tunneling of photons between the cells .",

    "the principal advantages of our treatment are that it allows to study the relation between the radiative properties of the system and entanglement .",
    "for example , in the case of the single jc cell we have observed that the ratio of the transition rates for the two lowest - doublet states directly reveal the degree of entanglement between the atom and cavity mode provided that the spontaneous emission rate  @xmath4 is not equal to the cavity loss rate  @xmath5 .",

    "we have found that the rates depend explicitly on properties of states in both doublets , namely that it depends explicitly on both @xmath246 and @xmath247 , but adding the transitions rates together as in eq .",

    "thus the transition rates directly reveal the degree of entanglement of the @xmath248 doublet without being mixed up with the degree of entanglement in the lower doublet .",
    "direct measurement of entanglement of the states is possible .",
    "these results on entanglement in the single jc cell are interesting and provide a foundation to study coupled jc cells .",
    "for coupled jc cells we focus only on the @xmath36 case .",
    "we have derived the explicit analytical forms of the transition rates between the @xmath36 quadruplet of states for the double jc cell to the ( product ) ground state .",
    "there are four rates in this case , and each of these rates conveys information about the degree of entanglement in the state including whether the states are maximally entangled .",
    "when loss rates from cells ( both spontaneous emission and cavity loss ) are equal , information about the degree of entanglement is not obtained by our method but is obtained for unequal rates .    finally , we have shown how to extend our two jc cell case to an arbitrary number @xmath0 of the jc cells such that each cell is coupled to all other cells .",
