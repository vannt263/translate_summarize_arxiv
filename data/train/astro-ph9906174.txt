    "quintessence offers an alternative to the cosmological constant ( @xmath5 ) as the missing energy in a spatially flat universe with a sub - critical matter density @xmath6 ( caldwell et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "it is an energy component which , similar to @xmath5 , has negative pressure and therefore a negative @xmath2 in the equation of state @xmath7 .",
    "however , unlike @xmath5 for which @xmath8 , quintessence is time evolving and spatially inhomogeneous , and @xmath2 can have a range of values .",
    "the observational imprints of the quintessence therefore differ from those of the commonly studied @xmath5cdm cosmology ( e.g. , wang et al . 1999 ) .    in this _",
    ", we study spatially flat qcdm models in which the cold dark matter and q - field together make up the critical density ( i.e. @xmath9 ) .",
    "the quintessence is modelled as a scalar field that evolves with a constant equation of state @xmath2 .",
    "it drives the cosmological expansion at late times , influencing the rate of growth of structure .",
    "fluctuations in q behave as an ultra - light mass scalar field : on very large length scales the quintessence clusters gravitationally , thereby modifying the level of cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy relative to the matter power spectrum amplitude ( in addition to a late - time integrated sachs - wolfe effect ) ; on small length scales , fluctuations in q disperse relativistically and the q - field behaves as a smooth component .",
    "we investigate the effects of the quintessence on the spectrum and time evolution of gravitational clustering in both the linear and nonlinear regimes .",
    "we propose simple , analytical fitting formulas for both the linear and fully evolved nonlinear power spectrum of matter density fluctuations in plausible qcdm models . for the linear power spectrum (   2 )",
    ", we introduce a simple parameter @xmath1 derived from the compton wavelength of the q - field to characterize its shape .",
    "this parameter determines the length scale above which the q - field can cluster gravitationally , and is reminiscent of @xmath10 derived from the free streaming distance of hot neutrinos in cold+hot dark matter ( c+hdm ) models by ma ( 1996 ) . for the nonlinear power spectrum (   3 )",
    ", we examine the validity of the simple linear to nonlinear mapping technique that has been successfully developed for scale - free , cdm , c+hdm , and @xmath11 models ( hamilton et al . 1991 ; jain , mo , & white 1995 ; peacock & dodds 1996 ; ma 1998 ) .",
    "we present a simple extension of the analytical formula of ma ( 1998 ) that closely approximates the qcdm nonlinear power spectrum computed from a set of @xmath4-body simulations .",
    "the formulas presented in this _",
    "letter _ are essential for gaining physical insight into the effects of the quintessence on gravitational collapse and for performing rapid predictions of observable quantities in the linear as well as nonlinear regimes in plausible qcdm models .",
    "we use the conventional form to express the linear power spectrum . ] for the matter density perturbation @xmath12 in qcdm models : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a normalization , @xmath15 is the wavenumber , @xmath16 is the spectral index of the primordial adiabatic density perturbations , and @xmath17 is the transfer function which encapsulates modifications to the primordial power - law spectrum .",
    "the function @xmath18 is the linear growth suppression factor , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the standard linear growth factor for the matter density field in qcdm models , and @xmath21 denotes its value at the present day with scale factor @xmath22 .",
    "we discuss each piece of equation ( [ pl ] ) in turn .",
    "1 @xmath23 ratio of the transfer functions , @xmath24 , at the present day for six pairs of flat qcdm and @xmath11 models .",
    "the solid ( for @xmath25 ) and dashed ( @xmath26 ) curves are computed from the boltzmann integrations and illustrate the dependence on the matter density parameter @xmath6 . for a given @xmath6 , the three curves illustrate the dependence on the equation of state : @xmath27 , and @xmath28 from top down .",
    "the dotted curves show the analytic approximation given by equation  ( [ kq])-([alpha ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath29 deviates from unity only on very large length scale ( @xmath30 mpc@xmath31 ) above which the q - field can cluster spatially .",
    "first we examine the transfer function for the matter density field . to isolate the effects of quintessence",
    ", we find it convenient and illuminating to compare a pair of qcdm and @xmath11 models that have the same set of cosmological parameters and differ only in @xmath2 ( recall @xmath8 for @xmath11 ) .",
    "we define the relative transfer function for a pair of such models to be @xmath32 . for @xmath33 ,",
    "we follow the convention and set the arbitrary amplitude of @xmath33 to unity as @xmath34 .",
    "the form of @xmath33 is well known and various fitting formulas have been published ( e.g. , bardeen et al . 1986 ; efstathiou , bond , & white 1992 ; sugiyama 1995 ) .",
    "more complicated fits with higher accuracy have also been developed for higher baryon ratios ( @xmath35 ) and for the features due to baryonic oscillations and damping ( e.g. , bunn & white 1997 ; eisenstein & hu 1998 ) .",
    "the transfer function @xmath17 for qcdm models resembles @xmath33 for @xmath11 but with one key difference .",
    "the linear matter density field , @xmath12 , evolves according to the equation @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and the dots denote differentiation with respect to proper time . on small length scales ,",
    "the q - field is smooth ( @xmath38 ) and we recover the familiar equation for the evolution of @xmath12 ( caldwell et al .",
    "1998 ) . on very large length scales",
    ", however , the q - field clusters and contributes to the energy density and pressure perturbations .",
    "the result is a different growth rate for @xmath12 on large and small scales once the quintessence starts to dominate the cosmological energy density .",
    "we can determine the characteristic scale separating these two regimes by examining the linear equation for the @xmath39-field : @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] ( where @xmath41 is the q - field potential , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ) .",
    "we see that @xmath44 itself behaves as a scalar field with an effective mass @xmath45 and a compton wavenumber of @xmath46 . on small length scales ( i.e. @xmath47 ) , the amplitude of @xmath44 and hence @xmath48 is damped and does not enter the evolution equation for @xmath12 . on large scales ( @xmath49 ) @xmath44 grows , so the q - field clusters and in turn affects the evolution of @xmath12 .    the change in the behavior of @xmath12 near @xmath50 as a result of differing @xmath39-clustering properties is illustrated in figure  1 for @xmath29 vs. @xmath15 for a range of @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "we have chosen to normalize @xmath29 to unity at the high-@xmath15 end because both the q - field and the cosmological constant are spatially smooth on these scales .",
    "the clustering property of q is reminiscent of the case of massive neutrinos in c+hdm models , which can not cluster appreciably below the neutrino free - streaming scale but can cluster with the same amplitude as the cold dark matter on large scales .",
    "analogous to the shape parameter @xmath10 that was introduced to model the neutrino streaming distances in c+hdm models ( ma 1996 ) , we introduce a new shape parameter @xmath1 here to characterize the feature in figure  1 in qcdm models . for a constant equation of state , @xmath2",

    "an empirical fit is given by @xmath64 [ 1 + ( 1-{\\omega_{\\rm m}}(a))/ 70 ] \\}^{-1}$ ] and is accurate to @xmath65 for @xmath66 ( carroll , press , & turner 1992 ) .",
    "this formula unfortunately can not be generalized to qcdm models by simply replacing @xmath67 .",

    "figure  2 illustrates the dependence of @xmath72 on time , @xmath2 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the growth is evidently slower in models with less negative @xmath2 for fixed @xmath6 .",
    "this is because the energy density in the q - field dominates over that in matter at an increasingly earlier time as @xmath2 is varied from @xmath73 to 0 ; the growth of gravitational collapse therefore ceases earlier and results in a smaller value for @xmath72 .",
    "( it is sometimes useful to study the instantaneous growth rate of @xmath12 , @xmath74 .",

    "it can be chosen by fixing the value of @xmath76 , the rms linear mass fluctuation within a top hat of radius @xmath77 mpc , or by fixing to cobe results .",
    "for the latter we follow bunn & white ( 1997 ) . in the case",

    ". one can rescale @xmath14 by @xmath90 to accommodate the effect of tensors on the normalization .",
    "in this section we examine if the simple linear to nonlinear mapping technique initiated by hamilton et al . ( 1991 ) can be extended to qcdm models .",
    "the basic approach is to search for a simple expression for the function @xmath91 $ ] that relates the linear and nonlinear density variance @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath93 and @xmath94 are evaluated at different wavenumbers , where @xmath95 corresponds to the precollapsed scale of @xmath15 .",
    "the strategy is to combine analytical clustering properties in asymptotic regimes with fits to numerical simulation results .",

    "we investigate if the pd96 and ma98 formulas proposed for @xmath11 models can be easily extended to qcdm models .",
    "these two formulas incorporate the time dependence of the mapping in different ways , but they share the feature that the dependence on parameters @xmath6 and @xmath97 enters only through the linear growth factor @xmath98 . in order to test the application of this method to qcdm models",
    ", we have performed @xmath4-body simulations for three values of @xmath2 : @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , each with several different realizations .",
    "these three values should be sufficient since extensive tests of @xmath101 ( i.e. @xmath11 models ) have already been carried out in pd96 and ma98 .",
    "we restrict our attention to @xmath102 and cosmological parameter ranges that are in concordance with observations ( wang & steinhardt 1998 ; wang et al . 1999 ) . specifically , @xmath103 for the @xmath104 and @xmath105 models , and @xmath106 for the @xmath107 model .",
    "the @xmath4-body code used is a parallel version of the particle - particle particle - mesh algorithm ( bertschinger & gelb 1991 ; ferrell & bertschinger 1994 ) .",
    "each simulation uses @xmath108 particles in a box of comoving volume @xmath109  mpc@xmath110 .",
    "the plummer softening length is 50  kpc comoving , which allows us to compute the nonlinear power spectrum in highly clustered regions with @xmath111  mpc@xmath31 and @xmath112 .",

    "a key difference between gravitational clustering in qcdm and @xmath11 models is that @xmath5 is spatially smooth on all length scales , whereas the q - field can cluster above a certain length scale .",
    "we characterize this length scale by the shape parameter @xmath1 of equation  ( [ kq ] ) , which is derived from the compton wavelength of the q - field .",
