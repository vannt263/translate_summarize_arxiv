    "a white dwarf can be sufficiently described by special relativistic physics without taking account of general relativity as the internal energy and pressure are both very much less than the rest mass density . following weinberg ( 1972 ) we use simple hydrostatics to get the equations of stellar equilibrium .",
    "@xmath0 thus , given an equation of state @xmath1 we can obtain the mass radius relationship of the given object by integrating up to the surface indicated by @xmath2 .",
    "assuming cold , spherically symmetric , non - rotating white dwarfs in hydrostatic equilibrium , the equation of state is provided by the pressure of the fermi gas of electrons .",
    "the equations can be integrated analytically if the equations of state are polytropic , so the non - relativistic limit gives us a mass radius relationship of @xmath3 , while the relativistic limit gives a mass , the chandrasekhar limit , independent of the radius .",
    "however the nature of the mass radius relationship in the vicinity of the critical mass is not revealed in the polytropic analysis .",
    "the objective of this work is to evaluate the radius , of a toy model proposed by jackson et al ( 2005 ) near its critical mass .",
    "its radius is shown to have a power law dependence on the mass .",
    "this scaling relation is used to estimate the mass radius relationship of a white dwarf near the chandrasekhar limit . the critical exponent evaluated in the present work",
    "is shown to fit very well with simulations for white dwarfs with a relativistic fermi gas .",
    "jackson et al ( 2005 ) define an uniform density star by @xmath4 and use elegant scaling arguments to transform to dimensionless coordinates defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , so that the equations of stellar structure become simply , @xmath8 [ hydroeqsscaled ] where the two functions on the right - hand side of the equations ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) are given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ration of the kinetic energy and rest mass of the electrons . taking advantage of the scaling relations",
    ", they express the energy per electron in units of the electron rest energy as @xmath13 where the first term is the contribution from gravitation and the second term may be evaluated from fermi - dirac statistics as @xmath14\\;.   \\label{ebar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the mass radius relation of the star is obtained by demanding hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath15",
    "to evaluate a tentative value of the chandrasekhar limit , let us evaluate the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium in the limit of @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 substituting @xmath18 , neglecting logarithmic terms with respect to linear terms and binomially expanding the square root up to terms of order @xmath19 , we have @xmath20 by the choice of the dimensionless coordinates , cumbersome constants in front of equations have been set to @xmath21 .",
    "so , substituting @xmath22 we get @xmath23 this tends to zero as @xmath24 tends to @xmath25 .",
    "taylor expanding about this point , we have @xmath26^{1/2}\\ ] ] it can be immediately seen from the above relation that the order parameter @xmath27 has a critical exponent @xmath28 .",
    "the equations of structure are now integrated numerically , using a @xmath29 points adaptive mesh , from the central region until the pressure falls off to zero .",
    "this process is carried on for different central densities in the region @xmath30 to trace out the mass radius relationship near the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "using @xmath28 , the radius is written in terms of the mass as @xmath31^{1/2 } \\label{final}\\ ] ] it is best - fitted with the simulated mass radius data to give a best fit of @xmath32 kms and @xmath33 solar masses , for a helium white dwarf .",
    "investigating the parameter space , the critical exponent @xmath34 is constrained to @xmath35 , which matches well with the prediction .",
    "[ final ] gives us the mass radius relationship of white dwarfs near the chandrasekhar limit .",
