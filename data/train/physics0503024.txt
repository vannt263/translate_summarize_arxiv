    "the concept of `` entropy '' ( from the greek @xmath12 , transformation ) , was introduced in @xmath13 by rudolf julius emmanuel clausius in the context of thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "this was motivated by his studies on reversible and irreversible transformations , as a measure of the amount of energy in a physical system , that can not be used to perform work . more specifically , clausius defined _ change in entropy _ of a thermodynamic system , during some reversible process where a certain amount of heat @xmath14 is transported at constant temperature @xmath15 , as @xmath16",
    ". we can consider _ entropy _ as the cornerstone of thermodynamics , since all the thermodynamical principles involve , directly or indirectly , this fundamental concept .    the first connection between the macroscopic clausius entropy of a system and its microscopic configurations was done by ludwig boltzmann in @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "studying the approach to equilibrium of an  ideal \" gas  @xcite , he realized that the entropy could be related to the number of possible microstates compatible with the thermodynamic properties of the gas .",
    "for an isolated system in its terminal stationary state ( _ thermal equilibrium _ ) , boltzmann observation can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath2 is a positive constant and @xmath19 the number of microstates consistent with the macroscopic state .",
    "this famous equation , known as _ boltzmann principle _ , can be regarded as a pillar in the foundations of _ statistical mechanics _ , which aims to describe the thermodynamic state of a system through the statistical approach of its microstates .    for systems which are not isolated but instead are in contact with some reservoir ( of heat , particles , etc . ) , it is possible to derive ( under some assumptions ) , from eq .",
    "( [ s_b ] ) @xmath20 @xcite , the celebrated boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath21 where @xmath22 , subject to the normalization condition @xmath23 , is the probability of the microscopic configuration @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , for equiprobability , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , then boltzmann - gibbs entropy ( [ s_bg ] ) reduces to ( [ s_b ] ) .",
    "since it refers to microscopic states , the boltzmann principle should be derivable from microscopic dynamics .",
    "however , the implementation of such calculation has not been yet achieved .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 statistical mechanics still remains based on hypothesis such as boltzmann s _ stosszahlansatz _ ( molecular chaos hypothesis)@xcite and _ ergodicity _ @xcite .",
    "it can be easily shown that entropy ( [ s_bg ] ) is _ nonnegative _ , _ concave _ , _ experimentally robust _ ( or _ lesche - stable_)@xcite , and leads to a _ finite entropy production per unit time_@xcite .",
    "moreover , it is _ additive_. in other words , if @xmath27 and @xmath28 are two _ probabilistically independent _",
    "subsystems , i.e. , @xmath29 , then it is straightforwardly verified that @xmath30 hence , if we have @xmath31 subsystems , @xmath32 , where the notation is self - explanatory .",
    "more generally , when correlations are  weak \" enough , @xmath8 is _ extensive _ , i.e. , such that the @xmath33 is _ finite_.    despite the lack of first - principle derivations , boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics has a history plenty of successes in the treatment of systems where short spatio / temporal interactions dominate .",
    "this kind of interactions favor ergodicity and independence properties , necessary in khinchin s approach of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is perfectly plausible that physical entropies other than the boltzmann - gibbs one can be defined in order to suitably treat anomalous systems , for which ergodicity and/or independence are not verified . as examples of anomalies we can mention : metastable states in long - range interacting hamiltonian systems , metaequilibrium states in small systems ( i.e. , systems whose number of particles is much smaller than avogrado s number ) , glassy systems , some types of dissipative systems , systems that in some way violate ergodicity , and , _ last but not least _ , systems with non - markovian memory , like it seems to be the case of financial ones . generically speaking , systems that may possibly have a multifractal , scale - free or hierarchical structure in the occupancy of their phase space .    motivated by this scenario , one of us proposed in @xmath34 the entropy@xcite @xmath35 which generalizes @xmath8 , such that @xmath36 , as the basis of a possible generalization of boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics@xcite and where the _ entropic index _",
    "@xmath6 should be determined _ a priori _ from microscopic dynamics . just like @xmath8 ,",
    "@xmath37 is _ nonnegative _ , _ concave _ , _ experimentally robust _ ( or _ lesche - stable _ ) ( @xmath38 ) , and leads to a _ finite entropy production per unit time _ ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , it has been recently shown@xcite that it is also _ additive _ , i.e. , @xmath39 for special kinds of _ correlated _ systems , more precisley when phase - space is occupied in a scale - invariant form .    since",
    "its proposal , entropy ( [ sq ] ) has been the source of numerous results in both fundamental and applied physics as well as in other scientific areas such as biology , chemistry , economics , geophysics and medicine @xcite .",
    "it is our purpose here to review some new results concerning applications to economics and more specifically to the theory of finances .",
    "before discussing some specific quantities of financial interest , let us see the form of the probability density function naturally derived from the variational principle related to entropy ( [ sq ] ) .",
    "we consider its continuous version , i.e. , @xmath40 ^{q}\\ dx}{1-q}. \\label{sq - cont}\\ ] ] natural constraints in the maximization of ( [ sq - cont ] ) are @xmath41 corresponding to normalization , and @xmath42 ^{q}}{\\int \\left [ p\\left ( x\\right ) \\right ] ^{q}dx}\\ dx\\equiv \\left\\langle x\\right\\rangle _ { q}=\\bar{\\mu } _ { q } \\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath43 ^{q}}{\\int \\left [ p\\left ( x\\right ) \\right ] ^{q}dx}\\ dx\\equiv \\left\\langle \\left ( x-\\bar{\\mu}_{q}\\right ) ^{2}\\right\\rangle _ { q}=\\bar{\\sigma } _",

    "consistently , for @xmath57 ( [ pq ] ) presents an asymptotic _ power - law _ behavior . also , if @xmath58 with @xmath59 ,  @xmath60 recovers the @xmath61-distribution with @xmath62 degrees of freedom .",
    "consistently , for @xmath63 , @xmath64 has a _ compact support _ which is defined by the condition @xmath65 .",
    "many other entropic forms have been introduced in the literature for various interesting purposes .",
    "one of the advantages of entropy ( [ sq ] ) is that it yields power - law tails , which play a particularly relevant role , as well known .",
    "let us recall succinctly the two basic central limit theorems : ( 1 ) a convoluted distribution with a finite second moment approaches , in the limit of @xmath66 convolutions , a gaussian attractor ; ( 2 ) a convoluted distribution with a divergent second moment , approaches , in the same limit , a lvy distribution @xmath67 ( with @xmath68)@xcite .",
    "however , through dynamics different from the convolution one , for instance with some sort of memory across successive steps ( i.e. , _ nonindependence _ of the successive distributions ) , different ubiquitous distributions might arise ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if the laplacian term in the linear diffusion equation is a standard second derivative or a fractional derivative , the gaussian or the lvy distributions are respectively attained as solutions .",
    "however , much more complex and rich dynamics clearly exist in nature , for example those associated with a variety of nonlinear fokker - planck equations involving nontrivial correlations , multiplicative noise or other effects , as we will see in the following section .",
    "moreover , simple convolutions allow only for asymptotic behavior like the @xmath11 ( gaussian ) or @xmath69 ( lvy distributions ) ones .",
    "but they do _ not _ allow fat - tailed distributions associated with @xmath70 .",
    "however , many complex systems in nature as well as in social sciences exhibit exponents which precisely belong to that interval . an example of financial interest is exhibited in fig  [ fig - dj1 ] .",

    "the solid line represents the best q - gaussian numerical adjust with @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( as obtained in  @xcite ) and the dashed line a gaussian fit . ]",
    "the gaussian distribution , recovered in the limit @xmath74 of expression ( [ pq ] ) , can be derived on a variety of grounds . for instance , it has been derived , through arguments based on the dynamics , by l. bachelier in his 1900 work on price changes in paris stock market , and also by a. einstein in his 1905 article on brownian motion . in particular , starting from a langevin dynamics , one is able to write the corresponding fokker - planck equation and , from it , to obtain as solution the gaussian distribution .",
    "analogously , it is also possible , from certain classes of stochastic differential equations and their associated fokker - planck equations , to obtain the distribution given by ( [ pq ] ) .    in this section",
    "we will discuss dynamical mechanisms which lead to probability functions with asymptotic power - law behavior of the @xmath6-gaussian form .",
    "microscopic dynamics containing multiplicative noise may be encountered in many dynamical processes and , due to its significance , has been the subject of numerous studies in the last decades .",
    "the presence of additive noise , besides the multiplicative contribution , is in fact a quite realistic ingredient since not all the fluctuations are processed multiplicatively . in previous work@xcite , we considered a class of differential stochastic equations of the form    @xmath75    where @xmath76 are arbitrary functions of the stochastic variable @xmath44 , and @xmath77 , two independent zero - mean gaussian white noises with variance @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",

    "@xmath92 the standard gaussian steady state is obtained , corresponding to a purely additive process .",

    "( [ nlfp ] ) is not exclusive of the steady state but it also emerges along the time evolution@xcite . in the presence of multiplicative noise , the system variables directly couple to noise .",
    "therefore , behaviors are observed that can not occur in the presence of additive noise alone . on the other hand",
    "the additive noise plays a fundamental role allowing the existence of a reasonable and normalizable steady state by avoiding collapse of the distribution at the origin . the particular interplay between additive and multiplicative noises , as well as that between deterministic and stochastic drifts",
    ", can lead to the appearance of @xmath6-exponential forms .",
    "the @xmath6-exponential distributions include the boltzmann - gibbs one as a special case ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "while the latter corresponds to the standard thermal equilibrium , the @xmath93 is expected to be related to quasi - stationary or long - living out - of - equilibrium regimes .",
    "intricate dynamical behavior is a common feature of many non - equilibrium systems , which can be also characterized by power - law probability density functions . to this class",
    "belong systems whose dynamical behavior shows spatio / temporal fluctuations of some intensive quantity",
    ". this quantity may be the inverse temperature , like in the case of interactions of hadrons from cosmic rays in emulsion chambers ; the energy dissipation in turbulent fluids , or simply the width of some white noise , as assumed in many financial models , such as in the famous heston model@xcite .",

    "special ( scale - invariant ) correlations , that forbid convergence to the usual gauss or lvy limits , lead to a new type of statistical distributions .",

    "the presence of two gaussian white noises , one either enhanced or reduced by internal information , and another purely exogenous , represents quite realistic features present in a variety of systems , thus justifying the ubiquity of the probability distributions associated to such kind of processes .",
    "in particular , as we have shown , they allow to model the dynamics of prizes , volatilities , stock - volumes and other relevant financial observables .",
