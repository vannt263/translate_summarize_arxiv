    "in the nonlinear @xmath9 model description of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) heisenberg model,@xcite the low - energy and low - temperature properties of the system are completely determined by three ground state parameters ; the sublattice magnetization @xmath5 , the spin stiffness constant @xmath16 , and the spinwave velocity @xmath19 .",
    "their values are not given by the theory , however , but have to be determined starting from the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "a large number of calculations of the ground state parameters have been carried out .",
    "the antiferromagnetically ordered ground state , which has been established rigorously only for @xmath20,@xcite was first convincingly confirmed also for @xmath0 in a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) study by reger and young.@xcite the sublattice magnetization obtained this way , @xmath21 ( in units where the nel state has @xmath22 ) , also indicated that spinwave theory @xcite gives a surprisingly good quantitative description of the ground state .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by singh,@xcite who carried out a series expansion around the ising limit , and found @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the nearest - neighbor exchange coupling ) , all in good agreement with spinwave theory including the @xmath26 corrections .",
    "@xcite subsequent higher - order spinwave calculations showed that the @xmath27 corrections to @xmath5 , @xmath16 and @xmath19 indeed are small .",
    "@xcite several other qmc simulations , @xcite exact diagonalizations,@xcite as well as series expansions to higher orders,@xcite have confirmed and improved on the accuracy of the above estimates .",
    "the presently most accurate calculations @xcite indicate that the true values of the ground state parameters deviate from their @xmath27 spinwave values by only 1 - 2% or less .    for most practical purposes ( such as extracting @xmath25 for a system from experimental data ) , the ground state parameters of the 2d heisenberg model are now known to quite sufficient accuracy . however , there are still reasons to go to even higher precision .",
    "one is that the model is one of the basic `` prototypic '' many - body models in condensed matter physics .",
    "it has become a testing ground for various analytical and numerical methods for strongly correlated systems , thus making it important to accurately establish its properties .",
    "another reason is the very detailed predictions that have resulted from field theoretical studies , such as renormalization group calculations for the nonlinear @xmath9 model,@xcite and chiral perturbation theory.@xcite apart from giving the low - energy properties in the thermodynamic limit , these theories also predict the system size dependence of various quantities.@xcite this is important from the standpoint of numerical calculations such as exact diagonalization and qmc , which are necessarily restricted to relatively small lattices .",
    "finite - size scaling approaches have been very successful in the study of 1d quantum spin systems , having convincingly confirmed various predictions from bosonization and conformal field theory . for example , critical exponents and logarithmic corrections have been extracted from the size dependence of ground state energies and finite - size gaps,@xcite and from correlation functions.@xcite with the concrete predictions now available , similar studies show great promise for testing theories also in 2d . for the standard heisenberg model ,",
    "finite - size scaling has been used extensively and successfully in extrapolating , e.g. , the sublattice magnetization for small lattices to infinite system size , @xcite but only a few studies have so far been accurate enough for reliably addressing the validity of the theoretical predictions for the size _",
    "corrections_. @xcite    in one dimension , exact diagonalization , and more recently the density matrix renormalization group method,@xcite enable highly accurate calculations for systems sufficiently large to approach the limit where the asymptotic scaling forms are valid.@xcite calculations with these methods in two dimensions can not reach linear dimensions large enough to verify the details of the predicted scaling forms , however . some of the expected leading finite - size behavior has been seen in exact diagonalization studies including systems with up to @xmath28 spins,@xcite but constants extracted from the size dependence",
    "are typically not consistent with other calculations .",
    "for example , @xmath19 extracted from the scaling of @xmath4 deviates by 15% from other estimates.@xcite there are hence clear indications that these small systems are not yet in the regime where only the dominant corrections are important .",
    "qmc can reach significantly larger lattices at the cost of statistical errors which are often relatively large , making it difficult to accurately extract the scaling behavior .",
    "runge carried out green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) simulations of @xmath1 heisenberg systems with @xmath2 up to @xmath3 , and found a reasonable consistency with the leading @xmath18 size dependence of the energy and the sublattice magnetization.@xcite he also noted the presence of a subleading correction to the energy,@xcite but the accuracy of the gfmc data was not high enough to extract its order , and furthermore @xmath19 extracted from the leading correction was sensitive to the subleading one .",
    "the extrapolated ground state energy obtained in this study is nevertheless the most accurate estimate reported so far.@xcite    chiral perturbation theory has recently enabled calculations of scaling forms for finite size _ and _ finite temperature for various quantities .",
    "@xcite such forms have been used in combination with qmc data in recent work by wiese and ying,@xcite and beard and wiese.@xcite their calculations employed , respectively , methods based on the `` loop - cluster algorithm '' suggested by evertz _",
    "@xcite , and a continuous - time variant of that method developed by beard and wiese.@xcite these algorithms are based on global flips of loops of spins , and overcome the problems with long autocorrelation times typical of standard suzuki - trotter @xcite or worldline @xcite qmc methods ( the continuous - time approach furthermore avoids the systematic discretization error of the trotter approximation ) .",
    "considerably more accurate finite-@xmath17 data could therefore be generated , and the leading - order scaling forms of chiral perturbation theory were convincingly verified , both in the `` cubic '' regime @xmath29 ( ref .  ) and the `` cylindrical '' regime @xmath30 ( ref .  ) .",
    "the extrapolated @xmath5 , @xmath16 and @xmath19 are the most accurate reported to date , although there are some minor discrepancies between the two results for @xmath5 ( on the border line of what could be expected within statistical errors alone ) .    in this paper , a finite - size scaling study of @xmath18 data is reported . using the the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) qmc algorithm , @xcite energy results of unprecedented accuracy are obtained for @xmath1 lattices with @xmath2 up to @xmath3 .",
    "the relative statistical errors are as low as @xmath31 . employing a recently suggested data analysis scheme which takes into account covariance among calculated quantities ,",
    "@xcite very accurate results for the sublattice magnetization are also obtained .",
    "furthermore , the spin stiffness and the long - wavelength susceptibility @xmath32 are also calculated directly in the simulations .",
    "assuming for the size dependences polynomials in @xmath8 , constrained by scaling forms for @xmath4 and @xmath5 predicted from chiral perturbation theory , @xcite all the computed quantities are included in a coupled @xmath33 fit .",
    "the quality of the qmc data for @xmath4 and @xmath5 is high enough that size corrections _ beyond the subleading terms _ have to be included .",
    "the leading - order corrections are fully consistent with the predictions . from a careful statistical analysis of the fits , bounds for the subleading terms",
    "are estimated .",
    "the subleading energy correction is found to agree with the prediction of chiral perturbation theory to within a statistical error of 5% ( the subleading correction for @xmath5 is also estimated , but has not yet been calculated analytically ) .",
    "this is the first numerical confirmation of chiral perturbation theory to subleading order .",
    "the extrapolated ground state energy , @xmath11 , is the most accurate estimate reported to date , with a statistical error six times smaller than the gfmc result by runge,@xcite and is slightly lower than his result . comparing the finite - size data of the two calculations , a clear tendency to over - estimation of the energy",
    "is seen in the gfmc results .",
    "this is likely due to a bias originating from `` population control '' in gfmc ( a small effect of this nature was in fact anticipated by runge@xcite ) .",
    "the results for the sublattice magnetization , @xmath12 , and the spin - stiffness , @xmath34 , are both slightly lower than the estimates from the finite-@xmath17 scaling by beard and wiese@xcite [ @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "although it is at this point difficult to definitely conclude which calculation is more reliable , it can again be noted that the high accuracy of the qmc data for @xmath4 and @xmath5 used in the fits carried out in this paper necessitates the inclusion of size corrections beyond the orders considered by beard and wiese.@xcite hence , any remaining effects of neglected corrections of even higher order should be smaller .",
    "quantitative estimates of such effects on the extrapolations performed here support that they are smaller than the statistical errors indicated above . for the spinwave velocity the two calculations agree ,",
    "the result obtained here being @xmath15 and the value reported in ref .",
    "being @xmath37 .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii the sse algorithm and the covariance error reduction scheme are outlined .",
    "the absence of systematic errors are demonstrated in comparisons with exact results for @xmath38 and @xmath39 lattices .",
    "the fitting procedures and the results of these are discussed in sec .",
    "the study is summarized in sec .",
    "some other problems where the methods applied here should be useful are also mentioned .",
    "the standard 2d heisenberg model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a spin-@xmath42 operator at site @xmath43 on a square lattice with @xmath44 sites , and @xmath45 denotes a pair of nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "below , in ii - a , the sse approach to qmc simulation of this model is outlined .",
    "more details of the algorithm are discussed in refs .   and .",
    "the sse method has recently been applied to a variety of spin models , @xcite as well as 1d hubbard - type electronic models.@xcite    it was recently noted that correlations between measurements of different observables can be used to significantly increase the accuracy of certain quantities calculated in sse simulations.@xcite this covariance scheme for analyzing the data is of crucial importance in the present work , and therefore this method is also described below in sec .",
    "the high accuracy of the procedures is demonstrated by comparing results for @xmath38 and @xmath28 lattices with the exact diagonalization data available for these systems .      based on the exact power series expansion of e@xmath46",
    ", the sse method @xcite can be considered a generalization of handscomb s qmc scheme.@xcite it is the first `` exact '' method proposed for qmc simulations of general lattice hamiltonians at finite - temperature ( with the usual caveat of being in practice restricted to models for which the sign problem can be avoided ) .",
    "it is hence not based on a controlled approximation , such as the trotter formula used in standard worldline methods , @xcite and directly gives results accurate to within statistical errors . despite being formulated at finite @xmath17 , temperatures low enough for studying the ground state can easily be reached for moderate - size lattices .",
    "as in handscomb s method for the @xmath0 antiferromagnet,@xcite the sse approach for this model starts from the hamiltonian written as ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48 + { n\\over 2 } , \\label{ham2}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a bond connecting a pair of nearest - neighbor sites @xmath50 , and the operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 are defined as    @xmath53 \\\\",

    "( [ partition ] ) deviates from handscomb s method,@xcite which relies on exact evaluation of the traces of the operator sequences and therefore is limited to models for which this is possible .",
    "the heisenberg model considered here is such a model ( one of the very few ) , but the more general sse approach of further expanding over a set of basis states is preferable also in this case , for reasons that will be discussed below .",
    "the objective now is to develop a scheme for importance sampling of the terms in the partition function ( [ partition ] ) . a term , or configuration ,",
    "@xmath65 is specified by a basis state @xmath66 and an operator sequence @xmath58 .",
    "the operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 can act only on states where the spins at sites @xmath67 and @xmath68 are antiparallel .",
    "the diagonal @xmath51 leaves such a state unchanged , whereas the off - diagonal @xmath52 flips the spin pair . defining a propagated state",
    "@xmath69 a configuration @xmath65 must clearly satisfy the periodicity condition @xmath70 in order to contribute to the partition function .",
    "for a lattice with @xmath1 sites and @xmath2 even , this implies that the total number @xmath61 of the off - diagonal operators must be even , and hence that all terms in ( [ partition ] ) are positive and can be used as relative probabilities in a monte carlo importance sampling procedure ( this is true for any non - frustrated system ) .    for a finite system at finite @xmath71 ,",
    "the powers @xmath72 contributing significantly to the partition function are restricted to within a well defined regime , and the sampling space is therefore finite in practice . in order to construct an efficient updating scheme for the index sequence",
    "it is useful to explicitly truncate the taylor expansion at some self - consistently chosen upper bound @xmath73 , high enough to cause only an exponentially small , completely negligible error.@xcite one can then define a sampling space where the length of the sequence is _ fixed _ , by inserting a number @xmath74 of unit operators , denoted @xmath75 , in the operator strings .",
    "the terms in the partition function ( [ partition ] ) are divided by @xmath76 , in order to compensate for the number of different ways of inserting the unit operators .",
    "the summation over @xmath72 in ( [ partition ] ) is then implicitly included in the summation over all sequences @xmath77 of length @xmath78 , with @xmath79=[0,0]$ ] as an allowed operator . denoting by @xmath80 the weight of a configuration @xmath81 ,",
    "the partition function is then @xmath82 since all non - zero matrix elements in ( [ partition ] ) equal one , the weight is ( when non - vanishing ) @xmath83 where @xmath72 still is the expansion power of the term , i.e. , the number of non-@xmath84 $ ] operators in @xmath77 .",
    "the following is only a brief outline of the actual sampling scheme .",

    "other propagated states are generated as needed .",
    "the simulation is started with a randomly generated state @xmath86 , with an index sequence @xmath77 containing only @xmath84 $ ] operators ( unit operators ) , and with some arbitrary ( small ) @xmath78 .",
    "the truncation @xmath78 is adjusted as the simulation proceeds , as will be discussed further below .    with the fixed - length scheme ,",
    "all updates of the operator sequence can be formulated in terms of substitutions of one or several operators .",
    "the simplest involves a diagonal operator at a single position ; @xmath84 \\leftrightarrow   [ 1,b]$ ] .",

    "flips around any closed loop are possible , and an additional type of update is required .",
    "it is sufficient to consider substitutions on a plaquette , of the type @xmath94[2,b_2 ]   \\leftrightarrow [ 2,b_3][2,b_4]$ ] , where @xmath95 is a permutation of the four bonds of a plaquette . for systems with periodic boundary conditions",
    ", updates involving cyclic spin flips on loops wrapping around the whole system are required ( sampling of different winding number sectors ) , and can not be accomplished by the above local sequence alterations . for the square lattice considered here , the winding number can be changed by substituting @xmath96 operators according to @xmath94\\ldots [ 2,b_{l/2 } ]   \\leftrightarrow [ 2,b_{l/2 + 1}]\\ldots [ 2,b_l]$ ] , where the set of bonds @xmath97 is a permutation of bonds forming a closed ring around the system in the @xmath98- or @xmath99-direction .",

    "is defined as a series of the single-(diagonal)operator substitutions attempted consecutively at each position in @xmath77 ( where possible ) , followed by a series of off - diagonal updates carried out on each bond , plaquette , and ring . due to the locality of the constraints in these updates ,",
    "the number of operations ( the cpu time ) per mc step scales linearly with @xmath108 and @xmath71.@xcite however , the acceptance rate for the `` ring update '' that changes the winding number decreases rapidly with increasing system size .",
    "it is therefore sometimes useful to increase the number of attempted ring updates with the system size , which then leads to a faster growth of cpu time with @xmath108 .",
    "the acceptance rate of the ring update currently used becomes too low for @xmath109 , and simulations of larger systems therefore in practice have to be restricted to the sector with zero winding number .",
    "it has recently been noted@xcite that in fact exact results are obtained as @xmath101 even for simulations restricted this way .",
    "however , compared to simulations with fluctuating winding numbers , lower temperatures are required for the system observables to saturate at their ground state values.@xcite here only systems with @xmath110 are considered , and the update changing the winding number is always included .",

    "the improved estimate of @xmath193 is nevertheless within one standard deviation of the exact result , reflecting this being the case for the more accurate energy estimate @xmath163 used in the procedure .",

    "measurements based on a particular set of configurations ( a single bin or a bootstrap sample ) will inevitably be affected by some deviations from perfect rotational invariance .",

    "the ability of the local monte carlo updates to rotate the direction of the antiferromagnetic order in spin space diminishes with increasing size , leading to large statistical fluctuations in the conventional estimate of the correlations .",
    "the fact that the energy fluctuations do not increase with the system size can , in the same way , be traced to the rotationally invariant nature of the estimator ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "a somewhat more formal discussion of the covariance error reduction scheme can be found in ref .  .",
    "simulations of @xmath1 systems with @xmath110 ( only even @xmath2 ) were carried out at inverse temperatures @xmath202 and @xmath203 . within statistical errors",

    "given the agreement to a relative accuracy of less than @xmath211 between the sse result for @xmath188 and the exact result , and the non - approximate nature of the algorithm , it is hard to see why there should be any systematic errors in the sse data for the larger lattices . note that any remaining finite - temperature effects would lead to an overestimation of the energy , and hence could not explain the discrepancy with the gfmc data .",
    "as discussed above , care has been taken to verify that in fact the finite temperature effects are well below the statistical errors .",
    "gfmc calculations , on the other hand , are in general expected to be affected by a small systematic error originating from `` population control '' of the varying number of `` random walkers '' used in that type of simulation . in runge s calculation , attempts were made to remove such bias more effectively than in previous @xcite gfmc calculations . however ,",

    "before considering the full fit ( [ allscale ] ) with all the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) , it is instructive to consider first the results of individual , unconstrained fits to all the different quantities . the effects of including the constraints can then be judged in light of these results .",

    "there are only minor changes relative to the previous partially constrained fit , the main improvement in accuracy being for the spinwave velocity .",
    "the errors of the parameters were calculated using the bootstrap method,@xcite i.e. , fits were carried out for a large number of bootstrap samples of the qmc data , and the error is defined as one standard deviation of the parameters of those fits . as explained in sec .",
    "ii - b , this should be a very accurate method for calculating statistical errors even in highly nonlinear situations such as the constrained @xmath289 fit .",
    "the qmc data used , along with the fitted curves , are shown in figs .",
    "[ figenergy][figsusc ] .    in the figures , it can be observed that even though the @xmath222 data are not included in the fit , the fitted curves extrapolated to @xmath222 are quite close to these qmc points , except in the case of @xmath290 ( for which this point can not even be included in an individual fit ) .",
    "in fact , calculating also the statistical errors of the extrapolations to @xmath222 gives strong further support to the reliability of the procedures used .",
    "for all quantities except the energy , the statistical errors are found to be comparable at @xmath222 and @xmath291 .",
    "for the energy the fluctuations are more than @xmath292 times larger at @xmath222 , due to the high order of the leading correction .",

    "these rather small deviations clearly indicate that there are only minor effects of neglected higher - order corrections .",
    "the extrapolations to @xmath298 should of course be significantly less sensitive to systematic errors , since the neglected corrections rapidly vanish for the larger sizes .",
    "as already discussed above , the neglected corrections are several times larger at @xmath222 than at @xmath188 ( the smallest size considered in the fits ) .",
    "hence , any remaining systematic errors in the infinite - size extrapolations listed in table  [ tab3 ] should be well below the indicated statistical errors .",
    "an extensive study of the ground state parameters of the 2d heisenberg model has been presented . using the stochastic series expansion qmc method @xcite in combination with a data analysis scheme utilizing covariance effects,@xcite results of unprecedented accuracy",
    "were obtained for the ground state energy and the sublattice magnetization for systems of linear dimensions up to @xmath199 . the long - wavelength susceptibility and",
    "the spin stiffness were also directly calculated in the simulations .",
    "the qmc data was extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit using scaling forms predicted from chiral perturbation theory,@xcite supplemented by higher - order terms necessary to obtain good fits .",
    "both the leading and subleading corrections were found to agree in magnitude with the theoretical predictions to within a few percent .",
    "this is the first numerical verification of the predictions of chiral perturbation theory @xcite to subleading order .",
    "the ground state energy extracted from the fit is the most accurate estimate obtained to date , and is slightly higher than the best green s function monte carlo result.@xcite this discrepancy is most likely due to a `` population control '' bias in the gfmc calculation.@xcite the spin stiffness and the sublattice magnetization are both lower than the results of a recent low - temperature loop algorithm qmc study.@xcite the discrepancy appears to be marginally larger than what could be explained by statistical fluctuations alone .",
    "for the spinwave velocity the results are consistent with each other .    in the qmc study by beard and wiese",
    "@xcite the size and temperature dependence of the uniform and staggered susceptibilities were fit to scaling forms from chiral perturbation theory .",
    "hence , the underlying theory for analyzing the data is the same as used in the present study , but the physical quantities used are different , as is the temperature regime ( low but finite @xmath17 versus @xmath18 in this study ) .",
    "since both qmc algorithms are `` exact '' , the discrepancies must originate from the scaling procedures . in this paper",
    "the effects of neglected higher - order corrections were discussed , and attempts were made to minimize these as much as possible .",
    "furthermore , as a quantitative check of remaining effects of this nature , the calculated scaling functions were extrapolated to lattices _ smaller _ than the smallest size used in the fit ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "the close ageement with the actual calculated results , along with the high orders of the largest neglected corrections , show that any effects of the higher - order terms on the extrapolations to infinite size should be well below the carefully computed statistical errors .",
    "it can be noted that beard and wiese also included subleading corrections,@xcite but not to the same high orders as was necessary in the present study ( due to the high accuracy of the sse results for the energy and the sublattice magnetization ) .",
    "another reason to believe that the present study is more reliable is that the fit involves in a direct manner the @xmath18 finite - size definitions of the same infinite - size parameters sought , not functions of those parameters .    in combination with the covariance error reduction scheme,@xcite the sse method is a very efficient method for calculating correlation functions of isotropic spin models , as exemplified by the results presented here .",
    "the covariance scheme is most efficient in cases where there are strong long - ranged correlations ( where the `` bare '' estimator for the correlation function does not behave well ) .",
    "it is currently being applied in a study the temperature dependence of the correlation length of the weakly coupled heisenberg bilayer , for larger lattices and lower temperatures than previously @xcite possible .",
    "this is motivated by recent results obtained from a mapping to a nonlinear @xmath9 model for this system,@xcite predicting a much faster divergence of the correlation length as @xmath299 than for the single layer .",
    "the sse algorithm has also proven useful in the case of critical , or near - critical systems , such as the bilayer heisenberg model close to its quantum critical point .",
    "more accurate finite - size scalings than previously reported for this,@xcite as well as other models exhibiting quantum critical behavior,@xcite are possible with the data enhanced using the covariance method .",
    "qmc methods based on the loop - cluster algorithm,@xcite have proven to be very efficient in several studies of @xmath0 heisenberg models , @xcite and are clearly more efficient than the sse method in many cases .",
    "for example , it was shown here that the covariance method can not significantly improve the accuracy of calculated static susceptibilities , which appear to be very accurately given in loop algorithm simulations.@xcite the method used here for calculating the spin stiffness directly from the winding number fluctuations would probably also be more accurate with loop algorithms . however , it is not clear whether loop algorithms can easily produce more accurate results for equal - time correlation functions or energies than those presented in this paper .    the methods discussed here can also be easily extended to higher - spin models .",
    "in fact , the covariance scheme has an additional advantage for @xmath20 , in that the on - site correlation @xmath300 is known exactly , but fluctuates in the simulation and exhibits strong covariance with other correlation functions.@xcite detailed studies of various higher - spin models should therefore now be feasible also in @xmath301 .",

    "<S> the finite - size results for the energy @xmath4 , the sublattice magnetization @xmath5 , the long - wavelength susceptibility @xmath6 , and the spin stiffness @xmath7 , are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit using fits to polynomials in @xmath8 , constrained by scaling forms previously obtained from renormalization group calculations for the nonlinear @xmath9 model and chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the results are fully consistent with the predicted leading finite - size corrections and are of sufficient accuracy for extracting also subleading terms . </S>",
    "<S> the subleading energy correction ( @xmath10 ) agrees with chiral perturbation theory to within a statistical error of a few percent , thus providing the first numerical confirmation of the finite - size scaling forms to this order . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolated ground state energy per spin , @xmath11 , is the most accurate estimate reported to date . </S>",
    "<S> the most accurate green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) result is slightly higher than this value , most likely due to a small systematic error originating from `` population control '' bias in gfmc . </S>",
    "<S> the other extrapolated parameters are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the spinwave velocity @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical errors are comparable with those of the best previous estimates , obtained by fitting loop algorithm quantum monte carlo data to finite - temperature scaling forms . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath5 and @xmath16 obtained from the finite-@xmath17 data are , however , a few error bars higher than the present estimates . it is argued that the @xmath18 extrapolations performed here are less sensitive to effects of neglected higher - order corrections and therefore should be more reliable . </S>"
