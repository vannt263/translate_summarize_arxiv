    "witten @xcite realized some years ago that the expectation value of a wilson loop @xmath0 in a chern ",
    "simons theory was a knot invariant .",
    "this follows from the fact that chern ",
    "simons theories are diffeomorphism invariant and that the wilson loops are observables for such theories , having therefore diffeomorphism invariant expectation values .",
    "the resulting knot invariant is the kauffman bracket @xcite for the case of an @xmath1 chern ",
    "simons theory and for the case of @xmath2 is a regular isotopic polynomial associated with the homfly @xcite polynomial .",
    "these results were derived based on the calculations of moore and seiberg @xcite for the monodromies of rational conformal field theories .",
    "the knowledge of the yang - baxter relations satisfied by the monodromies translates immediately into skein relations for the polynomial in question .",
    "independently , smolin @xcite and later cotta - ramusino , guadagnini , martellini and mintchev @xcite noted that a simpler heuristic derivation of the skein relations was possible .",
    "the idea is similar to the makeenko - migdal @xcite approach to yang ",
    "mills theories .",
    "it is based on studying the changes in the expectation value of the wilson loop when one performs small deformations .",
    "this calculation can be done explicitly to first order in the deformation .",
    "the results can be interpreted as skein relations to first order in the inverse coupling constant of the theory , which is tantamount to determining the knot polynomial to first order .",
    "the latter method is quick and computationally efficient , and has a simple generalization to the case of intersecting loops @xcite .",
    "the main drawback , especially in the case where the result is not known by other methods , is that one only gets the skein relations to first order in the inverse of the coupling constant of the theory .",
    "it is therefore of interest to find a suitable generalization that would yield the exact skein relations to all orders .",
    "this is the main purpose of this paper .    on the other hand ,",
    "the subject of intersecting knot invariants has received little attention and is of paramount importance for the construction of quantum states of gravity in the loop representation @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "based on the canonical quantization of general relativity in terms of ashtekar variables @xcite , wavefunctions are knot invariants due to the diffeomorphism symmetry of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint has only a non - trivial action at intersections @xcite .",
    "only intersecting knots are associated with non - degenerate spacetimes @xcite .",
    "whenever one generalizes an invariant of smooth loops to take values on intersecting loops there is generically freedom in how the invariant is defined , as long as it is compatible with the reidemeister moves .",
    "however , in the case of quantum gravity , wavefunctions have to be compatible with a set of constraints among functions of loops known as the mandelstam identities .",
    "these identities naturally involve intersecting loops and severely limit the possible generalizations of invariants to intersections .",
    "we will show in this paper how to generalize the invariants stemming from chern  simons theory to be compatible in an exact way with the mandelstam identities .",
    "this in particular also defines the values of the invariants for multicomponent links .",
    "this is of particular relevance for quantum gravity since it is known that the exponential of the chern ",
    "simons form built from the ashtekar connection is an exact solution to all the constraints of quantum gravity @xcite . if one wishes to find the counterpart of this state in the loop representation one ends up computing exactly the same integral as the expectation value of a wilson loop in a chern ",
    "simons theory .",
    "one additional motivation for the construction we present is that the chern ",
    "simons state not only arises in canonically quantized vacuum general relativity but also in other contexts , like einstein  yang ",
    "mills theories @xcite and supergravity @xcite . in these cases",
    "the ( super)gauge group of the associated chern ",
    "simons theory differs from that of gravity and therefore so do the resulting invariants . in the particular case of supergravity",
    "the resulting invariant had not been computed by other means , and turns out to be associated with the dubrovnik ",
    "kauffman polynomial @xcite .    a first attempt to obtaining a finite prescription from variational calculations",
    "was made by brgmann @xcite .",
    "in particular , the idea of exponentiating the infinitesimal transformation was presented there .",
    "because of ambiguities in the formulation presented in that paper , one could only check , given the exact skein relations , that they were compatible with the formulation . here",
    "we add two key elements that make the construction a well defined prescription : on the one hand we offer a justification of why can the infinitesimal results be exponentiated ; on the other hand we make crucial use of the mandelstam identities to uniquely fix a prescription for the exponentiation .",
    "the prescription now allows , in a case where one does not know the result beforehand , to compute the resulting polynomial .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in the next section",
    "we will discuss , using the non - abelian stokes theorem , how to perform a finite deformation of the expectation value of the wilson loop.in section iii we discuss the deformation of twists and kinks and in section iv of planar and non - planar intersections .",
    "we discuss the implications of the results in section v.",
    "one is interested in establishing skein relations for the following function of a loop ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a closed curve in a three manifold , @xmath6 is a connection in a semi - simple lie algebra and @xmath7 is the action of a chern ",
    "simons theory ,    @xmath8.\\ ] ]    finding skein relations involves relating the value of the @xmath9 for different loops .",
    "these loops are determined by the replacement of over - crossings by under - crossings in a planar projection .",
    "skein relations also arise between a loop with and without a twist , over - crossings and intersections .",
    "the usual notation for the several types of crossings is shown in figure [ skeinrelfig ] .",
    "we will see later on that the consideration of invariants with intersections requires several other crossings .",
    "for instance , the skein relations that define the kauffman bracket knot polynomial on loops without intersections are ,    @xmath10    with these relations the polynomial is completely characterized for any link .",
    "what witten @xcite showed using conformal field theory techniques is that @xmath11 satisfies the above relations .",
    "here we will show it by performing directly deformations of the loops on the expression of the expectation value .    in order to do this ,",
    "we need to study deformations of wilson loops .",
    "wilson loops are traces of holonomies .",
    "it turns out that the information needed to compute a holonomy is less than that present in a closed curve .",
    "several closed curves yield the same holonomy . in this paper we will use the word `` loop '' to denote the equivalence class of curves that yield the same holonomy for all connections .",
    "loops form a group structure called the group of loops @xcite .",
    "it is well known that if one adds to a loop another loop of infinitesimal area , the change in the wilson loop can be coded in terms of an infinitesimal operator in loop space called the loop derivative @xcite .",
    "this is shown in figure [ loopder ] .",
    "the concrete expression is ,    @xmath12    where @xmath13 denotes composition of loops , @xmath14 is the infinitesimal element of area of the the loop @xmath15 and @xmath16 is an open path connecting the basepoint of the loop @xmath5 to the point @xmath17 at which one adds the infinitesimal loop with infinitesimal element of area @xmath14 .",
    "notice that the loop derivative @xmath18 depends on the path used to compute it and we denote so in its expression .",
    "the loop derivative is related to the infinitesimal generators of the group of loops @xcite .",
    "one can write @xcite an expression for an operator @xmath19 that adds a _ finite _ loop @xmath5 to a wilson loop in terms of the loop derivative .",
    "let @xmath20 be a parameterized curve belonging to the equivalence class defining the finite loop @xmath5 with @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "consider a one - parameter family of parameterized loops @xmath22 interpolating smoothly between @xmath20 and the identity loop , such that @xmath23 is in the equivalence class of the identity loop and @xmath24 .",
    "consider the curves @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 .",
    "the two curves are drawn in figure [ stokes ] and differ by an infinitesimal element of area .",
    "the whole purpose of our construction will be to cover the infinitesimal area separating the two mentioned curves with a `` checkerboard '' of infinitesimal closed curves such that along each of them one can define a loop derivative .",
    "one can therefore express the curve @xmath20 as @xmath28 where the @xmath29 are shown in figure [ stokes ] .",
    "analytically , in terms of differential operators on functions of loops we can write dependence of @xmath30 where it is not relevant . ]",
    "@xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it is immediate to proceed from @xmath34 inwards just by repeating the same construction , and so continuing until the final curve is the identity .",
    "the end result is @xmath35 where the outer integral is ordered in @xmath36 ( t - ordered ) .",
    "this result is the loop version of the non - abelian stokes theorem of gauge theories @xcite and it shows that the loop derivative is a generator of loop space , i.e. , it allows us to generate any finite loop homotopic to the identity . due to the properties of the group of loops",
    "@xcite , the construction is _ independent _ of the particular family of loops used to go from the identity element to the final loop @xmath5 .",
    "it is useful to rewrite the expression of the operator @xmath37 as , @xmath38 where @xmath39    the operator @xmath40 is closely related to the unparameterized `` connection derivative '' @xcite .",
    "we would now like to apply the above deformation to a portion of a loop in order to construct the elements that appear in the skein relations .",
    "we start by the simplest skein relations , those that relate the value of the invariant with and without a twist . starting from a regular portion of a loop @xmath41 going from the origin to @xmath17 , one can add a twist by considering a family of loops of the form ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is a vector along the loop that materializes the deformation shown in figure [ deforfig ] .    to compute the deformation",
    ", we first evaluate the action of the loop derivative on the expectation value of the wilson loop .",
    "@xmath44    where we have taken into account that the deformation is along one element of the the family of loops @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 are the generators of the algebra @xmath47 . in this calculation",
    "we have assumed that the loop derivative acts on @xmath9 by simply acting inside the functional integral @xmath0 . this is a strong hypothesis , notice that the integral",
    "@xmath9 is diffeomorphism invariant and therefore the limit involved in the definition of the loop derivative is singular .",
    "we are assigning a value to that limit by permuting the functional integral and the limit involved in the loop derivative .",
    "we now use the fact that the field tensor is the dual of the magnetic field , which can in turn be obtained through a functional derivative of the exponential of the chern ",
    "simons state ,    @xmath48    substituting this expression in ( [ actionofloopder ] ) and integrating the functional derivative by parts we get , @xmath49 and acting with the functional derivative on the holonomy we get , @xmath50    notice that the previous expression is distributional , involving a one - dimensional integral of a three - dimensional dirac delta .",
    "it is remarkable that one can use it to obtain an expression for the operator @xmath37 that generates finite deformations . in order to see this",
    ", we first write an expression for the operator @xmath40 associated with the deformation induced by the vector field @xmath51 , @xmath52    in order to construct the finite deformation operator we need to exponentiate @xmath40 .",
    "as is shown in appendix a , one can find a regularization such that @xmath40 s at different points commute when acting on the expectation value of the wilson loop in chern - simons theory ( in general they do not commute , see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the @xmath53-ordered exponential reduces to an ordinary exponential and we get , @xmath54 when acting on @xmath9 and the integral in the exponent can be computed explicitly , @xmath55 and the sign @xmath56 corresponds to the kind of crossing generated in the loop by the vector field @xmath57 .",
    "positive sign corresponds to the right hand rule .",
    "to go from [ actionofdeltat ] to the last expression we have made use of the fierz identity for @xmath1 , @xmath58 and we performed explicitly the three one - dimensional integrals .",
    "the result is the normalized oriented volume subtended by the deformation . strictly speaking",
    ", this result implies a choice of regularization , since the type of integral that one is left with is of the form @xmath59 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this choice in the regularization is tantamount to introducing a new parameter in the derivation , corresponding to the value of the above integral . throughout this paper",
    "we will take it to be unity .",
    "otherwise , it would imply a multiplicative shift in the value of @xmath60 .",
    "the above expression can be summarized in terms of the notation for skein relations we introduced before as , @xmath61 which coincide with the skein relations for the kauffman bracket ( [ elemas],[elemenos ] ) if one makes the identification @xmath62 it is well known that perturbative techniques like the ones we are using here fail to capture the additive shift in the coupling constant first observed by witten @xcite .",
    "a discussion , and a proposal to amend perturbative techniques to capture this effect through a recourse to the semi - classical approximation can be found in awada @xcite .",
    "we could proceed in the same fashion here and modify the value of the coupling constant , but we will leave it as it is for simplicity .",
    "a kink ( discontinuity of the tangent ) is a diffeomorphism invariant feature of a loop .",
    "we will now show that the expectation value of a wilson loop in a chern ",
    "simons theory is not sensitive to the presence of kinks in the loop under the kind of regularization we are using in our calculations .",
    "this is an important result because it directly relates to the value of the invariant when one has intersections with kinks , which are crucial to implement the mandelstam identities .",
    "we will discuss this at the end of this section and will see later that the choice we make for the treatment of the kinks is central to establishing consistency .",
    "let us consider a loop with a kink like that shown in figure [ kinkfig ] .",
    "the kink defines a plane .",
    "we can deform the kink into a smooth section of the loop through a deformation in the plane .",
    "the calculation is exactly the same as that of a smooth section , so we will not repeat it here . the only precaution is to consider the appropriate tangent vector at both sides of the kink .",
    "the reason why we do not need more details is that since the deformation is planar , the contribution vanishes .",
    "basically one gets a contribution similar to ( [ actionofdeltat ] ) that has three coplanar vectors contracted with the levi  civita symbol .",
    "the case of intersections with kinks is essentially similar .",
    "there are two different types of ( double ) planar intersections with kinks , as shown in figure [ intersecfig ] .    in all cases",
    "the operator @xmath19 deforms independently each line at the intersection . for the cases with kinks that means that each kink can be deformed into a smooth section .",
    "that means that in cases @xmath63 and @xmath64 the intersection can be removed by the deformation and we get the skein relations @xmath65 that are shown in figure [ figskein0 ]    notice that in all cases the removal of kinks at planar intersections can be accomplished given a straightforward regularization of the deformation operator .",
    "this provides a justification for the identification of @xmath63 with @xmath66 that has been used in other works @xcite .",
    "we will return to discuss intersections with kinks at the end of the next section , where we will analyze a deformation that produces double lines in the loop that is of interest in the context of the exponentiation of the skein relation for straight through intersections , which we discuss now .",
    "in the case of a `` straight through '' intersection ( no kinks ) , the calculation is different than in the previously discussed cases . in this case",
    ", the wilson loop is the trace of the product of the holonomies along the petals defined by the intersection .",
    "for instance in the case of figure [ intersecdeffig ] one could write it as @xmath67 .",
    "the action of the loop derivative on the holonomy is independent of the presence of the intersection , the expression is exactly the same as ( [ actionofloopder ] ) .",
    "the difference in the construction arises when one integrates by parts . since the loop has a double point at the intersection , the functional derivative with respect to @xmath6 has two contributions at that point , corresponding to its action on the holonomy when it traverses that point the first and the second time .",
    "one of the contributions vanishes since it produces a term proportional to the tangent of the loop in the same plane as the deformation and therefore spans no volume .",
    "the other contribution is the one of interest .",
    "it can be written as , @xmath68 where we have assumed that the origin @xmath69 of the loop is in the petal @xmath70 .",
    "we now use the fierz identity ( [ fierz ] ) and compute the integral of the @xmath40 operator , @xmath71    which can be rewritten as @xmath72    a couple of remarks are in order .",
    "first , there is a difference between equations ( [ 29 ] ) and ( [ 30 ] ) , since equation ( [ 29 ] ) refers to the whole loop and equation ( [ 30 ] ) only to its intersection .",
    "the former has information about the connectivity of the loop , the latter does not .",
    "therefore , if one is to claim that equation ( [ 30 ] ) follows from equation ( [ 29 ] ) one should prove that it does so for any connectivity .",
    "for the case of double intersections , there are only two different possible connectivities .",
    "it is straightforward to check that equation ( [ 30 ] ) holds independently of the connectivity chosen .",
    "second , in spite of similarities to equation ( [ elemasmenos ] ) , equation ( [ 30 ] ) is only valid to first order in @xmath73 and needs to be exponentiated to obtain the skein relation . since equation ( [ 30 ] ) shows that the action of @xmath40 mixes @xmath74 and @xmath63 , in order to exponentiate it we need to compute the action of the deformation operator on @xmath63 .",
    "notice that this is a different deformation than the one computed in the last section , which was coplanar with the intersection .",
    "we discuss of the resulting calculation at the end of this section .    before doing that computation , it is worthwhile observing that one could combine the fierz identity ( [ fierz ] ) with the following identity , @xmath75 to get , @xmath76 and using this expression in ( [ 28 ] ) we get @xmath77    in contrast to ( [ 29 ] ) this expression leads to different first - order skein relation depending on the connectivity of the knot . if the the connectivity is such that the original loop has a single component , then the skein relation is , @xmath78 where the element @xmath79 is defined in figure [ skeinrelfig ] .",
    "the interest of this skein relation stems from the fact that the original definition of the kauffman bracket @xcite was given in terms of relations of this kind .",
    "moreover , major and smolin @xcite used this identity to derive the binor identity from the kauffman bracket .",
    "the original definition of the bracket differs from the one we use here in a factor @xmath80 to elevated to the number of connected components of the loop , which fixes the connectivity difference we encountered above .    to conclude ,",
    "we discuss the deformation of an @xmath63 as mentioned before .",
    "we need to compute the deformation of an intersection with a kink that is shown in figure [ deforrara ] .",
    "the loop starts at the origin , goes through the deformation determined by the vector @xmath57 , which we denote with a dotted line and then traverses the petal @xmath81 going through the kink and ends with the petal @xmath70 .",
    "the resulting loop has double lines . in ordinary knot theory",
    "double lines are not considered .",
    "they could be incorporated through additional sets of skein relations , as we discuss in subsection f. if one pursues a calculation similar to the ones we have been doing up to now for this case , one encounters two contributions , stemming from the volumes spanned by the deformation and the tangents to the loop at the intersection in lines @xmath82 or @xmath83 . the integrals involve terms of the form @xmath84 .",
    "the heaviside function @xmath85 limits the integral in the contribution to the corresponding petal .",
    "although these kinds of expressions can be regularized , there does not appear any natural way of assigning relative weights to the two contributions from the petals .",
    "the way we handle it here is to write the contribution in terms of two arbitrary factors @xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 where we have denoted @xmath89 the elements that result from doing the deformation up or down with respect to the plane determined by the intersection .",
    "we will see in the next section that the arbitrary factors can be uniquely determined by the mandelstam identities when we exponentiate the operator .",
    "the skein relations involving @xmath90 and @xmath74 are obtained studying the deformation of an intersection . in order to obtain these deformations in a finite form",
    "we need to exponentiate the differential expressions we obtained in the previous section .",
    "specifically , we have @xmath91    we are interested only in computing @xmath92 .",
    "we are not interested in the value of @xmath93 since as we explained before it involves double lines , which would require a separate discussion involving extra skein relations ( see subsection f ) .",
    "we do not know the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "however , since we are computing the invariant as an expectation value of a wilson loop , we expect it to satisfy the same relations that wilson loops satisfy : the mandelstam identities .",
    "we will see that imposing the mandelstam identities is enough to determine the coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 uniquely and therefore to find the skein relation .",
    "we therefore need to discuss the content of the mandelstam identities . as we mentioned before ,",
    "these identities relate the behavior of reroutings of the loops at intersections and involve non - trivial information about the connectivity of the loop .",
    "we will restrict the explicit discussion to double intersections , but it is immediate to see that suitable generalizations can be found for more complex intersections . for double intersections , one can always consider a planar diagram , and two possible routings exist , as shown in figure [ routingfig ] .",
    "each routing leads to an identity .",
    "the identities ,    @xmath94    involve different loops , as shown in the figure ( [ routingfig ] ) .",
    "moreover , they are valid for a completely arbitrary loop that has a double intersection . in order to use these identities to allow us to fix the arbitrary parameters in the exponentiation",
    ", we will consider for simplicity its expression for a particular set of loops .",
    "we will then have to check that the resulting invariant is consistent with the identities for all possible loops .",
    "the loops we wish to consider are the ones obtained by reconnecting the loops of figure ( [ routingfig ] ) with direct strands , i.e. adding no knottings or interlinkings and are shown in figures [ figureochofig ] and [ dosloopsfig ] .",
    "the mandelstam identities for these loops are ,    @xmath95    we now make use of the skein relations for intersections with kinks ( [ skeinkink1],[skeinkink2 ] ) . in equation ( [ firstmand ] ) this allows to replace @xmath96 by the unknot and @xmath97 and @xmath98 by the two component unlinked link . therefore @xmath99 .    in equation ( [ secondmand ] )",
    "the use of the skein relations is shown in figure [ dosloopsfig ] to transform @xmath100 and @xmath101 to the unknot with a twist added . using the skein relations ( [ skeintwist+],[skeintwist- ] ) one gets , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we now use ( [ skeinindet ] ) in combination with these expressions to determine the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it turns out we only need to use the expression of the exponential that appears in ( [ skeinindet ] ) expanded up to second order in @xmath73 . using this expression to determine @xmath104 , @xmath105 and",
    "@xmath106 one gets that @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this completely characterizes the skein relation for the intersections ( [ skeinindet ] ) .",
    "from there we conclude that , @xmath109    from this expression , adding an subtracting with appropriate weights the expressions with the different signs , we can work out the usual skein relation for the kauffman bracket without intersections , @xmath110 and also the definition of the expectation value for a planar straight through intersection , @xmath111 .",
    "\\label{skeinint}\\ ] ]    we therefore conclude that the expectation value of the wilson loop in an @xmath1 chern ",
    "simons theory is , up to a factor of 2 with the conventions of this paper , identical to the kauffman bracket knot polynomial .",
    "we have just shown that considering the exponential of the infinitesimal deformation to second order in @xmath73 and requiring consistency with the mandelstam identity for a particular set of loops uniquely fixes the values of the indeterminate coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 of the infinitesimal deformation . we need to check that the construction is consistent to all orders in @xmath73 and for all possible sets of loops with planar intersections .",
    "we will now show that this is the case . in order to do this , the finite version of the form of the skein relation ( [ 31 ] ) , which again can be derived in the same form as the finite skein relation we derived above is useful , @xmath112 as we mentioned before , this relation depends on the connectivity of the loop , we are assuming it is such that @xmath74 has one independent component , as shown in loop @xmath113 of figure ( [ routingfig ] ) . notice that by subtracting the @xmath114 and @xmath115 sign versions of ( [ kauorig ] ) we obtain ( [ skein+- ] ) .",
    "the sum contains the information needed to derive the mandelstam identity from the skein relations . combining ( [ skeinint ] ) with ( [ kauorig ] ) and ( [ skeinkink1],[skeinkink2 ] ) we get , @xmath116    notice that we are stretching the notation here ,",
    "since this identity is not purely local , a given connectivity of the loop was assumed to derive it , as mentioned above .",
    "therefore one has to include the connectivity we mentioned above in its interpretation . with that connectivity , equation ( [ i0w ] )",
    "is exactly the mandelstam identity ( [ 34a ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "one could have chosen a different connectivity when deriving ( [ kauorig ] ) and then one would have arrived at the mandelstam identity ( [ 34 ] ) .",
    "traditionally , in knot theory invariants have been formulated through planar projections of knots . when generalizations to intersecting knots are considered one may need to consider non - planar intersections as inequivalent .",
    "this has already been noticed for triple intersections @xcite . in this section",
    "we will discuss some skein relations satisfied by non - planar intersections .",
    "there are many types of non - planar intersections , we will restrict ourselves to some examples that have three of the four strands at the intersection in a single plane .",
    "we will show that there exists a one - parameter family of regularizations of the expectation value of the wilson loop that is compatible with the mandelstam identities for the case of non - planar double intersections .",
    "for one particular value of the parameter the intersections behave as planar ones . for other values of the parameter",
    "the intersections acquire common elements with under- and over - crossings and therefore imply the existence of distinct nontrivial generalizations of the usual invariants for the case on non - planar intersections .",
    "we consider a non - planar intersection as shown in figure [ nonplanarfig ] , which we represent with two new types of crossings , labelled @xmath117 and @xmath118 with obvious counterparts with a minus sign .    in order to compute the skein relations we consider a deformation of a straight - through planar intersection as shown in figure [ defornoplana ] .",
    "the resulting integral is exactly the same as equation ( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "the difference comes from the vector @xmath57 .",
    "that vector vanishes in the @xmath119 part of the loop .",
    "this implies that when one wants to rederive equation ( [ 29 ] ) one encounters ambiguities of the type @xmath120 exactly as when we deformed an @xmath63 intersection in a direction perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the way to handle this is again to introduce an indeterminate parameter @xmath86 .",

    "notice that @xmath86 is undetermined by the mandelstam identities and we therefore have a one - parameter family of definitions of the skein relation for the crossing .",
    "exponentiating explicitly and identifying the variable @xmath60 as before , we get , @xmath126    if @xmath127 we get that @xmath128 and @xmath129 , so the non - planar and planar intersections are treated in the same way .",
    "it is also immediate to prove from the skein relations ( [ 49],[skein+-],[skeinint ] ) that , @xmath130 so we see that for different values of the free parameter associated with the non - planar intersections we can have them play the same role as over - crossings , intersections and under - crossings .",
    "this highlights the relation between the value of the @xmath86 parameter and the different types of regularizations it implies for the intersections .    as in the non - intersecting case ,",
    "all the regular invariant information of the @xmath9 is concentrated in a multiplicative `` phase factor '' .",
    "one can divide by it and construct an ambient isotopic invariant , which for @xmath1 is the jones polynomial . in the non - intersecting case ,",
    "the writhe @xmath131 can be computed by evaluating the expectation value of a wilson loop in a @xmath132 chern ",
    "simons theory , @xmath133 with skein relations , @xmath134    if one now defines a polynomial @xmath135 through @xmath136 the result is ambient isotopic invariant .",
    "the above definition of the jones polynomial is also valid for multiloops , with a suitable generalization of the abelian calculation of the writhe for multiloops . from the expression of the resulting jones polynomial",
    "one can get an expression for the gauss linking number of two loops with intersections .",
    "the resulting expression is consistent with lattice definitions of the linking number with intersections @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss in detail the generalization to triple intersections in this paper , we sketch in this subsection how does one perform the generalization of the construction to that case . in the case of triple intersections , there are many types of possible independent vertices . in the case of planar intersections",
    "it is easy to see that one can deform them to double intersections , using the same techniques as for the @xmath63 s . for the case of non - planar",
    "triple intersections , there are 10 independent vertices . all of them can be related to double intersections through deformations similar to the one that connects @xmath74 with @xmath90 . in order to exponentiate the infinitesimal deformations",
    ", one again has to exponentiate a matrix that connects the different intersection types .",
    "it will be a sparse @xmath137 matrix .",
    "again regularization issues will leave many coefficients undetermined and one would restrict them using the mandelstam identities . it is not clear if the resulting polynomial will be completely determined by the mandelstam identities or if new free parameters will appear . as in the double case ,",
    "the mandelstam identities are non - local and there are now three different possible connectivities of intersections that are needed to implement the identities .      throughout this paper",
    "we have assumed we were dealing with loops that have each line traversed only one .",
    "if one would like the polynomial that is being derived to take values on the complete set of loops that is of interest in quantum gravity and gauge theories , one needs to consider the case of loops with multiply traversed section .",
    "this is also of importance if one is to view the integral of the exponential of the chern ",
    "simons form as a rigorous measure on the space of connections modulo gauge transformations .",
    "we present here a brief discussion of how could one consider double lines , but a complete description again requires further study .",
    "let us consider a loop @xmath5 and study the wilson loop along @xmath138 .",
    "consider a generic direction in space @xmath139 such that the tangent vector to @xmath5 is never parallel to @xmath139 .",
    "consider an continuous infinitesimal displacement of all the points of @xmath5 along @xmath139 such that an arbitrary point on @xmath5 is kept fixed ( we will call this point the origin of the loop ) .",
    "this produces a second copy of @xmath5 .",
    "if one deforms back and forth along @xmath139 in this way one ends up with two copies of @xmath5 that are connected at the origin through an intersection of the type @xmath74 , as shown in figure [ deforcuadro ] .",
    "because this is a planar deformation , the value of the expectation value of the wilson loop does not change .",
    "we have therefore reduced the problem of computing the expectation value for a loop traversed twice to the problem of computing the expectation value along a simply traversed loop with an intersection of one of the types studied before .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that applying the mandelstam identity ( [ 34a ] ) at the resulting intersection one gets the identity @xmath140 .",
    "if one wants to consider a more general situation , in which a loop could have portions that are traversed twice , one can extend the above result in a relatively straightforward manner . even if there are planar intersections of the multiply traversed segment with another segment one can separate them without additional contributions .",
    "however , if there are triple non - planar intersections involving sections multiply traversed , the deformation will give non - trivial contributions .",
    "these contributions can be evaluated explicitly given a specific loop .",
    "we have shown how to use variational techniques to obtain exact expressions for the knot invariant associated with the expectation value of the wilson loop in chern  simons theory .",
    "the method is completely general in the sense that it can be used in chern ",
    "simons theory with any semisimple gauge group with small generalizations .",
    "we have worked out explicitly the value of the invariant not only for smooth loops but also for loops with double planar and non - planar intersections .",
    "the resulting invariant is compatible with the mandelstam identities of the gauge group and therefore is suitable for providing invariants of interest as quantum states of topological field theories and quantum gravity . having a well defined linear function on the space of loops compatible with the mandelstam identities may allow also , using the techniques of ashtekar and collaborators @xcite to define in a rigorous way a measure in the space of connections modulo gauge transformations @xmath141 . such a measure would allow to give rigorous meaning in a mathematical sense to expression of the form @xmath142 for any gauge invariant function @xmath143 .",
    "the generalization of the work described in this paper to triple intersections is straightforward and relevant for quantum gravity applications .",
    "the possibility of computing explicitly the knot polynomials associated with chern  simons theory for any group is clearly of relevance in other physics applications , like the recent discovery of chern  simons states in supergravity has shown @xcite .",
    "it is expected that these results will be extendible to @xmath144 supergravity where this method will provide with a simple method of characterizing the potentially new invariants that may arise .",

    "the first @xmath40 acts as indicated in ( [ actionofdeltat ] ) , and using the fierz identity we get , @xmath145    the second @xmath40 has two contributions , stemming from the action of the loop derivative on the loop dependence of @xmath9 and @xmath146 respectively .",
