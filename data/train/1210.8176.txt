    "spectrum sensing is a key step in effectively realizing cognitive radio networks ( crn ) . in the cr access paradigm ,",
    "secondary users ( su ) in a crn are allowed to access spectrum reserved for use by licensed or primary users ( pu ) given that 1 ) those resources are either currently unoccupied or 2 ) interference to the primary network is kept under an acceptable level @xcite .",
    "the main goal of spectrum sensing is to accurately and efficiently detect the presence or absence of a pu in a given band .    several spectrum sensing",
    "methods have been proposed in the literature @xcite . in general",
    ", these methods can be categorized as being based on either energy detection , spectral correlation ( cyclostationarity ) , or matched filtering .",
    "energy detection requires the least prior knowledge about the signal , while matched filtering requires the most .",
    "spectral correlation - based techniques lie in between , requiring either prior knowledge or accurate estimation of the cyclic frequencies present in the pu transmission signal .",
    "although energy detection offers the lowest computational complexity and is the optimal blind detector in the presence of i.i.d .",
    "noise , its performance relies on accurate knowledge of noise power due to the snr wall phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the detection performance of energy detection also degrades in a temporally correlated noise environment .    in some scenarios ,",
    "spectral correlation - based methods offer several advantages over other spectrum sensing approaches . unlike energy detection",
    ", they do not suffer from the snr wall issue .",
    "these methods are also resilient to temporally correlated noise and enable signal - selective spectrum sensing where the presence a signals - of - interest ( soi ) can be detected based on their unique cyclic features due to their modulation type , symbol rate , and carrier frequency @xcite .    one issue encountered with all spectrum sensing methods is the effect of a fading in the channel between the pu and su .",
    "there is some probability of low detection performance whenever the channel is in a deep fade .",
    "this can be alleviated by exploiting spatial diversity either through the use of cooperative spectrum sensing @xcite or if available , the use of multiple antennas . as a result , spectrum sensing algorithms exploiting multiple antennas have received considerable interest @xcite .",
    "algorithms that leverage the cyclostationarity property have been applied in the past for multiple antenna receivers . in @xcite , the sum of the individual cyclic correlation for each antenna",
    "was proposed .",
    "such methods are considered _ post - combining _ techniques since knowledge of the channel state information ( csi ) is not exploited . on the other hand ,",
    "_ pre - combining _ techniques which utilize an estimate of the csi to varying degrees have been shown to have better performance .",
    "a method based on equal gain combining ( egc ) , was investigated in @xcite .",
    "this method uses phase offset estimates to align the raw samples from each antenna .",
    "the aligned signals are then summed before finding the cyclic correlation .",
    "finally , a blind maximal ratio combining ( bmrc ) scheme was evaluated in @xcite which utilized the singular value decomposition ( svd ) to find an estimate of the csi and applied mrc on the raw samples .    in this paper",
    "we propose a spectrum sensing algorithm designed for use in a multiple antenna system based on the cyclic correlation significance test ( ccst ) .",
    "the ccst was used in @xcite to perform cyclostationary source enumeration using an information - theoretic criterion .",
    "however , the performance of this statistic in the context of multiple - antenna cyclostationary spectrum sensing has not been investigated in prior work .",
    "the performance of this method in fading channels has also not been evaluated . in this paper , we show that the proposed method has better detection performance than existing methods and has less computational complexity than bmrc from @xcite .",
    "we investigate the algorithm s performance in both uncorrelated and correlated noise environments .",
    "the scheme s robustness to intereference is also shown .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is introduced in section [ sec : model ] including a brief discussion of cyclostationarity .",
    "the proposed algorithm is detailed in section [ sec : proposed ] .",
    "numerical results for various scenarios are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "a signal is considered to be cyclostationary if its statistical properties are periodic .",
    "equivalently , if the cyclic autocorrelation function , defined as : @xmath0 is non - zero with some @xmath1 for at least one @xmath2 , the signal is said to exhibit second - order cyclostationary property with @xmath3 referred to as the cyclic frequency .",
    "for example , in bpsk signals , cyclostationary features exist at @xmath4 and at @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the symbol period , @xmath7 is the carrier frequency , and @xmath8 .",
    "detailed analysis of the cyclostationary features for various digital modulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "we adopt a similar signal model as that used in @xcite . the spectrum sensing problem is to decide between two hypotheses :",
    "@xmath9 , where the signal is absent ; and @xmath10 , where it is present . the received signal samples under the two hypothesis are given respectively as follows : @xmath11 the received signal , sampled at a rate of @xmath12 , forms @xmath13 streams coming from each antenna with @xmath14 samples each .",
    "this received signal is defined as @xmath15^{t}$ ] .",
    "the received signal is the superposition of @xmath16 signal sources ( including both the soi and any interferers ) and can be expressed in vector form as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the convolution operation over @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the receiver noise denoted by @xmath21^{t}$ ] , where every @xmath22 is a purely stationary gaussian random process ( @xmath23 for any @xmath24 ) with variance of @xmath25 . for simplicity , we restrict that only one pu transmission , @xmath26 ,",
    "is considered a soi and that it is cyclostationary with a unique cyclic frequency at @xmath27 .",
    "the other sources are considered interferers .",
    "the channel experienced by each of the @xmath16 sources is given by @xmath28^{t}$ ] , where @xmath29 is the channel between the @xmath30th source and the @xmath31th antenna .",
    "we assume that the channel , although unknown to the receiver , stays constant over the frame of observation .      in the case of spatially",
    "correlated noise , which can happen when there is substantial ambient noise in the band , we model @xmath20 to have a covariance matrix given by @xmath32 .",
    "thus with @xmath33 , the covariance matrix simplifies to an identity matrix giving spatially white noise , while @xmath34 gives fully correlated noise over all antennas .",
    "varying degrees of partial correlation can be achieved by setting @xmath35 .",
    "in this section , we describe the proposed method .",
    "we focus on a single cycle frequency detection , but this approach could be generalized to multi - cycle detection .",
    "the key idea of this detection algorithm is based on the theory of canonical variates or theory of common factors . as discussed in @xcite , and",
    "subsequently utilized in @xcite , the number of common factors between two @xmath36 time - series vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be inferred from the rank of the matrix @xmath39 where the covariance matrices are defined as the time average @xmath40 . in the non - asymptotic case ,",
    "when this matrix is always full rank , a threshold on the eigenvalues can be applied to determine the asymptotic rank with a given confidence level .",
    "the same criterion , referred to as the cyclic correlation significance test ( ccst ) , was applied for cyclostationary source enumeration in @xcite by taking @xmath41 and @xmath42 for a given lag @xmath1 and cyclic frequency @xmath3 .",
    "additionally , some cyclic frequencies , such as those located on @xmath43 for bpsk , only appear in the conjugate cyclic correlation matrix by instead taking @xmath44 .",
    "we further adapt the ccst into the binary hypothesis test required for signal - selective spectrum sensing . under @xmath9 , ( [ eqn : commonfactors ] ) will have zero rank as @xmath45 .",
    "thus , by applying a threshold to all the eigenvalues we can infer the presence or absence of the pu of interest using a @xmath13 antenna receiver .",
    "prior to performing the detection , we pick the lag @xmath1 that provides the best detection performance based on the modulation format used by the pu .",
    "this could be done off - line by performing the maximization , @xmath46 .",
    "the steps of the algorithm are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "estimate the covariance matrix of size @xmath47 @xmath48 2 .",
    "estimate the cyclic correlation matrix using a cyclic cross - correlogram at cyclic frequency @xmath3 and lag @xmath49 , defined as @xmath50 we will refer to the @xmath49-lag covariance matrices for both conventional and cyclic autocorrelation function simply as @xmath51 and @xmath52 from this point for the sake of brevity , since other @xmath1 are not utilized by the proposed algorithm .",
    "the dependence on @xmath1 will be indicated explicitly whenever necessary .",
    "the ccst is then calculated by finding the matrix @xmath53 3 .",
    "calculate its singular value decomposition ( svd ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are unitary matrices whose columns are the left and right singular vectors , respectively and @xmath57^{t}$ ] is the diagonal matrix of real , non - negative singular values , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the identity matrix of size @xmath60 .",
    "4 .   compute the test statistic by taking @xmath61 the factor @xmath14 is used to scale the test statistic so that its distribution is independent of the number of samples used .",
    "decision : @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a threshold chosen to achieve constant false alarm rate ( cfar ) which will be discussed in the following section .",
    "note that all @xmath64 can be replaced with @xmath65 if the conjugate cyclic correlation matrix is needed .",
    "we refer to these two metrics as the non - conjugate cyclic correlation significance test ( nc - ccst ) and the conjugate cyclic correlation significance test ( c - ccst ) respectively .",
    "two key parameters are used to evaluate the performance of spectrum sensing algorithms .",
    "the detection probability or @xmath66 is the probability of being at @xmath10 and accurately detecting the pu ( @xmath67 ) . on the other hand , the false alarm probability , @xmath68 ,",
    "is the probability of being at @xmath9 and mistakenly detecting a pu ( @xmath69 ) .    it has been shown in @xcite that the limiting distribution ( @xmath45 ) of the test statistic based on the nc - ccst in ( [ eqn : teststatistic ] ) approaches a @xmath70 distribution with degree - of - freedom @xmath71 . following a similar proof , it can be shown that the distribution for the c - ccst is also @xmath70 but with degree - of - freedom @xmath72 .",
    "based on these asymptotic distributions of @xmath73 under @xmath9 , the detection threshold @xmath74 can be set to achieve a desired @xmath68 by satisfying @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the probability density function ( pdf ) of a @xmath70 random variable with degree - of - freedom @xmath31 .",
    "these asymptotic distributions are verified to closely match simulation in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] for @xmath78 . due to the scaling factor in ( [ eqn : teststatistic ] ) , the distribution is independent of @xmath14 if the number of samples is large enough .",
    "the empirical pdfs for two different @xmath25 values are also shown to demonstrate how the test statistic s distribution under @xmath9 is independent of noise power .     with different number of antennas ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "simulated pdfs for different noise variances ( @xmath80 ) show both the accuracy of the approximation and the test statistic s independence to noise power . the same number of samples @xmath78 per antenna is used . ]",
    "the algorithms for multiple - antenna spectrum sensing that exploit cyclostationarity that are currently in the literature can generally be classified into two categories .",
    "techniques that do not exploit any knowledge of the csi are referred to as _ post - combining _ methods .",
    "the simplest method to do this is to find the sum of the spectral correlation test statistic estimated individually from each antenna @xcite .",
    "we refer to this approach as sum - msdf ( where msdf means modified spectral density function ) .",
    "the msdf is defined as the spectral correlation function normalized by signal energy as discussed in @xcite .",
    "another existing approach is to sum the raw signals from each antenna and then perform a single spectral correlation test .",
    "however , we encounter a problem when the channel is not simply awgn but instead has random fading . in this case",
    ", each antenna will have some unknown phase offset and attenuation .",
    "thus , simply adding the raw signals non - coherently would decrease the probability of detection .",
    "this problem is addressed in @xcite by first aligning the phase of each antenna .",
    "an estimate of the relative phase difference between each antenna is calculated by finding both the cyclic correlation of one antenna chosen as reference ( auto - scf ) and the cross - cylic correlation of every other antenna and the reference antenna .",
    "the phase difference can then be extracted from these two .",
    "we refer to this method in our comparisons as egc .",
    "finally , mrc is used in @xcite .",
    "blind channel estimation is achieved by taking the vector corresponding to the highest singular value of ( [ eqn : cycliccovariance ] ) as an estimate of the channel , @xmath81 .",
    "the raw samples from each antenna are combined using @xmath82 the cyclic correlation test is then performed on the combined samples @xmath83 .",
    "this method is called msdf with blind maximal ratio combining or bmrc - msdf .",
    "it was shown to outperform the other techniques but at the cost of additional complexity due to the channel estimation and combining .",
    "one issue with this approach is the fact that the cyclic correlation is calculated twice .",
    "the first is used to blindly estimate the channel and the second to perform the detection on the combined samples . in contrast , the method proposed in this paper , which we refer to as eigenvalue - based cyclostationary spectrum sensing or ev - css only needs to perform the first part of bmrc - msdf , the svd , and uses the singular values themselves to infer the presence or absence of the pu .      as with other cyclostationarity - based spectrum sensing algorithms , one major advantage of the proposed method is its robustness to the noise uncertainty problem . since the noise is assumed to be stationary and does not exhibit cyclostationarity at any @xmath2 , its cyclic correlation approaches zero as @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the effect of any error in the noise power estimate on the detection probability can be eliminated by taking more samples . however , in the interest of conserving power and arriving at a timely decision , both of which are high priority in the case of cr applications , we aim to minimize @xmath14 needed to achieve a target @xmath66 .",
    "this presents another , more subtle , issue related to noise uncertainty .    in the non - asymptotic scenario ,",
    "the scf under @xmath9 has been shown to depend on both @xmath14 and the noise power @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the proper detection threshold is still a function of the noise variance . by incorrectly specifying this threshold",
    ", the detector could be at the wrong point in the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve .",
    "equivalently , the target cfar can not be achieved . however , as previously discussed and demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] , the proposed test statistic is independent of both @xmath25 and @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , the threshold @xmath74 only needs to be chosen once for a given number of antennas @xmath13 to guarantee cfar .",
    "this property has been shown for other eigenvalue - based approaches @xcite .",
    "it derives from the fact that noise power estimation is built - in to the algorithm .",
    "we can make an approximate complexity comparison of the proposed algorithm with the best performing existing algorithm ( bmrc - msdf ) by taking number of complex multiplications required for each under the same number of samples @xmath14 .",
    "since the cyclic covariance operation and the svd are common to both algorithms they are not included in the analysis .    assuming the msdf is calculated using an @xmath85-point fast fourier transform ( fft ) it requires in the order of @xmath86 multiplications .",
    "in addition , @xmath87 multiplications are needed to perform the mrc and normalization .",
    "finally , the correlation in frequency uses @xmath88 multiplications .",
    "thus , the bmrc - msdf approach performs in the order of @xmath89 multiplications without the svd and the cyclic covariance .    in comparison",
    ", the proposed ev - css method finds the conventional covariance in addition to the same svd and cyclic covariance as bmrc - msdf , or in the order of @xmath90 multiplications .",
    "the operation @xmath91 in ( [ eqn : metric ] ) is essentially the solution to a generalized linear system which can be seen as an lu decomposition requiring approximately @xmath92 multiplications .",
    "therefore , the ev - css approach requires in the order of @xmath93 multiplications in addition to the common operations with bmrc - msdf .",
    "since @xmath13 is typically much less than both @xmath14 and @xmath85 , there is overall a significant decrease in complexity with the proposed algorithm .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath78 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , ( same parameters used in @xcite ) , the bmrc - msdf requires @xmath96296k multiplications while ev - css needs only @xmath9616k multiplications , without counting the common operations .",
    "in this section , simulation results are presented in order to compare the proposed algorithm with the various existing techniques discussed in section  [ subsec : others ] .",
    "the pu is assumed to be transmitting a bpsk signal at a carrier frequency @xmath97 khz with symbol period of 25 @xmath98s .",
    "the su is assumed to have @xmath95 antennas unless otherwise specified .",
    "each antenna is sampled at a rate @xmath99 khz . for cfar experiments we set @xmath100 .    in all experiments ,",
    "the channel between the pu and each antenna of the su , @xmath101 , is modeled as a quasi - static rayleigh fading channel , where the fading remains constant during the whole frame of @xmath78 samples per antenna used for detection .",
    "this can be described using a channel vector for the @xmath102th frame as @xmath103^{t}$ ] , where @xmath104 is a rayleigh distributed random variable of unit variance and @xmath105 is a uniformly distributed random variable in @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "we ignore dispersive channels where each element of @xmath107 is modeled as a multi - tap filter , @xmath108 , since cyclostationary spectrum sensing has already been shown to be robust to the effects of temporal correlation in prior work @xcite .    for all algorithms , the same cyclic frequency located at @xmath109",
    "this cyclic feature has been shown to only be present in the conjugate cyclic autocorrelation which means the c - ccst statistic is used for the proposed algorithm .",
    "this feature is chosen because of its relative strength compared to other cyclic frequencies .",
    "the maximum cyclic autocorrelation at this cyclic frequency is observed at @xmath110 . as for the algorithm that computes the msdf ,",
    "the frequency resolution is chosen to be @xmath111 .      in the case where the noise between each antenna is uncorrelated ( @xmath112 ) and only the soi occupies the observed band",
    ", the roc curve completely determines the performance of each detection algorithm under a given snr and @xmath14 .",
    "a comparison of these roc curves for the algorithms discussed are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : roc ] . for these simulations",
    "the snr is fixed at -14 db , although the trends are consistent for other snr in the range @xmath113 $ ] db where the experiments were conducted .",
    "as seen from this figure , the proposed method has better detection performance than any of the other algorithms .",
    "interestingly , the method also outperforms bmrc - msdf which as discussed in section  [ subsec : complexity ] has significantly higher computational complexity .",
    "although this result initially appears to be counter - intuitive , further experiments show that in the case of perfect csi ( not shown in figure ) the mrc - msdf has comparable performance to ev - css .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that at very low snr the blind channel estimates based on the svd have large errors and the full benefit of mrc is not achieved .",
    "in contrast , the ev - css is able to fully take advantage of the information from all antennas because it does not directly use an estimate of the csi .     and",
