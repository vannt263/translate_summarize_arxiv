    "these two terms have a relative phase between them .",

    "<S> introduction. _ one of the most striking implications of the theory of the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect is the nature of the elementary excitations ( `` anyons '' ) , featuring fractional charge and fractional statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the latter concerns the change in the state of the system upon braiding the anyons : it is multiplied by a phase in the abelian case , and by a unitary operator in the non - abelian case , thus raising the prospect of topologically - protected quantum computation @xcite . experimental evidence for fractional </S>",
    "<S> charge dates back almost two decades ago @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notwithstanding intriguing results @xcite , fractional statistics has remained elusive to date . </S>",
    "<S> a natural probe of statistics is through its effect on the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) interferometry of anyons moving along the gapless edges of a fqh system . </S>",
    "<S> mach - zehnder interferometers @xcite would have been efficient tools to observe anionic interferometry as they avoid interference - masking coulomb effects @xcite and are robust against further quasiparticle fluctuations in the bulk @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the interfering paths of a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) rely on the chiral edge modes of the fqh geometries . </S>",
    "<S> multimode edges @xcite present one with an interesting twist : the possibility of upstream moving modes ( i.e. , modes moving against the `` downstream '' direction set by the magnetic field ) . </S>",
    "<S> these may be neutral @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such modes have been experimentally detected through the generation of upstream charge noise @xcite and thermometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent measurements @xcite have surprisingly found that , unlike earlier predictions , upstream neutral modes are not restricted to `` hole - like '' states ( e.g. , @xmath1 ) , but rather show up in virtually _ all _ fqh states , including simple `` electron - like '' laughlin states ( such as @xmath2 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> how do these upstream moving modes affect the expected anyonic interference ?    here </S>",
    "<S> we show that their effect on the anyonic interference visibility is detrimental . </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis , employing the example of a @xmath0 fqh system @xcite , entails a single upstream - propagating neutral mode along the edge of a mzi . </S>",
    "<S> we note that our picture holds for more complex edge profiles than the minimal ones dictated by the bulk properties @xcite , and for other setups which support upstream moving modes , be them neutral or charged . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the suppression of the interference visibility is due to downstream - upstream mode entanglement : the upstream ( e.g. , neutral ) mode serves as a `` which path '' detector of the downstream ( charged ) quasiparticle trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the dependence of the entanglement on the system s characteristics ( geometry , temperature , voltage bias ) , and discuss the parameter regime where the charge and neutral degrees of freedom may be disentangled , leading to recuperation of the interference signal .    from a broader perspective , here we explore how these two experimental facts , namely the undetectability of anyonic ab fringes in mzi ( unlike the high visibility of interference in the integer qh regime @xcite ) , and the ubiquity of upstream neutral modes in fqh systems , are related . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the latter leads to an exponential suppression of the former . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case even with an equal - arms - length mzi , where thermal averaging is avoided in standard scenarios .    _ </S>",
    "<S> the main idea _ is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : interference ] . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the manifestation of interference of two paths ( `` coherency '' ) requires that the difference between the propagation time along each one of them is smaller than the inverse of the energy window @xmath3 over which one is averaging ( coherence time ) , e.g. , the thermal spread @xmath4 . when only a single downstream charge mode with velocity @xmath5 is present [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : interference](b ) ] , it follows that observing interference requires @xmath6 . in a real - space picture , this means that there should be a significant overlap between the two interfering charge wavelets , i.e. , that their spatial separation , @xmath7 , is smaller than the wavelet size @xmath8 . from both perspectives , for a symmetric interferometer ( @xmath9 ) , energy averaging due to the finite width ( @xmath10 ) of the incoming wavepackets does not undermine the interference .    in the presence of an upstream neutral mode ( with velocity @xmath11 ) [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : interference](c ) ] , tunneling through the bridges ( or quantum point contacts , qpcs ) a or b involves the excitation of neutral wavepackets or `` jets '' . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the interfering amplitudes at d@xmath12 can be schematically written as @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the sum of the ab and the orbital phase differences between the two paths . for interference to show up , there must be nonvanishing overlap between corresponding pairs of neutral wavepackets , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for example , are separated in space and time , as it takes the charge mode some time to propagate from qpc a to qpc b. their separation in time is then @xmath19 ( it is @xmath20 for the neutral jets on the upper arm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap between neutral jets decreases with the overall size of the mzi , and can not be compensated by resorting to a symmetric setup , but only by reducing the temperature and voltage . due to the expected smallness of the neutral mode velocity ( stiffness ) </S>",
    "<S> , these restrictions can be quite severe in practice .    _ </S>",
    "<S> model. _ to substantiate this idea we focus on the kane - fisher - polchinski ( kfp ) @xcite model of the @xmath0 fqh state . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be thought of as a @xmath2 state of holes on top of a @xmath21 state of electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the edge theory consists of a downstream @xmath21 mode @xmath22 and an upstream @xmath2 mode @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of disorder typically leads to equilibration between the edge modes , and results in a universal fixed point ( with nonuniversal mode velocities ) . there </S>",
    "<S> the charge and neutral sectors , given by the linear combinations @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , are decoupled .    </S>",
    "<S> the operators @xmath26 , with integer @xmath27 and @xmath28 , correspond to the creation of a quasiparticle of charge @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling dimension of an inter - edge tunneling process involving such a quasiparticle at the kfp fixed point is @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical ( braiding ) phase of two such quasiparticles with quantum numbers @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , is @xmath33 . for an almost - open qpc it is sufficient to address the most relevant ( in the renormalization group sense ) tunneling operators , involving three types of quasiparticles ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> table  [ tbl : qps ] ) . of these , only @xmath34 includes just the innermost mode @xmath23 , hence it should have the largest bare tunneling amplitude and give the dominant contribution . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for an almost - closed qpc , one needs to consider the most relevant processes in which _ integer _ charge ( electrons ) is transferred . </S>",
    "<S> of these two ( see table  [ tbl : qps ] ) , the most important is @xmath35 , as it depends only on the outermost mode @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> in either case the most important tunneling operator involves both charge and neutral modes , hence tunneling of charge excites the neutral modes on both sides of the qpc . </S>",
    "<S> below we first consider tunneling processes involving only @xmath36 ( quasiparticle ) or @xmath35 ( electron ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we later discuss what happens when all the most relevant tunneling operators listed in table  [ tbl : qps ] are present , and show that this does not modify our results in an essential way .    </S>",

( [ eqn : j ] ) upon a shift of the integration variable @xmath50 by @xmath51 ; in particular , for a symmetric interferometer , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the amplitude of the flux - dependent contribution to eq .  ( [ eqn : ik ] ) has the same magnitude as the flux - independent term ( barring additional dephasing mechanisms beyond our model ) , and the visibility can reach unity even at finite @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> taking the neutral modes into account , @xmath48 depends on both @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the visibility is suppressed at finite @xmath58 and @xmath55 even in the symmetric case , once either energy scale becomes larger than the inverse of the delay time ( between neutral modes emitted when charge tunnels at either qpc ) @xmath59 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a summary of the results in this case is given in table  [ tbl : visibility ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : visibility ] . </S>",
    "<S> detailed analysis of the general case is presented in the supplemental material @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> accounting for all the most relevant quasiparticle tunneling operators. _ up to this point we have restricted ourselves to the case where only the charge-@xmath60 tunneling operator involving the inner - most edge mode ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> table  [ tbl : qps ] ) is considered , since it is expected to have the largest amplitude in the weak tunneling regime . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling quasiparticle fractionalizes into the charge and the neutral modes , which results in the suppression of the interference signal . </S>",
    "<S> including the other @xmath60 most - relevant operator ( again with charge - neutral fractionalization ) will not modify the results qualitatively . on the other hand , the charge-@xmath61 most relevant operator creates _ no neutral excitations _ </S>",
    "<S> , hence it _ may _ contribute to the interference . </S>",
    "<S> however , let us first note that the bare amplitude of the @xmath61 tunneling operator should be much smaller than that of the @xmath60 ones . </S>",
    "<S> we then recall that in the fractional case the phase shift of the ab signal depends on the number of quasiparticles which have tunneled earlier and got trapped at d@xmath12 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : interference](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the tunneling of charge-@xmath60 quasiparticles shifts the interference signal of the charge-@xmath61 quasiparticles erratically by @xmath62 , thus undermining the visibility . to see that , </S>",
    "<S> let us focus on the regime @xmath63 , where only tunneling from high to low voltage is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> we will further assume that @xmath64 $ ] , so that processes involving neutral excitations do not contribute to the interference at all . </S>",
    "<S> we may then describe the dynamics employing a master equation . </S>",
    "<S> it has three states , corresponding to charge @xmath65 accumulated at d@xmath12 , modulo the electron charge ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the probability to find the system in state @xmath66 will be denoted by @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> transitions between these three states occur due to quasiparticle tunneling . since charge-@xmath60 quasiparticles tunnel without interference , the corresponding tunneling rate , to be denoted by @xmath68 , is independent of either the enclosed flux or the accumulated charge at the drain d@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case for charge-@xmath61 quasiparticles , for which the tunneling rate corresponding to a transition @xmath69 ( mod 3 ) may be written as @xmath70 , with positive @xmath71 , where equality is reached only for @xmath72 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the ensuing master equation is then : @xmath73 the steady state current @xmath74 is    @xmath75    + \\left [ \\left ( \\gamma_{2 } \\right)^3 - 3 \\gamma_{2 } \\left ( \\frac{\\gamma_{2}^\\prime}{2 } \\right)^2 + 2 \\left ( \\frac{\\gamma_{2}^\\prime}{2 } \\right)^3 \\cos \\left(2 \\pi \\phi_{ab}/\\phi_0 + 3 \\phi_2 \\right ) \\right ]    } {    \\left ( \\gamma_1 \\right)^2    + \\gamma_1 \\gamma_{2 }    + \\left [ \\left ( \\gamma_{2 } \\right)^2 - \\left ( \\frac{\\gamma_{2}^\\prime}{2 } \\right)^2 \\right ]    } \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    hence , if the tunneling amplitude of charge-@xmath61 quasiparticles is smaller than the corresponding amplitude for charge-@xmath60 quasiparticles ( as one physically expects ) , the visibility ( ratio of the amplitudes of the flux - dependent and flux independent current ) scales as @xmath76 , that is , as the _ sixth _ power of the tunneling amplitudes ratio , which could be quite small in practice ( it is of order @xmath77 already for a 1/3 amplitude ratio ) .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion. _ the specific analysis presented here concerns a minimal model for the edge of the @xmath0 fqh state , that supports a charged downstream moving mode as well as a neutral upstream mode . the tunneling of quasiparticles within a mzi setup is accompanied by the emission of upstream neutral excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the suppression ( exponential in the temperature @xmath55 , power - law in the voltage @xmath54 ; cf .  </S>",
    "<S> table  [ tbl : visibility ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : visibility ] ) of the ab interference signal . to facilitate the observation of anyonic interferometry one thus needs to resort to small interferometers at low values of @xmath55 and @xmath54 , namely @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the main unknowns here are the velocities : the only available experimental data is for the integer qh regime , with a charge velocity in the @xmath79  cm / sec range @xcite . due to the smaller gap </S>",
    "<S> , fqh charge modes are expected to be slower ; the velocities of the softer neutral modes should be smaller still . taking a typical mzi size of @xmath80  @xmath81 m together with @xmath82  cm / sec , the corresponding voltage and temperature scales </S>",
    "<S> are 0.1  @xmath81v and @xmath83  mk , respectively . hence </S>",
    "<S> , neutral modes should indeed present a significant challenge for current generation mzis . </S>",
    "<S> we are aware , however , of present experimental efforts to reduce the mzi size down to the micron scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would bring the required temperature and voltage to the presently accessible regime . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for the adverse role played by these neutral excitations is that they serve as `` markers '' for specific interference paths , much in the spirit of `` which path '' detection . </S>",
    "<S> this interference suppression mechanism is thus of general validity : it applies to more complex ( multi - mode ) edge structure @xcite , a host of other fractional states featuring upstream neutral modes @xcite , setups supporting nonabelian excitations @xcite , and scenarios with charged upstream modes ( e.g. , clean filling-2/3 edges ) . </S>",
    "<S> allowing for tunneling operators which do not excite the upstream modes ( specifically in our model , charge-@xmath61 tunneling ) will still lead to suppression ( as a high power of the corresponding tunneling amplitude ratio ) of the interference signal due to `` dressing '' by neutral - excitation emitting quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> upstream neutral modes are ubiquitous in the fqh regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they therefore lead to a `` universal '' suppression mechanism of interference signals in the mz geometry for fqh states @xcite .    _ </S>",
