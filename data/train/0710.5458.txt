    "we outline a non - linear @xmath0 model formulation of the disordered single - loop problem which allows us to identify all disorder corrections which exhibit the maximum singularity , and provides an action for spin modes coupled to low - energy diffusive electronic modes , instead of the original electrons .    finally , while all disorder corrections to a single fermion loop lead to couplings which scale at most marginally , impurity lines connecting different fermion loops are a relevant perturbation in @xmath2 . we find that these diagrams may dominate the single - loop contributions below @xmath15 , depending on the typical values of the bosonic momenta .",

    "this singularity is related to the well - known @xmath178 singularity of the particle - hole bubble @xcite ; while in the clean case only a small region of the fermi surface around the hot spots is visited , impurity scattering visits the whole fermi surface , including the parts separated by @xmath178 .",
    "the disorder correction to the fermionic self - energy provides a cutoff for this singularity , thus changing the estimated power of @xmath103 in the expression for @xmath144 .",

    "therefore , @xmath191 is a relevant coupling in @xmath143 and the clean model is unstable against arbitrarily small disorder .",
    "recently , this model has also been studied using a strong - disorder rg @xcite .    however , according to the above discussion the clean afm @xmath185 model is not applicable in @xmath2 because @xmath192 is nonlocal and there are infinitely many additional marginal couplings which even change the direction of the rg flow for @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have pointed out that for a generic fermionic band dispersion the average over a random fermionic potential implies a fluctuating mass term which has non - vanishing higher cumulants @xmath193 . while these higher cumulants are irrelevant in @xmath194 , in two dimensions all couplings @xmath144 are equally relevant and may possibly change the direction of the rg flow also for @xmath195 .",
    "thus , it is not obvious which of the results of @xcite hold in @xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that the fermionic loops with large momentum transfer , which are relevant to describe an afm transition , exhibit two crossover energy scales if disorder corrections are added . in the scaling limit set by charge diffusion @xmath138 , the singularities of the clean ( marginal ) vertices @xmath71 are cut off at scale @xmath196 and the 4-point vertex and beyond become irrelevant . below @xmath177 , however , diffusive ladders lead again to marginal scaling , albeit with a diffusive functional form of the vertex functions different from the clean case . on the other hand , in the scaling limit set by the slower spin diffusion @xmath197 , these crossovers occur at the same momentum scales but at frequency scales smaller by a factor of @xmath103 .",
    "a summary of crossover scales and boundaries is reported in fig .  [",

    "in addition to the single fermion loops , there are diagrams made of multiple fermion loops connected only by impurity lines , which were not present in the clean case . in accordance with",
    "the harris criterion applied to the bare model , these are relevant perturbations in @xmath2 which make the clean model unstable against disorder . indeed , in contrast to @xmath194 , in two dimensions the bosonic model contains infinitely many equally relevant vertices @xmath144 due to disorder corrections to multiple fermion loops , which we estimate to become important below @xmath198 ( charge diffusion ) or @xmath181 ( spin diffusion ) , respectively .    combining these results ,",
    "we can distinguish two cases : if scaling is dominated by charge diffusion , the anomalous clean behavior @xcite above @xmath196 is cut off below to make place for an essentially non - interacting behavior ( hertz - millis theory with only irrelevant couplings ) until @xmath199 , where the relevant disorder vertex @xmath157 starts to dominate .",
    "below @xmath200 , infinitely many more disorder vertices @xmath144 dominate the respective single - loop vertices .    in the case of scaling determined by spin diffusion , the clean anomalous behavior is modified below @xmath196 by a single disorder vertex @xmath157 , while the higher single - loop vertices @xmath201 are not yet strongly modified by disorder . only below @xmath177 the single loops are cut off , but at the same time more disorder vertices @xmath176 appear . in consequence , there is a direct crossover from clean anomalous to strongly disordered behavior which implies that the theory of hertz and millis may not be applicable for the two - dimensional antiferromagnet .",

    "in this appendix we outline the steps to formulate the problem of disordered single loops in terms of the non - linear @xmath0 model for interacting disordered electrons @xcite in order to support the perturbative calculations in this work and control all contributions with the leading singularity . assuming some familiarity with the non - linear @xmath0 model itself , we introduce only the modifications necessary to accommodate the spin - vertex insertions .",
    "we start with noninteracting electrons in the presence of disorder , add the spin vertices as couplings to an external field , perform the disorder average using the replica method , integrate over the fermionic degrees of freedom and obtain an effective action for the @xmath202 matrices ( in standard notation ) , @xmath203 & \\simeq \\int dr    \\left\\ { \\tfrac{\\pi\\rho_0}{8\\tau } \\operatorname{tr}q^2      - \\tfrac 12 \\operatorname{tr}\\ln      \\bigl ( g_0^{-1}+\\tfrac{i}{2\\tau}q-\\phi \\bigr ) \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath202 are matrices in frequency and replica space with a weak real - space dependence representing the electron - hole pairs while @xmath204 is the staggered external field , with the matrix @xmath205 slowly varying in space .. ] the @xmath202 matrices can be expressed as a rotation @xmath206 of the saddle - point solution @xmath207 of the classical action for @xmath208 . in the vicinity of the saddle point ,",

    "one thus obtains vertices @xmath210 which couple the diffusons to the external spin field .",
    "we parametrize the @xmath202 matrices as @xmath211 , where the diffuson propagator @xmath212 is represented by the direct ladder @xmath92 .",
    "there is a term @xmath213 in the action which corresponds to the @xmath110 vertex in equation , and terms @xmath214 and @xmath215 ( corresponding to the @xmath112 vertex ) with two diffusons connected to two spin - vertex insertions .",
    "higher vertices @xmath210 with more than two spin insertions generate sub - leading contributions by the scaling arguments presented below .    for the leading singularity it suffices to consider all possible ways to connect @xmath112 and @xmath110 vertices via diffusons , with the possible inclusion of the hikami vertices @xmath216 @xcite , which represent the interaction of the diffusons in the absence of @xmath205 .",
    "each vertex contributes a @xmath217 function of all momenta , while each ladder implies an integration over its momentum .",
    "hence , the power counting depends only on the number @xmath218 of additional @xmath217 functions beyond the overall @xmath217 function of external momenta , which is the number of vertices minus one , @xmath219 .",
    "the hikami vertices do not contribute to @xmath218 since they scale as an inverse ladder .",
    "the number @xmath49 of spin insertions determines @xmath220 , such that @xmath221 = z - 2n_\\delta = z - 2(n-1)$ ] in accordance with our previous calculation .",

    "[ fig : b2nchain ] and the star - shaped diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : b2ndirty ] .",
    "the class of diagrams with leading singularity contains , however , contributions with a different relative importance measured in powers of @xmath103 . the dominant terms of @xmath222 correspond to a single fermion line and no crossings of direct ladders , otherwise an additional factor @xmath223 is generated according to the formula @xmath224 which is valid for any _ connected _ diagram with @xmath225 hikami vertices @xmath226 and @xmath227 vertices @xmath110 as well as @xmath228 vertices @xmath112 .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig : b4dirty ] corresponds to @xmath229 and has @xmath230 ( with @xmath231 and @xmath232 ) , while an additional ladder crossing the first one corresponds to @xmath233 with a single closed fermion loop which has @xmath234 ( with @xmath235 ) .",
    "if we include the spin propagator in the action and integrate over the diffusons , the purely spin - wave action is recovered with its infinite number of marginal @xmath205 vertices , while integrating over @xmath205 will likely lead to an action with an infinite number of marginal diffuson vertices .",
    "it appears that the action written in terms of both @xmath205 and diffusons provides the simplest formulation of the interaction of the low - energy spin and diffusive modes , with only one ( constant ) coupling associated to the coupling term @xmath236 $ ] .",
    "in this appendix we consider the disorder corrections to the bosonic self - energy beyond the born approximation due to maximally crossed ladders @xmath237 .",
    "in contrast to the direct ladders they can have a diffusive contribution also between two propagators separated by an incommensurate @xmath30 ( e.g. , in the bosonic self - energy ) , and as the ladder momentum is integrated over , this typically results in a logarithm : @xmath238 while the above expression @xmath239 vanishes for @xmath240 , it is logarithmically larger than the landau damping term @xmath241 and has the same sign .",
    "thus , @xmath242 enhances the frequency - dependent part of the bosonic propagator while leaving the momentum - dependent part unchanged for small frequencies and momenta .",
    "therefore , there may be a tendency to increase @xmath88 beyond @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath7 the term in parentheses becomes of @xmath184 , i.e. , comparable with the direct ladder contribution , only if @xmath243 .",
    "as previously mentioned , in this work we discarded these contributions assuming that a small magnetic field would cut off this logarithmic singularity .",
