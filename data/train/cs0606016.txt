    "direct sequence code division multiple - access ( ds - cdma ) has been selected as the fundamental signaling technique for third generation ( 3 g ) wireless communication systems , due to its advantages of soft user capacity limit and inherent frequency diversity .",
    "however , it suffers from multiple - access interference ( mai ) caused by the non - orthogonality of spreading codes , particularly for heavily loaded systems .",
    "therefore , techniques for mitigating the mai , namely multiuser detection , have been the subject of an intensive research effort over the past two decades .",
    "it is well known that multiuser detection can substantially suppress mai , thus improving system performance .",
    "maximum likelihood ( ml ) multiuser detection  @xcite was proposed in the early 1980s , and achieves the optimal performance at the cost of prohibitive computational cost when the number of users is large . for practical implementation , suboptimal algorithms , such as the linear minimum mean square error ( lmmse ) detector @xcite or decorrelator @xcite , allow a tradeoff between complexity and performance .",
    "it should be noted that the technique of multiuser detection is being applied in existing cdma systems , such as ev - do revision a systems @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the turbo principle , namely the iterative exchange of soft information among different blocks in a communication system to improve the system performance , has been applied to combine multiuser detection with channel decoding @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in such turbo multiuser detectors ,",
    "the outputs of channel decoders are fed back to the multiuser detector , thus enhancing the performance iteratively .",
    "turbo multiuser detection based on the maximum _ a posteriori _ probability ( map ) detection and decoding criterion has been proposed in @xcite@xcite together with a lower complexity technique based on interference cancellation and lmmse filtering .",
    "further simplification is obtained by applying parallel interference cancellation ( pic )  @xcite for multiuser detection , where the decisions of the decoders are directly subtracted from the original signal to cancel the mai .",
    "practical wireless communication systems usually experience fading channels , whose state information is unknown to the receiver .",
    "thus practical systems need to consider detection and decoding with uncertain channel state information . in the context of short code cdma systems ,",
    "blind multiuser detection can be accomplished without explicit channel estimation by using subspace and other techniques @xcite .",
    "an alternative receiver structure adopts an explicit channel estimation block and carries out the decoding with the corresponding channel estimate . in systems without decision feedback ,",
    "the channel estimation block is cascaded with the decoder and operates as a front end for the subsequent blocks . with such a receiver structure ,",
    "the channel estimates can be obtained with training symbols  @xcite or with blind estimation algorithms  @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for the performance of such channel estimation schemes are given in  @xcite and the corresponding impact on multiuser detection is discussed in the large system limit in @xcite and  @xcite . in systems with decision feedback , the decisions of the decoder are fed back to the channel estimator to enhance its performance . in such systems , the channel estimator and",
    "the decoder can operate either simultaneously  @xcite or successively  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "an example of the former strategy applied to ml sequence detection in uncertain environments is proposed in  @xcite ; called per - survivor processing , tentative decisions are immediately fed back to the channel estimation algorithm and the corresponding estimates are used for the detection of future symbols . in the latter strategy , the decisions are fed back only when the entire current decoding procedure is finished .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , an expectation maximization ( em ) channel estimation algorithm , combined with successive interference cancellation , is proposed .",
    "joint channel estimation and data detection algorithms for uncoded single - antenna and multiple - antenna systems are discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively . in channel coded systems , iteration can achieve better performance when the turbo principle is applied , due to the redundancy introduced by the code structure . in  @xcite ,",
    "an iterative algorithm is proposed and analyzed for channel estimation and decoding of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) coded quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) systems .    in this paper",
    ", we consider channel - coded cdma systems operating over multipath fading channels whose channel state information is unknown to the receiver .",
    "to demodulate and decode such systems , we apply the turbo principle to both channel estimation and multiuser detection . as shown in figure 1",
    ", we consider a receiver that feeds back decisions from channel decoders to both an ml channel estimator and a pic multiuser detector .",
    "the iteration is initialized with training symbol based channel estimation and a non - iterative multiuser detection .",
    "the receiver structure is similar to those proposed in @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "however , this paper is focused mainly on the performance analysis of such structures using semi - analytic methods .",
    "we analyze the contributions to the variance of the channel estimation error due to noise and decision feedback error , and the variance of the residual mai after pic .",
    "we then use this analysis to describe the decoding process as an iterative mapping .",
    "we also propose conditions assuring convergence of this iterative mapping to a unique fixed point .",
    "we further compute the asymptotic multiuser efficiency ( ame )  @xcite of this overall system , under some mild assumptions on the channel decoders .",
    "it should be noted that the analysis in this paper is based on large sample and large system analysis .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the signal model and the channel decoder used in our analysis .",
    "the performance analyses of ml channel estimation and pic multiuser detection are given in section iii and section iv , respectively .",
    "based on these results , the corresponding iterative mapping is described and analyzed in section v. numerical results and conclusions are given in section vi and section vii , respectively .",

    "we consider a synchronous uplink long code ( aperiodic ) ds - cdma system , with identical channel coding , binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) modulation , @xmath16 active users , spreading gain @xmath17 , system load @xmath18 , and identical transmission rates for all users .",
    "the transmitted symbols experience multipath fading .",
    "we adopt a block fading model and denote by @xmath19 the coherence time , measured in the number of symbol periods , over which the channel is stationary . within a coherence period , the chip matched filter output of the receiver at symbol period @xmath20",

    "circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg)noise variables with ( normalized ) variance @xmath30 .",
    "it should be noted that although the assumption of synchronicity is valid in time division duplexing ( tdd ) systems , it does not hold for many frequency division duplexing ( fdd ) systems .",
    "however , as it will be shown , the results from the analysis of synchronous systems are also reasonably valid , though not exactly the same , in the case of asynchronous systems .    for the system model",
    ", we have the following assumptions .    [ assum1 ] the channel gains @xmath31 are independently cscg distributed with zero means and variances @xmath32 .",
    "we consider only the case of large @xmath22 , which implies that @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; thus all users achieve the same performance with maximal ratio combining ( mrc ) .",

    "the above assumptions simplify the performance analysis substantially .",
    "moreover , these assumptions are reasonable for practical systems due to the following reasons :    * assumption [ assum1 ] is based on the fact that more propagation paths are resolvable in cdma systems than narrow band systems , particularly in environments with abundant scattering ( e.g. , indoor environment ) . with this assumption",
    ", we ignore the impact of the fluctuation of received power incurred by the multipath fading , and consider only the impairment caused by the channel estimation error . *",
    "assumption [ assum2 ] is unrealistic since these sequences are shifted versions of each other ( _ shifted model _ ) .",
    "however , the accuracy of the results dependent upon this assumption is validated with numerical results in section vi and asymptotic analysis given in appendix 1 .",
    "the structure of receiver is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the channel coefficients are estimated in the channel estimator , which operates in a ` semi - blind ' way .",
    "training symbols are available to obtain an initial estimate in the first iteration . in the further iterations",
    "the information symbol decisions from channel decoders are assumed to be correct .",
    "then , both the training symbols and fed back decisions are considered as training symbols and used for ml channel estimation . a multiuser detector is used to mitigate the mai and its outputs are de - interleaved and decoded in the channel decoder . in the multiuser detector ,",
    "we use the lmmse algorithm in the first iteration and the pic algorithm with the aid of hard decision feedback in the succeeding iterations .",
    "we follow the standard procedure in turbo multiuser detection @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite to reconstruct the channel symbols from the channel decoder output",
    ". then these channel symbol estimates are interleaved and fed back to the multiuser detector and channel estimator to enhance the performance iteratively .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 the estimated binary channel symbol of user @xmath26 at symbol period @xmath20 that is fed back from the channel decoder . for simplicity ,",
    "we use hard decision feedback and denote the feedback symbol error rate by @xmath43 .",
    "the decision feedback error is denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "supposing that both @xmath23 and @xmath45 are symmetrically distributed , it is easy to check that    * @xmath46 ; * @xmath47 ; * @xmath48 . * @xmath49 , when @xmath50 .    it should be noted that , in practical systems , soft decision feedback will achieve better performance than hard decision feedback .",
    "however , the performance of channel estimation with soft decision feedback is determined by both the first and second moments of the decision feedback error  @xcite .",
    "thus the corresponding analysis of performance evolution is more complicated than the case of hard decision feedback .",
    "therefore , we adopt hard decision feedback in order to simplify the system performance analysis .    for the decision feedback from channel decoders",
    ", we have the following reasonable assumption , which simplifies the analysis and is also used in @xcite .",
    "[ assum4 ] the codeword length is assumed to be large enough so that the transmitted symbols are coded over many coherence periods . the decision feedbacks @xmath51 are mutually independent for different @xmath26 or @xmath20 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the performance of channel estimation .",
    "first , we explain the training symbol based ml channel estimation algorithm that is used in the first iteration .",
    "then , we consider the estimation of the channel coefficients with only hard decision feedback from the channel decoders . finally , we extend the performance results to channel estimation with both training symbols and decision feedback , the latter of which is used in the further iterations .    in applying the turbo principle , to avoid the reuse of information , only observations @xmath52 are used in the channel estimation for multiuser detection in symbol period @xmath10 .",
    "thus the corresponding channel estimation error is independent of @xmath53 .",
    "however , for simplicity of discussion , we still assume that all @xmath19 received signals are used for the channel estimation while retaining this independence assumption . for large @xmath19 , this results in only a small error in the analysis .    in the following discussion of channel estimation and pic ,",
    "we regard the channel gains @xmath54 and the spreading codes @xmath55 as realizations of random variables . only the transmitted symbols , decision feedback errors and noise",
    "are considered as random variables . throughout this paper ,",
    "all expectations , denoted as @xmath56 , are over the distributions of these three variables .",
    "thus our results are conditioned on the realizations of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "however , by the strong law of large numbers , we will see that we can obtain identical results for almost every realization of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the large system limit ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "first we assume that there are @xmath19 training symbols , channel symbols known to the receiver , within a single coherence period .",
    "for simplicity in deriving the channel estimate , we stack the chip matched filter output of the signal corresponding to these training symbols , rewriting ( [ signalmodel ] ) as @xmath58 where @xmath59    applying the ml criterion and the normality of the noise , we can obtain the ml channel estimate , which is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "it follows directly that the channel estimation error is @xmath63 from which it is obvious that this error has zero mean and covariance @xmath64 .    for a finite @xmath19 ,",
    "we can compute @xmath65 in the large system limit ( i.e. when @xmath57 while keeping the system load , @xmath66 , constant ) . for a system with system load @xmath67",
    ", it is well known that as @xmath68 , @xmath69 converges to the multiuser efficiency of a decorrelator , namely @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "@xmath71 is equivalent to the covariance matrix of a system with equivalent system load @xmath72 .",
    "thus as @xmath57 , we have @xmath73 therefore , for sufficiently large @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the variance of channel estimation error is given by @xmath74 which can be approximated by @xmath75 when @xmath19 is sufficiently large .",
    "it should be noted that , in asynchronous systems , we can remove part of the chips in the first and the last symbol periods to obtain a similar matrix @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the largest time offsets of different users , measured in chips .",
    "since the training symbols have been incorporated into the spreading codes , we can consider the columns of @xmath78 as random @xmath79 vectors , regardless of the time offsets of different users .",
    "therefore , the variance of channel estimation error in asynchronous systems is similar to that of synchronous systems when @xmath19 is sufficiently large .        when decision feedback is used in place of training symbols to derive the ` ml ' channel estimates , a process that assumes that the decision feedback is free of error , the channel estimation error is caused by both the thermal noise and the decision feedback error .",
    "on applying ( [ mlestimation ] ) , the channel estimate with decision feedback is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the version of @xmath85 in ( [ mlestimation ] ) obtained from the decision feedback , which is given by @xmath86    hence , the channel estimation error can be decomposed into two parts @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 denote the channel estimation error due to the decision feedback error and the thermal noise , respectively .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are mutually independent .",
    "( recall our assumption concerning the use of only measurements @xmath92 in estimating gains at time @xmath10 . )",
    "it is difficult to tackle the calculation of @xmath93 due to the matrix inversion @xmath94 .",
    "however , we can approximate @xmath94 by @xmath95 when @xmath43 is sufficiently small .",
    "this approximation is justified by the following lemma .",
    "when fixing @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we have @xmath96 almost surely as @xmath97 and @xmath98 .    according to the definition of @xmath99 , we have@xmath100 where @xmath101 .",

    "@xmath103 which tends to 0 as @xmath98 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath104 as @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , @xmath94 converges to @xmath105 almost surely as @xmath106 .    applying the strong law of large numbers and the fact that the diagonal elements in @xmath107 are @xmath19 and the off - diagonal elements in @xmath108 are independent for different values of @xmath109 and have zero mean",
    ", we obtain that , while keeping @xmath16 and @xmath17 fixed , @xmath110 almost surely , as @xmath97 .",
    "since the elements of @xmath105 are continuous functions of those in @xmath111 in a neighborhood of @xmath112 , we also have @xmath113 as @xmath97 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "therefore , we can further approximate @xmath114 by @xmath95 for large @xmath19 and small @xmath43 . for simplicity",
    ", our further discussion of @xmath115 will be based on this approximation , which will be validated by numerical results .",
    "consequently , in the following discussions , we use the approximations @xmath116 and @xmath117      we denote the covariance matrices of @xmath118 , @xmath115 and @xmath119 by @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively , which satisfy @xmath123 .",
    "we first consider the channel estimation error incurred by decision feedback errors .",
    "the following lemma shows that the channel estimation error @xmath115 is asymptotically biased .",
    "the proof is given in appendix ii .",
    "[ lem_mean_a_f ] when keeping @xmath16 and @xmath17 fixed , we have @xmath124 almost surely , as @xmath97 .    it should be noted that this bias can not be removed _ a priori _ in the estimator since it is dependent on the channel gain , @xmath125 . however , this bias vanishes as @xmath98 .    an asymptotic expression for the elements in @xmath121 is given in the following proposition , whose proof is given in appendix iii , where we also explain that the conclusion also applies to asynchronous case when @xmath43 is sufficiently small .    [ lemma_cov_f ] for all @xmath10 and @xmath11 , when fixing @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we have that ( recall that @xmath24 is the channel gain of use @xmath26 and path @xmath25 ) @xmath126 almost surely , as @xmath97 .    for @xmath119 , which is caused by thermal noise , the corresponding analysis is identical to that of training symbol based estimation .",
    "then , we have @xmath127 almost surely , as @xmath128",
    ". then the covariance matrix of channel estimation error @xmath129 can be obtained from ( [ cov_delta_a_f ] ) and ( [ cov_delta_a_n ] ) .",
    "the variance of channel estimation error can be obtained as a corollary of the previous subsection .    on defining @xmath130 , we have @xmath131 almost surely , as @xmath132 .",
    "thus , when @xmath133 are sufficiently large , we have the following approximation @xmath134    it should be noted that the channel estimation error can not be removed by increasing @xmath19 although the variance vanishes as @xmath97 , since the estimate is biased and the bias can not be removed _ a priori_.      we denote the number of training symbols by @xmath135 and the corresponding percentage by @xmath136 .",
    "when the training symbols and decision feedback are combined for channel estimation , the performance is determined by ( [ delta_a ] ) , with @xmath43 replaced by @xmath137 .",
    "decision feedback should only be used along with the training symbols if the resulting variance is smaller than that obtained when only the training symbols are used . then it is easy to check that , when @xmath19 and @xmath135 are sufficiently large , @xmath138 , the maximum @xmath43 assuring performance improvement when decision feedback is used , is determined by @xmath139 which results in @xmath140 from which we observe that @xmath138 decreases with @xmath141 and @xmath67 while increasing with @xmath30 and @xmath22 .",
    "for convenience of analysis , the performance of pic is analyzed based on matched filter ( mf ) outputs .",
    "we drop the index of the symbol period for notational simplicity throughout this section . for a given symbol period ,",

    "it is obvious that @xmath146 . and the corresponding variance is given by @xmath147 as @xmath57 , where we have applied the fact that @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath151 is identical for asynchronous systems since different time offsets do not affect the interference power .",
    "it is difficult to apply the central limit theorem to show the asymptotic normality of the pic output since the variables @xmath152 are mutually correlated across different users and paths .",
    "however , numerical results in section vi will show that the output distribution of pic can be well approximated by a gaussian distribution .",
    "thus , in the subsequent sections , we assume that the output of pic is gaussian distributed .    according to the properties of the crosscorrelation given in section ii.a , @xmath153 almost surely , as @xmath154 .",
    "thus , for large spreading gain , the interference across different paths of the same user can be ignored . with the normality assumption of the residual mai",
    ", it is easy to show that the variables @xmath155 are mutually independent as @xmath154 , which means that channel coded symbol @xmath156 is transmitted through @xmath22 independent channels .",
    "this assumption simplifies the analysis although it does not hold exactly when @xmath17 is finite .",
    "thus , we use mrc to collect these @xmath22 replicas , resulting in the output @xmath157    applying lemma [ lem_mean_a_f ] , we obtain that , as @xmath158 , @xmath159    moreover , we can obtain that , as @xmath158 @xmath160    therefore , when @xmath19 and @xmath22 are sufficiently large , ( [ picoutput ] ) can be approximated by @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a cscg random variable with variance of @xmath163 .",

    "in this section , we analyze the overall iterative system shown in figure 1 .",
    "we consider only the case of small @xmath43 , moderate @xmath30 and moderate @xmath19 and note that the analytic results become more precise as @xmath43 and @xmath30 decrease and @xmath19 increases .",
    "this configuration is reasonable for the decision feedback based systems since if @xmath19 is large , training symbol based channel estimation can be adopted with marginal loss of spectral efficiency ; if @xmath19 is small , it is difficult to carry out coherent detection ; and if @xmath43 is large , the iteration diverges .",

    "it is obvious that @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "the asymptotic multiuser efficiency is given by @xmath215 if @xmath216 , then @xmath210 is the unique solution of @xmath217 . applying the assumptions that @xmath169 and @xmath213",
    ", we have @xmath218 thus @xmath219 from ( [ ame ] ) , we can see that the loss of ame is due to the channel estimation error incurred by the thermal noise .",
    "the impact of the decision feedback error vanishes as @xmath220 , while that of the channel estimation error remains .",
    "the main computational cost of the iterative channel estimation and multiuser detection includes :    * solving the linear equation @xmath221 for ml channel estimation . * reconstructing the channel symbols and cancelling the interference . *",
    "channel decoding .",
    "since the channel symbol reconstruction is similar to the encoding procedure and the interference cancelation requires only subtractions , this is not a bottleneck of the whole procedure and the corresponding computational cost is of complexity @xmath222 .",
    "real - time channel decoding can also be accomplished in a way similar to turbo codes .",
    "therefore , the main bottleneck is solving the linear equation for channel estimation .",
    "direct gaussian eliminatation , which is of complexity @xmath223 , can be applied to solve the equation @xmath221 when @xmath16 is small . when @xmath16 is large , iterative techniques of solving linear equations , such as the jacobi method and the gauss - seidel method , can be applied . for assuring the convergence , we cite the following lemma from @xcite :    the sufficient and necessary condition for the convergence of iterations in solving the linear equation @xmath224 is that    * @xmath15 and @xmath225 are both positive definite in the jacobi method denotes a diagonal matrix constituted by the diagonal elements in matrix @xmath226 ; * @xmath15 is positive definite in the gauss - seidel method .",
    "the gauss - seidel method always converges when @xmath227 since @xmath99 is positive definite when @xmath228 .",
    "for the jacobi method , it is easy to check that @xmath229 .",
    "since the largest eigenvalue of @xmath99 converges to @xmath230 @xcite almost surely as @xmath57 , the eigenvalues in @xmath231 are less than @xmath232 almost surely in the large system limit .",
    "therefore , @xmath233 is a sufficient condition for the almost sure convergence of jacobi iteration in the large system limit .",
    "then , when @xmath16 and @xmath17 are sufficiently large and @xmath228 , we can use either gauss - seidel or jacobi iterations to estimate the channel coefficients efficiently .",
    "figure 2 shows the average variance of the channel estimates versus the coherence time @xmath19 with the configuration of @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 and the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr)@xmath238db and snr are not mutually independent ; however , we set these two parameters arbitrarily to test the validity of asymptotic results . ] .",
    "the asymptotic results obtained from ( [ delta_a ] ) and the simulation results for finite systems ( @xmath239 ) with spreading codes for the shifted model are represented by solid and dotted curves , respectively . in this figure , the estimation error variance caused by decision feedback and noise are denoted by @xmath240 and @xmath241 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding asymptotic results are obtained from the first and the second terms in ( [ delta_a ] ) , respectively .",
    "we can observe that the asymptotic results match the simulation results well even when @xmath19 is small .",
    "this figure also demonstrates the validity of results based on the independence assumption of the spreading codes given in section ii.a .",
    "figure 3 shows the channel symbol error rate with the configuration of @xmath242db , @xmath243 and @xmath237 and @xmath244 .",
    "the solid curves represent the results obtained from numerical simulations and the dashed curves represent the results with the assumption that the output of pic is cscg distributed .",
    "the gap between the numerical results and cscg based prediction is small , thus justifying the normality assumption of the pic output .",
    "we define the user capacity to be the maximum system load @xmath245 with which the system can achieve the information bit error rate of @xmath246 .",
    "two types of channel codes , the convolutional code @xmath247 and a turbo code ( with two constituent codes @xmath248 ) , with bit rate @xmath249 and codeword length 1024 are used in this paper and their error rates for both information bits and extrinsic information based channel symbols are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath245 s for various values of coherence time @xmath19 , denoted by ` iterative ' , are given in figure 5 and figure 6 for convolutional codes and turbo codes , respectively , with the configuration @xmath250 , snr@xmath238db and @xmath235 .",
    "the @xmath245 s of the non - iterative lmmse detector , denoted by ` lmmse ' , are given for comparison .",
    "we can see that the iterative system achieves substantially higher user capacity than the non - iterative one .",
    "the performance of systems with ideal initialization , where actual channel parameters are provided by a genie in the initialization stage , denoted by ` perfect initialization ' , implies that a good initialization can improve the performance considerably .",
    "thus , blind or semi - blind non - iterative techniques , which make use of information symbols , can be applied to obtain a better initialization . for comparison ,",
    "the user capacities of both iterative and non - iterative systems with perfect channel state information are also given in both figures .",
    "an interesting observation is that the relative performance gain of iterative systems over the non - iterative ones is smaller for turbo codes than for convolutional codes .",
    "this is due to the steeper waterfall region in turbo codes .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the performance of decision feedback based iterative channel estimation and multiuser detection in multipath ds - cdma channels .",
    "the decoding process has been described as an iterative mapping in terms of the variance of the channel decoder output , and conditions assuring the convergence and uniqueness of a fixed point have been proposed .",
    "numerical results show that the initialization is important to the iterations , thus necessitating the use of non - iterative blind or semi - blind channel estimation algorithms for initialization purposes .",
    "another observation of interest is that the gain of the iterative process over a non - iterative one is small when a near - optimal channel coding scheme is used .",
    "in ( 1 ) , for different values of @xmath25 and @xmath109 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 are generated by the same binary sequence with different offsets .",
    "our purpose is to show that if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are large enough , we can regard the shifted spreading codes of different paths of a given user as independent sequences .",
    "the properties based on this assumption , which are used for the system performance analysis in this paper , include :    * the properties of crosscorrelation @xmath253 in section ii.a . * the distribution of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath254 , when developing the expression of @xmath241 for finite @xmath19 and large @xmath16 in section iii.c .",
    "our assumption means that the corresponding distribution of the shifted model is asymptotically identical to that of the independent model .",
    "it is easy to check the first item using the symmetry of the binary distribution .",
    "however , the validity of the second one is non - trivial and is of considerable importance when applying the theory of large random matrices to multipath fading channels",
    ". we can tackle this problem by showing that the moments of the eigenvalues in both models are the same via the following lemma .",
    "denote a generic eigenvalue of @xmath254 by @xmath255 .",
    "then the @xmath109-th moment of @xmath255 in the shifted model is given by @xmath256 which is the same expression of that of the independent model , and where the definition of @xmath257 is given in  @xcite and @xmath258 .",
    "using similar arguments to those in  @xcite , we have @xmath259 where @xmath260 .    for any @xmath261 ,",
    "@xmath262 when @xmath263 and @xmath264 equals the offset difference between these two shifted sequences .",
    "however , the probability of such events vanishes as @xmath265 since @xmath266 thus , as @xmath265 , the term involving @xmath267 s of different users , which are mutually independent , dominates the summation in ( [ expecteigvalue ] ) .",
    "the remaining part of the proof is the same as in  @xcite .",
    "the following lemma ( theorem 30.1 in  @xcite ) provides a sufficient condition for the equality of two probability measures when their moments are identical .",
    "let @xmath268 be a probability measure on the real line having finite moments @xmath269 of all orders . if the power series @xmath270 has a positive radius of convergence , then @xmath268 is the only probability measure with the moments @xmath271 .    for applying lemma i.2 , we need the following lemma which provides an upper bound for the moments of the eigenvalues .    for any eigenvalue @xmath255 of @xmath254 ,",
    "there exists a constant @xmath272 such that for @xmath273 @xmath274    the result follows by induction on @xmath109 .",
    "it is easy to verify that ( [ ieqeigenexp ] ) holds when @xmath275 .",
    "suppose @xmath276 , for @xmath277 .",
    "use the following recursive formula  @xcite to evaluate @xmath278 , which is given by @xmath279    then we have @xmath280 where the first inequality is based the assumption on @xmath281 and the fact that @xmath282 ; the third inequality applies the condition that @xmath272 and @xmath283 for @xmath284 .",
    "this concludes the proof .    applying stirling s formula and lemmas i.1,2,3",
    ", we can obtain the conclusion that the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath254 in the shifted model is identical to that of the independent model , thus assuring the assumption that the columns of @xmath78 can be regarded as independent in the large system limit .",
    "from the definition of @xmath285 , we have @xmath286    we consider the term @xmath287 first .",
    "it is easy to check that ( recall that @xmath251 denotes the spreading code of user @xmath26 along path @xmath25 ) @xmath288 where @xmath289 , @xmath290 , @xmath291 , @xmath292 .",
    "it should be noted we applied the fact that @xmath293 in the second equality .    according to assumption [ assum3 ] , the spread codes are mutually independent for different users or different paths .",
    "thus , by applying the strong law of large numbers , we have @xmath294    therefore , we have @xmath295    similarly , we can show that @xmath296    this completes the proof .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath297 is given by @xmath298    the elements in @xmath299 are given by @xmath300 where @xmath301 , namely the spreading code ( incorporating the channel symbol ) of the @xmath302-th path of user @xmath303 at symbol period @xmath304 , @xmath305 and @xmath306 is the @xmath26-th element of vector @xmath125 and equals @xmath307 .",
    "to compute the corresponding expectation , we apply the following properties , which are based on assumption [ assum4 ] :    * when @xmath308 , if @xmath309 , @xmath310 , since @xmath311 and @xmath312 are determined by the same decision feedback ; * when @xmath308 , if @xmath313 , @xmath314 , since @xmath311 and @xmath312 are determined by decision feedback from different users ; * when @xmath315 , @xmath314 , since @xmath311 and @xmath312 are determined by decision feedback from different symbol periods ; * when @xmath316 , @xmath317 .      applying the strong law of large numbers and the assumption on the spreading codes that @xmath324 are independent for different values of @xmath10 or @xmath304",
    ", we can obtain that , as @xmath97 , the following conclusions hold almost surely : @xmath325    we can apply the same manipulation and obtain that @xmath326 as @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , we can obtain ( [ cov_delta_a_f ] ) since the sum of the middle three terms in ( [ cov_f ] ) is zero and @xmath323 cancels @xmath327 .",
    "it should be noted that the above analysis is also valid for asynchronous case when @xmath43 is sufficiently small .",
    "similar to the discussion in section iii.a , we can remove part of the chips in the first and the last symbol periods to obtain a similar matrix @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the largest time offsets of different users , measured in chips .",
    "when @xmath43 is sufficiently small and @xmath19 is sufficiently large , we can ignore the terms scaled by @xmath328 and the edge effect in the first and last symbol period .",
    "then , we have @xmath329 where @xmath330 is the @xmath26-th column of matrix @xmath78 , which converges to @xmath321 as @xmath97",
