    "the formation mechanism of brown dwarfs ( bds , mass @xmath4 ) is one of the highly debated unsolved problems because the typical jeans mass in molecular clouds is too large to form these substellar mass objects @xcite .",
    "three mechanisms have been proposed : ( 1 ) in a molecular cloud , a fraction of cores with bd mass may be compressed by the turbulent flow to reach sufficient high densities for the gravitational collapse to proceed @xcite .",
    "oph - b11 was identified by @xcite as a _ pre - brown dwarf _ , namely a starless core that will likely form a bd in the future , suggesting this mechanism is a possible way to form a bd .",
    "this scenario is also supported by other works with identifications of bd candidates at early evolutionary stages @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) bds are also considered to form in massive disks or multiple systems and be ejected later @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the third mechanism suggests that bds form near massive stars which drive strong winds to disrupt the envelopes of bds before they can accrete sufficient material to form stars @xcite . identifying the formation mechanism(s ) requires to study the early stage when a bd is still deeply embedded in its parental core , i.e. , at the _  proto - brown dwarf \" _",

    "several vellos were considered to be proto - bd candidates in previous studies .",
    "@xcite identified a proto - bd , j041757 , in the taurus molecular cloud based on the low luminosity and mass derived from its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the low mass accretion rate of l328-irs calculated from its outflows suggests that l328-irs would attain at most a mass of 0.05 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived an unusually low density toward the natal core of l1148-irs , implying it could be a good bd candidate .",
    "@xcite found that ic 348-smm2e will most likely remain substellar based on its low outflow force and low bolometric luminosity . as a result",
    ", vellos could be some of the best targets for studying bds in the embedded phase .",
    "iras162532429 ( hereafter iras16253 ) was first discovered as a class 0 source by @xcite in the @xmath9 oph star forming region ( d=125 pc , evans et al .",
    "later , @xcite classified it as a vello with an internal luminosity of @xmath20.080.09 @xmath7 .",
    "iras16253 is located in a relatively isolated and quiescent portion in the east of the l1688 protocluster in the ophiuchus molecular cloud complex .",
    "thus it can be used for testing whether a bd can form in the same manner as a hydrogen - burning star .",
    "@xcite suggested that the central mass of iras16253 is less than 0.1 @xmath8 by studying the kinematic structure of the parent core through n@xmath1h@xmath10 observations with the combined array for research in millimeterwave astronomy ( carma ) .",
    "@xcite also estimated the mass of the central star to be 0.020.04 @xmath8 using a kinematic model for a relatively small - scale c@xmath11o emission using the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "in addition , iras16253 is believed to host a binary system based on the precessing h@xmath1 jet detected by @xcite ( see section [ sec : pre ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the mass of each component in the binary system is even lower . to determine whether iras16253 is a proto - bd binary system or not , we need to measure the masses of the protostellar objects accurately and derive the mass accretion from the parent core",
    "it is difficult to determine the mass of the central star of a young stellar object ( yso ) especially at the embedded phase .",
    "one can fit the sed to obtain the photospheric luminosity and the effective temperature of the protostar and estimate the mass by comparing the value to evolutionary tracks @xcite .",
    "however , one sed may be reproduced by several sets of parameters @xcite and the resulting mass is model dependent .",
    "recently , the central mass of ysos has been obtained with high angular resolution interferometric observations from kinematic models by assuming a keplerian rotation in the disk or envelope @xcite .",
    "the keplerian rotation is however difficult to detect in very low - mass objects like proto - bds ; for example , both @xcite and @xcite did not find significant velocity gradients in iras16253 .",
    "the most reliable mass estimation is resolving a binary rotation motion , which is mostly performed in pre - main sequence stars while the binary rotation is difficult to probe at the embedded phase . in this study",
    ", we trace the binary orbital motion through the protostellar jets / outflows driven by iras16253 and derive the mass of the central stars in order to identify iras16253 as a proto - bd binary system .    wiggling patterns of jets / outflows",
    "are used to probe the dynamics of binary systems .",
    "this method has been applied toward several protostars ( iras 20126@xmath124104 , shepherd et al .",

    "wiggling patterns are believed to originate from ( 1 ) the orbital motion of the driving source or ( 2 ) the precession of the accretion disk caused by tidal interactions in a noncoplanar binary system .",
    "both interpretations require the existence of a binary system , and the two origins can be distinguished by mirror - symmetric ( orbital ) or point - symmetric ( precession ) locus in both position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams and images @xcite .",
    "the jet wiggling pattern caused by the orbital motion enables us to derive the orbital period , velocity , and binary separation , which allows us to determine the masses of the central stars .    in iras16253 ,",
    "a s - shaped ( point - symmetric ) h@xmath1 jet was detected at 2.12 @xmath13 m by @xcite and in the mid - infrared by @xcite , but the spectral resolution was too low to probe the dynamics of the central stars .",
    "@xcite used the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) to map the large - scale co ( 32 ) emission from the outflows .",
    "however , the low - j co emission is offset from the collimated h@xmath1 jet , suggesting that they trace different gas .",
    "in addition , the low - j transitions suffer from optical depth effects , resulting in an underestimate of the outflow mass as well as the outflow force @xcite . @xcite",
    "further found that the molecular cloud and/or core emission could hide the outflows in low velocity regions , which makes the estimation more uncertain .    in this paper , we analyse multi - transition co observations obtained with single - dish telescopes ( co 21 with the iram 30 m telescope , co 65/76 with apex ) , and an interferometer ( co 21 with the sma )",

    "mid - j co ( j = 65 and 76 ) emission traces the warm gas in protostellar outflows @xcite and is less affected by the above mentioned issues @xcite , which allows us to extract the outflow in low velocity regions and to accurately determine the outflow mass and force .",
    "we observed iras16253 using the submillimeter array ( sma ) in the compact configuration in april 2013 .",

    "the pointing and focus were checked every @xmath21.5 hours and the pointing accuracy was found to be better than 1 .",

    "a point source was detected by jvla at the position of the infrared source with a peak intensity of @xmath20.12 mjy beam@xmath15 .",
    "the binary system is also not resolved by the jvla observations with an angular resolution of @xmath19 , implying that the separation is extremely small . however , another possibility is that the companion is too faint to detect at 43 ghz since the s / n ratio of the detected point source is only @xmath25.9 .",

    "the true distance could be larger than the projected distance if the c@xmath11o and n@xmath1d@xmath10 emission comes from a flattened structure perpendicular to the outflow axis which is expected to lie close to the plane of the sky due to the collimated extended emission .",
    "the systemic velocities are found to be @xmath31 km s@xmath15 for the c@xmath11o emission and @xmath32 km s@xmath15 for the n@xmath1d@xmath10 emission from hyperfine structure fitting , although the fitting result of c@xmath11o may be affected by its slightly asymmetric line profile that is skewed to the blue .",
    "the sma co ( 21 ) integrated intensity map reveals two collimated components ( figure [ fig : smaco ] ) .",
    "both components contain blue - shifted emission and red - shifted emission which are likely bipolar jets / outflows from the central submillimeter source .",
    "one component lies along the north - east south - west direction ( hereafter ne - sw ) , and the other is approximately along the north south direction ( hereafter n - s ) in the plane of the sky .",
    "each of them could trace either an outflow cavity wall or a jet . via scattered light",
    ", the outflow cavity is clearly seen in the irac 1 image ( figures [ fig : sma ] and [ fig : smaco ] ) and exhibits a bipolar , symmetric , hourglass shape @xcite .",
    "the n@xmath1h@xmath10 ( 10 ) emission likely highlights the dense region carved by the bipolar outflows .",
    "it is not seen toward the outflow cavity , especially on the side of the blue - shifted lobe . for the red - shifted lobe , the n@xmath1h@xmath10 emission partially overlaps with the cavity , which may be explained by projection effect ;",
    "some n@xmath1h@xmath10 might be distributed in front of the outflow cavity .",
    "the ne - sw co ( 21 ) component is well separated from the edges of the outflow cavity traced by the near - infrared scattered light at 3.6 @xmath13 m ( figure [ fig : smaco]a ) .",
    "in addition , the ne - sw component matches well the h@xmath1 emission ( figure [ fig : smaco]b , the h@xmath1 image is obtained from the cfht observations by t. hsieh et al .",
    "2016 in preparation ) which exhibits a distinct s - shaped pattern and clearly does not follow the cavity edge @xcite ; the co emission continuously extends from the central source to the h@xmath1 emission whereas the h@xmath1 emission is detected in three isolated patches .",
    "the southernmost h@xmath1 patch in figure [ fig : sin ] does not have associated sma co emission , because it is outside the field of view of our sma observations . as a result , the ne - sw co ( 21 ) component is most likely associated to the h@xmath1 jet rather than to the wall of the outflow cavity .",
    "the n - s co ( 21 ) component is detected toward iras16253 for the first time .",
    "like the ne - sw component , the n - s component is not distributed along the edge of the outflow seen in the irac 1 image .",
    "this suggests that the n - s component traces another jet , even if there is no h@xmath1 emission associated with it .",
    "the loci of both ne - sw and n - s components are curved and likely have a point symmetry at the source center .",
    "we hereafter call these two components ne - sw jet and n - s jet .      the co ( 21 ) , ( 65 ) , and ( 76 )",
    "integrated intensity maps are shown in figure [ fig : sca ] . for a better comparison ,",
    "the co ( 65 ) and ( 76 ) maps were smoothed to the angular resolution of the co ( 21 ) map ( 112 ) , and all the maps were constructed in the same grid with a pixel size of 5 . because the co emission traces both the outflows and the large - scale structures of the molecular cloud , we applied a multiresolution analysis @xcite to the channel maps in order to remove the cloud emission ( see section [ sec : sca ] ) .",
    "figures [ fig : sin ] and [ fig : sca ] to [ fig : apexch1bsmo ] show the integrated intensity and channel maps after filtering the large - scale emission produced by the molecular cloud .        the molecular outflows detected in co ( 21 ) and ( 65 ) are extended up to @xmath22 - 3  ( 1500023000  au ) from the source center .",
    "for both co ( 21 ) and ( 65 ) , the blue - shifted outflows are much weaker than the red - shifted outflows . however , the spatial and velocity distributions are very different between co ( 21 ) and ( 65 ) as shown in the integrated intensity maps ( figure [ fig : sin ] ) and channel maps ( figures [ fig : iramch1 ] and [ fig : apexch1 ] ) .",
    "the co ( 65 ) emission tends to be stronger than co ( 21 ) at low velocity ; co ( 65 ) is much brighter in the velocity ranges of @xmath223.5 km s@xmath15 ( blue - shifted ) and @xmath24.46.4 km s@xmath15 ( red - shifted ) , while co ( 21 ) is brighter in the velocity ranges of @xmath20.92.6 km s@xmath15 ( blue - shifted ) and @xmath24.77.1 km s@xmath15 ( red - shifted ) . besides , in the low velocity range of @xmath24.75.0 km s@xmath15 , co ( 21 ) is undetected in the inner regions where the co ( 65 ) emission is bright . for the blue - shifted outflow lobe , the co ( 65 ) emission is distributed from the driving source to its north - east at a distance of @xmath2100 , and co ( 21 ) is only seen at a distance @xmath33 ( figure  [ fig : sin ] ) .",
    "the co ( 21 ) blue - shifted outflow is likely extended over a larger region than our iram 30 m map which was designed to cover only the jet region detected in h@xmath1 .",
    "co ( 76 ) is detected in an even lower velocity range than co ( 21 ) and ( 65 ) ( figures  [ fig : sin ] and [ fig : apexch1b ] ) .",
    "spatially , co ( 76 ) is mostly detected in the inner @xmath34 region but the signal - to - noise ratio is low .",
    "the co ( 76 ) emission can be separated into two components . a compact component toward the center",
    "is seen in the velocity range    @xmath23.34.1 km s@xmath15 for which there is no detection in co ( 21 ) and ( 65 ) .",
    "an elongated component is detected in the velocity ranges of @xmath22.32.9 km s@xmath15 ( blue - shifted ) and @xmath24.35.4 km s@xmath15 ( red - shifted ) , which are associated to the collimated h@xmath1 jet .    a particularly intriguing result is found when comparing the co data with the shock tracer h@xmath1 ( figure  [ fig : sin ] ) .",
    "we find that the co ( 76 ) and ( 65 ) integrated intensities match the locus of the h@xmath1 jet well , which has a `` s - shaped '' point symmetry around the driving source .",
    "in contrast , the co ( 21 ) integrated intensity is shifted to the east of the h@xmath1 jets .",
    "it likely probes the outflow entrained gas and cavity wall detected in scattered light with irac 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : com ] shows a comparison of the sma co ( 21 ) integrated intensity map to the single - dish co integrated intensity maps .",
    "the red - shifted component of the n - s jet from the sma map is also detected with the iram 30  m telescope .",
    "however , the sma ne - sw jet associated with the h@xmath1 jet is likely hidden by the large - scale outflow emission and/or cloud emission in the iram co ( 21 ) map .",
    "nevertheless , the warm gas tracers co ( 65)/(76 ) do trace the ne - sw jet very well ( figures  [ fig : com]b and [ fig : com]c ) .",
    "a blue - shifted emission is detected in the southern part in the co ( 21 ) integrated intensity map ( figure [ fig : sin]a ) and channel map ( figures [ fig : iramch1 ] ) .",
    "this emission can also be seen in the iram and sma co ( 21 ) pv - diagrams ( see sections [ sec : pre ] and [ sec : orbwig ] ) .",
    "the component extends outside the outflow cavity ( figure  [ fig : sin ] ) and its systemic velocity of @xmath20.71.6 km s@xmath15 ( figure  [ fig : iramch1 ] ) is relatively lower than the blue - shifted outflow in all single - dish and sma maps .",
    "thus , this component is most likely not associated with the outflows . because its systemic velocity is also different from that of iras16253 as well as the ophiuchus molecular cloud , we speculate that this blue - shifted emission originates from some background sources .",

    "our single - dish co ( 21)/(65)/(76 ) maps are severely contaminated by the large - scale cloud emission especially for the co ( 21 ) transition . to remove this extended emission ,",
    "we applied a multiresolution analysis to the channel maps .",
    "this method ( see appendix c in belloche et al .",
    "2011 for details ) is based on a median filter which extracts the structures at different scales of @xmath36 pixels where @xmath371 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 with a pixel size of 5@xmath38 .",
    "the multiresolution analysis decomposes the initial map into maps containing small - scale structures ( summation maps ) and the corresponding maps containing large - scale structures ( smooth maps ) .",
    "for example , in step 3 ( @xmath39 ) , the summation map includes structures at scales @xmath6 9 pixels and the smooth map contains structures at scale @xmath40 9 pixels ; the addition of these two maps is strictly equal to the input ( observed ) map .",
    "we checked the outcome of this decomposition at each step in order to select the step at which the outflow emission and cloud emission are best separated . as a result",
    ", we took step 4 for co ( 21 ) , step 5 for co ( 65 ) , and step 4 for co ( 76 ) .",
    "we plot the integrated intensity summation maps , smooth maps , and input maps in figure  [ fig : sca ] .",
    "the channel summation maps and channel smooth maps are shown in figures [ fig : iramch1 ] to [ fig : apexch1bsmo ] . in the following ,",
    "we use the summation maps at the specific steps to derive the outflow properties .",
    "the removal of large - scale emission appears to be crucial to derive the outflow properties , especially for co ( 21 ) for which the contribution of the cloud could even be a few times stronger than the contribution of the outflows .",
    "further decomposed into the step 3 summation map ( solid line ) and smooth map ( dashed line ) using a multiresolution analysis ( see section [ sec : sca ] ) .",
    "the contour levels are 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 15@xmath41 with @xmath41 the same as in figure  [ fig : sin ] . ]",
    "the multiresolution analysis is also used to extract the jet ( knot ) from the outflow cavity .",
    "after removal of cloud emission , we further used the step 3 summation maps to separate the collimated ne - sw jet and the extended outflow cavity in co ( 65 ) ( figure  [ fig : sinsca ] ) .",
    "we applied the multiresolution analysis to the step 5 summation map of co ( 65 ) such that the sum of the two contour maps in figure [ fig : sinsca ] is equal to that in figure [ fig : sin]b .",
    "the integrated intensity summation map matches the h@xmath1 jets well while the peak of its corresponding smooth map is shifted to the east like the co ( 21 ) map ; the smooth map here includes only the extended structures in the outflows while the large - scale cloud emission has already been removed .",
    "this result suggests that the small - scale emissions may trace the collimated jet and/or the jet knots .",
    "in contrast , the large - scale structures are sensitive to the entrained gas and/or the outflow cavity wall .",
    "the s - shaped jet driven by iras16253 was first detected by @xcite through h@xmath1 emission at 2.12 @xmath13 m ( ne - sw ) .",
    "s - shaped jets are believed to originate from precessing disks @xcite which have tidal interactions with a close companion ; in other words , iras16253 is likely a proto - binary system .",
    "the sma co ( 21 ) and apex co ( 65 ) observations reveal the ne - sw jet locus and further connect the h@xmath1 patches .",
    "although the n - s `` jet '' is not associated with h@xmath1 emission , it matches the component seen in the iram co ( 21 ) map in a relatively high - velocity range of 7.859.05 km s@xmath15 ( figure [ fig : locus]b ) .",
    "in addition , it does not coincide with the edge of the cavity seen in scattered light ( figure  [ fig : smaco ] ) .",

    "given the absence of h@xmath1 emission and absence / weakness of co ( 65 ) emission in the n - s jet , the ne - sw and n - s jets must have very different physical conditions despite their similar environmental conditions in a common envelope .",

    "this result hints at a temperature of few hundreds kelvin in the jet knot , which is lower than the hot gas temperature t@xmath21000k derived from the infrared rotational transitions of h@xmath1 by @xcite .",
    "the origin of warm gas and its heating mechanisms are still debated in low - mass protostars @xcite .",
    "the possible options are summarized by @xcite as : ( 1 ) heating of the collapsing core by the protostellar luminosity within @xmath2100 au ; ( 2 ) active heating in the shock created by the interaction of the jet / outflow with the envelope ; ( 3 ) heating by uv photons along the outflow cavity wall @xcite ; ( 4 ) heating of a forming protoplanetary disk by accretion shocks @xcite .    for the large - scale co ( 65 ) outflow ,",
    "options ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) are excluded , since they predict a spatially unresolved emission toward the source center .",
    "we have decomposed the co ( 65 ) outflow into two components ( section [ sec : sca ] ) : ( 1 ) the large - scale structure matching the outflow cavity probed by irac 1 and ( 2 ) the small - scale structure that lies along the h@xmath1 jet emission ( figure [ fig : sinsca ] ) .",
    "the large - scale structure is likely due to heating by uv photons .",
    "however , the photon dominated region created by the central accretion disk is expected to have a size up to few thousands au @xcite , which is obviously too small to explain the extent of the large - scale co ( 65 ) emission ( @xmath2150 , i.e. @xmath219000 au ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the uv photons can also be produced in the bow shock regions in the outflow if @xmath215-shocks are present @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the existence of @xmath215-shocks suggested by the h@xmath1 line study @xcite .    .",
    "the ratio was computed only for the positions with a co ( 65 ) integrated intensity with a signal - to - noise ratio above 3 .",
    "the contour levels are 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , 0.9 , and 1.1 .",

    "density obtained with radex @xcite .",
    "the co column density is assumed to be @xmath216 . ]",
    "although the large - scale co ( 65 ) outflow emission mainly originates from uv heating , the knot - like structure matching the h@xmath1 jet ( figure [ fig : sinsca ] ) is likely contributed by active heating in the shock regions . by multiresolution decomposition , we extracted the small - scale component from co ( 65 ) emission ( in step 3 ) and it matches well the h@xmath1 jet .",
    "we conclude from this that these small - scale components may be associated to the jet shocks but high - angular - resolution observations are required for confirmation .",
    "in addition , these co ( 65)/(76 ) jet knots preferentially appear after the h@xmath1 emission tips ( figure [ fig : sinsca ] ) . we speculate that co is dissociated at the bow shock tip where h@xmath1 is excited .",
    "the unresolved low velocity component in co ( 76 ) ( 3.34.1 km s@xmath15 , see figure [ fig : apexch1b ] ) toward the source center can be interpreted by either option ( 1 ) or ( 4 ) .",
    "our current observations only allow us to constrain an upper limit to the size of the co ( 76 ) compact object as @xmath217 ( @xmath21000 au , the beam size without smoothing ) .",
    "this prevents us from determining the origin of this component .",
    "we note that this unresolved low velocity component is surprisingly not detected in co ( 65 ) .",
    "this casts some doubts about the existence of this component .",
    "observations with higher angular resolution and sensitivity are required to solve this issue .",
    "we derived the outflow parameters in iras16253 using radex ( table [ tab : outpa ] ) .",
    "these parameters are derived from two data sets with different assumptions : ( 1 ) sma co ( 21 ) ne - sw and n - s jets with @xmath204 cm@xmath107 and @xmath218 k , and ( 2 ) iram co ( 21 ) and apex co ( 65)/(76 ) maps ( hereafter iram@xmath12apex ) with @xmath204 cm@xmath107 .",
    "the assumption of density @xmath204 cm@xmath107 implies physical conditions close to lte .",
    "based on the analysis of iram@xmath12apex , we found an outflow temperature of around 40 k and we used it to derive the outflow parameters with the sma co ( 21 ) observation .    from iram@xmath12apex",
    ", we estimate a total outflow mass of @xmath219 ( the upper and lower limits are derived from @xmath195 and @xmath220 cm@xmath107 ) which is comparable to that in @xcite . assuming a gas temperature of 30 k",
    ", @xcite derived an outflow mass of @xmath221 from the jcmt co ( 32 ) observations in the optically thin limit ; since their co ( 3 - 2 ) observations suffer from optical depth effects , @xcite scaled the mass to @xmath222 by assuming an optical depth correction of @xmath223 .",
    "however , this correction of optical depth could be quite uncertain and/or very different from source to source .",
    "our estimate based on multi - transition observations is likely more accurate .",
    "furthermore , @xcite used seven different methods to calculate the outflow forces of low - mass protostars in ophiuchus , including iras16253 , based on the jcmt co ( 32 ) maps and our derived force is at about the median of the seven values .",
    "we here compare the outflow parameters derived from sma and iram@xmath12apex .",
    "since the mapping areas are different between sma and iram@xmath12apex observations , the outflow mass and momentum can not be directly compared .",
    "thus , we focus on the outflow force , kinetic luminosity , and mass loss rate which should be independent of the mapping areas . the sma outflow forces and kinetic luminosities are comparable with that from iram@xmath12apex , if we sum up the contributions from both ne - sw and n - s jets ( see table [ tab : outpa ] ) .",
    "we assume that the collimated jets seen with the sma are driven by the central protostars and the large - scale outflows seen with iram@xmath12apex are mostly from the entrained gas and/or outflow cavity wall .",
    "based on the results given in table  [ tab : outpa ] , we then suggest that the collimated jets provide sufficient energy to drive the large - scale outflows .",
    "identifying a proto - bd is very difficult but important for understanding the mechanisms of bd formation ( see section [ sec : int ] ) .",
    "here we discuss the parent core mass ( section [ sec : cor ] ) and the current stellar mass ( section [ sec : cendis ] ) , and then conclude that iras-16253 may have insufficient mass to form a hydrogen - burning star ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "we further use the outflow force to support this and compare with other currently known young protostars and proto - bd candidates ( section [ sec : out ] , see also section [ sec : outmacc ] ) .",
    "the growth of an accreting protostar depends on the mass in the parent core .",
    "the core mass of iras16253 was estimated in previous studies ( 0.15 m@xmath225 by barsony et al .",
    "2010 ; 0.2 m@xmath225 by stanke et al .  2006 ; 0.5 m@xmath225 by enoch et al .",
    "2008 ; 0.8 m@xmath225 by tobin et al .",
    "the inconsistencies between these results are due to different assumptions of temperatures and core sizes .",
    "although the mass of 0.8 m@xmath225 derived by @xcite using 8 @xmath13 m extinction map is temperature independent , their core size with a diameter of 0.1 pc ( @xmath2165 ) is likely overestimated ; this size is much larger than both the size derived by the complete project @xcite from the 850 @xmath13 m map ( figure [ fig : smaco]b ) and the @xmath25 size of 53@xmath9543  estimated by @xcite from their 1.2  mm map .",
    "since the source is embedded in the @xmath9 ophiuchus molecular cloud , the mass estimation considering a larger area can include a lot of material from the ambient cloud that may not participate in the accretion process .",
    "one of the uncertainty in the core mass comes from the assumed dust temperature ; @xcite derive a mass of 0.51 m@xmath225 at 1.1 mm with @xmath226 k and @xcite estimate a mass of 0.2 m@xmath225 with @xmath227  k at 1.2 mm .",
    "we derive a dust temperature of @xmath228 k using the fluxes at 70 , 100 , 160 , 350 , 1100 , 1200  @xmath13 m from @xcite by fitting a graybody model .",
    "this temperature is consistent with the values of both @xcite and @xcite within the uncertainty . rescaling the masses in @xcite and @xcite with a dust temperature of 17.4 k yields 0.41 m@xmath225 and 0.24 m@xmath225 , respectively .",
    "besides , the dust opacity used for the core mass estimate could be very uncertain .",
    "@xcite adopted the widely used theoretical opacity of @xcite which has an deviation may not more than a factor of 2 .",
    "we therefore consider 0.82 m@xmath225 as an upper limit of the core mass .",
    "if we assume a star formation efficiency ( sfe ) of 0.10.3 @xcite and that the two components ( see section [ sec : pre ] ) will accrete equal mass in the future , each component may increase its mass by only @xmath60.040.12 m@xmath229 which is close to the stellar / bd boundary . given the very uncertain dust opacity and the unpredictable future accretion ( i.e. sfe ) , it is difficult to determine the final mass of the central stars precisely .",
    "however , the very low - mass parent core likely provides material to form only a very low - mass hydrogen - burning binary or a bd binary with one or two substellar objects .",
    "the wiggling pattern caused by orbital motion in the pv diagram ( figure [ fig : pvsma ] ) gives us the opportunity to calculate the current mass of the central star(s ) in iras16253 using equation [ eq : kep ] .",
    "we derive an orbital period @xmath75 of @xmath23300 yr from the orbital velocity and radius in table [ tab : orbpa ] . taking the binary separation @xmath230 ( 69au ) , we obtain current stellar masses of 0.026 @xmath8 and 0.006 @xmath8 .",
    "the mass ratio comes from @xmath231 .",
    "this result , together with the future accretion ( @xmath60.040.12 m@xmath229 , see section [ sec : cor ] ) , implies that iras16253 will form a very low - mass binary system or a bd binary system with at least one bd .",
    "since iras16253 is located in an isolated environment , our results imply that bds can form like normal low - mass stars .",
    "two caveats should be mentioned .",
    "first , the results obtained from the fit to the pv diagrams ( table [ tab : orbpa ] ) depends on the inclination angle . we derive the total mass of the central stars to be 0.01 m@xmath229 with @xmath232 and 0.04 m@xmath229 with @xmath233 .",
    "thus , although the inclination angle affects the estimate of the central mass , it does not change the conclusion that iras16253 is probably a proto - bd binary system .",
    "second , the sinusoidal pattern in the pv diagram of the n - s jet ( figure [ fig : pvsma ] ) is not as well fitted by the model as the ne - sw jet , implying that @xmath234 and @xmath235 are uncertain .",
    "however , this would not affect the orbital period @xmath75 which is obtained from @xmath236 and @xmath237 and is independent of @xmath234 and @xmath235 ; we can also replace @xmath238 in equation ( [ eq : vorb ] ) by @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the spatial period of the jet due to the orbital motion ( see equation [ eq : vpre ] ) , such that the period can be derived with @xmath241 .",
    "taking the orbital period , we obtain the total mass of the central stars as a function of @xmath76 using equation [ eq : kep ] , @xmath242 the jvla continuum map hints that the binary separation is less than 05 although we can not exclude the possibility that the companion is too faint to be detected at 43 ghz .",
    "if we take 05 as the upper limit of separation , the total mass of the central stars would be less than 0.032 m@xmath225 .",
    "given the future accretion @xmath60.040.12 m@xmath229 ( for each component , see section [ sec : cor ] ) , iras16253 will form a very low - mass binary system which may contain bds .",
    "the weak outflow force in iras16253 also hints at iras16253 being a proto - bd .",
    "a correlation between outflow force and bolometric luminosity @xmath243 has been found and investigated in the past two decades @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared the proto - bd candidate ic 348-smm2e with vellos @xcite , first hydrostatic cores ( fhscs , larson 1969 ) , and normal protostars in the @xmath117-@xmath243 plot , in which vellos could be very low - mass protostars or proto - bds and fhscs are believed to be the youngest protostars ( see table 6 in palau et al .",
    "2014 , and references therein ) .",
    "we put iras16253 in this plot ( figure [ fig : lbol ] ) , and further highlight four vellos which are considered as proto - bds ( l1014-irs , huard et al .",

    "2011 ; ic 348-smm2e , palau et al .",
    "iras16253 is located between these proto - bd candidates and vellos . however , iras16253 is the only source which is likely a binary system among these proto - bd candidates .",
    "thus , the outflow force and the bolometric luminosity should be considered as upper limits because they are contributed by two objects .",
    "the outflow force is usually used to estimate the mass accretion rate and accretion luminosity @xmath244 in order to understand the nature of vellos @xcite . here",
    "we follow the method of accretion rate estimate in @xcite and @xcite . assuming that the gravitational energy released through a protostellar jet / outflow is correlated with the mass accretion onto the protostar , the mass accretion rate ( @xmath245 )",
    "can be represented as @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the entrainment efficiency , @xmath248 is the mass - loss rate , and @xmath249 is the jet velocity @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and @xmath252 km s@xmath15 @xcite , and obtain a mass accretion rate of @xmath253 yr@xmath15 for iras16253 . assuming 10% mass loss through jet or wind @xcite",
    ", we derive the accreted mass during the class 0 lifetime of @xmath20.16 myr @xcite to be @xmath20.068 @xmath8 . if a star accretes half of its mass at the class 0 stage , iras16253 could only reach a terminal total mass of @xmath20.14 @xmath8 ( including two components ) .",
    "this result may be considered as an upper limit because the mass accretion rate is believed to decrease as the core evolves @xcite and iras16253 with a bolometric temperature of 27 k is likely a very young class 0 object @xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with the conclusions in sections [ sec : cor ] and [ sec : cendis ] .",
    "we note that the jet velocity of proto - bds was recently found to be 50100 km s@xmath15 @xcite , which would yield an increase in mass accretion rate and terminal total mass by a factor of 1.53 , i.e. a mass of 0.210.42 @xmath8 .",
    "however , given the parent core mass of @xmath254 , the higher value would imply a sfe of 0.5 , which is unlikely .",
    "because the accretion luminosity is one of the crucial parameters for understanding the low luminosity of vellos , we calculate the accretion luminosity @xmath244 using @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the gravitational constant , @xmath257 is the accreted mass ( @xmath258 ) , and @xmath259 is the protostellar radius ( @xmath260 ) . the resulting accretion luminosity is @xmath20.03 @xmath261 .",
    "given the uncertainties on @xmath244 , this value is comparable to the internal luminosity of 0.080.09@xmath261 @xcite .",
    "episodic accretion has been proposed @xcite to solve the long - standing luminosity problem namely that the observed bolometric luminosities as well as mass accretion rates in protostars are much lower than expected @xcite .",
    "the discovery of vellos has further exacerbated the luminosity problem and vellos have become important for studying it .",
    "in episodic accretion models , a protostellar system is at a quiescent accretion stage for most of the time and accretion bursts occasionally occur to deliver material onto the central protostar @xcite .",
    "this behavior leads to protostars having a low luminosity for most of the time but still accreting sufficient mass .",
    "@xcite proposed that a recent accretion burst can be probed by comparing the observed extent of c@xmath11o emission with the predicted extent given by the current source luminosity .",
    "an accretion burst would enhance the luminosity ( i.e. , accretion luminosity @xmath244 ) which heats the parent core and shift the co freeze - out / sublimation boundary to a larger radius . after a burst , co would take a long time to refreeze - out onto the dust surfaces ( @xmath214 yr , visser et al . 2015 ) while the accretion luminosity has decayed .",
    "the c@xmath11o extent in iras16253 with a radius of @xmath2210 au ( @xmath262 , see section [ sec : cen ] ) is significantly larger than the expected radius @xmath2100 au considering the bolometric luminosity of @xmath263 ( see figure 4 in jrgensen et al .",
    "2015 ) ; the expected radius is where the temperature reaches the co sublimation region ( 2030 k ) produced by the heating from the central object .",
    "the luminosity needed to reproduce the c@xmath11o extent is a factor of @xmath24 higher than the current bolometric luminosity of iras16253 . because the c@xmath11o emission shows no clear correlation with the jets on large scales ( figure [ fig : sma ] ) , we suggest that the c@xmath11o emission is associated with the inner dense region of the envelope as the sources in @xcite . as a result ,",
    "iras16253 is likely at a post - burst stage ( or has undergone a recent accretion burst ) in the episodic accretion process .",
    "we set a model with one accretion burst that occurred during the jet dynamical time ( @xmath85 yr ) in order to examine whether we can detect the occurrence of a burst based on the jet locus . in this model",
    ", we assume that a burst occurred at -6000 yr and the mass linearly increased within 1000 yr ( end at -5000 yr ) .",
    "our model predicts a transition in the jet locus due to the accretion burst : the trajectory changes abruptly in figure [ fig : pvmod]c , with rapid variations in amplitude and period .",
    "because our model simply considers kepler s law , the path at the transition phase may not be exactly true .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the wiggling patterns are very different before and after an accretion burst .",
    "therefore , we suggest that with additional high spatial and spectral resolution data covering the whole jet , modeling the jet wiggling pattern could help identifying the accretion process ( episodic or continuous ) and assessing whether accretion bursts have occurred .",
    "we identified a proto - brown dwarf ( proto - bd ) binary system candidate through its dynamics for the first time .",
    "based on multi - transition co ( 21/65/76 ) observations from single dishes ( iram 30 m and apex ) and an interferometer ( sma ) , we studied the dynamical and physical properties of the protostellar jets driven by iras16253 in detail .",
    "the `` s - shaped '' jet detected in h@xmath1 and co ( 65 ) suggests that iras16253 hosts a close binary system . the sma co ( 21 ) data",
    "further reveal the jet wiggling caused by the orbital motion in the pv diagram , which allows us to probe the dynamics of the central binary system .",
    "furthermore , we use the multi - transition co data to derive the gas temperature and column density of the outflows . as a result , we obtain the outflow mass , momentum , and force of iras16253 .",
    "we also find that the small - scale emission of the mid - j co transitions matches the h@xmath1 emission and probes the shocked gas while the low - j co transition does not . here",

    "the proto - brown dwarf binary candidate iras16253 : 1 .   using the jet - wiggle model",

    "the low parent core mass ( @xmath265 ) further suggests that iras16253 will form a very low - mass binary or a bd binary in the future .",
    "2 .   the low outflow force implies a very low mass accretion rate in iras16253 in the main accretion phase , suggesting that it will probably form substellar objects .",
    "the outflow force versus bolometric luminosity plot also hints at iras16253 being a proto - bd binary candidate .",
    "the extended c@xmath11o emission , together with the n@xmath1h@xmath10 depletion , implies that iras16253 has experienced an accretion burst in the last @xmath210@xmath266 yr which is about the dynamical age of the protostellar jet .",

    "<S> the formation mechanism of brown dwarfs ( bds ) is one of the long - standing problems in star formation because the typical jeans mass in molecular clouds is too large to form these substellar objects . to answer this question , </S>",
    "<S> it is crucial to study a bd at the embedded phase . </S>",
    "<S> iras162532429 is classified as a very low luminosity object ( vello ) with internal luminosity @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> vellos are believed to be very low - mass protostars or even proto - bds . </S>",
    "<S> we observed the jet / outflow driven by iras162532429 in co ( 21 ) , ( 65 ) , and ( 76 ) using the iram 30 m and apex telescopes and the sma in order to study its dynamical features and physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> our sma map reveals two protostellar jets , indicating the existence of a proto - binary system as implied by the precessing jet detected in h@xmath1 emission . </S>",
    "<S> we detect a wiggling pattern in the position - velocity diagrams along the jet axes , which is likely due to the binary orbital motion . </S>",
    "<S> based on this , we derive the current mass of the binary as @xmath20.032@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> given the low envelope mass , iras162532429 will form a binary that probably consist of one or two bds . furthermore </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the outflow force as well as the mass accretion rate are very low based on the multi - transition co observations , which suggests that the final masses of the binary components are at the stellar / substellar boundary . </S>",
    "<S> since iras16253 is located in an isolated environment , we suggest that bds can form through fragmentation and collapse like low - mass stars . </S>"
