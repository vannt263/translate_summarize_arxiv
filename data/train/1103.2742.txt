    "g and k giant stars are expected to have low lithium abundances because li is destroyed in main - sequence stars except in the outermost layers ( 1@xmath0 - 2@xmath0 by mass ) . as the star ascends the red giant branch of the h - r diagram",

    "their value was also used by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter cb00 ) , who placed hd 148293 on an h - r diagram and found it was at a phase known as the `` bump in the luminosity function '' .",
    "this phase is characterized by an outwardly - moving hydrogen shell , leading to a short - lived phase of li production before it is rapidly destroyed as evolution continues . only low - mass stars that contain a highly degenerate helium core and later experience the helium flash pass through this stage and",
    "spend a mere 3@xmath0 of their ascent on the red giant branch at the bump ( @xmath380,000 years , cb00 ) .    by directly measuring the angular diameter of hd 148293 , we are able to calculate its @xmath2 when combined with other observed quantities , such as interstellar absorption and bolometric corrections .",

    "we interleaved calibrator and target star observations so that every target was flanked by calibrator observations made as close in time as possible , which allowed us to convert instrumental target and calibrator visibilities to calibrated visibilities for the target .    to check for possible unseen close companions that would contaminate our observations , we created spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
