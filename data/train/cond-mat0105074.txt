    "diffusion - limited reactions are used to model a wide range of phenomena in physics , chemistry and biology , and continue to stimulate current research .",
    "reaction - diffusion processes have been applied to studies such as stochastic spin - flip dynamics @xcite , exciton - exciton dynamics in tetra - methylammonium manganese trichloride @xcite , the kinetics of bipolymerisation @xcite , reptation of dna in gels @xcite , interface growth @xcite , diffusion of zeolites @xcite and other phenomena such as competing species in biology , self - organised criticality , pattern formation and dynamic phase transitions .    much of the effort to date has focused on reactions of the form @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with a variety of boundary and initial conditions @xcite .",
    "it is well appreciated that within the context of these models there exists an upper critical dimension @xmath13 , below which spatial fluctuations in the initial distribution of the reactants play a significant role in the evolution of the density of the particles .",
    "this dependence on the microscopic fluctuations invalidates traditional approaches such as the mean - field approximation .",
    "attempts to understand the role played by fluctuations have involved numerous techniques , including smoluchowski - type approximations @xcite and field - theoretic methods @xcite . in this paper",
    "we set out to elucidate the effects of these fluctuations on _ persistence _ within the context of the @xmath14 model .",
    "persistence phenomena have received considerable attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "theoretical and computational studies include spin systems in one @xcite and higher @xcite dimensions , diffusion fields @xcite , fluctuating interfaces @xcite and phase ordering dynamics @xcite .",
    "experimental studies include the coarsening dynamics of breath figures @xcite , soap froths @xcite and twisted nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "persistence in nonequilibrium critical phenomena has also been studied in the context of the global order parameter @xmath15 regarded as a stochastic process @xcite .",
    "reaction - diffusion models offer much scope for the study of persistence and have already contributed significantly to our understanding in this area @xcite .",
    "the definition of persistence is as follows .",
    "let @xmath16 be a stochastic variable fluctuating in space and time according to some dynamics .",
    "the persistence probability is simply the probability @xmath1 that at a fixed point in space , the quantity @xmath17 $ ] does not change up to time @xmath18 . in many systems of physical interest a power law decay , @xmath19 , is observed , where @xmath3 is the persistence exponent and is , in general , nontrivial .",
    "the nontriviality of @xmath3 emerges as a consequence of the coupling of the field @xmath16 to its neighbours , since such coupling implies that the stochastic process at a fixed point in space and time is non - markovian .",
    "two distinct types of persistence emerge naturally in the study of the @xmath20 reaction - diffusion model .",
    "consider a nonequilibrium field @xmath16 which takes values at each lattice site @xmath21 .",
    "the field evolves in time @xmath18 through interactions with its neighbours . in type i persistence , the field @xmath16 changes its sign whenever an event occurs at the lattice site @xmath21 at time @xmath18 , where an event is defined to be the reaction process @xmath14 .",
    "type ii persistence satisfies the conventional definition and the field @xmath16 changes sign when the lattice site @xmath21 is visited by either an @xmath22 or @xmath23 particle at time @xmath18 .",
    "the persistence probability at time @xmath18 is defined as the fraction of sites in which the stochastic field @xmath16 did not change its value in the time interval @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "our analysis suggests , in the case of type i persistence , that when the initial density of particles is high ( @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the density of either @xmath22 or @xmath23 particles ) , the value of the persistence exponent is identical to that which emerges in the study of the one - dimensional diffusion equation @xmath27 , as long as the running density , @xmath28 , satisfies @xmath29 .",
    "this yields @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "when , however , the initial density of particles is low ( @xmath7 ) , we find @xmath31 , in agreement with a simple heuristic argument based on the decay of the density . in the case of type ii persistence",
    "we show that the persistence decays with the `` stretched exponential '' form @xmath32 , and we provide a heuristic derivation of this based on the behavior of a toy model .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "i we introduce the model and calculate the evolution of the particle density for all @xmath26 , including @xmath33 . in section",
    "ii we present our results for type i persistence . in section iii",
    "we introduce a generalised toy model of noninteracting diffusing particles and illuminate , through a special case , the type ii persistence properties of the @xmath34 model .",
    "all our predictions are tested by extensive numerical simulations .",
    "we are concerned with the following model .",
    "consider the @xmath35 reaction involving two types of particle , both executing diffusive random walks .",
    "the particles move on a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions , and react upon contact to form an inert particle . at @xmath36 , exactly equal numbers , @xmath37 , of @xmath22 particles and @xmath23 particles are randomly distributed on the lattice .",
    "this is done by randomly assigning one half of the lattice sites to @xmath22 particles and the other half to @xmath23-particles .",
    "the @xmath22-sites and @xmath23-sites are then randomly filled with @xmath22 and @xmath23 particles , i.e.  each @xmath38-particle occupies each of the @xmath38-sites with equal probability such that , at large scales , both densities @xmath39 and @xmath40 are initially homogeneous .",
    "we define @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the size of the lattice .",
    "the two species are also given the same diffusion constant @xmath43 .",
    "our model then evolves permitting multiple occupancy of sites , but we impose an instantaneous reaction so that each lattice site contains only one type of particle .",
    "the mean - field approach yields an asymptotic decay of the particle density according to @xmath44 with an amplitude independent of the initial density .",
    "however , in low enough spatial dimension , @xmath45 , the dominating process asymptotically is the diffusive decay of the fluctuations in the initial conditions .",
    "this leads to anomalous kinetics and it was shown by toussaint and wilczek @xcite that @xmath46 this result has been confirmed using field - theoretic methods for @xmath47 by lee and cardy @xcite . the exponent @xmath48 has also been rigorously confirmed by bramson and lebowitz @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations which have been performed in one @xcite , two @xcite and three dimensions @xcite are also in good agreement with the analytical predictions of the decay exponent .",
    "however , it was noted by lee and cardy @xcite that , although in one dimension reasonable agreement with the dependence on the initial density has been found , in higher dimensions the @xmath49 amplitude dependence has not been observed .",
    "they suggest that , in the one - dimensional simulations , the initial average occupation number per site was kept low , whereas for the higher dimensional simulations it was necessary to start with a nearly full lattice in order to reach the asymptotic regime and therefore that eq .",
    "( [ tw ] ) might not be a universal result , but rather a limit for small initial density .",
    "we believe this to be the case .",
    "we focus on the particle density in one dimension . in our study of type i persistence",
    "we are particularly interested in the limit of high initial particle density , @xmath50 , where the problem should map onto simple diffusion . as a precursor to looking at the persistence ,",
    "therefore , we first consider how the particle density decays with time in this limit .    in the high - density limit , where there are many particles per site",
    ", one can neglect dynamical fluctuations in the density .",
    "if @xmath51 is the number of particles at site @xmath52 at time @xmath18 , the dynamics of @xmath51 is governed by diffusion : @xmath53 here we have adopted the convention that @xmath54 means that site @xmath52 is occupied by @xmath55 @xmath22-particles , while @xmath56 means that it is occupied by @xmath57 @xmath23-particles .",
    "then the annihilation process is automatically built into the diffusion equation ( [ diff ] ) .",
    "introducing a discrete fourier transform and taking the limit @xmath58 , gives , @xmath59.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath60 we are justified in using the approximation @xmath61 in the integrand , and extending the limits on the @xmath62-integral to @xmath63 .",

    "it s mean is clearly zero , since @xmath66 by symmetry , so its distribution is completely specified by its variance .",
    "this is independent of @xmath52 by translational invariance , so we drop the subscript and write ( again for @xmath67 ) .",
    "@xmath68 using @xmath69 we obtain , asymptotically , @xmath70    at time @xmath36 the number of particles of a given type on a given site has a poisson distribution with mean @xmath71 , where recall that @xmath26 is half the total density .",
    "hence the variance is given by @xmath72 , giving @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the standard deviation , and the probability distribution of @xmath75 is simply @xmath76   = ( 1/\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2 } ) \\exp(-n^{2}/2\\sigma^{2})$ ] .",
    "the total particle density , recalling that , with our convention , @xmath23-particles have been assigned negative values of @xmath51 , is given by @xmath77 substituting for @xmath74 from eq.([sigma ] ) yields , finally , @xmath78 the individual particle densities , therefore , decay asymptotically according to , @xmath79    it is interesting that in the low density limit @xmath7 , we recover the result of toussaint and wilczek @xcite , @xmath80 however , in the high density limit @xmath33 we obtain the same decay exponent @xmath81 as for low density but a different amplitude .",
    "the amplitude now scales as @xmath26 in contrast to the low density limit where it scales like @xmath82 : @xmath83 given the correctness of eq.([rhogeneral ] ) in both low and high density limits , we expect it to be a good approximation across the whole range of densities",
    ".    for convenience , let us write eq.([rhohigh ] ) as @xmath84 .",
    "the analytical values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 are then @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "numerical evidence has already substantiated eq.([rholow ] ) @xcite .",

    "the persistence properties of a system of noninteracting particles with zero probability of decay is described by @xmath89 . above",
    "we provide a comparison of the values of @xmath22 as deduced from the theory @xmath90 and from numerical simulations @xmath91 .",
    "our model can also be applied to the @xmath92-state potts model , which has @xmath92 distinct but equivalent ordered phases .",
    "the @xmath93 model corresponds to @xmath94 , while @xmath95 corresponds to @xmath96 .",
    "the density of walkers in the 1d potts model is known to decay asymptotically according to @xcite , @xmath97 we can derive a generalised value of @xmath98 for our toy model by substituting @xmath99 into eq.([pii ] ) where @xmath100 is given by eq.([rho(q ) ] ) .",
    "this gives , @xmath101 where @xmath102 and the subscript @xmath103 denotes ` toy ' . despite the simplistic nature of our model , a power law decay for the persistence",
    "is predicted , in agreement with known results .",
    "our expression for @xmath98 , ( eq.([thetaii ] ) ) is clearly a poor approximation to the exact expression for the 1d potts model obtained by derrida _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "@xmath104 ^ 2\\ , \\label{theta(q)}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath105 denotes ` potts ' .",
    "the values of the persistence exponent returned by our model for the @xmath94 and @xmath106 cases are , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the values given by eq.([theta(q ) ] ) for the potts model are @xmath109 and @xmath110 . the encouraging feature of our toy model , however , is that the essential dynamics of the system leading to the power - law decay of the persistence in eq.([powerlaw ] ) is correctly identified as the @xmath111 decay in the number of surviving random walkers at time @xmath18 .",
    "if the number of surviving walkers decays as @xmath112 for large @xmath18 , the toy model predicts , via eq.([pii ] ) , that the persistence will decay as a stretched exponential , @xmath113 , for @xmath114 , while @xmath115 will approach a non - zero constant for @xmath116 . the borderline case , @xmath117 , yields power - law decay of the persistence , as we have seen .",
    "we naturally now turn our attention to the @xmath118 reaction process to see if the correct time dependence of the persistence also emerges from our model . the density of @xmath22 and @xmath23 particles in this case in given by eq .",
    "( [ rholow ] ) . therefore @xmath119 is given by , @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "substituting @xmath123 where @xmath100 is given by eq.([rho(t ) ] ) into eq.([pii ] ) yields @xmath124 with @xmath125 . for the @xmath12 reaction we therefore predict a stretched exponential decay of the persistence , with exponent @xmath126 .",
    "the results of our numerical simulations are presented below .",
    "the simulations are performed on a one - dimensional lattice of size @xmath127 for @xmath127 time steps .",
    "we choose as our initial densities @xmath128 and @xmath129 . a direct test of the stretched exponential prediction is obtained by plotting @xmath130 against @xmath131 , as in figure 15 .",
    "the fact that the data do not clearly show the expected straight line behaviour may indicate that the density is not yet in the regime where it is well described by the @xmath132 form given by eq.([rho(t ) ] ) .",
    "indeed , a direct study of the density indicates that the @xmath132 behaviour is only evident at the latest times reached in the simulations .",
    "an alternative analysis involves differentiating the data with respect to @xmath133 and presenting the result as a double logarithmic plot , as in figures 16 and 17 .",
    "here there is evidence that the data approach the expected slope of @xmath126 at late times , though the noisy character of the differentiated data at the very latest times tends to obscure the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "in short , the data as presented in figures 15 , 16 and 17 are not clean enough to provide a convincing test of our prediction @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "the slow approach of the particle density to its asympotic @xmath136 behaviour is , in our view , the reason for this .",
    "a better test of our model , therefore , is to consider the persistence as a function of the actual running density of particles , rather than using the asymptotic behaviour of the density in eq.([pii ] ) . taking the log of eq.([pii ] ) and differentiating with respect to @xmath133 yields , @xmath137 since @xmath138 , the running density .",
    "the left - hand side of eq.([plot ] ) and @xmath139 ( without the factor @xmath140 ) are plotted in figures 18 and 19 for the two densities studied .",
    "the two curves agree rather well over the whole range of @xmath133 , except at the latest times , where the date are very noisy .",
    "the factor @xmath140 in eq.([plot ] ) , omitted from the plots , has the numerical value @xmath141 ( recall @xmath142 ) , whereas figures 18 and 19 suggest this number should be closer to unity .",
    "given the crudeness of the toy model , however , the agreement between the data and the model is surprisingly good .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the persistence properties of the @xmath143 reaction - diffusion process using two distinct definitions of persistence . in type i persistence",
    ", we studied the fraction of sites which had never witnessed an annihilation process . in the high density limit",
    "@xmath33 we argued that the persistence exponent is that which emerges from a study of the one dimensional diffusion equation , @xmath144 , where @xmath145 @xcite , and presented data consistent with this result . in the low density limit",
    "@xmath146 we argued that the persistence properties are governed by the same exponent that describes the decay of the particle density , giving @xmath147 .",
    "again , the data support this prediction . in type ii persistence , we considered the probability that a site remained unvisited by either an @xmath22 or @xmath23 particle .",
    "our approach , in this case , was to develop a toy model , which can be applied to any reaction - diffusion process and expresses the persistence properties in terms of the density of the reactants .",
    "for the @xmath148 process the model predicts @xmath149 . the data are consistent with this result when allowance is made for the actual time - dependence of the particle density ( rather than just its asymptotic form ) . an obvious goal for future study would be to to place this stretched - exponential decay on a firmer theoretical foundation .",
