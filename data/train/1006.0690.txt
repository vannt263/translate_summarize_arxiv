    "the classification of electronic phases according to topological invariants is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of matter .",

    "it may be expressed as the first chern number associated with the bloch wavefunctions of the occupied states .",
    "a fundamental consequence of this topological classification is the _ bulk - boundary correspondence _ , which relates the topological class of the bulk system to the number of gapless chiral fermion edge states on the sample boundary .",
    "recent interest in topological states@xcite has been stimulated by the realization that the combination of time reversal symmetry and the spin orbit interaction can lead to topological insulating electronic phases @xcite and by the prediction@xcite and observation @xcite of these phases in real materials .",
    "a topological insulator is a two or three dimensional material with a bulk energy gap that has gapless modes on the edge or surface that are protected by time reversal symmetry .",
    "the bulk boundary correspondence relates these modes to a @xmath6 topological invariant characterizing time reversal invariant bloch hamiltonians .",
    "signatures of these protected boundary modes have been observed in transport experiments on 2d hgcdte quantum wells@xcite and in photoemission and stm experiments on 3d crystals of bi@xmath7sb@xmath8@xcite , bi@xmath9se@xmath10@xcite , bi@xmath9te@xmath10@xcite and sb@xmath9te@xmath10@xcite .",

    "the topological classifications , given by @xmath17 , @xmath6 or @xmath18 show a regular pattern as a function of symmetry class and @xmath16 , and can be arranged into a _ periodic table _ of topological insulators and superconductors .",

    "topologically protected zero modes and gapless states can also occur at topological defects , and have deep implications in both field theory and condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "a simple example is the zero energy majorana mode that occurs at a vortex in a @xmath13 superconductor@xcite .",
    "similar majorana bound states can be engineered using three dimensional heterostructures that combine ordinary superconductors and topological insulators@xcite , as well as semiconductor structures that combine superconductivity , magnetism and strong spin orbit interactions@xcite .",

    "this suggests that a more general formulation of topological defects and their corresponding gapless modes should be possible .",
    "= 3.2 in    in this paper we develop a general theory of topological defects and their associated gapless modes in bloch and bloch - bdg theories in all symmetry classes . as in ref . , we assume that far away from the defect the hamiltonian varies slowly in real space , allowing us to consider adiabatic changes of the hamiltonian as a function of the real space position @xmath1 .",
    "we thus seek to classify hamiltonians @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is defined in a @xmath16 dimensional brillouin zone ( a torus @xmath23 ) , and @xmath1 is defined on a @xmath24 dimensional surface @xmath25 surrounding the defect .",
    "a similar approach can be used to classify cyclic temporal variations in the hamiltonian , which define adiabatic pumping cycles .",

    "we find that for a given symmetry class the topological classification ( @xmath17 , @xmath6 or @xmath18 ) depends only on @xmath40 thus , all line defects with @xmath41 have the same topological classification , irrespective of @xmath16 , as do point defects with @xmath42 and pumping cycles with @xmath43 .",
    "though the classifications depend only on @xmath44 , the _ formulas _ for the topological invariants depend on both @xmath16 and @xmath24 .",
    "this topological classification of @xmath21 suggests a generalization of the bulk - boundary correspondence that relates the topological class of the hamiltonian characterizing the defect to the structure of the protected modes associated with the defect .",

    "a similar pumping scenario can be applied to superconductors and defines a _ fermion parity pump_. this , in turn , is related to the non - abelian statistics of ising anyons , and provides a framework for understanding braidless operations on systems of three dimensional superconductors hosting majorana fermion bound states .",
    "details of several technical calculations can be found in the appendices .",

    "<S> we develop a unified framework to classify topological defects in insulators and superconductors described by spatially modulated bloch and bogoliubov de gennes hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> we consider hamiltonians @xmath0 that vary slowly with adiabatic parameters @xmath1 surrounding the defect and belong to any of the ten symmetry classes defined by time reversal symmetry and particle - hole symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the topological classes for such defects are identified , and explicit formulas for the topological invariants are presented . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a generalization of the bulk - boundary correspondence that relates the topological classes to defect hamiltonians to the presence of protected gapless modes at the defect . </S>",
    "<S> many examples of line and point defects in three dimensional systems will be discussed . </S>",
    "<S> these can host one dimensional chiral dirac fermions , helical dirac fermions , chiral majorana fermions and helical majorana fermions , as well as zero dimensional chiral and majorana zero modes . </S>",
    "<S> this approach can also be used to classify temporal pumping cycles , such as the thouless charge pump , as well as a fermion parity pump , which is related to the ising non - abelian statistics of defects that support majorana zero modes . </S>"
