    "valuable information about globular clusters and galaxy formation can be obtained by investigating the extent to which the properties of globular clusters belonging to different galaxies are similar .",
    "for example , differences in initial mass function during cluster formation and/or in susbsequent cluster dynamical evolution , which may both depend on galactic environment , would translate into differences in present - day stellar content .",
    "the globular cluster stellar content can be characterized by the mass - to - light ( @xmath2 ) ratio , which can now be determined for relatively remote globular clusters .    collecting all the available data from the literature , pryor & meylan ( 1993 ) derive @xmath1 ratios for 56 galactic globular clusters using king - michie dynamical models .",
    "they obtain _ global _",
    "@xmath1 ratios ranging from about 1 to 5 with a mean of 2.3 ( in solar units ) , and found no significant correlations ( apart from a possible weak one between @xmath1 and cluster mass ) between the _ global _ @xmath1 ratios and other parameters such as metallicity , concentration , half - mass relaxation time , or distance from either the galactic center or the galactic plane .",
    "@xmath1 ratios similar to those obtained for galactic clusters have been obtained in studies of globular clusters belonging to the magellanic clouds ( dubath et al .",
    "1996b ) and to the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dubath et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "another way of investigating globular cluster similarities , in terms of structure and @xmath1 ratio , is to look at the correlations between velocity dispersion , luminosity and a physical size scale .",
    "these correlations , which are analogous to the fundamental plane correlations for elliptical galaxies , have already been discussed for galactic clusters by several authors ( e.g. , meylan & mayor 1986 , paturel & garnier 1992 , djorgovski & meylan 1994 , djorgovski 1995 ) .",
    "the tight correlation between the velocity dispersion , the core radius and the central surface brightness obtained for galactic clusters ( djorgovski 1995 ) is consistent with expectations from the virial theorem assuming that galactic globular cluster cores have a universal and constant @xmath1 ratio to within the measurement errors .",
    "because of its relative proximity and large size , the m31 globular cluster system is an obvious target for the study of extragalactic clusters .",
    "previous studies of various aspects of the m31 globular cluster system have been reviewed by fusi pecci et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , huchra ( 1993 ) , tripicco ( 1993 ) , and cohen ( 1993 ) .",
    "the only velocity - dispersion determinations of m31 clusters published so far are by peterson ( 1988 ) .",
    "corresponding @xmath1 ratio estimates are given for two clusters and are found to be similar to those typically obtained for galactic clusters .",
    "a limitation in this work , however , arises from the difficulty of measuring m31 cluster structural parameters from the ground . in m31",
    "the angular sizes of core and half - light radii are typically @xmath002 and @xmath01 , respectively .    in this work ,",
    "we present new velocity dispersion and @xmath1 ratio determinations for a sample of m31 globular clusters , for which structural parameters derived from hst observations are available in the literature .",
    "the @xmath1 ratio estimates are based on simple relations derived from the virial theorem and from king models .",
    "our velocity dispersion estimates are also key observational constraints for more detailed dynamical analyses , e.g. , based on fokker - plank or king - michie multi - mass models , which are beyond the scope of this paper .    the spectroscopic observations and the data reduction are presented in sect .  2 .",
    "numerical simulations used for deriving velocity dispersions from the integrated - light spectra and the corresponding results are described in sect .",
    "section  4 discusses the structural parameters , and @xmath1 estimates are given in sect .",
    "the relations between velocity dispersion , luminosity and different physical scales are discussed in sect .  6 for our m31 cluster sample together with samples of clusters belonging to the galaxy , the magellanic clouds , the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy , and centarus a. we summarize our findings in sect .",
    "we obtained 12 high - resolution integrated - light spectra of 10 globular clusters belonging to m31 .",
    "the observations were made september 9 - 11 , 1994 ( see table  [ tabsig ] ) , with the hamilton echelle spectrograph ( vogt 1987 ) operated at the coud focus of the 3-m shane telescope of the lick observatory .",
    "the detector was a thinned , backside - illuminated ti ccd , with 800  800 pixels of 15  15 @xmath3 m each , and with a readout noise of about 6 electrons .    during the first night , a relatively wide entrance slit of 20  50 was used to match poor seeing conditions .",
    "a slit of 15  50 was used during the second and the third nights . as a consequence ,",
    "the instrumental resolution , as estimated from the fwhm of the emission lines of thorium calibration spectra , was slightly lower during the first night ( 31000 or 9.7 ) than during the second and the third ones ( 35000 or 8.6 ) .",
    "both slits used have widths larger than the apparent half - light radii ( see table  [ tabmol ] ) of all our clusters .",
    "table  [ tabsig ] gives the date of the observations , the exposure time ( texp ) and the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of the cluster spectra . during each observing night",
    ", many radial velocity standard stars were also measured .",
    "spectra of a thorium - argon lamp were taken 6 - 8 times through each of the three nights .",
    "the spectra were reduced with inter - tacos , a new software package developed in geneva by d.  queloz and l.  weber .",
    "the first - night spectra contain 50 useful orders ranging from 4800 to 8300  , and those obtain the second and third night contain 49 orders ranging from 4600 to 7500  .",
    "the different orders do not overlap , i.e. , the echelle spectra exhibit holes in the wavelength coverage .",
    "the orders are never rebinned , nor merged together .",
    "the shifts in velocity between the different thorium - argon lamp spectra taken during one particular night are always smaller than 1 .",
    "however , a velocity shift as large as 5  is observed between the second and the third nights . as a first step , for each night ,",
    "one wavelength solution is computed from a thorium - argon spectrum , and applied to all the spectra taken during that particular night .",
    "the cluster spectra also contain numerous strong night - sky oh and o2 emission lines , because of the long exposure time on relatively faint objects .",
    "the residual velocity zero - point shift of each globular cluster spectrum is then derived by measuring the mean shift ( in velocity ) of the emission lines compared to their accurate rest wavelengths ( taken from osterbrock et al .",
    "1996 ) . as a second step of the wavelength calibration , all the _ globular cluster _",
    "spectra are corrected according to these velocity zero - point shifts .",
    "the reduced spectra are cross - correlated with an optimized numerical mask , used as a template ( see dubath et al .",
    "1990 for the details of the cross - correlation technique ) .",
    "in short , our template contains lower and upper wavelength limits for each line from a selected sample of narrow spectral lines . for a particular radial velocity ,",
    "the value of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) is given by the sum , over all spectral lines , of the integral of the considered spectrum within the lower and the upper line limits shifted according to the given velocity .",
    "the ccf is thus built step by step over the velocity range of interest .",
    "the ccf is not affected by the fact that the spectra are composed of a succession of independent orders , with holes in the wavelength coverage .",
    "the ccf is a kind of mean spectral line over the approximately 1400 useful lines spread over the spectral ranges of the different orders .",
    "the lower and upper limits of the lines are computed from a mix of observed and theoretical high - resolution spectra of k2 giants , in such a way as to optimize the ccf ( see dubath et al.1996a ) .    when the number of considered lines is large enough ( @xmath4 several hundreds ) , this cross - correlation technique produces a ccf which is nearly a perfect gaussian .",
    "a gaussian function is fitted to each derived ccf in order to determine three physical quantities : ( 1 ) the location of the minimum equal to the radial velocity , ( 2 ) its depth @xmath5 , and ( 3 ) its standard deviation , related to line broadening mechanisms .",
    "figure  [ ccf ] displays the ccfs of the integrated - light spectra obtained for the m31 globular clusters in our sample .",
    "we have a total of 32 measurements of 11 standard stars , mostly giant stars of spectral type g8 to k4 , collected during the same observing run .",
    "the comparison of the standard - star radial velocities with reference values provided by coravel measurements ( mayor , private communication ) shows that the instrumental radial velocity accuracy is of order 0.5  and that the zero - point shift between the two datasets is not significant . in the case of the m31 clusters ,",
    "the accuracy of the radial velocity zero - point is very probably even better owing to our use of the night - sky emission lines to calibrate the zero point of each cluster spectrum .",
    "the mean value of the widths ( ) of the ccfs obtained for our sample of standard stars is 5.80.3  for the first night , and 5.50.2 for the two others .",
    "this difference is the direct consequence of the different slit widths used .",
    "we see no dependence of the ccf width on spectral type over the range considered here ( g8 to k4 ) .",
    "we also know that the ccf width does not depend on the star metallicity from previous measurements of a large number of various types of metal - deficient stars ( see fig .",
    "6 of dubath et al .",
    "the _ projected _ velocity dispersions can be derived from the broadening of the cluster ccfs .",
    "this broadening results from the doppler line broadening present in the integrated - light spectra because of the random spatial motions of the stars .",
    "since the spectrograph slit used is large compared to the the m31 globular clusters apparent size , a very large number of stars contributes significantly to the integrated light .",
    "quantitatively , recent numerical simulations ( dubath et al .  1994 , 1996a ) show that statistical errors , which can be very important for integrated - light measurements of some galactic globular clusters because of the dominance of a few bright stars , are negligible in the present case .",
    "an integrated light spectrum of an m31 globular cluster is well approximated by the convolution of the spectrum of a typical globular cluster star with the projected velocity distribution .",
    "since the ccf is a kind of mean spectral line , the above property also hold for ccfs .",
    "the ccf of an integrated - light spectrum of a globular cluster is the convolution of the ccf of the spectrum of a typical globular cluster star by the projected velocity distribution .",
    "since the ccfs have a gaussian shape , an estimate of the projected velocity dispersion  in the integration area of a globular cluster is given by the quadratic difference ,    @xmath6    where  is the width of the gaussian fitted to the cluster ccf and  is the average width of the  obtained for a sample of standard stars , as representative as possible of the cluster stars which contribute most to the integrated light .",
    "we do not use this formula directly in the present study . in order to derive the cluster projected velocity dispersion ,",
    "we carry out a large number of numerical simulations .",
    "the results of these simulations confirm , however , the validity of eq .  [ sigest ]",
    "( see sect .  [ gene ] ) .      in order to simulate the integrated - light spectrum and the ccf obtained for globular cluster , we proceed in several steps . in the first row of fig .",
    "[ simuill ] , the integrated - light spectrum ( left ) and the ccf ( right ) obtained for the cluster bo  218 are displayed .",
    "corresponding simulation results are displayed in the last row , while the intermediate steps of the simulation are illustrated in the middle row of this figure .",
    "the simulation input parameter is the cluster velocity dispersion ( ) .",
    "the simulation starts with a high signal - to - noise spectrum of a standard star of appropriate spectral type , e.g. , a k2 giant . to simulate the doppler line broadening ,",
    "this spectrum is convolved with a gaussian function of standard deviation equal to the input velocity dispersion .",
    "a portion of the standard - star spectrum , before and after convolution , is shown in the panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ simuill ] .    \\2 . in general",
    ", the spectral lines of the convolved standard - star spectrum do not have the same depths as those of a given cluster spectrum , mainly because of possible metallicity difference .",
    "the next step is thus to adjust the depth of the standard - star spectral lines .",
    "this is done by scaling the convolved standard - star spectrum so that its ccf is of the same depth as the cluster ccf .",
    "( with our cross - correlation technique , there is a clear relationship between the average depth of the spectral lines of a spectrum and the depth of the spectrum ccf ) . in fig .",
    "[ simuill ] for example , the spectra and the ccfs displayed in the middle row are linearly scaled so that the convolved spectrum ccf ( the broad ccf in panel d ) be of the same depth as the cluster ccf ( in panel b ) .",
    "a noiseless template of a cluster spectrum  for one particular velocity dispersion   results from the second step .",
    "random noise is added to this template spectrum to simulate the photon counting and ccd readout noises of observed cluster spectra .",
    "a portion of the template spectrum for bo  218 ( c ) and of one example of simulated noisy spectrum are displayed in panel ( e ) of fig .",
    "[ simuill ] .",
    "we then cross - correlate the simulated noisy spectrum and derive the radial velocity ( ) and the sigma ( ) of the resulting ccf .",
    "this third step is repeated a large number of times ( 100 to 150 times ) to observe the influence of the noise on and .",
    "panel ( f ) of fig .",
    "[ simuill ] shows three examples of simulated ccfs taken at random .",
    "the comparison of the upper and the lower panels of this figure shows how well our simulations reproduce the integrated - light spectrum and the ccf obtained for bo  218 .    in order to derive the best estimates of the projected velocity dispersion ( ) in the clusters , we proceed as follows . for each cluster , a set of different input velocity dispersions ( ) , varying by step of 0.5 or 1  around the expected cluster `` true '' velocity dispersion ( first evaluated with eq .",
    "[ sigest ] ) are considered . for each ,",
    "100 or 150 simulations are carried out and the relative number of times that the width of the simulated ccfs is consistent with the width of the observed ccf is reported .",
    "consistent means here that the sigma of the simulated ccf must be within  0.2 - 0.5  ( depending on the different cases ) of the sigma of the observed ccf .",
    "figure  [ simudis ] shows , in the case of bo  218 , the distribution of these numbers as a function of the input velocity dispersions ( ) of the simulations .",
    "this distribution is a kind of probability distribution ; the best estimate of the `` true '' cluster velocity dispersion is given by the  which leads most often , through the simulations , to a ccf consistent with the observed one .",
    "for example , among 100 simulations carried out with  = 16 , 47 have a width consistent with the width of the observed ccf obtained for bo  218 , while none of the 100 simulations with  = 13  is successful in reproducing the observed ccf .",
    "a similar distribution is derived for each cluster , and a gaussian is fitted to each of them . the resulting means and sigmas , which provide the most probable cluster velocity dispersions ( ) and their uncertainties , are given in column ( 11 ) of table  [ tabsig ] .",
    "this section presents a generalization of the simulation results ( which can be skipped by less concerned readers ) . for each of the 9 clusters ,",
    "simulations are carried out for a set of input velocity dispersions ( ) . in the simulations , a particular cluster is characterized by the spectrum s / n ratio and by the depth ( @xmath5 ) of the cluster ccf . therefore in general ,",
    "the input parameters are the spectrum s / n , the ccf depth @xmath5 , and the input velocity dispersion . for each set of input parameters ,",
    "100 to 150 simulated ccfs are computed , and distributions of the resulting radial velocities and ccf sigmas are thus produced .",
    "the standard deviations of these distributions  @xmath7 ( ) for the radial velocities and @xmath7 ( ) for the sigmas  provide estimates of the uncertainties due to the spectrum noise . the following formula",

    "this equation gives in , ( 1 ) @xmath7 ( ) with an accuracy of order of 10% , and ( 2 ) @xmath7 ( ) ) with an accuracy of about 20% .",

    "( 3 ) of dubath et al . ( 1990 ) to broad ccfs .",
    "the constant @xmath9 is lower in the present paper than in this previous study because the larger wavelength range , and consequently larger number of spectral lines , taken into account in the cross - correlation process ( @xmath9 scales roughly with the square root of the number of lines ) .",

    "this makes measurements of @xmath14 difficult , as attested to by the large range of values obtained by different authors for the same clusters .",
    "fortunately , six of the clusters in our sample have recently been observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and accurate values of @xmath14 have been published ( fusi - pecci   1994 [ bo218 , 384 ] ; grillmair   1996 [ bo6 , 45 , 343 , 358 ] ) .",

    "an alternative to the somewhat model - specific method used above is a straightforward application of the virial theorem :    @xmath48    where we have assumed an isotropic velocity distribution and @xmath49 ( spitzer 1987 ) , where @xmath50 is the half - mass radius . the masses computed using this equation are given in column 8 of table [ tabmol ] .",

    "the corresponding values for @xmath1 are given in column 10 and 11 of table [ tabmol ] .",
    "the @xmath1 ratios given in table [ tabmol ] are remarkably similar to those typically found in galactic globulars ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) .",
    "bo158 and 225 might seem a trifle high , but we note that both these clusters have only ground - based measurements of @xmath14 .",
    "it is entirely possible that these estimates of @xmath14 suffer from incomplete removal of the effects of seeing and are consequently too high .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty in @xmath1 is generally in the estimation of @xmath14 , being of the order of 15% even for the hst - imaged clusters .",
    "uncertainties in the magnitude estimates of battistini , in our estimates of the local extinction , and in the velocity dispersion measurements contribute @xmath54 each to the final uncertainty . bo343 and 358 are exceptions to this general rule , having",
    "reasonably well - measured core radii , but rather less well - determined velocity dispersions .",
    "the formally estimated uncertainties in @xmath1 are @xmath55 for those clusters observed with hst , and probably closer to 50% for those clusters imaged only from the ground .",
    "table  [ tabmol ] shows that the @xmath1 ratios derived with eq .",
    "[ virial ] ( column 11 ) are systematically @xmath050% larger than those obtained with eq .",
    "[ mass ] ( column 10 ) .",
    "this gives a rough idea on how model dependent are our estimates .",
    "another way to investigate similarities among different globular cluster populations is to look at the relation between velocity dispersion , luminosity , and a physical size scale . in such a parameter space ,",
    "systematic differences between two systems of globular clusters , in terms of structure or @xmath2 ratio , would result in either different mean relations or in different degrees of scatter about a given relation .",
    "we do not attempt here to derive mean relations through bivariate fits ( e.g. djorgovski 1995 ) as they turn out to be rather unstable because of both the small number of data points as well as the weak correlation between the physical size parameter and the luminosity and velocity dispersion .",
    "instead , we fit to the data the relations expected from the virial theorem , or from the king models . assuming a constant @xmath1 ratio , the virial theorem predicts the relation    @xmath56    between the _ global _ velocity dispersion @xmath57 , the half - light radius @xmath15 , and the absolute visual magnitude .",
    "similarly , king models predict    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the _ central _ velocity dispersion , @xmath3 a dimensionless parameter which varies with cluster concentration @xmath16 , @xmath14 the core radius , and  the absolute visual magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fp ] shows the relations between @xmath60 vs. @xmath61 ( uppermost row of panels ) , @xmath62 vs. @xmath61 ( second row ) , and @xmath63 vs. @xmath61 ( third row ) , for different data sets .",
    "for the galactic clusters we use velocity dispersion measurements based on radial velocities of individual stars , taken from the compilation of pryor and meylan ( 1993 ) .",
    "for the other clusters , we use velocity dispersions derived from integrated - light observations , taken from dubath et al .",
    "( 1996a ) for 8 old magellanic clusters , from dubath et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for 3 clusters belonging to the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy , from the present study for 9 m31 clusters , and from dubath ( 1994 ) for 10 centaurus a clusters .",
    "the continuous lines represent the relation @xmath64 ( uppermost row ) , and the relations ( [ virial_2 ] ) and ( [ king_2 ] ) , in the second and third rows respectively , with constants derived by fitting the _ galactic _ cluster data .",
    "the dashed lines show the relations obtained when central velocity dispersions ( extrapolated for these clusters by pryor and meylan [ 1993 ] using king models ) are considered instead of the _ global _ velocity dispersion .",
    "it is worth mentioning that correlations resulting from bivariate fits do not differ much from the relations expected from the virial theorem ( djorgovski 1995 ) , and that fig .  [ fp ] would look very similar if slightly different projections were used .",
    "the scatter of the data points probably results to a large extent from measurement errors , and it is quite remarkable that this scatter is of the same order in all panels of fig .",
    "the similarity of the different panels of fig .",
    "[ fp ] indicates both that there is no large systematic differences in globular cluster @xmath1 ratios between one galaxy to another , and that measurement errors are comparable , and even smaller , for extragalactic clusters than for galactic clusters .    in the first row of fig .",
    "[ fp ] , we expect a higher degree of scatter since the physical scale of each cluster ( which acts as a second parameter ) is not taken into account .",
    "notably , a few large - size / low - concentration galactic clusters lie well below the other clusters in the upper left panel .",
    "the fact that similar large clusters are not present in our m31 and cen a samples is due to a selection bias which favors brighter and generally more compact clusters . in any case , the relatively small spread of the data points around the straight lines in the uppermost panels points to an additional similarity in terms of physical size range between the clusters of these different galaxies , with the possible exception of the old magellanic clusters .",
    "this is particularly interesting in the case of the centaurus a clusters since these clusters are brighter than the galactic ones , but their physical scales have not yet been measured .    for the old magellanic clusters , the products @xmath3 @xmath14 are systematically _ smaller _ than the galactic average .",
    "this can perfectly explain why the magellanic clusters appear above the galactic relation in the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fp ] , while the magellanic and galactic middle panels are similar .",
    "the lower panel is , however , rather puzzling .",
    "unexpectedly , the data points all lie above the galactic relation , as if the half - light radii used here and taken from van den bergh ( 1994 ) were about 40% too large .",
    "this point is further discussed in another paper ( dubath et al .",
    "1996b ) .",
    "the two m31 clusters ( bo158 & 225 ) with large @xmath1 ratio estimates from last section stand out above the galactic relation in fig .  [ fp ] . as already pointed out",
    ", these clusters only have ground - based measurements of @xmath14 which may be overestimates .",
    "the scatter of the other clusters is remarkably small compared to the scatter of galactic clusters .      as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fp ] , the absolute magnitude of an individual globular cluster can be derived from its velocity dispersion and physical scale with an accuracy of @xmath00.5 magnitude . for a given parent galaxy , providing there is no systematic differences in @xmath1 , an accurate distance modulus can in principle be computed using the mean distance modulus of a moderate number ( 10  20 ) of its associated globular clusters . in other word , plotting apparent instead of absolute magnitude in fig .",
    "[ fp ] , the difference between the distance modulii of two parent galaxies is given by the horizontal shift required to bring the two ( dereddened ) data sets in agreement . combining the capabilities of the hst and of 10-m class , ground - based telescopes , this method could be applied for galaxies out as far as the virgo cluster .",
    "in this paper , we present projected velocity dispersion measurements from integrated - light spectra for a sample of 9 m31 globular clusters . by means of comprehensive numerical simulations ,",
    "we show that the typical relative uncertainty of our measurements is @xmath05% . because of the relatively large distance of m31 and the aperture angular size used our integrated - light observations sample a large fraction of these very bright clusters .",
    "consequently , statistical uncertainties due to small samples of bright dominant stars which can affect integrated - light measurements of nearby galactic clusters are completely negligible .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical simulations presented in dubath et al .",
    "( 1996a ) .",
    "paradoxically , it is in some respects easier to measure the _ global _ velocity dispersion of a m31 cluster than that of a galactic clusters .",
    "for the brightest m31 clusters , reliable velocity dispersions can be measured with a 3-m - class telescope using single exposures of order one hour long .",
    "previous velocity dispersion measurements are available from peterson ( 1988 ) for 3 of our clusters .",
    "the agreement is good for the cluster bo20 , while we obtain significantly lower and more accurate values for bo158 and 225 .    combining the new velocity dispersions with structural parameters , we compute the cluster @xmath1 ratios using relations derived from king models and the virial theorem .",
    "these @xmath1 ratios appear remarkably similar to those found for galactic clusters ( see e.g. , pryor & meylan 1993 ) .",
    "two clusters ( bo158 & 225 ) having only ground - based measurements of @xmath14 have @xmath1 ratio estimates somewhat above the range of galactic values .",
    "it is entirely possible that these estimates of @xmath14 suffer from incomplete removal of the effects of seeing and are consequently too high .",
    "another way to investigate similarities of globular clusters located in different parent galaxies is to look at the relation between velocity dispersion , luminosity and a physical scale ( fig  [ fp ] ) . using additional data from previous papers , we find remarkable similarities , in terms of @xmath1 ratios and structures , between the globular clusters located in our galaxy , the magellanic clouds , the fornax dwarf spheroidal , m31 , and centaurus a. it is worth emphasizing that our samples include some of the brightest m31 and centaurus a clusters , which are both brighter and more massive than any galactic cluster , as expected because of the larger number of clusters in both these galaxies .",
    "our m31 cluster sample is not large enough to investigate possible correlations between the @xmath1 ratio estimates and other cluster parameters .",
    "only a weak correlation is observed with galactic data ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) , and it is possible that the variations of the current @xmath1 estimates from one cluster to another result to a large extent from measurement errors .    p.d .",
