    ".    however , such the conclusion conflicts with cosmological modeling the universe evolution and properties of its large scale structure , that is characterized by a high degree of homogeneity for the spatial distribution of matter ( @xmath15 for fluctuations of energy density @xmath16 and temperature of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , @xmath17 ) , because such calculations lead to the necessary introduction of dark matter with the density being approximately 5 times greater than the baryonic density @xcite , if we follow the equations of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "in cosmology of homogeneous and isotropic universe , the points in the space with coordinates @xmath18 move as given by a dependence of scale factor on the time , @xmath19 , so that velocity @xmath20 and acceleration @xmath21 of material point are determined by @xmath22 where the dot over a symbol denotes the derivative with respect to time .",
    "due to the homogeneity and isotropy , the evolution equations do not contain the co - moving coordinate @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the evolution law is universal , and it can be considered at small @xmath18 , i.e. in the region of applicability of the non - relativistic mechanics ( @xmath23 ) and gravity law by newton , namely , the acceleration of free falling along the radius vector @xmath24 reads off @xmath25 where we introduce the komar  tolman gravitational mass , where the symbol @xmath17 corresponds to the tensor of energy - momentum and its trace , and @xmath26 denotes the metric . therefore ,",

    "in addition , the adiabatic law of energy conservation for the substance with the energy density @xmath16 and pressure @xmath27 reads off @xmath31 so under the substitutions of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , we get @xmath34 then , after multiplying ( [ ddot ] ) by @xmath35 we can easily integrate and get the friedmann equation @xmath36 where we have introduced the hubble constant @xmath37 , while in gr the constant of integration @xmath38 is presented by the sum of contributions given by a constant spatial curvature and a matter with equation of state @xmath39 .",
    "these terms do not contribute to the komar  tolman mass , i.e. they do not produce the gravitational force .",
    "thus , we get the equations of gr for the evolution of homogeneous and isotropic universe ( [ conserv2 ] ) and ( [ hubble1 ] ) . then , the description of such evolution is reduced to the non - relativistic dynamics at @xmath40 .",
    "the straightforward application of mond paradigm at @xmath40 implies the transition to the regime of modified law of gravity , when @xmath41 hence , @xmath42 notice that a direct observation of the scale factor evolution by the registration of type ia supernovae @xcite reliably shows that the accelerated universe expansion ( @xmath43 ) at present has changed the decelerated expansion ( @xmath44 ) , which took place at the redshift . ]",
    "@xmath45 , where @xmath46 is extracted in the procedure of fitting the deceleration parameter @xmath47 by the linear function @xmath48 .",
    "consequently , in vicinity of transition point @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , the validity of mond in cosmology is quite justified",
    ".    however , eq . ( [ mond - old ] ) at @xmath51 is inconsistent with the condition of homogeneity and isotropy of matter , since the actor @xmath52 explicitly depends on the co - moving coordinate @xmath14 , hence , such the modification of gravity law is inherently related to the inhomogeneity of matter distribution . in particular , eq .",
    "( [ mond - old ] ) results in the _ vacuum catastrophe _ : the vacuum with @xmath53 is to be unstable , namely , due to eq .",
    "( [ mond - old ] ) the inhomogeneous distribution of matter is initiated .",
    "thus , the straightforward transfer of mond to the cosmology is theoretically inconsistent .",
    "nevertheless , keeping in mind that mond is related to the spatial inhomogeneity of matter distribution , we can easily suggest its cosmological extrapolation for the homogeneous and isotropic universe , indeed : by setting @xmath54 we arrive to the evolution equation at @xmath55 @xmath56 which is consistent with the initial conditions imposed on the matter as well as with the vacuum stability .",
    "on the other hand , the visible large scale structure ( lss ) is seen at the angle distances of @xmath57 radians , that corresponds to @xmath58 , where the hubble horizon @xmath59 at the current value @xcite @xmath60 empirically in mond @xcite @xmath61 so that if we put @xmath62 then we expect @xmath63 it is convenient to parameterize the quantity @xmath64 in the form @xmath65 whereas by the order of magnitude @xmath66    thus , we can assume that the change of regime in the cosmological extrapolation of mond as given by ( [ g0 ] ) is caused by the presence of spatial inhomogeneity of matter , that allows us theoretically to conform the existence of two regimes for the critical acceleration of gravity .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the scheme proposed in ( [ g0 ] ) and ( [ k ] ) for the cosmological extrapolation of mond with the parametrization in the transition region as derived in the holographic description of gravity as the entropic force @xcite at low temperatures ( the mond regime ) @xcite .",
    "this way essentially differs from the relativistic theory of gravity for the mond paradigm offered by j.bekenstein in @xcite , wherein he constructed the action satisfying a set of requirements , which include the appropriate limit to the mond regime as well as , in principle , a correct description of cosmological effects , too .",
    "the modification is very specific due to additional gravitational scalar and vector fields in the action .",
    "additional fields appear in the modified gravity formulated by j.w.moffat in @xcite , too .",
    "then , the gravitational constant becomes the field satisfying the equations of motion .",
    "so , j.w.moffat has obtained the modification of gravity law @xcite similar to the mond , but it is distinguishable from the mond , while some cosmological effects can be treated in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "thus , approaches in @xcite and @xcite represent the axiomatic attempts to construct the consistent theory of modified gravity from the primary principles of field theory , and they are able to produce the framework for complete calculations including the propagation of cosmological perturbations in the relativistic way , of course . we follow a more pragmatic way : without an introduction of any new additional notions , the modification of gravitational dynamics in the form of ( [ g0 ] ) and ( [ k ] ) can be consistent with the mond at galactic scales , and it is enough for the investigation of modified cosmological evolution essentially different from the evolution in the framework of general relativity if we consider the ordinary components of matter .",
    "therefore , the extrapolated mond could exhibit some general features , which are common for meaningful extensions of general relativity as they tend to exclude the dark matter from the cosmology _",
    "dynamically_. in this way , we understand that the specific additional gravitational degrees of freedom defined explicitly as in @xcite and @xcite should be inevitably considered if we try to take into account the modification of theory for the propagation of matter inhomogeneity in cosmology , hence , in the construction of full range description of large scale structure of universe , that includes the matter power spectrum and anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation . in the general relativity , that is the dark matter , which is responsible for the actual description of all features in the large scale structure due to corrections to the matter distributions during the cosmological evolution , but it is commonly known that basic cosmological characteristics such as the accelerated - decelerated regimes of universe expansion , and the visible angular scale of matter inhomogeneity in the sky are mainly given by the appropriate evolution rate of universe , and we show that such the evolution can be achieved in the framework of cosmological extrapolation of mond without any dark matter",
    ". this extrapolation does not provide us with the complete theory of inhomogeneity propagation ( especially , because such the theory is expected to be nonlinear in contrast to the well - working ordinary linear perturbation theory in the general relativity ) , hence , we do not suppose to reproduce the full description of angular dependence of cosmic microwave background radiation subject to the given primary spectrum of matter distribution , of course , or the big - bang nucleosynthesis , for instance .",
    "nevertheless , the baryonic matter inhomogeneities themselves can produce the potential gravitational wells for the further concentration of matter , though such the wells would be affected by the sound propagation in the photon - electron - baryon plasma , and this evolution of inhomogeneities will be mainly determined by the strong field regime of mond , which is consistent with the general relativity , while the nonlinear effects are expected to be subleading .",
    "thus , we can expect the correct reproduction of main features of large scale structure in the framework of cosmological extrapolation of mond .",
    "so , our preliminary studies show that the first acoustic peak in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy is successfully obtained within the cosmological extrapolation of mond under the very standard settings of primary spectrum of matter power without any dark matter , of course , while the second peak can be also correctly described by an appropriate variation of the matter power spectrum , but the subleading structures need the construction of full theory of cosmic perturbations beyond of purposes of our paper .",
    "so , the analysis of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation would be presented elsewhere , since it requires a deep and comprehensive investigation in details .",
    "the similar note can be addressed to the problem of nucleosynthesis , too . here , we present the general scheme for the cosmological extrapolation of mond and its applications to the basic features of universe evolution .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the minimal scheme of ( [ g0 ] ) and ( [ k ] ) to the description of data on type ia - supernovae .",
    "we show that in the redshift region accessible for observations , such the astronomical data can be reliably described in the proposed model if there are the cosmological constant and baryonic matter , only , without any dark matter , whereas the numerical estimate of ( [ estimatek ] ) is correct .",
    "while comparing with the friedmann cosmology at presence of dark matter , we can evaluate the imitated contribution of dark matter @xmath67 to the critical density of @xmath68 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath69 to the baryonic contribution @xmath70 is roughly determined by @xmath71 in order of magnitude . in accordance to the standard friedmann cosmology - model with the cold dark matter and cosmological constant ( @xmath72cdm ) , the parameters correspond to @xmath73 at @xmath74 .",
    "further , we analyze the large scale structure of inhomogeneity in the matter distribution of universe in calculations of baryon acoustic oscillations , measured by observing the luminous matter in the sky versus the redshift @xcite , and in estimation of `` acoustic scale '' in the cmbr anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the estimates obtained in the framework of cosmological extrapolation of mond agree with the measured values of lss without any postulation of hypothetic dark matter : it is enough to adjust the value of baryonic matter in the presence of cosmological constant .",
    "then , the density of baryonic matter is roughly twice its value in @xmath72cdm of gr .",
    "after modeling the acoustic scale in the cmbr anisotropy we calculate the critical acceleration @xmath75 in the framework of the cosmological extrapolation of mond and find preferable values of cosmological parameters of the universe ( the density of baryonic matter ) .",
    "we analyze the evolution into the future , too .    in conclusion",
    "we summarize our results and discuss its meaning .",
    "at present , measuring the stellar magnitude of type ia supernovae versus the redshift gives the only direct observation of scale factor versus time in cosmology .",
    "such the observation does not base on any model of universe expansion , so that even the theory beyond the friedmann equation can be confronted to the experiment without any additional assumptions . in this respect , such the data are unique and they are suitable for testing the cosmological extrapolation of mond .",
    "the stellar magnitude @xmath76 depends on the redshift according to the formula @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the absolute stellar magnitude , i.e. the stellar magnitude of light source at the distance of 10 pc .",
    "the photometric distance @xmath79 measured in mpc , is determined by the hubble constant evolution @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the speed of light . in @xcite",
    "the following dependence of the deceleration parameter on the redshift has been used as the working hypothesis : @xmath82 that allows it to describe the supernovae data at values @xmath83 essentially different from zeros , whereas the parameters significantly correlate ( see details in the original paper @xcite ) .    according to ( [ q - lin ] ) , the hubble constant @xmath84 that should be reasonably compared with the case of zero deceleration parameter , when @xmath85 from eqs .",
    "( [ mu])([h - nil ] ) we see that normalizing the data at low redshifts , i.e. measuring the value of @xmath86 , allows us to plot a fiducial dependence of supernovae stellar magnitude @xmath87 with the deceleration parameter equal to zero , and further , systematically to study the deviations from this dependence versus the increasing redshift .",
    "data from @xcite are shown in figures [ ev1 ] and [ dif - ev1 ] .",
    "they confidently signalize on the accelerated expansion of universe at present as well as on the existence of transition from the decelerated expansion to the accelerated one at @xmath88 .",

    "in this paper we have conformed the mond to its cosmological extrapolation , that allows us to eliminate hypothetical dark matter not only at scales of spatial inhomogeneity of baryon matter distribution in galaxies and galactic clusters , but also in the description of universe evolution up to the redshift of @xmath206 in the observation of type ia supernovae . in this conformation ,",
    "the angular size of inhomogeneity in the large scale structure of universe is essential .",
    "another question , related to the cosmology and modification of gravity , is the necessity to postulate the dark matter in order to describe the cmbr anisotropy in @xmath72cdm . to our point of view",
    ", this problem is also closely connected to the usage of friedmann model of expansion at redshifts from zero to @xmath167 , when the cmbr inhomogeneity was formed .",
    "clearly , parameters such as the contribution of cosmological term into the energy budget of universe and the fraction of dark matter can be mostly significant at low redshifts , exactly when the modification of gravitational law becomes remarkable at low accelerations of expansion .",
    "however , the forming of cmbr essentially depends on the proportion between the baryons and dark matter . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution of the baryonic density versus the redshift is completely determined by the conservation law of matter , hence , the conformation of the baryon densities in both @xmath72cdm and mond allows us to generate similar conditions for the interaction between photons and electrons , which density correlates with baryons .",
    "the problem of considering the anisotropy evolution versus the redshift at the whole interval in the framework of cosmological mond expects a solution , i.e. the question about a detailed investigation of cmbr anisotropy still remains open within the cosmological extrapolation of mond . in this respect",
    "we have to mention the field theory - approaches in @xcite and @xcite , which can , in principle , provide us with complete calculations for the propagation of perturbations , whereas the theory by j.bekenstein @xcite includes the mond regime for inhomogeneous distribution of matter .",
    "however , we follow another motivation based on the minimal extension of mond that satisfies the reasonable constraint on the transition to the cosmology of homogeneous distribution of matter . in this way",
    ", we note that some integral quantities , which values are deduced by the consideration of cmbr anisotropy , are derived under the assumption of friedmann evolution and they can not be straightforwardly transferred to the modified law of gravity .",
    "this note is also valid as concerns for the observation of large scale structure , i.e. in studying the baryon acoustic oscillationscdm the spatial inhomogeneity of both the matter and dark matter are generated , say , by the primordial spectrum of inhomogeneity as given by quantum fluctuations of a scalar filed having caused the universe inflation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the baryonic and dark matter initially has got common locations of compression - decompression regions , that is consistent with the assumption about the joint concentration of baryonic and dark matter .",
    "however , the baryon oscillations having the electromagnetic nature , suggest that the inhomogeneities of the photon - electron - baryon medium propagate as sound waves decoupled from the dark matter ( except the interaction due to gravitational forces ) , while the inhomogeneities of dark matter do not propagate at all , since there are no sound in the dark matter . during the evolution after the baryon acoustic oscillations stopped , the gravitational interaction attracts the centers of baryonic and dark matter concentration , that results in a partial nearing the locations of matter lumps .",
    "the transfer function of initial perturbations in the energy densities consists of two different parts given by the terms of baryonic and dark matter .",
    "consequently , initially coinciding regions of concentration for the baryons and dark matter become spatially separated , that creates different centers of gravitational contraction of baryons and dark matter in the future evolution .",
    "thus , the existence of baryon acoustic oscillations challenges the dark matter hypothesis by asking for a natural explanation for the coincident locations of baryons and dark matter in galaxies , that rises the additional problem in a dynamical derivation of the tully  fisher law in the framework of standard cosmology . ]",
    "( bao ) caused by the spatial inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have analyzed the `` angular scale '' in the cmbr anisotropy and parameters of baryon acoustic oscillations in the framework of cosmological mond and showed that mond can confidently describe these cosmological phenomena .",
    "then , we can conclude that the cosmological mond has exhibited its positive potential for the adequate description of universe evolution at low redshifts as well as up to the redshifts of cmbr forming .",
    "we have to note , of course , that the purpose of this paper has been not a complex fitting the type ia supernovae data , baryon acoustic oscillation and cmbr anisotropy , but the aim has been the demonstration of opportunity to get the successful application of cosmological mond to those problems .    finally , we have compared the critical acceleration calculated in the framework of cosmological mond with its empirical value and extract the intervals of cosmological parameters , wherein there is the good agreement of the model with observations of wmap+bao+sn+ @xmath86+@xmath75 .",
    "in addition , we have found that the modification of gravity law is essential in studying the problem of cosmological constant .",
    "thus , the preliminary estimates performed in the framework of cosmological mond conceptually permit for the confidential description of universe evolution and point to the necessity to work out a cumbersome analysis of complete base of the data on the supernovae , large scale structure , baryogenesis and abundance of elements in the universe etc .",
    ", for the accurate extraction of cosmological parameters , in particularly , the baryonic fraction of energy . nevertheless , in this paper we have shown that hypothetical dark matter can be completely excluded from the cosmology by the appropriate modification of gravity law at accelerations less than the critical value in analogy to the case , when it was successfully done at the galactic scale in mond .",
    "notice , there are several papers , wherein the influence of modified law of gravity to the universe evolution at low accelerations was considered @xcite , however , in those papers the acceleration is evaluated by the temperature of apparent horizon @xmath207 giving @xmath208 , while the critical acceleration is the constant value independent of distance . in @xcite",
    "this approach follows the mond at the linear dependence of factor modifying the acceleration @xmath209 on ratio @xmath210 .",
    "hence , it is clear that such the modification of gravity law at the hubble horizon is extrapolated inside the hubble sphere , that can be never conformed with our consideration .",
