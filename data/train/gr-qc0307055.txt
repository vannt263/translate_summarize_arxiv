    ", width=480 ]    it is of interest to ask why our approach has not been implemented previously .",
    "a number of factors were at work .",
    "it has been universally assumed that the computational overhead of elliptic solvers is excessive .",
    "choptuik @xcite indicates a time penalty of @xmath91 , incurred by a fully constrained @xmath92 evolution , compared to free evolution .",
    "this cost is justified by the much longer physical lifetimes achieved in the ( @xmath92 ) evolutions of ref @xcite ; choptuik s factor of two in time is considered a small penalty . however , in previous implementations of constrained ( @xmath92 ) evolution , one additionally had the problem that the solvers were restricted , for instance to conformally flat situations .",
    "this required strong gauge constraints on the evolution , and meant that generally one re - solved a strongly nonlinear equation ( comparable to the initial value problem ) , on each time step .",
    "but we have found , even working with straightforward package solvers , that the penalty for our approach is only of order 30% .",
    "this is because our constraint solver ( developed for kerr - schild superposed initial data ) , is in fact completely general with no form restrictions on the background .",
    "( there are , of course , general conditions on the elliptic equations to allow their solution @xcite , but we have encountered no difficulties in working with physically realistic configurations ) .",
    "thus our elliptic solver can use backgrounds that are strongly nonflat .",
    "they may be strongly nonflat , but they are already very close to constraint solution .",
    "this is so because they arise from evolving one timestep with an accurate time integrator ; we use a package integrator which is typically fourth order accurate in time , and the spatial discretization is also fourth order .",
    "there is thus only a very small correction arising from the elliptic solve , and minimal outer iteration is required .",
    "further , we take note of the fact that our explicit time integration has a certain inherent order of truncation error .",
    "thus we do not in fact set the residual limit for the elliptic solve anywhere near machine accuracy .",
    "instead we set it so that it produces errors which are consistent in size with the evolution truncation error .",
    "this reduces the _ internal _ iteration in the solver to a very small number .",
    "finally , computational resources are now becoming adequate for constrained 3-d evolution .",
    "@xmath93tflop / sec computers are now accessible , making this work plausible .",
    "it will always be the case that constrained evolution is more computation- and memory- intensive than unconstrained , but the time has arrived that interesting constrained evolutions are possible .",
    "further , ongoing computational infrastructure improvements will make this level of computation generally accessible .",
    "well within a decade , desktop access to @xmath94 tflop / sec will mean that constrained evolutions at lisa- or ligo- relevant resolutions will become unexceptional .",
    "we have demonstrated that the analytical formulation is not critical to long term evolution of single black holes , if the correct constraint subtraction is used .",
    "thus ,  modern \" approaches that pose explicitly hyperbolic approaches are not essential ;  traditional \" @xmath0 - @xmath3 methods produce comparably long evolutions .",
    "the evidence seems to be that there are many formulations and subtraction schemes that lead to long - term single black hole stability ; we have found an especially simple one .    however , we have found , consistent with theoretical estimates , that the precise subtraction is critical ( a fraction to two or three decimals ) . to attack this problem ,",
    "we have carried out periodic solution of the elliptic constraint equations as part of the time integration , to enable fully constrained evolutions of the einstein equations .",
    "our initial results demonstrate dramatic improvement of long term stability of a nonspinning black hole simulation . because we solve the constraints , constraint subtraction is irrelevant in this case .",
    "we are beginning exploration of the constrained evolution approach in spacetimes involving single moving , and multiple interacting black holes .",
