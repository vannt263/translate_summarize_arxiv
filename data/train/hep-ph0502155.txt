    "@xmath5 meson has been observed experimentally @xcite , and within theoretical uncertainties and experimental errors the observations are consistent with the theoretical predictions . in view of the prospects in @xmath5 physics at the fermilab tevatron ii and lhc ,",
    "@xmath5 physics is attracting more and more attentions .",
    "the hadronic production of the @xmath5 meson ( its ground state mainly ) , has been studied quite well @xcite .",
    "especially , a generator bcvegpy @xcite for hadronic production of @xmath5 meson has been available , which can be easily complimented to the pythia environment @xcite and enhances the efficiency to generate the full @xmath5 events greatly in comparison with using pythia itself .    in the framework of effective theory of nrqcd @xcite ,",
    "a heavy quarkonium is considered as an expansion of various fock states . the relative importance among those infinite ingredients",
    "is evaluated by the velocity scaling rule .",
    "a similar idea can be applied to the double heavy meson system too .",
    "that is , the physical state of @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons can be decomposed into a series of fock states : @xmath12 and @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the relative velocity .",
    "note that throughout this paper we use the symbols @xmath2 and @xmath3 to denote the four physical @xmath4-wave states ( @xmath2 denotes the @xmath4-wave state with the dominant color - singlet state @xmath15 , while @xmath3 denotes the @xmath4-wave states with the dominant color - singlet states @xmath16 as described in eq.([eq:2 ] ) ) instead of @xmath17 that is used in ref.@xcite . here",
    "the thickened subscripts of the @xmath18 denote for color indices , @xmath19 for color singlet and @xmath20 for color - octet ; the relevant angular momentum quantum numbers are shown in the parentheses accordingly . according to the velocity scaling rule ,",
    "the probability of each fock state in the expansion is proportional to the scales in a definite power of @xmath14 , squared the indicated one as the above .",
    "generally , the leading fock states of the @xmath5 and @xmath21 states are @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , whose probability in respect of the relative velocity are set to be the order of @xmath24 . also for the production of the @xmath5 and @xmath21 states",
    ", there is no problem at all , one can be sure that the contributions from leading fock state(s ) are dominant .    as implied in equations eq.([eq:2 ] ) , at leading and next leading order , the production of @xmath4-wave @xmath5 mesons may involve in the fock states : @xmath7 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ; @xmath8 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 . for color - singlet components ( @xmath4-wave ) ,",
    "the long distance non - perturbative matrix elements can be directly connected with the first derivative of the wave functions at the origin , which can be computed via potential models@xcite and/or potential nrqcd ( pnrqcd)@xcite and/or lattice qcd etc at the accuracy for the present purposes , whereas , there is no reliable way to offer such accurate values for the color - octet non - perturbative matrix elements as those for color - singlet ones even for lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "so far , we may only have rough values of these matrix elements relating to the components @xmath29 , @xmath30 by means of the velocity power counting rule of the nrqcd effective theory @xcite . in order to make a reasonable estimate on the contributions from the color - octet components to the hadronic production so as to see",
    "if the color - octet components are visible experimentally or not , we take a similar way as done in ref.@xcite , i.e. the color - octet matrix elements are taken to be smaller by certain order in @xmath31 than those obtained by relating them to the color - singlet @xmath32-wave wavefunctions at the origin @xmath33 . whereas , the first derivative of the wavefunctions ( @xmath4-wave ) at the origin for the color - singlet components with proper factor of @xmath34 ( the reduce mass of the bound state ) , i.e. @xmath35 , is in a higher order in @xmath14 than the wavefunctions at the origin for the @xmath32-wave functions , @xmath36 , therefore the contributions from the color - octet components @xmath25 , @xmath37 ( @xmath32-wave ) to the production of the @xmath4-wave excited states @xmath2 and @xmath11 may be comparable with those from the color - singlet components @xmath7 and @xmath38 ( @xmath4-wave ) .",
    "the color - singlet contributions to the @xmath4-wave @xmath5 meson hadronic production have been studied in refs.@xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the hadronic productions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 were estimated by applying the fragmentation approach .",
    "while in refs.@xcite the authors adopted the lowest order ( here @xmath39 ) complete approach but only color - singlet components @xmath7 and @xmath38 were taken into account , and found that the total cross - section is much larger than what predicted by the fragmentation approach @xcite , and the fragmentation results tend to be comparable with those from the @xmath40 complete calculation only in the cases when the transverse momentum @xmath41 of the meson @xmath5 is so high as @xmath42 gev ( higher than @xmath32-wave production case ) @xcite . for the @xmath39 complete estimation , to be complete and to see the characteristics , we compute the contributions from the color - octet components to the @xmath4-wave @xmath5-meson production precisely in the paper .    the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we will present the basic formulae for the lowest order ( @xmath40 ) which are used in the complete calculation of the contributions to the @xmath4-wave hadroproduction from the color octet components @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in section iii , we will explain the options about the input parameters , which are necessary for the calculations and will present the numerical results properly . in the last section , a brief summary and some discussions will be given .",
    "in hadron - hadron collisions at high energy , the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism is the dominant one over the others .",
    "hence , to study the hadronic production of the @xmath4-wave @xmath5 mesons , as argued in the preceding section , we need to consider two types of processes , i.e. , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is in color - singlet @xmath47 and @xmath48 states ; and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is in color - octet @xmath51 and @xmath52 states . in ref.@xcite , the color - singlet contributions to the hadronic production of @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been computed , and the useful formulas and techniques have been explained there . for simplicity ,",
    "we will not repeat it here . in the present work ,",
    "our main concern is to complete the calculations on the hadronic production of the @xmath4-wave @xmath5 physical states , especially to pay attention to the contributions from the color - octets @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the amplitude for the @xmath55 can be analytically obtained by applying the helicity method @xcite , and @xmath50 will be ` hadronized ' to the state @xmath25 or @xmath56 finally .",
    "the details of the helicity technique can be found in ref.@xcite and references therein .",
    "the difference of the present calculations is only in the color configuration from those for the leading order @xmath57 meson hadronic production .    in the case of the hadronic production @xmath58 where @xmath46 is in color - singlet , @xmath59 or @xmath60",
    ", there are only three independent color factors ( i.e. three independent color flows@xcite ) . while for the case of the hadronic production of the color - octet states , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is in color - octet and will be hadronized to @xmath61 or @xmath54 finally , there are totally ten independent color factors , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , where @xmath64 are color indices of the quarks @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "they are @xmath67t^b_{ij}\\;,\\;\\ ; c_{4ij}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } tr\\left[t^bt^d\\right]t^a_{ij}\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ c_{5ij}&= & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}tr\\left[t^bt^at^d\\right]\\delta_{ij}\\;,\\;\\ ; c_{6ij}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } tr\\left[t^at^bt^d\\right]\\delta_{ij}\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ c_{7ij}&= & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}n_c}\\left(t^dt^bt^a\\right)_{ij}\\;,\\;\\ ; c_{8ij}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}n_c } \\left(t^dt^at^b\\right)_{ij}\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ c_{9ij}&= & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}n_c}\\left(t^at^dt^b\\right)_{ij}\\;,\\;\\ ; c_{10ij}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}n_c } \\left(t^bt^dt^a\\right)_{ij}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the indices @xmath68 and @xmath66 are color indices for gluon-1 and gluon-2 respectively , and @xmath69 stands for the color of the color - octet state @xmath50 in the production .",
    "@xmath70 , for qcd .",
    "all the color factors in the subprocess can be expressed by the linear combination of the above ten independent color factors , @xmath71 in the amplitude all the color factors may be written in terms of these ten explicitly .",
    "thus the total helicity amplitude can be generically expressed as @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 denote the helicities of the out - going @xmath66-quark , out - going @xmath65-quark , gluon-1 and gluon-2 , respectively .",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 are the momenta of the gluons ; @xmath79 , @xmath80 are the momenta of @xmath81 and @xmath66 quarks and @xmath82 , @xmath83 are the momenta of @xmath65 and @xmath84 anti - quarks , respectively . the helicity amplitude @xmath85 can be directly read from the eqs.(4 - 8 ) in ref.@xcite , with only the color - singlet matrix elements ( or the wave function at the origin ) being replaced by the color - octet matrix elements @xmath86 and @xmath87 . to get the matrix element squared , one needs first to deal with the square of the above ten independent color factors , i.e. ( @xmath88 ) with @xmath89 . for reference use ,",

    "now let us compute the observables with cuts on @xmath41 and/or @xmath102 , so as to see the the cut effects in @xmath2 and @xmath3 production precisely .",
    "namely we have investigated the effects in production rate and various differential cross sections and for the color - octet production and the color - singlet production of @xmath32-wave ( @xmath5 and @xmath21 ) and @xmath4-wave ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) respectively .",

    "considering the abilities on measuring @xmath41 and @xmath102 rapidity of @xmath5 for cdf , d0 , btev at tevatron and for atlas , cms , and lhc - b at the lhc , we compute the @xmath41 distributions with the rapidity cuts @xmath103 , and the @xmath102 distributions with the transverse momentum cut @xmath104 gev accordingly .",
    "the results with four rapidity cuts , @xmath105 , are put together in fig.([lypt ] ) and the results with four transverse momentum cuts , @xmath106 gev , are put in fig.([lpty ] ) .",
    "in the paper , according to the nrqcd expectation about the importance for the components , we have precisely investigated the contributions of the @xmath32-wave color - octet components to the hadronic production of the @xmath4-wave @xmath5 states .",
    "our final results show that contributions from the color - octet ones are comparable to those from the color - singlet ones in the production of the @xmath4-wave @xmath5 excited states if the scale rule of nrqcd works well and the value of the relative velocity squared @xmath31 is really in the possible region @xmath107 , as indicated by potential models for the @xmath108 binding system for instance . therefore , to make a soundly prediction to the hadronic production of the @xmath4-wave @xmath18 meson at leading order in @xmath31",
    ", one needs to take both contributions from the color - octet @xmath32-wave fock states and those from the color - singlet @xmath4-wave fock states into account . with @xmath96 and @xmath109 gev ,",
    "the total contributions from the color - octet @xmath32-wave fock states to the total production cross section is about @xmath110 from the color - singlet @xmath4-wave states at lhc and about @xmath111 at tevatron respectively , and such contributions decrease with the increment in @xmath112 , e.g. at @xmath100 gev , it reduces to @xmath113 at both energies of lhc and tevatron .",
    "this character may used for people to distinguish the color - singlet contributions from those from color - octet ones in future when there are enough @xmath2 and @xmath3 data .",
    "note that for shortening the paper and not changing the main feature , here we have not taken the possible mixing between @xmath2 and @xmath114 into account at all . according to nrqcd scale rule , except the components @xmath115 and @xmath116",
    ", there is no enhancement factor , such as that comes from the wave function at the origin for the @xmath32-wave components virus the derivative of the wave function at the origin for the leading @xmath4-wave color - singlet ones , so we consider the contributions from the other high order fock components in eq.([eq:2 ] ) small , and ignore them at all .    in summary , the total cross - section of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 production , including both singlet and octet contributions , at the lowest order in @xmath117 and @xmath31 expansions , may be so bigger than a half of the direct production rate of the ground state @xmath118 ( see table.ii , roughly speaking : @xmath119 for lhc and @xmath120 for tevatron ) .",
    "considering the fact that almost all of the low - laying excited states decay to the ground state @xmath5 , it also means that the full low - laying @xmath4-wave state production ` promptly ' contributes the @xmath118 production by a bigger factor than @xmath121 of the direct one .",
    "especially , if @xmath122 , the contributions from color - octet components themselves may contribute promptly a factor @xmath123 of the direct hadronic production of @xmath5 meson .",
    "furthermore , our complete calculations also indicate that the observation of the @xmath4-wave @xmath5 states is not very far from the present experimental capability in principle .",
