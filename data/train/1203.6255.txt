    "but , of course , the sdss imaging strategy had to be adjusted to make this calibration work : good redundancy was required in the data stream , and a redundancy of a very specific kind .",

    "sources are generated with random coordinates ( uniformly distributed within the sky region being investigated ) and with random magnitudes @xmath4 distributed according to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the density of sources @xmath7 per unit magnitude @xmath4 and per unit solid angle @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are model parameters . even though our simulations make no distinction between galaxies and stars , the values of the parameters",

    "it is only the variations on larger scales that we aim to constrain with the self - calibration procedure .",
    "our final assumption in these simulations is that the instrument response is temporally stable .      in this work",
    "we are interested in simulating complete surveys , in order to identify the crucial characteristics of survey strategies that allow for the relative instrument response model to be accurately , retrospectively constrained from the resulting catalog .",
    "we therefore apply the single exposure procedure introduced in the previous section for each pointing specified in a defined survey strategy , which is a set of pointings @xmath19 and orientations @xmath57 .",
    "the resultant source measurements are collated into a survey - wide catalog .",
    "we self - calibrate the catalog generated in the survey simulations to recover an optimum estimate of the true instrument response applied and the true source fluxes .",
    "this self - calibration procedure has been successfully applied to ground - based imaging surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , where the procedure is dubbed `` uber - calibration '' , and the deep lens survey @xcite .",
    "this iterative procedure comprises two steps : ( 1 ) a refinement of the source flux estimates based on the latest instrument response model and ( 2 ) a refinement of the instrument response model based on the updated source flux estimates .",
    "these steps are iterated until the system converges , or until it is clear that the system will not converge .",
    "there is a degeneracy in the problem , as both the true instrument response and the true source magnitudes are unknown .",
    "it is therefore only possible to calibrate the _ relative _ instrument response and the _ relative _ source fluxes .",
    "it is not possible to know , for example , if the sources are all fainter or if the instrument response is uniformly lower . in practice",
    ", this degeneracy can be broken through observations of a small number of standard absolute sources .      to introduce a realistic level of ignorance into the simulations",
    ", we use the self - calibration procedure to fit a model that is _ incomplete _ in two ways .",
    "firstly , the _ fitted _ instrument response is modeled as an eighth order polynomial , and not the second order polynomial superimposed with sine and cosine contributions used to model the _ true _ instrument response .",
    "secondly , the assumed measurement uncertainty variances do not include the additional random measurement error @xmath58 introduced in subsection [ sec : noise ] .",
    "we therefore fit for the following , incomplete measurement model : @xmath59 where @xmath25 is the recorded count rate , @xmath60 is the fitted instrument response model at a focal - plane position @xmath61 , @xmath62 is a vector parameterizing the eighth order polynomial instrument response model , @xmath63 is the model source flux estimate and the error @xmath32 is drawn from the normal distribution @xmath64 , such that @xmath65 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the parameters set by the instrument s @xmath66 detection and the s / n @xmath41 limits .",
    "the @xmath34 error contribution is intentionally not included in order to simulate systematic problems with the instrument noise model .",
    "we make one further assumption during this analysis phase , namely that clearly variable sources have been removed from the source catalog , and that the remaining sources vary by less than @xmath38 .",
    "the sources are considered individually in the first step of the self - calibration procedure ; their flux estimates are refined based on the latest fitted instrument response parameters @xmath62 .",
    "an error function @xmath67 for all the measurements @xmath24 of a source @xmath26 ( @xmath68 ) is constructed : @xmath69 where @xmath25 are the measured count rates , @xmath60 is the fitted instrument response model at a focal - plane position @xmath61 and @xmath70 is the assumed noise model . a new estimate of the model source flux @xmath71",
    "is then found by minimizing the error function with respect to the old model source flux @xmath72 : @xmath73 @xmath74^{-1 }   \\left [ { \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{o}(k ) } \\frac{f_{i}(\\vec{x_i } | \\vec{q } ) \\ , c_i}{{\\sigma_i}^2 } } \\right ] \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the standard uncertainty variance on the new source flux estimate @xmath71 is given by @xmath75 \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the instrument response parameters can now be refined with the latest source flux estimates . a error function for all the measurements of all the sources",
    "is constructed @xmath76 where @xmath77 recall that the fitted instrument response @xmath78 is modeled as an eighth order polynomial .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath79 where @xmath80 in this case .",
    "the total error function @xmath81 can be rewritten as @xmath82 to refine the instrument response model fit , this error function is minimized with respect to the instrument response model parameters @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 it is now simpler to proceed in matrix notation .",
    "the following substitutions can be made @xmath86 the matrix equation is then @xmath87 the refined instrument response parameters are then found by @xmath88 these two steps are iterated until the solution converges to a final fit of the instrument response @xmath89 and the source fluxes @xmath90 , or until it is clear that a solution will not be found .",
    "it is worthy of note that although this back - and - forth ( step 1 , step 2 ) iteration scheme works well and is easy to understand , there is no reason in principle not to simply put the whole system into a non - linear optimizer .",
    "a sufficiently clever general - purpose optimizer might outperform these bilinear iterations . at the scale of the simulations and optimizations performed in this paper ,",
    "there is no need to look for higher performance algorithms than the bilinear iterative solution presented here .",
    "to assess the performance of the self - calibration procedure with different survey strategies , it is necessary to quantify the quality of the final fitted solution . to do this we defined three quantities .",
    "the first is the root - mean - squared ( rms ) error @xmath91 in the final fitted source fluxes @xmath90 compared to the true source fluxes @xmath29 for the @xmath92 sources used in the self - calibration procedure : @xmath93 in detail , we compute this @xmath91 excluding sources near the survey boundary .",
    "the other two metrics , called `` badnesses '' , are defined as the error between the final fitted instrument response and a reference instrument response sampled on a regular @xmath94 grid across the focal plane . for the `` true badness '' @xmath95 , the _ fitted _ instrument response @xmath89",
    "is compared to the _ true _ instrument response @xmath96 at the @xmath97 sample points @xmath98 the `` best - in - basis badness '' @xmath99 compares the _ fitted _ instrument response @xmath100 to the _ best instrument response fit possible _",
    "@xmath101 with the basis used to describe the fitted model ( in this case an eight order polynomial ) at the @xmath97 sample points @xmath102 the best - in - basis badness is always smaller than the true badness , as it does not include the errors associated with the limitation of the basis used for the fitted model .",
    "the badnesses provide a more complete description of the self - calibration performance than the rms error on the fitted sources fluxes , as the rms source error only applies to the bright sources within the survey selected for the self - calibration procedure .",
    "in this paper , we consider four simple but very different survey strategies .",
    "we use the end - to - end catalog simulation and self - calibration chain , introduced in sections [ sec : survey_simulations ] and [ sec : self_cal ] , to evaluate the performance of the self - calibration procedure with these strategies .",
    "the parameters of these simulations are summarized in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "we label the four survey strategies  which all cover the same 64  deg@xmath103 patch of sky  with the letters a to d. these survey strategies are summarized in table [ tab : simple_surveys ] and are shown in figure [ fig : simple_surveys ] .",
    "strategy a is the simplest strategy ; the target field is regularly tiled with small overlaps between adjacent pointings ( @xmath104  percent in both of the camera pointing directions ) .",
    "the pointings in the 9 passes over the same field are exactly aligned .",
    "survey b is the same as a , but with each pass over the target field the orientation of the telescope is rotated by @xmath105 .",
    "survey c is more complex .",
    "the first pass over the field is the same as in survey a , with @xmath106 pointings . in the next pass ,",
    "one of the pointings in the @xmath107 direction is removed and one is added in the @xmath108 and the pointings are respaced uniformly , so the resultant pointing grid is @xmath109 . in the third pass over the field this change",
    "is reversed and the field is measured on a @xmath110 grid .",
    "these three passes are then repeated three times .",
    "the pointing positions in survey d are quasi - random : the pointings are the same as with survey a , but each has a random offset within [ -0.375,0.375 ]  deg applied in both the @xmath107 and @xmath108 directions . by fixing the pointings within these @xmath111 boxes ,",
    "we ensure that the quasi random strategy has a uniform coverage of the field ; that is , the fluctuations in coverage are less than they would be in a poisson ( totally random ) process .",
    "the orientations of the pointings in survey d are completely random",
    ".    surveys a and c can be executed without rotating the camera with respect to the celestial coordinates .",
    "surveys b and d can only be executed with systems that permit rotations of the camera .",
    "the iterative self - calibration procedure converges to a final fitted solution for the survey b , c and d catalogs . with the survey a catalog it does not converge in any reasonable time period , even when the system is started close to the optimum fit .",
    "the fitted instrument response solutions from the surveys a to d catalogs are shown in figures [ fig : a_result ] to [ fig : d_result ] . in these plots",
    "the final fitted instrument response @xmath100 is compared to the true instrument response @xmath96 and to the best possible instrument response fit with the basis used @xmath101 ( `` best - in - basis '' ) .",
    "the accuracy of the final fitted solutions are summarized , with the metrics introduced in section [ sec : metrics ] , for each of the survey strategies in table [ tab : simple_results ] .",
    "the survey strategies , the resultant sky coverages and the errors in final self - calibration flux solutions are summarized for each survey individually in figures [ fig : a_survey ] to [ fig : d_survey ] . with surveys",
    "a and b  and to a lesser extent survey c  the imprint of the strategies can be clearly seen in the coverage maps .",
    "it is important to note that  with sufficient re - visits to the field ",
    "the coverage of the quasi - random survey d is more uniform than the other strategies investigated .",
    "the self - calibration procedure performs best with the survey c and survey d catalogs .",
    "the performance of the self - calibration procedure is worse for the survey b catalog and it fails completely with the survey a catalog , where no solution was obtained .",
    "the number of iterations of the self - calibration procedure required to converge to the final solution also decreases as the quality of the final fit increases : survey d required 11 iterations , survey c 24 , survey b 1,114 and the procedure was iterated 5,000 times with survey a without reaching a solution .    with the survey c and d catalogs ,",
    "the instrument response is accurately recovered . as can be seen from figures [ fig : c_result ] and [ fig : d_result ] ( top )",
    ", the fitted instrument response @xmath100 does not perfectly reproduce the true instrument response @xmath96 .",
    "that said , through comparisons with the best fit possible with the eight order polynomial basis used in the self - calibration procedure @xmath101 ( bottom ) , we find that majority of the remaining errors in our fits are due to limitations in the model basis used .",
    "the residuals in this comparison are low ; this can also be clearly seen in the significant improvement in the best - in - basis badness @xmath99 compared to the true badness @xmath95 .",
    "the results from these two survey catalogs are clear : if the correct redundancy is built into the survey , then self - calibration calibration can be used to accurately constrain the relative instrument response , with presumably the majority of the remaining errors coming from the limitations in the model used to represent the instrument response",
    ".    surveys c and d perform comparably well , although they are very different in their configuration .",
    "two substantial advantages of survey c over survey d are : in survey c the camera would not need to be rotated relative to the sky between pointings ; indeed many survey imaging cameras have fixed celestial orientations .",
    "survey d requires generating quasi - random numbers , whereas survey c has a completely deterministic set of pointing centers .",
    "this is a conceptual advantage to survey c , but possibly also an operational advantage .",
    "the survey a and b catalogs also give interesting results . with survey",
    "a , the self - calibration procedure did not reach a solution .",
    "this  in itself  is an important result , as the naive tiling of the sky currently being considered for many large surveys will result in catalogs that can not be retrospectively self - calibrated .",
    "minor changes to survey strategies , such as those in survey c , can drastically improve the performance of the self - calibration procedure . without these changes ,",
    "vast amounts of calibration information is simply lost .",
    "we can also draw conclusions from the results obtained with survey b : here the self - calibration procedure converges close to the correct solutions , albeit not as close as the surveys c and d. here , it is the quality of the fit over the focal plane that is interesting . from the residual plot against the best - in - basis instrument response @xmath101 ( figure [ fig : b_result]d ) , we can see that the quality of the fit is rotationally symmetric , with the self - calibration procedure able to fit the instrument response well at the edge of the focal plane , but poorly at the center . as a result , the fluxes of the sources that fall at the center of the focal plane during a measurement can not be constrained as well as those that fall at the edges ; this can clearly be seen in the post - self - calibration flux error map shown in figure [ fig : b_survey]d .",
    "this , along with the success of the procedure with the surveys c and d catalogs , gives an insight into the key property of a survey that makes it good for self - calibration .",
    "namely , the survey should return the same sources to many , very different focal - plane positions .",
    "this allows the self - calibration procedure to link the different parts of the focal plane with each other through the observations of the same sources .",
    "surveys c and d do this , and the self - calibration procedure performs well with their catalogs . survey",
    "a does not do this ; it only connects the outer edges of the focal plane to each other .",
    "there are no redundant measurements connecting the majority of the focal plane to other positions .",
    "this conclusion in confirmed with strategy b. here , positions at the outside of the focal plane are well connected to other positions , and therefore the self - calibration procedure can well fit the instrument response in these regions . in the center of the focal plane , on which the same sources always fall , there are insufficient redundant measurements to allow for a good fit .",
    "returning the same sources to very different focal - plane positions is critical for the self - calibration to work effectively .",
    "from the simulations presented in this paper , we are able to draw two firm conclusions about the self - calibration of large - scale imaging surveys .",
    "the first is that , in agreement with previous work , we show that this technique is very powerful , allowing the large - scale , relative instrument response of an imaging instrument to be accurately retrospectively constrained from the science images alone .",
    "the second is that there must be the correct redundancy built into the survey strategy .",
    "the same sources must be imaged at very different focal - plane positions ; regular tiling of the sky is useless for this kind of calibration .    as this work",
    "was completed in the context of space - based imaging surveys , we have not considered the temporal variation of the relative instrument response as a high priority .",
    "we concede that this will have a significant impact on ground - based surveys , where variations on nightly timescales can be expected . the self - calibration procedure discussed in this paper",
    "can be trivially modified to fit for a time evolving relative instrument response model . for this to be effective though",
    ", it will be necessary to not only observe the same sources at very different focal - plane positions , but also to observe them at very different times within the survey .    in this paper",
    ", we have considered the design of survey strategies for calibrating the large - scale , relative photometric response of an instrument , but there are many more calibration parameters that can be constrained from this method .",
    "for example , the optical distortion of an instrument or the point - spread - function variation could also be constrained with such a method , although it would need to be explored whether the properties of a survey strategy that makes it good for one calibration , are also suitable for other calibration aspects .",
    "ultimately , survey design requires trade - offs between calibration requirements and other requirements related to cadence , telescope overheads , and observing constraints ( like alt , az , airmass , and field - rotation constraints ) .",
    "one requirement that is often over - emphasized , however , is conceptual or apparent `` uniformity '' ; these different survey strategies have different uniformities of coverage , each with possibly non - obvious consequences",
    ". many astronomers will see survey strategy a as being `` more uniform '' in its coverage ( especially relative to strategy d ) .",
    "this is not true , if uniformity is defined by the variance or skewness or any other simple statistic in exposure times ; strategy d is extremely uniform ( more uniform than poisson , for example ) . in any survey ,",
    "past and future , variations in exposure time have been valuable for checking systematic and random errors , and dont  in themselves ",
    "make it difficult to obtain a uniform survey in properties like brightness ( since samples can be cut on any well - measured property ) .",
    "in general , in the presence of real astronomical variations in distributions of luminosity , distance , metallicity , and ( more importantly ) extinction by dust , there is no way to make a survey uniformly sensitive to the objects of interest . as a community we should be prepared to adjust our analysis for the non - uniformity of the survey rather than adjust ( cut ) our data to match the uniformity of unrealistically simplified analyses .",
    "this is already standard practice in the precise cosmological measurement experiments , and will be required practice for the next generation of massively - multiple - epoch imaging surveys .",
