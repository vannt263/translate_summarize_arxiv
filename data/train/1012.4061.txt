    "an example of the time evolution pattern is shown in figure  [ fig02 ] .",
    "the consecutive balls behave like solitons in the kdv equation . furthermore ,",
    "when we denote by @xmath7 the number of arclines drawn in the first step of the updating rule , by @xmath8 one in the second step and so on , we obtain a nonincreasing integer sequence @xmath9 , which is a conserved quantity of the bbs in time@xcite .    .",
    ") ]        the reason why the bbs has these solitonic properties is understood by the fact that is obtained from the kdv equation through a limiting procedure , ultradiscretization@xcite .",
    "the process involved in obtaining from the kdv equation can be explained as follows .",
    "the integrable discrete kdv equation is given in the bilinear form as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a discretization parameter@xcite . by putting @xmath13",

    "recently , has been studied without the constraint of binary values@xcite .",
    "one interesting feature in this extension is that there exist background solutions composed of so - called negative solitons travelling at speed one@xcite .",
    "a typical example of the background solutions is shown in figure  [ fig03 ] .",
    "furthermore , such negative solitons interact nontrivially with ordinary solitons as shown in figure  [ fig04 ] . a method to solve the initial value problem for this generalized situation",
    "is given in ref.@xcite . from these properties ,",
    "the dynamical systems described by in the general setting are also regarded as integrable cellular automata , just as the bbs .",
    "however , several important features of integrable cellular automata have not been clarified yet , such as the conserved quantities , the relation to integrable lattice models , extension to the case of a cyclic boundary condition and so on , all of which are well understood in the case of bbs . in this article , we report that a simple transformation reveals the underlying integrable structure of for the generalized states . by this transformation ,",
    "the relation to the bbs and hence to the integrable lattice models , and generalization to a different boundary condition become apparent .",
    "we explicitly show how to obtain the conserved quantities and give the expression of general solutions to where negative solitons and ordinary solitons coexist .",
    "we start from the ultradiscretization of the coupled equations and . by putting @xmath25 and assuming that the limit @xmath26 exist",
    ", we obtain the equations @xmath27 , \\label{combinatorialr1 } \\\\ v_{n+1}^t&=u_n^t+v_n^t - u_n^{t+1}. \\label{combinatorialr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we impose the boundary condition @xmath28 , eqs . and are equivalent to .",
    "it is easily seen that and are generalized by introducing a positive integer constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 as @xmath31-\\min\\left[u_n^t , c - v_n^t \\right ] , \\label{carrierr1 } \\\\ v_{n+1}^t&=u_n^t+v_n^t - u_n^{t+1}. \\label{carrierr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations and are known as the ultradiscrete limit of the modified kdv equation and are interpreted as a bbs of box capacity @xmath29 with carrier of capacity @xmath30 @xcite . at the same time , they represent the action of the combinatorial r - matrix of an @xmath32 crystal on a certain symmetric tensor product representation as long as @xmath33 and @xmath34@xcite . note that eqs . and",
    "are closed under the values @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "hence the time evolution patterns of the bbs are regarded as the ground states of a 2 dimensional integrable lattice model at temperature 0 and its generalization has been investigated in detail@xcite .",
    "when we allow @xmath3 or @xmath35 in and to take negative integer values and/or the values greater than @xmath29 or @xmath30 respectively , they are no longer interpreted as a bbs nor as a realization of the combinatorial r - matrix . for an arbitrary initial state including negative integer values , let @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "when we change variables @xmath37 , then we find that eqs . and are unchanged under this gauge transformation@xcite , that is , @xmath38-\\min\\left[\\tilde{u}_n^t,\\tilde{c}-\\tilde{v}_n^t\\right],\\\\ \\tilde{v}_{n+1}^t&=\\tilde{u}_n^t+\\tilde{v}_n^t-\\tilde{u}_n^{t+1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since these equations are closed under the values @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and initial values @xmath41 belong to the same sets , we can regard them as equations for a bbs with box capacity @xmath42 and carrier capacity @xmath43 , and regard them as a realization of @xmath32 crystal lattice composed of a larger tensor product representation .",
    "thus we can conclude that eqs . and as well as eqs . and do not change their mathematical structure even in the case where the dependent variable take negative integer values .    from the above argument",
    ", we find that we can identify the ultradiscrete kdv equation as a bbs with larger box capacity when its dependent variables take negative integer values .",
    "the conserved quantities of the bbs have been widely investigated in general cases and we can apply the results to this system@xcite . in @xcite , it is shown that the energy functions which are combinatorially determined , are conserved in time , and in @xcite the path description for the conserved quantities is given . here",

    "2 .   @xmath55 ( mod @xmath56 ) .",
    "no vacancy in the @xmath49th box is connected by an arcline in the first step of the construction of the conserved quantities which we explain below .",
    "the conditions 2 , 3 are used to avoid the redundancy of the definition of conserved quantities . for the time step @xmath5 , from the boundary condition",
    ", there exists two integers @xmath57 such that @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 @xmath62 ) .",
    "furthermore we impose the following conditions on them .",
    "@xmath63 at each times step @xmath5 , we consider the boxes with indices from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "in other words , we neglect all the balls in the boxes @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "then , as in the case of the bbs with box capacity one , we draw arclines from balls to vacancies to determine the values of the conserved quantities .",
    "( see figure  [ fig05 ] . )    * draw an arcline from one of the leftmost balls to one of its nearest right vacancies . *",
    "draw an arcline from one of the leftmost balls which are located on the right of the vacancy we have drawn the arcline to one of its nearest right vacancies .",
    "* repeat the above procedure until one has drawn arclines between all the pairs of balls and vacancies .",
    "note that if we drew an arcline to a vacancy at @xmath4th box , then the ball from which we draw an arcline in the next step is located in the box whose index is greater than @xmath4 , and that there must be no arcline starting from a ball in the last box due to the condition 3 .",
    "let @xmath68 be the number of arclines drawn in this step .",

    "is the direct consequence of the fact that @xmath86 is equal to the number of balls moved by the carrier with capacity @xmath87 at one time step which is the value of @xmath87th energy function@xcite .",
    "here we map the system to the bbs with box capacity @xmath88 in which the number of balls is finite , that is , the @xmath4th box is vacant for @xmath59 and @xmath89 . of course we can make another choice",
    "we could impose the condition @xmath90 ( mod @xmath56 ) or the condition that a vacancy in the @xmath49th box is connected by an arcline in the first step .",
    "this redundancy is caused by the fact that there are essentially four types of finite systems which are equivalent to this system .",
    "once we determine the type however , the sequence @xmath91 does not depend on @xmath65 and @xmath64 as long as they are sufficiently large and , when there is no negative soliton @xmath92 @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the @xmath72th conserved quantity defined in the original bbs .",
    "for the original bbs where every box capacity is one and only a finite number of balls exist , all the solutions are proved to be constructed by ultradiscretization from the soliton solutions of the discrete kdv equation @xcite .",
    "although the ultradiscrete kdv equation over arbitrary integers is shown to be equivalent to the bbs with larger box capacity , the solutions to them can not be the ultradiscrete limit of soliton solutions to , because the boundary condition of the bbs changes such that the number of balls becomes @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
