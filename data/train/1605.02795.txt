    "in this paper we study the derived category of a quadric ( and its noncommutative analogues ) in relationship with the derived category of the hilbert scheme of two points on a quadric ( and commutative deformations thereof ) .",
    "the motivation comes from several seemingly disparate observations .",
    "first of all let  @xmath0 be a smooth projective surface ( over an algebraically closed field  @xmath1 throughout ) .",
    "then it is a classical result of fogarty that the hilbert scheme of  @xmath2 points  @xmath3 is again a smooth projective variety , of dimension  @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "if we moreover assume that  @xmath5 ( e.g.  @xmath0 is a rational surface , such as a quadric ) then krug  sosna @xcite have proven that the fourier ",
    "mukai functor @xmath6 is a fully faithful functor , where  @xmath7 is the ideal sheaf for the universal family  @xmath8 .",
    "another piece of motivation stems from the notion of geometric dg  categories as introduced by orlov @xcite .",
    "he shows that any dg  category whose homotopy category has a full exceptional collection can be embedded in ( an enhancement of ) the derived category of a smooth projective variety .",
    "this construction can be applied to the full exceptional collection describing the derived category of a quadric surface , but the resulting variety is constructed using iterated projective bundles and does not seem to have a geometric interpretation in terms of a moduli problem , unlike the embedding .",
    "it is interesting to try and apply orlov s algorithm to a dg  category with a full exceptional collection which is not of geometric origin .",
    "this brings us to the final piece of motivation : deformations of abelian categories . in noncommutative algebraic geometry",
    "a central role is played by abelian categories and their derived categories , and there is a framework for describing the deformations of abelian categories @xcite , so in particular it can be applied to  @xmath9 .",
    "the quadric is easily seen to be rigid ( i.e.  @xmath10 ) , but its category of coherent sheaves has nontrivial deformations ( @xmath11 is  10-dimensional ) , which can be seen as deformations of  @xmath12 in the noncommutative direction .    because the quadric has a strongly ample sequence it is moreover possible to pass from infinitesimal deformations to formal deformations @xcite , and the theory has been worked out in detail in @xcite .",
    "a noncommutative quadric is an abelian category  @xmath13 , which is a certain quotient category of the category of graded modules for a ( generalized ) graded algebra  @xmath14 satisfying some natural conditions . on the derived level it is possible to view a family of noncommutative quadrics by varying the relations in the quiver coming from the full and strong exceptional collection @xcite . for these new exceptional collections it makes sense to apply orlov s embedding result , but",
    "again the result is an iterated projective bundle construction where arbitrary choices have been made and there is no moduli interpretation .    yet for  @xmath15 ( and its noncommutative deformations ) orlov shows that there exists an embedding in ( a commutative deformation of )  @xmath16 @xcite , hence there _ is _ a moduli interpretation for the derived category of the finite - dimensional algebras whose structure resembles that of the belinson quiver for  @xmath15 .    in this paper",
    "we obtain a result analogous to orlov s for noncommutative quadrics .",
    "the following is a compressed version of [ theorem : noncommutative - embedding ] and is our main result .",
    "[ theorem : main - theorem - compressed ] for a generic noncommutative quadric  @xmath14 there exists a deformation  @xmath17 of  @xmath18 and a fully faithful embedding @xmath19    to prove this result we need an explicit geometric model for  @xmath18 , which we give in [ theorem : description - h ] . in [ subsection : geometric - squares ] we explain how this geometric model depends on so called geometric squares : linear algebra data that describes the composition law in the derived category . in [ subsection : noncommutative - quadrics ] it is shown how a sufficiently generic noncommutative quadric gives rise to such a geometric square , and indeed to an embedding as in [ theorem : main - theorem - compressed ] .",
    "note that there exists a notion of hilbert scheme of points for a general cubic artin ",
    "schelter regular graded algebra @xcite , which is a subset of all noncommutative quadrics .",
    "we do not address the comparison between these moduli spaces and the deformations constructed in this paper .",
    "we also formulate a general question regarding limited functoriality of hochschild cohomology and the hochschild  kostant  rosenberg decomposition , motivated by a conjecture of orlov .",
    "this is done in [ section : remarks ] .",
    "we discuss some evidence suggesting an interesting relationship between the hochschild cohomology of a surface and the hochschild cohomology of the hilbert scheme of points , showing that the results in this paper hint towards a much more general picture .",

    "this embedding can be explicitly described as follows : a  @xmath60 ( i.e. a linear functional  @xmath61 ) determines a linear map  @xmath62 , which is just contraction by  @xmath63 , defining a closed point of  @xmath64 .",

    "the infinitesimal deformation theory of abelian categories is governed by their hochschild cohomology @xcite , and one has the hochschild  kostant  rosenberg decomposition for hochschild cohomology of smooth varieties . in particular",
    "there is the decomposition @xmath316 where the first term can be understood as the noncommutative deformations , the second as the commutative ( or geometric ) deformations and the third one corresponding to gerby deformations @xcite .",
    "the natural categorical framework for hochschild cohomology is that of dg  categories .",
    "it is easily checked that hochschild cohomology is not functorial for arbitrary functors : it only satisfies a limited functoriality .",
