    "investigations of the dense molecular interstellar medium ( ism ) in high  redshift galaxies are of fundamental importance to further our understanding of the early phases of galaxy formation and evolution , as it harbors the environments in which the actual star formation is believed to occur .",
    "recent studies of the molecular gas phase in high@xmath5 galaxies using co emission lines have revealed large molecular gas reservoirs with masses in excess of 10@xmath9(see review by solomon & vanden bout @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "however , while the relative brightness of co emission lines renders this molecule the most common tracer of the requisite material for star formation , the low densities of only @xmath10@xmath2 required to excite its lower@xmath11 transitions ( due to its low dipole moment of only @xmath12 ) imply that co is not a specific tracer of dense molecular cloud cores , i.e. , the regions where stars are actively formed .",
    "in contrast , recent studies of nearby actively star  forming galaxies have shown that the high dipole molecule hcn ( @xmath13 ) is a far better tracer of such dense molecular cores ( e.g.  gao & solomon @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the critical density of @xmath14@xmath2 to collisionally thermalize its lower@xmath11 transitions is much higher than that of co , and of the same order as the densities found in bright star  forming regions in the galaxy ( e.g.  the orion bar , hogerheijde et al .",
    "a main result in this context is the finding that the hcn luminosity correlates well with the far  infrared ( fir ) luminosities ( which is commonly used to estimate star ",
    "formation rates at high redshift ) over 78 orders of magnitude , from galactic dense cores to the highest redshift quasars ( wu et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "however , in nearby luminous and ultra  luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs / ulirgs ) , it has been found that systems with similar hcn / co and hcn / fir luminosity ratios may have quite different dense gas properties regarding their chemical composition , and their gas excitation ( e.g. , aalto et al .",
    "@xcite ) . to better understand the physical and chemical state of the dense molecular gas phase which directly relates to star formation , it has proven essential to study additional bright tracers of dense gas with properties different from hcn , such as the cyanide radical ( cn ) . due to its lower dipole moment",
    "relative to hcn ( @xmath15 ) , its critical density is lower by about a factor of 5 . observations of cn emission toward the orion a molecular cloud complex have shown that cn filaments trace the dense interfaces between the molecular cloud and the major ionization fronts ( rodrguez  franco et al .",
    "it has also been found that the [ cn]/[hcn ] abundance ratio is greatly enhanced in the central region of the starburst galaxy m82 , being as high as @xmath165 across the entire nucleus ( fuente et al .",
    "these observations indicate that cn is a good tracer of gas layers which are affected by photochemistry , since this molecule appears to be predominantly found in regions exposed to ionizing stellar uv radiation .",
    "it has also been found that , due to the rapid destruction of other dense gas tracers like hcn , the abundance of cn tends to be enhanced in areas where the uv radiation field is only partly attenuated , such as in zones close to the surface of photodissociation regions ( pdrs , fuente et al.@xcite ; sternberg & dalgarno @xcite ; jansen et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the cn / hcn intensity ratio can thus be used as a diagnostic for the relative importance of pdrs in a source , and a sensitive probe of optical depth , the radiation field , and photochemical processes ( e.g. , boger & sternberg @xcite ) .",
    "cn emission may thus in a sense be a more specific tracer for star formation than , e.g. , hcn , which only traces regions of dense gas in general .",
    "in addition , theoretical studies of the chemical composition of molecular gas for different ionization parameters suggest that the relative abundance of cn may also be enhanced in x  ray dominated regions ( xdrs ) , such as agn environments ( lepp & dalgarno @xcite ) .",
    "this exemplifies why it is desirable to search for cn emission , which is part of our current effort to study molecular tracers other than co out to high redshifts .",
    "such an investigation is imperative to obtain more meaningful constraints on the physical properties and chemical composition of the dense molecular ism in distant galaxies .    in this paper , we report the first high@xmath5 detection of emission , which was observed towards the cloverleaf quasar ( @xmath0 ) with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) . due to its strong gravitational magnification ( magnification factor @xmath17 , venturini & solomon @xcite ) , the cloverleaf is the brightest co source at high redshift ( e.g. , barvainis et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and one of the most prolific sources of molecular lines beyond @xmath5=2 .",
    "it was the first @xmath18 source to be detected in hcn ( solomon  @xcite ) and hco@xmath8 ( riechers et al .",

    "we observed the  transition line ( @xmath23ghz for the different fine structure [ fs ] and hyperfine structure [ hfs ] transitions of the @xmath24=0 vibrational state ) towards h1413 + 117 ( the cloverleaf quasar ) using the pdbi in d configuration between 2006 july 26 and september 03 . at the target redshift of @xmath5=2.55784 ( wei  @xcite ) ,",
    "the line is shifted to @xmath1695.6ghz ( 3.14 mm ) .",
    "the total integration time amounts to 17.5hr using 5 antennas , resulting in 5.8hr equivalent on  source time with 6 antennas after discarding unusable visibility data .",
    "the nearby sources 1354 + 195 and 1502 + 106 ( distance to the cloverleaf : @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) were observed every 20 minutes for pointing , secondary amplitude and phase calibrations . for primary flux calibration , several nearby calibrators ( mwc349 , crl618 ,",

    "it also covers enough channels that are free of line emission to constrain the 3 mm continuum emission of the cloverleaf .    for data reduction and analysis ,",
    "the iram gildas package was used .",
    "all data were mapped using the clean algorithm and natural weighting without applying a further taper ; this results in a synthesized beam of 5.3@xmath36@xmath374.9@xmath36 ( @xmath1642kpc at @xmath5 = 2.56 ) .",

    "this separation is of the same order as the kinematical broadening of the co lines in the cloverleaf ( wei  et al .",
    "@xcite ) , causing the hfs components to be blended . to analyze the intrinsic line shape of the  transition in the cloverleaf , we calculated a synthetic line profile , assuming optically thin emission in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) to derive the relative intensities of the hfs components .",
    "the relative intensities of the components were computed using the laboratory data from skatrud et al.(@xcite ) , and approximation ( 4 ) of equation ( 1 ) of pickett et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . assuming that the 3 main  components are kinematically broadened in the same way as the co lines ( 416 @xmath6 6  fwhm ; see wei  et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we obtain the synthetic line profile displayed in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ( solid line ) . under the given assumptions ,",
    "the contribution from all hfs lines of component 1 to the total intensity are negligible , and not detectable at the given signal  to  noise ( see below ) .",
    "a single gaussian fit ( dotted line , 484  fwhm , or 116% of the co lines ) agrees with the more detailed model profile ( solid line ) within a few percent in its peak position and integral , i.e. , well within the observational errors .",
    "note however that the width and peak position of this gaussian depends on the relative intensities of the hfs components , which in turn depend on the above assumptions , in particular the optical depth . in the optically thin lte case ,",
    "components 2 and 3 have a peak strength ratio of 1:1.4 . as an example , if they had a ratio of unity , the fitted gaussian to the line profile would have a fwhm of 603 , or 145% of the co lines .",
    "we thus conclude that fitting a gaussian to the observed line profile contains all relevant information , while minimizing the number of free fit parameters , and thus is preferred over a more complex fitting procedure to describe and analyze the  profile at the given signal  to  noise ratio .",

    ", we derive a line peak flux density of 1.94 @xmath6 0.24mjy beam@xmath20 , and a line fwhm of 666 @xmath6 97 .",
    "the fit provides an upper limit for the continuum emission at the line frequency of @xmath460.25mjy . from the channels assumed to be free of line emission , we derive a formal 3@xmath45 upper limit to the continuum peak flux density of 0.7mjy beam@xmath20 .",
    "note that the model fit to the dust sed of the cloverleaf by wei  et al.(@xcite ) would suggest a continuum flux of @xmath160.3mjy at the  line frequency , which agrees within the errors with the above estimates .",
    "as the continuum however is not detected , we do not subtract a continuum component from the observed spectrum .",
    "this leads to an integrated  line flux of 1.37 @xmath6 0.17jy .",
    "the velocity offset of the gaussian peak relative to the tuning frequency is -105 @xmath6 38 .",
    "the fwhm of the gaussian fit to the  emission line suggests that its components 2 and 3 have similar peak strengths ( different from 1:1.4 as predicted for the optically thin lte case ; fig .",

    "it may thus be possible that the two brightest hfs complexes ( components 2 and 3 ) are detected individually , but observations at higher signal  to  noise are needed to confirm this result . in any case",

    ", this would mean that cn emission in the cloverleaf is slightly brighter than that from the other high density probes hcn and hco@xmath8 .",

    ". this may indicate a higher relative filling factor of cn relative to hcn and hco@xmath8 , or even a relatively high chemical abundance of cn .",

    "figure  [ f5]a shows that @xmath59 correlates closely with @xmath57 ; a linear least squares fit to all galaxies ( excluding the cloverleaf ) yields log@xmath60 .",
    "this slope may suggest a trend of decreasing cn / fir luminosity ratio towards higher luminosities ( see also aalto et al .",
    "it however also is consistent with unity within the statistical uncertainties ( which are quite large due to the limited sample size ) and systematical errors ( e.g. , different beam sizes for cn line and ir continuum observations ) , and thus with cn being a valuable tracer of star formation .",

    "_ figure 5c _ : assuming that cn traces the uv field ( which falls off rapidly with growing distance from star  forming regions , or an active galactic nucleus ) , while hcn traces dense gas in general , it would be expected that the hcn / cn ratio stays constant or decreases with increasing @xmath57 . in this scenario , a decrease in the hcn / cn ratio would correspond to an increase in the filling factor of uv  illuminated clouds with @xmath57 .",

    "chemical models suggest that cn is produced quite efficiently in the presence of a strong uv field , which also leads to an enhanced ionization rate ( boger & sternberg @xcite ) .",
    "the large observed [ cn]/[hcn ] abundance ratio of @xmath165 toward the molecular disk of m82 may be indicative of a large dense pdr bathed in the intense radiation field of the starburst environment ( fuente et al.@xcite ) , lending observational support to these models .",
    "other models suggest that the relative abundance of cn may also be enhanced in regions with elevated x  ray ionization rates , such as agn environments ( lepp & dalgarno @xcite ; meijerink & spaans @xcite ) . especially in the cloverleaf , where the central quasar is known to contribute a significant fraction to the heating of the gas and dust ( wei  et al .",
    "@xcite ; solomon et al.@xcite ) , such a scenario would appear reasonable and may explain the relatively high brightness of cn compared to other dense gas tracers in the cloverleaf .",
    "however , note that in fig .  5c , the pure starburst galaxies show the brightest cn emission relative to hcn , and galaxies with a relatively strong agn like mrk231 and ngc6240 have some of the highest @xmath56/@xmath59 ratios .",
    "this may indicate that the strength of the uv field in a starburst environment has a significantly greater impact on the global gas  phase production rate of cn in a galaxy than the strength of the x  ray field , lending further support to the supposition that cn is a good star formation tracer .",
    "we thus conclude that the xdr scenario alone does not explain the observed dense gas properties of the ( u)lirgs shown in fig .  5 without any further assumptions .",
    "overall , the cloverleaf follows the @xmath59@xmath57 relation as defined by nearby galaxies of different types remarkably well , and extends this relation to higher luminosities .",
    "this relation now appears to hold over almost 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "if these findings were to hold for other distant quasars , cn would be an excellent probe of dense molecular environments out to high redshifts .",

    "this may prove to be of particular importance for future high@xmath5 studies with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , which will offer the opportunity to probe to fainter galaxy populations in general , but will also be restricted to the higher  order transitions of the most common dense molecular gas tracers ( typically 3@xmath72 and higher at @xmath18 ) .",

    "<S> we report the detection of  emission towards the cloverleaf quasar ( @xmath0 ) based on observations with the iram plateau de bure interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first clear detection of emission from this radical at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> cn emission is a tracer of dense molecular hydrogen gas ( @xmath1@xmath2 ) within star  forming molecular clouds , in particular in regions where the clouds are affected by uv radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the hcn / cn intensity ratio can be used as a diagnostic for the relative importance of photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) in a source , and as a sensitive probe of optical depth , the radiation field , and photochemical processes . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a lensing  corrected  line luminosity of @xmath3k pc@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio between cn luminosity and far  infrared luminosity falls within the scatter of the same relationship found for low@xmath5 ( ultra ) luminous infrared galaxies . combining our new results with  and  measurements from the literature and assuming thermal excitation for all transitions , we find a co / cn luminosity ratio of 9.3 @xmath6 1.9 and a hcn / cn luminosity ratio of 0.95 @xmath6 0.15 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the  line is likely only subthermally excited , implying that those ratios may only provide upper limits for the intrinsic 1@xmath70 line luminosity ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , in combination with other molecular gas tracers like co , hcn , and hco@xmath8 , cn is an important probe of the physical conditions and chemical composition of dense molecular environments at high redshift . </S>"
