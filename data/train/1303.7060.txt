    "two of the most intriguing puzzles in the study of high @xmath1 cuprates are the unexpected non - bcs behavior and the non - quasiparticle nature in the superconducting states and the normal states , respectively @xcite . to resolve those puzzles , the relevant low energy physics based on the projection out of the degrees of freedom at high energy",
    "must be embedded in a doped mott insulator @xcite .",
    "the gutzwiller - projected bcs wave function is the appropriate description of the superconducting state in cuprates @xcite , while strong correlations make theoretical approaches extremely difficult .",
    "however , based on the framework of the gutzwiller - projected states , the issues related to the finite - temperature physics of cuprates are still unclear @xcite .",
    "therefore , the first step in studying the excitations is to understand the structure of low - lying quasiparticle excitations .",
    "it has been experimentally observed that the low - lying excitations of superconducting cuprates resemble bcs bogoliubov s quasiparticles ( bqp ) @xcite .",
    "also , many theoretical studies on the gutzwiller - projected bqp ( gbqp ) excitations have been presented few years ago @xcite .",
    "the ansatz used for the gbqp excited states is based on the success of the gutzwiller - projected bcs wave function . owing to exact diagonalization results indicating the well defined bcs - like bqp as low - energy excitations of the @xmath2 model @xcite , the gbqp excited state given in eq.([e : equ3 ] )",
    "is expected to be a simply renormalized bqp excitation despite lack of analytical proof .",
    "relied on the careful fitting simulations @xcite , we found they are quantitatively satisfied with the renormalized bqp picture .",
    "even so , we still have no knowledge of the exact gutzwiller - projected quasiparticles ( gqp ) .",
    "on the other hand , to explain some unusual features seen by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) in cuprates , the extension beyond the single - mode approach has also been studied @xcite . therefore , from a theoretical point of view , the difference between gbqp excitations and gqp excitations should be clarified .",
    "let us briefly summarize the key messages involved in this article .",
    "we begin by detailing the procedure that constructs the two - particle excitations by using the usual gbqp picture and the gqp excitations in the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculation .",
    "we demonstrate the projected two - particle excitation is reasonable to be constructed by applying bqp operators to strongly correlated superconducting ground states .",
    "it is noticed that there is the discrepancy between gqp and gbqp near antinodal regions .",
    "this discrepancy arising from a close relation between gutzwiller s projection and @xmath0-wave pairing may provide a clue to the causes of the nodal - antinodal dichotomy observed by arpes measurements @xcite .",
    "let us begin by @xmath3 where the hopping @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 for sites i and j being the nearest , second - nearest , and third - nearest neighbors , respectively .",
    "other notations are standard .",
    "we restrict the electron creation operators @xmath7 to the subspace without doubly - occupied sites . in the following ,",
    "the bare parameters in the hamiltonian are set to be @xmath8 .",
    "two holes are doped into the extended @xmath9 model in @xmath10 lattice .",
    "the well - known candidate for the ground state @xcite is the @xmath0-wave resonating - valence - bond ( @xmath0-rvb ) wave function with jastrow factors of the form @xmath11 where the coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the bcs coherence factors .",
    "the trial wave function has three projections : @xmath14 to fix the number of electrons @xmath15 , the gutzwiller projector @xmath16 to enforce no - doubly - occupied sites , and charge - charge jastrow factors @xmath17 to repel neighboring holes ( see the details in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is not shown that the conclusions in this work would not be changed by @xmath17 , and hence we will ignore the charge - charge jastrow factors in the following .",
    "even so , it is still not easy to construct the single - particle excited state of the extended @xmath2 hamiltonian in the canonical ensemble . based on eq.([e : equ2 ] ) , however , the simplest way is to define a single - particle excitation under gutzwiller s projection as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the creation of the bqp and @xmath20 spin index ( @xmath21 ) . in",
    "what follows , to avoid the confusion due to mixing hilbert space of different particle numbers , we introduce the partial particle - hole transformation to change the representation from ( c ) to ( df ) @xcite : @xmath22 two different particles , @xmath0 and @xmath23 , are thus introduced instead of down- and up - spin electrons ( see the details in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we start from the wave function without gutzwiller s projection .",
    "first , the bcs wave function can be transformed into the representation ( df ) , @xmath24 @xmath25 in the representation ( df ) , the total particle number of the single - particle bcs excitation is no longer confused with @xmath26 or @xmath27 like eq.([e : equ3 ] ) in the representation ( c ) , but fixed to @xmath28 in eq.([e : equ6 ] ) and @xmath29 in eq.([e : equ7 ] ) .    on the other hand",
    ", we adopt the similar route to write down the two - particle bcs excitation @xmath30 in the representation ( df ) : @xmath31 according to the above equation , if we define two states @xmath32 and @xmath33 as @xmath34 respectively . owing to @xmath35 , eqs.([e : equ10 ] ) simply represent that both the bcs ground state and the first bcs excited state are able to be expanded by the two orthonormal states , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    applying the similar idea in the projected case",
    ", we can write down the @xmath0-rvb ground state and the corresponding first gqp excited state @xmath36 ( shown in eq.([e : equ15 ] ) ) by using the following two states : @xmath37 and @xmath38 given by @xmath39 ) to create two - particle gbqp excited state : @xmath40 some details in the vmc calculation should be noticed . to avoid the divergence from the nodes in the trial wave functions ,",
    "the boundary condition we use is the anti - periodic boundary condition along both x and y directions . in order to achieve a reasonable acceptance ratio",
    ", the simulations consist of a combination of one - particle moves and two - particle moves .",
    "variational parameters in the @xmath0-rvb state are optimized by using the stochastic reconfiguration method @xcite .",
    "all physical quantities are calculated with the optimized parameters .",
    "we also take a sufficient number of samples ( @xmath41 ) to reduce the statistical errors , and keep the sampling interval ( @xmath42 ) long enough to ensure statistical independence between samples .",
    "since the projections are included in eqs.([e : equ11 ] ) , the trial states @xmath37 and @xmath38 are no longer orthogonal . we need to diagonalize a @xmath43 hamiltonian matrix in the subspace spanned by eqs.([e : equ11 ] ) . in principle , we can reconstruct two orthogonal states , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , for each momentum by using gram - schmidt method . the hamiltonian matrix in this subspace is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 or @xmath23 .",
    "we further diagonalize @xmath49 to obtain the eigenstates @xmath50 and @xmath36 as a linear combination of @xmath44 and @xmath45 . without the projection , eq.([e : equ10 ] ) provides a route to construct the bcs ground state and the two - particle excited state by using a linear combination of two orthonormal states @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , we can expect the ground state @xmath50 and the gqp excited state @xmath36 should play the same role in the cases under the projection .",
    "a further question is whether the gbqp wave function @xmath51 mentioned above is appropriate to describe the two - particle excitation from the @xmath0-rvb state @xmath52 . in fig.[fig1](a ) , we compare the dispersion of four different states discussed above with @xmath51 .",
    "first , it is obvious that @xmath50 exactly reproduces the optimized energy of the @xmath0-rvb state indicated by the orange dashed line .",
    "based on this agreement , we are confident that @xmath36 should properly represent the two - particle gqp excitation .",
    "interestingly , except the deviation near the antinodal regions , the energy dispersion of @xmath36 coincides with @xmath51 very well .",
    "we shall return to this deviation in the following . here",
    "we see that @xmath51 has the lower energy than @xmath36 around the regions with large @xmath0-wave pairing amplitude .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the gqp excitation seems reasonable to be constructed by applying bqp operators to the @xmath0-rvb wave function although @xmath36 just represents the first two - particle gqp excited state .",
    "second , we notice that @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) shows dispersionless behavior inside ( outside ) the underlying fermi surface .",
    "this results can be easily understood by transforming the representation ( df ) back to ( c ) . in the original representation ( c ) , they are given by @xmath53 apparently , there is an additional electron ( hole ) pair in @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) so that it only can show the dispersion outside ( inside ) the underlying fermi surface in fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "next , we study the overlap between @xmath37 and @xmath38 shown in fig.[fig1](b ) .",
    "note that without the projection , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are orthogonal for every momentum . under the projection",
    "the overlap dramatically enhances near the antinodal regions .",
    "the shape of the overlap in the momentum space is very similar to the @xmath0-wave form factor , @xmath54 , and the maxima about @xmath55 right at antinodes .",
    "it can be easily understood from eq.([e : equ14 ] ) in the original representation ( c ) .",
    "since there is an extra cooper pair @xmath56 in the overlap , we can expect that gutzwiller s projection would influence the cooper pair following the @xmath0-wave symmetry in bcs wave functions .",
    "thus , we can further comprehend the deviation for the excitation energy near the antinodal regions in fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "furthermore , it is important to examine the details of the eigenstates @xmath57 .",
    "we can write down @xmath57 as a linear combination of the orthogonal states @xmath58 : @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be easily determined by diagonalizing eq.([e : equ13 ] ) . by using gram - schmidt method ,",
    "the two orthogonal states @xmath58 can be written as latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     thus , the eigenstates @xmath57 are expressed in terms of @xmath62 as well , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are related to @xmath65 and @xmath60 according to eq.([e : equ16 ] ) .",
    "note that the normalization condition guarantees @xmath66 but not necessary for @xmath67 and @xmath64 .    in order to understand how",
    "gutzwiller s projection affects the coherence factors in eq.([e : equ10 ] ) , we plot the comparison between the bcs coherence factors and the coefficients @xmath67 and @xmath64 in fig.[fig2](a ) .",
    "we should notice that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are obtained from the optimized variational parameters . to avoid the confusion arising from the sign of @xmath0-wave symmetry ,",
    "we show the absolute value of @xmath69 and @xmath67 . along the nodal direction ,",
    "interestingly , the projection seems not to change the bcs coherence factors .",
    "this may imply the intimate relation between gutzwiller s projection and the @xmath0-wave gap function .",
    "however , since the coefficients @xmath67 and @xmath64 are not normalized , there is a large enhancement for the first gqp excited state and small suppression for the @xmath0-rvb ground state around the antinodal parts . in fig.[fig2](b ) , we clearly demonstrate the shape of the coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath60 looks similar to the bcs coherence factors in spite of the existence of gutzwiller s projection",
    ". the crossing curve of @xmath65 and @xmath60 bends more like a hole pocket at @xmath70 , and however the bcs coherence factor displays a diamond - like underlying fermi surface ( not shown ) .",
    "even so , it is reasonable to believe that the gqps in the @xmath0-rvb wave function are still analogous to the bqp picture .",
    "in conclusions , we have developed a method to examine the idea of bqps in gutzwiller - projected bcs wave functions . by calculating the two - particle excitation dispersion using vmc approach ,",
    "the gqp excited states have been obtained .",
    "we have found the gbqp @xmath51 shows almost the same energy as the gqp @xmath36 except that gives the lower energy around the antinodal regime .",
    "the reason is that there exists large overlap between @xmath37 and @xmath38 near the antinodes , suggesting the intimate connection between gutzwiller s projection and @xmath0-wave cooper pairing .",
    "it also results in the deviation of the coefficients in @xmath57 from the bcs coherence factors , which might be related to the nodal - antinodal dichotomy observed in cuprates by arpes measurements .",
    "therefore , the lower energy around the antinodal regions implies the gbqp excited wave functions are suitable to describe the low - lying excitations in strongly correlated superconductors .",
