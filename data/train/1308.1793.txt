    "we assume that resonator @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is decoupled from the qutrit during each of the first ( second ) @xmath2 steps  due to large detunings , which can be achieved by prior adjustment of the resonator frequency .",
    "the effects of off - resonant qutrit - resonator couplings and classical drivings on the fidelity of the prepared state will be taken into account later .    before the operations for the first @xmath2 steps , we need to adjust the level spacings of the qutrit such that resonator @xmath22 is resonant with the @xmath11  transition , but is far off - resonant with ( decoupled from )  the @xmath16  transition so that the coupling between resonator @xmath22  and the @xmath23  transition  can be neglected [ fig .",
    "meanwhile , resonator @xmath21  is far off - resonant with both of these two transitions and thus it is unaffected during this interaction ( i.e. , resonator @xmath21 is decoupled from the qutrit ) . under these conditions ,",

    "the result ( 8) shows that the two resonators @xmath22  and @xmath21  are prepared in a noon state of photons , which are disentangled from the qutrit .",
    "previously we have assumed that during the first ( second ) @xmath2 steps of operations , the resonator @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is decoupled from the qutrit . in principle , this requirement can be met by adjusting the level spacings of the qutrit [ 41 - 43 ] or the resonator mode frequency such that the irrelevant resonator during the operation is highly detuned from the transition between any two levels of the coupler qutrit .",
    "the rapid tuning of cavity frequencies has been demonstrated in superconducting microwave cavities ( e.g. , in less than a few nanoseconds for a superconducting transmission line resonator [ 45 ] ) .",
    "as shown above , our noon - state preparation is based on the following approximations .",
    "for the first @xmath2 steps of operation , we have neglected the off - resonant interaction between resonator @xmath22 and the @xmath12 transition of the qutrit , the off - resonant interaction between the pulse and the @xmath12 transition of the qutrit , and the off - resonant coupling of resonator @xmath21 with the transition between any two levels of the qutrit . for the second @xmath2 steps of operation",

    "in addition , for each step of operation , there exists an inter - cavity cross coupling , which was also not considered in our noon - state preparation above . to quantify how well our protocol works out ,",
    "later we will perform a numerical simulation for @xmath105 by taking all these effects into account .    * experimental issues . * for the method to work the primary considerations shall be given to :    \\(i ) the total operation time @xmath106 given by @xmath107 ( where @xmath108 ns is the typical time required for adjusting the qutrit level spacings ) , needs to be much shorter than the energy relaxation time @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) and dephasing time @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) of the level @xmath5 ( @xmath113 ) of the qutrit@xmath114 such that decoherence caused by energy relaxation and dephasing of the qutrit is negligible for the operation .",
    "note that @xmath110 and @xmath115 of the qutrit are comparable to @xmath109 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "for instance , @xmath117 and @xmath118 for transmon qutrits .",

    "for the two resonators , the lifetime of entanglement of the resonator modes is given by @xmath125 which should be much longer than @xmath106 such that the effect of resonator decay is negligible during the operation .",
    "\\(iii ) the inter - cavity cross coupling between the two resonators is determined mostly by the coupling capacitance @xmath126 and the qutrit s self capacitance @xmath127 , because the * *  * * field leakage through space * *  * * is extremely low for high-@xmath128  resonators as long as the inter - cavity distance is much greater than transverse dimension of the cavities - a condition easily met in experiments for the two resonators .",

    "<S> the generation , manipulation and fundamental understanding of entanglement lies at very heart of quantum mechanics . among various types of entangled states , </S>",
    "<S> the noon states are a kind of special quantum entangled states with two orthogonal component states in maximal superposition , which have a wide range of potential applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing . here </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a fast and simple scheme for generating noon states of photons in two superconducting resonators by using a single superconducting transmon qutrit . because only one superconducting qutrit and two resonators are used , the experimental setup for this scheme is much simplified when compared with the previous proposals requiring a setup of two superconducting qutrits and three cavities . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this scheme is easier and faster to implement than the previous proposals , which require using a complex microwave pulse , or a small pulse rabi frequency in order to avoid nonresonant transitions .    </S>",

    "<S> superconducting qubits ( such as charge , flux , and transmon qubits ) behave as artificial atoms , they have relatively long decoherence times [ 3 - 7 ] , and various single- and multiple - qubit operations with state readout have been demonstrated [ 8 - 12 ] . on the other hand , a superconducting resonator provides a quantized cavity field which acts as a quantum bus and thus can mediate long - distance and strong interaction between distant superconducting qubits [ 13 - 15 ] . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the strong coupling between a microwave cavity and superconducting charge qubits [ 16 ] or flux qubits [ 17 ] was earlier predicated in theory and has been experimentally demonstrated [ 18,19 ] . because of these features , circuit qed has been widely utilized for quantum information processing . during the past decade , based on circuit qed , many theoretical proposals have been presented for the preparation of fock states , coherent states , squeezed states , schrdinger cat states , and arbitrary superpositions of fock states of a single superconducting resonator [ 20 - 22 ] . </S>",
    "<S> so far , fock states and their superpositions of a resonator have been experimentally produced by using a superconducting qubit [ 23 - 25 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> intense effort has been recently devoted to the preparation of entangled states of photons in two or more superconducting resonators [ 26 - 29 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the noon states are a special type of photonic entangled states with two orthogonal component states in maximal superposition , which play the crucial role in quantum optical lithography [ 30,31 ] , quantum metrology [ 32 - 35 ] , precision measurement of transmons [ 36 - 38 ] , and quantum information processing [ 39,40 ] .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 26 ] , a theoretical method for synthesizing an arbitrary quantum state of two superconducting resonators using a tunable superconducting qubit has been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> this method is based on alternative resonant interactions of the coupler qubit with two cavity modes and a classical pulse . as pointed out in [ 26 ] , the rabi frequency of the classical pulse needs to be much smaller than the photon - number - dependent stark shifts induced by dispersive interaction with the two field modes and , hence , the pulse can drive the qubit to undergo a rotation conditional upon the state of the cavity modes . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the time needed to complete the rotation in each step should be much ( two orders of magnitude ) longer than the vacuum rabi period of the coupled qubit - resonator system .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 27 ] , the authors proposed a theoretical scheme for creating noon states of two resonators , which was implemented in experiments for @xmath1 by h. wang et al . [ </S>",
    "<S> 28 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the method in [ 27,28 ] operates essentially by employing two three - level superconducting qutrits as couplers , preparing them in a bell state , and then performing @xmath2 steps of operation to swap the coherence of the bell state onto the two resonators through a sequence of classical pulses applied to the two coupler qutrits . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as discussed in [ 27,28 ] , a third resonator or cavity is needed in order to prepare the two coupler qutrits in the bell state .    </S>",
    "<S> ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 29 ] presented an approach to control the quantum state of two superconducting resonators using a complicated classical microwave pulse . for the generation of noon states , </S>",
    "<S> this scheme also requires two superconducting qubits which are initially prepared in a bell state . </S>",
    "<S> another problem is that the produced state is essentially an entangled state of two resonators and two qubits . to obtain the pure photonic noon state </S>",
    "<S> , one should use additional techniques to decouple the qubits from the resonators .    as reported in [ 28 ] , the fidelity of the obtained noon state decreases dramatically with the photon number @xmath2 due to decoherence , dropping to 0.33 for @xmath3 . in order to be useful in quantum technologies , </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity needs to be significantly improved . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is worthy of exploring more efficient schemes to generate the noon states with a higher fidelity .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an alternative scheme for generating the noon state of two resonators coupled to a superconducting transmon qutrit , via resonant interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this proposal has the following advantages : ( i ) because of using only one superconducting qutrit and two resonators , the experimental setup is greatly simplified when compared with that in [ 27 - 29 ] , which is important for decreasing decoherence effects ; ( ii ) in principle , there is no limitation on the intensity of the classical pulse for our scheme and thus the operation can be performed much faster when compared with the method in [ 26 ] . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the important features of our scheme are simplicity , rapidness , and robustness .    </S>",
    "<S> we will also give a detailed discussion of the experimental issues and then analyze the possible experimental implementation . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulation shows that a high - fidelity generation of the noon state with @xmath1 is feasible within the present circuit qed technique . </S>"
