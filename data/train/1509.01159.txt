    "the enhanced recombination probability leads then to a controlled photon emission .",
    "however , in order to stabilize the exciton against dissociation an additional electric field perpendicular to the plane of electrostatic confinement is usually adopted .",
    "the influence of this alignment of the exciton for the icir will be subject of a future study . in the case of more than one exciton ,",
    "the alignment leads to a dipole - dipole interaction between the excitons @xcite .",

    "arrays the icir may on the other hand be used as a possible switch that allows to turn - on or -off the tunnel current to a neighbor qd .",
