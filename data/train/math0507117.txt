    "given a  graph @xmath3 , one can try to color it with @xmath4 colors so that if two vertices are connected by an  edge , then they should get different colors .",
    "traditionally a  question of interest has been `` does such a  coloring exist ? ''",
    "if it does , then the possible colorings will form a  discrete set @xmath5 , with no a  priori given structure .",
    "it has recently been realized , that it is possible to add an  additional topological structure to this set .",
    "this is done by considering a  polyhedral complex @xmath6 , whose vertices are all legal colorings , as the choice of our notations indicate , and whose higher - dimensional cells encode `` commuting relations '' among the colorings .",
    "the complex @xmath6 is a  special case of the _ lovsz hom construction _ , which associates to any pair of graphs @xmath7 and @xmath3 ( no double edges , loops are allowed ) a  polyhedral , in fact prodsimplicial , see @xcite , complex @xmath8 , whose vertices are all graph homomorphisms from @xmath7 to @xmath3 and whose cells encode `` commuting relations '' among these homomorphisms .",
    "this paper is devoted to studying the cohomology groups of the coloring space of a  cycle : @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath9 is an odd number , the partial analysis of the topology of these spaces played a  central role in the resolution of the lovsz conjecture , see  @xcite . since then the study of @xmath10 complexes in general has become a  vibrant field ,",
    "see additionally @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 complexes even appeared in topological stochastics , see @xcite .",
    "the particular information about the cohomology groups of @xmath0 , which was needed for the proof of this conjecture consisted of computing the cohomology groups , with @xmath1 as well as with integer coefficients , up to dimension @xmath11 , analyzing the @xmath1-action on the cohomology groups ( in the case of @xmath12-coefficients ) , and computing the height of the stiefel - whitney characteristic classes ( for odd  @xmath4 ) .    here we present a  complete computation of the groups @xmath13 first with @xmath1 , and then with integer coefficients .",
    "the idea is to take the same spectral sequence as in @xcite , but this time to calculate the second tableau in its entirety .",
    "the main technical tool will be the detailed analysis of a  certain family of combinatorially defined cubical complexes @xmath14 , which is interesting in its own right .",
    "once these complexes are understood , we will almost have computed all the cohomology groups .",
    "the two additional ingredients are the computation of signs , to handle the case of the integer coefficients , as well as in - depth study of the top row entries in the second tableau .",
    "there are two byproducts of our investigation .",
    "first , several technical lemmas from @xcite are special cases of our statements here .",
    "thus , we find alternative simpler ways to confirm their correctness .",
    "second , the collapsing procedure for the complexes @xmath15 , which we call _ grinding _ for the graphic reasons which will become clear later , generalizes easily to yield a  collapsing procedure for the connected components of complexes @xmath2 , leading to symmetrical cores consisting of garlands of higher - dimensional cubes , linked in a  circle pattern by their opposite end vertices .",
    "thereby we obtain a  combinatorial strengthening of the earlier result that these connected components are either points or are homotopy equivalent to circles , see  @xcite .",

    "* section 4 .",
    "* we introduce the terminology of arc pictures and see how the generators of the entries in the first tableau of our spectral sequence can be indexed by them .",
    "this allows us to perform the first reduction in our computation of the second differential .",

    "the bulk of our calculation is concentrated in this section and in section  [ s : zsect ] .",
    "we rephrase the problem of computing the entries of the second tableau as a  question of computing the homology groups of a  certain family of cubical complexes , the so - called _ torus front complexes_.",
    "we find a  collapsing procedure on these complexes , which we call _ grinding _ , as a  result reducing them to the thin torus front complexes , which turn out to be garlands of cubes linked by the opposite end vertices .",
    "this allows almost a  complete computation of the second tableau of our spectral sequence with @xmath1-coefficients .",
    "* section 6 .",
    "* we use our filtration to prove a formula which expresses the euler characteristic of the @xmath10 complex in terms of euler characteristics of @xmath16 complexes .",
    "specifically , the euler characteristic of @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of euler characteristics of the independence complexes of induced subgraphs of  @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to an easy proof of an older formula .",
    "furthermore , we use the second tableau of our spectral sequence to derive a  formula for the euler characteristic of @xmath0 .    * section  [ s : zsect ] . * the complete calculation of the groups @xmath19 is finalized .",

    "it is obvious that this gives a  bijection between vertices of @xmath15 and @xmath222-grid paths satisfying the extra restriction that the horizontal legs are at least @xmath186-long .",

    "note that the complex @xmath227 is isomorphic to the complex @xmath228 , and so the complex @xmath229 is isomorphic to the complex @xmath230 .    to understand the complexes @xmath15 satisfying @xmath231 , we shall study the complexes @xmath214 with @xmath232 .      @xmath20    we shall now drastically simplify complexes @xmath214 be means of the collapsing procedure which we call _ grinding_. to illustrate the idea , let us consider the case @xmath233 , @xmath215 .",

    "this is the characteristic picture we shall now see in general .",
    "let @xmath7 be an @xmath201-torus front , which we represent as an @xmath201-grid path starting from @xmath210 .",

    "we call these two lines the _ millstones _ of  @xmath7 .    the _ width _ of the torus front @xmath7 , denoted @xmath243 , is the distance between the millstones measured along the line @xmath244",
    ". clearly , the width can not be less than @xmath245 , and the minimum is achieved only when @xmath246 by the torus front where northbound and eastbound edges alternate at every step .",
    "we let @xmath247 denote the set of the points in @xmath248 which we call _ northwestern extreme corners _ ; in the same way @xmath249 denotes the set of southeastern extreme corners .",
    "extreme corners are by construction always sharp corners .",
    "as mentioned above , each sharp corner defines an elementary flip of @xmath7 , during which it remains a  sharp corner , but changes orientation .",
    "if this sharp corner was extreme , then the new sharp corner would be extreme ( on the opposite side ) if and only if @xmath250 .",
    "clearly , for any torus front , the elementary flips of northwestern extreme corners are mutually non - interfering , and therefore form one flip ; the same is true for the southeastern extreme corners .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath251 , then these two sets of elementary flips do not interfere with each other either .",
    "indeed , if they did , it would mean that two neighboring vertices on the torus front are extreme corners of different orientations , which would imply @xmath252 .",
    "assume now that @xmath253 , and consider the total flip of all extreme corners .",
    "it is geometrically clear , that performing any combination of these elementary flips will not increase the width of the torus front , and that performing all of the northwestern flips , or all of the southeastern flips , simultaneously will for sure decrease it .",
    "another important observation is that if an extreme northwestern corner is flipped on a torus  front , where all horizontal legs have length at least  @xmath186 , then all horizontal legs have length at least  @xmath186 in the obtained torus front as well ; the same is true if we flip an extreme southeastern corner . to see this , note that the only time the horizontal leg could be decreased , is when one of its endpoints would be flipped .",
    "assume that the horizontal leg in question runs from vertex @xmath125 to vertex @xmath254 , that @xmath125 is flipped ( no loss of generality here ) , and denote by @xmath255 the vertex which we reach by the northbound edge from  @xmath254 .",
    "then , the slope of the line connecting @xmath125 with @xmath255 is @xmath256 , and , since we assumed @xmath257 , we have @xmath258 .",
    "the vertex @xmath125 is flipped , hence it is a  northwestern extreme corner , since @xmath255 must lie on @xmath240 or to the southeast of it , this implies that @xmath259 , yielding a  contradiction .",

    "it is easy to construct a  very thin torus front for fixed @xmath9 and @xmath4 : simply start from the point @xmath210 eastwards and then approximate the line connecting @xmath210 with @xmath201 as closely as possible , staying on one side of this line ( touching the line is permitted ) .",
    "it is clear that if the approximation is not the closest possible , then @xmath261 .",
    "it is also important to notice that , since we assumed @xmath262 , each horizontal leg in a  thin torus front has length at least @xmath186 , this can be proved with the same argument as the one we used to show that flipping all extreme corners preserves that property as well .",
    "let @xmath263 denote the line segment connecting @xmath210 with @xmath201 .",
    "counting from the origin in the northeastern direction , the first point on @xmath263 with integer coordinates , other than the origin itself , is @xmath264 , which can be achieved in @xmath265 steps , ( it is customary to denote the greatest common divisor with simple round brackets , but since @xmath201 is used to denote the point on the plane with these coordinates , we prefer here a  somewhat longer notation ) .",
    "the very thin torus front , which we just constructed , will have @xmath210 as a  northwestern extreme corner , and after that the northwestern extreme corners will repeat with the period of @xmath265 . from this",
    "we see that in general , to determine a  very thin torus front we just need to specify , where on the part of the torus front connecting two consequent northwestern extreme corners the origin will lie .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there are precisely @xmath265 very thin torus fronts , and that the width of any very thin @xmath201-torus front depends only on @xmath9  and  @xmath4 .",
    "we now extend the definition of width .",
    "for any flip @xmath213 , we define its width @xmath266 to be the maximum of widths of all the torus fronts which are members of  @xmath213 .",

    "note that it is possible that @xmath275 , or @xmath276 , but not both .    by our discussion above , if all horizontal legs have length at least @xmath186 in vertices of @xmath45 , then the same is true for all cells in the interval @xmath277 $ ] .",

    "the chain complex @xmath408 has only two non - zero entries , so let us write it as @xmath409 .",
    "if we worked over @xmath1 , this chain complex would be simply computing the homology of a  circle with coefficients in  @xmath1 . over integers we have signs and there are two possibilities : either @xmath410 , or @xmath411 , and @xmath412 . to distinguish between these two cases",
    "we shall now calculate the differential .    both groups @xmath413 and @xmath414 have @xmath9 generators .",

    "additionally , there are no non - zero elements northwest from @xmath459 .",
