    "accretion of gaseous material onto a central object is a process at the heart of many diverse astrophysical phenomena , from quasars to the formation of planetary systems @xcite . in many cases accretion",
    "is via a geometrically thin disc @xcite .",
    "the angular velocity of matter in the disc , @xmath0 , is keplerian ( @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the gravitational constant , @xmath3 is the mass of the accreting object and @xmath4 is the cylindrical radial distance from the center of the star ) throughout the disc except in the narrow boundary layer where it matches to the angular velocity of the central object @xmath5 at the inner radius of the disc , @xmath6 .",
    "accreting matter carries with it angular momentum which is acquired by the central object if it is rotating slower than the keplerian angular velocity at the inner radius of the disc @xcite .",
    "the rate of material angular momentum flux by accretion is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the accretion rate .",
    "viscous stresses also lead to a flux of angular momentum @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the kinematic turbulent viscosity and @xmath11 is the surface mass density . in the steady state",
    "the mass accretion rate , @xmath8 , and the total angular momentum flux , @xmath12 , in the disc are integration constants . for a keplerian disc the angular momentum balance leads to @xmath13",
    "usually one writes the total angular momentum flux in units of material stress for keplerian flow at the inner radius @xmath14 and the equation takes the more familiar form @xmath15    within the disc the viscous and the material torques can have different ratios though the total angular momentum flux is a constant determined by the fastness parameter @xmath16 . if the central object is rotating slowly , the angular velocity reaches a maximum value before matching the angular velocity of the star . at this point the viscous torque , as it depends on the radial angular velocity gradient , vanishes and the material torque is equal to the total angular momentum flux",
    ". if the boundary layer is narrow this allows one to estimate @xmath17 for slowly rotating objects .    if the disc is truncated beyond the stellar radius e.g.  by the strong magnetic dipole field of the star , it is possible without stellar break - up , that the angular velocity of the star is much greater than the keplerian angular velocity at the inner radius of the disc ( @xmath18 ) . in such cases",
    "the mass flux can diminish due to the centrifugal barrier @xcite and the viscous torque is negative i.e.  the angular momentum is transferred from the star to the disc ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "@xcite gave a steady state solution for such `` dead discs '' in which mass flux ( and so the material torque ) is zero .",
    "the steady state solutions of @xcite and @xcite have time - dependent counterparts as given by @xcite .",
    "these are self - similar solutions and extend to the origin , @xmath20 . in the first solution the mass accretion rate declines with a power - law in time while the angular momentum of the disc is constant ( @xmath21 ) @xcite . in the second solution",
    "the mass of the disc is constant ( @xmath22 ) but angular momentum of the disc increases with the viscous torque at the inner boundary @xcite .",
    "these extreme boundary conditions and the extension of the disc to @xmath20 in the solution manifest the necessity that no length scale should exist in order that a self - similar solution can be found .    in reality , as the disc is not infinitely thin , matter vertically away from the disc plane can accrete even when matter is propelled at the midplane .",
    "thus there should be a transition stage between these full accretion and full propeller stages during which the central object will accrete a fraction of the inflowing material @xcite depending on the fastness parameter .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that an episodic accretion stage @xcite will be realized near the transition stage separating the full accretion and full propeller stages .",
    "such a stage can not be described as a succession of steady states as @xmath8 is an integration constant and hence whatever the accretion rate in the disc should be the rate of accretion onto the star . the self - similar solutions because they correspond to extreme boundary conditions , either @xmath21 or @xmath22 , also can not accommodate the continuum of angular momentum flux per mass accretion rate , @xmath23 , to be realized in the continuous transition between the full propeller and full accretor stages .",
    "in this work we construct an approximate self - similar time dependent solution via a prescription recently used by @xcite for self - similar evolution of temperature distribution in a semi - infinite rod with partial heat insulation at one boundary . in the next section disc structure equations and the self - similar solutions of @xcite",
    "is reviewed . in ",
    "3 the `` nonlinear superposition '' method of @xcite is applied to these solutions to construct a self - similar approximate solution with arbitrary values of @xmath24 . in ",
    "4 we demonstrate the accuracy of the approximate analytical solution by comparing it with numerical results . in the final section we discuss some implications for neutron star soft x - ray transients .",
    "we consider the evolution of a non - self - gravitating viscous thin disc in the gravitational field of a central mass @xmath3 .",
    "the conservation of mass in cylindrical coordinates reads@xmath25where @xmath26 is the surface mass density and@xmath27is the mass flow rate , @xmath28 being the radial velocity .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum reads@xmath29where @xmath30 is the angular velocity of the fluid and @xmath31is the angular momentum flux ( torque ) .",
    "the first term is the material torque and the second term is the viscous torque where @xmath32 is the turbulent kinematic viscosity .",
    "the form of the conservation equations ( [ cont1 ] ) and ( [ ang1 ] ) make it clear that in the steady state the accretion rate @xmath8 and angular momentum flux @xmath33 are two integrals of motion . assuming the matter in the disc is in keplerian orbits , @xmath34 where @xmath35 , equation ( [ ang1 ] ) with the help of equation  ( [ cont1 ] ) reduces to @xmath36 this then can be plugged into equation  ( [ cont1 ] ) to give the diffusion equation @xmath37   \\label{diff1}\\ ] ] for the evolution of the surface mass density .",
    "the equation is linear if @xmath10 does not depend on @xmath11 . in general the viscosity",
    "depends on @xmath11 and the equation is nonlinear .",
    "the rest of the disc structure equations are as follows @xcite : we employ @xcite turbulent viscosity prescription @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter , @xmath40 is the sound speed , @xmath41 is the disc scale height and @xmath42 is the pressure . the density is then given by @xmath43 . assuming the heat produced by viscous processes",
    "are radiated locally , the energy balance can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the temperature at the disc mid plane and @xmath46 is the rosseland mean opacity .",
    "these equations are then supported by the equation of state @xmath47 and a prescription for the opacity @xmath48 .",
    "the pressure has contributions from both the gas pressure , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mean molecular weight , and radiation pressure @xmath51 .",
    "we assume the gas pressure dominates the radiation pressure throughout the disc .",
    "opacity is in general of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constants depending on the dominating opacity regime ( e.g.  @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath58 g@xmath59 for electron scattering ) .",
    "these algebraic disc structure equations can be solved among themselves first to obtain viscosity ( and other variables ) in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath11 in the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are constants determined by the dominant opacity regime and pressure ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this then can be plugged in the diffusion equation ( [ diff1 ] ) to obtain an equation containing @xmath11 only . for discs in which gas pressure and electron scattering opacity dominates @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite . in comparing the analytical solutions with the numerical solutions we assume this regime to prevail throughout the disc though it is well known that different opacity and pressure regimes prevail at different locations of the disc depending on temperature @xmath66 .      in order to apply self - similarity methods we render the equation dimensionless via @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and",

    "note also that the solutions for the linear cases ( @xmath77 ) can be found from the nonlinear cases by referring @xmath78 . in the linear solutions the @xmath79 case should be handled separately as is done by @xcite .",
    "we do not write the solution for this case as it would not contribute to the main motivation of the paper .    in the non - dimensionalization process",
    "we have employed four quantities , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , related by two equations @xmath84 and @xmath71 .",
    "this means we are free to attribute any value for two of the variables e.g.  @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we fix these two quantities in terms of the initial mass and angular momentum of the disc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the pringle solutions given in equations ( [ sol1 ] ) and ( [ sol2 ] ) describe the evolution of thin discs with free outer boundaries and thus are more appropriate for discs that are not truncated e.g.  by tidal torques .",
    "the physical meaning of the first solution ( full accretor ) was clarified by @xcite who modeled the evolution of a disc formed by tidally disrupted star around a supermassive black hole .",

    "a real disc will have a finite inner radius and so the integrals then can provide the correct parameters as long as this inner radius is much smaller than the outer radius .          according to the first solution given in equation  ( [ sol1 ] )",

    "we have seen that the self - similar evolution of the disc is well described by the approximate solution given in equation  ( [ approximate ] ) , for a certain value of @xmath24 found by solving @xmath24 from equation  ( [ width ] ) : @xmath183 the left panel of figure  [ fig_sig ] shows the surface density profile in the inner region of the disc at @xmath184 years for @xmath185 , 0.10 , 0.50 and 1.00 .",

    "is determined by the number of grids we have chosen .",
    "it thus appears as a numerical quantity that would vanish if we could do numerical computing with infinite number of grids . at the inner boundary of the disc",
    "the matter rotating with keplerian angular velocity has to come to corotation with the star over some region of narrow width , the boundary layer . in our numerical solution of the diffusion equation ( [ diff1 ] ) in which the keplerian rotation is built in , non - keplerian rotation in the boundary layer",
    "can not be modeled and it is implicitly assumed that this transition takes place at the innermost grid and is unresolved . for real discs which do not have grids , @xmath186 has the physical meaning as the relative width of the region over which matter in the disc is brought into corotation with the star .",
    "equation ( [ width ] ) then tells that the relative width of this transition region is determined by the fraction of matter that could traverse it and the dimensionless torque . the relative width is determined by the stresses that bring the matter in the disc to co - rotation with the star .",
    "it is not necessarily the viscous torques . in the case of magnetized stars truncating the disc beyond the stellar surface",
    "this could be the magnetic stress applied by the rotating magnetosphere of the star .      in the previous subsection",
    "the value of @xmath168 was kept constant throughout the simulation .",
    "it was found that the accretion rate leaving the disc @xmath187 follows precisely the value given in equation  ( [ mdot_d ] ) calculated from the full accretor solution and not less of it .",
    "this is because when a fraction @xmath168 of the inflowing mass accretes and the rest @xmath172 remains in the disc the surface density @xmath11 and subsequently the accretion rate increases . within a viscous time - scale in the disc @xmath169",
    "increases so that @xmath188 and not something less .",
    "self - similar approximate solution given in equation  ( [ approximate ] ) describes this asymptotic stage .    in order to see the behavior of the system when the boundary condition changes we should change the boundary condition more rapidly than the viscous time - scale in the disc . with this motivation we have changed @xmath168 from 1 to 0.01 abruptly at a critical mass flow rate @xmath189 at which centrifugal barrier sets in . in real systems , of course",
    ", we expect that @xmath168 will change more smoothly with the fastness parameter ( see e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "the result of this simulation is shown in figure  [ fig_mdot_in ] .",
    "we observe that with the start of the partial accretion regime the accretion rate onto the star deviates from its trend given by equation  ( [ mdot_d ] ) .",
    "this is only for a brief epoch because the rest of the matter retained in the disc increases @xmath169 to @xmath190 so that @xmath191 asymptotes to the value given by equation  ( [ mdot_d ] ) .",
    "the transient stage following the immediate aftermath of the transition to partial accretion is not modeled by the approximate self - similar solution given in equation ( [ approximate ] ) as self - similar solutions describe the asymptotic stage when the system reaches quasi - equilibrium .",
    "at which partial accretion starts .",
    "the solid line shows the analytical expression of mass accretion rate given in equation  ( [ mdot_d ] ) .",
    "initially @xmath192 and so all mass accretes ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "the dashed lines showing @xmath169 ( see eqn.([mdot_max ] ) ) and dotted lines showing @xmath187 in units of @xmath189 coincide at this stage and they both catch up with the analytical expression soon after the initial conditions are forgotten . when the mass inflow rate drops below @xmath189 only a fraction @xmath185 is allowed to accrete onto the central object using the boundary condition given in equation  ( [ partial_bc ] ) .",
    "although @xmath187 initially drops abruptly as a result of this boundary condition , it catches up with the analytical value given in equation  ( [ mdot_d ] ) in a viscous time - scale .",
    "this is because the density at the inner disc increases in response as 99% of the inflowing mass is retained in the disk i.e.  @xmath169 tends to increase to @xmath190 so that its multiplication with @xmath168 still gives @xmath193 . , scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "by using a recently suggested prescription we have constructed an approximate self - similar solution , given in equation ( [ unified ] ) , describing the evolution of a partially accreting disc .",
    "this motivated another approximate solution given in equation ( [ approximate ] ) which has a constant finite inner radius .",
    "we have numerically shown that this solution describes the asymptotic stage achieved after a few viscous time - scales just like the exact solutions but describes the continuous range of inner boundary conditions between full accretion and full propeller .",
    "the approximate solution describes the inner region of the disk even better than the exact solution in the full accretion stage ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "the partial accretion might lead to a rapid decline stage @xcite during an outburst of a neutron star soft x - ray transient when the accretion rate drops below a critical value at which the inner radius moves beyond the corotation radius and the centrifugal barrier allows only a fraction of the inflowing matter from the off midplane of the disc @xcite .",
    "our results imply that partial accretion stage can change the accretion luminosity only if the decay timescale is short so that the inner boundary condition changes abruptly .",
    "otherwise the mass accumulation at the inner boundary increases the accretion rate onto the central object to the same value it would have if there was no partial accretion within the viscous time - scale . as the viscous time scale in the disc increases with the size of the disc it leads to the expectation that partial accretion can lead to a rapid decline stage in systems allowing small size discs i.e.  transient systems with short orbital periods like accreting millisecond pulsars .",
    "the self - similar solutions considered here are more appropriate for free discs e.g.  supernova debris discs around young neutron stars @xcite rather than the tidally truncated discs in binary systems .",
    "a debris disc was discovered by @xcite around an anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ; see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "central compact objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) like cas a might also harbor fallback discs @xcite .",
    "@xcite mentioned that fallback disc models of axps should incorporate accretion and propeller mechanisms working simultaneously .",
    "partial accretion was proposed by @xcite to explain the present day luminosities of axps if they have descended from 10 ms spin periods by interacting with fallback discs .",
    "our results imply for these systems that even if some of these systems are in a partial accretion regime , their long term luminosity trend is determined by the mass flow rate derived from the full accretion solution of @xcite .",
    "mass flow rate variations due to disc instabilities would result in modifications of this accretion rate if these changes occur sufficiently rapid .",
