    "there exists evidence from lattice simulations that qcd vacuum is a dual superconductor in the confining phase , and undergoes a transition to normal state at deconfinement temperature@xcite .",
    "this support the idea that confinement is produced by dual meissner effect@xcite .",
    "however there are aspects of confinement which are not understood in this scenario .",
    "the evidence for dual superconductivity from lattice simulations can be put into two categories : phenomenological and direct .",
    "phenomenological evidence is the observation of basic features which are consistent with the picture : + 1 ) existence of string tension , as detected by the area law behaviour of wilson loops@xcite , indicating that confinement really takes place in qcd .",
    "+ 2 ) existence of flux tube configurations between static @xmath0 pairs@xcite .",
    "+ 3 ) string like behaviour of flux tubes@xcite .",
    "direct evidence is instead produced by detection of monopole condensation . a non zero vacuum expectation value for any operator carrying non zero magnetic charge signals spontaneous breaking of magnetic @xmath1 and hence dual superconductivity@xcite . an alternative way of investigation consists in detecting persistent ( london ) electric currents in the vacuum , which are a direct consequence of dual superconductivity@xcite .",
    "monopoles which are expected to condense in the ground state to produce dual superconductivity are @xmath1 monopoles defined by a procedure known as `` abelian projection '' , in terms of any local operator @xmath2 belonging to the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "these dirac monopoles are located in the field configurations at the sites where @xmath2 has zeros .",
    "the equation @xmath3 identifies the world line of a monopole , we are referring to @xmath4 gauge group for simplicity of notation .    thus there",
    "exist a functional infinity of abelian projections , and each of them defines monopoles .",
    "the question is then : + is any of these abelian projection better than the others ? or +",
    "can we identify `` the abelian projection '' , which describes confinement ?",
    "an argument of continuity suggests that this is not the case : infinitesimal changes of @xmath5 can not produce dramatic effects as going from condensation to absence of it .",
    "moreover if one single abelian projection is at work , the string tension in the adjoint representation is zero : one gluon in @xmath4 ( two of them in @xmath6 ) have zero @xmath1 charge and there is no flux tube between them .",
    "the colour content of flux tubes should be in the direction of abelian projected @xmath1 , since it is the abelian projected chromoelectric field which is channeled into abrikosov flux tubes . a test on lattice shows that it is isotropically oriented in colour space@xcite .",
    "our strategy to this problem is the following : we have a reliable disorder parameter which can detect dual superconductivity@xcite . by use of it",
    "we investigate in different abelian projections 1 ) the existence of dual superconductivity in conjunction with confinement .",
    "2 ) the type of supeconductivity .",
    "this systematic investigation is on the way .",
    "our preliminary results are that different abelian projection ( polyakov line , field strength , max abelian ) identify monopoles which condense in the confined phase , and do not in the deconfined one .",
    "this agrees with the idea of thooft that all abelian projections are physically equivalent@xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "all this indicates that qcd vacuum is more than a @xmath1 dual superconductor : some different , non abelian yet unknown mechanism is at work , which shows up as @xmath1 dual superconductivity in different abelian projections .",
    "we define an operator @xmath7 which has magnetic charge @xmath8 .",
    "we then measure its correlation function with the charge conjugate operator @xmath9 ; e.g. @xmath10 @xmath11 is the lowest mass in the sector with magnetic charge @xmath12 : @xmath13 signals spontaneous breaking of magnetic @xmath1 and hence dual superconductivity .",
    "we also measure the penetration depth of the electric field in the vacuum @xmath14 . if @xmath15 the superconductor is type ii@xcite .",
    "@xmath16 is the ratio of two partition functions@xcite @xmath17}{\\displaystyle z[s ] } \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] @xmath18 is the modification of the plaquettes @xmath19 in the action at time 0 , when the monopole is created and at time @xmath20 , when it is destroyed . for @xmath1",
    "the modification consists in the substitution @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 being the vector potential produced by a dirac monopole sitting at the origin @xmath24 in computing @xmath25 $ ] the shift ( [ eq:3 ] ) can be reabsorbed in a shift of the angle @xmath26 , at @xmath27 , which leaves the measure of the integral invariant .",
    "this produces at time 1 the following change @xmath28 meaning that a monopole has been created . at the same time @xmath29 and again a change of variables @xmath30 exposes a monopole at @xmath31 , and a shift in @xmath32 and so on , till @xmath33 is reached and @xmath34 cancels with @xmath35 in eq.([eq:4 ] ) .",
    "in fact a more convenient quantity than @xmath36 is @xmath37 : for @xmath38 , as @xmath39 , @xmath40 tends to a finite value , so that @xmath41 for @xmath38 tends to a positive function@xcite . for @xmath42 @xmath43 so that @xmath44 in the infinite volume limit . around @xmath45 a finite size scaling analysis allows a precise determination of @xmath45 , of the critical index by which @xmath44 at @xmath45 , and of the critical index of the correlation length .",
    "more generally the construction works for phase transitions produced by condensation of topological solitons in the vacuum : vortices in 3d @xmath48 model@xcite , fig.4 , @xmath49 solitons in 3d heisenberg model@xcite .",
    "in conclusion we have a reliable tool to investigate @xmath1 dual superconductivity .",
    "we are using it to explore abelian projected @xmath1 in non abelian gauge theories , in different abelian projections .",
