    "the recent discovery at the lhc @xcite of a new particle having mass about 125gev and other properties compatible with those of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson undoubtedly has far - reaching implications for efforts to search for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "particularly , all new - physics models would have to include such a particle , hereafter denoted by @xmath0 , as one of their ingredients .",
    "in general , different models would have different production rates and decay patterns for @xmath0 because of contributions from and/or mixing with other new particles .",
    "it is therefore important to have a  detailed study of the characteristic quantum numbers of @xmath0 and its interactions with sm particles .",
    "it is hoped that through such an analysis , the newly discovered particle will provide us with hints of new physics .",
    "one of the possible scenarios for new physics is the existence of an extra u(1 ) gauge group involving a massive gauge particle , the @xmath1 boson .",
    "such a gauge symmetry may have its origin from various grand unified theories , string - inspired models , dynamical symmetry breaking models , and little higgs models  @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "the @xmath1 boson in different representative models has been directly searched for at colliders as well as indirectly probed via a variety of precision data  @xcite , putting limits on its gauge coupling and/or mass .",
    "generally speaking , the @xmath1 couplings to sm fermions can be family universal or nonuniversal .",
    "the latter case has especially attracted a lot of interest in recent years due to its many interesting phenomenological implications  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we focus on family - nonuniversal interactions of the @xmath1 with the neutrinos and charged leptons and explore constraints on its relevant couplings from a number of experiments on transitions involving leptons in the initial and final states , plus possibly a photon .",
    "these processes suffer less from qcd corrections and hadronic uncertainties than processes involving hadrons .",
    "moreover , many of such experiments have been performed at a high precision , imposing relatively stringent constraints on any possible new interactions .",
    "more specifically , we assume that the @xmath1 boson arises from a new u(1 ) gauge symmetry , interacts with leptons in a family - nonuniversal way , and has negligible mixing with the @xmath2 boson for simplicity , but otherwise adopt a model - independent approach to make the analysis as general as possible . due to the family nonuniversality , such a @xmath1 boson would feature flavor - changing leptonic couplings at tree level , leading to the distinctive signature of lepton - flavor violation .",
    "however , lepton - flavor violating processes have been searched for at colliders with null results .",
    "we therefore examine a  number of flavor - conserving and flavor - changing processes to evaluate constraints on the leptonic @xmath1 couplings .",
    "the results are then used to estimate @xmath1 contributions to both flavor - conserving and flavor - changing decays of the higgs boson into a pair of leptons , @xmath4 , at the one - loop level .",
    "as @xmath0 will be probed with increasing precision at the lhc in coming years , and even more so if a  higgs factory is built in the future , the acquired data could reveal the signals of the @xmath1 boson which we consider , assuming that @xmath0 is a sm - like higgs boson .",
    "last but not least , we will compute the @xmath1 effects on several four - lepton decays of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 bosons and make comparison with the data if available . the lhc may also be sensitive to such indirect indications of the @xmath1 presence . the information on the @xmath1 gained from the @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 measurements would be complementary to that from the @xmath1 direct searches .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the interactions of the @xmath1 boson with the leptons in section  [ sec : interactions ] , allowing for in particular flavor - nonuniversal couplings . in section  [ sec : constraints ] , we study constraints on the couplings of the  @xmath1 from @xmath2-pole data , cross sections of @xmath5 scattering into lepton - antilepton pairs measured at lep  ii , various experimental limits on low - energy flavor - changing processes involving charged leptons , and measurements of their anomalous magnetic moments . in section  [ sec : predictions ] , we proceed to make predictions on both flavor - conserving and flavor - changing decays of @xmath0 into a pair of charged leptons .",
    "we also explore the @xmath1 contributions to @xmath3 and @xmath2 decays into four leptons .",
    "we summarize our findings in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the lagrangian describing the interactions of the @xmath1 boson with neutrinos @xmath6 and charged leptons @xmath7 can be expressed as @xmath8 where summation over @xmath9 is implied , the primes of the lepton fields refer to their interaction eigenstates , @xmath10 , and the parameters @xmath11 are generally different from one another , reflecting the family nonuniversality . to denote the triplet of charged leptons , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 to refer to an individual charged lepton in general . ]",
    "the hermiticity of @xmath14 requires these coupling constants to be real . since each of the left - handed neutrinos and its charged counterpart form a sm weak doublet , they share the same  @xmath15",
    ". since we are concerned with processes below the electroweak scale , we do not consider right - handed neutrinos in the low - energy spectrum .",
    "the @xmath1 may also have couplings to quarks and other nonstandard fermions , but we do not address them in this analysis .",
    "the interaction states are related to the mass eigenstates @xmath16 and @xmath17 by @xmath18 where @xmath19 for fermion @xmath20 and the 3@xmath213 matrices @xmath22 are unitary . in terms of the mass eigenstates , one can then write @xmath23 where summation over @xmath24 is implied and @xmath25 it follows that @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "hence family nonuniversality implies that the @xmath1 interactions with the leptons can be flavor violating at tree level .",
    "furthermore , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are generally unequal .",
    "we begin with the determination of constraints from the existing data on the @xmath2-boson decays @xmath30 and  @xmath31 . for the former , the amplitude takes the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 contain both sm and @xmath1 contributions and are given by @xmath35 with as usual the weak coupling constant @xmath36 and @xmath37 involving the weinberg angle .    in the absence of @xmath2-@xmath1 mixing , the @xmath1 effects modify the @xmath38 vertex and leptonic self - energy diagrams at the one - loop level .",
    "we obtain @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{7ex } -\\ ; i\\pi\\ , \\biggl [ 3 + 2\\delta+ 2(1+\\delta)^2\\,\\ln\\frac{\\delta}{1+\\delta } \\biggr ] \\biggr\\ } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where li@xmath40 is the dilogarithm .",
    "the expression for the real part of @xmath41 has been derived previously  @xcite .",
    "the relevant observables here are the forward - backward asymmetry at the @xmath2 pole and decay rate @xmath42 where @xmath43 in @xmath31 , the @xmath1-loop contributions are analogous to those in the charged - lepton case , but without the right - handed couplings .",
    "since the unobserved neutrinos in the final state may belong to different mass eigenstates , we can express the amplitude as @xmath44 since @xmath28 and @xmath29 are related according to eq.([bb * ] ) , summing over the final neutrinos then results in the decay rate @xmath45 accordingly , this channel may offer a complementary probe for  @xmath29 . from the formula for @xmath46 in  eq.([epsilonllz ] ) , we can then see that these @xmath2 decay modes are potentially sensitive to not only the flavor - conserving @xmath1 couplings , but also the flavor - changing ones .",
    "these @xmath2-pole observables have been measured with good precision .",
    "the experimental and sm values of @xmath47 are  @xcite , in mev , @xmath48 while those of @xmath49 are  @xcite @xmath50 for @xmath31 , we have  @xcite , also in mev , @xmath51    numerically , for the sm contributions we employ the tree - level formulas in eqs .",

    "since @xmath1-mediated diagrams can contribute to @xmath85 scattering , its data can provide additional restrictions on the @xmath1 couplings . here",

    "we find that the magnitudes of @xmath212 and @xmath212 are smaller than @xmath213 because of the constraints on @xmath214 and @xmath215 in fig.[beebll - limits ] , while the magnitude of @xmath216 can be comparatively greater , @xmath217 the positive ( negative ) sign of @xmath218 corresponding to the negative ( positive ) sign of @xmath219 .",
    "one can see that the upper bound of @xmath220 is roughly similar in order of magnitude to the lower bounds of @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "we also consider the flavor - violating 4-lepton decays of the @xmath2 , concentrating on the modes @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225 , as their amplitudes are determined by @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 , respectively .",
    "the constraints on the first two products of couplings are given in table@xmath76[le - limits ] , and the upper limits on @xmath229 come from fig.[bll - limits ] . applying the biggest values from eq.([biggest ] ) and the upper limit on @xmath230 in fig.[bll - limits ] , we find that the branching ratios are of @xmath231 for the first two modes and @xmath232 for the third one , which will be unobservable in the near future .",
    "the 4-lepton decays of the @xmath3 are treated similarly . in the flavor - conserving case , the fractional change @xmath233 for @xmath75 depend on @xmath234 , in light of the relation between @xmath235 and @xmath236 in eq .",
    "( [ bb * ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath237 where the lowest value corresponds to @xmath238gev and we have employed the @xmath201gev cut as before in estimating the rates .",
    "the @xmath239 numbers are almost the same because the upper limits of @xmath240 are the same . since the sm prediction is @xmath241 , again a large luminosity is required to measure the changes , as in the @xmath2-decay case . for the flavor - violating 4-lepton decays of the @xmath3",
    ", we consider the @xmath242 and @xmath243 channels .",
    "we obtain the biggest branching ratios of these modes from the upper limits of @xmath244 and @xmath230 , respectively .",
    "using  eq.([biggest ] ) and fig.[bll - limits ] , we find that the branching ratio of the first mode is at most of @xmath245 and that of the second mode @xmath232",
    ". hence they will likely be undetectable for a long time , as the flavor - violating 4-lepton @xmath2 decays .",
    "we have explored a @xmath1 boson originating from a new u(1 ) gauge symmetry and interacting with leptons in a family - nonuniversal way . the @xmath1 is assumed to have no mixing with the @xmath2 boson .",
    "we have studied the effects of the @xmath1 as a virtual particle in various processes with leptons in the initial and/or final states , especially the leptonic decays of the newly discovered @xmath0 , putatively a standard model - like higgs boson .",
    "we first study bounds on the leptonic couplings of the @xmath1 from available experimental data .",
    "we employ the @xmath2-pole observables , including the @xmath246 rates , the associated forward - backward asymmetries , and the invisible @xmath2 decay rate , to put constraints on @xmath247 .",
    "the cross sections of @xmath248 for @xmath249 from lep - ii experiments are used to place bounds on the products of chiral couplings @xmath250 for @xmath251 .",
    "further restrictions are found from various low - energy processes , including the muonium - antimuonium conversion for @xmath252 in particular , several flavor - changing leptonic 3-body and radiative 2-body decays of the muon and tauon , and the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and muon .",
    "we then apply the constraints on the @xmath1 couplings and mass to make predictions for the flavor - conserving and -violating 2-body leptonic decays of @xmath0 as well as 4-body decays of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 . for the flavor - violating @xmath253 decays ,",
    "the most important contribution comes from the case with one @xmath125 in the final state and an internal @xmath125 running in the loop due to mass enhancement .",
    "unfortunately , such @xmath1-mediated flavor - violating higgs decays are too small to be observable in the near future . on the other hand",
    ", the flavor - conserving @xmath254 decay can be significantly affected by the contribution of an internal @xmath125 . with flavor - changing couplings alone ,",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath255 decay may be enhanced by a mere few percent .",
    "in contrast , with only flavor - conserving couplings , both the @xmath255 and @xmath256 channels can be considerably modified by a few tens to a few hundreds percent .",
    "consequently , upcoming measurements of the latter mode with better precision than its current data will either uncover or constrain the @xmath1 boson .",
    "we have found that the flavor - violating @xmath257 decays , mediated by the @xmath1 at the loop level , are consistent with current experimental upper bounds at 95% cl .",
    "the 4-body leptonic decays of the @xmath2 have started to be measured by the lhc .",
    "our calculations show that a larger luminosity is required to observe modifications in flavor - conserving @xmath258 decays due to the @xmath1 , the maximal changes being of  @xmath259 .",
    "a similar situation holds for flavor - conserving @xmath260 decays .",
    "we have also found that the changes in the flavor - violating @xmath258 and @xmath260 decays are unlikely to be observable soon .",
