    "so far all of the large - scale gravitational wave detectors ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , tama300 @xcite and geo600 @xcite have been operated at the dark fringe using a heterodyne readout technique . however , the operation of the currently running interferometers revealed several problems being connected with heterodyne readout . changing the readout system to _ dc - readout _ , which is a special case of homodyne detection , can be beneficial for future gravitational wave detectors . therefore it is planned to implement dc - readout in enhanced ligo @xcite and virgo+ @xcite as well as in advanced ligo @xcite and advanced virgo @xcite .",
    "in this article we give an overview of work related to dc - readout carried out at the geo600 gravitational wave detector .",
    "we begin , in section  [ sec : principle ] , with a brief description of the principles of heterodyne , homodyne and dc - readout applied to a simple michelson interferometer as an illustrative example . in section",
    "[ sec : advantages ] we give a brief summary of the expected advantages and disadvantages of dc - readout over heterodyne detection .",
    "we compare the simulated shot - noise limited sensitivity of geo600 with heterodyne and homodyne readout in section  [ sec : shotnoise ] .",
    "it is found that in the case of detuned signal recycling not only is the overall level of the shot noise different for homodyne and heterodyne readout , but also the shape of the optical response .",
    "the actual experimental scheme for realisation of dc - readout in the geo600 interferometer is described in detail in section  [ sec : realisation ] . as we show in section  [ sec : rotation ] the simulated shape change of the optical response is accurately confirmed by experimental observations .",
    "a comparison of the actual sensitivity of the geo600 detector for homodyne and the nominal heterodyne detection scheme is given in section  [ sec : sensitivity ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : summary ] provides a summary of this article and an outlook .",
    "figure  [ fig : principle ] shows simplified schematics of three different readout methods applied to a basic michelson interferometer .",
    "usually michelson interferometers used for gravitational wave detection are operated at a dark fringe : the differential arm - length is controlled to give destructive interference at the output port , i.e.  ideally no carrier light ( @xmath0 , red solid line ) reaches the photo detector .",
    "the interaction of a gravitational wave with the michelson interferometer can be considered as shorting of one interferometer arm , whilst the perpendicular one is elongated .",
    "this change of the differential arm length causes phase modulation sidebands , i.e. gravitational wave signal sidebands ( blue dashed line ) .",
    "in contrast to the carrier light the gravitational wave signal sidebands interfere constructively at the beam splitter , exit the interferometer at its output port and finally reach the photo detector .",
    "the absolute frequency of the gravitational signal sidebands given is by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the frequency of the gravitational wave ( usually in the audio - band ) and @xmath0 the frequency of the main laser light ( carrier ) .",
    "since @xmath3 is a few hundred terahertz , the photo diode can not directly detect the gravitational wave signal , unless the presence of an optical local oscillator is provided .",
    "heterodyne , homodyne and dc - readout use different concepts to ensure the presence of a low - noise optical local oscillator at the output port photo diode .    in the heterodyne schemes ,",
    "commonly used by the first generation gravitational wave detectors , radio frequency ( rf ) sidebands ( @xmath4 , green dotted lines ) are modulated onto the light at the input of the michelson interferometer ( schnupp modulation @xcite ) . introducing a macroscopic arm length difference of several centimeter ( so - called schnupp asymmetry ) allows the modulation sidebands to be transferred through the interferometer to the output port , where they serve as optical local oscillator for the gravitational wave signal .",
    "the photo - current produced by the beat between the different optical field components ( optical demodulation ) contains a radio frequency component at @xmath5 . in a second demodulation process",
    "the photo - current is then electronically demodulated at @xmath4 ( using a mixer ) in order to finally derive a signal stream at @xmath2 .    in the homodyne readout scheme ( center plot of figure  [ fig : principle ] ) a small fraction of the carrier light is split off in front of the interferometer and guided directly to the output photo detector without passing through the interferometer .",
    "the big advantage of this form of homodyne readout is that a phase shifter , placed in the local oscillator path , allows an easy change of the optical demodulation phase , i.e.  the readout quadrature , without any hardware changes . on the other hand homodyne readout has the disadvantage that the length and the alignment of the local - oscillator path needs to be highly stable . in practice",
    "this usually implies that the local - oscillator path length as well as its alignment need to be actively stabilized by a low - noise control system , and all components of the local - oscillator path must be seismically isolated inside a vacuum system . due to these demanding noise and hardware requirements ,",
    "so far there have been no serious plans to change the readout scheme of the currently operating gravitational wave detectors from heterodyne to homodyne readout .",
    "dc - readout is a special case of homodyne readout which is much easier to combine with the existing elements of currently used gravitational wave detectors . in a dc - readout scheme",
    "the operating point of the michelson interferometer is slightly shifted off the dark fringe , by introducing a so - called _ dark - fringe offset _",
    ", thus a certain amount of carrier light leaves the interferometer at the output port and can serve as local oscillator .",
    "compared with the previously described homodyne readout , dc - readout has the advantage that no additional local oscillator path outside the main interferometer is required .",
    "on the other hand , dc - readout offers no easy way to vary the phase of the optical demodulation .",
    "dc - readout was already used in the first ` michelson ' interferometer ever by michelson and morley in 1887 @xcite .",
    "it is probably the simplest way to read out a michelson interferometer , but was considered to be unsuitable for the first generation of gravitational wave detectors due to the strong coupling of laser power noise .",
    "however , increased stability of the laser power inside future instruments gives hope for a renaissance of dc - readout for gravitational wave detectors , which was first proposed by fritschel 2000 @xcite .",
    "a demonstration of a dc - readout in a suspended prototype interferometer ( without signal recycling ) has recently been performed @xcite .",
    "the next section briefly summarises the general advantages and disadvantages of dc - readout compared with heterodyne readout , especially taking into account the implications for an interferometer with tuned or detuned signal recycling @xcite .",
    "dc - readout has many advantages over the commonly used heterodyne readout which are summarized in the following list :    1 .",
    "first of all , when going from the currently - used heterodyne readout scheme to a dc - readout  scheme the ratio of signal to shot noise will increase @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the homodyne detection the shot noise contribution from frequencies twice the heterodyne frequency does not exist ( please see section  [ sec : shotnoise ] for more details ) .",
    "a reduced number of beating light fields at the detection port potentially reduces and simplifies the couplings of technical noise @xcite .",
    "especially the coupling of amplitude and phase noise of the heterodyne modulation is strongly reduced in a dc - readout scheme .",
    "in addition the frequency noise coupling to the gravitational wave channel is also expected to be reduced in dc - readout .",
    "3 .   a simpler calibration procedure can be applied , because the gw - signal is present in a single data - stream even for detuned signal - recycling ( and not spread over the two heterodyne quadratures as described in @xcite ) .",
    "4 .   as the main photo diode(s ) and electronics for",
    "the detection do not need to be capable of handling rf signals , they can be simplified .",
    "5 .   large - area photo diodes may be used .",
    "these should offer reduced coupling of beam - pointing noise , due to decreased beam clipping and decreased influence of photo diode inhomogeneity ( by averaging over a larger area ) .",
    "6 .   as in the homodyne readout the local oscillator and the gw - signal",
    "pass the same optical system an optimal spatial overlap is guaranteed .",
    "( due to thermal distortion current gw detectors employing arm cavities encountered the problem of imperfect spatial overlap of the carrier light ( gw signal ) and the heterodyne sidebands ( local oscillator ) @xcite ) 7 .   finally , the realization of a squeezed light enhanced interferometer is simpler using dc - readout rather than heterodyne readout .",
    "dc - readout requires squeezed light to be present only at frequencies in the gw signal bandwidth compared to heterodyne readout which requires squeezed light around twice the heterodyne frequency as well @xcite .",
    "this long list of advantages has to be compared with the drawbacks of dc - readout .",
    "even though power fluctuations of the carrier light ( i.e.  the local oscillator ) are strongly filtered by the cavity poles of the power recycling cavity and the high - finesse arm cavities , the major disadvantage of dc - readout is ( at least for geo600 ) an increased coupling of laser power noise ( see section  [ sec : sensitivity ] ) .",
    "in addition there is the potential problem that the response from dc - readout is not completely linear , due to the operating point sitting on the near - quadratic slope close to the dark fringe .",
    "however , this should not be a significant problem as long as the mean deviation from the differential arm length operation point is not too large .",
    "figure [ fig : shotnoise ] displays the shot noise limited sensitivity of the geo600 interferometer for heterodyne readout ( dashed lines ) and dc - readout ( solid lines ) , in both cases for each 3 different signal - recycling tunings .",
    "these simulations , carried out with the interferometer simulation software finesse @xcite show two major differences of two different readout methods :    1 .   for each signal - recycling tuning the peak sensitivity achieved with dc - readout is better than the one from heterodyne readout .",
    "2 .   for detuned",
    "signal - recycling the shape of the sensitivity differs for the two readout methods .",
    "the first point can be explained by a change of the overall shot noise level . when going from heterodyne readout to dc - readout the amplitude spectral density of the overall shot noise level decreases by a factor between @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the exact factor depends on the balancing of the two heterodyne sidebands at the dark - port",
    ". the sensitivity will be increased by between a factor of @xmath6 for balanced sidebands and a factor of @xmath7 for completely unbalanced sidebands .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the individual shot noise contributions at the dark - port . in the heterodyne case",
    "there is additional shot noise contribution from harmonics of the heterodyne frequency . with standard sinusoidal modulation",
    "the significant contribution is at twice the modulation frequency .",
    "the second point can be explained by a change of the optical readout quadrature , which determines the shape of optical gain of the interferometer . the optical gain ( or optical transfer function )",
    "is defined as the transfer function from differential arm length fluctuations to the error signal of the michelson differential arm length servo @xcite .",
    "as one can see in figure  [ fig : shotnoise ] for detuned signal - recycling , the shot noise limited sensitivity increases for frequencies below the signal - recycling tuning frequency and decreases for high frequencies , when going from heterodyne readout to dc - readout .",
    "this corresponds to an increase of the optical gain for frequencies below the signal - recycling tuning frequency and a decrease for high frequencies . in section  [ sec : rotation ] we present measurements confirming this simulated shape - change of the optical response .",
    "carrier light into the output port , serving as new local oscillator ( image 3).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    figure  [ fig : darkport].1 shows an image of the output mode of geo600 , when operated in the normal heterodyne configuration . in the center",
    "there is a strong tem@xmath8 light field of about 25 to 30mw consisting of the rf modulation sidebands that are transmitted to the output via the schnupp asymmetry and serve as local oscillator for the differential arm length control system and the gravitational wave readout .",
    "in addition one can see some higher mode structure , which is mostly made of carrier light originating from asymmetric optical imperfections , such as for instance thermal lensing , inside the main interferometer .    )",
    "is nicely confirmed by experimental results.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in order to realize dc - readout of the differential arm length degree of freedom , the main task is to replace tem@xmath8 rf modulation sidebands as local oscillator by tem@xmath8 carrier light .",
    "we start from the interferometer locked in the nominal heterodyne condition and , in a first step , reduce the amplitude of the rf modulation sidebands by a factor of 10 by turning down the modulation index in lock , while compensating the gain of all control loops that are affected . in this condition",
    "the optical power at the dark port is reduced to about 15mw and dominated by higher - order modes ( see figure  [ fig : darkport].2 ) . in a second step",
    "we introduce an offset into the servo electronics controlling the arm length difference in order to dominate the geo600 output port with tem@xmath8 carrier light ( see figure  [ fig : darkport].3 ) .",
    "this procedure of changing from heterodyne to dc - readout has been automated , and it takes just a few tens of seconds .",
    "a big advantage of our method is that no hardware changes are required . in particular",
    "it allows us to establish a dc - readout scheme without making use of an output mode cleaner which is usually required for removing the heterodyne sidebands from the light impinging on the main photo diode .",
    "the use of an output mode cleaner would allow the heterodyne sidebands to be kept at a high level inside the interferometer .",
    "however , an output mode cleaner is found to be unnecessary in the particular case of geo600 , which has good mode - healing  @xcite , but is likely to be required on other instruments .",
    "an output mode cleaner has the drawback of requiring new hardware together with a low - noise control system as well as introducing additional noise sources and noise couplings .",
    "in order to confirm the simulated shape change of the optical response function for geo600 in detuned signal - recycling mode when changing the readout from heterodyne to homodyne ( see section  [ sec : dec_shape ] ) we have to measure the optical transfer function for the two different cases .",
    "the result of such a measurement for a signal - recycling tuning frequency of 1khz is shown in figure  [ fig : rotation ] .",
    "the shape change of the optical response predicted by simulations is well confirmed by this measurement .        in a next set of measurements we compared the optical transfer function of geo600 with dc - readout for tuned and detuned signal recycling .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sim_vs_meas ] the measured optical responses for both detector configurations , detuned ( light blue trace ) and tuned signal recycling ( orange trace ) agree accurately with the finesse @xcite simulations ( dark blue and red trace ) .",
    "please note that this good agreement is achieved using the standard geo600 parameter set as input for the simulations and no additional fitting or corrections have been applied .",
    "figure  [ fig:550hz_all ] shows a comparison of the nominal geo600 sensitivity from the fifth lsc science run ( blue solid trace ) and the sensitivity that was achieved during first tests of dc - readout ( red solid trace ) for a signal recycling detuning of 550hz . with dc - readout",
    "a peak strain sensitivity of about @xmath9 at frequencies around 500hz is obtained which corresponds to a displacement sensitivity of about @xmath10 .",
    "the solid green and the dashed green traces in figure  [ fig:550hz_all ] represent the simulated shot noise limited sensitivity of geo600 for dc - readout and heterodyne readout , respectively . as expected from the simulations , at high frequencies the sensitivity with dc - readout is worse compared to heterodyne readout",
    "however , the expected benefit from dc - readout , i.e.  the improved shot noise limited sensitivity for frequencies below 700hz is found to be covered by excess noises .",
    "noise projections @xcite revealed that the dc - readout sensitivity is at least partly limited by laser power noise for frequencies below 300hz @xcite .",
    "in addition it has to be noted that the gap bewteen the simulated shot - noise limited sensitivity and the measured sensitivity for dc - readout at high frequncies is partly explained by electronic noise originating from ( so far ) not optimized detection electronics .",
    "the noise sources limiting the peak sensitivity with both , heterodyne and dc - readout , in the frequency band between 300hz and 1khz , are so far unexplained and subject of intense investigation .",
    "we have developed and implemented a dc - readout scheme at the geo600 gravitational wave detector .",
    "this scheme only requires very minor hardware changes , i.e.  in particular no output mode cleaner is required for removing the heterodyne sidebands from the main output port .",
    "we compared the optical response function of geo600 for heterodyne readout and dc - readout as well as for tuned and detuned signal recycling .",
    "the change of the optical response for detuned signal recycling when going from heterodyne to dc - readout , predicted by simulations , was well confirmed by experimental data . with dc - readout",
    "we obtained a strain sensitivity only slightly worse than the nominal geo600 sensitivity with heterodyne readout . at frequencies around 500hz a peak strain sensitivity of @xmath9 is achieved which corresponds to a displacement sensitivity of about @xmath10 .",
    "these encouraging results have led to the decision to change the nominal readout scheme of geo600 from heterodyne to dc - readout in spring 2009 . amongst other hardware changes these upgrades which will mark the transition from geo600 to geo - hf @xcite , will include the installation of a suspended in - vacuum output mode cleaner , whose main purpose is to remove the light from higher - order optical modes . in the medium - future",
    "it is planned to operate the geo detector with tuned signal recycling and dc - readout in combination with the injection of squeezed light ."
