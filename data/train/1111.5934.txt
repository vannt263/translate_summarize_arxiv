    "after the derivation of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator ( npmle ) of a monotone density and a monotone failure rate by grenander  @xcite , and the least squares estimator of a monotone regression function by brunk  @xcite , it has taken some time before the distribution theory for such estimators entered the literature .",
    "the limiting distribution of the npmle of a decreasing density on @xmath3 at a fixed point in the interior of the support , has been established by prakasa rao  @xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained for the npmle of a monotone failure rate in  @xcite and for an estimator of a monotone regression function in  @xcite .",
    "woodroofe and sun  @xcite showed that the npmle of a decreasing density is inconsistent at zero .",
    "the behavior at the boundary has been further investigated in  @xcite .",
    "smooth estimation has been studied in  @xcite , for monotone regression curves , and in  @xcite for monotone densities ; see also  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the limit distribution of the npmle of a decreasing function in the gaussian white noise model was obtained in  @xcite .",
    "related likelihood ratio based techniques have been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "groeneboom  @xcite reproved the result in  @xcite by introducing a new approach based on inverses .",
    "this approach has become a cornerstone in deriving pointwise asymptotics of several shape constrained nonparametric estimators , for example , for the distribution function of interval censored observations ( see  @xcite ) or for estimators of a monotone density and a monotone hazard under random censoring ( see  @xcite ) ; see also  @xcite for the limiting distribution of the npmle of a monotone density under random censoring and  @xcite for similar results on isotonic estimators for a monotone baseline hazard in cox proportional hazards model .",
    "the limit distribution of these estimators involves an argmax process @xmath4 connected with two - sided brownian motion with a parabolic drift .",
    "this process has been studied extensively in  @xcite , where it is also claimed that the approach based on inverses should be sufficiently general to deal with global measures of deviation , such as the @xmath5-distance or the supremum distance between the estimator and the monotone function of interest .",
    "indeed , the limiting distribution of the @xmath5-distance between a decreasing density and its npmle was obtained in  @xcite , and a similar result can be found in  @xcite in the monotone regression setup .",
    "these results were extended to general @xmath6-distances in  @xcite and  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the limiting distribution of @xmath6-distances is obtained in a very general framework that includes , among others , the monotone density case , monotone regression and monotone failure rate .",
    "little to nothing is known about the behavior of the supremum distance . in  @xcite",
    ", the rate of the supremum distance is established in a semi - parametric model for censored observations , and it is suggested that the same rate should hold in the monotone density case . in",
    "@xcite an extremal limit theorem has been obtained for suprema of the process @xmath7 over increasing intervals .",
    "however , a long - standing open problem remains , although this problem has important statistical applications : what is the limiting distribution of the supremum distance between a monotone function and its isotonic estimator ? indeed , while pointwise confidence intervals for a decreasing density , a  monotone regression function or a monotone hazard are available using the limiting distribution of the isotonic estimator at the fixed point , nonparametric confidence bands have remained a formidable challenge ; they could be built if the limiting distribution of the supremum distance between a  monotone function and its isotonic estimator were known .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to settle this question in the same general framework as considered in  @xcite .",
    "the precise construction of a nonparametric confidence band requires additional technicalities that are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "it is only briefly discussed here , and details are deferred to a separate paper .",
    "we consider grenander type estimators @xmath8 for decreasing functions @xmath0 with compact support , say @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "these are estimators that are defined as the left - hand slope of the least concave majorant of an estimator for the primitive of @xmath0 .",
    "this setup includes grenander s  @xcite estimator of a monotone density , brunk s  @xcite estimator for a monotone regression function , as well as the estimator for a monotone failure rate under random censoring , considered in  @xcite .",
    "we obtain the rate of convergence for the supremum of  @xmath9 over subintervals of @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "the rate is shown to be of the order @xmath2 , even on subintervals that grow toward  @xmath1 $ ] , as long as one stays away sufficiently far from the boundaries , so that the inconsistency at the boundaries ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) is not going to dominate the supremum .",
    "the rate that we obtain coincides with the one suggested in  @xcite for grenander s  @xcite estimator for a decreasing density , but it is now proven rigorously in a more general setting under optimal conditions on the boundaries of the intervals over which @xmath10 is taken .",
    "moreover , we show that the rate @xmath2 is sharp .",
    "our main result is theorem  [ theolawfn ] , in which we show that a suitably standardized supremum of @xmath11 converges in distribution to a standard gumbel random variable .",
    "our results are obtained following the same sort of approach as that used in  @xcite , among others .",
    "we first establish corresponding results for the supremum of the inverses of  @xmath8 and  @xmath0 , and then transfer them to the supremum of @xmath8 and @xmath0 themselves . a major difference with deriving asymptotics of @xmath6-distances",
    "is , that in these cases one can benefit from the linearity of the integral and handle several approximations pointwise with markov s inequality .",
    "this is no longer possible with suprema .",
    "with suprema , to transfer results for inverses to results for @xmath12 , a key ingredient is a precise uniform bound on the spacings between consecutive jump points of @xmath12 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secmainresults ]",

    "for instance , we conjecture that , if we consider either the modified estimator in  @xcite or the penalized estimator in  @xcite instead of @xmath12 , then the limit distribution of the supremum distance between this modified estimator and @xmath0 over the whole interval @xmath1 $ ] is the same as the limit distribution of the supremum distance between @xmath43 and @xmath0 over the largest interval allowed in theorem  [ theolawfn ] .",

    "to establish theorems  [ theoratefn ] and  [ theolawfn ] , we use the same approach as in  @xcite .",
