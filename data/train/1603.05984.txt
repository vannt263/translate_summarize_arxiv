    "a self - consistent model of galaxy formation requires an understanding of the relationship between the galactic components , stars and the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and the surrounding gaseous reservoir that extends to the virial radius and beyond , defined roughly as the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) . at redshift @xmath14 , the galactic component is well characterised through observational inference of stellar masses , star formation rates ( sfrs ) , and morphologies .",
    "the corresponding cgm remains much more challenging to characterise , because its diffuse nature generally requires absorption line spectroscopy toward background uv - bright sources .",
    "this significant reservoir of halo gas clearly plays a central role in the cycling of baryons into and out of a galaxy , regulating its growth ; however the details of the galaxy - cgm relationship remain elusive .    until recently ,",
    "uv absorption line spectroscopy could not target low - redshift galactic haloes , because only a small number of quasars were bright enough .",

    "these observations could be confronted with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that included metal enrichment from galactic superwinds to learn how the nucleosynthetic products of star formation enrich the diffuse cgm and igm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "several hst programs have exploited this new capability to investigate the gaseous environments of a sample of low-@xmath15 haloes , including cos - halos @xcite , cos - dwarfs @xcite , and cos - gass @xcite .",

    "the discovery of such a large reservoir of @xmath4-traced metals extending far beyond the stellar disk of the galaxy leads to several questions about the dynamical link between galaxies and their associated cgm .",
    "is there a direct relation between the @xmath4 in haloes and star formation as suggested by the @xmath4-ssfr correlation ?",
    "such a link would imply that typical @xmath0 galaxies are spewing enriched gas in galactic winds out to 150 kpc and beyond in the low-@xmath15 universe . a number of large - volume simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "another possibility is that cgm @xmath4 is not directly attributable to recent star formation or agn activity , and that instead the @xmath4 bimodality arises from a more fundamental relationship . to assess this possibility , we need to ask what is the physical nature of @xmath4 ?",
    "if @xmath4 is predominantly photo - ionized gas at @xmath27 k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "knowledge of the physical cause of the ionization is required to constrain @xmath29 , from which the total mass of oxygen and metals in the cgm is inferred . because the @xmath4-traced cgm mass scales inversely with @xmath29 , far more cgm oxygen would be present if @xmath29 is much lower than the maximal value implied by ionization analyses . hence , it is uncertain how much underlying cgm oxygen the cos - halos @xmath4 observation indicate .    to understand the origin and nature of @xmath4 in a set of haloes hosting galaxies corresponding to those probed by cos - halos , we need cosmological simulations that can simultaneously model the stellar build - up of galaxies , the feedback processes that eject gas from galaxies , and the detailed atomic processes that govern the abundances of the ions observed in the cgm .",

    "our mass distribution is not continuous , and the group - sized haloes are selected to have a large scatter in the baryon fractions within @xmath52 .",

    "even though eagle employs metallicity - dependent yields , this makes negligible difference for the summed oxygen yield .",
    "this value is nearly the same as found by p14 who adopted an oxygen yield of 1.5% for the zero - age main sequence and calculated an average multiple of 1.8 to account for the fact that @xmath224 of the stellar mass survives to @xmath50 , based on @xcite star - formation histories ( i.e. @xmath225 ) .",
    "it is not surprising that these two calculations agree , because we are using similar yields tabulated by @xcite as p14 , and because we are self - consistently following the star - formation histories accounting for stellar evolution    one difference with respect to p14 is that we plot the total oxygen generated by all galaxies residing in the galactic halo , instead of just the central galaxy .",
    "this makes a marginal difference for @xmath0 and sub-@xmath0 galaxies , but the difference is quite noticeable for group - sized haloes since the stellar mass becomes less dominated by the group central ; less than half the stellar mass resides in the central for haloes of @xmath226 .",
    "the ism oxygen content in the 4 largest haloes is contributed almost entirely by satellites .",
    "the stellar oxygen content ( red bars ) follows the p14 trend with @xmath0 and group haloes having similar oxygen fractions in stars ( their figure 12 ) , but our sub-@xmath0 galaxies ( @xmath227 ) have marginally higher stellar oxygen content , which is consistent with the eagle - recal simulation ( s15 ) exhibiting slightly higher stellar metallicities content than inferred observationally by @xcite .",
    "the ism oxygen content increases at lower mass , owing to higher gas fractions ; the stellar mass - ism metallicity relationship ( i.e. the mzr ) in the eagle - recal prescription reproduces the observed decline with mass @xcite . thus far , the agreement is good between our zooms and the observations , because the eagle - recal prescription broadly reproduces the observed metal content of galaxies .",
    "we now report the oxygen contents of the cgm within @xmath52 and additionally between 1 and @xmath228 , which are not nearly as well - constrained by observations ( p14 ) .",

    "nonetheless , our simulated @xmath4 fractions decline at a similar halo mass , @xmath237 , as this simple model predicts , which clearly supports our conclusion that @xmath4 traces the virial temperatures of @xmath0 haloes , and not those of group - sized haloes .",
    "going to sub-@xmath0 haloes , @xmath238 , the simulated haloes do not show a decline in @xmath4 as predicted by the isothermal model , because photo - ionization begins to dominate at these masses .",
    "hence , our second main result from figure [ fig : omass_halo ] is that up to half of the oxygen generated by an @xmath0 galaxy resides outside of @xmath52 in the low-@xmath15 universe .",
    "the implications for galaxy formation models are profound .",
    "not only is the closed - box model of galaxy growth inaccurate due to continuous accretion onto galaxies , the idea that galaxies return products of star formation to extended cgm reservoirs from which they can later re - accrete ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the increase of metals retained in higher mass haloes should be expected as larger haloes have deeper potential wells and physically larger virial radii .",
    "however , the reverse trend may apply because group - sized haloes have more star formation at early times when the universe is physically smaller and halo potentials are shallower , which allow winds to travel to greater comoving distances .",
    "additionally , group - sized haloes contain multiple large galaxies with large satellites more likely to lose their metals from a group halo , because they currently reside further from the halo centre and additionally may have fallen in at late times .",
    "therefore , the moderate increase in metals retained inside @xmath52 from @xmath241 to @xmath242 haloes may represent several competing trends . finally , the space between the top of the faded green bars and the black horizontal line in fig . [ fig : omass_halo ] is oxygen ejected beyond @xmath243 , which usually resides in the low - density igm .",
    "we further investigate the multi - phase structure of the cgm by considering gas pressures at different temperatures .",
    "we plot pressure as a function of halo mass at 0.3 and 1.0 @xmath244 in figure [ fig : mvir_p ] . to calculate a pressure at a given radius and temperature , we take the median cgm gas density with a 0.1 dex spread in radius and temperature , and compute @xmath245 , where @xmath246 is the boltzmann constant",

    ", we colour the circles by temperature and scale their areas in proportion to log(@xmath249 ) , where @xmath250 is the mass within the temperature / radius bin .",
    "the first point to note is that the cgm is multi - phase , especially inside @xmath251 . in the @xmath0 range , there are copious amounts of gas at @xmath146 k ( purple & blue circles ) and @xmath252 k ( yellow , orange , & red circles ) .",
    "very little mass exists at @xmath253 and @xmath28 k ( cyan & green circles ) , because gas cools rapidly through this temperature regime .",
    "when the cooling times become longer at @xmath254 k , gas is at a significantly lower pressure , which indicates this gas is not cooling isobarically . by the time the gas reaches @xmath255 k where cooling times are long , it becomes closer to achieving pressure equilibrium with gas with 100@xmath256 more thermal energy .",
    "thus , the interiors of @xmath0 haloes inhibit long - lived collisionally ionized , @xmath257 k , @xmath4 owing to rapid cooling through the coronal regime , as well as cool , @xmath146 k , @xmath4 owing to high pressures forcing cold gas to densities that are too high to be photo - ionized by the @xcite background .",

    "passive central galaxies with mass @xmath265 reside in higher mass haloes than active galaxies with a similar mass .",

    "it may also be possible that there exists enough freedom in superwind feedback implementations to change @xmath4 columns by a factor of two , while still successfully reproducing the large array of galaxy observables at many redshifts as the eagle prescription does .",

    "hence , this can not explain the @xmath4 shortfall .",
    "a third possibility is that the original cos - halos galaxy - selected sample exhibits malmquist bias , which we can not replicate using smohalos applied to a limited set of zoom haloes .",
    "the cos - halos galaxies were selected photometrically , which can lead to a biased sample of higher star - forming and/or more massive galaxies from a schechter function . while smohalos attempts to match galaxies based on @xmath31 and ssfr , we do not have a large enough sample to reproduce the high sfrs observed in cos - halos @xcite .",

    "whereas cos - halos selects star - forming galaxies from a large cosmic volume , our @xmath0 zooms are selected from a 25 mpc box .",
    "hence , we may not produce the @xmath4 absorption columns observed in cos - halos , because we are not simulating the same galaxies .",

    "@xcite show that @xmath4 can be significantly enhanced by local sources of ionizing radiation , but only within 50 kpc using a 100% escape fraction for soft x - rays from a sfr=10@xmath69 galaxy , which are unrealistic assumptions for cos - halos .    however , we suggest the possibility that photo - ionization of @xmath4 could be part of the solution , owing to fluctuating agn `` flash '' ionizing their cgm . @xcite",
    "introduced the concept of agn proximity zone fossils , where `` cool '' @xmath286 k gas is ionized by a halo s central agn that subsequently turns off leaving the surrounding cgm over - ionized for a time similar to the recombination timescale of diffuse gas , which can equal or exceed the typical time between agn episodes .",
    "they showed that seyfert - level agn that are on for 10% of the time can enhance @xmath4 levels by @xmath287 dex after the agn _ turns off_. the effect may be particularly relevant for cool metals at @xmath288 where cgm metals exist in our simulations , and the relevant recombination timescales for @xmath4 range from @xmath289 myrs .",

    "we explore the role of agn by running a @xmath183 group halo without agn feedback , finding that it produces similar @xmath4 column densities at @xmath22 kpc ( @xmath329 ) as our standard group haloes with agn feedback .",
    "hence , the bimodality of circumgalactic @xmath4 column densities with ssfr does not owe to the removal of mass and metals from the haloes of galaxies with more active black holes , but is clearly an ionization effect of reduced @xmath29 in hot haloes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : agn_noagn ] ) .    in our simulations , the higher @xmath4 column densities around star - forming galaxies compared with passive galaxies are due to their virial temperatures being more favorable for a high @xmath4 fraction rather than to higher total oxygen column densities .",
    "a key test of this explanation would be to observe our prediction of the greater total oxygen content in the cgm of higher mass haloes , where @xmath4 is no longer an effective tracer of cgm oxygen . observing the soft x - ray ions @xmath12 and @xmath231 out to the virial radius is beyond the scope of current facilities , although we will make predictions for upcoming facilities in future work . unfortunately , absorption lines capable of tracing @xmath10 k metals are at extreme uv energies , which shifts them out of the cos wavelength coverage at low redshift .",
    "our model contrasts with that of @xcite , who predict that agn blow more baryons out of haloes around passive than star - forming galaxies , and therefore will not predict more metals at @xmath330 kpc around passive galaxies . alternatively ,",
    "photo - ionization by galactic sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instead predicts that the @xmath4 bearing material would exist in @xmath27 k gas around galaxies .",
    "our results indicate that @xmath4 acts as a sensitive thermometer of halo gas , such that the @xmath4 column density around star - forming and passive galaxies informs more about temperature than about the oxygen mass .",

    "we also used the intermediate - sized ref - l050n0752 box to find @xmath362 ( @xmath364 ) for 294 ( 52 ) @xmath0 ( group ) haloes .",
    "however , it must be noted that this sample includes _ all _ the haloes in 0.6 dex @xmath99 bins , which biases each bin to be dominated by haloes at the lower mass end of the bin ( where there are more haloes ) as opposed to the zooms chosen to more evenly sample the masses within these bins .",
    "indeed , making the @xmath99 bins smaller ( 0.3 dex wide ) in ref - l050n0752 , leads to a slightly greater decline from @xmath365 to @xmath363 .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath4 columns are considerably smaller at ref resolution , which is again apparent when we look at all @xmath0 haloes in recal - l025n0752 finding @xmath366 , which is 0.26 dex higher than for ref - l025n0376 .",
    "this supports the findings of @xcite where significantly more high @xmath4 columns ( @xmath367 ) occur in recal - l025n0752 than in the ref lower resolution simulations .",
    "while group halo @xmath4 columns appear to not change much in the weak convergence limit , the @xmath4 columns in @xmath0 haloes are significantly higher in the recal simulations , which affects both cos - halos type observations and global igm observations @xcite .    * noagn simulations : * finally , we consider the noagn - l050n0752 run ( _ m6.2 _ resolution ) , and find log[@xmath368 @xmath369 ( @xmath370 ) for @xmath0 ( group ) haloes , which compares to @xmath362 ( @xmath364 ) in ref - l050n0752 .",
