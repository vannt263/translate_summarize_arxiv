    "so for the diagram in ( 3 ) to commute , we must have @xmath60 .",
    "incidentally , exactly the same proof shows also that ( 2 ) implies ( 4 ) .",
    "finally , the implication ( 4 ) @xmath61(2),(3 ) follows from two standard facts about abelian groups :    * any abelian group can be embedded into a divisible abelian group , * and any homomorphism from a subgroup @xmath62 of an abelian group @xmath63 to a divisible group @xmath64 extends to a homomorphism from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath36 is trivial on @xmath32 , it induces a homomorphism from @xmath65 , which is canonically identified with a subgroup of @xmath66 .",

    "it follows from the last part of the proof that if @xmath5 is divisible , then @xmath52 can be taken to be equal to @xmath5 in proposition [ prop : factorisability ] . also , if @xmath33 is trivial , then @xmath69 , and again @xmath52 can be taken to be equal to @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath5 is the group of fractional ideals of a number field @xmath16 , and if @xmath36 vanishes on @xmath32 , then @xmath52 can always be taken to be the group of fractional ideals of a suitable galois extension @xmath18 , so this is not an additional restriction .",
    "indeed , a sufficient condition on @xmath52 is that elements of @xmath65 that are @xmath70-divisible in @xmath29 are mapped under @xmath36 to elements of @xmath5 that become @xmath70-divisible in @xmath52 .",
    "so if @xmath5 is the group of fractional ideals of a number field @xmath16 , this condition translates into relative ramification indices of some integral ideals of @xmath0 being divisible by some integers , and some elements of @xmath16 having certain @xmath70-th roots in @xmath0 .    in @xcite ,",

    "it follows that two modules that are locally isomorphic at all primes @xmath80 are factor equivalent .",
    "the above definition is the one usually appearing in the literature , but it will be convenient for us to follow @xcite in defining factor equivalence for @xmath4$]-modules that are not necessarily @xmath3-free :    let @xmath2 be a group , and let @xmath71 , @xmath72 be two @xmath4$]-modules such that there is an isomorphism of @xmath73$]-modules @xmath83 .",

    "<S> we compare two approaches to the study of galois module structures : on the one hand factor equivalence , a technique that has been used by frhlich and others to investigate the galois module structure of rings of integers of number fields and of their unit groups , and on the other hand regulator constants , a set of invariants attached to integral group representations by dokchitser and dokchitser , and used by the author , among others , to study galois module structures . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the two approaches are in fact closely related , and interpret results arising from these two approaches in terms of each other . </S>",
    "<S> we then use this comparison to derive a factorisability result on higher @xmath0-groups of rings of integers , which is a direct analogue of a theorem of de smit on @xmath1-units . </S>"
