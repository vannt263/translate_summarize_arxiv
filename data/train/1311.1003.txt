    "in spite of the general consensus on the hierarchical model for the formation of galaxies , the details on their growth and assembly are still unclear .",
    "for example , in the case of elliptical galaxies , we do not know whether their assembly occurs preferentially via dry merging , involving mostly stars , or wet merging , involving stars and gas , accompanied by star formation ( e.g.  @xcite ) . according to @xcite , these two modalities could lead to a dichotomy in several properties of this kind of galaxies , including , e.g. , the formation of disky ellipticals when wet merging is dominant , or boxy ellipticals in the opposite case , as well as other observational evidences @xcite .",
    "other scenarios consider the occurrence of wet merging preferentially at high redshift , followed by prevailing dry merging at lower redshift @xcite . alternatively",
    ", the formation process could be characterized by two main phases , with in - situ star formation producing the inner regions at early epochs , followed by the growth of the external parts of the galaxies via dry merging . in this model",
    "the importance of the latter mechanism increases with galaxy size . +",
    "different formation paths imprint upon different metallicity distributions and gradients over the galactic radii .",
    "for example , in the case of wet merging , the gas should deposit in the central regions of the accreting galaxy , where the last star formation episode would occur .",
    "this process leads to the construction of sizable metallicity gradients , with metal rich stars dominating the central parts of the galaxy .",
    "conversely , a prevalence of dry merging would result into a quite flat metallicity gradient , the accreted galaxies being disrupted and their members mixed to the accretor s stars .",
    "therefore , the observational determination of metallicity distributions and metallicity gradients in ellipticals provide strong constraints on their formation models .",
    "this problem has been investigated through the analysis of integrated colors and line indices gradients in galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies support the notion that dry merging is indeed important in the formation of ellipticals , but the actual size of the metallicity gradients and its trend with galaxy size are a matter of debate .",
    "in addition , the integrated light can only yield a global information on the metallicity , and this information is necessarily weighted by luminosity , which favors the younger stellar generations .",
    "conversely , tight constraints on the formation models could be obtained from the detailed study of metallicity distribution , its peak and extension , and its trend with radius .",
    "an efficient way to measure the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) involves the analysis of the color distribution of stars on the red giant branch ( rgb ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "rgb stars are intrinsically very bright , and are produced by stellar populations with an extremely large range of ages , older than @xmath6 gyr up to the hubble time .",
    "therefore , this component of the stellar population samples almost the whole star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "although the color of the rgb stars also depends on their age , the sensitivity to metallicity is much more pronounced , so that the width of the rgb is often used to derive the width of the metallicity distribution of a stellar population .",
    "individual spectroscopy for bright rgb stars ( @xmath7 ) can not be performed even for the ellipticals nearest to us , leaving the photometric method as the only means to access the metallicity distribution .",
    "a thorough study of this kind has been performed for the nearby elliptical galaxy centaurus a ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , through the analysis of cmds obtained from hst data in different regions of the galaxy , sampling the stellar populations from @xmath8 8 to @xmath8 38 kpc from the center .",
    "the results show that the metallicity distribution is very wide in all the examined fields , with very little variations of the peak and width .",
    "however , single star photometry in the inner regions is hampered by crowding ; the innermost field studied in centaurus a is located at 8 kpc from the center , corresponding to 1.5 times the effective radius ( @xmath9 ) , leaving unexplored most of the stellar mass of the galaxy .        with the exquisite resolving power of the future 40 m class european - extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) @xcite working close to the diffraction limit , thanks to the laser guide stars ( lgs ) assisted multi - conjugate adaptive optics ( mcao ) , it will be possible to perform accurate photometry of bright rgb stars in extremely crowded fields , down to the inner regions of galaxies and to map the metallicity distribution over the whole ellipticals . with the e - elt we will be able to study galaxies beyond the centaurus group , and in particular access members of the virgo cluster , enabling the comparison of the metallicity distribution in a suitable sample of galaxies located in different environments .",
    "this paper builds on @xcite in which this problem was explored , leading to the encouraging result that the uncertainty on the metallicity of a bright rgb star amounts to @xmath10 0.1 dex at approximately 0.5 effective radii in a typical elliptical in virgo .",
    "here we expand the investigation to quantify how the accuracy varies with star crowding , from the central parts , up to @xmath10 2 @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , we add the discussion of the effect on the results of the small variations of the point spread function ( psf ) across the whole micado ( multi - ao imaging camera for deep observations ) field of view ( fov ) due to the non - uniformity of the mcao correction and to variation of seeing conditions .",
    "the expected performance of an elt for photometry in crowded fields has been investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these papers aim at quantifying in general the photometric accuracy and its variation with crowding . here",
    "we address a specific scientific issue , assessing the accuracy with which the metallicity distribution can be derived , which degrades with crowding .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : section2 ] we describe how the simulated frames were produced , detailing in particular the adopted psf ( sect .",
    "[ sect : inputpsf ] ) , while in sect .",
    "[ analysis ] we exemplify how the synthetic images were reduced . in sect .",
    "[ results ] we report our results : the quality of the photometric measurements ( sect .",
    "[ sect : photoerror ] ) , the derived cmds ( sect .",
    "[ cmd ] ) , and the mdf resulting from the analysis of the rgb stars ( sect .  [ mdf ] ) .",
    "the comparison of this mdf to the input one clearly illustrates the feasibility of the considered science case . in sect .",
    "[ abc ] we discuss how the results change when considering a non - optimal psf .",
    "a summary of our results is presented in sect .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "in this paper we focus on the problem of deriving the stellar metallicity distribution in different parts of a giant elliptical galaxy member of the virgo cluster by means of simulated star fields . at a distance of 18 mpc , the brightest stars of an old stellar population , which are at the tip of the rgb , have @xmath11 mag . for our simulations",
    "we adopt the same model stellar population as in @xcite , namely a flat age distribution between 10 and 12 gyr , and a metallicity distribution determined for a halo field in the elliptical galaxy centaurus a @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details on the model computations ; we recall here only some properties of the stellar population : the ratio between the mass of formed stars and current @xmath12 band luminosity is @xmath13 ; integrated colors are @xmath12 - @xmath14 = 0.88 ; @xmath12 - @xmath15 = 1.97 ; @xmath12 - @xmath16 = 3.66 .    on the cmds of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] , the different metallicity bins appear well separated , thereby illustrating the diagnostic of the color of rgb stars . comparing the left to the central panel",
    "one can appreciate the superior sensitivity to metallicity of the @xmath15 - @xmath17 with respect to the @xmath17 - @xmath16 color , because the wider wavelength baseline better traces the stellar effective temperature .",
    "the quality of the metallicity distribution derived from the cmd will depend on the photometric errors affecting the color distribution of the stars , that depend on crowding conditions .",
    "we map quantitatively this effect by placing the stellar population at different locations within the galaxy , i.e. at different surface brightness levels .",
    "real galaxies could be characterized by a systematic trend of the metallicity distribution with galactic radius ; however we do not attempt to incorporate this variation in our modeling , since we aim at evaluating how crowding affects our capability of recovering a given metallicity distribution from photometry of the resolved stars in the galaxy .      the first light imaging system currently foreseen for the future 40 m class e - elt will consist of a high resolution camera ( micado , @xcite ) coupled with maory ( multi - conjugate adaptive optics relay @xcite ) , an lgs assisted mcao module",
    ".    the micado camera , optimized for imaging at the diffraction limit , will fully sample the 6 ( 11 ) mas psf core fwhm in the @xmath17 ( @xmath16 ) bands ; it requires an image correction of high quality and uniformity across a fov of @xmath18 arcsec on the wavelength range 0.8 - 2.4  @xmath19 m . a good uniformity of the high resolution psf across the fov is ensured by the maory mcao module by means of several deformable mirrors , optically conjugated to different turbulent layers , and several guide stars , to obtain a kind of 3-dimensional mapping of the turbulence .",
    "the maory phase a baseline takes advantage of a constellation of 6 lgs and 3 natural guide stars ( ngs ) for the turbulence sensing , following the choice adopted in other mcao systems for present and future telescopes , like gems on gemini @xcite and nfiraos @xcite on the future thirty meter telescope ( tmt , @xcite ) .",
    "mcao was successfully demonstrated on - sky by the multi conjugate adaptive optics demonstrator ( mad ) on the very large telescope ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and by gems on gemini @xcite .       arcsec . ]    the psfs for the synthetic images have been downloaded from the maory official website .",
    "the maory psf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] shows an example in the @xmath17 band ) presents a very complex shape , where the main central component has the typical shape of the airy disk , and the secondary structures can be attributed to the mcao system characteristics .",
    "the secondary peaks arranged in a quasi - hexagonal configuration mirror the constellation of the 6 lgss ; the big external square reflects the density and the displacement of the deformable mirrors actuators , and the external halo is produced by residual light due to the non - perfect correction of the turbulence .    in order to map the psf variations across the fov , model psfs are computed on a polar grid of directions ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] ) . for each photometric band and point of the grid they are available for two seeing atmospheric conditions : `` median seeing '' condition ( fwhm @xmath20 arcsec at 0.5 @xmath19 m ) and `` good seeing '' condition ( fwhm @xmath21 arcsec ) .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] shows the trend of the predicted maory psf strehl ratio ( sr ) with distance from the center of the fov .",
    "the sr is the ratio of the maximum intensity in the psf to that in the theoretically perfect point source image ( airy disk ) and it is a tracer of the image quality after ao correction .",
    "the performance across the micado fov is remarkably uniform , due to the multi - conjugation of the ao correction .",
    "arcsec micado fov .",
    "colored dots mark the positions of the two psfs considered to evaluate the dependence of the results from spatial psf variations .",
    "the colored squares show the size of the widest of our simulated images . ]",
    "[ fig : f5 ] shows two examples of the model maory psf in the @xmath17 band under `` good seeing '' conditions , in the two locations on the fov shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] by the two colored filled circles .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] exemplifies the maximum expected variation of the psf on the micado fov .",
    "we explore the sensitivity of our results on psf variations by computing two sets of simulated images , adopting the model `` good seeing '' psfs in the two locations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] .",
    "in addition , we compute a third set of frames using the `` median seeing '' psf in the center of the fov .",
    "since the psf variation across the whole micado fov is very low , we assumed a fixed psf for each simulated frame .    , @xmath22 , @xmath17 and @xmath15 bands and for a seeing value of 0.6 arcsec ( continuous lines ) and 0.8 arcsec ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the vertical thick dashed line represents the distance from the center to the corner of the micado fov .",
    "this plot depicts the typical behavior of the sr when ao is employed : the best correction level and image quality is reached at the center of the fov , both degrading as the radial distance increases . ]",
    "[ fig : f5 ]          the images have been simulated using the aetc tool @xcite with the e - elt micado configuration .",
    "we recall in table  [ tab : table1 ] all the relevant parameters of the telescope and of the instrument we have considered , as well as the observation conditions .",
    ".relevant parameters of the telescope and of the instrument given to the simulator to generate the synthetic frames .",
    "we assumed the typical near - ir sky background at paranal ( chile ) and included the contribution of thermal emission in the near - ir bands . [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig : f18 ] illustrates the photometric quality as a function of the input magnitudes in the @xmath15 and @xmath17 bands .",
    "we recall that the surface brightness ( i.e. crowding ) is fixed .",
    "note that the error curves for the three cases almost overlap along the whole magnitude range in both bands .",
    "indeed the accuracy of the psf extraction is more affected by the crowding rather than the sr .",
    "a marginal increase of the negative error in cases with lower sr ( b and c ) can be noticed at faint @xmath15 magnitudes ( @xmath23 29 mag ) .",
    "this is probably due to the enhancement of the blending effect whereby a larger fraction of the flux is contained within the psf halo .",
    "+ the above considerations reflect into the ( @xmath17 , @xmath15 - @xmath17 ) cmds appearance of the three cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f19 ] .",
    "the effect of the sr degradation on the color separation of different metallicity bins seems to be negligible , while it affects significantly the cmds depth .",
    "[ fig : f21 ] compares the input metallicity distribution to the one derived following the procedure described in sect .",
    "[ mdf ] for cases b and c. we found that the overall shape of the two distributions is again quite similar . even the r.m.s . of the errors on the metallicity estimation as a function of magnitude ( colored lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : f20 ] ) in cases b and c are slightly larger with respect to case a , but comparable within @xmath10 0.05 dex .",
    "+ we may conclude that the considered cases of psf sr degradation do not influence the accuracy with which we can recover the mdf in a virgo elliptical in regions with a surface brightness fainter than @xmath24 mag arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "this confirms the feasibility of our science case .",
    "in this paper we investigated the expected performance reached by next generation large aperture telescopes for the photometric study of resolved stellar population in distant galaxies .",
    "this work focus on the capabilities of deriving the metallicity distribution of stellar populations in distant galaxies using the future e - elt high resolution imager micado .",
    "in particular we quantified the impact of the photometric errors on the metallicity distribution derived from the color distribution of rgb stars , and of its systematics with different crowding conditions .",
    "this uncertainty is in addition to that related to the age - metallicity degeneracy and inadequacies of the stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "we have shown that the exquisite spatial resolution offered by the e - elt working close to the diffraction limit , will allow us to perform accurate photometry of bright rgb stars in extremely crowded fields , down to the inner regions of galaxies .",
    "it will be therefore possible to map the metallicity distribution across practically an entire elliptical galaxy , with a modest resolution ( @xmath10 0.5 dex ) in the central regions . at larger radii the resolution improves , becoming @xmath10 0.1 dex at the effective radius and even better in the external regions .",
    "we produced synthetic frames in the @xmath15 , @xmath17 , @xmath22 and @xmath25 bands at different surface brightness levels ( @xmath26 ) assuming the expected psf of the micado camera assisted by the maory mcao module .",
    "we used different psfs computed under different assumptions of seeing conditions and ao performance across the micado fov .",
    "the generated frames have been analyzed using starfinder , a program specifically designed for high resolution ao images .",
    "the photometric accuracy has been evaluated for each band and for each crowding condition , matching the input and output stellar lists . as in @xcite",
    ", we found that blending of stellar sources in most crowded fields leads to an asymmetrical error distribution , and to a general migration of star counts along the luminosity function towards the brighter bins .",
    "our analysis has shown that :    * stellar photometry in crowded fields of distant galaxies is feasible with an accuracy of @xmath27 mag at @xmath28 @xmath9(@xmath1 = 21.6 mag arcsec@xmath2 ) and with an accuracy of @xmath29 mag at @xmath30 @xmath9(@xmath1 = 20.5 mag arcsec@xmath2 ) down to @xmath31 27.7 mag .",
    "this allows studies of resolved stellar populations in the inner regions of elliptical galaxies up to the distance of the virgo cluster ; * the luminosity function on the upper two magnitudes of the rgb is well determined for surface brightness levels fainter than @xmath32 20.5 mag arcsec@xmath2 ( corresponding to @xmath33 ) ; * at @xmath34 mag arcsec@xmath2 the completeness becomes independent of surface brightness in all the bands , indicating that below this level , the source detection is no longer limited by crowding ; * the photometric errors introduce an uncertainty @xmath35 0.2 dex in the determination of the peak of the metallicity distribution in regions with a surface brightness fainter than @xmath24 mag arcsec@xmath2 ; at this surface brightness level the photometric errors for stars brighter than @xmath36 mag induce a typical accuracy of @xmath10 0.1 dex on the photometric metallicity ; * when considering a non optimal psf , such as the one obtained in worse seeing condition or at the edge of the imaging camera fov , it is still possible to retrieve the metallicity distribution with an accuracy similar to the one recovered assuming the best psf , while the cmds become less deep .",
