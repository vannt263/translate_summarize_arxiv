    "in recent experiments on nuclear reactions induced by photons nakano , stepanyan , kubarovsky , barth , airapetian , kaons @xcite , and neutrinos @xcite , production of baryons consisting of five quarks @xmath8 has been inferred from the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the extracted mass is around @xmath11 gev with a width in the range @xmath12-@xmath13 mev except ref.@xcite which gives a width of @xmath14 mev .",
    "all these widths reflect the resolution in the experiments , so the actual width of @xmath15 is expected to be smaller .",
    "the observed properties of this pentaquark baryon are consistent with those of the @xmath15 baryon with spin @xmath16 , isospin @xmath17 , and strangeness @xmath18 that was originally predicted by the chiral soliton model @xcite and recently studied using the skyrme model prasz , polyakov , walliser , jennings , borisyuk , itzhaki , the constituent quark model @xcite , the chiral quark model @xcite , the qcd sum rules @xcite , and the lattice qcd sasaki , ciskor",
    ". studies of the @xmath15 production mechanism in these reactions have also been carried out @xcite . since",
    "both kaon and nucleon numbers are not insignificant in the hadronic matter formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions , the @xmath15 may also be produced in these collisions . using a statistical model , which assumes that the @xmath19 is in chemical equilibrium with other hadrons ,",
    "randrup @xcite has estimated its abundance and finds that there is about one @xmath15 per unit rapidity in central au+au collisions at @xmath20 gev available from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . as the quark - gluon plasma is expected to be formed in the initial stage of heavy ion collisions at rhic , and it was suggested that formation of the quark - gluon plasma would enhance the production of hadrons consisting of strange quarks @xcite , it is of interest to know if this is also the case for @xmath15 production and to determine its production from the quark - gluon plasma relative to that from the hadronic matter .    in this letter ,",
    "@xmath0 production in central heavy ion collisions at rhic is studied in a kinetic model that starts from the final stage of the quark - gluon plasma , goes through a mixed phase of quark - gluon and hadronic matters , and finally undergoes hadronic expansion .",
    "the production of @xmath1 from the quark - gluon plasma is modeled by the coalescence model , which has been shown to describe quite well not only the particle yields and their ratios @xcite but also their transverse momentum spectra greco , hwa , fries .",
    "production and absorption of @xmath0 in the hadronic matter are taken into account via the reactions @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "we find that the number of @xmath0 produced from the quark - gluon plasma is appreciable and the final @xmath0 number after the hadronic phase remains sensitive to the initial number of @xmath0 produced from the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "furthermore , a slightly smaller number of its antiparticle @xmath21 is also expected to be produced at rhic as a result of small baryon chemical potential in the matter produced from these collisions .",
    "we note that the quark coalescence model has also been used recently to study in heavy ion collisions at rhic the elliptic flow of @xmath0 @xcite , i.e. , the azimuthal anisotropy of their momentum distribution in the plane perpendicular to the beam directions .",
    "to model the dynamics of central relativistic heavy ion collisions after the end of the quark - gluon plasma phase , we use the boost invariant picture of bjorken @xcite augmented with accelerated transverse expansion .",
    "specifically , the volume of produced fireball is taken to evolve with the proper time according to @xcite @xmath22 ^{2}\\tau c,\\]]where @xmath23 fm and @xmath24 fm/@xmath25 are final transverse and longitudinal sizes of the quark - gluon plasma , corresponding to a volume of @xmath26 @xmath27 in central au+au collisions at @xmath28 gev .",
    "taking the critical temperature to be @xmath29 mev and a transverse flow velocity @xmath30 , the total transverse energy of quarks and gluons in the midrapidity ( @xmath31 ) is then about @xmath32 gev , if we take quarks and gluons to be massive with @xmath33 mev , @xmath34 mev and @xmath35 mev in order to take into account the nonperturbative effects of qcd near critical temperature @xcite , and to have chemical potentials @xmath36 mev and @xmath37 to account for observed final antibaryon to baryon ratio at rhic .",
    "the above total transverse energy includes a bag energy of about @xmath38 gev based on a bag constant of about @xmath39 mev/@xmath27 , which is determined from the pressure difference between the quark - gluon plasma and the hadronic matter at @xmath40 . requiring that final hadronic matter freezes out at temperature @xmath41 mev and has a transverse flow velocity of @xmath42 , as extracted from measured hadron spectra in these collisions",
    ", then leads to a freeze out volume @xmath43 @xmath27 if we assume that the fireball expands isentropically .",
    "the resulting total transverse energy of final hadronic matter is @xmath44 gev and is comparable to that of midrapidity hadrons measured in experiments @xcite .",
    "it is , however , less than the initial transverse energy of midrapidity quarks and gluons .",
    "this is consistent with the reduction of midrapidity hadrons and their total transverse energy as a result of hadronic rescatterings seen in studies based on the transport model @xcite . because of the small pressure near phase transition and in hadronic matter @xcite , acceleration in the transverse expansion is chosen to have a small value @xmath45 @xmath46/fm in order to obtain a lifetime of the expanding matter comparable to that from the transport model .",
    "as the quark - gluon plasma expands , it gradually converts to hadrons leading to a mixed phase of quark - gluon plasma and hadronic matter at constant temperature @xmath47 .",
    "the fraction of hadronic matter @xmath48 can be determined by requiring that the total entropy @xmath49 of the fireball remains constant during the phase transition kajantie , i.e. , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the entropy densities of hadronic matter and quark - gluon plasma , respectively , which we treat as noninteracting ideal gases with finite transverse flow .",
    "the mixed phase ends at time @xmath53 fm/@xmath25 when @xmath54 reaches one , and the resulting pure hadronic matter is also assumed to expand isentropically until @xmath55 fm/@xmath56 when its temperature drops to @xmath57 mev . in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig.[voltem ] , we show the resulting time evolution of the volume and temperature of mid - rapidity particles in au+au collisions at @xmath28 gev .     gev . ]    for normal hadrons such as pions , kaons , and nucleons , we take them to be in chemical equilibrium with baryon chemical potential @xmath58 , charge chemical potential @xmath59 , and strangeness chemical potential @xmath60 , similar to those of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "since the chemical potentials vary weakly with the temperature of an isentropically expanding matter in heavy ion collisions at rhic energies @xcite , we neglect their time dependence . evaluating the densities of these hadrons using the relativistic boltzmann distributions with inclusion of transverse flow , the time evolution of their abundance",
    "is shown in panel ( c ) of fig.[voltem ] .",
    "we note that the final numbers of pions , kaons , and nucleons at freeze out including contributions from decays of resonances are comparable to those measured in experiments .",
    "the number of @xmath61 baryons that are produced from the quark - gluon plasma can be estimated using the coalescence model @xcite , i.e. , given by the product of a statistical factor @xmath62 , which denotes the probability of combining @xmath63 quarks into a color neutral , spin @xmath64 , and isospin @xmath65 hadronic state , and the overlap of the quark phase - space distribution function @xmath66 with the wigner distribution function @xmath67 of @xmath15 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the probability of converting the above hadronic state into @xmath0 and depends on the quark spatial wave functions in the @xmath0 .",
    "explicitly , the @xmath0 number is expressed as @xmath68with @xmath69 denoting an element of a space - like hypersurface . since the coalescence model can be viewed as formation of bound states from interacting particles with energy mismatch balanced by other particles in the system , neglecting such off - shell effects",
    "is reasonable if the binding energy is not large as in the case of @xmath15 and/or if the production process is fast compared to the inverse of the binding energy .",
    "we note that the @xmath61 is produced from the quark - gluon plasma during its hadronization and thus exists only in the resulting hadronic matter .",
    "to determine the statistical factor @xmath62 , we note that the quark wave function of @xmath0 in the color - spin - isospin space can be expressed as a linear combination of all possible orthogonal flavor , color , and spin basis states , with coefficients depending on the quark model used for @xmath0 , e. g. , see @xcite . since these coefficients are normalized to one , the probability for the five quarks and antiquark @xmath70 to form a hadron with quantum numbers corresponding to a spin up @xmath0 is simply given by the probability of finding these quarks in any one of these color - spin - isopin basis states , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "including also the possibility of forming a spin - down @xmath0 doubles the probability . as a result ,",
    "the probability factor is @xmath72 .    for the phase - space distribution function of quarks",
    ", we assume that they are uniformly distributed in the transverse plane and their momentum distributions are relativistic boltzmannian in the transverse direction but uniform in rapidity along the longitudinal direction . imposing also the bjorken correlation of equal spatial ( @xmath73 ) and momentum ( @xmath74 )",
    "rapidities , then the quark momentum distribution per unit rapidity is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the color - spin degeneracy of a quark .",
    "the wigner distribution function of @xmath15 depends on its internal quark wave functions . for simplicity , we take it to be gaussian in space and momentum , i.e. , @xmath77where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the relative spatial and momentum coordinates of the five quarks in @xmath15 , and are related to @xmath80 and @xmath81 by the normal jacobian transformation , i.e. , @xmath82and similarly for the momentum space coordinates . the width parameter @xmath83 for the @xmath84-th relative coordinate is defined as @xmath85 with @xmath86    carrying out the spatial integrations in eq.([coal ] ) , the number of @xmath87 produced from the coalescence of @xmath63 quarks is then @xmath88 in the above , @xmath89 are the four relative momenta defined previously but determined in the center - of - mass of formed pentaquark , and @xmath90 are transverse masses of the quarks . the numbers of @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 quarks in the quark - gluon plasma with rapidities @xmath31 are denoted , respectively , by @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 ; and @xmath97 is the width parameter calculated according to the mass @xmath98 of the light quark . at @xmath99",
    "their values are @xmath100 and @xmath101 , if we take into account the effect of gluons by converting them to quarks according to the quark flavor composition in the quark - gluon plasma as in ref.@xcite .",
    "the width parameter @xmath97 in the @xmath15 wigner distribution function is related to the size of @xmath87 .",
    "since the latter is not known empirically , we thus choose the value of @xmath97 to fit the proton root - mean - square radius with the harmonic oscillator wave functions , i.e. , @xmath102 fm @xcite , corresponding to a @xmath19 root - mean - square radius @xmath103    evaluating numerically the transverse mass integrals in eq.([number ] ) using the monte carlo method introduced in ref.@xcite , we find that the number of @xmath15 produced in one unit of rapidity is about @xmath104 .",
    "compared to predictions from the statistical model , this number is smaller than that estimated in ref.@xcite by about a factor five and that from a more recent analysis @xcite by about a factor two .",
    "the coalescence model also allows us to evaluate the number @xmath105 of neutral hyperons @xmath106 and @xmath107 as well as those from decays of @xmath108 and @xmath109 that are produced from the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the resulting number is about @xmath110 .",
    "although this is about a factor of two smaller than that measured in au+au collisions at @xmath111 gev star , including contributions from resonance decays and production in the hadronic matter is expected to bring it closer to the experimental data . in deriving eq.([number ] ) , we have neglected the effect of transverse flow on the quark momentum distributions . including this effect makes the spatial integrals in eq.([coal ] ) more involved . evaluating them by the monte carlo method , we find that its effect on produced @xmath15 number is small .",
    "it is interesting to note that the momentum integrals , i.e. , the last factor in eq.([number ] ) , can be evaluated analytically if the quark momentum distributions are non - relativistic , leading to the expression @xmath112 .",
    "this gives a @xmath15 number of 0.64 , which is about a factor of @xmath113 larger than the relativistic case .",
    "the abundance of @xmath0 can change during subsequent evolution of the hadronic matter as a result of hadronic absorption and production . in hadronic matter",
    ", @xmath0 can be produced as a resonance from interactions of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the cross section for this process is given by the breit - wigner formula .",
    "it can also be produced from reactions like @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "cross sections for these reactions can be estimated by considering @xmath118 as a @xmath119channel and @xmath117 as an @xmath120channel nucleon - pole diagram . using the coupling constant @xmath121 , determined from the width of @xmath1 which we take to be @xmath122 mev , we have evaluated these cross sections with empirical form factors .",
    "details of this calculation can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 can be destroyed in the hadronic matter either by decay , i.e. , @xmath123 , or by the inverse reactions @xmath124 and @xmath125 with cross sections related to those of production cross sections via the detailed balance relations .",
    "we have also evaluated the thermal average of @xmath15 production and absorption cross sections . in the temperature range",
    "@xmath126-@xmath127 mev of interest here , their values for production cross sections are about @xmath128 mb for @xmath129 , @xmath130 mb for @xmath131 , and @xmath128-@xmath132 @xmath133b for @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the relative velocity of two initial hadrons and @xmath136 denotes the average over their momentum distributions . for @xmath15 absorption cross sections , they are about @xmath137 mb for @xmath138 and @xmath139 mb for @xmath140 .",
    "the cross sections are thus larger for @xmath87 production reactions induced by @xmath114 than @xmath141 and also for @xmath87 absorption than production reactions as a result of large @xmath87 mass .    in terms of thermal averaged cross sections and the densities of pions ( @xmath142 ) , kaons ( @xmath143 ) , antikaons ( @xmath144 ) , and nucleons ( @xmath145 ) , the time evolution of @xmath15 abundance @xmath146",
    "is determined by the kinetic equation @xcite,@xmath147since hadronization of the quark - gluon plasma takes a finite time of @xmath148 fm/@xmath25 , we expect @xmath15 to be produced continuously from the quark - gluon plasma in the mixed phase , with a rate proportional to the volume of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this is included in the first term @xmath149 of above equation .",
    "abundance in au+au collisions at @xmath150 gev for different initial numbers of @xmath15 produced from the quark - gluon plasma as well as different @xmath87 width . ]    using the time evolution of volume , temperature , and hadron abundance shown in fig.[voltem ] , the resulting time evolution of @xmath15 abundance is shown in fig.[mult](a ) .",
    "the solid curve is obtained with @xmath104 initial @xmath15 from the quark - gluon plasma as given by the coalescence model discussed in the above .",
    "it is seen that the final @xmath19 number is enhanced to @xmath151 . to see how the final @xmath15 number depends on its number produced from the quark - gluon plasma",
    ", we have repeated the above calculation with different numbers of initial @xmath152 baryons . as shown in fig.[mult](a ) , the final @xmath15 number is about @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively , for @xmath65 ( dotted curve ) and @xmath155 ( dashed curve ) initial @xmath15 baryons , roughly corresponding to a change of @xmath156 in the value of @xmath97 or the size of @xmath15 .",
    "our results demonstrate that although the final number of @xmath15 produced in relativistic heavy ion collision is affected by hadronic interactions , it is nonetheless sensitive to the initial number of @xmath15 produced from the quark - gluon plasma",
    ".    this sensitivity would be even stronger if the width of @xmath15 is smaller than that used here , i.e. , @xmath157 mev . in this case , not only the decay probability of @xmath15 is reduced but also the hadronic cross sections become smaller as they are proportional to the square of the coupling constant @xmath158 , which is proportional to @xmath159 .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ mult](b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) for the abundance of @xmath15 using different @xmath15 widths of @xmath110 , @xmath160 , and @xmath128 mev , respectively",
    ". the smaller width of @xmath160 mev or less is actually more consistent with available @xmath161 and @xmath162 data arndt , haiden , nuss , cahn , azimov .",
    "with such a small @xmath15 width , the hadronic effects become insignificant , and the final @xmath15 abundance is essentially determined by production from the quark - gluon plasma .    on the other hand , the dependence of final @xmath15 number on its initial number from the quark - gluon plasma disappears only if hadronic cross sections are large .",
    "this happens when the latter is increased by about a factor of @xmath132 , corresponding to a @xmath15 width of @xmath163 mev .",
    "although such a large @xmath15 in - medium width is unlikely due to the weak coupling of @xmath15 to @xmath164 , the final @xmath15 number in this case is about @xmath165 and is comparable to that from the statistical model prediction of @xcite .",
    "in the kinetic equation , eq.([kinetic ] ) , we have not considered reactions involving more than three particles such as @xmath166 . taking its cross section the same as that for the reaction @xmath167 , eq.([kinetic ] )",
    "can be generalized to include both @xmath15 production and annihilation .",
    "we find that including this reaction affects the final @xmath15 abundance by less than @xmath168 . also , medium effects on the @xmath15 properties are not included . because of the weak @xmath15 coupling to @xmath164 and the small hadron density after hadronization of the quark - gluon plasma",
    ", these effects are not expected to be important .",
    "our result that the final number of exotic pentaquark @xmath0 produced in heavy ion collisions at rhic is sensitive to its initial number produced during the hadronization of the quark - gluon plasma is , however , based on the assumption that @xmath0 production from initial nucleon - nucleon collisions is not significant compared to that from the hot dense matter formed during the collisions .",
    "this is expected to be the case as string fragmentation to multiquark - anti - multiquark pairs is suppressed compared to fragmentation to diquark - anti - diquark pairs , from which normal three - quark baryons are produced in high energy proton - proton collisions .",
    "furthermore , both the quark flavor structure and mass of @xmath0 , which belongs to the antidecuplet of su(3 ) , are similar to those of the decuplet @xmath169 ( @xmath170 ) , whose abundance in central relativistic heavy ion collisions is known to be more than an order of magnitude larger than that expected from initial nucleon - nucleon interactions @xcite .    our study can be applied to production of anti-@xmath0 in heavy ion collisions at rhic . with the light antiquark",
    "to quark ratio of @xmath171 and antistrange to strange quark ratio of @xmath128 as a result of small quark baryon chemical potential @xmath36 mev , which gives an antiproton to proton ratio of @xmath172 at midrapidity consistent with experimental observations , the @xmath173 to @xmath0 ratio is expected to be @xmath174 .",
    "relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic thus also allows us to find the @xmath173 , which is not likely to be produced in either photo- or kaon - nucleus reactions .",
    "to summarize , we have used a kinetic model to study production of pentaquark @xmath0 baryon in central relativistic heavy ion collisions by including contributions both from the quark - gluon plasma via the parton coalescence model and from the hadronic matter through hadronic reactions between nucleons and pions or kaons .",
    "we find that a substantial number of @xmath0 are produced from the quark - gluon plasma . because of the expected narrow width",
    ", the @xmath0 interacts weakly in the hadronic matter . as a result ,",
    "the final number of @xmath0 is not much affected by interactions in the hadronic matter and is thus sensitive to the initial number of @xmath0 produced from the quark - gluon plasma .",
