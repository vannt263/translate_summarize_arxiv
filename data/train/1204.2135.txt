    "the almost everywhere finiteness of an exponential potential is substantially weaker than the well - known conjecture ( see @xcite ) , which states that for any finite measure @xmath1 , @xmath35 in @xcite , mateu , prat , and verdera proved ( [ strongtype ] ) in the range @xmath36 by using curvature methods , but it is not known whether this result should continue to hold if @xmath11 and @xmath37 . any such bound ( even theorem [ weaktype ] above )",
