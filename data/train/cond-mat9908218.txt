    "previously , we have numerically determined @xmath23 for the 3d anderson model from its density of states @xcite . using that result ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath24 , it is straightforward to determine the kinetic coefficients ( [ coeff ] ) and , consequently , the transport properties ( [ lreq ] ) .    in order to compare our results with experiments we have chosen the energy units to be in electron volts . for the same reason , we measure @xmath1 in units of @xmath25 . in this paper",
    "we only show the results obtained for disorder @xmath26 where w is the width of the box distribution of randomly chosen potential energies in the anderson model of localization .",
    "we have obtained similar results for other disorders not too close to the critical disorder @xmath27 @xcite and where there are no large fluctuations in the density of states . for @xmath26 ,",

    "the value of @xmath11 is set to 1.3 in agreement with numerical results @xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we illustrate similar scaling of @xmath2 . note that there is no pre - factor in the scaling form such as in @xmath1 since @xmath2 becomes independent of @xmath12 at the mit as @xmath46 .",
