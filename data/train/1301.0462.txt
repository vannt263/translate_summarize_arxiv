    "the star formation rates of high and intermediate redshift galaxies depend on the complex interplay between accretion and outflow . while infalling gas from the cosmic web provides fuel for starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the winds of young stars , supernovae , and active galactic nuclei cause feedback and dampen the intensity of the accretion ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the star formation history of a galaxy and its surrounding circum - galactic medium ( cgm ) are thus inextricably intertwined , and any model which seeks to reproduce the observed properties of these systems must take into account both of these processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "outflows are also common in lower - luminosity objects : the spectral analyses of @xcite and @xcite and more recently , @xcite clearly demonstrate that ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies at @xmath11 have strong galactic winds .",
    "however , while the evidence for outflows is compelling , there is as of yet no direct evidence for the cold gas infall that is predicted by galaxy formation models @xcite .",
    "detecting the circum - galactic material around high - redshift galaxies is a difficult proposition .",
    "@xcite was able to infer the existence of this component out to @xmath12  kpc by using angular pairs of unassociated @xmath11 star - forming galaxies and looking for ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath13 in absorption .",
    "however , a more direct approach is to search for circum - galactic material in emission .",
    "resonant scattering can cause the ly@xmath0 photons produced inside a galaxy to scatter hundreds or even thousands of times before escaping into intergalactic space .",
    "consequently , if a galaxy is surrounded by neutral hydrogen gas , that material is likely to be illuminated by ly@xmath0 . in fact , models by @xcite suggest that at @xmath14 , diffuse ly@xmath0 emission in the cgm may be observable several hundred kpc from the site of its creation .",
    "in addition to inflows and outflows , a clumpy and inhomogeneous ism may also create halo - like structures .",

    "* )    the recent observations by ( * ? ? ?",

    "by co - adding keck , hale , and subaru narrow - band images of 92 lbgs between @xmath15 , s11 claimed the detection of scattered ly@xmath0 from a diffuse halo that extends @xmath16  kpc from their mean composite galaxy .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this consistency led s11 to argue that ly@xmath0 halos are a generic feature of all high - redshift star - forming galaxies , and that these halos have self - similar exponential profiles .",
    "however , the galaxies targeted by s11 were all selected via the lyman - break technique , and are thus amongst the brightest and most massive galaxies in the high redshift universe . with stellar masses of @xmath17 , star formation rates ( sfrs ) of @xmath18  yr@xmath6 , and internal extinctions of @xmath19 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) these objects are in the extreme .",
    "most high-@xmath20-objects have much lower masses and star formation rates , and are not detectable via the lyman - break technique . to test the ubiquity of ly@xmath0 halos ,",

    "ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies ( laes ) may be a better population for this purpose .",
    "thousands of lae candidates have been detected over a very large range of redshifts using a variety of observational techniques , and their properties have been intensely studied .",
    "although laes can have ly@xmath0 luminosities similar to that of lyman - break galaxies , most have star formation rates ( sfr @xmath21  yr@xmath6 ) and stellar masses ( @xmath22 ) that are an order of magnitude less ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "finally , spectroscopy has shown that the contamination rate of photometrically - selected laes at @xmath25 is small , less than 2% @xcite .",

    "the s11 study focused on cluster lbgs at @xmath27 while m12 focused on laes at @xmath28 in a range of galaxy environments . in this paper , we investigate the extended ly@xmath0 halos of field laes at similar redshifts . in  2 , we define our samples using the @xmath8 observations of @xcite and @xcite , and the @xmath9 data of @xcite . in  3 , we describe our stacking technique and present the initial analysis of the ly@xmath0 profiles of our lae sub - samples .",

    "we show that stacks containing sources that have relatively low ly@xmath0 equivalent widths and/or bright continuum magnitudes are more likely to show extended ly@xmath0 emission than similar stacks with low continuum luminosities or high equivalent widths . in  6 , we compare our results to previous studies via a series of monte carlo simulations , and demonstrate that halos such as those found by s11 would have easily been detected in our survey . in  7 , we discuss possible explanations for our results , including the extended telescope point - spread - function , the limitations of sky subtraction , the intrinsic differences between galaxy populations , the effects of environment and orientation , and the possible evolution of ly@xmath0 halos between @xmath10 and @xmath31 .",
    "finally , in  8 , we summarize our results and discuss the possible ways of improving the constraints on ly@xmath0 halos with upcoming surveys and new ly@xmath0 radiative transfer models .    for this paper , we assume a @xmath32cdm cosmology with @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 . with these values , @xmath36  kpc at @xmath37 and @xmath38  kpc at @xmath39 .",

    "the statistically complete sample of laes in each data set was defined by finding all laes with fluxes greater than the 90% completeness level , where the completeness curve was determined from artificial star simulations .",

    "this lae catalog , hereafter called k - o3 , is 90% complete to @xmath43  ergs  s@xmath6 , and has considerable overlap with that of @xcite . however , because the k - o3 central wavelength is slightly redder than that of c - o3 , the dataset also contains 68 new objects in the redshift range @xmath44 .",
    "this k - o3 survey discovered 199 lae candidates ; 130 of these are in the statistically complete sample .",
    "the median seeing for this survey was @xmath45 .",
    "our third sample of laes examines a different redshift regime . by using a 50    fwhm filter",
    "centered at 3727   , @xcite were able to identify 250  lae candidates in the redshift range @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite further refined this sample , by improving the photometry , removing one probable agn , and using _ hubble space telescope _ morphological measurements to exclude 34 likely interlopers .",
    "this left a final sample consisting of 201 objects , of which 73 are brighter than a 90% completeness limit of @xmath47  ergs  s@xmath6 .",
    "we define this as the o2 lae sample .",
    "the median seeing for this survey was @xmath48 .    since all three surveys targeted a region of space with deep chandra data , most quasars and other active galactic nuclei have been eliminated from the samples based on their x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "similarly , because the ecdf - s has been subjected to deep near - uv ( 17002800 ) surveys by the _ galex _ and _ swift _ satellites @xcite , most foreground interlopers have already been identified .",
    "( for the redshifts under consideration , the rest - frame near - uv lies blueward of the lyman break . ) thus , our samples of laes should be relatively clean . of the 73 @xmath8  laes with spectroscopic confirmations , _ all",
    "_ have redshifts that place the galaxy between @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , of the 13 @xmath49 objects with spectroscopic redshifts @xcite , there are no foreground contaminants .",
    "finally , we should note that almost 300 laes in the e - cdfs ( 171 at @xmath8 and 108 at @xmath9 ) have been imaged in the rest - frame ultraviolet with _",
    "hubble space telescope s advanced camera for surveys_. an analysis of these data by @xcite has shown that in @xmath50 , laes in the redshift range @xmath51 are extremely compact , with median half - light radii less than @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath53 , the largest half - light radius recorded is @xmath54 and the largest half - light radius at @xmath49 is @xmath55 . in both cases , this is much smaller than the seeing of the ground - based images under consideration ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) , respectively .",
    "similar results have been found for other lae samples over a wide range of redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references within ) .",
    "consequently , if the ly@xmath0 emission emanating from these objects has the same spatial distribution as the uv light , the profiles of these objects should be consistent with those of the frames point spread functions .",
    "to search for extended ly@xmath0 emission , we began with the stacked mosaic  ii images obtained by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "first , a small @xmath58 ( 101 @xmath59 101 pixel ) region was extracted about the center of each lae . to avoid edge effects , any source close to the ccd boundaries",
    "was excluded at this step .",
    "this left us with 146 , 124 , and 69 sources in the statistically complete c - o3 , k - o3 , and o2 samples , and 241 , 179 , and 187 objects in the total samples of these surveys .",
    "next , to examine the behavior of ly@xmath0 halos in our highest mass objects , we used the broadband magnitudes of the musyc survey @xcite to define sub - samples of laes more luminous than @xmath60 . with this limit",
    ", these lae sub - samples have photometric and spectroscopic properties similar to those of the `` lae only '' sample of lbgs studied by s11 .",
    "these sub - samples , which we will refer to as `` uv bright , '' contain 28 , 19 , and 27 sources in the c - o3 , k - o3 , and o2 samples , respectively .",
    "finally , to examine whether equivalent width has any affect on the properties of ly@xmath0 halos , we ranked our laes by their ( photometrically - derived ) rest - frame equivalent widths , and created sub - samples of objects in the highest and lowest quartiles of the distribution .",
    "we refer to these sub - samples as `` high ew '' and `` low ew , '' and each contains 60 , 44 , and 50 objects in the c - o3 , k - o3 and o2 datasets , respectively . for the low ew sub - samples , the rest - frame equivalent widths range from 20    to 60   ; for the high - ew sub - set , ew@xmath61   , with most of the objects having rest - frame equivalent widths greater than 100   .",
    "we note that since the distribution of lae equivalent widths has ( at best ) a weak dependence on galaxy luminosity @xcite , samples chosen by equivalent width and uv - brightness are somewhat orthogonal .",
    "for example , in the c - o3 data , only @xmath62 of the low - equivalent width laes ( 16 out of 60 ) are members of the uv - bright sample ; for the k - o3 sample , this fraction is @xmath63 ( 16 out of 44 ) , and for o2 , the fraction is @xmath64 ( 22 out of 50 ) .",

    "we did this by scaling each object to a common narrow - band flux level and then combining the images , using the task within iraf , and adopting a ( @xmath65 ) sigma - clipping algorithm with a scheme which weighted each source by its total flux .",
    "this procedure is different than the stacking procedure of s11 , who used straight averages with masking for their stacks , and is slightly different than m12 , who used a median combination , but did not scale or weight their sources . to avoid any effects of interpolation , we used only integer pixel shifts for each stack ; this procedure has the effect of slightly increasing the radial surface brightness profile .",
    "the stacking procedure was used both on the original narrow - band images themselves , and on continuum - subtracted images , where the flux level at 5000    was defined using the @xmath66 and @xmath67 frames of the musyc survey @xcite . for the o2 data , the continuum flux at 3727    was derived from publicly available @xmath68 and @xmath66 frames taken with the wide field imager ( wfi ) of the eso 2.2 m telescope @xcite that were reprojected to match the musyc bvr image of the same field .",
    "these continuum subtracted images have the advantage of decreasing the contamination from nearby continuum sources , but come with the penalty of decreased signal - to - noise and possible mis - matches in the frames point - spread - functions ( psfs ) .",
    "finally , as a control on our experiments , we also analyzed a catalog of point sources initially found by @xcite on the musyc broad - band images .",
    "this catalog , which consists of objects with the colors of galactic k- and m - type stars , was further refined by @xcite using _ hst - wfc3 _ early release science images ( ers ; * ? ? ? * ) of the goods - s region .",

    "figure  [ fig : imagecomp ] compares the median - stacked image of the 146 @xmath39 laes in the statistically complete c - o3 sub - sample to that of the field s point sources . a careful examination of the figure reveals no compelling evidence for extended ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "the results for the other stacks are similar : there is no clear signature of extended ly@xmath0 emission in any of the lae sub - samples .",
    "table  2 quantifies this result by listing the fwhm of a two - dimensional gaussian fit to each image stack , as measured with the fitpsf task within iraf .",

    "this simple procedure does not fully account for the effects of centroiding errors : because the laes are much fainter than the comparison stars , the fwhm of their stacks are expected to be wider due to positional uncertainties . a more sophisticated analysis is therefore needed to find evidence of ly@xmath0 halos .",

    "however , as the histograms of figure  [ fig : hist ] illustrate , there is a significant amount of dispersion about the sky subtracted mean .",

    "we attribute this difference to the lower flux values associated with our narrow - band data : although the musyc images were taken with the same telescope and reduced using similar techniques , the increased count rate of the background sky depressed the relative importance of additive sky terms . by using the exposure times of each dataset ( given in the fifth column ) , the effective number of exposures ( given in the sixth column ) , and the typical mosaic  ii ccd gain of 2.55 e@xmath6 per adu , a representative poissonian error measured in adu can be calculated for each superbin as follows :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the median sky value given in units of adu  s@xmath6 per pixel , @xmath81 is the exposure time in seconds , @xmath82 is the adopted gain of the ccds , @xmath83 is the area of each superbin in pixels , ( we adopted @xmath77 pixels in this case ) and @xmath84 is the effective number of exposures .",

    "the local sky was within @xmath89 of the original sky value , and so the additional uncertainty introduced at this step was small ( on average a factor of two less than the large - scale flat - fielding error ) .",
    "this constant sky value was then subtracted from the radial profiles .",

    ".      could some instrumental or sampling issue be affecting our conclusions ?",
    "since our analysis is differential in nature , and we are directly comparing the laes to point sources using the exact same methods for stacking , averaging and fitting , it seems unlikely that we are being misled by subtle systematic errors .",
    "however , one possible difference between the two samples lies in their mean observed flux .",
    "the laes measured in figures  [ fig : co3prof ] through [ fig : o2prof ] are , on average , more than 100 times fainter than their point source counterparts , and hence have larger positional uncertainties .",
    "since the act of stacking relies on knowing the objects centroids , it is possible that in our co - addition procedure , we have artificially introduced a `` halo '' into our lae sample .    to quantify the potential strength of this effect we performed a series of monte - carlo experiments , each time adding 200 faint ( @xmath138 ) artificial point sources to the c - o3 frame , and stacking the results , while adding a random amount of positional uncertainty , @xmath139 , into the assumed @xmath140 and @xmath141 coordinate of each object",

    "obviously , the larger the value of @xmath139 , the larger the size of the apparent halo , so the amplitude of this effect depends strongly on the brightness distribution of the lae sample being studied .",
    "to determine this quantity , we adopted the lae flux distribution given in @xcite , and measured the uncertainty in position as a function of signal - to - noise using a series of artificial star experiments .",

    "the curves of figure  [ fig : centroid ] then suggest that errors in the lae centroiding can explain some ( @xmath62 of the flux ) , but not all , of the excesses we detect .    finally , it is unlikely that the discrepancy between our results and those of s11 and m12 comes from the small differences in the stacking procedures adopted by each study .",
    "our median combination and radial sigma - clipping algorithm has the advantage of being robust against unwanted flux from nearby continuum sources , and is less prone to contamination by unusual objects ( such as lyman - alpha blobs ) than other methods . yet",
    "the consistent scale lengths found by s11 across all their sub - samples make it unlikely that their result is driven by contamination , and , in any event , their masking procedure should have effectively removed any outlying flux .",

    "it is at least conceivable that on galaxy - sized scales , the uniformity of the sky background improves . to test this possibility",
    ", we performed a series of monte carlo simulations , using model lae halos of the form suggested by s11 .",
    "the goal of these simulations was to ensure that our imaging has sufficient signal - to - noise to detect extended lae halos , if they are present .",

    "we then randomly placed the artificial galaxies on their respective frames and stacked those objects brighter than the frame s 90% completeness limit .",
    "we performed eleven such simulations for the c - o3 and the o2 images , with halo - to - core ratios spaced evenly between zero and four .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ fig : montecarlo1 ] show the results of these simulations for halos of the type suggested by s11 .",
    "it is clear that at this halo - to - core ratio ( corresponding to @xmath150  ergs  @xmath5  s@xmath6  arcsec@xmath7 for the c - o3 stacks , and @xmath151  ergs  @xmath5  s@xmath6  arcsec@xmath7 for the o2 stacks ) , extended ly@xmath0 emission would have been easily detected , and their morphology would have been quite different from the observed profiles displayed in figures  [ fig : co3prof]-[fig : residuals ] .",
    "the panels also demonstrate that the surface brightness limits to which we can confidently trace ly@xmath0 emission are similar to those predicted by the large - scale flat - fielding error .",

    "we note that the stacked ly@xmath0 halo found by s11 for lbgs is relatively bright , as it contains @xmath154 times more flux than the galaxy s central core .",

    "most cosmological simulations  even those which include radiative transfer from ly@xmath0  do not include the effects of resonant scattering of photons from the inter- and circum - galactic medium . one exception is the work of @xcite , who calculated the expected spatial distribution of extended ly@xmath0 emission from laes at @xmath157 .",
    "these models predict that in the ly@xmath0 emission line , a high - redshift lae should have a central cusp , and a slowly declining envelope which extends outward from @xmath158  mpc to @xmath143  mpc ( in co - moving distance ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to directly compare our observational results at @xmath51 to the predictions of these models .",
    "the distribution of gas at @xmath157 is largely defined by infall , and is related to the virial radius of the galaxy ; both these parameters evolve rapidly in the gyr between @xmath157 and @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the @xcite models have a poorer spatial resolution than our data , making it difficult to compare except at the largest radii .",
    "these simulations also do not include the effects of dust , and , depending on how this component is distributed , its effect on the propagation of ly@xmath0 photons can be dramatic ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , the @xcite models do not take into account the internal structure and kinematics of the ism .",
    "thus , it is not possible to directly compare their model predictions with observational results .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed radiative transfer calculations for ly@xmath0 photons propagating through clumpy , dusty , large scale outflows . while these authors do predict the existence of extended ly@xmath0 halos , their initial models ( i  iii ) have halos that are more concentrated ( inner scale lengths of @xmath159 4 kpc ) than those observed by s11 , and are fainter by almost an order of magnitude ( @xmath160  ergs  @xmath5  s@xmath6  arcsec@xmath7 at a radius of @xmath161 5 ) . more complex models ( iv  v ) that include the deceleration of clumps are better matches to the halos observed by s11 , but still underpredict the flux by a factor of 23",
    "unfortunately , due to our observational limits , we would not be able to detect halos of these types ; only the two innermost points of their halos would be measurable in our data , with fluxes of @xmath162  ergs  @xmath5  s@xmath6  arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "several recent studies of ly@xmath0 emitters within a cosmological framework explicitly include explicit radiative transfer , and these could be applied to the problem of ly@xmath0 halos @xcite .    as detailed above , accurate surface photometry at low flux levels is difficult , and fraught with systematic errors",
    ". consequently , direct comparisons with other ly@xmath0 halo measurements is difficult and may ignore important systematic effects .",
    "using long - slit spectroscopy , @xcite found extended ly@xmath0 emission in roughly half of a sample of 27 laes in the redshift range @xmath163 .",
    "but this emission was weak : no brighter than @xmath164 erg  s@xmath6  @xmath5  arcsec@xmath7 at @xmath75 ( @xmath76  kpc ) and well below the level where systematic uncertainties dominate our error budget . yet a similar study by @xcite on 217 laes in the redshift range @xmath165 found no evidence for extended ly@xmath0 , as all their objects were found to be compact ( fwhm @xmath166 ) .",
    "m12 , by using the stacked images of several hundred field laes found on subaru frames , found halos at the level of @xmath167  ergs  s@xmath6  @xmath5  arcsec@xmath7 . for comparison ,",
    "the lbg halos of s11 and @xcite , which were measured in highly overdense regions of the universe , are almost an order of magnitude brighter .",
    "other attempts to image lae halos , both from the ground @xcite , and from space @xcite have placed only weak upper limits on the phenomenon , and generally probe very different spatial scales .",
    "recently , @xcite has stacked laes at z @xmath168 5.7 and 6.5 and has not found signs of extended lae halos .",
    "s11 hypothesize that extended ly@xmath0 halos are a `` generic property of high redshift star - forming galaxies '' , while m12 argue that the emission properties of ly@xmath0 halos depend on environment .",
    "neither of these studies took into account the systematics associated with the large radius point - spread - function or large - scale flat fielding , but neither are in direct conflict with our results .",
    "the median lae in our analysis is over a magnitude fainter than the lbgs studied by s11 , and our surface brightness limits , @xmath169 erg  s@xmath6 @xmath5 arcsec@xmath7 for @xmath170 and @xmath171 and @xmath4 erg  s@xmath6 @xmath5 arcsec@xmath7 for the two @xmath172 samples are brighter than the values quoted by m12 .",
    "thus , there are several ways to reconcile the three surveys .",
    "first , laes may have significantly fainter ly@xmath0 halos than lyman - break galaxies .",
    "in general , the star formation rates of laes are an order of magnitude smaller than those of lbgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is reasonable to hypothesize that the lower masses associated with laes also imply less circum - galactic material . these two factors may combine to produce ly@xmath0 halos whose surface brightness is highly sensitive to the luminosity of the underlying galaxy .",
    "this argument is somewhat mitigated by the fact that lyman - break galaxies have more internal extinction than their lae counterparts , but there are ways to distribute this dust so that the resonantly scattered ly@xmath0 photons can escape their surroundings @xcite .",
    "the fact that our best evidence for extended emission occurs on the c - o3 and k - o3 stacks of lbg - like objects and low - equivalent width sources argues in support of this interpretation .",
    "alternatively , the observability of ly@xmath0 halos may be due largely to galactic geometry .",
    "the probability of detecting ly@xmath0 emission from a galaxy depends on many factors , including viewing angle , dust content , gas dynamics , and intrinsic geometry . by definition ,",
    "laes are systems where the ly@xmath0 escape path falls along our line - of - sight ; in galaxies selected via the lyman - break technique , ly@xmath0 may leak out in other directions , thus facilitating the detection of a `` halo . ''",
    "s11 s data argue against this interpretation , since the halos surrounding lbgs with ly@xmath0 emission are no different from those where ly@xmath0 was only seen in absorption . however , the ly@xmath0 equivalent widths of typical laes are much greater than those associated with lbgs , so this selection effect may still play a role .",
    "recently , @xcite have claimed that ly@xmath0 emission from galaxies can have strong inclination effects , with laes with high equivalent widths being more likely to be found in face - on , rather than edge - on orientations .",
    "although there are many details still left to be resolved , it is also worth noting that the simulations of @xcite show a substantially weaker halo than s11 .    a third possibility concerns environment .",
    "m12 have argued that a galaxy s surroundings play an important role in the observability of ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "the lbgs studied by s11 are primarily located in overdense regions of the universe , including the well - known field ssa22 @xcite and two regions centered on hyper - luminous qsos ( hs1700 + 64 and hs1549 + 195 ) . in these `` proto - cluster '' environments",
    ", there is likely to be a large amount of circum - galactic material , which could scatter the ly@xmath0 photons which escape from galaxies .",
    "indeed , not only is ssa22 known for possessing large numbers of luminous ly@xmath0 blobs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but , according to m12 , its laes are similar in strength and profile to those found by s11 for the region s lbgs . in lower density regions ,",
    "m12 found the ly@xmath0 halos of laes to have steeper profiles with less total luminosity .",
    "the laes studied in this paper are all in the blank - field environment of the ecdf - s , which is equivalent to the @xmath121 sub - sample of m12 .",
    "if this is true , then the lack of halo emission around our galaxies should not be too surprising .",
    "finally , we note that our ly@xmath0 halo measurements at @xmath8 differ from those at @xmath9 : despite the @xmath173 gain in surface brightness , we see no evidence for extended ly@xmath0 halos in any of our lower - redshift sub - samples .",
    "one possible explanation for this difference lies in the uniformity of lae populations .",
    "a number of analyses have shown that laes at @xmath9 are , on average , slightly larger , dustier , and more heterogeneous than their @xmath8 counterparts @xcite .",
    "it is possible that this diversity at lower redshift might also lead to differences in halo properties .",
    "surface photometry at very low flux levels is treacherous , and extreme care must be used in modeling systematics such as the large - radius point - spread - function and the large - scale flat - fielding errors . by taking such factors into account , we were able to form stacked profiles of three sets of laes in the ly@xmath0 emission - line and to obtain robust estimates of their uncertainties . at @xmath8 ,",
    "we find mixed evidence for the presence of extended ly@xmath0 halos down to a surface brightness limit of @xmath174  ergs  @xmath5  s@xmath6  arcsec@xmath7 . at @xmath9 , where cosmological dimming is a factor of 3.2 less",
    ", we see no extended emission down to surface brightnesses of @xmath175  ergs  @xmath5  s@xmath6  arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "this is the first time the rigorous techniques of low - flux level surface photometry have been applied to the problem of galactic emission - line halos .    while our observations are not in direct conflict with those of @xcite and @xcite , they do place important constraints on the systematic behavior of ly@xmath0 halos and imply that such studies have higher uncertainties than originally thought .",
    "however , further progress on this problem will be difficult in the near - term . to succesfully image the emission - line halos around lae and lbg halos",
    ", one should obtain deep narrow - band exposures on telescopes with wide - field imagers that also have low scattered light profiles and very stable flat - fields .",
    "this means paying close attention to the details of baffling and flat - fielding ( i.e. , taking the dark - sky flat flat - fields at the same hour angle as the observations ) and using closed - tube telescopes with cameras designed to minimize the total number of internal reflections .",
    "our observations , as well as those of s11 and m12 , were performed with open - tube telescopes and wide - field imagers that contained multi - component optical corrector systems .",
    "as this is the norm for large wide - field imaging telescopes , it will be difficult to extend imaging surveys much below the surface brightness limits achieved here , though observations of additional fields will allow for better determination of systematic effects and allow us to better probe the effects of galactic environment on lae halos .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to study the emission - line halos of high - redshift galaxies with spectroscopy . starting in 2014",
    ", the integral - field units of the hobby - eberly telescope dark energy experiment ( hetdex ) will obtain two - dimensional spectra for @xmath176 ly@xmath0 emitters in the redshift range @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "these data , which will have @xmath178 spatial resolution and @xmath179    spectral resolution , should allow us to trace circum - galactic ly@xmath0 emission to levels far below what is currently possible and to determine the properties of these systems as a function of luminosity , equivalent width , dust content , redshift , and environment , and thus illuminate material in the high - redshift universe s cosmic web .",
