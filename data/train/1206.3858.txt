    "the topdown hexagonal clusters show three cycles between hexagonal numbers , and turn out to be better than a spiral hexagonal cluster for half the time .",
    "this shape becomes expensive when there is a half - row of hexagons along one side of the cluster , an observation that also applies to the corner hexagonal clusters . in this case , removing a small number of bubbles from all six corners of the outer shell of a hexagonal cluster is good for @xmath0 slightly below a hexagonal number , but this method becomes more expensive as the number removed increases because of the number of partial lines of hexagons in the outer shell .",

    "for @xmath0 just below a hexagonal number , the corner hexagonal clusters and the hybrid cluster are slightly different , although the methods described above should give exactly the same answer .",
