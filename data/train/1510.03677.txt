    "the 2015 outburst of v404 cyg will probably remain a unique event in astrophysical history . identified as a nova in 1938 , when only optical observations were available , v404 cyg came back to the forefront in 1989 when another nova episode was observed simultaneously in optical and in the soft x - rays and hard x - rays domains by the ginga satellite ( from where its second name comes gs2023 + 338 , @xcite ) and the roentgen instruments onboard the kvant module @xcite .",
    "it presented huge variability , and reached several crab flux levels , in soft x - rays as well as in hard x - rays , becoming the brightest source ever observed in these energy ranges .",
    "the parameters have been determined , with the system located at 2.39 @xmath4 0.14 kpc @xcite and containing a @xmath0 10 @xmath5 black hole , with an orbital period around 6.5 days @xcite .",
    "the 2015 episode started with similar burst - like activity that was first detected by swift / bat @xcite and fermi / gbm @xcite , and soon after was observed at all wavelengths from radio @xcite to hard x - rays and reached exceptional levels of luminosity , exceeding all expectations ( up to 50 crab in hard x - rays , @xcite ) .    among the global monitoring of the source , _ integral _ , with its two main instruments spi and ibis , played a major role in the hard x - ray / soft @xmath6-ray studies",
    "we analyzed the first public observation from 2015 june 17 to june 20 ( revolution 1554 ) for a total useful duration of 150 ks .",
    "the spi analysis is based on consolidated data and algorithms developed at irap .",
    "considering the source exceptional flux level and variability , it is worth mentioning that the spi data are not affected by pile - up or tm saturation .",
    "only a limited number of data packets are missing corresponding to a few seconds of data , with an energy independent effect .",
    "the ibis data for this observation are near real - time data processed using the latest release of the _ integral _ offline scientific analysis ( osa version 10.1 ) .",
    "the ibis and spi results have been compared , and show that the source fluxes are in good agreement , even if , at high flux levels , ibis / isgri spectra appear systematically harder than the spi ones ( see analysis by @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this is under investigation , and probably related to a combination of source variability and telemetry saturation .",
    "+ the description of the instruments and performance can be found in @xcite and @xcite for spi , and @xcite for ibis .",
    "the source variability at all wavelengths and on all timescales is striking .",
    "however , the emission above @xmath0 200 kev contains key information about the population(s ) present and energy transfer but requires longer integration time .",
    "the present analysis is based on the science window ( scw ) timescale , a time interval lasting approximatively 3.4 ks , and corresponding to a stable pointing direction .",
    "[ fig : cl.1swc ] displays the source evolution over 4 broad bands covering the 20 - 650 kev domain , and demonstrates that , on this @xmath0 hour timescale , the source variability is significant up to @xmath0 500 kev , and appears energy dependent .    in order to quantify the spectral evolution , the observed emission",
    "is described with a common model , both physically reasonable and as simple as possible .",
    "an averaged spectrum has been built and fitted with the xspec v12.8.2 tools @xcite .",
    "starting from a comptonization model , we note the emergence of a high energy component around 100 kev .",
    "this component is reminiscent of the hard tail observed in several x - ray binary systems , transient sources ( e. g. nova persei = groj0422 + 32 , @xcite ) or persistent sources ( e. g. cyg x-1 ) . continuing the analogy with the well - studied source cyg x-1",
    ", we add to our model the same second component ( cutoff powerlaw ) used to account for the high energy tail in the hard state .",
    "this simple model failed to take into account the actual curvature in the low energy part , and we have tested a scenario with a reflecting and/or absorbing medium .",
    "the required values imply very specific geometry or a strong absorption of photons at lower energy . as a second option",
    ", we relaxed the constraint on the temperature of seed photons ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "surprisingly , a temperature around 6 - 7 kev perfectly reproduces the data .",
    "+ finally , we have chosen to describe the spectral emission of v404 cyg with the following model : a comptonization component ( comptt ) , with two free parameters ( kt and @xmath8 , temperature and optical depth of the comptonizing electron population , with @xmath7 fixed to 6.5 or 7 kev , see table [ tab : fitindiv ] ) and a cutoff power law , to account for the high energy part .",
    "we fix its photon index to 1.6 and start with a cutoff energy default value of 300 kev . + from fig . [",
    "fig : cl.1swc ] , a few periods have ben chosen to illustrate the spectral evolution of v404 cyg : + ( 1)first small peak ( june 18 , 12:11 - 14:07 ut ; 6 ks ) + ( 2)off - flare state ( june 18 , 19:02-june 19 , 03:29 ut ; 25 ks ) + ( 3)plateau ( june 19 , 03:31 - 07:25 ut ; 11.5 ks ) + ( 4)first maximum peak ( june 19 , 07:26 - 08:23 ut ; 3 ks ) + ( 5)second maximum peak ( june 19 , 13:19 - 14:15 ut ; 3 ks ) + the corresponding spectra are compared in fig.[fig:6spectres ] .",
    "tab.[tab : fitindiv ] gives the best fit parameter values when they are fit individually , and the parameters obtained for the averaged spectrum for comparison .",
    "for the low flux periods ( [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ) , the cutoff powerlaw component is not required , probably due to the low signal to noise ratio . note that these periods are described by a hotter and thiner comptonizing medium , while the temperature decreases and the optical depth increases when the source s flux is high .    in a second step , to overcome the error bars and degeneracy between kt and @xmath8 , we have also fit all the spectra together , aiming to extract more information with a minimal number of free parameters .",
    "we thus started our fitting procedure by imposing the same parameter values ( except normalizations ) to all considered spectra , and freed successively , one by one , those required to improve significantly the global @xmath9 .",
    "finally ( see table[tab : fitindiv ] ) , a global reasonable description is obtained with @xmath7 fixed to 7.0 kev and photon index to 1.6 , while a common @xmath8 converges toward a value of 1.55 .",
    "the cutoff energy is fixed to 300 kev for all spectra but the averaged one , which includes a lot of spectral variability , limiting its scientific contents .",
    "the most striking result is that , in such a scheme , the temperature is stable ( between 25 and 28 kev ) , except during the period where the source seems to be less active ( period [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the spectral emission at that time is harder , and this translates into a comptonizing temperature of 40 - 50 kev .",
    "it is worth noting that the high energy component is formally required in the high flux level spectra , and that introducing it in the moderate flux peak ( period [ 1 ] ) affects the best fit parameters in such a way that they become compatible with those obtained during the high flux periods ( see tab.[tab : fitindiv ] ) .",
    "notice also that at shorter timescales , the spectral shape evolution can be described with the same scheme . in fig.[fig:6spectres ] ,",
    "spectrum [ 6 ] corresponds to the maximum in a 100 s time bin .",
    "when this short specrum is compared to the longer term spectra , the global shapes appear similar , indicating that low and high energy components evolve more or less in the same way at all time scales .",
    "this information , together with correlations at other wavelengths , will be crucial to draw a more complete picture of the emitting regions and their intrinsic evolution .",
    "+ as a supplementary study , we have considered a 4.5 kev wide channel centered at 511 kev in order to search for an annihilation emission .",
    "the observed flux remains below 2 @xmath10 for each of the individual scws , leading to an upper limit of 1 - 2 @xmath11 .",
    "when considering the whole revolution ( 150 ks ) , we obtain a 2  @xmath10 upper limit of 2  @xmath12 .",
    "compared to the values given for other black hole binaries in teegarden and watanabe ( 2006 ) , these upper limits can provide further constraints for models since they give limits in the case of very high luminosity , and on short timescales .",
    "we are reporting here results obtained in the hard x - ray domain ( 20 to @xmath0 650 kev ) from the first revolution dedicated to v404 cyg by the integral mission . while the extreme variability makes it difficult to get instantaneous values of the parameters of emitting region(s )",
    ", we studied the source evolution during the flaring activity to estimate values representative of the global emission .",
    "we have shown that the observed emission can be described with two components .",
    "several scenarios are able to account for the data , but we had to choose one to present the results in a way as instructive as possible . in this work , the first component is identified with a thermal comptonization emission .",
    "the low energy curvature has required a specific attention .",
    "three parameters can help to describe it properly : an absorbing factor , @xmath13 , a reflection factor , r , or the temperature of the seed photons , @xmath7 .",
    "however , for each of them , the fit procedure converges toward unusual values : @xmath13 of the order of a few @xmath14 , in contradiction with the soft x - rays observations @xcite , r @xmath0 5 , which would imply a peculiar geometry or @xmath15 7 @xmath16 kev .",
    "this may be linked to the exceptional source luminosity or reflect the presence of another component at low energy or else another origin of the seed photons .",
    "the unceasing variability of the comptonizing population parameters , in space and/or in time , may also be responsible for the observed shape , since any gradient in kt or @xmath8 modifies the resulting emission .",
    "we give in this paper the results obtained with @xmath7 = 7 kev .",
    "the reflection component is not included since it would add an additional free parameter which can not be constrained .",
    "we have checked that to add a reflection factor ( fixed to 1 ) only slightly modifies the best fit parameter values and does not affect the scientific conclusions . + for the second component , we have chosen a cutoff power law with a photon index of 1.6 and a cutoff energy of 300 kev , to test a scenario similar to that observed in cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "+ with the above hypothesis , we obtain a good description of the data and identify two states .",
    "a ) a quiet phase , when the source flux remains relatively low ( 300 mcrab ) and the spectrum hard , with a comptonization temperature @xmath0  40 kev .",
    "b ) an `` active '' phase , when the source flares , with huge variability and impressive amplitude changes , and a plasma temperature around 25 kev .",
    "the second component is not required during the quiet phase and varies significantly during the active phase .",
    "both components contribute to the global flux intensity , even if their variations are not strictly correlated , leading to an evolving spectral shape .",
    "this suggests that they are due to two different but probably linked mechanisms .",
    "+ the similarity between v404 cyg and cyg x-1 spectral shapes in the high energy domain suggests that the second component could be related to a jet contribution extending from radio up to hard x - rays .",
    "the radio flaring activity reported during the outburst @xcite could be used to test this hypothesis .",
    "polarization measurements could give a decisive answer .",
    "however , if the extreme variability of the source also affects the jet component , it could cancel any coherent polarization signal .",
    "+ in addition , such an exceptional event requires a careful study of the 500 kev energy domain . in the presented observations",
    ", we did not detect any narrow feature at 511 kev , on the timescales of hours or days .",
    "this means that if 511 kev photons are produced , the flux does not exceed @xmath2  ( 2  @xmath10 ) for a width of 4.5 kev and a total duration of 150 ks .",
    "the large amount of high statistics data from v404 cyg opens a large domain of new studies : spectral variability over the minute timescale , evolution of the high energy component , timing studies in the hard x - rays / soft gamma - ray domains , etc .",
    "this means that what we will learn from this peculiar event will give us a new view of this family of objects .",
    "the analysis of the v404 cyg 2015 outburst is still in its early stages .",
    "the multiwavelength campaign triggered by the first observations ensures a huge amount of data .",
    "the hard x - ray domain enlightens the innermost regions of the source and reveals the behavior of the most energetic particles at work during the flaring activity .",
    "the source emission is satisfactorily described by a hot ( 40 - 50 kev ) comptonized component , with no need for a second component ( quiet state ) , or by a cooler comptonizing plasma ( 25 - 30 kev ) plus a second component , possibly related to jet synchrotron emission , which appears above the thermal cutoff ( active state ) .",
    "+ a search for a narrow emission at 511 kev remained unsuccessful , but deeper studies are required to investigate the presence of any broad and/or shifted feature potentially related to the annihilation process . + _ integral _ has observed this source for 4 weeks .",
    "this will allow the polarization to be investigated .",
    "also , information coming from all wavelengths will have to be correlated to reveal a more complete picture of the source and understand the physics at work . in conclusion ,",
    "v404 cyg offers us , with this exceptional outburst , a unique opportunity to make a significant breakthrough in both the x - ray transient phenomenon and x - ray binary sytems .",
    "+ _ note : results on the two next revolutions are reported in @xcite , with a different spectral description .",
    "all the spi spectra presented in our paper are made available in a fits format on the site given in footnote 2 , in order to allow anybody to test different models . _",
    "the _ integral _ spi project has been completed under the responsibility and leadership of cnes .",
