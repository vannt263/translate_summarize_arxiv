    "even if the planck satellite  @xcite confirmed that about 85 % of the total amount of the matter is dark , the community still lacks a clear evidence of its nature through a direct or indirect signal .",
    "indeed , the last results of xenon100  @xcite , lux  @xcite and fermi observation of the galactic center  @xcite or dwarf galaxies  @xcite impose very strong constraints on the mass of a weakly interacting massive particle , ( if one excludes the 3@xmath1 galactic center excess consistent with the range of dark matter identified in the fermi - lat data  @xcite ) , questioning the wimp paradigm .",
    "little is known about the mass and coupling of dark matter , and even the `` wimp miracle '' is questionable  @xcite if one introduces a hidden mediator sector `` @xmath2 '' , with its mass @xmath3 and coupling @xmath4 respecting @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the wimp mass and @xmath7 is the electroweak gauge coupling constant .",

    ".    a possible smoking gun signature of the interaction of dark matter in our galaxy or in larger structure would be the observation of a monochromatic signal ( photon , neutrino or positron ) generated by the annihilation or the decay of the candidate . in 2012 , several studies claimed for the observation of a @xmath8 monochromatic photon - line produced near the center of our milky way  @xcite .",
    "phenomenological models describing the possibility of generating such a line then appeared in the literature  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the presence of a seemingly unexplained x - ray line observed by the xmm - newton observatory in galaxies and galaxy clusters @xcite increased the interest for annihilating  @xcite or decaying  @xcite light dark matter scenarios .",
    "excited dark matter  @xcite or axion - like candidates  @xcite were also proposed as alternative interpretations .",
    "on the other hand , if the x - ray line excess discussed above is interpreted as a dark matter signal , a same excess should be observed from the other galaxies such as the milky way , m31 and dwarf spheroidal galaxies in addition to the perseus and centaurus clusters .",
    "however such a signal has not yet been observed in milky way  @xcite , m31  @xcite , stacked galaxies  @xcite and stacked dwarf galaxies  @xcite . for completeness , keeping open all possible interpretation of the 3.5 kev line signal , we will present the result of both analysis ( signal or constraint ) in every scenarios we studied in this work .    in parallel",
    ", recently the authors of  @xcite claimed that the observations of one ( particularly well constrained ) galaxy in the cluster abell 3827 revealed a surprising @xmath9 kpc offset between its dark matter and stars .",
    "they affirm that such an offset is consistent with theoretical predictions from the models of self - interacting dark matter , implying a lower bound of the self - interacting cross section divided by the dark matter mass @xmath10 . in the meantime ,",
    "another group  @xcite with a different kinematical analysis for the very same galaxy obtained the value @xmath11 in the case of contact interaction corresponding to the exchange of a massive mediator in opposition to long range interaction which can arise for example from a massless mediator  @xcite .",
    "entering into the debate of the exact value deduced from the observations is far beyond the scope of our work .",
    "however , one has to admit that any evidence for dark matter self - interaction would have strong implications for particle physics , as it would severely constrain or even rule out popular candidates such as supersymmetric neutralino / gravitino , axions , or any higgs , @xmath12 , @xmath13 portal wimp  like candidates .",
    "the main reason is that , within the sensitivity of present measurements , the observation of a self - interaction would imply the ratio @xmath14 , which is much larger than any typical wimp values @xmath15 .    in this work ,",
    "we show that it is possible , in a minimal framework , to relate naturally the ( smoking gun ) monochromatic signal generated by the annihilation of a pseudo - scalar particle to its self - interaction process . as a consequence , any signal or constraint derived by the ( non-)observation of self - annihilation ( coming for instance from the `` bullet cluster '' ( 1e 0657 - 56 ) which is typically of the order of @xmath16  @xcite )",
    "induces direct limits on the monochromatic signature .",
    "we begin our study by combining the constraints from different experimental analyses , before applying our results to the recent 3.5 kev line claims @xcite .",
    "we show that the observation of such a signal implies naturally a relatively strong self - interacting process compatible with the limits on @xmath17 obtained recently @xcite .",
    "we would like to insist that beyond the 3.5 kev signal consideration ( one does not need to agree with the dark matter interpretation of the line or the self - interacting dark matter observations ) the aim of our work is more general .",
    "we show the correlation which exists between an indirect detection signal and a self - interacting process once one builds an explicit microscopic model , with a dynamical symmetry breaking , which are not necessary present if one takes a pure effective approach .    the paper is organized as follows . after a short description of the model under consideration in section",
    "ii , we compute and analyze the self - interaction process combined with the monochromatic constraints and signal extracted from a set of different experimental collaborations in section iii . section iv is devoted to the discussion and signatures in terms of indirect and direct detection prospects in more general cases .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section v , while appendix contains alternative scenarios with a fermionic dark matter .",
    "in this section , we describe the model of a pseudo - scalar dark matter .",
    "the reader interested in alternative scenarios can find in appendix the formulae in the case of a fermionic dark matter .",
    "the model was originally built with success to interpret the recent monochromatic signal observed in different clusters of galaxies  @xcite . in this model , a scalar , or pseudo - scalar particle",
    "is _ by definition _ a self - interacting particle .",
    "the higgs boson , unique observed spin 0 particle until now , is a self - interacting particle through its quartic coupling .",
    "several other self - interacting candidates have been proposed in the literature , but usually these were spin 1/2 particles . however , in this case , it becomes necessary to invoke specific processes ( like sommerfeld enhancement , or strong interaction ) to compensate the dimensionality of the 4-fermion couplings . in the case of a scalar or pseudo - scalar dark matter",
    "@xmath18 , the self interaction term @xmath19 is always allowed by a global @xmath20 invariance and induces then necessarily self - interacting processes . moreover , in the framework of spontaneous symmetry breaking , a strong correlation exists between the vacuum expectation value ( @xmath21 ) of @xmath18 , its mass and the quartic coupling @xmath22 , rendering the construction very predictive .",
    "the general renormalizable potential for a scalar complex field @xmath23    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the bare mass of @xmath26 and @xmath22 is the quartic coupling of @xmath26 .    after a spontaneous breaking of the symmetry , it is straightforward to re - express the potential as a function of the fundamental components of @xmath27 with @xmath28 . absorbing the unphysical constants , we obtain    @xmath29    with the scalar mass @xmath30 .",
    "it is important to notice that if our @xmath20 symmetry was exact ( prior to develop a @xmath21 ) , the pseudo - scalar dark matter mass @xmath31 would remain massless to all orders in perturbation theory . in what follows",
    ", we will assume that the @xmath20 symmetry is broken by non - perturbative effects down to a discrete @xmath32 symmetry .",
    "it is actually standard in string theory that all symmetries are gauged symmetries in the uv .",
    "is generated by the mechanism .",
    "] thus a non - zero dark matter mass @xmath31 being much lighter than @xmath33 is expected .",
    "+      in our model , we have four diagrams contributing to the self - interacting cross section as depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : aa ] .",
    "once the scalar part of @xmath26 develops a @xmath21 it becomes possible to re - express the total cross section as    @xmath34    it is interesting to note that the cross section is of the form @xmath35 and then null for @xmath36 , whereas if one takes into account only the quartic vertex @xmath37 , it should naively be proportional to @xmath38 and could potentially diverge . the mechanism canceling the divergences",
    "is in fact similar to the higgs contribution occurring in the @xmath39 scattering in the standard model .",
    "this can be easily understood as @xmath31 can be considered as the pseudo - goldstone boson generated by the breaking of the global @xmath20 symmetry .",
    "this fundamental feature _ would not _ have been observed in the framework of an effective approach if one introduces a dimensional coupling of the form @xmath40 , @xmath41 being a free mass parameter .",
    "it is thus the dynamical structure of the construction which defines precisely its self  coupling constants .",
    "another interesting point is that for a mev scale mediator @xmath42 , one does not need to invoke very large values of @xmath22 to obtain self - interacting cross section compatible with recent analysis .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath43 kev and @xmath44 mev , one obtains @xmath45 which is in the order of the measured limit ( @xmath46 ) for a reasonable value of @xmath47 , much below the perturbativity limit , without invoking velocity enhancement .      concerning the coupling to the photons",
    ", we consider the coupling which can be written as    @xmath48    with @xmath49 being the electromagnetic field strength .",
    "the scale @xmath50 can be interpreted in a uv completion since it can be determined by a set of new heavy charged particles running in triangular loops .",
    "the mass scale of new charged particles is assumed to be heavier than @xmath51 gev to respect the lep constraint , depending on the number of charged particles .",
    "several experiments restrict @xmath50 from the horizontal branch ( hb ) stars processes  @xcite to the lep  @xcite or beam dump experiment constraints  @xcite .",
    "we will review them in detail in the next section , but roughly speaking , the coupling of a scalar to photons is extremely suppressed ( @xmath52 ) for @xmath53 kev , largely due to the hb limits . for @xmath54 kev",
    ", a window opens , allowing values of @xmath50 as low as 10 gev . in a uv complete model",
    ", such low values of @xmath50 can be understood if the number of fermions running in the loop is relatively important ( of the order of 10 ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath55 coupling generates naturally the production of monochromatic photons from the s - channel annihilation of the dark matter candidate @xmath56 as depicted in the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : gg ] .",
    "the annihilation cross section for @xmath57 is given by  @xcite    @xmath58    for @xmath59 , the above cross sections eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmaaa ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmav_gg ] ) can be simplified to be @xmath60    by eliminating @xmath22 in both expressions , it becomes possible for each energy @xmath61 being equivalent to the dark matter mass @xmath31 since dark matter is almost at rest , to express @xmath62 _ uniquely _ as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath63 ,    @xmath64    this is one of the main results of our work .",
    "it is indeed surprising that asking for a reasonable value for the self - interacting cross section of the order of @xmath65 , one obtains naturally the annihilation cross section of the order of @xmath66 for a monochromatic kev signal , which corresponds exactly to the magnitude of the signals observed by xmm newton  @xcite in the perseus cluster .",
    "if one adds a coupling to the neutrino sector as was shown in @xcite . ] on the other hand , strong limits obtained from the non - observation of a monochromatic line by observatories such as heao-1 integral , comptel , egret and fermi restrict severely the lower bound on the scale @xmath50 in the rest of the parameter space , as we will analyse in the following section .      building",
    "a complete ultraviolet model is far beyond the scope of this work , but we can give some hints for further developments .",
    "indeed , even if the lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) breaks @xmath67 the @xmath20 symmetry , we can have a look to higher dimensional operators which can generate such a term after the breaking of the @xmath20 symmetry .",
    "the simplest dimension @xmath68 operator can be written as @xmath69 with @xmath70 being a different cut - off scale from @xmath50 introduced in eq .",

    "the effective model built from the lagrangian generates the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim6 ] ) .",
    "this contact interaction contributes also to the annihilation cross section @xmath57 . including this new contribution ,",
    "the total cross - section is then given by @xmath73 however , in the rest of our work we will continue to consider the dimension-5 coupling approach @xmath74 because a complete dimension-6 operator analysis would require a much more careful study of all the possible operators involved in the processes .",
    "the status of the ( non-)observation of self - interacting dark matter has become somewhat quite confusing recently , due to the release of ( seemingly ) contradictory results .",
    "indeed , some authors of ref .  @xcite using the new hubble space telescope imaging , claimed to have observed that the dark matter halo of at least one of the central galaxies belonging to the cluster abell 3827 is spatially offset from its stars .",
    "the offset , of the order of 1.62 kpc could be interpreted as an evidence of self - interacting dark matter with a ratio of cross section over mass of @xmath75 .",
    "@xcite . ] in the meantime , using a different kinematical approach than  @xcite , the authors of  @xcite obtained a value of @xmath76 , resulting in tension with the upper bounds set by other astrophysical objects such as the `` bullet cluster '' ( 1e 0657 - 56 ) which are typically of the order of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the two analyses came from some approximations concerning the evolution time , and the gravitational back - reaction of the halo on its stars during the separation process due the drag forces .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have already addressed this issue some time ago in  @xcite .",
    "they clearly distinguished the contact interaction or @xmath77 interaction ( our case ) from the long - range force ( involving sommerfeld enhancement ) or @xmath78 self - interactions through the position of the peak of the dark matter distribution compared to the position of the stars / galaxies after the interaction .    in this work",
    ", we decided to take the two values proposed by the two groups as benchmark points , to show the correlation between an indirect signal ( monochromatic photon in our case ) and the self - interaction , once one has built an explicit microscopic model .",
    "some recent phenomenological constructions explaining these observations can be found in  @xcite for a model with a gauged @xmath79 discrete symmetry ; a very nice interpretation in the framework of a higgs portal ( freeze - in mechanism ) in  @xcite whereas other authors introduced a dark photon sector  @xcite or a strong interacting sector  @xcite .      when a light ( pseudo-)scalar interacts with photons , the helium burning period of hb stars is shortened due to non - standard energy loss since the light ( pseudo- ) scalar is produced in the stellar interior by photons within thermal distribution  @xcite .",
    "this effect gives a strong constraint on the coupling between the light ( pseudo-)scalar and photons for the ( pseudo-)scalar mass lighter than @xmath80 .",
    "the detailed analysis has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite and we used their result in our study . coupling in the scalar potential could also affect the hb bound since a pair of dark matter can be generated from the off - shell produced scalar @xmath42 .",
    "however , this off - shell contribution is expected to be much smaller than the dominant primakoff effect . ]",
    "the interaction between the ( pseudo-)scalar and photons is also constrained by mono - photon search at leptonic collider experiments .",
    "its signature is @xmath81 .",
    "the collider bound has been compiled in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking into account the asp ( anomalous single photon ) experiment  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the improved lep ( large electron - positron collider ) limits based on the data of aleph , opal , l3 and delphi have been published in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the computation of the relic abundance of dark matter in our framework has already been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "we will not repeat the analysis in this work , but we recall its main point .",
    "adding interactions to the neutrino sector through @xmath42 as a mediator can fulfill perfectly the relic abundance of dark matter measured by planck while in the meantime generating naturally a massive neutrino sector respecting the recent cosmological bounds on neutrino masses ( @xmath82 ev , see @xcite for a review on the subject ) .",
    "the presence of a dark bath between the neutrino and dark matter allows it in the parameter range of our work .",
    "however , keeping in mind this elegant possibility , our aim is to study the properties of self - interacting dark matter at the present time and the correlation between different observations in present large scale structures , independently on hypothesis concerning the thermal history generating the correct amount of dark matter abundance .",

    "it is nevertheless interesting to apply our analysis in this concrete example to check if such a signal can be compatible with the limits derived from the recent self - interaction measurements .",
    "the flux generated by the annihilation of dark matter in the perseus cluster for instance can be computed from the luminosity of the cluster @xmath83  @xcite    @xmath84    with the perseus radius @xmath85 , the number density of dark matter @xmath86 , the dark matter profile @xmath87 and the thermally averaged cross section @xmath88 . at a first approximation",

    "one can then deduce the flux @xmath95 that one should observe on earth    @xmath96    according to the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can identify the monochromatic signal arising from andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) or perseus cluster with the flux @xmath97 at 3.56 kev including the cluster core . and",

    "we will parametrize our uncertainty from the dark matter distribution in the source by the classical `` astrophysical '' parameter @xmath99 with @xmath100 , @xmath83 being the effective luminosity for a steeper profile than the mean one we considered above .",
    "finally , extending the analysis by taking into account also other observations like m31 , we will impose in our analysis a conservative annihilation cross section which is required to reproduce the x - ray line estimated as    @xmath101",

    "for completeness , here we present the main alternatives to the pseudo - scalar dark matter candidate , in the same framework .",
    "the self - interacting cross section of majorana dark matter is computed from the yukawa interaction .",
    "although there are three contributions to the amplitude coming from @xmath42 , @xmath135 and @xmath136-channels , the @xmath42-channel is velocity suppressed and the other @xmath135 and @xmath136-channels give a dominant contribution .",
    "thus the self - interacting cross section is given by            as one can see from the formula , this cross section is suppressed by the dark matter relative velocity @xmath141 .",
    "thus it would be difficult to give a connection between the self - interacting dark matter and the x - ray monochromatic line unless an enhancement mechanism like sommerfeld is taken into account .          with the coupling @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the dual tensor of @xmath145 .",
    "there are @xmath42 , @xmath135 and @xmath136-channels contributing to the amplitude for the self - interacting cross section of dark matter .",
    "the amplitudes coming from the @xmath135 and @xmath136-channels are velocity - suppressed and negligible . as a result , the dark matter self - interacting cross section is given by              where @xmath149 is assumed .",
    "one can see that @xmath50 is one order of magnitude smaller than the scalar dark matter case because of the additional suppression due to the ratio of the squared mass @xmath150 . however , this candidate is also a viable one , and potentially explain the monochromatic signal and the self - interacting dark matter in a single framework .",
