    "the enigmatic of?p stars are identified by a number of peculiar and outstanding observational properties .",
    "the classification was first introduced by walborn ( 1972 ) according to the presence of c  iii @xmath0 emission with a strength comparable to the neighbouring n  iii lines .",
    "well - studied of?p stars are now known to exhibit recurrent , and apparently periodic , spectral variations ( in balmer , he  i , c  iii and si  iii lines ) with periods ranging from days to decades , strong c  iii @xmath0 in emission , narrow p cygni or emission components in the balmer lines and he  i lines , and uv wind lines weaker than those of typical of supergiants ( see naz et al . 2010 and references therein )",
    ".    only 5 galactic of?p stars are known ( walborn et al . 2010 ) : hd 108 , hd 148937 , hd 191612 , ngc 1624 - 2 and cpd@xmath1 .",
    "three of these stars - hd 108 , hd 148937 and hd 191612 - have been studied in detail . in recent years , hd 191612 was carefully examined for the presence of magnetic fields ( donati et al .",
    "2006 ) , and was clearly detected .",
    "recent observations , obtained chiefly within the context of the magnetism in massive stars ( mimes ) project ( martins et al .",
    "2010 ; wade et al .",
    ", in prep ) have furthermore detected magnetic fields in hd 108 and hd 148937 , thereby confirming the view of of?p stars as a class of slowly rotating , magnetic massive stars .",
    "hd 191612 was the first of?p star in which a magnetic field was detected ( donati et al .",
    "subsequent mimes observations with espadons@cfht ( wade et al .",
    ", in prep ) confirm the existence of the field , and demonstrate the sinusoidal variability of the longitudinal field with the h@xmath2 and photometric period of 537.6 d. as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the longitudinal field , h@xmath2 and photometric extrema occur simultaneously when folded according to the 537.6 d period .",
    "this implies a clear relationship between the magnetic field and the circumstellar envelope .",
    "we interpret these observations in the context of the oblique rotator model , in which the stellar wind couples to the kilogauss dipolar magnetic field , generating a dense , structured magnetosphere , resulting in all observables varying according to the stellar rotation period .",
    "hd 108 was the second of?p star in which a magnetic field was detected ( martins et al .",
    "2010 ) . based on long - term photometric and spectroscopic monitoring , hd 108 is suspected to vary on a timescale of  50 - 60 y ( naz et al .",
    "the magnetic observations acquired by martins et al . from 2007 - 2009 show at most a marginal increase of the longitudinal field during more than 2 years of observation .",
    "this supports the proposal that the variation timescale is in fact the stellar rotational period , and that hd 108 is a magnetic oblique rotator that has undergone extreme magnetic braking .",
    "hd 148937 was recently observed intensely by the mimes collaboration , resulting in the detection of circular polarisation within line profiles indicative of the presence of an organised magnetic field of kilogauss strength ( wade et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "although the field is consistently detected in the observations , no variability is observed , in particular according to the 7.03 d spectral period .",
    "this result supports the proposal by naz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) that hd 148937 is observed with our line - of - sight near the stellar rotational pole .",
