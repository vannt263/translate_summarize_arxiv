    "a large number of problems in physics and engineering are modeled by _ systems of conservation laws _    [ eq : cauchy ] @xmath0    here , the unknown @xmath1 is the vector of _ conserved variables _ and @xmath2 is the _ flux function_. we denote @xmath3 .",
    "the system is _ hyperbolic _ if the flux jacobian @xmath4 has real eigenvalues for all @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "examples for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws include the shallow water equations of oceanography , the euler equations of gas dynamics , the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations of plasma physics , the equations of nonlinear elastodynamics and the einstein equations of general relativity .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more theory on hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "it is well known that solutions of the cauchy problem can develop discontinuities such as shock waves in finite time , even when the initial data is smooth .",
    "hence , solutions of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws are sought in the weak ( distributional ) sense .",
    "a function @xmath7 is a _ weak solution _ of if it satisfies in the sense of distributions : @xmath8 for all test functions @xmath9 .",
    "weak solutions are in general not unique : infinitely many weak solutions may exist after the formation of discontinuities . thus , to obtain uniqueness , additional admissibility criteria have to be imposed .",
    "these admissibility criteria take the form of entropy conditions , which are formulated in terms of entropy pairs .",
    "a pair of functions @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 is called an _ entropy pair _ if @xmath13 is convex and @xmath14 satisfies the compatibility condition @xmath15 .    a weak solution @xmath16 of is an _ entropy solution _ if the entropy inequality @xmath17 is satisfied for all entropy pairs @xmath10 , that is , if @xmath18 for all nonnegative test functions @xmath19 .    for the special case of scalar conservation laws ( @xmath20 ) ,",
    "every convex function @xmath13 gives rise to an entropy pair by letting @xmath21 .",
    "this rich family of entropy pairs was used by kruzkhov @xcite to obtain existence , uniqueness and stability of solutions for scalar conservation laws .",
    "corresponding ( global ) well - posedness results for systems of conservation laws are much harder to obtain . lax @xcite showed existence and stability of entropy solutions for one - dimensional systems of conservation laws for the special case of riemann initial data .",
    "existence results for the cauchy problem for one - dimensional systems were obtained by glimm in @xcite using the random choice method and by bianchini and bressan @xcite with the vanishing viscosity method .",
    "uniqueness and stability results for one - dimensional systems were shown by bressan and co - workers @xcite .",
    "all of these results rely on an assumption that the initial data is `` sufficiently small '' , i.e. , lies sufficiently close to some constant .    on the other hand ,",
    "_ no global existence and uniqueness ( stability ) results are currently available _ for a generic system of conservation laws in several space dimensions .",
    "in fact , recent results ( see @xcite and references therein ) provide counterexamples which illustrate that entropy solutions for multi - dimensional systems of conservation laws _ are not necessarily unique_. these results raise serious questions about the appropriateness of entropy solutions as the standard solution framework for systems of conservation laws .",
    "it can be argued that one needs to impose even further admissibility criteria , in addition to the entropy inequality , to single out a solution among the infinitely many solutions constructed in @xcite .",
    "one possible approach in determining these selection criteria is to employ suitable numerical schemes and observe which , if any , of the entropy solutions are approximated by these schemes .",
    "numerical schemes have played a leading role in the study of systems of conservation laws , and a wide variety of numerical methods for approximating are currently available .",
    "these include the very popular and highly successful numerical framework of finite volume and finite difference schemes , based on approximate riemann solvers or on riemann - solver - free centered differencing ( see @xcite ) which utilize tvd @xcite , eno @xcite or weno @xcite non - oscillatory reconstruction techniques and strong stability preserving ( ssp ) runge - kutta time integrators @xcite .",
    "another popular alternative is the discontinuous galerkin finite element method @xcite .",
    "the primary goal in the analysis of numerical schemes approximating is proving convergence to an entropy solution as the mesh is refined .",
    "this issue has been addressed in the special case of ( first - order ) monotone schemes for _ scalar _ conservation laws ( see @xcite for the one - dimensional case and @xcite for multiple dimensions ) using the tvd property .",
    "corresponding convergence results for ( formally ) arbitrarily high - order accurate finite difference schemes for scalar conservation laws were obtained recently in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "convergence results for ( arbitrarily high order ) space time dg discretization for scalar conservation laws were obtained in @xcite and for the spectral viscosity method in @xcite .",
    "the question of convergence of numerical schemes for systems of conservation laws is significantly harder . currently , there are _ no _ rigorous proofs of convergence for any kind of finite volume ( difference ) and finite element methods to the entropy solutions of a generic system of conservation laws , even in one space dimension .",
    "convergence aside , even the stability of numerical approximations to systems of conservation laws is mostly open .",
    "the only notion of numerical stability for systems of conservation laws that has been analyzed rigorously so far is that of entropy stability  the design of numerical approximations that satisfy a discrete version of the entropy inequality .",
    "such schemes have been devised in @xcite .",
    "however , entropy stability may not suffice to ensure the convergence of approximate solutions .",
    "given the lack of rigorous stability and convergence results for systems of conservation laws , it has become customary in the field to rely on numerical benchmark tests to demonstrate the convergence of the scheme empirically .",
    "one such benchmark test case is the radial sod shock tube @xcite .      in this test",

    "the above numerical example suggests convergence of the approximate numerical solutions to an entropy solution , at least for some benchmark test cases .",
    "the computed solutions were observed to be stable with respect to perturbations of the initial data . in the literature",
    "it is not uncommon to extrapolate from benchmark test cases like the sod shock tube and expect that the numerical approximations converge as the mesh is refined for all possible sets of flow configurations .",
    "we question the universality of the above observed empirical convergence and stability results by considering the following set of initial data for the two - dimensional euler equations ( see section [ sec:6 ] ) : @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "thus , one can not deduce convergence of even bulk properties of the flow , such as the average domain temperature , in this particular case .    finally , we check stability of the numerical solutions as the perturbation parameter @xmath39 .",
    "we compute numerical approximations at a fixed fine grid resolution of @xmath40 points with successively lower values of @xmath41 .",
    "these results are compared with the steady state solution and are presented in figure [ fig : kh - errors](b ) .",

    "this fact does not imply that the numerical approximations are at fault ( given that all the tested schemes , based on different design philosophies , behaved in the same manner ) , but rather the notion of entropy solutions does not adequately describe the complex flow phenomena that are modeled by systems of conservation laws such as the compressible euler equations .",
    "when combined with the recent results on the non - uniqueness of entropy solutions of systems of conservation laws @xcite and references therein , our numerical evidence strongly suggests that entropy solutions may not be an appropriate solution framework for systems of conservation laws , in many respects .",

    "entropy solutions are _ bounded functions _ which satisfy the equation and its associated entropy inequality(-ies ) in the sense of distributions . though the existence and uniqueness of entropy solutions has been established for scalar conservation laws ( @xmath20 ) and for one - dimensional systems ( @xmath211 ) ,",
    "there are no known global existence and uniqueness ( stability ) results for generic multi - dimensional systems , when @xmath454 .",
    "in fact , recent papers @xcite provide examples of multi - dimensional systems with infinitely many entropy solutions .      despite a wide variety of numerical methods , such as finite volume , finite difference and discontinuous galerkin methods that have been developed and successfully employed to approximate systems of conservation laws ,",
    "none of these methods has been shown to converge to an entropy solution for a generic system of conservation laws . given this background , we investigate here the issues of convergence of numerical approximations as well as the stability of the underlying entropy solutions .",
    "our numerical experiments demonstrate that even state of the art numerical methods may not necessarily converge as the mesh is refined . as shown in figures [ fig : kh - density1 ] and [ fig:3 ] , finer and finer structures emerge as the grid is refined .",
    "the production of oscillations at finer and finer scales prevents convergence under mesh refinement .",
    "we also present numerical experiments that demonstrate the lack of stability of entropy solutions with respect to perturbations of initial data ; see figures [ fig : kh - errors](b ) and [ fig:12 ] .",
    "this lack of convergence to entropy solutions should not be considered as a failure of the numerical methods .",
    "rather , they illustrate the shortcomings of the notion of entropy solutions to multi - dimensional systems of conservation laws .",
    "in particular , these experiments support the contention that entropy solutions are inadequate in describing some of the complex flow features that are modeled by systems of conservation laws such as the persistence of structures on finer and finer scales . together with the recent results on the non - uniqueness of entropy solutions , our numerical evidence motivated us to seek a different , more versatile notion of solutions for these equations .    to this end , we focus on the notion of _ entropy measure - valued ( emv ) solutions _ , first introduced by diperna in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "we propose a measure - valued cauchy problem and seek solutions that are young measures ( parametrized probability measures ) .",
    "these _ entropy measure valued solutions _ are sought to be consistent with the underlying equations in the sense of distributions and satisfy a suitable form of the entropy inequality . _",
    "the main aim _ of the current paper was then to design numerical procedure that can be rigorously shown to converge to an emv solution .",
    "we work with an equivalent representation of measures as probability laws of random fields . the resulting initial random field",
    "is then evolved using a `` reliable '' entropy stable numerical scheme .",
    "the law of the resulting ( random ) weak * convergent approximations provides an approximation to the measure valued solution . for a numerical scheme to be weak * convergent , it is required to satisfy a set of minimal criteria outlined in theorem [ thm : convmv ] :    * * uniform boundedness * of the approximations in @xmath300 ;",
    "* * discrete entropy inequality * ; * * space - time weak bv bound*.    the tecno schemes of @xcite and the space - time dg schemes of @xcite are examples of ( formally ) high - order schemes satisfying the discrete entropy inequality and weak bv bounds .",

    "thus , we provide sufficient conditions that can guide the design of such `` reliable '' numerical methods for systems of conservation laws , with particular attention to multi - dimensional systems .",

    "this is particularly striking in the specific case of the kelvin - helmholtz problem , where an entropy solution ( the steady state data ) , interpreted as an atomic entropy measure valued solution , exists but is unstable .",
    "this key observation implies that the solution operator can act to spread the support of the initial atomic measure .",
