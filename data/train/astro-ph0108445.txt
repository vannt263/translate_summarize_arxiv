    "in the soft ( 12 kev ) band , rosat surveys resolved @xmath7 of the cosmic x  ray background ( xrb ) into discrete sources , at a flux level of @xmath8 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 ( hasinger et al .",
    "the great majority of sources brighter than @xmath9 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 were optically identified with unobscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ; schmidt et al . 1998 ; lehmann et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the origin of the background at higher energies is more controversial .",
    "the asca and _ beppo_sax deep surveys achieved relatively shallow detection limits of @xmath10 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 , resolving @xmath11 of the xrb into point sources ( ogasaka et al . 1998 ;",

    "main contributors are thought to be absorbed and unabsorbed agn with a mixture of quasars and narrow emission - line galaxies as optical counterparts ( e.g. fiore et al .",
    "1999 ; akiyama et al .",
    "recently , chandra and xmm - newton have dedicated long exposures to address this issue ( mushotzky et al . 2000 ; giacconi et al . 2001a ; hornschemeier et al . 2000 , 2001 ; brandt et al . 2001 ; hasinger et al . 2001 ; tozzi et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the analysis of the first 300  ks of the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) allowed to reach limiting fluxes of @xmath12 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 ( 0.52 kev ) and @xmath13 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 ( 210 kev ; tozzi et al .",
    "similar results were obtained on the hubble deep field by chandra observations ( hornschemeier et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "these observations allowed the resolution of @xmath14 of the soft ( 12 kev ) xrb , confirming the results from the deep rosat hri surveys in the lockman hole ( hasinger et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the hard band ,",
    "the absolute value of the background is poorly established and , depending on the adopted normalization , tozzi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) were able to account for @xmath15 of the hard ( 210 kev ) xrb .",
    "the increasing angular resolution and source crowding provided by the current generation of x  ray instruments demands advanced detection algorithms . one of these is the wavelet transform ( wt ) , a mathematical tool for multi - scale image analysis .",
    "the automatic detection and characterization of sources in x  ray images by means of wt - based algorithms were first carried out by rosati et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "wt - based techniques have been developed and applied also by other groups to the analysis of rosat images ( e.g. slezak et al .",
    "1994 ; grebenev et al .",
    "1995 ; damiani et al . 1997 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998 ; lazzati et al . 1999 ) . in view of the excellent results",
    "so far obtained , it is natural to extend these techniques to the analysis of the far richer chandra images ( freeman et al .",
    "2001 ; harnden et al . 2001 : moretti et al .",
    "2001 ) . here",
    "we analyzed the full ( 0.97 ms ) cdfs ( giacconi et al .",
    "2001b ; rosati et al .",
    "2001 ) by means of an advanced detection algorithm originally developed for the analysis of the rosat hri fields ( lazzati et al . 1999 ; campana et al .",
    "1999 ) based on the wt ( brera multiscale wavelet - bmw ) . at variance with other wt algorithm , our bmw characterizes detected sources by means of a decimation scheme ( lazzati et al .",
    "the application and testing of this algorithm on chandra fields and on the cdfs in particular is extensively described in moretti et al .",
    "the cdfs consists of eleven observations for a total exposure time of 0.97 ms .",
    "all exposures were taken with the chandra x  ray observatory ( weisskopf et al . 2000 ) advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ) detector ( garmire et al .",
    "acis - i consists of four ccds arranged in a @xmath16 array for a field of view of @xmath17 .",
    "the on - axis image quality is @xmath18 fwhm , increasing to @xmath19 fwhm at @xmath20 off - axis .",
    "the data were filtered to include only the standard event grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 ( see chandra proposers observatory guide ) .",
    "all hot pixels and bad columns were removed .",
    "we removed also flickering pixels with more than two events contiguous in time ( time interval of 3.3 s ) and residual cosmic ray events .",
    "the eleven observations were co - added with a pattern recognition routine to within @xmath21 r.m.s .",
    "pointing accuracy ( moretti et al .",
    "we restricted our analysis to the acis - i area fully exposed in the eleven observations , selecting a circle with @xmath22 radius , for a total coverage of @xmath23  deg@xmath24 . in order to compare our results with previous studies we carried out the detection in two selected energy bands : a 0.52 kev soft band and a 27 kev hard band ( in the range 710 kev the effective area steeply decreases while the background increases resulting in a lower signal to noise ratio for x  ray sources ; fluxes in the hard 27 kev band",
    "are extrapolated to the classical 210 kev energy band ) .",
    "time intervals during which the background rate is larger than @xmath25 over the quiescent level were removed in each band separately .",
    "this results in a net exposure time of 942 ks in the soft band and 936 ks in the hard band .",
    "the average background over the fully exposed portion is 0.14 ( 0.19 ) counts per square arcsec in the soft ( hard ) band .",
    "following tozzi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the count - rate to flux conversion factors in the 0.52 kev and in the 210 kev bands were computed using the response matrices at the aimpoint .",
    "a count rate of 1 count s@xmath1 in the soft band corresponds to a flux of @xmath26 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 and of @xmath27 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 in the hard band .",
    "these numbers were computed assuming a galactic absorbing column of @xmath28 @xmath2 and a power law spectrum with a photon index @xmath29 ( i.e. the slope of the hard xrb ) .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are for photon indices in the range @xmath30 . as shown by tozzi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) a conversion factor changing with flux , in order to follow the hardening of the sources , results in a small variation of the log n ",
    "log s distribution , at a level of @xmath31 .    a critical parameter in the search of faint sources",
    "is represented by the detection threshold . in the context of detection by wavelet algorithms",
    "this is usually fixed in terms of spurious sources per field ( lazzati et al . 1998 ) . to compare our results with those reported by tozzi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we require to have less than 4.3 spurious sources within the selected area ( i.e. 6 spurious sources per chandra field ) . this threshold has been accurately tested with simulations and the number of spurious sources is well under control ( moretti et al .",
    "this threshold corresponds to a source significance larger than @xmath32 .",
    "we searched the inner image with the bmw - chandra detection algorithm described in moretti et al .",
    "we detect 239 and 147 sources in the soft and hard band , respectively .",
    "there are 22 sources ( @xmath33 of the total number of detected sources ) that are revealed only in the hard band , and 116 sources ( @xmath34 ) that are revealed only in the soft band .    the sky coverage at a given flux , i.e. the area over which a given source can be detected above our threshold ( as due to the varying vignetting , angular resolution and exposure time ) , has been derived by extensive simulations ( 100 fields per band ) in 4 circular annuli ( see moretti et al .",
    "the inhomogeneities of the acis - i field of view , such as gaps between the ccds , are dealt with throrough simulations .",
    "the flux distribution of the detected sources suffers from the well known eddington bias ( e.g. hasinger et al .",
    "faint sources can be detected only if superposed on positive background fluctuations ( due either to a faint contaminating source or a statistical background fluctuation ) and therefore their fluxes are systematically overestimated by factor as large as 23 .",
    "this bias starts affecting the data at a level of @xmath35 counts in the soft band ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 counts in the hard band ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this effect has a stronger impact on the 210 kev log n  log s , due to the higher value of the background .",
    "following the approach by vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we statistically correct for this bias . the completeness of the detection is then accounted for by the completeness function . the accuracy of the procedure is assured by extensive simulations ( see moretti et al .",
    "2001 and figs .",
    "45 therein ) .",
    "our simulations show that we are able to recover the number source distribution down to 4 corrected counts ( 11 before the bias correction ) in the inner core of the image , declining to 8 corrected counts ( 14 before correction ) in the outskirts for the soft band .",
    "for the hard band the limit on the corrected counts are 5 in the center and 10 in the outskirts .",
    "these counts give a flux limit in the inner region of @xmath39 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 in the soft band and @xmath40 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 in the hard band .        to characterize the flux distribution of sources detected in the soft band",
    "we performed a maximum likelihood fit to the differential ( unbinned ) source flux distribution with a power  law .",
    "we obtain as a best fit :    @xmath41    fitting the same data , adaptively binning to 10 sources per bin , we obtain a good fit by means of a @xmath42 test ( null hypothesis probability @xmath43 ) .",
    "this assures us of the goodness of the fit .",
    "the error at @xmath44 confidence level for the normalization is @xmath45 ( @xmath46 means that fluxes are measured in units of @xmath47 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 ) , while the best fit value for the slope is @xmath48 ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : lnlss ] ) . both our normalization and slope ,",
    "are in good agreement with rosat ( hasinger et al .",
    "1998 ) chandra ( tozzi et al . 2001 , rosati et al . 2001 ) and xmm - newton ( hasinger et al . 2001 ) up to their faintest flux levels .    due to galactic contributions and following all previous studies , we consider the soft xrb in the 12 kev band only .",
    "our fitted log n  log s distribution gives an integrated flux of @xmath49 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 deg@xmath50 for fluxes fainter than @xmath51 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "summing the contribution at higher fluxes ( hasinger et al .",
    "1998 ) , the total flux of resolved point sources is @xmath52 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 deg@xmath50 .",
    "this accounts for @xmath53 of the unresolved extragalactic background measured by rosat and by a joined asca / rosat analysis ( chen et al .",
    "1997 ) . extending to even lower fluxes the log n ",
    "log s distribution ( assuming the same slope ) we can make up to @xmath54 of the soft xrb , at the most .",
    "this is in line with recent predictions for the soft xrb produced by the warm / hot diffuse intergalactic medium which may contribute at a @xmath55 level ( phillips et al .",
    "if , instead , we assume the lower ( by a factor @xmath56 ) value measured by asca ( gendreau et al .",
    "1995 ) , then we are able to account for @xmath57 of the flux in the soft xrb and fully account for it extending the source distribution at the lowest level .    for the hard band our faint limit can be confidently taken down to @xmath3 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lnlsh ] ) . in order to be consistent with the results at larger fluxes",
    ", we normalized our distribution to the asca data ( della ceca et al . 2000 ) .",
    " log s distribution can not be described with a single power ",
    "law ( probability of the null hypothesis @xmath58 , fig .",
    "[ fig : lnlsh ] ) .",
    "we tried to model the data with a broken power ",
    "law and with a smoothly  jointed broken power  law .",
    "the second function gives a much better agreement with the data and it has the form :    @xmath59 \\ { \\rm cgs}.\\ ] ]    to match the bright flux end , we fixed the first slope to the asca value , i.e. @xmath60 ( della ceca et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the maximum likelihood fit yields a faint  end slope @xmath61 and a break flux @xmath62 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 ( all at @xmath44 confidence level for a single parameter ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : lnlsh ] ) .",
    "the total contribution to the xrb is then @xmath63 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 deg@xmath50 .",
    "this value has to be compared with the total ( unresolved ) xrb of @xmath64 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 deg@xmath50 from uhuru and heao-1 ( marshall et al .",
    "1980 ) , as well as with the more recent determinations from the _ beppo_sax and asca of @xmath65 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 deg@xmath50 ( chiappetti et al .",
    "1998 ; vecchi et al .",
    "1999 ; ueda et al .",
    "1999 ; ishisaki et al .",
    "2000 ; perri & giommi 2000 ) , in agreement with the old wisconsin measurements ( mccammon et al . 1983 ) .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the uhuru / heao-1 value ( considering also the error in the flux determination due to the uncertainties in the background slope , which amounts to @xmath66 ) .",
    "the slope of the faint end counts converges slower than logarithmically and thus the faint sources provide a small contribution to the x  ray background ( adding only @xmath66 more extrapolating down to zero flux ) . in this case",
    "we can claim to have fully resolved the 210 kev hard xrb . on the contrary , if we adopt the _ beppo_sax and asca value , the fraction of resolved sources in the cdfs lowers to @xmath67 . if we extrapolate our best fit distribution to lower fluxes , we can make up @xmath68 of the entire xrb , at most . if this were the case a contribution from truly diffuse emission or from a new class of sources has to be advocated .",
    "the origin of the xrb has been extensively studied since its discovery ( giacconi et al .",
    "1962 ) . in the case of the soft ( 12 kev ) xrb there is general consensus that the bulk of the emission can be ascribed to broad line agn ( i.e. seyfert 1 galaxies ; hasinger et al . 1998 ; schmidt et al . 1998 ) . at faint fluxes ( @xmath69 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 )",
    "nearby ( @xmath70 ) optically - normal galaxies are also being detected as soft sources ( barger et al .",
    "2001 ; tozzi et al . 2001 ; brandt et al .",
    "2001 ; schreier et al .",
    "our analysis of the cdfs extends these studies down to @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "we found that even at these low fluxes the log n ",
    "log s distribution can still be represented by the extrapolation from higher fluxes ( tozzi et al .",
    "2001 ) and we are able to resolve in point sources @xmath71 of the soft xrb , the main uncertainties being the sky flux itself .    in the hard band",
    "the xrb is made by the superposition of absorbed and unabsorbed sources ( setti & woltjer 1989 ) .",
    "in particular , the flat spectrum of the background ( @xmath72 ) implies a considerable absorption in most objects .",
    "several studies have emphasized the importance of the hard xrb as a probe of the evolution of the black hole population ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) .",
    "the small number of hard sources not detected in the soft band indicate that even in highly obscured agn a sizeable soft emission can still be produced due to , e.g. , scattering , partial covering of the central radiation or from starburst emission around the agn ( e.g. turner et al .",
    "this confirms that also at these extreme flux levels the ratio between soft and hard x  ray emission is @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , as shown in barger et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the effects of obscuration get significantly reduced at @xmath74 , since we observe in the soft band the harder 1.56 kev rest frame interval .    when matching the log n ",
    "log s distribution from asca/_beppo_sax with deeper data the presence of a knee is evident .",
    "we are able to constrain the log n  log s relation below and above the knee , which occurs at @xmath5 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "we found a fit to the data with a smoothly joined power law with the bright end fixed to the asca value ( 1.67 ) and the fainter one to @xmath75 . at a level of @xmath76 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2",
    "we are fully consistent with the uhuru / heao-1 estimate , whereas we make up @xmath77 of the hard xrb , if we assume the _ beppo_sax / asca value .",
    "a dedicated , multiwavelenght follow up is mandatory to exploit the enormous potential of this ( and similar ) datasets ( barger et al . 2001 ; giacconi et al .",
    "the identification of x  ray sources at the faintest limit and their optical characterization ( by means of photometric redshift ) can solve the issue of the evolution of obscured agn population at very high redshift .",
