    "<S> a. a. beilinson remarked that according to his time - line of results , advances in the ( relatively young ) field were apparently a logarithmic function of @xmath1 ; hence , one could expect to wait 100 years for the next significant milestone . </S>",
    "<S> here we allow ourselves to be more optimistic : following on a drawn - out history which begins with poincar , lefschetz , and hodge , the theory of _ normal functions _ reached maturity in the programs of bloch , griffiths , zucker , and others . </S>",
    "<S> but the recent blizzard of results and ideas , inspired by works of m. saito on admissible normal functions , and green and griffiths on the hodge conjecture , has been impressive indeed . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to further papers of theirs , significant progress has been made in work of p. brosnan , f. charles , h. clemens , h. fang , j. lewis , r. thomas , z. nie , c. schnell , c. voisin , a. young , and the authors  much of this in the last 4 years . </S>",
    "<S> this seems like a good time to try to summarize the state of the art and speculate about the future , barring ( say ) 100 more results between the time of writing and the publication of this volume .    in the classical algebraic geometry of curves , abel s theorem and jacobi inversion articulate the relationship ( involving rational integrals ) between configurations of points with integer multiplicities , or zero - cycles , and an abelian variety known as the jacobian of the curve : the latter algebraically parametrizes the cycles of degree 0 modulo the subgroup arising as divisors of meromorphic functions </S>",
    "<S> given a family @xmath2 of algebraic curves over a complete base curve @xmath3 , with smooth fibers over @xmath4 ( @xmath3 minus a finite point set @xmath5 over which fibers have double point singularities ) , poincar @xcite defined _ normal functions _ as holomorphic sections of the corresponding family of jacobians over @xmath3 which behave `` normally '' ( or `` logarithmically '' ) in some sense near the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> his main result , which says essentially that they parametrize @xmath6-dimensional cycles on @xmath2 , was then used by lefschetz ( in the context where @xmath2 is a pencil of hyperplane sections of a projective algebraic surface ) to prove his famous @xmath7 theorem for algebraic surfaces @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> together with a desire to learn more about the structure of chow groups ( the bloch - beilinson conjectures reviewed in @xmath15 ) , this can be seen as the primary motivation behind all the work described ( as well as the new results ) in this paper . in particular , in @xmath16 ( after mathematically fleshing out the poincare - lefschetz story ) we describe the attempts to directly generalize lefschetz s success to higher - codimension cycles which led to griffiths s abel - jacobi map ( from the codimension @xmath13 cycle group of a variety @xmath8 to its @xmath17 `` intermediate '' jacobian ) , horizontality and variations of mixed hodge structure , and s. zucker s `` theorem on normal functions '' . as is well - known , the breakdown ( beyond codimension 1 ) of the relationship between cycles and ( intermediate ) jacobians , and the failure of the jacobians to be algebraic , meant that the same game played in 1 parameter would not work outside very special cases .    </S>",
    "<S> it has taken nearly three decades to develop the technical underpinnings for a study of normal functions over a _ </S>",
    "<S> higher _ dimensional base @xmath3 : kashiwara s work on admissible variations of mixed hodge structure @xcite , m. saito s introduction of mixed hodge modules @xcite , multivariable nilpotent and @xmath18 orbit theorems ( @xcite,@xcite ) , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> and then in 2006 , griffiths and green had a fundamental idea tying the hodge conjecture to the presence of _ nontorsion singularities _  nontrivial invariants in local intersection cohomology  for multiparameter normal functions arising from hodge classes on algebraic varieties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we describe their main result and the follow - up work @xcite in @xmath19 . prior to </S>",
    "<S> that the reader will need some familiarity with the boundary behavior of `` admissible '' normal functions arising from higher codimension algebraic cycles . </S>",
    "<S> the two principal invariants of this behavior are called _ limits _ and _ singularities _ , and we have tried in @xmath20 to give the reader a geometric feel for these through several examples and an explanation of the precise sense in which the limit of abel - jacobi invariants ( for a family of cycles ) is again some kind of abel - jacobi invariant . in general throughout @xmath211 - 2 ( and @xmath224.5 - 6 ) normal functions are `` of geometric origin '' ( arise from cycles ) , whereas in the remainder the formal hodge - theoretic point of view dominates ( though conjecture is always in the background ) . </S>",
    "<S> we should emphasize that the first two sections are intended for a broad audience , while the last four are of a more specialized nature ; one might say that the difficulty level increases exponentially .    </S>",
    "<S> the transcendental ( non - algebraic ) nature of intermediate jacobians means that even for a normal function of geometric origin , algebraicity of its vanishing locus ( as a subset of the base @xmath3 ) , let alone its sensitivity to the field of definition of the cycle , is not a foreordained conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> following a review of schmid s nilpotent and @xmath18 orbit theorems ( which lie at the heart of the limit mixed hodge structures introduced in @xmath20 ) , in @xmath23 we explain how generalizations of those theorems to mixed hodge structures ( and multiple parameters ) have allowed complex algebraicity to be proved for the zero - loci of `` abstract '' admissible normal functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then address the field of definition in the geometric case , in particular the recent result of charles @xcite under a hypothesis on the vhs underlying the zero - locus , the situation when the family of cycles is algebraically equivalent to zero , and what all this means for filtrations on chow groups . </S>",
    "<S> another reason one would want the zero - locus to be algebraic is that the griffiths - green normal function attached to a nontrivial hodge class can then be shown , by an observation of c. schnell , to have a singularity in the intersection of the zero - locus with the boundary @xmath24 ( though this intersection could very well be empty ) .    </S>",
    "<S> now , _ a priori _ , admissible normal functions ( anf s ) are only horizontal and holomorphic sections of a jacobian bundle over @xmath25 which are highly constrained along the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> another route ( besides orbit theorems ) that leads to algebraicity of their zero - loci is the construction of a `` nron model ''  a partial compactification of the jacobian bundle satisfying a hausdorff property ( though not a complex analytic space in general ) and graphing admissible normal functions over all of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> nron models are taken up in @xmath15 ; as they are better understood they may become useful in defining global invariants of ( one or more ) normal functions . </S>",
    "<S> however , unless the underlying variation of hodge structure ( vhs ) is a nilpotent orbit the group of components of the nron model ( i.e. , the possible singularities of anf s at that point ) over a codimension@xmath26 boundary point remains mysterious . </S>",
    "<S> recent examples of m. saito @xcite and the second author @xcite show that there are analytic obstructions which prevent anf s from surjecting onto ( or even mapping nontrivially to ) the putative singularity group for anf s ( rational @xmath27 classes in the local intersection cohomology ) . at first glance </S>",
    "<S> this appears to throw the existence of singularities for griffiths - green normal functions ( and hence the hodge conjecture ) into serious doubt , but in @xmath28 we show that this concern is probably ill - founded .    the last section is devoted to a discussion of mumford - tate groups of mixed hodge structures ( introduced by y. andr @xcite ) and variations thereof , in particular those attached to admissible normal functions . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation for writing this section was again to attempt to `` force singularities to exist '' via conditions on the normal function ( e.g. , involving the zero - locus ) which maximize the monodromy of the underlying local system inside the m - t group ; we were able to markedly improve andr s maximality result ( but not to produce singularities ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the general notion of ( non)singularity of a vmhs at a boundary point is defined here ( in @xmath29 ) , which generalizes the notion of singularity of a normal function , we should point out that there is another sense in which the word `` singularity '' is used in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the singularities  of a _ period mapping associated to a vhs or vmhs _ are points where the connection has poles or the local system has monodromy ( i.e. @xmath5 in the above notation ) , and at which one must compute a limit mixed hodge structure ( lmhs ) . </S>",
    "<S> these contain the `` singularities of the vmhs '' , nearly always as a _ proper _ subset ; indeed , pure vhs never have singularities ( in the sense of @xmath29 ) , though their corresponding period mappings do .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper has its roots in the first author s talk at a conference in honor of phillip griffiths s 70th birthday at the ias , and the second author s talk at msri during the conference on the topology of stratified spaces to which this volume is dedicated . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between normal functions and stratifications occurs in the context of mixed hodge modules and the decomposition theorem @xcite , and is most explicitly on display in the construction of the multivariable nron model in @xmath15 as a topological group whose restrictions to the strata of a whitney stratification are complex lie groups . </S>",
    "<S> we want to thank the conference organizers and robert bryant for doing an excellent job at putting together and hosting a successful interdisciplinary meeting blending ( amongst other topics ) singularities and topology of complex varieties , @xmath30 and intersection cohomology , and mixed hodge theory , all of which play a role below . </S>",
    "<S> we are indebted to patrick brosnan , phillip griffiths , and james lewis for helpful conversations and sharing their ideas . </S>",
    "<S> we also want to thank heartily both referees as well as chris peters , whose comments and suggestions have made this a better paper .    </S>",
    "<S> one observation on notation is in order , mainly for experts : in order to clarify the distinction in some places between monodromy weight filtrations arising in lmhs and weight filtrations postulated as part of the data of an admissible variation of mixed hodge structure ( avmhs ) , the former are always denoted @xmath31 ( and the latter @xmath32 ) in this paper . in particular , for a degeneration of ( pure ) weight @xmath33 hs with monodromy logarithm @xmath34 , the weight filtration on the lmhs is written @xmath35 ( and centered at @xmath33 ) . while perhaps nontraditional , this is consistent with the notation @xmath36 for relative weight monodromy filtrations for ( admissible ) degenerations of mhs . </S>",
    "<S> that is , when @xmath37 is `` trivial '' ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) it is simply omitted .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to draw attention to the interesting recent article @xcite of griffiths which covers ground related to our @xmath40 , but in a complementary fashion that may also be useful to the reader . </S>"
