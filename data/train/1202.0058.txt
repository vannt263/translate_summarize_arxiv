    "since the time people find that the universe is accelerated expanding , lots of theoretical models were proposed to explain this phenomenology . in some of them , people proposed a new kind of dark energy component with negative pressure in our university , which will drive the acceleration , and the simplest dark energy model is the cosmological constant , but it suffers fine - tuning and coincidence problems . while , in other models , people try to modify the einstein gravity at large scale in the universe , e.g. @xmath1 , dgp , etc .",
    "models , then the universe can be accelerated without introducing dark energy .",
    "recently , a very interesting dark energy model called veneziano ghost dark energy ( gde ) has been proposed @xcite , and in this model , one can obtain a cosmological constant of just the right magnitude to give the observed expansion from the contribution of the ghost fields , which are supposed to be present in the low - energy effective theory of qcd without introducing any new degrees of freedom .",
    "the ghosts are needed to solve the @xmath2 problem , but they are completely decoupled from the physical sector @xcite . the ghosts make no contribution in the flat minkowski space , but make a small energy density contribution to the vacuum energy due to the off - set of the cancelation of their contribution in curved space or time - dependent background . for , example , in the rindler space , the contribution of high frequency modes is suppressed by the factor @xmath3 and the main contribution comes from @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the temperature on the horizon seen by the rindler observer @xcite . in the cosmological context , one can choice @xmath6 , which corresponds to the temperature on the hubble horizon . then",
    ", in the context of strongly interacting confining qcd with topological nontrivial sector , this effect occurs only in the time direction and their wave function in other space directions is expected to have the size of qcd energy scale .",
    "thus , this ghost gives the vacuum energy density proportional to @xmath7 . with @xmath8ev , it gives the right order of observed magnitude @xmath9ev)@xmath10 of the energy density .",
    "the recent progress on the gde model , see ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the author also consider other possibilities of the energy density form of the gde model with or without interactions and also its thermodynamical behaviors .",
    "dissipative processes in the universe including bulk viscosity , shear viscosity and heat transport have been conscientiously studied@xcite , and these dissipative effects are supposed to play a very significant role in the astrophysics @xcite and nuclear physics @xcite . therefore , it is also important to study these effects in the gde model , and in this paper , we will consider the gde model with and without bulk viscosity and constrain the relevant parameters in these models by using the latest data , and for works on viscous dark energy models , see ref.@xcite .",
    "the general theory of dissipation in relativistic imperfect fluid was put on a firm foundation by eckart@xcite , and , in a somewhat different formulation , by landau and lifshitz@xcite .",
    "this is only the first order deviation from equilibrium and may has a causality problem , the full causal theory was developed by isreal and stewart@xcite , and has also been studied in the evolution of the early universe@xcite .",
    "however , the character of the evolution equation is very complicated in the full causal theory .",
    "fortunately , once the phenomena are quasi - stationary , namely slowly varying on space and time scale characterized by the mean free path and the mean collision time of the fluid particles , the conventional theory is still valid . in the case of isotropic and homogeneous universe ,",
    "the dissipative process can be modeled as a bulk viscosity @xmath11 within a thermodynamical approach , while the shear viscosity @xmath12 can be neglected , which is consistent with the usual practice@xcite .",
    "the bulk viscosity introduces dissipation by only redefining the effective pressure , @xmath13 , according to @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the bulk viscosity coefficient and @xmath0 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the case @xmath16 , implying the bulk viscosity is proportional to the fluid s velocity vector , is physically natural , and has been considered earlier in a astrophysical context , see the review article of grn@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will perform an observational constraint on the parameters of two kinds of gde models by using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "one of them is the original model without bulk viscosity ( gde ) , and the other is the one with bulk viscosity ( vgde ) .",
    "the observational data set we used include the latest update of type ia supernova data `` union2.1 '' with 580 sne @xcite , and for comparison we also used the `` union2 '' data with 557 sne @xcite . also , we used cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) from wmap7 @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) from sdss dr7 @xcite and the observational hubble parameter data ( ohd ) from @xcite for combination constraint .",
    "we also added a new parameter @xmath17 in the vgde model and modified the public available * cosmomc * package @xcite to satisfy both kinds of these models . during the calculation , we run @xmath18 independent chains for each case , and we make sure the convergence of the chains by typically getting @xmath19 to be less than @xmath20 , see ref .",
    "@xcite and the readme file on the website of * cosmomc*.    this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : background ] , we will derive the background dynamical equations for both the vgde and gde model . in section [ sec : auto ]",
    ", we will study the future behaviors of the vgde model by using the dynamical analysis . in section [ sec : data ] , we will describe the method and data , and in section [ sec : result ] , we summarize the fitting results . in the last section , we will give some discussions and conclusions .",

    "<S> , we perform a constraint on the ghost dark energy model with and without bulk viscosity , by using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method and the combined latest observational data from the type ia supernova compilations including union2.1(580 ) and union2(557 ) , cosmic microwave background , baryon acoustic oscillation , and the observational hubble parameter data . </S>"
