    "we present a semi - empirical polar cap model which reproduces the gamma - ray luminosities inferred for seven pulsars ( we dub them _ seven samurai _ ) detected with the cgro experiments : crab , b1509 - 58 , vela , b1951 + 32 , b1706 - 44 , geminga , and b1055 - 52 .",
    "the model avoids the problem of the empirical gamma - ray death line of arons ( 1996 ) .",
    "we also address the question of expected thermal x - ray emission due to polar cap reheating by reveresed particles . with numerical calculations used to obtain @xmath0 we tried to reproduce recent _ rosat _ and _ asca _ results .",
    "the model ( see rudak & dyks 1997 for details ) is based on polar cap activity triggered by ultrarelativistic primary electrons as described by daugherty & harding ( 1982 ) .",
    "our two basic assumptions are:1 ) the energy of primary electrons @xmath3 is only a few times higher than the threshold energy required to induce pair creation in a dipolar magnetic field of surface strength @xmath4 teragauss , with other restrictions applied when necessary : @xmath5 where @xmath6 satisfies @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( rudak & ritter 1995 ) .",
    "2 ) out of @xmath11 sturrock pairs produced per each primary electron a fraction @xmath12 is subject to further acceleration and contributes to pulsar s gamma - ray emission .",
    "we obtain thus a following prescription for @xmath0 : @xmath13 where @xmath14  a characteristic energy attained by secondary particles due to acceleration  is assumed to be of the order of @xmath3 ; the parameter @xmath12 will be determined by comparing results of numerical simulations of creation of sturrock pairs with the _ cgro _ results ; @xmath15 is the goldreich - julian rate of outflow of primary electrons .",
    "= 8.4 cm    the model was confronted with the gamma - ray luminosities for seven pulsars inferred from available data from _ osse _ ( schroeder et al.1994 ) , _ comptel _ ( carramiana et al.1995 ) , and _ egret _ ( fierro 1995 , nel et al.1996 ) experiments ( assuming gamma - ray beaming angle @xmath16 in all cases ) .",
    "two evolutionary tracks in the @xmath17 space calculated for a classical pulsar ( @xmath18 g ) , and for a millisecond pulsar ( @xmath19 g ) are shown in fig.1 .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath20 , the predicted @xmath0 depends rather weakly on magnetic field strength @xmath21 as long as @xmath22 , in contrast to other existing models . due to this property",
    "the model reproduces the seven detections equally well as e.g. a simple empirical relation @xmath23 does . at the domain of millisecond pulsars ( @xmath24 ) ,",
    "@xmath0   drops significantly .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath12 in eq.2 is @xmath25 .",
    "the upper limit for j0437 - 4715 from _ egret _ is about one order of magnitude above the expected level . out of four classical pulsars with _",
    "egret _ upper limits visibly below our predictions ( see fig.1 ) b1046 - 58 and b1929 + 10 pose no threat to the model due to existing upper limits set by _ comptel_. there is no detailed information available about the other two - b0950 + 08 and b0656 + 14 .",
    "some positrons , before reaching a region of further acceleration , may be stopped by local residual longitudinal electric field and directed back to the surface .",
    "each returning positron acquires on its way an energy comparable to the energy of the primary electron , @xmath26 , and then deposits it onto the polar cap surface .",
    "a heat conductivity inwards the star , and across magnetic lines is negligible and dissipated energy is radiated out on the spot , predominantly in form of thermal x - rays , with the luminosity @xmath1 .",
    "if out of all positrons ( @xmath27 ) a fraction @xmath28 will be reversed , then @xmath29 suppose now that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a mean energy of freshly created pairs retained in their longitudinal motion ( rudak 1997 , in preparation ) .",
    "fig.2 shows @xmath1 as a function of spin - down luminosity @xmath20 calculated for _ seven samurai _ , 4 other classical pulsars , and 2 millisecond pulsars .",
    "over the wide range of @xmath20 values the calculated polar - cap x - ray luminosity behaves as @xmath32 .",
    "this formula is significantly flatter than the empirical relation @xmath33 of becker & trmper ( 1997 ) .",
    "even though some models are able to reproduce this relation with non - thermal x - ray spectra quite satisfactorily ( cheng et al.1997 ) , it seems very likely that actual x - ray spectra consist of two components : a non - thermal one - due to synchrotron radiation , and a thermal one - due to polar - cap reheating . for high @xmath20 pulsars",
    "the former component dominates , while at the low-@xmath20 end the latter component becomes visible .",
