    "there are various circumstances in mechanics where it is convenient or necessary to replace the continuous time ( temporal evolution ) parameter with a discrete parameter .",
    "computer simulation of waves is an example where the configuration of a system at time @xmath0 is calculated from a knowledge of its configuration at times @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "there have been various attempts to construct classical and quantum mechanical theories based on this notion , such as the work of cadzow @xcite , logan @xcite , maeda @xcite and lee @xcite . the work of yamamoto et al .",
    "@xcite and klimek @xcite indicates that the subject continues to receive attention .",
    "this paper considers the question : by which principles if any should continuous time mechanical theories be discretised , that is , turned into discrete time analogues ?",
    "by discretisation we do not mean the numerical approximation of continuous time mechanics such as the work of bender et al .",
    "neither do we discretise space or the dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "our attention is fixed solely on replacing a continuous dynamical evolution parameter with a discrete parameter . in this and the following paper , _ paper ii _ on discrete time classical field theory ,",
    "our interest is the construction of exact , self consistent discrete time mechanics with well specified principles , equations of motion and predictions .",
    "this is motivated by the notion that at some unimaginably small scale , time is really discrete .",
    "this has echoes in modern theories such as string theory and quantum gravity , where the planck time of @xmath3seconds sets a scale at which conventional notions of space and time break down .",
    "it could be argued that relativity requires a symmetrical treatment between time and space but this leads to the situation of a space - time lattice approach which has lost all relativistic symmetries and rotational invariance .",
    "we argue that relativity does distinguish between timelike and spacelike , and by discretising only time our approach reduces the break with relativity to a minimum .",
    "lorentz covariance is broken in our approach to field theories , discussed in _ paper ii _ , but the residual euclidean invariances permit the construct of particle like states .    it may be felt objectionable that there is no natural concept of velocity in discrete time mechanics .",
    "it could be argued that this lack destroys our intuitive feeling for dynamics based on the notion of ( say ) a particle system evolving from an initial position and an initial velocity .",
    "the right way to see the situation is in terms of real numbers . in continuous time mechanics ,",
    "we normally consider a particle as having an instantaneous position and an instantaneous velocity ( we exclude brownian particle dynamics from our definition of continuous time mechanics ) .",
    "this information requires two real numbers for every degree of freedom . in discrete time mechanics",
    ", there is no natural concept of simultaneity analogous to this .",
    "what we mean by a ",
    "particle  is something with a position at time @xmath1 _ and _ a position at time @xmath2 , which also requires two real numbers for every degree of freedom .",
    "a particle here is more properly associated with the _ link _ between two successive points in discrete time , rather than those times separately .",
    "so ultimately , the only major difference in principle between continuous time and discrete time mechanics is the lack of the limit process @xmath4 .",
    "one problem with discrete time mechanics is a lack of guiding principles at key places , which our series of papers attempts to address .",
    "for example , consider the discretisation of a system with lagrangian @xmath5 . the approach taken by most authors would be to replace the temporal derivatives by differences , symmetrise the potential in some way ,",
    "derive the analogue of the euler - lagrange equation , and finally evolve the system according to the resulting difference equation .",
    "quantities such as the energy @xmath6 which are conserved in continuous time mechanics would be monitored by calculating the value @xmath7 of the discretised hamiltonian .",
    "it is more than likely however that a naive discretisation of the hamiltonian would result in an expression @xmath8 which is not exactly conserved .",
    "this has been discovered by many authors .",
    "it is a particular merit of lee s approach @xcite that an invariant analogous to the energy drops out of the formalism , but only at the expense of a dynamically evolving discrete time interval .",
    "it is somewhat surprising therefore that a computer simulation based on the above principles should be judged good or bad according to how constant @xmath9 remains . in the absence of any proper principle for the construction of invariants of the motion it should come as no surprise to find that occasionally a quantity such as @xmath8 will vary enormously and unpredictably during the course of a simulation",
    "this happens because there are really three systems being confused ; 1 ) the original continuous time theory , 2 ) a discrete time system evolving exactly according to some well defined discretised euler - lagrange equation , and 3 ) some unknown discrete time system for which the naively discretised energy @xmath9 would be an exact constant of the motion , but only for evolution under its own discretised equation of motion , which could be very different to the equation of motion for 2 ) . on top of this",
    "there may be numerical uncertainties induced by the computer algorithms used .",
    "seen in this light , it would seem a wise policy to discretise according to definite principles which would establish conserved quantities rigorously .",
    "the construction of invariants of the motion therefore becomes one of the principal objectives of discrete time mechanics .",
    "an important first step in the process of constructing rigorous discrete time mechanics was the introduction of a discrete time action principle .",
    "this was done by cadzow @xcite , giving a discrete time analogue of the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "we shall call such an equation a _",
    "cadzow s _ _ equation _ for the system .",
    "the construction of constants of the motion was considered by maeda @xcite in the case of continuous symmetries , whilst the construction of constants of the motion analogous to the energy had been considered earlier by logan @xcite .",
    "various features found in continuous time mechanics have discrete time analogues , including noether s theorem , whilst certain other features either do not or can not have discrete time analogues .",
    "an particular problem arises for example with hamiltonian evolution and equations of motion derived using poisson brackets .",
    "not only is there no possibility here of an infinitesimal translation in time ( which thereby renders the notion of a hamiltonian problematical ) but there is no natural concept of velocity as a limit either .",
    "this makes the standard definition of conjugate momentum as the partial derivative of the lagrangian with respect to a velocity just as problematical .",
    "this has not prevented a number of authors from constructing discrete time analogues of poisson brackets , however , with various degrees of success and utility , usually with the observation that the generator of time translations is not conserved .",
    "a feature of our approach is that we have found a clear principle for the definition of conjugate momentum in discrete time mechanics .",
    "it turns out _ not _ to be the partial derivative of the  lagrangian  with respect to a difference in general , but does reduce to it in various important cases .",
    "in addition , we have avoided trying to construct hamiltonians and equations of motion derived via poisson brackets . in our formalism",
    "the hamiltonian is displaced by a logan invariant , if such a quantity can be found .",
    "fortunately such an object does exist for the important case of the harmonic oscillator , which has ramifications in discrete time field theory discussed in the next paper in this series .",
    "the overall plan for this and subsequent papers is as follows . in this paper , _",
    "paper i _ , we restrict our attention to classical and quantum point particle dynamics , reserving classical field theory to _ paper ii _ , quantum field theory to _",
    "paper iii _ , and quantum electrodynamics to",
    "_ paper iv_.    topics covered in _",
    "paper i _ are as follows .",
    "first we introduce the central concept of _ system function_. this replaces the lagrangian as the key to the dynamics . with the system function",
    "we can calculate equations of motion , constructs invariants of the motion , and quantise the system .",
    "we give a prescription for constructing the system function from a given lagrangian .",
    "we may use this prescription to embed into the system function symmetries such as gauge invariance and hence construct electrodynamics .",
    "then we discuss the construction of invariants based on the work of maeda , noether , and logan , and apply it to the harmonic oscillator , which we discuss in detail .",
    "this key system lies at the heart of particle field theory , discussed in the following papers , and it displays some important properties , such as a natural cutoff for particle energy for example .",
    "we also discuss particle electrodynamics and the grassmannian oscillator .",
    "a major part of our programme is to develop discrete time quantum mechanics and so we conclude our paper with a discussion of the principles for first quantisation .",
    "this includes the concept of system amplitude , the construction of unequal - time commutators , and compatible operators .",
    "we then discuss the construction of discrete time quantum mechanics from standard quantum mechanics via a stroboscopic approach and give an explicit example .",
    "finally we apply the schwinger action principle to the discrete time inhomogeneous harmonic oscillator to construct the feynman propagator for the oscillator , in anticipation of its use in field theory .",
    "in continuous time mechanics lagrangian dynamics is conventionally formulated via an action principle based on the action integral @xmath10=\\int_{t_i}^{t_f}dt\\,l(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{\\dot{q}},t ) , \\label{action integral}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the initial and final times respectively along some given path @xmath13 . in our version of discrete time mechanics we postulate that the dynamical variables @xmath14 are observed or sampled at a finite number of times @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , such that the intervals @xmath18 are all equal to some fundamental interval @xmath19 . for convenience we will write @xmath20 .",
    "it is possible to develop a theory where the time intervals vary dynamically along the path .",
    "such a mechanics was considered by lee @xcite .",
    "the extension of our methods to that particular situation is left for a further article .    in our formulation of discrete time mechanics we replace the action integral (",
    "[ action integral ] ) by an action sum of the form @xmath21=\\sum_{n=0}^{n-1}f^n ,   \\label{sum}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 will be referred to as the _ system function_. the system function has the same central role in discrete time mechanics as the lagrangian has in continuous time mechanics . with it",
    "we may construct the equations of motion , define conjugate momenta , construct constants of the motion and attempt to quantise the system . in principle",
    "we could consider higher order system functions which depended on ( say ) @xmath23 , @xmath24 ... , @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 but the case @xmath28 represents the simplest possibility which could give rise to non - trivial dynamics and will be considered exclusively from now on .",
    "such system functions are the discrete time analogues of lagrangians of the canonical form @xmath29    another reason for considering only a second order formulation @xmath30 is its direct relationship to hamilton s principal function , discussed presently .",
    "cadzow @xcite applied a variational principle to an action sum such as ( [ sum ] ) and derived the equation of motion @xmath31 where the symbol @xmath32 denotes an equality holding over a true or dynamical trajectory .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath33 as a _",
    "cadzow s equation of motion _ for the system .",
    "we now discuss the interpretation of this equation .",
    "suppose we have a continuous time action integral of the form ( [ action integral ] ) .",
    "first , partition the time interval @xmath34 $ ] into @xmath35 equal subintervals .",
    "then the action integral may be written as a sum of sub - integrals , i.e. , @xmath10=\\sum_{n=0}^{n-1}\\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}dt\\,l(\\mathbf{q}(t),% \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}(t),t).\\ ] ] now suppose that we fixed the co - ordinates @xmath23 at the various times @xmath36 and then chose the path connecting each pair of points ( @xmath37 to be the true or dynamical path , that is , a solution to the euler - lagrange equations of motion for those boundary conditions . if this partially extremised path is denoted by @xmath38 then we may write @xmath39=\\sum_{n=0}^{n-1}s^n ,   \\label{action sum}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is known as hamilton s principal function , being just the integral of the lagrangian along the true path from @xmath23 at time @xmath41 to @xmath42 at time @xmath43 .",
    "we recall now that the canonical momenta @xmath44 , @xmath45 at the end points @xmath46 may be obtained from hamilton s principal function via the rule @xmath47 where the superscript @xmath48 denote that the momentum at the initial time @xmath49 carries information forwards _ _ , _ _ whereas the superscript @xmath50 denotes that the momentum at the final time @xmath12 is influenced by earlier dynamics with respect to the temporal interval concerned . at this stage",
    "the action sum ( [ action sum ] ) has not been extremised fully , as the intermediate points @xmath51 have been held fixed .",
    "now suppose we went further and extremised ( [ action sum ] ) fully by variation of the previously fixed intermediate co - ordinates @xmath52",
    ". then we would find that @xmath53 this equation may be understood as the condition that the canonical momentum along the true path from @xmath54 to @xmath55 is continuous , that is , @xmath56 .",
    "we notice immediately that ( [ formal ] ) has the same formal structure as cadzow s equation ( [ cadzow ] ) provided we make the identification @xmath57 .",
    "another interpretation of cadzow s equation is that it endows the action sum with the additivity property of action integrals , which satisfy the relations @xmath58 this property holds for all trajectories in continuous time mechanics , not just for the true or classical trajectory . in the case of system functions",
    "we may write @xmath59 for some function @xmath60 of @xmath61 and @xmath42 , because cadzow s equation ( [ cadzow ] ) is equivalent to the statement that @xmath62 is independent of @xmath23 along dynamical trajectories . however , unlike action integrals , this property will not hold off the true or classical trajectory in general .",
    "@xmath63two important ideas emerge from the similarity between ( [ cadzow ] ) and ( [ formal ] ) :    @xmath64 although the concept of velocity as a limit does not occur in discrete time mechanics , we will define a unique discrete time momentum @xmath65 conjugate to @xmath23 by the rule @xmath66 this should be compared with the approach of yamamoto et al .",
    "@xcite and most other workers , where the momentum is defined as a derivative of a discretised lagrangian with respect to a difference . in our terms cadzow s equation reduces simply to the statement that we may also calculate this momentum via the rule @xmath67",
    "@xmath68 we will construct a system function @xmath69 from the temporal integral from @xmath41 to @xmath43 of a continuous time lagrangian , the question being which path to take .",
    "we can not in general consider using the true continuous time path , as this is meaningless in the context of discrete time mechanics and normally not known to us . for the particularly important case of the harmonic oscillator ,",
    "however , we can evaluate hamilton s principal function precisely and this provides us with an important check on our formalism . the path chosen in the construction of the system function",
    "will be referred to as a _",
    "virtual path_.    it is possible to choose from a number of possible virtual paths , such as those inspired by @xmath70deformed mechanics @xcite .",
    "this does not alter any of the principles we employ and simply changes the details of the system function used and hence the sort of invariants of the motion we can find . in this paper",
    "we are interested in treating time homogeneously , and so we choose a temporal lattice with a constant fundamental time interval @xmath19 . our proposed solution for the virtual path in point particle mechanics is to take the geodesic or shortest geometric path from @xmath23 to @xmath71 , the metric being normally the euclidean one in physical space ( not in co - ordinate space ) .",
    "this prescription will normally provides us with a unique system function from a given lagrangian .",
    "moreover , it should be applicable to configuration spaces with curvature and is a co - ordinate frame independent concept .",
    "it allows us to construct a gauge - invariant discrete time prescription for electrodynamics , with a suitable modification . in _ paper ii",
    "_ of this series we shall show that we can apply this prescription successfully to field theories also",
    ". there may be important cases where the chosen virtual path is not a linear interpolation .",
    "this occurs for charged fields in the next paper in the series . in such cases , additional requirements such as gauge invariance",
    "will influence the choice of virtual path .    to illustrate the procedure ,",
    "consider a non - relativistic particle with position vector @xmath72 and lagrangian @xmath73 .",
    "then the virtual path @xmath74 taken between @xmath75 and @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 . with this choice of virtual path the time derivative become a difference operator .",
    "specifically , we find @xmath80 where we define @xmath81 then we construct the system function via the rule @xmath82 the use of this integration does not imply that continuous time is regarded as meaningful in the context of discrete time mechanics .",
    "we are interested only in the results , not in the means of obtaining these results .",
    "a useful analogy is with the use of classical mechanics to set up quantum mechanical models .",
    "once we have found our quantum theory , we need no longer to regard the classical model which generated it as any more than some approximation useful in some circumstances . our prescription allows us to embed into our system function fundamental properties such as gauge invariance and other symmetries of importance to physics .",
    "if the lagrangian is a real analytic function of its arguments then we may make a taylor expansion about @xmath83 and integrate term by term",
    ". this will be valid for lagrangians which are polynomial functions of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "in such cases the system function @xmath69 would be given by the formal expression @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the operator @xmath88 and @xmath89 and @xmath83 are considered independent at this stage .",
    "some examples will illustrate the process . for a particle in one dimension with lagrangian @xmath90 where the @xmath91 are constants , the system function",
    "is given formally by @xmath92 for instance , the anharmonic oscillator lagrangian @xmath93 gives the system function @xmath94 this differs from the anharmonic oscillator system function discussed in @xcite , which illustrates the general problem with discrete time mechanics .",
    "there may be many possible discretisation of a given continuous time system , all of which lead back to the continuous time theory when we take appropriate limits .",
    "the principle specified above gives us a unique discretisation ( subject to choice of virtual path ) .",
    "for the coulombic potential problem in three spatial dimensions , the lagrangian @xmath95 with virtual path @xmath96 gives the system function @xmath97 this system function leads to cadzow s equations of motion which preserve the discrete time analogue of orbital angular momentum .",
    "this system function is markedly different in form to the original coulombic lagrangian @xmath98 but if we consider trajectories for which we may write @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 for each @xmath102 , then @xmath103 which corresponds with @xmath104 .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that there will be many discrete time trajectories for which this limit can not be taken .",
    "for example , there may be trajectories where the particle repeatedly flips between two fixed positions only .",
    "this may happen with the discrete time harmonic oscillator , for example , and no limit such as the one discussed above exists for such a trajectory .",
    "discrete time mechanics is inherently richer in its set of possible trajectories than continuous time mechanics .    in general , cadzow s equations",

    "indeed , by taking the fundamental time interval @xmath19 small enough , it would appear possible to duplicate or approximate conventional theory as closely as required .",
    "the obvious question , _ why consider discrete time mechanics at all ? _ has two replies .",
    "first , it may be the case after all that there is some fundamental limit to time intervals , and so it becomes a matter of curiosity as to how far we can go along that road .",
    "second , there may be some novel properties in this approach which could prevent or alleviate the notorious problems with divergences which plague conventional field theories .",
    "it is worth considering any approach to the regularisation in field theory which is based on just one assumption , namely that of a discrete time .",
    "the behaviour of the discrete time oscillator holds the promise of potentially useful properties which may provide a cutoff for particle energy .    in the next paper",
    "we apply our methods to classical field theories .",
