    "for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the well - known constantly being revised unified model ( @xcite , more recent review can be found in @xcite ) can be applied to explain most of the different observed phenomena of different kinds of agn , due to the different orientation angles of the central accretion disk combining with the different central accretion rates , the different covering factors of the dust torus etc .. based on the unified model , one simple viewpoint is that type 2 agn ( no broad emission lines in observed spectra ) are intrinsically like type 1 agn ( apparent broad lines in observed spectra ) , but their broad - line regions ( blrs ) are hidden from our view by the dust torus and/or high density dust clouds .",
    "this simple viewpoint can be strongly supported by the clearly detected polarized broad emission lines and/or by the clearly detected broad infrared broad emission lines for some type 2 agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the increasing number of studies , especially on the analysis of the x - ray band characters and the analysis on the polarimetric spectral properties for some type 2 objects , have shown that besides the type 1 agn ( including those seriously obscured objects , such as type 1.5 , type 1.9 agn etc . ) and the type 2 agn , there is one special kind of agn , blr - less agn ( named as true type 2 agn or agn without hidden blrs in some references ) : agn without central blrs ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on the polarimetric spectral features and/or based on the photometric magnitude variabilities , around 70 blr - less agns have been reported and discussed in the literature .",
    "besides the contributions to improve the unified model for agn , a study the properties of the blr - less agns should provide more information on the formation ( or the suppression ) of the blr of agn , and/or additional information about transition stages of the accretion etc .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "so far , there have been several methods proposed to explain the blr absence in agns . based on the spectropolarimetric sample from tran ( 2001 ) ,",
    "@xcite have shown that the absence or presence of the hidden blr in the type 2 agns is controlled by the central accretion , under the assumption that the blrs are formed by the accretion disk instabilities occurring around the critical radius at which the gas pressure dominated accretion disk changes to being dominated by the radiation pressure ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that blr can not be able to survive , if central luminosity is much lower . @xcite",
    "have shown that the disk - wind scenario for blr and torus obscuration predicts the disappearance of the blr for agns at low luminosities .",
    "more recently , @xcite have shown that for the low luminosity agns containing adaf , the inner small cold disk is evaporated completely and the outer thin accretion disk may be seriously suppressed , which leads to the lack of the blr . however , based on the study of the current sample of the blr - less agns , the reason of the blr absence in blr - less agn is still controversial .",
    "@xcite supported the model proposed by @xcite , through a sample of 18 blr - less agns ( @xcite ) and a sample of 36 blr - less agns ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have found that the blr absence in the blr - less agns is probably caused by the less massive black holes and the high accretion rates similar to those in narrow line seyfert i objects , through a sample of 46 blr - less agns . @xcite",
    "have shown that the lack of blr could be probably caused by low gas - to - dust ratios , through a sample of 69 blr - less agns . @xcite",
    "have shown that the agn luminosity plays a major role in the blr absence in the blr - less agns , while for the high - luminosity blr - less agns , the blr absence depends not only on the agn activity , but also on the torus obscuration , through a sample of 49 blr - less agns . @xcite",
    "have shown that the blr absence in the luminous blr - less agns depends on the obscuration , however , the blr absence the less luminous blr - less agns depends on the very low eddington ratio rather than the obscuration , based on a sample of 71 blr - less agns . @xcite",
    "have shown that in order to explain the nitrogen overabundance for the blr - less agns , there should be apparent effects from stellar evolution , based on a sample of 33 blr - less agns .",
    "due to the current small sample of the blr - less agns reported in the literature , some contradictory statements about the properties of the blr - less agns have been reported , which arise mainly due to the limited size of the current sample of the blr - less agns and/or due to the different methods to select the candidates for the blr - less agns .",
    "thus , in this manuscript , we increase the current sample of the blr - less agns .",
    "it is clear that the most direct method to select the blr - less agns is through the polarimetric spectral properties ( such as the sample in tran 2001 ) , and through the continuum variabilities of the pure narrow line objects ( such as the sample in @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) stripe82 database , covering the region with the right ascension from 20.7h to 3.3h and with the declination from -1.26 to 1.26 , provides an idea to collect the blr - less agns through the properties of the sdss spectra and the photometric variabilities .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe our procedures to collect the candidates for the blr - less agns , based on both the sdss spectral features and the properties of the photometry variabilities through the sdss stripe82 database .",
    "then , our discussions , conclusions and our simple and basic results about the primary parameters of our blr - less agns are shown in the section 3 .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 have been adopted .",
    "in order to select the reliable candidates for the blr - less agns through both the photometry variabilities and the observed spectral features , we applies the following procedures to the objects in the sdss stripe82 database .",
    "the emission line parameters should be firstly determined , in order to confirm that our spectroscopic sample includes the pure narrow line objects only ( type 2 objects , the objects having both strong and weak broad lines can not be considered ) .",
    "then , the sdss photometric light curves of the objects in the spectroscopic sample should be carefully analysed to find the reliable candidates for the blr - less agns .",
    "the sdss stripe82 region consists of two scan regions referred to as the north and the south strips . both the north and the south strips",
    "have been repeatedly imaged since 1998 .",
    "a brief description of the stripe82 data and coadd can be found in @xcite .",
    "some detailed descriptions about the constructions for the corrected photometric light - motion curves for the objects in the stripe82 region can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein . using the properties of the photometric light curves of the spectroscopic objects in the stripe82 region",
    ", we are coming to find the reliable candidates for the blr - less agns .    because the line parameters ( especially , line width and line flux ) are necessary for us to create our spectroscopic sample for the blr - less agns : only pure narrow line objects with high quality sdss spectra are considered in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "the following two data files have been collected from the sdss website ( http://www.sdss3.org/dr8/spectro/spectro_access.php ) : specobj - dr8.fits which provides the information about the redshifts , the classifications , the positions etc .",
    "for all the sdss spectroscopic objects in the sdss dr8 , and galspecindx - dr8.fits which provides the information about the line parameters for all the sdss spectroscopic objects in the sdss dr8 . then based on the information of the ra and the dec for all the objects in the sdss dr8 : @xmath9 and @xmath10 , 229318 sdss spectroscopic objects with redshift less than 0.35 covered by the stripe82 region",
    "are firstly selected . here , the restriction on the redshift is applied to ensure the spectra of the collected objects cover both h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 , in order to check whether there are broad lines .",
    "based on the sdss pipeline , there are 114788 of 229318 objects classified as galaxy , 92642 of 229318 objects classified as star and 21888 of 229318 objects classified as qso.    then , by the selected 229318 spectroscopic objects covered in the stripe82 region , it is straightforward to create our spectroscopic sample including the pure narrow line objects , based on the measured line parameters for all the objects except the stars covered by the stripe82 region . due to the contributions from the stellar lights ,",
    "the spectral decomposition should be firstly applied . in other words , before to measure the line parameters of the emission lines , the contributions of the stars to the sdss spectrum should be subtracted . here",
    ", the most commonly accepted `` simple stellar population '' ( ssp ) method is applied : the stellar contributions in the observed sdss spectrum can be best fitted and subtracted by the linear combination of the ssps .",
    "the ssp method provides the fundamental link between theory / models and observations : @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the observed spectrum , @xmath15 represents one small wavelength shift between the observed spectrum and the ssps , @xmath16 represents one intrinsic reddening factor , @xmath17 represents the agn component ( commonly described by one power - law function ) with the reddening factor @xmath16 , @xmath18 means the ssp components with the wavelength shift @xmath15 and with the reddening factor @xmath16 , @xmath19 means one broadening function with the broadening velocity @xmath20 ( commonly , the stellar velocity dispersion ) .    here , we exploit the 39 simple stellar population templates from the @xcite , which include the population age from 5 myr to 12 gyr , with three solar metallicities ( z = 0.008 , 0.05 , 0.02 ) . as the detailed discussion in @xcite , the 39 templates can be used to well - describe the characters of nearly all the galaxies in sdss , such as the distributions of the stellar masses , ages , metallicities etc .. then through the levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization method applied for the sdss spectra with the emission lines being masked , the stellar component and the agn power law continuum component in the sdss spectra can be clearly determined and separated .",
    "a detailed descriptions of the ssp method can be found in @xcite etc .. there are several other methods than ssp used for the spectral decomposition , such as the pca ( principle component analysis ) method ( @xcite ) , ica ( independent component analysis ) method ( @xcite ) .",
    "each method has its own advantages and disadvantages . here ,",
    "the ssp method is used , because the ssp method results can provide the direct stellar properties , and moreover the ssp templates can be conveniently collected from the literature .",
    "some examples for the spectral decomposition can be found in figure  [ sp_decom ] . from the results shown in the figure ,",
    "it is clear that both the stellar components and the power law continuum component can be clearly subtracted from the observed sdss spectrum .",
    "the four objects shown in the figure are four reliable candidates in our final sample of the candidates for the blr - less agns .",
    "once the stellar components are subtracted out , the emission lines can be measured . here",
    ", we mainly focus on the emission lines around the h@xmath11 and the h@xmath12 , including the optical fe  ii emission lines , the broad he  ii@xmath21 line , the common / extended [ o  iii]@xmath22 doublet , the narrow / broad h@xmath12 , the [ o  i]@xmath23 doublet , the [ n  ii]@xmath24 doublet , the [ s  ii]@xmath25 doublet and the narrow / broad h@xmath11 . here , the narrow / broad h@xmath26 and h@xmath27 lines are not considered , due to their weakness , which have no effects on our following results .",
    "it is straightforward to measure the line parameters by simple gaussian functions applied to the emission lines combined with one power law function used for the agn continuum , after the subtraction of the stellar contributions . each narrow gaussian function ( full - width at half maximum less than 800@xmath28 ) is applied for each narrow emission line , except the extended components of the [ o  iii]@xmath22 doublet . for the [ o  iii ]",
    "doublet , besides the normal narrow gaussian functions , there are two broad gaussian functions applied for the extended wings of the doublet as discussed in @xcite . for the doublets [ o  iii ] and [ n  ii ] , the center wavelength ratio ,",
    "flux ratio and width ratio are fixed to the theoretical values .",
    "for the doublets [ o  i ] and [ s  ii ] , only the center wavelength ratio and the width ratio are fixed to the theoretical values .",
    "two broad gaussian functions ( full - width at half maximum larger than 600@xmath28 ) are applied for the broad h@xmath11 ( h@xmath12 ) , i.e. , one normal broad function and one much extended broad function .",
    "a simple broad gaussian function is sufficient to describe observed broad h@xmath11 ( h@xmath12 ) of a part of the objects .",
    "the main reason to describe the broad balmer lines by two broad gaussian functions is only to find more better description for the broad line profile , in order to reject the objects with probable broad balmer lines .",
    "to further discuss why two broad components are much preferred for some objects are beyond the scope of the manuscript .",
    "then , one broadened fe  ii template spectra is applied for the probable fe  ii components within the wavelength range from 4100@xmath29 to 5600@xmath29 ( @xcite ) . here , the method described in @xcite is applied to measure the fe  ii properties . finally ,",
    "using the levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization method , the line parameters ( including the fe  ii ) and the characters of the agn continuum emission can be determined .    then , based on the measured line parameters : @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the measured line parameters and the correspond uncertainties ) , among the 136676 objects ( 114788 objects classified as galaxy and 21888 objects classified as qso , through the sdss pipeline ) , 27806 pure narrow objects ( 67 of 21888 qso objects and 27739 of 114788 galaxy objects ) have apparent and strong narrow emission lines of [ o  iii ] and [ n  ii ] doublets , but no broad emission lines . moreover , there are 60066 objects ( 394 of 21888 qsos and 59672 of 114788 galaxies ) having much weaker narrow emission lines and no broad lines . for the objects with no broad , the parameter subclass listed in the sdss data",
    "file specobj - dr8.fits is considered , only the objects with the spectroscopic subclassification not including broadline are considered . finally , the total 87872 objects ( 27806 pure narrow line objects , and 60066 objects with much weaker narrow lines and no broad lines ) are maken up of our first sample .",
    "then , simple classification for the 87872 objects can be done through the well - known bpt diagram ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are 17123 objects classified as agns ( seyfert galaxies and liners ) , 23144 objects classified as hii galaxies , and 47605 objects not classified due to the less information of narrow line ratios .",
    "figure  [ bpt ] shows the properties of the objects with strong narrow lines in the bpt diagram . if strong narrow lines are apparent , the commonly used line ratios of [ o  iii]/h@xmath12 and [ n  ii]/h@xmath11 are used for the classification .",
    "if only one line ratio is available , the agn classification can be done by [ o  iii]/h@xmath12 larger than 10 ( or [ n  ii]/h@xmath11 larger than 1 ) .",
    "there are two more points we should note . on the one hand , although the sdss standard pipeline output has been used to classify the objects into galaxy and qso , some objects classified as galaxy have apparent broad lines , and some objects classified as qso have apparent stellar components .",
    "hence , the spectral decomposition is applied to all the spectroscopic objects ( galaxies and qsos ) observed in the stripe82 region . on the other hand , when the bpt diagram is used for the classification , the line ratios of [ o  iii]/h@xmath12 and [ n  ii]/h@xmath11 are mainly considered .",
    "the other line ratios , such as [ o  ii]/h@xmath12 and [ s  ii]/h@xmath11 are not considered , due to the weak line intensities and/or large effects from the extinction on the line ratios .",
    "our spectroscopic candidates are expected to have the spectral features of the blr - less agns , which are no broad emission lines but apparent power law continuum emission . here , the spectral decomposition results are discussed for the pure narrow line objects with strong agn continuum emissions .",
    "first , we check the linear correlation between the agn continuum luminosity and the broad line luminosity reported by greene & ho ( 2005 ) for pure qsos , in order to confirm that we reliably measured agn continuum luminosities .",
    "figure  [ type1_con_broad ] shows the correlation for the 815 pure type 1 agns of which spectra include both apparent broad balmer lines and apparent stellar lights in the stripe82 region .",
    "the main reason for not considering the obscured broad line agns ( having broad h@xmath11 but much weak broad h@xmath12 ) is to avoid the effects of the internal extinctions .",
    "the luminosity of the broad h@xmath12 is the total luminosity , in spite of the broad h@xmath12 being described by one or two broad gaussian components .",
    "the strong linear correlation is present : the spearman rank correlation coefficient 0.82 with @xmath33 .",
    "including the uncertainties in both coordinates , the linear correlation can be written as , @xmath34 the result is comparable to the one in greene & ho ( 2005 ) , and indicates our spectral decomposition results are reliable .",
    "the right panel of the figure  [ type1_con_broad ] shows the strong luminosity correlation between the broad h@xmath11 and the broad h@xmath12 for the 815 pure type 1 agns , which will indicate whether our measured line parameters are reliable .",
    "the correlation coefficient is about 0.87 with @xmath33 .",
    "the best fitted result for the luminosity correlation is @xmath35 , which indicates small internal extinction for the results in the left panel of figure  [ type1_con_broad ] .",
    "based on the spectral decomposition results , the following three criteria are used to select for the pure narrow line objects as our spectroscopic candidates for the nlr - less agns , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 mean the contributions to the continuum at 5100from stellar light and from the agn continuum emission , @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent the measured line parameters for at least three of the narrow lines ( narrow h@xmath12 , h@xmath11 , [ o  iii ] doublet , [ n  ii ] doublet , [ s  ii ] doublet , [ o  i ] doublet ) .",
    "the first criterion ensures the existence of the agn continuum emission , the second criterion confirms the stellar component , and the third criterion shows there are at least three normal narrow spectral emission lines . here",
    ", the critical values for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are determined as follows .",
    "the value 17% was accepted as the standard flux uncertainty , based on the measured line parameters of the broad balmer lines of the 815 pure type 1 agns shown in figure  [ type1_con_broad ] .",
    "therefore , the strength of the agn continuum emission ( stellar lights ) is at least twice the uncertainties and indicate there are apparent and reliable agn continuum emission ( stellar lights ) , thus @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) should be at least larger than @xmath43 .    using the three criteria above , there are 22693 narrow line objects selected as our spectroscopic sample of the candidates for the blr - less agns . among the 22693 narrow line objects",
    ", 877 objects can be classified as agns ( seyfert and liner objects ) , 12577 objects can be classified as hii galaxies , based on the bpt line ratios of [ o  iii]/h@xmath12 and [ n  ii]/h@xmath11 , and 9239 objects can not be classified due to insufficient narrow line information . the bpt diagram can be used to classify the narrow emission line objects . in order to show that the classified hii galaxies by the bpt line ratios can have apparent agn power law continuum emission",
    ", we show the properties of all the 1790 broad line agns ( including the high luminosity qsos ) having both broad h@xmath11 and broad h@xmath12 in the stripe82 region in the bpt diagram of [ o  iii]/h@xmath12 versus [ n  ii]/h@xmath11 in figure  [ broad_bpt ] . because of the insufficient number of narrow lines , some broad line agns in the stripe82 region are not considered in the bpt diagram .",
    "it is clear that even for the broad line agn , part of the broad line objects lie below the decomposition line between the hii galaxies and agns ( seyfert galaxies and liners ) ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 , kewley et al .",
    "similar results can also be found in schawinski et al .",
    "thus , we can reasonably accept the apparent power law continuum component in the spectra of part of the hii galaxies .",
    "finally , our spectroscopic sample includes 22693 pure narrow line objects ( 9239 non - classified objects and 13454 classified objects ) .",
    "the objects in the sample have apparent power law continuum emission , apparent narrow spectral emission lines , apparent stellar lights , but no broad lines .",
    "the spectral features of the objects are akin to the expected spectral features of the blr - less agns . besides the spectral features described above",
    ", the properties of the photometric variabilities should be used to find the candidates with high confidence levels for the blr - less agns , because variability is one of the fundamental characters of agn .",
    "it is convenient to check the properties of the photometry variabilities of the objects in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "the photometry light curves spanning over seven years in the stripe82 database are discussed in detail in @xcite . through the database provided by bramich et al .",
    "( 2008 , http://das.sdss.org/va/stripe_82_variability/sdss_82_public/ ) , we can conveniently collect the the sdss five band light curves ( with exponential and point spread function ( psf ) magnitudes along with uncertainties ) and the necessary corresponding parameters on the light curves ( such as the rms scatter , object type , stetson and vidrih variability indices etc . ) for all the objects in the sdss stripe82 region .",
    "then , based on the photometry variability properties , the following procedures are applied to find the reliable candidates for the blr - less agns .",
    "it is commonly and well known that there are two important parameters to describe the photometry variabilities and to determine and select the true variable objects : the rms photometry magnitude deviation ( @xmath2 ) as the function of the magnitude ( see the results in bramich et al .",
    "2008 , kozlowshi et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) and the correlation coefficient @xmath3 between two different band light curves ( see more recent definition in kozlowski et al .",
    "2010 ) . in this subsection",
    ", we check the properties of the two parameters for the pure narrow line objects in our spectroscopic sample , in order to find objects with true and reliable variabilities , which will be our final candidates for the blr - less agns .",
    "certainly , in order to find more reliable rms magnitude deviations ( @xmath2 ) and correlation coefficients , only the objects having more than 10 reliable photometry observations are considered .    before proceeding further , some simple descriptions are shown on the parameters of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . here",
    ", the parameter @xmath3 is the pearson s correlation coefficient between two different band light curves , an expected feature of truly variable objects . and",
    ", the dependence of the function of @xmath2 on photometry magnitude is described as @xmath44 as posed in bramich et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and then determined as follows . in the plane of photometry magnitude and",
    "the rms , all the spectroscopic objects ( galaxies ) in the stripe82 region are binned into 0.1mag . and moreover , in order to ignore the effects of the objects with large variabilities , we only consider the objects having their own standard deviations less than the corresponding rms magnitude deviation for all objects in the corresponding bin .",
    "then the rms functions for the sdss bands are found as @xmath45 due to the some significantly poorer signal - to - noise for sdss u and z bands , we mainly consider and show the results on the sdss gri bands in the manuscript . figure  [ mag_rms ] shows the corresponding results about the @xmath2 ( the solid line the left panels ) , @xmath46 ( correlation between g band and r band light curves ) , @xmath47 ( correlation between g band and i band light curves ) and @xmath48 ( correlation between r band and i band light curves ) for all the galaxies and qsos in the stripe82 region .",
    "then , the determined @xmath2 function and the calculated @xmath3 can be used as the variability indicators , and will mean larger rms values and higher pearson s coefficients , for true variabilities : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 mean the rms magnitude deviation for the @xmath52 object in the given sdss band and the calculated rms photometry magnitude deviation calculated by the @xmath2 function given the mean photometry magnitude in the given band of the object . follow the procedures in kozlowski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , we estimate the fraction of the false - positives among the selected objects with true variabilities by @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) means the number of the selected objects with pearson s coefficients between two given band light curves smaller than 0.5 ( larger than @xmath56 ) . here , we accept that the weak- or un - correlated objects have the pearson s coefficient smaller than 0.5 .",
    "similar to we adopt , in kozlowski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the critical value is @xmath57 for highly correlated objects",
    ". however , in the manuscript , we require the determined @xmath58 to be smaller than 10% for our following selected candidates for the blr - less agns , which leads to @xmath59 for three sdss bands , @xmath60 for selecting candidates for the blr - less agns through the r and i band results , @xmath61 for selecting the candidates through the g and r band results and @xmath62 for selecting the candidates through the g and i band results . here",
    ", the value @xmath63 strongly guarantees the variability significance .",
    "then based on the critical values @xmath56 and the calculated @xmath2 values , the reliable 281 candidates for the blr - less agns can be selected .",
    "the 281 reliable candidates for the blr - less agns have the following feature : * true and apparent agn continuum variabilities , apparent narrow emission lines , and no broad emission lines*. among the 281 candidates , there are 9 agns , 171 hii galaxies and 101 non - classified objects nu the sdss . meanwhile , the expected number of false - positives among the candidates is less than 30 ( @xmath58 less than 10% ) .",
    "the properties of the rms functions for the reliable candidates are shown in the left panels in figure  [ mag_rms2 ] . because only two band light curves out of three three band ( sdss gri bands ) light curves are available for some of the candidates .",
    "therefore , in the figure , 133 of the 281 candidates are shown in top left panel , 202 of the 281 candidates are shown in the middle left panel , and 209 of 281 candidates are shown in the bottom left panel . figure  [ mag_rms2 ] also shows the normal narrow line objects in the spectroscopic sample ( contour in solid line in the figure ) and all the spectroscopic qsos with redshift less than 0.35 ( contour in dotted line in the figure ) in the stripe82 region .",
    "the larger variabilities ( @xmath64 ) of the candidates than those of a large part of qsos provide further evidence for the true variabilities of the candidates .",
    "finally , based on both the spectral characters and the photometry variabilities , 281 reliable candidates are included in our final sample . the basic information of the candidates is listed in table 1 , including the sdss mjd - plate - fiberid information , the redshift , the position , the r band magnitude , the values of @xmath41 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and classification .",
    "based on the photometry variabilities of the spectroscopic objects from the sdss stripe82 region , we selected 281 candidates for the blr - less agns with high confidence levels .",
    "we discuss three points / caveats of our spectral analysis below .    first and foremost , the determined power law agn continuum component is one necessary parameter to select the candidates for the blr - less agns , based on the definition of the blr - less agn : the nuclei are directly observed .",
    "thus , the reliability of the agn continuum determination based on the spectral decomposition , should be carefully further discussed , besides the results shown in the figure  [ type1_con_broad ] .",
    "the sum of the pure ssps gives one power law continuum feature , unless the broadening velocity for the ssps is unreasonably large or only the much younger ssps are included .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath0 mathematically support the reliability of the power law agn continuum component .",
    "furthermore , in order to provide clearer evidence for the reliability of the agn continuum determination , the procedure in the subsection 2.1 is re - applied without the considerations of the agn continuum component @xmath17 for the observed spectra of the final 281 candidates for the blr - less agns in our final sample .",
    "then , the f - test technique is applied to check the reliability of the agn component @xmath17 , @xmath67 where @xmath68 represents the sum of squared residuals for one model , the suffix 1 is for the simple model and 2 is for the slightly complicated model , @xmath69 represents the degree of freedom for one model .",
    "then , the calculated value @xmath70 should be compared to the f - value estimated by the f - distribution with the numerator degrees of freedom of @xmath71 and the denominator degrees of freedom of @xmath72 .",
    "it is clear that the f - value by the f - distribution with @xmath73 is @xmath74 based on the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom .",
    "the calculated @xmath70 values through the equation above are much larger than 3 , as the shown results in the figure  [ ftest ] .",
    "thus , the mathematical f - test results support the agn component @xmath17 .",
    "second , we simply check the properties of the the intrinsic dust extinction included in the procedure in the subsection 2.1 .",
    "a detailed discussions of the correlation between the dust extinctions and the other stellar parameters are beyond the scope of the manuscript ( more recent detailed discussions can be found in xiao et al .",

    "we discuss one simple result about the dust extinction . based on the study of starforming galaxies ,",
    "the mean dust extinction e(b - v ) is around 0.4 and smaller than 1 ( due to much weak h@xmath12 ) . in other words ,",
    "if our procedure from the subsection 2.1 is available for the spectral decomposition , the parameter of the dust extinction should be around 0.4 ( see results in xiao et al .",
    "2012 , zahid et al . 2013 and references therein ) .",
    "figure  [ ebv ] shows the distributions of the dust extinctions determined by the procedures with and without the considerations of the component @xmath17 .",
    "it is clear that e(b - v ) is around 0.3 with the considerations of @xmath17 , but e(b - v ) is larger than 1 without the considerations of the @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the agn component @xmath17 is physically necessary and reliable .",
    "last but not least , the final point we should make is that there should be no broad emission lines in the sdss spectra for the 281 candidates for the blr - less agns , based on the definition of blr - less agns . besides the fitted results as discussed in the subsection 2.1 .",
    "the final mean spectrum of the candidates for the blr - less agns is discussed . here",
    ", the mean spectrum is determined by the pca technique ( principal components analysis or karhunen - loeve transform method ) applied for all the 281 sdss spectra with the power law continuum and the stellar components having been subtracted . then the first principal component should represent the mean emission line spectrum of the 281 objects .",
    "figure  [ mean ] shows the mean spectrum for the candidates for the 281 blr - less agns .",
    "it is clear that there are no broad emission lines . in other words",
    ", we can confirm the selected 281 objects have no broad line with the accepted sdss spectral quality .",
    "based on the discussions above , we believe although some part of the candidates for the blr - less agns have been lost , due to the spectral quality , the quality of the sdss stripe light curves and the strict criteria shown in equation ( 5 ) , the selected final candidates for the blr - less agns have high confidence levels .",
    "now , some following basic discussions can be shown for the properties the candidates for the blr - less agns .",
    "we firstly check the dependence of the blr - less agns on the luminosity and the accretion rate as discussed in the introduction .",
    "figure  [ lum ] shows the distributions of the continuum luminosity at 5100@xmath29 for the candidates for the blr - less agns and for the broad line agns .",
    "the mean values for the continuum luminosities at 5100are @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the broad line agns and the candidates for the blr - less agns respectively .",
    "the luminosity ratio between the blr - less agns and normal broad line agns is similar as the value shown in tran ( 2003 ) , but with larger scatter .",
    "then , the accretion rate described by the dimensionless eddington parameter is checked for the normal broad line agns and for the candidates for the blr - less agns ( @xmath77 ) , and shown in figure  [ lum ] .",
    "the mean values of the dimensionless eddington accretion rate are @xmath78 and @xmath79 for the broad line agns and the candidates for the blr - less agns respectively . here , the bolometric luminosity is determined by the agn continuum luminosity ( elvis et al .",
    "1994 , laor 2000 , netzer 2003 , vestergaard 2004 , richards et al .",
    "2006 , marconi et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the eddington luminosity is determined by the black hole mass through the m - sigma relation ( gebhardt et al . , 2000 ,",
    "ferrarese & merritt 2001 , tremaine et al .",
    "2002 , gltekin et al .",
    "2009 , woo et al .",
    "the result indicates the accretion rates for the blr - less agns and the normal agns are not much different .    finally , our conclusions are as follows .",
    "based on the ssp templates , the spectra of all the galaxies and qsos in the sdss stripe82 region have been analysed , and then 22693 pure narrow line objects with apparent power law continuum components ( @xmath0 and @xmath80 ) but no broad emission lines are selected to make up of the spectroscopic sample for the candidates for the blr - less agns .",
    "then , the properties of t he photometry variability are checked for the objects in the spectroscopic sample . by the properties of the rms magnitude deviation ( @xmath2 ) and the pearson s coefficients ( @xmath3 ) between two different sdss band light curves : @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the final 281 objects are our selected reliable candidates for the blr - less agns , which have reliable photometric variabilities and have reliable agn continuum emission but do not have broad emission lines .",
    "the reported sample four - times enlarges the current sample of the blr - less agns , and will provide more reliable information to explain the lack of the blrs of agns in our following studies .",
