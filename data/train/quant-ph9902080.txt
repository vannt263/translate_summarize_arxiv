    "the notion of a projective quantum measurement was introduced by von neumann@xcite in his treatise on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "the idea is the following : ( i ) every quantum measurement yielding the data `` yes '' or `` no '' to an experimental question is described by the projection operators @xmath0 ( for `` yes '' ) or @xmath1 ( for `` no '' ) , @xmath2 ( ii ) if the initial state of a quantum object _ before _",
    "a measurement is @xmath3 , and if the measurement yields the experimental answer `` yes '' to a question @xmath4 , then the state of the quantum object _",
    "after _ the measurement @xmath5 is constructed according to the _ collapse _ of the quantum state rule @xmath6 eq.(2 ) is part of a calculation scheme which is _ not _ a unitary development of the quantum state _ during a measurement_. the unitary behavior ( implicit in the schrdinger equation for a quantum object ) was thought by von neumann to hold only _ between measurements_@xcite .    to see how this works ,",
    "consider a beam of photons which has passed through an `` upwards '' polarizer as in figs.1(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "if a second polarizer has an axis at an angle of @xmath7 with respect to the upward direction , then one writes the photon wave function @xmath8 in the basis @xmath9 the probability to pass through the second polarizer is then @xmath10    the cases shown in fig.1 below work as follows : in fig.1(a ) , the second polarizer is set orthogonal to the first polarizer so that no photons will pass ; i.e. @xmath11 this probability can be increased , as in fig.1(b ) below , by placing an intermediate polarizer between the first and last orthogonal polarizers .    in fig.1(b ) , a fraction @xmath12 of the @xmath8 photon beam will pass through the intermediate polarizer and _ collapse into the state @xmath13_. then , a fraction @xmath14 of the @xmath13 photon beam will pass through the final polarizer and again _ collapse into the state @xmath15_. the above two _ collapse of the quantum state processes _ dictate that one multiply probabilities .",
    "the final probability that a photon in the upward polarized beam passes through both the intermediate and final polarizers is then given by @xmath16 that an intermediate measurement can _ increase _ the probability of passing through a polarizer stack , say @xmath17 , is an example of what is thought to be a quantum zeno effect @xcite    a textbook quantum zeno effect problem in quantum mechanics@xcite is shown in fig.2 .",
    "a beam of photons in state @xmath8 is incident on a stack of @xmath18 polarizers each of which has a polarization axis rotated by an angle of @xmath19 relative to the previous polarizer . according to the von neumann projection postulate@xcite , the quantum state of each photon will _ collapse _ @xmath18 times , yielding a probability @xmath20 of passing through the total stack as pictured in fig.2 .",
    "note , in the formal limit of an _ infinite number of quantum state collapse events _ , @xmath21 theoretically _ every photon passes through the stack_. in real experiments , there is always some attenuation of a photon beam passing through many polarizers .",
    "although the large @xmath18 quantum zeno effect does appear to be verified in the laboratory@xcite , we have _ a very uneasy feeling _ about attributing such observations to the rule of _ collapsing quantum states_. after all , long before von neumann considered projective measurements , maxwell had developed a reliable electromagnetic radiation theory which perfectly well determined how an electromagnetic wave will ( or will not ) pass through stacks of polarizers . _ and not even once _ did maxwell feel obliged to discuss the collapse of the electromagnetic radiation field functions . for that matter ,",
    "neither bohr nor einstein@xcite had _ ever _ felt obliged to discuss the so - called wave function collapse .",
    "our purpose is to discuss why the projection postulate ( collapse of the quantum state ) , _ certainly may and probably should _ be eliminated from ones thinking in quantum mechanics . the application of this view towards photon polarization measurements is typical of a more general state of affairs .",
    "if one returns to the original copenhagen interpretation of the quantum mechanical formalism , then the quantum state describes an _ ensemble of experiments_. each photon certainly does _ not _ carry its own wave function which might then undergo a collapse whenever a photon disappears ( e.g. whenever a photon is absorbed in a polarizer ) . the wave function ( in reality ) _ describes an ensemble _ of many photons .",
    "the collapse of the quantum state whenever a photon is absorbed closely resembles the collapse of a probability table ( at the automobile insurance company ) every time a car crashes .",
    "actually , the probability table at the insurance company stays intact during a car crash .",
    "it is the _ automobile _ and _ not _ the probability that collapses .",
    "this constitutes an altogether _ different _ pile of scrap metal , even if the cross section for two automobiles to scatter off one another were computed with a quantum mechanical amplitudes to include the small diffraction effects .    in sec.ii",
    ", it will be shown how the schrdinger equation for photons in the vacuum is equivalent to the vacuum maxwell field equations . in sec.iii , the schrdinger equation for photons propagating in continuous media ( e.g. polarizers ) will be explored .",
    "the photon wave function follows from the maxwell electromagnetic theory in continuous media . however , the electromagnetic wave attenuates if the continuous media exhibits dissipation in the form of finite conductivity .",
    "the complete quantum system ( polarizers plus photons ) obeys _ a big monster _",
    "schrdinger equation with a huge number of degrees of freedom and _ does not at all require the projective measurement _ formalism of eq.(2 ) .",
    "this feature of quantum mechanics is valid for many systems as will be discussed in sec.iv .    in sec.v",
    "we compute , _ for a realistic model of polarizers _ , the maxwell equation formulation of the zeno effect .",
    "the _ classical maxwell wave _ computation ( without projection operators ) yields the same result as _ the quantum photon schrdinger amplitude _",
    "( without projection operators ) .    in an appropriate regime",
    ", the projection postulate does indeed give an accurate answer , but this may only be proved by solving the full maxwell theory without the projection postulate .",
    "one might be led to ask why should one _ ever _ add to the quantum theory a projection theory of measurements . a hint as to why the projection postulate is so popular",
    "might be connected to the fact that the maxwell theory computation ( to be presented ) required a fast computer .",
    "more than mere speed , we required algorithms sufficient to maintain @xmath22 significant figure accuracy during the entire calculation of the photon transmission probability . without recently developed precise numerical algorithms , one might be coerced into employing the projection postulate .    in the concluding sec.vi , we question the utility of replacing the wisdom of experimentalists and engineers who design and build laboratory equipment with a _ merely _ philosophical view of projective measurements .",
    "it is somewhat unreasonable to represent real laboratory equipment with mathematical projection operators .",
    "for a spin @xmath23 particle@xcite one requires three hermitian matrices @xmath24 obeying @xmath25=i\\epsilon_{ijk}s_k , \\ \\",
    "s_1 ^ 2+s_2 ^ 2+s_3 ^ 2=s(s+1).\\ ] ] the photon is a spin one ( @xmath26 ) particle so we may choose the spin matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 , the vacuum schrdinger equation for free photons reads @xmath30 writing @xmath31 allows one to cast the photon schrdinger eq.(12 ) into the ( perhaps ) more simple vector form @xmath32 the vector field @xmath33 should be constrained to obey @xmath34 eq.(15 ) is equivalent to only allowing two independent spin states ( say superpositions of only two transverse polarizations ) , thereby _ eliminating _ a third ( longitudinal polarized ) `` zero energy '' mode .",
    "finally , eqs.(14 ) and ( 15 ) take on a clearly recognizable form if one defines the real and imaginary parts of @xmath33 to be , respectively , the electric field @xmath35 and",
    "the magnetic field @xmath36@xcite@xcite@xcite ; i.e. @xmath37 the photon schrdinger eq.(12 ) then appears equivalent to the vacuum maxwell theory ; i.e. @xmath38 and @xmath39 with the vacuum gauss law eq.(15 ) constraints @xmath40    it is of interest to discuss the relativistic lorentz symmetry of the photon schrdinger eq.(12 ) .",
    "the proof of lorentz symmetry is actually well known since we have already proved equivalence with the maxwell theory .",
    "however , the discrete lorentz symmetries are still worthy of further discussion@xcite .",
    "if we consider the classical lorentz force on a charge equation @xmath41 , and then allow the charge to change sign @xmath42 , then the force @xmath43 will remain the same if we also allow @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the electromagnetic field eq.(16 ) is odd under charge conjugation , @xmath46 under time reversal , @xmath47 and @xmath45 so that @xmath48 finally , under parity @xmath44 and @xmath49 so that @xmath50 note @xmath51 as would be expected from relativistic wave equations .",
    "the maxwell theory for an electromagnetic disturbance moving through continuous media@xcite may be formulated starting from @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xmath54 it is sufficiently general to supplement eqs.(24 ) , ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) by employing a linear causal relationship between the current and the electric field , i.e. @xmath55 if , for a complex frequency @xmath56 where @xmath57 ,",
    "@xmath58 @xmath59 eqs.(27 ) , ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) serve to define the non - local conductivity @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 where @xmath62 some workers prefer to complete the maxwell equations in continuous media by employing a constitutive equation relating the maxwell displacement field @xmath63 to the electric field @xmath35 . in the frequency domain ,",
    "the dielectric response @xmath64 of the continuous media is defined as @xmath65 just so long as the various response functions are maintained as non - local ( in space and time ) , which of the many equivalent response functions are actually used in a calculation remains a matter of convenience .",
    "for example , eqs.(30 ) and ( 32 ) are equivalent if we choose @xmath66    the dielectric , magnetic , or conductivity response functions conventionally used to describe continuous media now make an appearance into the schrdinger equation for a photon moving through the continuous media via the photon `` self - energy '' insertion . to see what is involved ,",
    "we may write the maxwell eqs.(24 ) and ( 25 ) as @xmath67 and @xmath68 where eq.(16 ) has been invoked .",
    "employing eqs.(21 ) , ( 27 ) and ( 35 ) , we find our central result for the photon schrdinger equation in continuous media @xmath69 @xmath70 where the photon self - energy part is defined as @xmath71 using eqs.(13 ) and ( 36 ) , one may write the photon schrdinger equation in the form @xmath72 @xmath73    in principle the calculation of the self energy part @xmath74 is equivalent to the calculation of the conductivity @xmath60 as is evident from eqs.(21 ) , ( 31 ) , and ( 37 ) . in a practical calculations involving the photon schrdinger equation in a polarizer",
    ", one should use the conductivity and dielectric response functions as those of the optical engineers who designed the device@xcite .",
    "finally , the non - local form of eq.(38 ) is shared by many other quantum mechanical systems as we shall now briefly explore .",
    "although we do not adhere to the non - unitary collapse of the quantum state eq.(2 ) as postulated by von neumann , we do find the notion of projection operators ( also introduced into quantum mechanics by von neumann ) to be more than just convenient .",
    "eq.(1 ) will thereby be invoked in what follows . for a macroscopic laboratory quantum system",
    "we here insist that a _ monster _ schrdinger equation with a huge number of degrees of freedom still holds true , @xmath75 we do not contemplate the _ ultimate monster wave function _ of the _ whole universe _",
    ", not only because we are not smart enough to find it , but because we do not know how to build an experimental _ ensemble of universes _ to test a hypothetical quantum state of _ our universe_. we leave such considerations to people more wise than are we .",
    "we are happy to say something meaningful about a very small physical piece of a laboratory quantum state ; e.g. a `` projected piece '' @xmath76 we leave the rest of the monster wave function , @xmath77 to the engineers who design the experiment . with the little piece of the wave function eq.(40 ) and the big piece of the wave function eq.(41 ) , we rewrite eq.(39 ) as @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we can only hope to find @xmath83 which obeys @xmath84 so we solve for the monster piece @xmath85 subject to the causal boundary condition @xmath86    from eqs.(43 ) and ( 45 ) we find the general non - local schrdinger equation for the piece of the wave function that is of interest ; it is @xmath87 where @xmath88    the full monster schrdinger eq.(39 ) for complete wave function @xmath89 reduces to the non - local in time schrdinger eq.(46 ) for the small subspace piece of the wave function @xmath90 .",
    "a particular example of eq.(46 ) is the photon schrdinger eq.(38 ) .",
    "the point is that when a photon propagates inside of a continuous media device , say a polarizer , the _ monster wave function _",
    "includes _ both _ the photon _ and _ the polarizer degrees of freedom . in a one photon projected subspace ,",
    "the quantum state of the polarizer is fixed .",
    "in addition to the polarizer , there is but one propagating photon .",
    "if the photon is absorbed , then an electronic excitation is produced which heats up the polarizer .",
    "the piece of the monster quantum state representing this absorbed photon situation is not contained in the single photon subspace .",
    "the single photon subspace wave function is then attenuated due to photon absorption in the polarizer .",
    "all of this ( including the attenuation of the maxwell wave in the medium ) is described by the one photon schrdinger equation , _ without _ recourse to the projection postulate .",
    "maxwell was so lucky to be able to write down the schrdinger equation for the photon in matter , including attenuation , _ without _ knowing anything about quantum states ( be they monster or otherwise ) .",
    "it is of interest to look for a fixed energy solution of the subspace wave function eq.(46 ) of the form @xmath91 eqs.(46 ) , ( 47 ) and ( 48 ) imply @xmath92 where @xmath93 that the effective energy dependent hamiltonian on the left hand side of eq.(49 ) @xmath94 is not hermitian , is due to the `` fermi platinum rule '' transition rates to leave the small subspace and wander into the remaining monster subspaces .",
    "the fermi platinum rule @xmath95 is just a little bit more valuable than the more usual perturbative fermi golden rule , since eq.(52 ) is rigorously true to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "the fixed energy @xmath96 case corresponds to having a fixed photon frequency @xmath97 for the electromagnetic problem at hand .",
    "let us return to this problem .",
    "the maxwell theory of a transverse wave moving through a polarizer may be formulated following the discussion of born and wolf@xcite .",
    "( i ) if a transverse wave propagates in the @xmath98-direction , then the wave may be described by four electromagnetic field components , say @xmath99 if the polarizer is oriented by a rotation angle @xmath7 , as in fig.1(b ) , then the dielectric response tensor will have the form @xmath100 where we have employed the @xmath101 pauli matrices @xmath102 and @xmath103 the complex principal eigenvalues of the dielectric tensor at frequency @xmath104 have the form @xmath105 the real parts of the dielectric eigenvalues @xmath106 determine the velocities of the waves polarized in the principal directions . the conductivities @xmath107 determine the dissipative attenuation of the waves polarized in the principle directions .",
    "for a well designed polarizer , a wave with an allowed polarization direction will propagate unattenuated while a wave with a disallowed polarization will be strongly attenuated .",
    "_ it is the anisotropic dissipative conductivity that is often modeled by the quantum projective postulate for the case of photon polarization_. on the other hand , conductivity is evidently _ classical _ since both ohm and maxwell were dead and gone _ before _ quantum mechanics had been invented .    for the classical maxwell calculation ,",
    "the wave at the beginning @xmath108 of the polarizer is related to the wave at the end @xmath109 of the polarizer by a @xmath110 transfer matrix @xmath111 @xmath112 is defined in eq.(53 ) , and in partitioned matrix form @xmath113 @xmath114 for a stack of @xmath18 polarizers , each of width @xmath115 and oriented at angles @xmath116 , one may repeat the above process going from the beginning @xmath108 of the stack to the end @xmath117 of the stack @xmath118 one multiplies the transfer matrices for each polarizer in the stack @xmath119    once the total @xmath110 transfer matrix is computed , one may find the transmission amplitudes @xmath120 and reflection amplitudes @xmath121 for the two polarization directions @xmath122 by solving the linear algebra problem @xmath123 for an incident photon in the allowed @xmath124-polarization direction , the probability that the photon exits a stack of @xmath18 polarizers ( rotated into the allowed @xmath125-polarization direction ) is given by the absolute square of the transmission amplitude , @xmath126 from eqs.(54 ) , ( 59 ) , and ( 61)-(63 ) , with each of the angles in @xmath116 set equal to @xmath127 , one may compare the the projection postulate @xmath128 in eq.(7 ) to the maxwell theory , or equivalently the photon schrdinger eq.(63 ) , without the projection postulate .",
    "the matrix multiplications in eq.(61 ) and the linear algebra in eq.(62 ) are best left to a computer .",
    "the results of such a computation are shown in fig.3 .",
    "the solid curve in fig.3 is the prediction of the projection postulate eq.(7 ) . for the maxwell theory with a reasonable stack of laboratory polarizers",
    ", there may be @xmath129 wavelengths of light in each polarizer in the stack .",
    "thus we chose the parameter @xmath130 for purpose of illustration .",
    "we further choose @xmath131 to describe the polarization direction for which the polarizer would be transparent and the complex @xmath132 to describe the polarization direction for which the polarizer would be strongly attenuated ( if not absolutely opaque ) .",
    "the resulting computed points are the filled circles of fig.3 . for this case ,",
    "the projection postulate yields a @xmath128 which is quite close to the full maxwell theory .    for some regimes ( perhaps more close to the laboratory situation ) , the maxwell theory begins to diverge from from the projection postulate for large @xmath18 . in the laboratory",
    "all polarization directions are subject to small ( but certainly finite ) attenuation .",
    "to test this situation , we computed the maxwell theory prediction when the allowed polarization has a weak attenuation response @xmath133 while the disallowed polarization has a stronger attenuation response @xmath134 .",
    "the results are the filled squares of fig.3 . for @xmath135",
    ", there is a zeno effect in which @xmath128 increases .",
    "however for @xmath136 , the is an attenuation induced decrease in @xmath128 , contrary to the `` zeno effect expectation '' .",
    "however , one might regard this attenuation of the allowed polarization direction to be merely an indication of poor experimental design .",
    "some final comments about the calculations producing fig.3 are worthy of note . the transfer matrix formalism used to calculate the transmission probability @xmath128 was tedious , but straight forward .",
    "however , the numerical computations required to produce fig.3 were not entirely trivial .",
    "the first three numerical commercial software programs that we employed for the calculation produced complete nonsense@xcite .",
    "the physical problem was that the maxwell waves reflect back and forth within the polarizers .",
    "hence , there exist _ exponentially attenuated _ terms as well as _ exponentially amplified _ terms in the transfer matrix .",
    "high accuracy was needed for the matrix multiplications in eq.(61 ) . only with high accuracy at intermediate stages of the calculation , could eqs.(62 ) and ( 63 ) be reliably computed . for realistic laboratory polarizers ,",
    "the required accuracy turns out to be very high indeed .",
    "fortunately , aberth@xcite has developed precise numerical algorithms together with publicly available programming code which allows for @xmath137 significant figure accurate computations .",
    "much of the required code for the standard functions and standard linear algebra was thus available .",
    "we used this code .",
    "however , we required @xmath22 significant figure computations to produce the reliable plots shown in fig.3 .",
    "in discussions of the foundations of quantum mechanics there has been a tendency to regard all interference of waves as explicitly due to quantum mechanics .",
    "this is only sometimes true , since `` waves '' as well as `` particles '' also have classical limits . in many ( perhaps most ) of the electromagnetic experiments and applications ,",
    "the maxwell wave itself is classical .",
    "the _ distinction _ between a classical wave , a classical particle , and a quantum particle has been discussed simply , _ yet clearly _ , by feynman@xcite .",
    "\\(i ) a quantum particle is _ certainly not _ a classical particle .",
    "quantum particle dynamics dictates amplitude superposition , whereas classical dynamics dictates probability superposition .",
    "( ii ) a quantum particle is _ certainly not _ a classical wave .",
    "a classical wave is `` smooth '' while a quantum particle comes in `` lumps '' .",
    "photons are lumpy . photon counters yield one click whenever a photon is detected .",

    "the photon is _ certainly not _ a classical wave .",
    "the photon is _ certainly not _ a classical particle .",
    "the photon is _ certainly not _ a little bit classical wave and a little bit classical particle .",
    "( iii ) the photon is _ neither _ a classical wave _ nor _ a classical particle _ nor _ a little bit of both .    electromagnetic waves ,",
    "as described by maxwell , are classical waves .",
    "if a radio station broadcasts a signal , then the signal is ( for all practical purposes ) smooth .",
    "your radio gets some of the signal , and our radio gets some of the signal .",
    "there is enough smoothly distributed classical wave to go around to all of the radios .",
    "the classical maxwell wave is smooth .",
    "one detector can not get a fraction of a photon .",
    "remember , photons come in lumps .",
    "one photon can get destroyed in at most one radio receiver .",
    "one detector can get any fraction of a classical maxwell wave .",
    "remember , classical waves are smooth . yet",
    "the schrdinger equation for photon is the same ( in a mathematical formalism ) as the maxwell equations for classical electromagnetic waves .",
    "this is because the photon has no mass and because the photon is a boson .",
    "when very many photons are bose condensed into a single quantum state , the result is a maxwell wave which is classical for all practical purposes .",
    "the above picture was not all that clear to einstein ( by his own admission ) , and we do not claim to know more about photons than did einstein . according to einstein , a maxwell wave hits a half silvered mirror and some of the wave goes to one detector and the rest of the wave goes to a second detector .",
    "if the wave represents one photon , then only one counter goes click .",
    "the other counter gets whacked with a maxwell wave .",
    "yet this counter counts nothing .",
    "when there is but one photon , only one counter can speak for her .",
    "some maxwell wave parts turn out to have have a photon , and some maxwell wave parts turn out not have a photon .",
    "some counters go click and some counters remain mute . you never know . and photons are lumpy .",
    "it is a very strange shell game according to einstein@xcite .",
    "however , the zeno effect formally attributed to the quantum mechanical projection postulate has here been argued to be merely a classical wave effect .",
    "maxwell would not have had to increase his knowledge of electromagnetic theory by even one iota in order to totally understand the polarization version of the zeno effect .",
