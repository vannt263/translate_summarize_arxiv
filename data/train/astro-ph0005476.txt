    "it has been known for several years that the standard cold dark matter model , ( scdm , @xmath0 ) refers to the fraction of critical energy density present in component @xmath1 ; @xmath2 represents all forms of matter , @xmath3 signifies massive neutrinos , and  stands for the cosmological constant .",
    "hubble s constant is given by @xmath4km / s / mpc .",
    "@xmath5 refers to the power - law index of the primordial power spectrum . ]",
    "could not simultaneously agree with cobe and large - scale structure observations .",
    "viable alternatives included tilted cold dark matter ( tcdm , @xmath6 ) , cold + hot dark matter ( chdm , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , open cold dark matter ( ocdm , @xmath9 ) , and cdm ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "gawiser & silk@xcite performed a quantitative comparison of these models with a compilation of cmb anisotropy and large - scale structure data and found that chdm was the most successful model .",
    "cdm , ocdm , and tcdm were inconsistent with the data at 99% confidence .",
    "the discrimination between models came primarily from large - scale structure data , particularly the apm galaxy power spectrum , and different values of the shape parameter ( @xmath12 = @xmath13 in @xmath14 cdm models ) were preferred on large and small scales .",
    "despite the recent success of chdm , @xmath7 is not viable given current measurements of the cluster baryon fraction  @xcite and the abundance of baryons inferred from measurements of deuterium in lyman limit systems  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the high abundance of massive clusters at @xmath15 can only be reconciled with @xmath7 in the case of non - gaussian primordial density fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the overwhelming current evidence for a low matter density leaves us with only two of the previous models , cdm and ocdm .",
    "the redshift - luminosity distance relationship observed for type ia supernovae data prefers cdm to ocdm at better than 99% confidence  @xcite , leaving us with a clear favorite of these `` direct '' cosmological tests and promoting cdm to the status of the `` standard model '' of cosmology .",
    "should we be concerned that the same cdm model was ruled out by @xcite at 99% confidence ? certainly .",
    "however , given the history of systematic errors in astronomy it may well turn out that one or more of the aforementioned observations is flawed .",
    "given the confluence of evidence for a low value of @xmath16 , the most likely culprit would be the observations of large - scale structure that drove the analysis of @xcite to favor chdm .",
    "the strongest discriminator was the real - space galaxy power spectrum inferred from the apm galaxy angular correlation function , and this has recently been carefully re - analyzed by eisenstein & zaldarriaga  @xcite .",
    "they find increased uncertainties on large spatial scales , and adopting their re - analysis leads to significant improvement in the agreement of cdm and ocdm with large - scale structure observations .",
    "however , this agreement remains imperfect ; chdm is still preferred by large - scale structure data but less significantly .",
    "this stands in marked contrast to a _ myth _ propagated by some cosmologists that large - scale structure provides independent evidence in favor of cdm .",
    "this myth appears to be caused by remembering that cdm was preferred to standard cdm by large - scale structure observations , knowing that cdm has now been promoted to `` standard model , '' and concluding that cdm must be favored by large - scale structure data over all other models .",
    "this is not correct .",
    "our large - scale structure data compilation includes the real - space galaxy power spectrum derived from the apm angular correlation function by @xcite and redshift - space power spectra from ssrs2+cfa2  @xcite , lcrs  @xcite , pscz  @xcite , and apm clusters  @xcite .",
    "we also use measurements of the amplitude of the dark matter power spectrum at 8@xmath17mpc ( @xmath18 ) from the abundance of rich galaxy clusters at @xmath19  @xcite and @xmath20  @xcite and at larger scales from peculiar velocity fields  @xcite .",
    "figure [ lss_lchdm_all ] shows our data compilation versus the predictions for the matter power spectrum from the cdm model and two versions of chdm with massive neutrinos generating @xmath21 , one of which has a tilted ( @xmath22 ) primordial power spectrum . for quantitative results , we corrected for scale - independent galaxy bias , redshift distortions and non - linear evolution in the manner described by @xcite , but those corrections are not shown here .",
    "uncertainty in those corrections on non - linear scales at @xmath23 leads us to restrict our analysis to larger scales .     and @xmath24 ( dotted ) , and chdm with @xmath25 and @xmath22 ( dashed ) . ]",
    "since the agreement between cdm and the large - scale structure data is less than perfect , we investigate whether adding hot dark matter will improve the fit ( for a fuller discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "the opposite occurs ; fig .",
    "[ lss_lchdm_all ] shows that the chdm model with @xmath26 is in serious disagreement with our large - scale structure data .",
    "the diffusion of relativistic neutrinos in the early universe predicts a level of small - scale perturbations significantly lower than that observed .",
    "however , tilting the primordial power spectrum to @xmath22 essentially resolves this problem . for large - scale structure data alone , this illustrates a degeneracy between the possibility of neutrino mass and the uncertain nature of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "using all available cmb anisotropy data as well as our large - scale structure data compilation helps to differentiate between variations in the primordial power spectrum and the reduction in small - scale power caused by massive neutrinos .",
    "figure [ dt_lchdm ] illustrates the complementary nature of cmb anisotropy data .",
    "the open cdm model is ruled out by the location of the first peak caused by acoustic oscillations , which instead indicates a flat geometry for the universe .",
    "the chdm model with @xmath22 predicts too much anisotropy at high multipoles ( small angles ) , whereas the presence of massive neutrinos is indistinguishable for @xmath14 .",
    "thus the version of chdm that agreed well with large - scale structure data is ruled out by the cmb , and vice versa .",
    "we have assumed either a harrison - zeldovich ( scale - invariant , @xmath27 ) or a scale - free ( @xmath28 ) primordial power spectrum .",
    "if cdm is right and @xmath14 , then @xmath29 , and @xmath30  ev . if @xmath5 can vary , @xmath31 , and @xmath32  ev ( limits are at 95% confidence ) .",
    "more freedom in the primordial power spectrum makes it nearly impossible to limit the neutrino mass .",
    "interesting physics can be probed by large - scale structure with forthcoming data from the 2-degree field survey ( 2df ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the location of the peak in the matter power spectrum identifies the horizon size at matter - radiation equality ( @xmath33 ) , and for pure cdm models this provides an independent measurement of @xmath34 @xmath13 .",
    "large - scale structure data at @xmath350.10.2 probe the primordial power spectrum on smaller scales than can be measured well with cmb anisotropy data before planck ; this provides a much - needed _ test of inflation_. as discussed by hu , eisenstein , & tegmark  @xcite , the method utilized here can hope to measure ( or constrain ) neutrino masses down to 0.5 ev given data from the map satellite and sdss .",
    "cdm is now the standard cosmological model but large - scale structure data does not prefer it over chdm or ocdm .",
    "current large - scale structure data can not rule out any of those models at 95% confidence .",
    "cdm does not prefer the addition of a hot dark matter component in the form of massive neutrinos .",
    "this leads to an upper limit on the mass of the most massive neutrino of 4  ev if a power - law primordial power spectrum is assumed ."
