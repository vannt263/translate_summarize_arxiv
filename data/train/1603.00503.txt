    "it is easy to see that the derivative of any affine homeomorphism of @xmath1 is constant , hence we have a well defined map @xmath3 the main purpose of this article is the study of the image @xmath4 of this map .",

    "veech proved the geodesic flow on a compact translation surface @xmath1 for which @xmath4 is a lattice behaves , roughly speaking , like the geodesic flow on a flat torus .",
    "for this reason it is usual to call @xmath4 _ the veech group _ of the surface @xmath1 . aside from questions regarding the dynamical properties of the geodesic flow ,",
    "it is natural to investigate which subgroups of @xmath7 can be realised as veech groups . for compact translation surfaces ,",
    "this is a difficult question .",
    "moreover , simpler instances of this problem , as the existence of hyperbolic cyclic veech groups , are still open .    in this paper",
    "we address the aforementioned realisation problem from the perspective of _ infinite type _ tame translation surfaces .",
    "this kind of translation surfaces appears naturally when studying irrational polygonal billiards @xcite or infinite coverings of compact translation surfaces @xcite .",
    "given that translation surfaces are orientable , the topological type of an infinite type translation surface is determined by its genus @xmath8 and a couple of nested compact , metrisable and totally disconnected spaces @xmath9 . here @xmath10 is the space of ends of @xmath1 and @xmath11 is formed by those ends that carry ( infinite ) genus .",
    "reciprocally , every couple of nested closed subspaces of the cantor set @xmath12 can be realised as the space of ends and the space of ends with genus of some surface .",
    "the following result describes in general terms what is to be expected from the veech group of a tame translation surface .",
    "@xcite [ t : psv1 ] the veech group @xmath4 of a tame translation surface is either :    1 .",
    "countable and does not contain contracting elements , or 2 .   conjugated to @xmath13 3 .",
    "conjugated to @xmath14 , the subgroup generated by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , or 4 .",
    "equal to @xmath17 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that condition 4 above implies that @xmath1 is isometric to either the plane or a ramified covering of the plane .",

    "let @xmath18 be a nested couple of closed subspaces of the cantor set .",
    "is it possible to realise any subgroup of @xmath7 satisfying ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , or ( 3 ) in theorem [ t : psv1 ] as the veech group of some _ tame _ translation surface @xmath1 satisfying @xmath19 and @xmath20 ?    for the simplest instance of this question @xmath21",
    "the answer is positive :    _ ( ibid . ) _ [ t : psv2 ] any subgroup of @xmath17 satisfying ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , or ( 3 ) in theorem [ t : psv1 ] can be realised as the veech group of an infinite genus tame translation with only one end .",
    "the main contribution of this article is to show that question [ q:1 ] has a positive answer for a large topological class of infinite type tame translation surfaces .",
    "for instance , in  [ sec : uncountableveech ] we show that within the topological class of infinite type tame translation surfaces @xmath1 for which @xmath22 , there are no restrictions to realise _ uncountable _ veech groups :    [ t : pp ] let @xmath23 be any closed subset of the cantor set and @xmath24 be as in theorem [ t : psv1 ] . then there exist tame translation surfaces @xmath1 and @xmath25 for which :    * @xmath26 * the veech groups of @xmath1 and @xmath27 are conjugated to @xmath15 and @xmath28 , respectively .",

    "we present them according to the following heuristic picture : if one was to order infinite genus surfaces satisfying @xmath22 according to their topological complexity , the simplest surface would be the one for which the space of ends is just a singleton and the most sophisticated would be the one for which the space of ends is homeomorphic to the cantor set .",
