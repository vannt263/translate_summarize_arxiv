    "during the past 15 years plenty of progress has been made in understanding _ cpt_- and lorentz violation and its possible implications on physics from both a theoretical and a phenomenological point of view .",
    "this was made possible by establishing the standard - model extension ( sme ) in 1998 @xcite and by the subsequent tireless work of people in our community eager to study imprints of planck - scale physics detectable by experiments operating at much smaller energies .",
    "the sme is a powerful framework incorporating all lorentz - violating operators into the standard model of elementary particles and general relativity .",
    "it neither modifies the gauge structure of the standard model nor does it introduce new particles .",
    "the power - counting renormalizable contributions of the sme are grouped into its minimal part where the remaining higher - order operators comprise the nonminimal sme @xcite .",
    "this framework allows for astounding experimental tests of lorentz invariance where even presently some experiments reach a sensitivity of the planck scale square ( see @xcite for a yearly updated compilation of experimental contraints on lorentz - violating coefficients ) . since lorentz violation implies _",
    "cpt_-violation according to a theorem by greenberg @xcite , the standard - model extension involves all _ cpt_-odd operators as a subset .",
    "note that lorentz violation has been predicted by various prototypes of fundamental theories such as string theory @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite , noncommutative spacetime @xcite , spacetime foam @xcite , and models with nontrivial spacetime topology @xcite .",
    "in the recent past profound studies of modified quantum field theories based on the sme were performed at tree - level and including quantum corrections .",
    "the result of these studies is that most sectors are free of any inconsistencies @xcite .",
    "furthermore the sme was explicitly shown to be renormalizable at one loop @xcite where latest computations have demonstrated renormalizability of the modified quantum electrodynamics @xcite and the pure yang - mills sector @xcite at infinite - loop order using algebraic techniques .",
    "therefore as long as the sme is restricted to minkowski spacetime , it seems to be a reasonable , well - behaved , and model - independent test framework for planck - scale physics .",
    "the gravitational sector of the sme was constructed in the seminal article @xcite . in the aftermath",
    ", studies on its theory and phenomenology were performed in a successive series of papers @xcite with recent investigations of even nonminimal operators in short - range gravity tests @xcite .",
    "one of the most important theoretical results of @xcite is a no - go theorem stating that explicit lorentz violation is incompatible with the geometric framework of general relativity , which is riemannian geometry .",
    "considering lorentz - violating matter in a gravitational background results in modified conservation laws of the energy - momentum tensor based on noether s theorem .",
    "however lorentz violation does _ a priori _ not modify the geometrical base such as the bianchi identities of the riemann curvature tensor . due to the einstein equations the second bianchi identity",
    "is tightly bound to the conservation of energy - momentum , which is then incommensurate with the modified matter sector .",
    "a possibility of circumventing this clash is to perform phenomenological studies in theories resting on spontaneous lorentz violation .",
    "this means that a lorentz - violating background field arises dynamically as the vacuum expectation value of a vector or tensor field .",
    "such models have been studied since the early 1990s @xcite ( even before the sme existed ) and they can be considered as one of the motivations that lead to the construction of the sme . the crucial point within models of spontaneous lorentz violation is to take into account the nambu - goldstone modes that are linked to the symmetry breaking .",
    "this can lead to arduous perturbative calculations within such a theory .    for these reasons it would be preferable to have a setup available that allows for incorporating explicit lorentz violation into a curved background without possible tensions with the underlying geometrical properties .",
    "a suggestion was already given in @xcite along the same lines as the no - go theorem : introducing an alternative geometrical framework that can include preferred directions naturally .",
    "such an extension of riemannian geometry has been known in the mathematics community for almost 100 years .",
    "it is named finsler geometry in reference to the famous mathematician finsler who studied generalized path length functionals in his ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive mathematical overview on the subject ) .",
    "finsler geometry has been applied to various fields of physics @xcite . in the context of the standard - model extension it found its use just a couple of years ago when it was shown that the minimal lorentz - violating fermion sector can be mapped to classical - particle descriptions @xcite .",
    "the corresponding lagrange functions are closely linked to finsler structures , i.e. , generalized path length functionals . recently a nonminimal case was studied @xcite as well as classical - particle trajectories in electromagnetic fields and modified spin precession based on an isotropic set of minimal fermion coefficients @xcite . in @xcite a particular class of finsler spaces known as bipartite",
    "is investigated closer from a physics point of view and @xcite suggests classical - mechanics systems that are linked to three - dimensional versions of finsler @xmath0 space @xcite . in a very recent paper @xcite @xmath0 space",
    "is discussed from a mathematical point of view .",
    "its indicatrix ( surface of constant value of the finsler structure ) is a two - valued deformation from a sphere that is characterized by singularities with ambiguous derivatives .",
    "considering the indicatrix as an algebraic variety , the hironaka theorem says that such singularities can be removed @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a coordinate transformation was found , which allows to remove the singular sets and to glue the remaining parts together appropriately .",
    "this results in a well - defined mathematical description of @xmath0 space that can be used for future physical investigations .",
    "the goals of the current article are threefold .",
    "first , analogous classical equivalents for the minimal _ cpt_-even photon sector of the sme shall be found .",
    "second , with these equivalents at hand we intend to study phenomenological aspects of lorentz - violating photons in weak gravitational fields .",
    "last but not least we would like to understand various consequences of this approach on the base of finsler geometry .",
    "the procedures to be developed will differ extensively from the sme fermion counterparts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the lorentz - violating framework , which all investigations are based on ,",
    "is introduced .",
    "a brief review on finsler geometry and finsler structures in the sme fermion sector is given in , followed by an explanation of the method to constructing finsler structures in the photon sector . in that section",
    "we investigate different cases that are the most interesting ones from a physics point of view . in the geometric - optics approximation photons",
    "are described by the eikonal equation , which forms the cornerstone of .",
    "it is demonstrated how the finsler structures obtained are linked to the eikonal equation for the different sectors analyzed in the previous section .",
    "since the isotropic modification of the _ cpt_-even sector can be considered to be the most important one , all forthcoming studies will be based on the latter .",
    "section [ sec : gravitational - backgrounds ] is dedicated to investigating the isotropic eikonal equation in a weak gravitational background .",
    "we develop a phenomenological framework to study light bending at massive bodies within such a theory . in this context prospects",
    "are given on detecting isotropic lorentz violation of photons propagating in a gravitational background .",
    "this is carried out for two space - based missions : gaia and lator .",
    "the final part of the paper is more theoretical . in the modified conservation law of the energy - momentum tensor",
    "is investigated , interpreting the results from the point of view of explicit versus spontaneous lorentz violation .",

    "it was demonstrated that certain birefringent cases of modified maxwell theory require a nonvanishing photon mass ( at least in intermediate calculations ) to have a consistent gupta - bleuler quantization .",
    "finally , a gauge fixing term will be omitted in the action , since all considerations will be carried out at the classical level .      the major goal is to understand how lorentz - violating photons can be described in the context of gravity .",
    "since einstein s relativity is a classical theory , it is reasonable to obtain a classical analogue of the quantum field theory based on the action of .",
    "with such an analogue at hand it should be possible to study how an explicitly lorentz - violating theory of gravity could be constructed consistently . as an introduction to the topic the mapping procedure of the sme fermion sector to a classical point - particle description @xcite",

    "this is not surprising , since the starting point to obtaining the lagrange function was a field theory defined in minkowski spacetime . by a wick rotation",

    "however the standard method used for the fermion sector does not work any more in case the photon mass vanishes .",
    "the reason is that a light ray does not have as many degrees of freedom as a massive particle .    instead , for the photon sector an alternative technique had to be employed which allowed to derive a lagrangian - type function for a classical ray directly from the modified photon dispersion relation",
    "this was carried out for several interesting cases of the minimal , _",
    "cpt_-even photon sector , which is characterized by dimensionless controlling coefficients .",
    "subsequently it was shown that the results obtained are consistent with the eikonal equation approach that describes the geometric - optics limit of an electromagnetic wave .",
    "mathematically the lagrangian - type functions can be interpreted as finsler structures .",
    "in contrast to the fermion sector they only involve the spatial velocity components and they are closely linked to an effective refractive index of the lorentz - violating vacuum .",
    "it has been known long since that there is a connection between the geodesic equations for a light ray in a gravitational background and the eikonal equations .",
    "this link is warranted for weak gravitational fields at least , e.g. , in the solar system .",
    "it was crucial to set up a phenomenological description of light rays subject to lorentz violation in a weak gravitational field .",
    "this description made it possible to obtain sensitivities on the isotropic controlling coefficient @xmath80 that could be probed by the space missions gaia and lator employing measurements of light deflection at massive bodies .",
    "the upshot is that the planned mission lator may have a sensitivity on @xmath458 in the order of magnitude of @xmath470 where the running mission gaia can reach @xmath459 .",
    "the difference in sensitivity originates from the different precision of measuring angles for both missions .",
    "the final part of the paper was dedicated to investigating the properties of the ( isotropic ) curved spacetime , which the phenomenological studies were based on , from a finslerian point of view .",
    "it was demonstrated that in the classical limit ( neglecting higher spacetime derivatives of the refractive index ) an einstein tensor can be defined that is not subject to the usual bianchi identities in riemannian geometry . therefore its covariant derivative is nonzero and it has a form that is related to the modified conservation law of the energy - momentum tensor based on the classical lagrangian - type function studied in this context .",
    "hence it seems that finsler geometry provides new geometrical degrees of freedom that can serve as a kind of `` buffer '' to allow for a momentum transfer whenever the momentum of the light ray changes .",
    "these geometrical degrees of freedom take the role of the nambu - goldstone modes appearing when spontaneous lorentz violation is considered .",
    "to summarize , the current article provides a technique in treating lorentz - violating photons in a curved background in a geometric - optics approximation . as an outlook it will be interesting to apply the setup to anisotropic frameworks , first to obtain sensitivities on related controlling coefficients and second to study the properties of the underlying finsler geometry",

    "<S> the current article shall contribute to understanding the classical analogue of the minimal photon sector in the lorentz - violating standard - model extension ( sme ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is supposed to complement all studies performed on classical point - particle equivalents of sme fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the classical analogue of a photon is not a massive particle being described by a usual equation of motion , but a geometric ray underlying the eikonal equation . </S>",
    "<S> the first part of the paper will set up the necessary tools to understand this correspondence for interesting cases of the minimal sme photon sector . </S>",
    "<S> in conventional optics the eikonal equation follows from an action principle , which is demonstrated to work in most ( but not all ) lorentz - violating cases as well . </S>",
    "<S> the integrands of the action functional correspond to finsler structures , which establishes the connection to finsler geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the second part of the article treats lorentz - violating light rays in a weak gravitational background by implementing the principle of minimal coupling . </S>",
    "<S> thereby it is shown how lorentz violation in the photon sector can be constrained by measurements of light bending at massive bodies such as the sun . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological studies are based on the currently running esa mission gaia and the planned nasa / esa mission lator . </S>",
    "<S> the final part of the paper discusses certain aspects of explicit lorentz violation in gravity based on the setting of finsler geometry . </S>"
