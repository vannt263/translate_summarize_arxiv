    "according to bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory  @xcite , superconductivity requires that electrons bind in cooper pairs and condense collectively in a macroscopic quantum state . in conventional superconductors , the observation of a shift in the superconductivity transition temperature upon isotope substitution  @xcite , was an experimental breakthrough leading to the conclusion that lattice vibrations ( phonons ) act as a glue among electrons promoting the required pairing . since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates in 1986  @xcite , the observation of an analogous fingerprint of the glue involved in the pairing mechanism , if any , has been lacking .",
    "a fertile route to obtain information on excitations in solids and their coupling to electrons is pump - probe spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "typically , the sample is illuminated by an ultrashort laser pulse lasting a few tens of fs and carrying 1.5 ev photons .",
    "this `` pump '' pulse creates an out - of - equilibrium distribution of particle - hole excitations which decays to states within a few hundreds of mev of the chemical potential  @xcite in the pulse duration time scale .",
    "there , phase space restrictions slow down the dynamics  @xcite and the subsequent evolution can be studied in real time by a probe pulse .",
    "the dynamical response of the system can be observed with a temporal resolution comparable to the time scale of relevant processes in the material , like the pairs breaking , their recombination , or the electron - phonon coupling time .",
    "for example , the photoinduced quenching of the superconducting order parameter and its subsequent recovery were followed by recording the temporal evolution of the gap amplitude in the optical spectrum of different cuprates  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it was found that the energy needed to suppress the superconducting state in these materials is several times larger than the condensation energy  @xcite , in contrast to what happens in conventional superconductors where it is of the same order  @xcite .",
    "optical studies also provided insights on the relaxation dynamics of the excited quasiparticles  @xcite , and on the optical spectral weight transfers associated with the carriers kinetic energy changes across the photoinduced phase transition  @xcite .",
    "fs - angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) showed that the decay of photoexcited carriers is dominated by the recombination of the cooper pairs at the antinodes ( i.e. the copper - oxygen bond direction in real space )  @xcite . also , similar experiments yielded an estimate of the electron phonon coupling strength being in the intermediate regime  @xcite , similar to what was found by fs - electron diffraction , which in turns identified also its anisotropy  @xcite .    in all of the above - mentioned experiments ,",
    "excitation by the pump occurs through dipole allowed processes ( i.e. the corresponding matter - radiation interaction hamiltonian is linear as a function of the electric field ) and the dynamics is dominated by the incoherent relaxation of the system .",
    "however , the same pump pulse can also generate coherent oscillations of the optical properties due to the population of elementary excitations through a stimulated raman process ( i.e. through the second - order term of the matter - radiation hamiltonian , which is quadratic as a function of the electric field ) .",
    "for example , in transparent media , phonons can be excited by the impulsive stimulated raman scattering ( isrs ) mechanism  @xcite ; in absorbing media instead , both a displacive  @xcite and an isrs mechanism may enter into play depending on various factors such as the lifetime of the particle - hole excitations  @xcite , the nature of the coupling among phonons and particle - hole excitations , etc .     along the fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "the three upper panels define the pseudospins operators in momentum space : a pseudopsin down corresponds to the pair of states ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) being fully occupied ( _ a _ ) , a pseudospin up to the pair ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) being empty ( _ b _ ) , and a sideway pseudopsin to a quantum superposition of the previous two ( c ) .",

    "these coherent excitations are subsequently probed by fs - broad - band reflectivity , allowing to observe the real - time oscillations of the cooper pair condensate and its impact on high - energy excitations .",

    "the pump pulse impulsively perturbs the system and induces the pseudospins precession , i.e. the oscillations of the cooper pair condensate .",
    "the optical spectra of the system are then monitored in real time at different energies , revealing the optical transitions that respond to the oscillating condensate ; this allows to single out those excitations that can potentially mediate electron - electron interactions impacting the formation of cooper pairs .",

    "we performed such high - temporal resolution ( @xmath29  fs ) experiments in two optimally doped ( @xmath0 = 40 k ) la@xmath30sr@xmath31cuo@xmath32 ( lsco ) single crystals ( @xmath20 ) with different orientations ( see _ si text _ and ref .",

    "we chose different experimental geometries for exploiting the raman selection rules for excitation and detection to obtain information on different final states ( see _ si text _ ) .",
    "in the first geometry , the pump electric field is parallel to the cu - o bond giving access to raman excitations with @xmath10 symmetry , while the probe pulse electric field is directed towards the @xmath33-axis , allowing us to detect only @xmath34 symmetry excitations .",
