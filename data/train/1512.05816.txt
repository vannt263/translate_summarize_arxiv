    "alfvn waves have been proposed as an energy delivery mechanism for solar atmospheric processes ranging from heating of the chromosphere @xcite or corona @xcite to the acceleration of the solar wind @xcite . both observations @xcite and numerical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that there is enough alfvn wave energy generated in the convection zone to heat the chromosphere , but the mechanisms by which this wave energy is thermalized in the chromosphere , if indeed it is , remain unclear . if alfvn waves are a dominant source of quiet chromospheric heating the observed input flux of @xmath0 must be converted into a @xmath1 local heating rate to balance the energy loss in the chromosphere .",
    "estimates place the maximum heating rate required as @xmath1 dropping to @xmath2 in the upper chromosphere @xcite .",
    "the possibility that alfvn waves may heat the solar atmosphere and drive the solar wind has been studied numerically with many variations . @xcite",
    "extensively studied the 1.5d problem for circularly polarized alfvn waves in expanding flux tubes and showed the importance of coupling to slow modes , fast modes and shocks .",
    "these papers demonstrated that it was certainly possible for alfvn waves to heat the solar atmosphere and drive the solar wind .",
    "later work has extended this to white noise spectrum photospheric drivers in both 1.5d @xcite and 2.5d @xcite .",
    "the main focus of these papers has been on coronal heating and driving the solar wind .",
    "thus , while they contained model atmospheres with chromospheres and transition regions , these were not modelled with very high resolution , nor were detailed heating profiles produced specifically for the chromosphere . despite this",
    ", all papers listed above did show that a heating rate broadly consistent with the requirements of both the chromosphere and corona was possible for photospheric motions with speeds of order @xmath3 km s@xmath4 driving alfvnic perturbations .",
    "@xcite extended their original analysis @xcite and improved the diagnostics for shock heating and concluded that shock heating was the dominant heating mechanism in the chromosphere .",
    "these simulations did not explicitly include resistivity or assess the sensitivity of these results to the chosen driver spectrum . nonetheless they present a compelling case for shock heating of the chromosphere originating from a broad spectrum photospheric , alfvnic driver .",
    "the results presented below represent an extension of this line of work , albeit only in one spatial dimension , to assess the importance of explicit resistive dissipation through electron - ion , electron - neutral and ion - neutral collisions .",
    "also studied is the sensitivity of the results to the chosen driver spectrum and a high - resolution focus on just the chromosphere .",
    "turbulence has long been proposed as a possible mechanism by which the input driver wave energy could be dissipated @xcite .",
    "direct dissipation of driver alfvn waves through resistive effects is too slow to explain the required heating rate .",
    "however , if a turbulent cascade exists which can transfer the driver energy to higher wavenumbers where dissipation does occur there is sufficient wave energy in the chromosphere to balance radiative losses .",
    "this theory does however leave unanswered the question of whether a turbulent cascade to dissipation scales does actually exist in the chromosphere . reduced mhd models have recently concluded that alfvn waves may drive a turbulent cascade , through reflection off the transition region , which could heat the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "the implementation of reduced mhd in @xcite ignores compressive effects so does not permit coupling of alfvn waves to slow modes or the formation of shocks .",
    "studies of the resistive dissipation of alfvn waves by collisions between ions and neutral atoms , begun with @xcite , have recently begun to be re - investigated and extended @xcite .",
    "the temperature variation through the chromosphere means that it contains both regions where the hydrogen is near fully ionized and regions where only heavy ions with a low first ionization potential are ionized @xcite . under low - ionization conditions the ion and neutral gas fluids partly decouple , and energy dissipation due to ion - neutral collisions is orders of magnitude more important than the resistivity resulting from electron - ion coulomb collisions @xcite .",
    "previous work in this area has shown efficient heating of both the upper chromosphere @xcite and the lower chromosphere @xcite due to ion - neutral collisions .",
    "numerical simulations in this area are complicated by the simultaneous requirements to resolve short driver wavelengths and a high alfvn speed in the upper chromosphere .",
    "@xcite also include the hall term in chromospheric heating models further reducing the timestep in the simulations . the computational effort that is required to simultaneously resolve",
    "all of these length and time scales means that 1.5d modeling is often used to model alfvn wave propagation and heating in the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "these have shown that alfvn waves with periods much less than 10 seconds are effectively damped by pedersen resistivity @xcite in the chromosphere , and for incompressible simulations with a kolmogorov driving spectrum the heating is primarily in the lower chromosphere and sufficient to balance radiative losses there @xcite .",
    "there is therefore compelling observational and theoretical evidence that a significant fraction of the heating requirements of the upper chromosphere , and possibly the quiet corona , could be accounted for through the dissipation of alfvn wave energy , or mhd waves in general in geometries which make pure alfvn waves unlikely .",
    "this paper extends the earlier works by concentrating specifically on the chromosphere and varying the spectrum of driven alfvn waves , solving the full compressible mhd equations and including partially ionized plasmas .",
    "section [ sec : numtech ] covers the assumptions made , the numerical method and driver spectra used in the simulations .",
    "since much previous work on turbulent heating @xcite assumed an incompressible plasma incompressible results are presented in section [ sec : incompressible ] .",
    "full compressible simulations results are presented in section [ sec : compressible ] and conclusions which can be drawn from these 1.5d simulations are in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "this paper presents the results of numerical simulations performed using the hall - mhd code lare @xcite .",
    "this code solves the ideal mhd equations explicitly using the lagrangian remap approach and includes the resistive and hall terms using explicit subcycling .",
    "the complete set of mhd equations relevant in this case are    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the mass density , @xmath7 is the ideal gas pressure , @xmath8 is the magnetic field , @xmath9 is the fluid velocity , @xmath10 is the electric field , @xmath11 is the specific internal energy density , @xmath12 is the electron number density , @xmath13 is the proton charge and @xmath14 are the current densities parallel / perpendicular to the local magnetic field .",
    "these equations are in written in lagrangian form where @xmath15 is the usual advective derivative .",
    "shock viscosity is added to the momentum equation through @xmath16 which has a functional form which vanishes for smooth flows in the limit of increasing resolution but remains finite at discontinuities .",
    "thus the shock jump conditions are satisfied through an appropriate shock viscosity as in @xcite . in this formulation shock heating",
    "can therefore be monitored though viscous heating . hence viscous",
    "heating and shock heating are used as synonyms throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "missing from equation  ( [ eq : energy ] ) are thermal conduction , radiative losses and all non - local radiation transport . to prevent the atmosphere heating up without bounds due to the viscous dissipation of shocks ( @xmath17 ) and ohmic heating ( @xmath18 ) , both @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "are calculated in simulations as a diagnostic but only @xmath17 is added to the energy update . if @xmath19 , as in incompressible simulations , ignoring @xmath18 assumes that the background atmosphere is for a slowly varying chromosphere where heating terms are approximately balanced by losses .",
    "shock heating must be included in compressible simulations otherwise the shocks themselves are not treated correctly .",
    "this leads to a heating of the chromosphere . despite this",
    "the ionization state is held fixed at its initial equilibrium value .",
    "since shock heating , which is only weakly sensitive to the ionization state , dominates in these simulations this will not change the heating rates by more than a factor @xmath20 .",
    "the resistive mhd ohm s law for a fully ionized plasma is @xmath21 @xcite where @xmath22 is the classical electron - ion resistivity resulting from coulomb scattering and @xmath23 is the electron - ion collision frequency for ion number density @xmath24 and coulomb logarithm @xmath25 . @xmath26 and the resistivity is anisotropic . normally within solar and space physics , where the lundquist number is high",
    ", this is simplified to @xmath27 with an isotropic resistivity .",
    "this approximations is adopted in this paper so ohmic dissipation resulting from parallel currents is likely to be over estimated by a factor @xmath28 . in the 1.5d simulations in this paper",
    "there can be no current along the background magnetic field so the leading order ohmic dissipation from electron - ion collisions is for perpendicular currents .    in equation  ( [ eq : ohm ] ) ,",

    "explicitly the resistivities used in this paper are : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the electron collision frequency including collisions with ion and neutrals .",
    "the pedersen resistivity is then given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the neutral fraction with @xmath35 the number density of neutrals .",
    "the ion - neutral collision frequency is given by @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the cross - section for ion - neutral collisions for hydrogen from @xcite . for an effective ion mass of 1.2 proton masses @xmath38 .",
    "the pressure gradient term @xmath39 is ignored in equation [ eq : ohm ] as this can only generate a parallel electric field in 1.5d simulations which have no effect on the dynamic equations .    in the above descriptions of resistivities",
    "we have adopted the nomenclature used in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we also use cowling resistivity ( @xmath40 ) , defined as @xmath41 , to refer to that component of perpendicular resistivity which arises purely due to ion - neutral collisions .",
    "it is important to note that the pedersen resistivity is only the inverse of the pedersen conductivity , more commonly used in ionospheric physics , if the hall term is zero .",
    "the inclusion of neutrals in a single - fluid model , as described above , is valid in the same limit as resistive mhd , i.e. timescales larger than the gyro - period , collision times and the plasma period and length - scales larger than the ion gyroradius and collisional mean - free - path .",
    "the only additional constraint , compared to single fluid mhd , is therefore that equations ( 1 - 6 ) are only valid for times larger than the ion - neutral collision time . in the chromosphere",
    "this can be as low as a millisecond so the model is valid up to frequencies of @xmath42 hz .    in all simulations",
    "the @xmath43 axis is ignorable , the @xmath44 axis extends vertically up from the solar surface starting at the @xmath45 optically thick surface , and the @xmath46 axis is also ignorable , while velocities in the @xmath46 direction are allowed and associated with alfvnic perturbations .",
    "the upper boundary condition is kept open by the use of both riemann characteristic open boundaries and a damping region where the simulation velocity is smoothly reduced as it approaches the boundary .",
    "the measured reflection of the upper boundary is less than 0.01% . in some sections",
    "lare is converted into a 1.5d incompressible code by setting the forces parallel to the @xmath44 axis to zero .",
    "this sets @xmath47 , which in 1.5d is equivalent to the incompressible condition @xmath48 .",
    "for the simulations presented in this paper , a model atmosphere based on the semi - empirical c7 model of avrett & loeser @xcite is used for the initial temperature profile .",
    "this is then integrated iteratively to provide a density profile which is in hydrostatic equilibrium . on each iteration",

    "for comparison , figure  [ fig : eta ] also shows the same plots for the two other atmospheric models : the val iii c model of @xcite and the fal a model of @xcite .",
    "it is found that the density of neutral hydrogen predicted by the athay potential model and the associated pedersen resistivity are similar in all cases although the fal a model does predict 5 times greater pedersen resistivity in the upper chromosphere .",

    "the spectra of the used drivers , for differing cut - off frequencies , are show in figure  [ fig : driver ] .",
    "this form of the driver is based on that used by @xcite , although they specified a net average poynting flux of @xmath63 .",
    "there is no observational evidence for such a driver spectrum .",
    "instead this has been chosen so that the r.m.s .",
    "velocity matches observations along with the total poynting flux , which constrains the magnetic field once photospheric densities and velocities are defined .",
    "equation [ eq : driver ] therefore has observationally constrained average velocity and integrated flux .",

    "this approximation is not valid .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : poynting_variants ] , where the time - integrated poynting vector calculated using both equations  ( [ eq : approxpoynt ] ) and ( [ eq : fullpoynt ] ) through the lower boundary of a simulation of the solar chromosphere with no dissipation mechanisms present are shown .",
    "these agree up until the first driven alfvn waves from the driver have returned after partial reflection from the transition regions , around 160 seconds , at which point they diverge .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : approxpoynt ] ) overestimates the total poynting flux through the boundary by a factor of up to 2 .",
    "this means that estimates of poynting flux obtained using equation  ( [ eq : approxpoynt ] ) , whether from simulation or observation , are almost certain to be overestimated . in this paper",

    "simulating an alfvn wave spectrum given by equation  ( [ eq : driver ] ) with a high frequency cutoff of 0.1hz , 1hz or 10hz propagating up into the c7 atmosphere ( figure  [ fig : heating_height ] ) , it is found that heating is highest in the photosphere with a local maximum at the temperature minimum .",
    "this is comparable to the results in @xcite and @xcite who used a similar model to that presented here .",
    "since resistive dissipation is more effective for shorter wavelengths and there is no turbulent cascade , the choice of upper cutoff frequency for the driver would be expected to affect the efficiency of the dissipation .",

    "note that the three lines in figure [ fig : heating_height ] are from driver spectra where the amplitudes have been changed so that the net poynting flux is the same in all three cases .",
    "for the 10 hz cut - off the total heating rate in the chromosphere is only of the order of @xmath77 .",
    "the majority of the input energy in these simulations goes into increasing the energy stored in long wavelength alfvn waves in the chromosphere and not into heating .",
    "a fraction of the total input power does leak into the corona , see later , but the continual buildup of alfvn wave energy at long wavelength throughout the simulations , while correct for the incompressible simulations , is unphysical and can only be corrected by the inclusion of compressibility .    , equation [ pedersen ] , ( black solid line ) or cowling resistivity only , @xmath78 ( orange dashed line ) with a 0.1hz cut - off in the driver spectrum . ]    as with @xcite it is found that heating in the photosphere and low chromosphere is dominated by dissipation due to classical resistivity ( figure  [ fig : resist_height ] ) while heating in the upper chromosphere is mainly due to cowling resistivity .",
    "the largest heating rates occur in the parts of the simulation that are dominated by electron - ion and electron - neutral resistivity .",
    "the qualitative features of figure  [ fig : heating_height ] can be reproduced with a simple analytic approach .",
    "this assumes that the heating is from a single pass of alfvn waves and all wavelengths are less than the density scale height .",
    "if only alfvn waves are present then the alfvn wave energy @xmath79 is determined by @xmath80 with @xmath81 given by equation  ( [ eq : approxpoynt ] ) and @xmath29 the total resistivity . since @xmath82 in steady state ,",

    "is an estimate of the required volumetric heating rate as a function of height taken from @xcite .",
    "this heating rate is not well defined below the temperature minimum .    for the incompressible simulations there is no coupling between modes in 1.5d . as a result",
    "it is easy to estimate the effective transmission coefficient of the transition region as a function of frequency without the complication which would arise from mode coupling in a non - linear simulation .",
    "the transmission coefficient is calculated as the ratio of the poynting flux , as a function of frequency , just above the transition region to the poynting flux at the base of the simulation domain .",
    "this is then smoothed with a boxcar moving average of 0.005 hz width and plotted in figure  [ trans_coeff ] .",
    "transmission ranges between 40% at 0.5hz to 0.32% at 0.001hz .",
    "only higher frequencies have appreciable transmission coefficients as the shorter wavelengths see a density ramp rather than a discontinuity at the transition region .",
    "for frequencies above 0.5 hz the measured transmission drops due to these frequencies been damped by pedersen resistivity before they reach the transition region .",
    "the overall energy budget from incompressible simulations is therefore that high frequency , i.e. greater than 0.1 hz , alfvn waves can both heat the upper chromosphere and leak into the corona .",
    "the majority of the chromospheric heating in incompressible simulations come from these high - frequency waves .",
    "for the chosen power law spectrum with r.m.s .",
    "amplitude @xmath88 at the photosphere the typical heating rate above 1000 km is of the order of @xmath89 for a 50 g vertical field .",
    "the peak chromospheric heating required to balance radiative and conductive losses are @xmath90 with rates of @xmath91 needed in the upper chromosphere @xcite .",
    "higher heating rates could be achieved with the kolmogorov driver used here by choosing a stronger background field strength or alternatively a higher r.m.s .",
    "velocity driver could be used .",
    "either of these would however increase the poynting flux in the observed low - frequency part of the spectrum and thus contradict observations .",
    "another possibility is that distribution of alfvn waves deviates significantly from a @xmath92 power law and has more energy at higher frequencies .",
    "this would require orders of magnitudes more energy in the high - frequencies contradicting our assumption of a turbulent photospheric driver with a power - law spectra and is not studied further here .",
    "the incompressible model in 1.5d can not be turbulent and there is no cascade of energy to smaller scales .",
    "the heating rate from pedersen resistivity can be made to match the chromospheric heating requirements by ensuring sufficient energy is input into the base of the simulation in frequencies which are damped by ion - neutral collisions .",
    "the heating rates as a function of height are therefore entirely dependent on the user - specified input spectrum which for these frequencies is poorly constrained by observations .",
    "work by hollweg @xcite and others have also shown the importance of ponderomotive coupling of alfvn waves to slow and fast modes in a compressive medium . in this section",
    "we repeat the simulations of section  [ sec : incompressible ] for the full set of compressible mhd equations . as before the heating due to pedersen resistivity",
    "is calculated but not added into the simulation thermal energy .",
    "this approach is not possible for the shock heating which is allowed in compressible simulation , as this is required to ensure the correct shock jump conditions .",
    "an inevitable consequence of this is that the model atmosphere heats up due to shock dissipation .",
    "the pedersen resistivity is however kept at the same profile as derived from the initial conditions . in the absence of conductive and radiative losses",
    "the shock heating would ionize the chromosphere and turn - off cowling resistivity , i.e. that part of the pedersen resistivity due to ion - neutral collisions .",
    "this lack of self - consistency is shown below to not be significant as the dominant heating is through shock dissipation not resistivity .",
    "a limitation of the 1.5d model used here is that the net ponderomotive force from a persistent photospheric driver lifts the transition region and changes the atmospheric density structure .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : density ] .        in a compressible simulation energy cascades to shorter scale - lengths",
    "are now permitted .",
    "this can clearly be seen in figure  [ comp_spect_en ] , where the spectral energy in alfvn waves from a driver introducing wave energy between 0.001  hz and 0.1  hz ( black line ) is compared to the energy present in the upper chromosphere ( 2000  km above the photospheric surface ) .",
    "power at frequencies above the driver cutoff are clearly present in the upper chromosphere .",
    "this is not a purely alfvnic cascade as it shows the characteristic -2 spectral power of a shock dominated system , but it does provide a mechanism by which shorter length scales can be created self - consistently within the simulation . as a check of the simulations for consistence against observations we note that the velocity field 2000 km above the photosphere in these simulations is @xmath93 km / s .",
    "transverse velocities observed for spicules by de pontieu et al .",
    "@xcite were @xmath94 km / s .        .",
    "both lines are smoothed with a boxcar moving average of width 0.05  hz . [ comp_spect_en ]        figure  [ shock_plot ] shows that slow mode shocks are produced in the simulations . since the entropy jump across the shock can heat the plasma , care must be taken to correctly reproduce this shock heating . in order to ensure that shocks in the simulations satisfy the entropy condition in the shock jump relations , lare uses the artificial viscosity formulation of @xcite which both viscously changes the velocity and deposits the associated viscous heating . in the limit of infinite resolution",
    "this viscosity goes to zero in smooth regions of the solution and satisfies the shock jump conditions at discontinuities .",
    "however , at finite resolution viscosity is erroneously applied to parts of the solution which are steep on the scale of the grid , but are not true discontinuities .",
    "this means that careful convergence testing of the results of the simulations is required to confirm that the heating is due to shocks and not due to numerical error .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ heating_compress ] where it is shown that shock heating is more important in the upper chromosphere than resistive heating , and also that the shock heating rate is converged in these simulations to within 10% in the chromosphere .",
    "while shock heating rates in the photosphere are not converged , they are clearly lower than the well - converged resistive heating rate at those heights",
    ". the light red dash dot line on figure  [ heating_compress ] shows the heating rate from the incompressible simulations .",
    "it can be seen that the overall resistive heating rate is similar in both compressible and incompressible simulations , but that additional resistive heating in the upper chromosphere is observed in the compressible simulations . despite this , it is still 4 orders of magnitude lower than the shock heating rate .",
    "figure  [ visc_freq ] shows that shock heating in the compressible simulations is the same for both cut - off frequencies above 0.1 hz .",
    "no results are shown for a cut - off of 10 hz as these are the same as those for 1 hz .",
    "the shock heating rate is higher than the heating rate needed to balance conduction and radiation in the chromosphere for a realistic driver amplitude .",
    "this may be explained by artificial effects of these 1.5d simulations .",
    "in particular , the missing vertical structure of the magnetic field and the artificial enhancement of shock strength due to shock coalescence - only possible in 1.5d . it is therefore possible to limit the heating due to pedersen resistivity by imposing a cut - off on photospheric driver frequencies of 0.1 hz while maintaining the same level of shock heating .",
    "the extent to which this may be true in a realistic chromosphere can not be addressed in 1.5d models and must be tested in 2d and 3d . for a driver cut - off frequency of 0.01 hz the shock heating",
    "is reduced by three orders of magnitude",
    "the simulations presented in this paper show that it may be possible to heat the solar chromosphere by dissipating alfvn wave energy . if energy is present in high enough frequency modes then resistive heating from pedersen resistivity is sufficient to heat the solar chromosphere directly .",
    "the presence of such high frequency modes is not currently observable .",
    "however , if compressive effects are included then shock heating is capable of heating the chromosphere for a broad range of driver spectrum in a 1.5d model . in compressible simulations shock heating",
    "dominates over resistive dissipation in the upper chromosphere even for driver spectra with high frequency components .",
    "a problem with all 1.5d models is that shocks can coalesce and as a result the shock heating reported here is certainly an over - estimate .",
    "also absent from the current model is the flux expansion expected in chromospheric flux tubes .",
    "in addition , the possibility that the alfvn turbulent cascade , which requires at least two spatial dimensions and would be fastest in 3d , may increase the relative importance of resistive dissipation by increasing the rate at which long wavelength alfvnic energy cascades to the resistive dissipation scale . despite these omissions from the current 1.5d modelling",
    "there are still a number of important conclusions which can be drawn and questions asked to guide future 2d and 3d work .",
    "* evidence from over the last 30 years , e.g. references from @xcite onwards , have all shown that a low - frequency photospheric driver can excite alfvn waves which are of sufficient energy to heat the chromosphere through shock heating .",
    "the slow modes are generated in the chromosphere via ponderomotive driving .",
    "the present study has focused on the chromosphere in more detail , and higher resolution , than previous studies , included pedersen resistivity and confirmed this potential chromospheric heating mechanism .",
    "* while the incompressible results from @xcite are confirmed the observed heating as a function of height is entirely a function of the user specified driver since no energy cascade is present .",
    "furthermore this is not changed by the inclusion of the hall term .",
    "most importantly , the results presented here show that compressible effects dominate the heating by orders of magnitude over pedersen dissipation in the upper chromosphere . *",
    "a turbulent cascade leading to heating @xcite is a possible heating mechanism where alfvn wave energy can be thermalized .",
    "however , compressible mhd effects must be included to check if in multi - dimensions the dominant energy loss from a low - frequency driver is through an alfvn cascade or through coupling to slow modes .",
    "the present 1.5d study suggests that coupling to slow modes , which subsequently shock and heat the chromosphere , is the dominant heating mechanism .    in 2d and",
    "3d the alfvnic turbulent cascade to short scales , and hence dissipation , may be terminated at the dissipation scale of pedersen resistivity .",
    "alternatively , alfvnic wave energy may not reach these scales due to energy loss to slow modes via ponderomotive coupling , through mode coupling at the @xmath95 surface or geometric coupling through flux tube expansion .",
    "while only 1.5d , the current study strongly suggests ponderomotive coupling as the dominant mechanism by which alfvn waves loose energy in the chromosphere .",
    "a final possibility is that energy leaks through the transition region ( figure  [ comp_spect_en ] ) faster than it cascades to the dissipation scale . only full simulations in 2d and 3d will be able to determine which of these effects is most important .",
