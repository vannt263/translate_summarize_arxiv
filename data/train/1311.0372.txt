    "one of the motivations of this paper is the asymptotic analysis of the generalized laguerre polynomials , denoted by @xmath7 , with complex varying parameters , whose definition and properties can be found for instance in chapter v of szeg s classic memoir @xcite .",

    "when indeterminacy occurs in evaluating the coefficients in , we understand them in the sense of their analytic continuation with respect to @xmath1 . with this convention",
    "we see that @xmath10 so that @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath12 , @xmath7 is the unique ( up to a multiplicative constant ) polynomial solution of the differential equation @xmath13 which shows that every zero of @xmath7 different from @xmath14 must be simple .",
    "in fact , multiple zeros ( at the origin ) can appear if and only if @xmath15 . in this case",
    "the reduction formula @xmath16 shows that @xmath14 is a zero of @xmath17 of multiplicity @xmath18 , see again @xcite for details .",
    "orthogonality conditions satisfied by the laguerre polynomials can be easily derived from iterating integration by parts , see e.g.  @xcite ; we reproduce the arguments in section [ sec : orthogonality ] for the sake of completeness .",
    "the weight of orthogonality is the algebraic function @xmath19 and the integration goes along a contour in the complex plane .",
    "the classical situation is @xmath20 , in which case the orthogonality of @xmath21 reduces to @xmath22 as a consequence , for @xmath23 zeros of @xmath21 are positive and simple .    in this paper",
    "we study sequences of laguerre polynomials with , in general , complex parameters @xmath1 depending on the degree @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , we assume that @xmath24 with these hypotheses , but only for _",
    "real _ parameters @xmath25 , sequences @xmath26 were studied , in particular , in @xcite ( weak asymptotics ) and in @xcite ( strong asymptotics ) .",
    "this paper is a natural continuation of this study , although complex values of @xmath6 introduce an asymmetry that makes the problem more difficult .",
    "the main ingredient of the asymptotic analysis is the right choice of the contour of orthogonality , which is related to the trajectories of an associated quadratic differential .",
    "precisely the description of the structure of these trajectories ( section [ sec : trajectories ] ) constitutes the core of our contribution .",
    "it is known that under assumptions we need to perform a linear scaling in the variable in order to fix the geometry of the problem .",
    "thus , we will study the sequence @xmath27 the zeros of @xmath28 cluster along certain curves in the complex plane , corresponding to trajectories ( known also as stokes lines ) of a quadratic differential , depending on a parameter @xmath6 , see figure  [ fig : cerostray ] .",
    "this is not surprising : as it follows from the pioneering works of stahl @xcite , and later of gonchar and rakhmanov @xcite , the support of the limiting zero - counting measure of such polynomials is a set of analytic curves exhibiting the so - called @xmath29-property . they can also be characterized as trajectories of a certain quadratic differential on the riemann surface .",
    "the explicit expression of the quadratic differential associated to polynomials @xmath28 can be easily derived from the differential equation , see @xcite for details .     for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "]    it turns out that for @xmath32 , the support of the limiting zero - counting measure for @xmath28 s is a simple analytic and real - symmetric arc , which as @xmath6 approaches @xmath33 , closes itself to form for @xmath34 the well - known szeg curve @xcite .",
    "when @xmath35 , the support becomes an interval of the positive semi - axis .",
    "case @xmath36 is special : generically , the support is connected , and consists of a closed loop surrounding the origin together with an interval of the positive semi - axis .",
    "however , when @xmath25 s are exponentially close to integers , the support can split into two disjoint components , the closed contour and the interval , see @xcite for details .    in the case @xmath37 the trajectories of these quadratic differentials , and subsequently , the support of the limiting zero - counting measure for @xmath28 s , have not been described ; this is done in section [ sec : trajectories ] , which as we pointed out , is probably one of the central contributions of this paper .    being the generalized laguerre polynomials such a classical object , it is not surprising that their asymptotics has been well studied , using different and complementary approaches based on many characterizations of these polynomials .",
    "many of these results correspond to the case @xmath38 , when all their zeros belong to the positive semi - axis , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "others study the asymptotics with a _ fixed _",
    "parameter @xmath1 , such as in @xcite , where additionally many interdisciplinary applications of laguerre asymptotics are explained .",
    "the gonchar - rakhmanov theory was used to find the weak asymptotics ( or asymptotic zero distribution ) of @xmath28 s for general @xmath5 satisfying , see @xcite ; we extend it to complex @xmath25 s in this work , see section  [ sec : results ] .",

    "the crucial ingredient of this asymptotic analysis is the choice of an appropriate path of integration on the complex plane , based on the structure of the trajectories of the associated quadratic differential .",
    "taking advantage of the results of section [ sec : trajectories ] we prove the existence and describe such paths of integration , which allows us to carry out the steepest descent analysis in the spirit of kuijlaars and mclaughlin . as a result",
    ", we obtain in section  [ sec : results ] the detailed strong asymptotics for the rescaled laguerre polynomials @xmath28 .",
    "this also sheds light on one of the open questions mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the generalized bessel polynomials @xmath42 can be defined as @xmath43 the asymptotic distribution of their zeros and their strong asymptotics is a straightforward consequence of theorems [ teolag1 ] and [ thm : stronga ] below , by replacing @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "the trajectories and the orthogonal trajectories of @xmath59 produce a transversal foliation of the riemann sphere @xmath54 .    in order to study the global structure of these trajectories on the plane",
    "we start by observing that @xmath59 has two zeros , @xmath60 , that are distinct and simple if and only if @xmath61 , and a double pole at the origin if @xmath62 , with @xmath63 another pole of @xmath59 is located at infinity and is of order 4 ; with the parametrization @xmath64 , @xmath65 points from @xmath66 are regular .",

    "however , this fact is not so relevant ; what really matters for our further analysis is the existence of both curves stated in this corollary .    in what follows",
    "we will make use of the contour @xmath101 oriented clockwise , in such a way that @xmath102 is not homotopic to a point in @xmath103 , and the origin remains on the right of the curve .",

    "we turn now to the second goal of this section .",
    "the main tools for the study of the weak asymptotic behavior of polynomials satisfying a non - hermitian orthogonality were developed in the seminal works of stahl @xcite and gonchar and rakhmanov @xcite .",
    "they showed that when the complex analytic weight function depends on the degree of the polynomial , the limit zero distribution is characterized by an equilibrium problem on a compact set in the presence of an external field ; this compact set must satisfy a symmetry property with respect to the external field .    for any positive borel measure @xmath105 on @xmath106 , such that @xmath107 given @xmath6 , @xmath108 , consider the harmonic _ external field _",

    "both the measure @xmath105 and its support @xmath115 have the _ @xmath29-property _ in the external field @xmath112 if at any interior point @xmath116 of @xmath115 , @xmath117 where @xmath118 are the normals to @xmath115 .",

    "it remains to use that the last term in the right hand side vanishes on @xmath75 and is strictly positive on @xmath104 ( see corollary  [ prop : progressive ] ) to conclude that for @xmath105 in characterization holds .",
    "finally , since @xmath128 , harmonic in @xmath129 , is identically @xmath130 on @xmath131 and is the real part of the analytic function @xmath132 satisfying @xmath133 on @xmath75 , the symmetry property easily follows from the cauchy  riemann equations .    in the next section",

    "now we have all ingredients to formulate and prove the asymptotic results for the rescaled generalized laguerre polynomials @xmath28 , defined in in section [ sec : intro ] , under the assumption .",
