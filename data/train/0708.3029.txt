    "in low - dimensional antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg spin ladders , the mixing of magnetic frustration , external magnetic fields , and thermal fluctuations together with quantum fluctuations is a recipe for interesting non - conventional and exotic behaviours .",
    "the two - leg frustrated ladder is an example , which is characterized by three distinct non - magnetic quantum spin liquid states ; the nel - type ( n - type ) state , ferromagnetic - type rung ( r - type ) state , and ferromagnetic - type chain ( f - type ) state .",
    "these states are characterized by ferromagnetic spin arrangements along the diagonals , rungs , or chains respectively . in a recent work , we studied the effect of thermal fluctuations on these states and found that the quantum phase transitions between the r - type and n - type states on one hand and between the r - type and f - type states on the other hand evolve with temperature into classical phase transitions between these disordered states  @xcite .",
    "numerical studies  @xcite have shown that in the presence of a magnetic field , frustration is able to stabilize a magnetization plateau at half the saturation magnetization . in terms of the jordan - wigner ( jw ) fermions  @xcite , this would mean that a plateau in the magnetization appears because of the appearance of an energy gap between two ( excitation ) energy bands .",
    "in this paper we will check this claim within the analytical bond - mean - field theory ( bmft )  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the interplay between the quantum criticality induced by frustration and that produced by magnetic field .",
    "indeed , magnetic field has been shown recently to induce quantum criticality between two distinct states , one characterized by spin bond `` order '' and the other one by no spin bond order , in the heisenberg chain and non - frustrated two - leg ladder  @xcite .",
    "note that spin bond order does not imply any kind of magnetic long range order ; i.e. , all the states are magnetically disordered in agreement with the mermi - wagner theorem  @xcite .    in section [ sec : method ]",
    "the bmft is briefly reviewed . in section [ sec : results ] the magnetization , phase diagram , mean - field parameters , energy spectra , and susceptibility are examined . in section",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] conclusions are drawn .",
    "we apply bmft following the method described in ref .",
    "the hamiltonian for the spin-@xmath0 two - leg ladder with diagonal interactions in a magnetic field is written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the coupling along the chains , @xmath3 the transverse coupling , and @xmath4 the coupling along the diagonals as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : two leg ladder ] .",
    "the index @xmath5 labels the position of the spins along the two chains , each of which has @xmath6 sites .",
    "the first term represents the interactions of nearest - neighboring spins along the chains ( legs ) of the ladder , the second term represents the interactions of the spins along the rungs , and the third term sums the interactions along the diagonals . as usual",

    "@xmath8 with @xmath9 being the magnetic field , @xmath10 the land factor , and @xmath11 the bohr magneton .",

    "the phases @xmath14 are chosen so that all the spin commutation relations are preserved .",
    "the @xmath15 operator creates a spinless fermion at site @xmath16 , while @xmath17 annihilates one , and @xmath18 is the occupation number operator . using  ( [ eq:2d jw ] ) , the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) becomes @xmath19- h \\sum_{i}^n \\sum_{j=1}^{2 } ( n_{i}-\\frac{1}{2}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after applying the jw transformation the ising terms are decoupled using the hartree - fock approximation , which neglects fluctuations around the mean field points ; @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are quadratic in @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite . to apply bmft",
    "we introduce three mean - field bond parameters ; @xmath25 in the longitudinal direction , @xmath26 in the transverse direction , and @xmath27 along the diagonal .",
    "these can be interpreted as effective hopping energies for the jw fermions in the longitudinal , transverse and diagonal directions , respectively @xcite : @xmath28 we choose to place an alternating phase of @xmath29 along the chains so that the phase per plaquette is @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this configuration is used to get rid of the phase terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "we also set @xmath30 where @xmath25 is site independent @xcite . here",
    "@xmath31 is the phase of the bond along the chain such that @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "this is necessary in order to recover the proper result in the limit @xmath4 and @xmath34 becoming zero , in which we get a result comparable to that of des cloiseaux and pearson  @xcite for the spin excitation spectrum for a single heisenberg chain , @xmath35    the magnetization per site is @xmath36 . once a magnetic field is applied the magnetization must be included in the decoupling of the ising terms .",
    "the latter must be decoupled as many ways as is physically acceptible in order to account for all effects .",
    "so in addition to the previous two ways  @xcite it is now decoupled in the following third way : @xmath37 the mean - field hamiltonian becomes @xmath38        as mentioned in the introduction , when @xmath39 , the system adopts the n - type state with ferromagnetic spin arrangements along the diagonals .",
    "when @xmath40 the system adopts the r - type state . in this case , the af spin arrangements shift to the diagonals , and spins on the rungs are forced to adopt a ferromagnetic arrangement . when @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the system adopts the f - type state , where the spins on the chains adopt a ferromagnetic arrangement and an af one on the rungs .",

    "the free energies are compared as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : magfree ] to determine the state with the lowest free energy , which is in turn used to obtain the parameters and magnetization . as fig  [ fig :",
    "magfree]b shows for the given coupling constants set , a first transition occurs from the n - type state to the f - type state , then another one from the f - type state to the r - type state .",
    "note that this couple of transitions was not mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , which used the lanczos method .",
    "our approach works well for analyzing the effect of magnetic field when @xmath57  @xcite , and when @xmath58 and @xmath59  @xcite . including both @xmath4 and @xmath60 may be pushing the the current mean - field approach to its limits . in the strong field regime",
    "all free energies are equal because the magnetization has saturated and all af fluctuations have disappeared ; i.e. , even short - range af correlations are absent in the saturated ferromagnetic state .",
    "the magnetization @xmath61 calculated using bmft is displayed as a function of magnetic field in fig .  [",
    "fig : mag2]a for three sets of coupling values also used in ref .  @xcite . because all the states are gapped in zero field ,",

    "[ fig : mag2]a .",
    "our curves for @xmath61 compare very well qualitatively with existing numerical results  @xcite . for certain coupling values",
    "a plateau appears at @xmath62 which means that on average half the spins are aligned along the magnetic field .",
    "remember that @xmath63 is the saturation value .",

    "we find that the plateau appears as @xmath69 increases only when @xmath70 . also , when @xmath71 the plateau disappears .",
    "the sharp boundaries in the @xmath62 phase diagrams only appear at @xmath72 . at finite temperature",
    "they are replaced by crossovers .",
    "note that the @xmath64 phase diagram is symmetric with respect to the diagonal because the hamiltonian is symmetric under exchanging the @xmath2 and @xmath69 terms @xcite .",
    "the effect of temperature on the magnetization , and on the magnetization plateau is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag1]a . as temperature increases the size of the plateau decreases , and eventually disappears altogether at high enough temperature .",
    "because of thermal excitations , spins originally locked in the gapped state at zero temperature become available for alignment along the magnetic field .",
    "this leads to the linear increase of magnetization in the low - field regime for @xmath73 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : mag1]a . at @xmath72",
    "there is a critical field at which the magnetization reaches the saturation value @xmath74 , but for nonzero temperatures the critical behaviour is replaced by a crossover regime in a way similar to what was found for the heisenberg chain and two - leg ladder in the absence of frustration @xcite .",
    "the bond - mean - field parameters are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mag1]b and [ fig : mag1]c for @xmath75 and @xmath76 . at the plateau , statistically half of the spins have been aligned with the magnetic field because @xmath62 .",

    "[ fig : mag4 ] . in this case , the average magnetization per site is @xmath62 , and exactly half of the rung bonds , one of the chains , and half of the diagonal bonds are antiferromagnetically arranged .",
    "the bond parameters represent the average af correlations in the directions along which they are calculated , so each of them adopts half of its maximum value in zero field .",
    "the bond parameters vanish in the strong field regime , where the state labeling becomes obsolete and all three free energies equal .",
    "the bond parameters vanish at the same field where the magnetization reaches saturation signaling in this way a quantum ( zero-@xmath78 ) phase transition @xcite .    when @xmath79 , thermal fluctuations spoil this transition .",
    "a crossover behaviour replaces the zero-@xmath78 critical behaviour exactly in the same way as in the heisenberg chain and non - frustrated two - leg ladder @xcite . at high enough temperature",

    "thermal fluctuations round - off the peaks and close the gaps in @xmath86 in agreement with the disappearance of the plateau at high enough temperatures .      the magnetization plateau and its behaviour in general can be explained using the chemical potential and energy band filling of the jw fermions in the same way as in ref .  @xcite .",
