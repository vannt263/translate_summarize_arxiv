    "unusual properties of the ensembles of the non - hermitian operators or matrices are related to the fact that eigenvalues of the operators and matrices can be complex .",
    "completely different methods have been used for study of distributions of the eigenvalues on the complex plane .",

    "although the real magnetic interactions in the hamiltonian with the imaginary vector potential do not correspond to any physical interactions in the initial problem of the vortices , consideration of the @xmath0-model for the unitary ensemble was interesting from the formal point of view because it allowed to establish important relations with the random matrix models .",

    "moreover , numerical results for distributions of complex eigenvalues presented in ref.@xcite demonstrate a pronounced difference between the ensembles .",
    "the distribution of the complex eigenvalues on the complex plane is homogeneous in the case of the unitary ensemble while it shows an _ accumulation _ of the eigenvalues along the real axis .",
