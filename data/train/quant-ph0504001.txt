    "the evaluation of the bethe logarithm , in 1947  @xcite , was carried out using one of the first automatized devices for the implementation of numerical calculations in physics .",
    "today , the evaluation of the ( one - loop ) bethe logarithm for the ground state of hydrogen to about 10 figures of accuracy can be carried in less than a second on a modern workstation .",
    "consequently , one might be tempted ask why there should be yet another paper on bethe logarithms in the first place ?",
    "the answer is threefold : ( i ) in the context of recent efforts toward an improved understanding of the hydrogen and deuterium spectra  @xcite ( see also physics.nist.gov/hdel ) , we have striven to increase the number of states for which this basic quantum electrodynamic correction is known .",
    "( ii ) the bethe logarithm has been found to follow a characteristic asymptotic structure , expressible in terms of a series in inverse powers of the principal quantum numbers .",
    "this asymptotic structure has been found to be applicable to wide classes of quantum electrodynamic effects in atoms  @xcite .",
    "consequently , it appeared to be of interest to verify these asymptotic properties by explicit calculations of the bethe logarithm for very highly excited states .",
    "( iii ) the most comprehensive collection of bethe logarithms recorded so far in the literature  @xcite extends up to the principal quantum number @xmath1 .",
    "here , we consider levels up to @xmath2 .",
    "this should be contrasted with recent experimental investigations  @xcite that were carried out with states of principal quantum numbers as high as @xmath3 .",
    "frequency combs can lead to tremendous simplifications for high - precision spectroscopic experiments ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the future",
    ", it should become feasible to carry out high - precision experiments on transitions much more effectively than in the past .",
    "rydberg states with long natural lifetimes are rather promising candidates for precision metrology , and one might imagine either direct transitions among rydberg states or optical transitions from , e.g. , the metastable @xmath4 state to a highly excited @xmath5 state . such measurements might contribute to future advances in our knowledge of the hydrogen and deuterium spectra . on the theoretical side , the method of least squares  @xcite allows for a self - consistent adjustment of fundamental constants such as the rydberg constant and the proton charge radius , using experimental input data from more than one transition .",
    "the investigation reported here is an element of a project ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) to enlarge the 2002 adjustment of constants  @xcite so as to provide optimal predictions for energy levels not contained in this adjustment , consistent with the values of the constants used in that adjustment .",
    "thus , we here discuss the evaluation of bethe logarithms using two different methods :    * an integral representation which is based on analytic calculations using the sturmian representation of the schrdinger  coulomb green function , * a spectral representation which relies on known results for the transition matrix elements of discrete - discrete and discrete - continuum transitions of hydrogen .",
    "the two methods are found to be suitable for different ranges of principal and angular momentum quantum numbers . while a complete account of all previous work on the bethe logarithm would result in an excessively long list of references",
    ", it might be instructive and appropriate to recall a few previous investigations on this subject  @xcite .",
    "recently , the bethe logarithm has been re - evaluated , for selected hydrogenic states , in the context of lower - order terms acting as preparatory calculations for higher - order relativistic corrections to the self - energy  @xcite .",
    "the basic equation defining the spectral decomposition has been given in eq .",
    "( 2a ) , and the basic equation for the integral representation has been indicated in eq .",

    ", we recall that in table  ii of ref .",
    "@xcite and table  i of ref .",
    "@xcite one may even find results for the particular contributions of the discrete spectrum and of the continuum to the bethe logarithm of selected low - lying states .",
    "in general , we found that unexpected numerical difficulties affect the calculation of bethe logarithms for rydberg states , especially in cases where the difference @xmath6 of the principal quantum number @xmath7 and the orbital quantum number @xmath8 is large . here , we attempt to enhance both the range of applicability of the integral representation as well as the spectral representation , by the use of convergence acceleration methods  @xcite for the evaluation of hypergeometric functions that characterize propagator matrix elements ( integral representation ) and the calculation of infinite sums over discrete virtual intermediate states ( spectral representation ) .",
    "( at least ) two further methods are available for the evaluation of bethe logarithms : one of these is based on the determination of approximate eigenfunctions obtained using finite basis sets  @xcite , which may be combined with a neville ",
    "richardson extrapolation to yield accurate values , thereby decreasing the required number of functions in the basis set .",
    "basis - set methods are also used in calculations of bethe logarithms in helium ( see e.g. ref .",
    "a fourth method relies on a discrete - space ( lattice ) evaluation of the radial component of the schrdinger ",
    "coulomb propagator  @xcite .",
    "this method is briefly discussed in appendix  [ drep ] .",
    "a somewhat special role is played by circular rydberg states with @xmath9  @xcite , whose probability density around the atomic nucleus approximately has the shape of a rotationally symmetric , `` circular '' tire ( see fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but this shape is restricted to the highest possible magnetic angular momentum projection . because the bethe logarithm does not depend on @xmath10 , we will refer to all states with @xmath11 as circular states in this article .",
    "circular states have the highest possible @xmath8 for given @xmath7 . in the context of the current numerical investigation",

    "the coefficients of this polynomial have an alternating sign pattern .",
    "finite sums whose terms display an alternating sign pattern are notoriously problematic in numerical evaluations , because their convergence can not be accelerated with the methods used for infinite series , and the straightforward summation of the terms , using multiprecision arithmetic , is often the only practical route to a reliable numerical evaluation .",
