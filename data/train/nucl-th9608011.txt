    "we have recently undertaken the task of revitalizing and extending a semi - microscopic theory of collective motion for odd nuclei that we shall refer to as the kerman - klein - dnau - frauendorf ( kkdf ) model @xcite .",
    "this model , aside from the elements discussed for the first time in the present paper , was introduced in close to its present form by dnau and frauendorf @xcite , whose work was in turn stimulated by an application @xcite of the theory of collective motion developed by kerman and klein @xcite .    in the presentation of our work at seminars and conferences ,",
    "one question that has invariably arisen is the connection between the kkdf model and the conventional core - particle coupling model , especially for deformed nuclei , to which our published applications have so far been confined .",
    "even if we widen the inquiry to the connection between the shell model and the core - particle model , we find that the literature on this subject is sparse .",
    "we are aware of only two publications that have been addressed specifically to this topic .",
    "the earlier of these papers @xcite showed how all , then extant , core - particle coupling models could be understood as approximations to the work of kerman and klein .",
    "this paper appears to have gone completely unnoticed , since it is not quoted in the later work @xcite , which is devoted to the derivation of the strong coupling core - particle model from a schematic shell model . in the book by ring and schuck @xcite , which appeared betweentimes ,",
    "the success of the strong coupling model in its domain of application is heralded but at the same time proclaimed a mystery .",
    "the main purposes of the present work are threefold .",
    "the first is to transform the kerman - klein equations from the `` laboratory '' system in which they are derived and conveniently applied to the `` intrinsic '' system , when it makes sense to define such a system , as is done in the strong coupling core - particle model .",
    "the resulting theory is completely equivalent to the starting one and does not yet constitute the standard phenomenological model .",
    "a second purpose is to describe and implement the approximation that leads to the standard model .",
    "we describe in most detail how this may be done in the intrinsic system , the usual choice , but emphasize that the approximation may equally be defined in the laboratory system and that the latter approach has some advantages .",
    "the essential point here may be described as follows . in the physical situation , which requires the inclusion of pairing interactions ,",
    "the number of solutions of the full kkdf model is twice as great as the number of physical states being described .",
    "hitherto , the major technical difficulty ( and consumption of cpu time ) of this method has been the application of a criterion to select the physical solutions . for the ground state problem",
    "there is the well - known property of the bcs theory that the physical solutions ( quasiparticles ) correspond to positive energies and the unphysical ones to negative energies . in the kkdf model",
    "the strategy is to ignore initially rotational excitation energies so as to collapse each band to a single degenerate state to which the ground state criterion can be applied .",
    "we then step up the excitation energies , returning them finally to their full values ; at each step we select the physical solutions by a projection technique described in our cited work , that involves an extension of the techniques introduced by dnau and frauendorf .",
    "another way of stating the problem that is directly related to the traditional core - particle model is to remark that although only half of the solutions of the kkdf model are related to physics , the full set of solutions is necessary for mathematical completeness .",
    "the solutions of our equations at full excitation can be expanded in terms of the complete set generated at zero excitation , but this expansion will involve both physical and unphysical states of the latter limit . in the conventional core - particle model it is assumed that the physical states of the actual problem are well approximated by a superposition of the physical solutions at zero excitation .",
    "it follows from this that it suffices to solve a single eigenvalue problem for the problem of actual interest rather than having to solve a sequence of such problems .",
    "the third purpose of this paper is to carry through several illustrative calculations using both the kkdf model and the approximation to it just described , in order to assess the validity of the latter .",
    "in the course of rethinking our algorithms in preparation for this study , we have discovered a method of simplifying the full calculation to a sufficient extent that much of the advantage of technical simplicity of the core - particle limit has been wiped out .",
    "we shall also describe this new development .",
    "we start in secs .",
    "ii and iii with a review of the fundamental equations of the kerman - klein method , in order to introduce some improvements in notation and presentation , as well as to correct some phase errors made previously in the formulas for transition matrix elements . in sec .",
    "iv we transform our equations ( without approximation ) to a description in terms of an intrinsic frame of reference . starting from these equations , the definition and formulation of the strong coupling core - particle model in its usual form in the intrinsic system",
    "is given in sec .  v. it is explained in sec .",
    "vi that an equivalent and possibly more effective version of this limit can perfectly well be carried out in the laboratory system . turning to applications ,",
    "our new algorithm is described in sec .",
    "vii and then applied together with the standard core - particle model to some illustrative cases in sec .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in sec .",
    "two appendices provide some technical details of the derivation carried out in sec .",

    "( [ eq : vee ] ) and ( [ eq : you ] ) , it is necessary to interchange the order of the single - fermion operator and the pair operator in the interaction terms of ( [ eq : eom2 ] ) .",
    "this leads to further contributions to the single - particle energy in this equation , in that @xmath30 is replaced by @xmath31 , with @xmath32    in terms of a convenient and physically meaningful set of energy differences and sets of multipole fields and pairing fields defined below , we obtain generalized matrix equations of the hartree - bogoliubov form @xmath33 here @xmath34 furthermore @xmath35 refer to the ground state energies of the neighboring even nuclei , the matrix elements of @xmath36 are derived from those of ( [ eq : def5 ] ) simply by the replacement of the operator @xmath37 by @xmath38 , and the matrix elements of @xmath39 are similarly derived from those of @xmath40 by the replacement of @xmath41 by @xmath42 together with the interchange @xmath43 .",

    "vi , this relation can be studied using the formalism already at hand ( theory expressed in the `` laboratory '' system of coordinates ) ; in fact it turned out to be economical for us to carry out all numerical work from this standpoint . nevertheless , in the following two sections we shall undertake to develop the connection between our method and the way such calculations are normally presented in the intrinsic system .",
    "our justification for this digression is that whenever we have presented a public account of our previous work in this field , one question invariably raised was precisely this connection . in what follows ,",
    "we shall answer the question raised in two steps . in the first",

    "we are thus assuming that the eigenstates of the even nuclei have axial symmetry and that their eigenstates can be assigned a definite value of @xmath62 , the component of the angular momentum along the figure axis .",
    "this assumption is reasonable as long as the states of the same angular momentum belonging to different bands are well - separated in energy .",

    "we introduce a condensed notation for ( [ eq : red1 ] ) and ( [ eq : red2 ] ) , writing them in the operator form @xmath150    we solve these equations in the approximation that forms part of the definition of the core - particle model .",
    "again we consider first the simplest case where only the ground state band of the cores is included .",
    "the extension to excited bands and interband coupling can be dealt with in analogy to the treatment described for the intrinsic system .",
    "let the physical solutions of ( [ eq : red3 ] ) with @xmath151 be designated as @xmath152 , with corresponding energies @xmath153 . here",
    "the symbol @xmath20 abbreviates the set @xmath154 .",
    "we approximate the solutions of the full equation by the expansion @xmath155 the introduction of this expansion into ( [ eq : red3 ] ) leads immediately to the standard eigenvalue problem @xmath156 this equation is to be compared with eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) , to which it is equivalent as long as @xmath157 has the form assumed in the derivation of the latter .",
    "in fact , ( [ eq : final2 ] ) has an advantage in the case that the excitation spectrum is not conveniently expressed in algebraic form , but its numerical values are known from experiment .",
    "we can extend the theory to include multiple bands in the core nuclei .",
    "we use the labels @xmath122 to distinguish the different bands and now take as a zeroth approximation the coupling of the odd particle to a single one of these bands .",
    "the theory is , to start with , the same as that described above except that we must distinguish the results for the various cores , and this is done by a superscript @xmath122 . in",
    "so far as the multipole fields and pairing fields for the band @xmath122 are almost equal to those for the ground band , the energies @xmath158 are almost independent of @xmath122 .",
    "we prefer to lift this degeneracy by shifting each of these energies by @xmath159 , the band head energy , and redefining @xmath157 to be the excitation energy above the band head in each case .",
    "the step that follows is to introduce the mixing due to the core excitations and again only the change in notation already specified is necessary to record the equations that generalize ( [ eq : final2 ] ) and ( [ eq : final3 ] ) .    the final step is to include the further mixing due to interband multipole fields ( assuming that such mixing for the pairing fields can be neglected ) . for this purpose , we decompose @xmath160 into an intraband piece ( subscript @xmath139 ) and an interband part ( subscript @xmath140 ) , the latter having so far been neglected , according to the equation @xmath161 where @xmath138 is the usual pauli matrix .",
    "the perturbation previously neglected is dealt with by the expansion @xmath162 where the mixing coefficients are determined by the conditions @xmath163",
    "the main source of difficulty perceived in the solution of the kkdf equations is that the set of solutions is over - complete by a factor of two .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the basis states form an over - complete ( and , consequently , non - orthogonal set ) .",
    "thus half of the states found by solving the eom are not physical and have to be identified and removed .",
    "the technique previously used to perform this task has now been understood to be unnecessarily complicated .    in the previous approach @xcite the hamiltonian is first decomposed into symmetric and anti - symmetric parts with respect to particle - hole conjugation .",
    "if only the anti - symmetric part is diagonalized , then for every positive energy eigenvalue there is a negative partner . from the bcs theory",
    "we know that the positive eigenvalues are the physical solutions and the negative eigenvalues the non - physical ones",
    ". then the symmetric part is turned on `` slowly '' and at every step the physical solutions are identified using a projection operator built from the wavefunctions of the previous step . since the equations of motion have to be solved at each step , the time needed to perform the calculation is correspondingly longer than for a single diagonalization .",
    "( in most applications a typical number of steps is 5 . )",
    "a simpler and quicker approach has now been identified .",
    "since the problem decomposes into subproblems involving states of a fixed angular momentum , we can invoke the no - crossing theorem .",
    "this means that the relative order in energy of the physical and of the non - physical states does not change as we turn on the symmetric part of the hamiltonian",
    ". if the lower half of the states ( negative in particular ) are the unphysical ones in the bcs limit , then at the physical limit where the full hamiltonian is used , the lower half of the states are again the unphysical ones .",
    "consequently , we need only to solve the equations of motion at the two limits , the bcs limit and the full hamiltonian limit .",
    "these remarks about the technique of solution apply not only to the strong coupling examples studied in the next section , but also to less straightforward applications of the kkdf method .",
    "we illustrate the remarks of the previous sections with applications to a pair of well - deformed nuclei .",
    "the first application is to the nucleus @xmath0gd , which we have studied previously @xcite .",
    "@xmath0gd is a well deformed nucleus and thus suitable for application of the strong coupling core - particle model . to recall a few details",
    ", we used a large single - particle space ( including all states from 5 major shells ) .",
    "the energies and matrix elements of these single - particle levels were calculated using the woods - saxon potential .",
    "the odd neutron is coupled to the cores @xmath164gd and @xmath165gd , which are represented not only by their ground bands , but also by several excited bands , as was found necessary to fit all the observed bands of @xmath0gd .",
    "the core excitation energies , @xmath166 , were given by phenomenological formulas tuned to experiment .",
    "in the same way as in the previous papers , the strength of the quadrupole field is treated as a free parameter and the values of the single - particle energies found from woods - saxon calculations are allowed to vary by @xmath167 .",
    "first we solved the eom problem of the full kkdf model and fixed the strength of the quadrupole force and the single - particle energies in order to achieve the best fit .",
    "then we solved the eom for the core - particle model as described in sec .",
    "[ cplab ] , using the same parameters .",
    "the results are show in fig .",
    "( [ fig : gd157_lev ] ) .",
    "we can see from the figure that the two models give very similar results . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : gd157_be2 ] ) we show the result of the b(e2 ) calculations .",
    "again it is clear that the two models give very similar results .",
    "the second application was to the proton spectrum of @xmath0 tb , with @xmath164gd and @xmath165dy cores .",
    "we used the same method as described above and the results are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : tb157_lev ] ) .",
    "the conclusion is the same as in the previous application , namely that the two methods give very similar results .",
    "observed b(e2 ) values are too few to allow a meaningful comparison .",
    "to the extent that the examples chosen are typical , it is apparent that for well - deformed nuclei the strong coupling core - particle model gives almost as good results as the full kkdf model .",
    "we emphasize , however , the greater range of validity of the kkdf model , in particular to cases such as transitional nuclei @xcite , where none of the usual traditional versions of the core - particle model is applicable .",
    "in this paper , we have studied a semi - microscopic core - particle coupling theory , the kkdf theory , and particularly its relationship to the traditional strong coupling core - particle model .",
    "the kkdf theory is formulated in the laboratory system of coordinates , and as such , can be applied both to the spherical vibrational ( weak coupling ) and deformed rotational ( strong coupling ) regimes , as well as to transitional cases .",
    "a significant portion of this paper has been devoted to transforming the kkdf equations from the laboratory to the intrinsic system of coordinates , the latter defined only for the well - deformed regime .",
    "we have pointed out the additional approximation necessary to reduce the kkdf equations to those of the usual core - particle limit .",
    "we have then applied both the full and the limiting model to a few illustrative nuclei and found only small differences in the numerical results .",
    "this justification is , for our purposes , less significant than it would have been in the past , since we have also formulated an improved algorithm that renders the kkdf equations essentially as simple to deal with as the defined approximation .",
    "the reason for the good agreement between the approximate and the complete theory obviously expresses the fact that there is little mixing between physical and unphysical states as we `` turn on '' the coupling that is initially suppressed in our approach .",
    "this means that they stay well separated in energy .",
    "we can expect this situation to change for applications where there are multiple avoided crossings .",
    "we provide some details of the derivations of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cp2 ] ) .",
    "the first terms that require special attention are those involving the excitation energy in the even nuclei .",
    "we immediately do the sum over @xmath78 .",
    "now consider eq .",

    "we can replace the combination @xmath169 by @xmath170 applying the standard algebra of the raising and lowering operators and shifting the variables @xmath171 as required for these terms , we thus obtain additional contributions of single - particle type as well as the coriolis coupling .",
    "we consider next the contributions of the multipole and pairing fields , a calculation that requires most of the modest labor involved in the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cp2 ] ) . as an example of what is involved",
    ", we compute the contribution of the even multipoles to the right hand side of ( [ eq : cp2 ] ) , which we label @xmath172 . utilizing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xyou ] ) and ( [ eq : q ] ) , we must evaluate the expression @xmath173 in this equation the sum is over all angular momentum variables not indicated explicitly on the left hand side except for @xmath6 , which disappears from the final result .    to evaluate this expression",
    ", we first study the partial sum @xmath174 which can be derived from edmonds ( 6.2.7 ) .",
    "the sum over @xmath175 then removes two more cg coefficients from ( [ eq : tg ] ) the next step is to apply edmonds ( 6.2.6 ) to evaluate the sum over @xmath143 , leading to a final trivial sum over @xmath79 .",
    "we thus find @xmath176    equations ( [ eq : s ] ) and ( [ eq : s ] ) are the essential results for the evaluation of ( [ eq : tg ] ) leading to the appropriate term in ( [ eq : cp2 ] ) .",
    "the pairing term in the same equation and the multipole and pairing terms in ( [ eq : cp1 ] ) can be shown ( after straightforward transformations for the latter ) to involve the same basic sums , up to phase factors .",
    "in the main text , we have included in the general core - particle equations ( [ eq : cp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cp2 ] ) only contributions from even electric multipole - multipole interactions , assuming that the included bands are all of the same parity .",
    "if we wish to include odd electric multipole - multipole forces to lowest order , we must replace the matrix element eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) by the value of the matrix element @xmath177 here @xmath90 , @xmath178 are the spherical tensor components of the angular momentum in the  intrinsic \" system , expressed in terms of the cartesian components ( where they differ ) by the equations @xmath179 with the help of the well - known matrix elements of the intrinsic components , eq .",

    "the calculation parallels that described in the previous appendix .",
    "the sum ( [ eq : s ] ) repeats itself in every case .",
    "the sum ( [ eq : s ] ) is replaced , in general , by different expressions . in the case of the first term of ( [ eq : l1 ] ) ,",
    "the sum @xmath181 is replaced by the sum @xmath182 for @xmath183 , the sum over @xmath143 can be carried out as before , but after this has been done , instead of a final normalization condition for cg coefficients , we encounter the sum @xmath184 which involves the same  trick \" as used in the evaluation of the coriolis coupling . of the terms arising from ( [ eq : l1 ] ) , the first and third require the procedure just described , the second and fourth a similar procedure in which we interchange the order of the sums on @xmath79 and @xmath143 , and the fifth the same calculation as in the previous appendix .",
