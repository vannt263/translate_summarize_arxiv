    "a galaxy is fully described by a distribution function @xmath1 which specifies the positions and velocities of all of its constituent stars and gas .",
    "eddington ( 1916 ) showed how to determine the distribution function for a known spherical mass provided that the galaxy is dynamically isotropic , that is with the binding energy @xmath2 being the only isolating integral .",
    "spherical form is of course an idealisation , and at best an approximation to the true shape .",
    "isotropy is generally also an approximation to the true dynamics @xcite .",
    "our anisotropic models allow us to explore a range of possible dynamical behaviour while still retaining the other simplifying approximation of sphericity .",
    "the step from finding isotropic distribution functions for spherical galaxies to that of finding anisotropic distribution functions for them has turned out to be surprisingly steep @xcite .",
    "anisotropic distribution functions depend also on the modulus of the angular momentum @xmath3 .",
    "because of the limited supply of analytical models , many workers have followed hernquist ( 1993 ) in finding approximate distribution functions by first solving the jeans equations for the velocity dispersions and then using gaussians to provide local velocity distributions .",
    "recently kazantzidis , magorrian & moore ( 2004 ) have shown that this procedure can be hazardous when applied to generate initial conditions for galaxies that are strongly non - gaussian . in such cases , the jeans plus gaussian approximation",
    "can lead to an initial state that is far from equilibrium , so that much of its subsequent development is an artifact of that start . as the importance of numerical simulations increases , the issue of controlling numerical errors in them becomes equally important .",
    "one can avoid invalid initial conditions for n - body and monte - carlo simulations simply by using a three - dimensional monte - carlo simulator on an exact distribution function to derive the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "some of the currently known anisotropic models have constant anisotropies @xcite .",
    "others are of the osipkov - merritt type @xcite and are limited to depending solely on an isolating integral which is a linear combination of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "models of this type are isotropic at small radii but dominated by radial orbits at large radii .",
    "cuddeford ( 1991 ) showed how to modify the osipkov - merritt algorithm to allow for anisotropy at small radii and a central cusp , while ciotti & pellegrini ( 1992 ) constructed composite osipkov - merritt models .",
    "models with a greater variety of anisotropic behaviour are known for special models ; the plummer model @xcite and the hernquist model @xcite .",
    "a greater variety of analytical systems with different and varying kinematics is clearly desirable .",
    "some have recently been provided by an & evans ( 2006a ) .",

    "ours differ because they are for the densities given by the @xmath0-models @xcite .",

    "isotropic distribution functions are known for all @xmath0-models @xcite .",
    "the two new families of analytical anisotropic spherical models , which we present in this paper , introduce an additional parameter @xmath5 which allows the anisotropy of the system to be varied .",

    "the second family is isotropic at small radii , and @xmath8 gives the value of @xmath7 at large radii .",
    "a greater variety of behaviour can be obtained by combining the two families , though we do not pursue that possibility here .    in section [ sec : basics ] we review the basic equations needed for our study , and introduce the @xmath0-models and their isotropic distribution functions . before introducing our first new family in section [ sec : anisomodels ] , we first give some surprisingly simple constant anisotropy @xmath9 models of which only the @xmath10 case was known previously .",

    "kazantzidis , magorrian & moore ( 2004 ) have shown that this procedure can be hazardous when applied to galaxies that are strongly non - gaussian , as it can then lead to an initial state that is far from equilibrium .",
