    "formulation of chiral fermions on the lattice has been one of long - standing problems in lattice field theories .",
    "several years ago , the domain - wall fermion ( dwf ) formalism  @xcite , which is a wilson fermion in @xmath1 dimensions with dirichlet boundary condition in the extra dimension , has been proposed as a new formulation of lattice chiral fermion . in the limit of large extra dimension size , @xmath2 , the spectrum of free domain - wall fermion contains massless modes at the edges in the extra dimension .",
    "while the massless modes are shown to be stable in perturbation theory@xcite , their existence may be spoiled non - perturbatively in the presence of dynamical gauge fields .",
    "we studied this issue through an anomalous quark mass @xmath0 in ref .",
    "this quantity measures the magnitude of chiral symmetry breaking with the domain - wall qcd ( dwqcd ) .    in this article",
    "we make a status report of our attempt to understand the results on the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath0 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite through measurements of the eigenvalue distribution of the 4-dimensional wilson - dirac operator .",
    "we define the anomalous quark mass by@xcite @xmath4 this quantity measures the chiral symmetry breaking effect in the axial ward - takahashi identity : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the axial - vector current , @xmath7 is the pseudoscalar density , and @xmath8 represents the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry . on a smooth gauge field background ,",
    "the anomalous contribution @xmath9 vanishes as @xmath10 at large @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath0 also vanishes exponentially in this case .",
    "= 7.5 cm    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we carried out quenched simulations to study the @xmath3 dependence in detail .",
    "two values of lattice spacing , @xmath11 and 2  gev , are explored , using both the plaquette and an rg - improved gauge actions .",
    "our main results for @xmath0 are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : m5q ] .",
    "the results for the plaquette action are obtained at @xmath12 ( @xmath13  gev ) and 6.0 ( 2  gev ) , and those for the rg - improved action at @xmath14 ( 1  gev ) and 2.6 ( 2  gev ) .",
    "solid lines are fits to @xmath15 , and dashed lines to @xmath16    important points to note in fig .",
    "[ fig : m5q ] are : ( i ) comparing results for the spatial sizes @xmath17 and @xmath18 at @xmath13  gev , we find the finite volume effects in @xmath0 to be small , ( ii ) @xmath0 decreases with the lattice spacing , ( iii ) the magnitude of @xmath0 is smaller for the rg - improved action than for the plaquette action , and ( iv ) from data in the range of @xmath3 we explore , @xmath0 seems to remain non - zero in the limit @xmath19 , in all cases except at @xmath20 for the rg - improved action .",
    "if confirmed with studies at larger values of @xmath3 , the last point means that dwqcd realizes chiral symmetry at @xmath21  gev only for the case of the rg - improved action .",
    "chiral symmetry of dwqcd can be studied also through the transfer matrix in the direction of the extra dimension@xcite .",
    "when the transfer matrix has a unit eigenvalue , chiral symmetry is not realized in dwqcd because the left and right chiral modes on the two edges in the extra dimension couple with each other .",
    "a unit eigenvalue of the transfer matrix is in one - to - one correspondence with a zero eigenvalue of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator defined by @xmath22 which is much easier to calculate . here",
    ", @xmath23 is the four dimensional wilson - dirac kernel with a bare mass @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , a failure of exponential decay of @xmath0 would result if @xmath25 develops a zero eigenvalue .",
    "we calculate eigenvalues of @xmath26 by the lanczos method using 50100 configurations at several values of coupling in the range @xmath272 gev using both plaquette and rg - improved actions .",
    "the results from the lanczos method are checked by the ritz functional method for @xmath25 .",
    "we also study the dependence on the lattice size . the maximum lattice at @xmath27  gev is @xmath28 for both actions , while the one at @xmath21  gev is @xmath29 for the rg - improved action and @xmath30 for the plaquette action .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    in figs .",
    "[ fig : evdistp ] and [ fig : evdistr ] we plot monte carlo time histories for the six lowest eigenvalues of @xmath26 for the plaquette and rg - improved actions . in each figure",
    "the left panel shows results for @xmath13  gev and the right panel for @xmath21  gev .",
    "the lattice size at @xmath31  gev is the same as in the previous work of @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m5q ] .",
    "open squares plot the minimum eigenvalue @xmath32 and filled diamonds are the five higher eigenvalues .",
    "there is a clear trend that the minimum eigenvalues become larger for smaller lattice spacings .",
    "another interesting point is that the rg - improved action gives larger values of @xmath32 than the plaquette action , which indicates that the rg - improved action has a better chiral behavior .",
    "these trends are parallel to the features we noted for @xmath0 in sec .",
    "[ sec : m5q ] .",
    "the spectral density of @xmath25 is defined by @xmath33 where the summation is over the eigenvalues of @xmath25 .",
    "we are interested in the density of zero eigenvalues , @xmath34 , since we expect this quantity to be related to the existence of unit eigenvalue of the transfer matrix . to calculate this quantity",
    ", we adopt the accumulation method proposed in @xcite , which is based on the relation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the spectral density function for @xmath26 .",
    "we note that , for the small-@xmath37 expansion of @xmath38 in ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) , analyticity of @xmath39 at the origin is assumed .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : acc ] , we show typical examples of the accumulation @xmath38 from the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath26 for the case of the rg - improved action .",
    "results for @xmath34 obtained by a linear fitting following ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) , normalized by the string tension , are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhob ] .",
    "our results for @xmath34 for the plaquette action are consistent with the previous data by edwards _",
    "results for the rg - improved action show a similar @xmath40 dependence .",
    "a significant difference is that the rg - improved action leads to much smaller values of @xmath34 than the plaquette action , roughly by an order of magnitude .",
    "we have applied the accumulation method to estimate the spectral density at zero eigenvalue of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator , @xmath34 .",
    "we found that this method leads to non - zero values of @xmath34 at @xmath412 gev for both the plaquette and rg - improved actions .    at @xmath41 gev ,",
    "the non - zero result for @xmath34 is consistent with the finite @xmath0 in the large @xmath3 limit observed in @xcite with both the plaquette and rg - improved actions . at @xmath42 gev , while a consistency also holds with the plaquette action , there is an apparent contradiction for the case of the rg - improved action since @xmath0 seems to decay exponentially with @xmath3 for this case .    in the accumulation data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acc ] we observe that results are very noisy at @xmath20 ( 2  gev ) . since the fit results for @xmath34 fluctuates with volume , it is difficult to determine the size dependence .",
    "therefore simulations with larger lattices are needed to check if the slope remains non - vanishing toward infinite volume .",
    "another point to examine is if the analyticity assumption for @xmath39 at the origin is justified if there is a spectral gap .",
    "further studies are required to clarify these points .",
