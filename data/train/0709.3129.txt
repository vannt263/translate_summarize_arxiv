    "quantum optical technologies require photon states with specific spectral properties .",
    "for example , quantum information processing using linear optics is based upon the availability of pure - state single - photon wavepackets @xcite .",
    "single - photon wavepackets can be prepared using pair generation by means of spontaneous parametric downconversion ( pdc ) , or by spontaneous four wave mixing ( sfwm ) @xcite . in both cases individual photons",
    "are heralded by the detection of their siblings .",
    "the prepared photons will not normally be in pure states unless special care is taken to remove all correlations in every degree of freedom of the photon pairs , i.e. to make the two - photon state factorable@xcite .",
    "if this is not done , the heralded photons will be in mixed states , and therefore unsuitable for use in quantum logic gates , which rely on hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference between independent photons . typically , photon pairs generated in spontaneous processes exhibit significant spectral and spatial correlations due to the energy and momentum conservation constraints that are typical in parametric nonlinear optics .",
    "spatial correlations may be minimized by use of guided - wave configurations , such as those exploiting nonlinear waveguides and optical fibers@xcite .",
    "spectral correlations are , however , more difficult to eliminate .",
    "it is possible to eliminate all correlations in this degree of freedom for photon pairs generated by means of pdc , as first shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , and later extended in @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by the method of group - velocity matching using a broadband pump pulse . in this paper",
    "we generalize this method to the case of sfwm , by engineering the group velocities of the sideband photons using photonic crystal fibers ( pcfs ) .",
    "pcfs are comprised of a solid silica core surrounded by a silica cladding containing a regular array of air holes .",
    "this leads to an exceptionally high core - cladding index contrast , creating strong waveguide dispersion that can be tailored for a wide - range of applications @xcite .",
    "spontaneous four wave mixing occurs in single - mode fibers with a third - order optical nonlinearity . in this process",
    ", two pump photons are scattered from one or two distinct pump fields into a pair of fields , labeled signal and idler , which are spectrally and/or polarization distinct .",
    "the single - mode waveguide geometry leads to the suppression of correlations in the transverse momentum degree of freedom , as well as suppression of mixed spectral - transverse momentum correlations .",
    "thus , by imposing appropriate group velocity matching constraints on the sfwm process in a single - mode fiber , it becomes possible to eliminate correlations in _ all _ degrees of freedom , resulting in factorable two - photon states .",
    "previous experimental work has explored this type of source in a number of geometries including standard single - mode fiber and pcf .",
    "photon number correlations between signal and idler fields were first observed by pumping in the anomalous dispersion region @xcite , although there was a significant background of noise photons generated by raman scattering of the pump light @xcite .",
    "spontaneous raman scattering generates photons shifted to the red of the pump wavelength by up to 50 thz , corresponding to the frequency of an optical phonon in glass .",
    "thermal population of the phonons gives rise to scattering over a broad frequency range , and the process does not require phase matching , so it occurs at all pump wavelengths .",
    "photonic crystal fibers allow the signal and idler fields to be widely separated in frequency from the pump , so that raman noise at the lower - frequency photon wavelength is greatly reduced @xcite .",
    "phase - matching of sfwm with widely separated sidebands is enabled by pumping in the normal dispersion region , which requires the favorable dispersion properties of strongly guided waves @xcite .",
    "these experiments did not , however , address the requirement of purity for generating heralded single - photon states .",
    "in particular , the photons generated in those experiments would require tight spectral filtering to eliminate correlations between signal an idler frequencies prior to heralding .",
    "using such tight filtering ensures high - visibility hom interference between photons from separate sources , but greatly reduces the count rates . to avoid the need for filtering , the sfwm process must produce a state whose two - photon component can be written as the product of the signal state and the idler state , i.e.,@xmath2 , in the photon number basis with @xmath3 indicating signal and idler modes respectively .",
    "we call this property `` factorability , '' which corresponds to the absence of correlations between the frequencies ( and momenta ) of the idler and signal photons . in physical terms",
    ", factorability implies that no information about , say , the idler photon ( apart from its existence ) can be extracted from the detection of the signal photon , or vice - versa . to date , such factorable states have been produced only in pdc at a single wavelength using a particular crystal having special dispersion properties @xcite , and other techniques could in principle be used to extend possible operation wavelengths @xcite .",
    "we show here that factorability can be achieved at a much wider range of wavelengths by using pcf .",
    "in addition to factorability , pcf enables the production of a wide range of spectral correlations in the two - photon component of the state .",
    "two extremes are possible , a spectrally correlated state and a spectrally anti - correlated state .",
    "the former is a resource for quantum - enhanced quantum positioning @xcite , whereas the latter is of importance for applications relying on time - of - arrival differences between two optical modes , such as optical coherence tomography @xcite .",
    "we will show that the anti - correlated case can be made ultra - broadband by tailoring the higher - order dispersion .",
    "thus we see that the ability to engineer the dispersion in pcf leads to a flexible system that can generate states in two widely disparate regimes ( factorable and highly correlated ) , and indeed in a very general class of intermediate regimes .    in all these cases ,",
    "the light is produced in well - defined fiber modes , which is convenient for integration with waveguide devices .",
    "this holds the promise of combining many quantum logic gates using integrated optics , leading to the possibility of scalable quantum optical devices .",
    "in this paper we study sfwm in a single - mode optical fiber with a third - order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath0 . in this process , two - photons from pump fields @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "are jointly annihilated to create a photon pair comprised of one photon in the signal mode , @xmath6 , and one photon in the idler mode @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that all fields propagate in the fundamental spatial mode of the fiber .",

    "it has been pointed out in the fwm literature that birefringent fwm has the added benefit of reducing raman contamination in the signal and idler @xcite .",
    "recently this has also been forwarded  as a strategy to reduce background for pair - generation @xcite .",
    "raman gain @xmath234 is reduced by as much as an order of magnitude in the axis orthogonal to the strong pump pulse @xcite .",
    "however , the relevant @xmath0 for birefringent pair production is also reduced by a factor of three compared to co - polarized fwm @xcite . tripling the power @xmath235 to compensate , ref .",
    "@xcite studied the pair - correlation produced by the fiber , @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the intensity of signal or idler mode .",
    "they found that at the raman peak , @xmath238 was 7 for co - polarized sfwm as compared to 60 for cross - polarized sfwm , indicating that the cross - polarized case can be a higher quality photon - pair source .",
    "the flexibility afforded by pcfs in engineering the spectral correlations of photon pairs permits the generation of a wide class of states .",
    "for instance , this may be illustrated by considering the generation of quantum states in which the photon pair component has an extraordinarily high degree of frequency anti - correlation@xcite .",
    "the photons individually have an ultrabroad bandwidth , yet are very tightly anticorrelated in frequency , and highly correlated in time ( to the level of a single optical cycle ) .",
    "we have identified conditions for which ultra - broadband two - photon states can be generated in the degenerate pump regime by sfwm .",
    "such ultrabroad states have recently been generated by pdc @xcite . as pointed out above , for fiber geometries where the phase - matching diagram occurs in the form of loops ( which is true for most cases of interest ) , it is possible to obtain an arbitrary phase - matching orientation on @xmath80 space . by imposing constraints on higher dispersive orders ,",
    "it becomes possible to generate states with yet different character .",
    "in particular , in analogy with the generation of ultra - broadband two - photon states via pdc  @xcite , it can be shown that in the case of sfwm , the bandwidth of the generated light can be made particularly large if the fourth - order @xmath239 and second order @xmath240 coefficients vanish simultaneously . in this case",
    ", a degenerate pump at the zero - group - velocity - dispersion frequency can lead to a state with a remarkably broad bandwidth ( hundreds of nanometers ) , even for a nearly monochromatic pump .",
    "for example , for the pcf described previously with @xmath85 m and @xmath86 , whose phase - matching curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contordk ] , pumping at a frequency around @xmath241 rad / sec ( wavelength @xmath242 nm ) , where the curve is nearly vertical , would create photons with a bandwidth of around @xmath243 rad / sec ( @xmath244 nm ) centered at the pump frequency , depending on the bandwidth of the pump .",
    "previously , light produced by co - polarized pumps was shown to have a bandwidth of 50 nm for cw pumps @xcite and 100 nm for pulsed pumps @xcite . for cross - polarized cw pumps broadband light of 34 nm",
    "was produced @xcite .",
    "we have studied theoretically the spontaneous four wave mixing process in single mode photonic crystal fiber . we have shown that it is possible to design a source so as to yield photon pairs with a broad class of spectrally engineered properties , including factorable and ultrabroadband states .",
    "these results are achieved by adjusting the source configuration , including the dispersion ( determined by the core radius and air filling fraction ) and birefringence of the fiber and the pump frequency or frequencies , bandwidth(s ) and polarization(s ) .",
    "the flexibility of the two - photon state engineering arises from the interplay of this large number of control parameters .",
    "factorable signal - idler pair generation allows the production of heralded , high purity single - photon wavepackets , with minimal or no need for spectral filtering .",
    "factorable state generation is possible if certain group - velocity matching conditions are satisfied , in addition to standard phase - matching .",
    "most fibers ( all those for which the phase - matching curve occurs in loops ) can achieve all appropriate group - velocity matching conditions by suitable choice of the pump wavelength .",
    "this allows one to realize all possible orientations of the joint spectral amplitude of the generated photon pairs .",
    "the size of the phase - matching loop is largely determined by the dispersion of the fiber , hence the utility of pcfs .",
    "therefore we find that for specific choices of pump frequency most fiber designs can yield factorable states .",
    "this is in contrast with parametric downconversion in second - order nonlinear crystals where such conditions are met at best at isolated frequencies for certain materials , or using more complicated microstructures @xcite .",
    "an important design consideration is the possible contamination of the frequency sideband modes by photons from spontaneous raman scattering .",
    "this problem can be circumvented in part by cooling the fiber to cryogenic temperatures , thereby suppressing the raman scattering @xcite .",
    "we have shown how to circumvent the problem by exploiting a phase - matching configuration where the signal and the idler frequencies are widely separated from the pump frequency ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : contordk ] ) .",
    "if desired , the phase matching in non - birefringent fiber can be engineered to create photon pairs having one photon in the infrared and one photon in the visible .",
    "alternative approaches also discussed in this paper are cross - polarized fwm in birefringent fiber , where the pump and generated photons have orthogonal polarizations , and the use of non - degenerate pumps in a co - polarized regime .",
    "we have shown that these approaches lead to sources capable of generating factorable photon pairs where the signal and idler photons are both in the visible , and at the same time are both sufficiently separated from the pump frequency to avoid raman contamination .",
    "we expect these results to be useful in the design of sources for practical implementations of quantum information processing technologies .",
