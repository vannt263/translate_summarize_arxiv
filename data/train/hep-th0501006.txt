    "the quantity @xmath14 is defined by : @xmath15 where the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) are polynomials in @xmath10 and its @xmath11derivatives .",
    "they are related by a recursion relation : @xmath18 and are fixed by the constant @xmath19 , and the requirement that the rest vanish for vanishing @xmath20 .",
    "the first few are : @xmath21 the @xmath22th model is chosen by setting all the other @xmath23s to zero except @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , the latter being fixed to a numerical value such that @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27 are normalised such that the coefficient of @xmath28 is unity , _",
    "e.g. _ : @xmath29    for the @xmath22th model , equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) has asymptotics : @xmath30    the function @xmath10 defines the partition function @xmath31 of the string theory _ via _ :",

    "furnish the partition function perturbatively as an expansion in the dimensionless string coupling @xmath34 the role of @xmath1 is now clear : at large positive @xmath11 we find that @xmath1 controls the number of background d - branes since the perturbative series contains both open and closed string worldsheets with a factor of @xmath1 for each boundary ; while the large negative @xmath11 series gives only closed string worldsheets , with @xmath35 appearing when there is an insertion of pure r ",
    "r flux@xcite .    from the point of view of the @xmath22th theory ,",
    "the other @xmath25s represent coupling to closed string operators @xmath36 .",
    "it is well known that the insertion of each operator can be expressed in terms of the kdv flows@xcite : @xmath37 the operator @xmath38 couples to @xmath39 , which is in fact @xmath40 , the cosmological constant ( in the unitary model ) .",
    "so @xmath38 is often referred to as the puncture operator , which yields the area of a surface by fixing a point which is then integrated over in the path integral .",
    "so @xmath10 is the two  point function of the puncture operator .",
    "for @xmath41 the string equation ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) was discovered by defining a family of string theories using double scaled models of a complex matrix @xmath42 : @xmath43 the resulting physics captured by the string equation was the first complete non  perturbative definition of a string theory@xcite , sharing the large @xmath11 perturbation theory of the original ( bosonic ) string theories obtained by double scaling of hermitian matrix models@xcite , but not suffering from their non  perturbative shortcomings .",
    "non  zero @xmath1 can also be studied using a matrix model definition in a variety of ways .",
    "one way is to add a logarithmic term@xcite to an appropriate@xcite matrix model potential .",
    "expanding the logarithm clearly adds holes of all sizes to the string worldsheets defined by studying the duals of the feynman diagrams of the model .",
    "another ( equivalent ) method is to define @xmath42 as an @xmath44 rectangular matrix@xcite .",
    "the double scaling limit ( in which @xmath45 is taken large ) then yields equation ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) .",
    "it is clear from these two methods that , in the interpretation of the matrix model as the world ",
    "volume theory of @xmath45 d  branes ( which defines the closed string theory holographically@xcite after taking the double scaling limit ) , the modification corresponds to adding @xmath1 `` quark flavours '' to the world  volume model .",
    "this corresponds to adding sectors of open strings stretching between the @xmath45 d  branes and @xmath1 extra d  branes .",
    "so from this point of view it appears that @xmath1 is a positive integer .",
    "however , this is not at all clear from the string equation itself .",
    "in fact , it is known perturbatively that the solutions of the equation have special properties for various fractional values of @xmath1 . in the large negative @xmath11 regime of equation  ( [ eq : largez ] ) .",
    "there are several other interesting cases of this type , including a family of exact double pole solutions , for half ",
    "integer @xmath1 .",
    "see refs.@xcite . ]",
    "these might well turn out to be unphysical values , but this is not _  priori _ clear .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to show that @xmath1 being a positive integer is in fact selected out as special from the point of view of the string equation .",
    "we will do this by studying the equation non  perturbatively using numerical methods , and by also observing the properties of a natural transformation between solutions of the string equation which change @xmath1 by @xmath46 .",
    "this transformation was discovered in ref@xcite , and we derive an explicit form for it here , and employ this form in our investigations .",
    "we further observe that the transformation is in fact a specialisation ( to the scale invariant soliton sector ) of the bcklund transformations of the kdv hierarchy !",
    "these bcklund transformations are known to change the soliton number of solutions of the kdv equation ( and its higher order analogues)@xcite , and so our observation is particularly intriguing , since it implies that the ( localized@xcite ) d  branes of the minimal type  0a string theory _ are intimately connected with the solitons of the kdv hierarchy_.    * note : * while this paper was being written , a paper appeared@xcite which contains results that have some overlap with ours .",
    "a solution @xmath10 of the string equation serves as the potential for a one  dimensional hamiltonian @xmath47 which arises naturally in the double  scaled matrix model@xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 plays the role of @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , the ( first derivative of ) the string equation can be obtained by eliminating the wave ",
    "function @xmath51 from the equations : @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is a differential operator representing scale transformations .",
    "it is constructed from ( the differential operator part of ) fractional powers@xcite of @xmath54 , as follows@xcite : @xmath55 eliminating @xmath56 , one has the operator equation@xcite : @xmath57=q\\ , \\ ] ] which yields an equation for @xmath10 which is the first derivative of equation ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) .",

    " brane@xcite probe of the model , a fact which has been studied extensively recently for the bosonic string in ref.@xcite . ] .",
    "the problem is naturally defined in terms of the eigenvalues , @xmath58 , of the combination @xmath59 .",
    "these are naturally positive .",
    "so in the double scaling limit ( which focuses on the infinitesimal region near the tail of the eigenvalue distribution of the model ) the scaled eigenvalues , which we denote as @xmath60 , are also distributed on the positive real line .",
    "we verified this in the full non  perturbative regime by studying the spectrum of @xmath47 numerically . to do this",
    "we solved the differential equation for a given value of @xmath22 as a boundary value problem , with the perturbative boundary conditions given in equations  ( [ eq : largez ] ) .",
    "we started out by using the equation  solving routine dsolve in the package _",
    "maple 9 _ , although later we used other methods ( see below for the case of negative @xmath1 ) .",
    "we used a discrete @xmath11 lattice of up to @xmath61 points for positive @xmath1 .",
    "first , note the form of the function @xmath10 for some _ strictly positive _ values of @xmath1 ( see figure  [ fig : gammaplots ] ) .    ) for @xmath10 : _ ( a ) _ the case @xmath62 , and _ ( b ) _ the case @xmath63 , for a range of values of the parameter @xmath1 .",

    "a striking feature is the fact that the potential develops a potential well in the interior , as @xmath68 .",
    "it is therefore interesting and important to _ non  perturbatively _ establish these properties ( continuity , boundedness ) of the spectrum for various @xmath1 .",
    "first , we checked the spectrum of the case @xmath41 ( the case with no background branes ) , and verified that there are no bound states , despite the appearance of the well . ]",
    "solutions carried out extensively in refs.@xcite . ] .",
    "we set up the problem numerically by discretizing the spatial coordinate @xmath11 , typically using the interval @xmath69 , with @xmath70 .",
    "we used a range of lattice spacings in studying our problem to ensure stability .",
    "this was equivalent to a number of lattice points ranging from as little as 500 up to 10000 ( the latter used when more accuracy was needed , as we shall see later on . ) discretizing this problem turns it into a problem of diagonalizing a tri  diagonal matrix for which we coded a fairly efficient well  known method ( the tqli method@xcite ) in c@xmath71 to do the work .",
    "this allowed us to establish non  perturbatively with some confidence that there are no bound states in the well for positive @xmath1 , and so the spectrum is continuous and bounded from below by zero , in accord with perturbative expectations .",
    "the next step is the case of negative @xmath1 , which is clearly allowed by the equation and so should be studied .",
    "our first observation is that solving the differential equation numerically became much more prone to error , and we had to use much more accurate methods .",
    "we used the nag library of routines for solving boundary value problems with c@xmath71 to make further progress , as they gave much greater control over the problem .",
    "we were able to construct directly in this way a solution for @xmath10 for values as low as @xmath72 before running into numerical problems .",
    "see figure  [ fig : gammanegplots ] .    ) for @xmath10 in the case @xmath62 , for a range of negative values of the parameter @xmath1 : @xmath73 . ]",
    "once again we should check that the perturbative expectation that the spectrum is positive persists non  perturbatively .",
    "several solutions @xmath10 , for various @xmath1 down to @xmath74 were used as potentials for @xmath47 and found ( upon placing in our tridiagonal matrix diagonalization routine ) to have no bound states .    with these methods ,",
    "the growing instability is suggestive , but not compellingly so , that something interesting might be happening at @xmath3 .",
    "in order to establish this more satisfyingly we employed some exact methods ( in the form of a solution  generating transformation ) , which we will describe next .",
    "this will allow us to generate new @xmath10 from the ones we already can extract numerically , and allow us to approach @xmath3 in a controlled manner , and with convincing accuracy .",
    "in ref.@xcite , it was established that the double scaled unitary matrix models of refs.@xcite had an interpretation as continuum string theories with open string sectors .",
    "this was done by establishing a direct connection between the solutions of the string equations in equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) and solutions of the string equations for those unitary matrix models , which are most naturally written in terms of the quantities @xmath75 , where : @xmath76 - v r_k[v^2 + v^\\prime]\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as : @xmath77 + z v(z ) = \\nu c\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the models are organised by the mkdv hierarchy : @xmath78\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we define @xmath10 and @xmath79 such that : @xmath80 \\equiv \\frac12 \\mathcal{r}^\\prime [ u ] \\mp \\nu\\gamma - v(z)\\mathcal{r}[u ] = 0\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies a specific form for @xmath79 given a @xmath10 : @xmath81 \\mp \\nu\\gamma } { \\mathcal{r}[u]}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] noting the identity@xcite : @xmath82 x_{\\pm}^\\prime \\equiv ( v^2 + v^\\prime ) \\mathcal{r}^2 [ u ] - \\frac12 \\mathcal{r}[u ] \\mathcal{r}^{\\prime \\prime}[u ] + \\frac14 ( \\mathcal{r}^\\prime [ u])^2 - \\nu^2\\gamma^2\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that if the inverse transformation @xmath83 ( known in the integrable literature as the miura map ) exists , then this is just our original string equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) ; and on substitution into equation  ( [ eq : djmw-8 ] ) gives equation  ( [ eq : djmw-5 ] ) with @xmath84 .",
    "since the unitary matrix models of refs.@xcite were originally derived with @xmath85 , those models turn out to be identified with the case @xmath86 .",
    "since the transformation is true for both values of @xmath87 we find that a given @xmath10 for a value of @xmath1 gives two functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which must be related by : @xmath90 and hence : @xmath91}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , the string equation  ( [ eq : djmw-5 ] ) has the symmetry @xmath92 , and so we obtain a result which relates @xmath79 at one value of @xmath87 to another for @xmath93 : @xmath94}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this implies a similar transformation for functions @xmath10 , relating @xmath1 and @xmath95 .",
    "we can make this explicit by combining equations  ( [ eq : djmw-8 ] ) , ( [ eq : djmw-9 ] ) , ( [ eq : djmw-12 ] ) and @xmath96 to give the remarkable result : @xmath97 where @xmath98 .    in the theory of",
    "non  linear differential equations ( such as those encountered in the integrable model context ) bcklund transformations are extremely useful , since they convert a given solution of the differential equation into a new solution .",
    "strictly speaking , it looks rather like this is _ not _ what we have here since our string equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) is displayed with @xmath1 explicitly appearing , so @xmath99 and @xmath100 are solutions of _ different _ equations .",
    "however , the once  differentiated string equation ( which is in fact the one which appears naturally in many derivations ; see the beginning of the previous section , and see below ) , which is @xmath101 does not have an explicit appearance of @xmath1 .",
    "the solutions @xmath99 do know of @xmath1 , of course , since it appears ( for example ) in their asymptotic expansion  ( [ eq : largez ] ) .",
    "so we have a genuine bcklund transformation for our system .",
    "what is particularly interesting is that it is not just any such transformation but a special case of the well  known bcklund transformations known to change the number of solitons in the kdv hierarchy .",
    "we can make this explicit as follows :    we start with the kdv equations  ( [ eq : kdvflows ] ) , which we rewrite as : @xmath102 = \\left ( \\frac{1}{4 } { \\mathrm{d}}^3 -   { \\tilde u } { \\mathrm{d}}- \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{\\partial { \\tilde u}}{\\partial x } \\right ) r_k[{\\tilde u}]\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now @xmath103 .",
    "we can search for solutions of the form ; but we find that consistency forces us to choose @xmath104 . ]",
    "we then find @xmath106 and that ( under appropriate rescaling of @xmath25 ) equation  ( [ eq : kdv - gen ] ) becomes : @xmath107\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath108 .",
    "re  arranging we find the once  differentiated string equation  ( [ eq : nonpertdiff ] ) for a particular @xmath22 .",
    "this is another way of making the observation ( already noted in ref.@xcite ) that the string equation follows a restriction of the kdv hierarchy to scale invariant solutions .",
    "this also fits with the recovery@xcite of the string equation from the operator relation @xmath109=q$ ] , where @xmath110 is the generator of scale transformations = q$ ] formalism of ref.@xcite allows any arbitrary combination of the @xmath25s to be switched on at once . ] .",
    "( see the previous section . )",
    "now note that the kdv hierarchy admits the following well known bcklund transformation relating a solution @xmath111 to a solution @xmath112 : @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "this can be derived from the ( generalised ) miura map @xmath116 ( where @xmath117 is a constant ) , which relates the kdv and mkdv hierarchies , by noting that the mkdv flow hierarchy ( see equation  ( [ eq : djmw - flow ] ) ) is invariant under @xmath118 .",
    "so we can have two solutions of kdv , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , arising from the same solution , @xmath119 , of the mkdv hierarchy .",
    "we have @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which gives upon addition and subtraction : @xmath122 the latter can then be integrated once and substituted into the former to give equation  ( [ eq : back - with - lambda ] ) .",
    "this can then be specialized to solutions of the string equation by writing @xmath123 , which gives : @xmath124 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath108 .",
    "we have therefore @xmath125 so we see that for consistency we must set @xmath126 , which has an interesting interpretation to be discussed below .",
    "hence we have @xmath127 so far , it is not clear that this transformation changes @xmath1 . in order to establish the connection between this transformation and the one displayed in equation  ( [ eq : back - explicit - gam ] ) , in which @xmath1 appears explicitly , we first work perturbatively . starting with the asymptotic expansions  ( [ eq : largez ] ) , for ( say ) @xmath128 , it is easy to show that using equation  ( [ eq : back - without - lambda ] ) the asymptotic expansion obtained for @xmath129 is of the same form , except that @xmath1 has been replaced by @xmath95 .",
    "we then expect that they are equivalent non  perturbatively , and have checked that this is the case by working numerically on some explicit solutions .",
    "so we have established that the bcklund transformation takes us between solutions with asymptotics given in equation  ( [ eq : largez ] ) which are for @xmath1s differing from each other by unity .",
    "it is known@xcite that the bcklund transformations  ( [ eq : back - with - lambda ] ) of kdv increase or decrease the soliton number of a given solution by unity .",
    "in fact , for a given solution @xmath20 , the soliton corresponds to a bound state of @xmath47 with ( negative ) eigenvalue @xmath130 , and the speed of the soliton is given by @xmath131 ( up to a positive numerical constant ) .",
    "the soliton number of a particular solution can be read off by the number of such bound states and their individual velocities are set by the discrete spectrum .    in our case , we have established ( so far ) that there are no bound states in our solutions , and indeed , our restriction of the bcklund transformation forces @xmath132 .",
    "so we deduce from this that @xmath1 , which counts soliton number , must count the number of _ zero  velocity _ solitons .",
    "this is another sign that @xmath1 is naturally integer , and positive .",
    "this does not give solutions with the `` physical '' asymptotics given in equation  ( [ eq : largez ] ) , which is not a contradiction , since we did not start with such a solution .",
    "what one obtains are pole solutions with the half  integer values of @xmath1 similar to those discussed in refs.@xcite . ] .",
    "we will shortly find further evidence for this .    now that we have a method for generating new solutions @xmath10 starting from old ones",
    ", we can return to our numerical study armed with more powerful tools .",
    "we established in the last section that given a solution @xmath99 , we can generate a solution @xmath100 . in the section before , we reported that it was difficult to solve the string equation numerically as @xmath1 became more negative .",
    "numerical precision was lost rapidly as @xmath1 went below the value @xmath133 , while positive @xmath1 is very much under control .",
    "we can use our transformation from the previous section to surmount this obstacle , by simply solving the equation numerically for @xmath10 for @xmath134 , for @xmath135 small and positive , and then use our transformation  ( [ eq : back - explicit - gam ] ) to build a solution for @xmath10 with @xmath136 .",
    "we can simply follow @xmath135 to vanishingly small values and therefore learn the properties of @xmath10 on the approach to @xmath3 .",
    "we carried this out with very interesting results .",
    "see figure  [ fig : gammamorenegplots ] for examples .",
    "we were able to use this method to generate @xmath10 for @xmath136 where @xmath135 could easily be taken as small as @xmath137 .",
    "the potential well is observed to get more deep and narrow increasingly rapidly as @xmath138 .",
    "in fact , we observe numerically that the well runs to infinity along the line @xmath139 , becoming infinitely deep and narrow in the limit @xmath3 .    ) for @xmath10 in the case @xmath62 .",
    "the set of curves on the left shows @xmath10 for a range of negative values of the parameter @xmath1 , closely approaching the value @xmath140 from above .",
    "the curve with the lowest well ( very close to @xmath3 ) is beginning to show signs of numerical error to the right . the curve on the right is the case of @xmath141 , used for comparison in the text.,title=\"fig : \" ] ) for @xmath10 in the case @xmath62 .",
    "the set of curves on the left shows @xmath10 for a range of negative values of the parameter @xmath1 , closely approaching the value @xmath140 from above .",
    "the curve with the lowest well ( very close to @xmath3 ) is beginning to show signs of numerical error to the right . the curve on the right is the case of @xmath141 , used for comparison in the text.,title=\"fig : \" ]    most interestingly , note that since the deepening of the well is accompanied by a narrowing , the system has a chance of preventing the appearance of a dangerous bound state .",
    "we used the families of @xmath10 functions found here as potentials for @xmath47 and were indeed able to verify with some confidence ( to within acceptable error tolerance ) that there were no bound states present for any of the potentials .",
    "so the case @xmath3 is remarkably special , and in fact contains a surprise . at first",
    ", it seems that it develops a pathology , since as @xmath138 the well was seen to grow infinitely deep , but at the same time it became extremely narrow and , moreover , it moved off to infinity to the right .",
    "so the solution may in fact be well  behaved . in support of this , it is interesting to note the striking fact ( again , from studying families of curves such as those displayed in figure  [ fig : gammamorenegplots ] ) that in the limit the @xmath3 curve looks rather like the @xmath141 curve !",
    "the feature associated to the well is confined to a highly localized narrow ( and deep ) region , which has moved away .",
    "everything that remains of the @xmath3 curve at finite @xmath11 falls ( with considerable numerical accuracy ) on the @xmath141 curve .",
    "this numerical observation suggests the surprising result that the functions @xmath142 and @xmath143 are actually identical , and that the discrepancy from the piece at infinity actually disappears in the limit .",
    "we can prove this for all @xmath22 .",
    "the transformation  ( [ eq : back - explicit - gam ] ) can be used to generate either of these functions starting with the case of @xmath144 . putting this function and @xmath41 into the equation",
    "immediately gives the result that @xmath145 , since there is no explicit appearance of @xmath1 in the transformation in order to generate the difference between decreasing _ vs _ increasing  @xmath1 .",
    "note that below @xmath3 there is a transition to completely new behaviour .",
    "there , the system no longer has a smooth solution with the asymptotics given in equation  ( [ eq : largez ] ) , and there must be a singularity at _ finite _ @xmath11",
    ". the origin of the singularity can be seen ( for @xmath146 by considering the form of the transformation  ( [ eq : back - explicit - gam ] ) .",
    "the denominator of the transformation is @xmath147 , where , for large positive @xmath11 , we have that @xmath148 and so for @xmath149 , the @xmath62 solution must approach the line @xmath150 from below as @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath10 started out above this line ( at @xmath66 ) , it must be that it crosses the line somewhere in the interior . if this is the case , then somewhere in the interior , the new solution @xmath151 must have a singularity , since the denominator vanishes there .",
    "we expect similar arguments to hold for the negative @xmath1 behaviour of other values of @xmath22 .",
    "so we have the very natural physical situation singling out @xmath1 as a positive integer , since any solution @xmath10 with @xmath152 can be used as a seed for our transformation  ( [ eq : back - explicit - gam ] ) to generate a @xmath10 solution with poles , which have a problematic interpretation .",
    "furthermore , any solution @xmath10 for a positive fractional value of @xmath1 can also be used , by applying the transformation successively , to generate such solutions , and so they are in the same class as the @xmath152 solutions .",
    "the @xmath10 for positive integer values of @xmath1 are therefore special , in that they are not connected by our transformation to any solutions with poles .",
    "so we see that studying the string equation non  perturbatively using a combination of exact and numerical methods reveals that the solutions have non  perturbative sensitivity to the values of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , it appears that for @xmath153 , the spectrum of the model is continuous and bounded from below by zero , which is consistent with perturbative expectations .",
    "this means , for example , that the wavefunction of the extended brane@xcite probe@xcite , the wavefunction @xmath56 of @xmath47 , thought of as a function @xmath154 has connected support .    for @xmath155 , the system does not seem to maintain a continuous , bounded spectrum",
    "@xmath156 is a special value therefore , marking the beginning of a new phase of the model .",
    "it is tempting to think of this as a phase transition , but since we have every reason to think of @xmath1 as a discrete parameter , this is probably not well motivated .",
    "we are able to reach all positive integer values of @xmath1 using our special bcklund transformation , and we observe that the cases of @xmath1 being a negative integer do not really exist , since @xmath3 is the same as @xmath141 , so successive application of the transformation will not generate any new negative integer cases . so the positive integer @xmath1 solutions constitute a very special set . meanwhile fractional values of @xmath1 can be connected by the transformation to solutions with poles , and so seem less physical .",
    "so while we have not rigourously proven that the positive integers are the only physical values selected by the string equation , it is certainly encouraging to find that the equation has properties that single out the positive integers as special .",
    "this connects rather nicely to the rectangular matrix model understanding of the role of @xmath1 mentioned in the first section : if @xmath42 is `` row  like '' ( @xmath157 ) , then the combination @xmath158 will have @xmath159 eigenvalues , and precisely @xmath1 of them are zero .",
    "these @xmath1 extra zeros correspond to the zero  velocity kdv solitons ( see below ) . on the other hand , if the matrix @xmath42 is a `` column  like '' ( @xmath160 ) rectangular matrix ( _ i.e. , _ more columns than rows ) then the combination @xmath158 will have @xmath161 eigenvalues .",
    "so negative @xmath1 has no extra zero eigenvalues , and does not correspond to having any background branes .",
    "in fact it seems to reduce the number of eigenvalues of the matrix , but at large @xmath45 ( the limit in which we have defined the continuun model ) this makes no difference .",
    "it would be interesting to determine what the negative @xmath1 regime may mean physically as corresponding to adding @xmath1 anti  branes can not be correct ( we thank nathan seiberg for a comment about this ) , particularly in view of our observation about the non  existence of a distinct branch of solutions for @xmath10 in this regime . ] .",
    "this regime presumably has a plethora of bound states , which would need to given a physical interpretation .",
    "perhaps it is simply not possible to do so , and so the development of singularities in @xmath10 for fractional @xmath1 would be indicative of a non  perturbative sickness , reminiscent of that of the even @xmath22 bosonic models@xcite .",
    "the observation that there are @xmath1 extra zero eigenvalues for positive integer @xmath1 fits very well with the fact that our specialization of the bcklund transformations creates and destroys kdv solitons with spectral parameter @xmath162 .",
    "it is clear that the localized d  branes of the minimal string theory should be identified with these solitons .",
    "this direct connection of d  branes with the solitons of the underlying integrable system is intriguing and may well lead to interesting new physics in both string theory and in the theory of integrable systems .",
    "it deserves further investigation .",
