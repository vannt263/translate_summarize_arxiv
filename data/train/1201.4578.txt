    "the use of periodic potentials , induced by optical lattices , for steering matter waves in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) is a vast research area , as demonstrated in reviews @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an important aspect of this topic is that the lattice potentials , balancing the cubic nonlinearities induced by inter - atomic collisions in the bec , help to create and stabilize solitons .",
    "in particular , the lattices play a critical role in stabilizing two - dimensional ( 2d ) solitons against the collapse in the condensate with intrinsic self - attraction @xcite .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies of the soliton dynamics in periodic potentials were recently extended for _ nonlinear lattices _ ( nls ) , which may be induced by a spatially periodic modulation of the local strength of  the nonlinearity ( the respective effective nonlinear potentials are often called _ pseudopotentials _",
    "@xcite ) . in bec",
    ", the spatial modulation can be implemented by means of the feshbach resonance controlled by properly patterned external fields ( in the quasi-1d bec , a combination of linear and nonlinear lattices may also be induced by periodically modulating the strength of the tight transverse confinement in the axial direction @xcite ) . as well as",
    "their linear counterparts , nls have drawn much attention in connection to their potential for the creation and control of matter - wave solitons in a number of different settings , see original works @xcite-@xcite and review @xcite .",
    "while nls readily support stable 1d solitons @xcite-@xcite , it has been found difficult , albeit sometimes possible , to stabilize 2d solitons against the collapse by means of the nl - induced pseudopotentials @xcite . as concerns the 1d solitons in models with the cubic nonlinearity",
    ", the numerical analysis also reveals that they feature mobility in the presence of nls @xcite .",
    "thus far , no example of stabilization of 3d solitons by nls has been reported . on the other hand",
    ", the creation of multidimensional solitons can be facilitated by combinations of linear and nonlinear lattices , as shown , in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where 2d solitons supported by crossed 1d lattices , one linear and one nonlinear , were reported .",
    "still earlier , it was demonstrated that the 1d linear - lattice potential , acting together with periodic temporal modulations of the nonlinearity , which may be induced by the feshbach resonance controlled by a time - periodic external field , can stabilize 3d solitons @xcite .",
    "a natural possibility for the creation of 3d solitons is suggested by a combination of the 1d nl with the usual harmonic - oscillator linear trapping potential acting in the plane perpendicular to the nl axis ( similar settings , but with linear 1d lattices , were shown to be efficient in the creation of 3d gap solitons in the bec with the repulsive intrinsic nonlinearity @xcite ) .",
    "this setting is the subject of the present paper .",
    "we tackle it by means of two different methods , namely , the variational approximation ( va )  applied to the underlying 3d gross - pitaevskii equation , and , in a more accurate form , the effective 1d nonpolynomial schrdinger equation ( npse ) , which was efficient in description of many other settings dominated by the interplay of the tight 2d confinement and nonlinearity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , including the action of linear lattice potentials in the axial direction @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider a dilute bec of bosons with mass @xmath0 confined in the transverse plane by the isotropic harmonic - oscillator potential with frequency @xmath1 , @xmath2",
    ". the corresponding 3d gross - pitaevskii equation is rescaled by measuring time and coordinates in units of @xmath3 and the transverse - confinement radius , @xmath4 , respectively ( hence the energy is measured in units of @xmath5 ) : @xmath6 \\psi , \\label{3dgpe}\\]]with the condensate s wave function normalized to unity , @xmath7the interaction strength in eq .",

    "placing the center of the soliton at @xmath14 , we assume @xmath15 , to support the soliton by the locally attractive nonlinearity .    the 1d periodic modulation of the local scattering length , implied by eqs .",

    "more often , the feshbach resonance in experiments with bec is controlled by the magnetic field @xcite . in that case , the 1d periodic structure can be built as a magnetic lattice , imposed by a properly designed set of ferromagnet films @xcite , with the respective fabrication limit on the nl period also amounting to @xmath16 @xmath18 m .",
    "then , assuming that the trapping potential confines the transverse size of the condensate , as usual , to the same order of magnitude ( a few microns ) , one may conclude that the solitons are built of several thousand atoms @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the direct va is developed in section ii , and the effective 1d npse is derived in section iii .",
    "in both cases , we find the stability region for solitons in the plane of @xmath19 . the mobility of the solitons is tested in section iii by means of direct simulations of the evolution of axially kicked solitons , in the framework of the npse ( it is concluded that the solitons are not mobile in the present setting ; however , the kick may effectively stabilize solitons against the collapse ) .",

    "we have reported results for 3d matter - wave solitons supported by a combination of the axial 1d nl ( nonlinear lattice ) , which periodically reverses the sign of the nonlinear interaction , and the tightly trapping harmonic - oscillator potential acting in the transverse plane .",
    "the results were obtained by means of two distinct approaches : the va ( variational approximation ) , which was applied directly to the 3d gross - pitaevskii equation , and the 1d npse , that was derived from the underlying 3d equation .",
    "previous works did not study the stabilization of 3d solitons by nls .",
    "the main result , produced by means of both methods in similar forms , is the stability domain for solitons in the plane of the nl strength and wavenumber .",
    "the usual 1d cubic gross - pitaevskii equation with the nl can not produce adequate results , as it does not give rise to the collapse , which is the most important stability - limiting factor .",
    "another essential difference of the solitons produced by the npse with the nl from their counterparts in the case of the cubic nl is that the solitons are immobile in the framework of the npse : the kick applied to the soliton either leaves it pinned , or , eventually , destroys it .",
    "the critical size of the kick which destroys the soliton was found to be proportional to the strength of the nl , provided that the strength is large enough ; an explanation for this dependence was proposed . on the other hand , the kick ,",
    "if applied to the wave packet created above the collapse threshold , may help it to shed off the excess norm and thus stabilize itself against the collapse . a related dynamical effect , which demonstrates the difference of the nls from linear lattices , is that wave packets relaxing into solitons can emit small - amplitude waves , which freely propagate in the system .",
    "a challenging extension of the analysis may be to develop it for the setting with a 2d nl and the 1d trapping potential acting in the transverse direction .",
    "the 2d version of the npse was developed previously , but in the absence of the nl @xcite . in this case , one may expect the existence of both fundamental and vortical 2d solitons .",

    "<S> we consider the three - dimensional ( 3d ) mean - field model for the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , with a 1d nonlinear lattice ( nl ) , which periodically changes the sign of the nonlinearity along the axial direction , and the harmonic - oscillator trapping potential applied in the transverse plane . the lattice can be created as an optical or magnetic one , by means of available experimental techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the objective is to identify stable 3d solitons supported by the setting . </S>",
    "<S> two methods are developed for this purpose : the variational approximation , formulated in the framework of the 3d gross - pitaevskii equation , and the 1d nonpolynomial schrdinger equation ( npse ) in the axial direction , which allows one to predict the collapse in the framework of the 1d description . </S>",
    "<S> results are summarized in the form of a stability region for the solitons in the plane of the nl strength and wavenumber . </S>",
    "<S> both methods produce a similar form of the stability region . unlike their counterparts supported by the nl in the 1d model with the cubic nonlinearity , kicked solitons of the npse can not be set in motion , but the kick may help to stabilize them against the collapse , by causing the solitons to shed excess norm . </S>",
    "<S> a dynamical effect specific to the nl is found in the form of freely propagating small - amplitude wave packets emitted by perturbed solitons . </S>"
