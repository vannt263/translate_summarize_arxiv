    "knowing the dynamical properties and the overall orbital structure of galaxies is an issue of paramount importance .",
    "therefore , scientists in an attempt to explore and interpret their structure , they usually build and apply galactic dynamical models , which in most cases are mathematical expressions giving either the potential or the mass density of the galaxy , as a function of the radius @xmath1 from the center .",
    "the reader can find a variety of interesting models , describing motion in galaxies in [ @xcite ] .",
    "moreover , potential density pairs for galaxies were also presented by [ @xcite ] . over the last years",
    ", several types of galactic models have been proposed in an attempt to model the orbital properties in axially symmetric systems .",
    "a simple yet realistic axisymmetric logarithmic potential was introduced in [ @xcite ] for the description of galactic haloes at which the mass density drops like @xmath2 [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , the most well - known model for cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes is the flattened cuspy nfw model [ @xcite,@xcite ] , where the density at large radii falls like @xmath3 .",
    "this model being self - consistent has a major advantage and that s why it is mainly used for conducting @xmath4-body simulations .    in order to obtain the mass profiles of galaxies",
    ", we have to use dynamical models describing the main properties of the galaxies .",
    "these models can be generated by deploying two main techniques : ( i ) using superposition of libraries of orbits ( e.g. , [ @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ] ) or ( ii ) using distributions functions ( e.g. , [ @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ] ) . in the literature",
    "there are also other more specialized dynamical models combining kinematic and photometric data .",
    "for instance , axially symmetric schwarzschild models were used by [ @xcite ] , while [ @xcite ] used jeans models in order to fit observational data in the x - ray potential introduced by [ @xcite ] .",
    "furthermore , axisymmetric schwarzschild models were also used by [ @xcite ] to fit data derived from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .    over the last years ,",
    "schwarzschild s superposition method [ @xcite ] has been heavily utilized by several researchers ( e.g. , [ @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ] ) in order to model dark matter distributions in elliptical galaxies therefore , we deem it is necessary to recall and describe briefly in a few words the basic points of this interesting method .",
    "initially , @xmath4 closed cells define the configuration space , while @xmath5 orbits extracted from a given mass distribution construct the phase space .",
    "then , integrating numerically the equations of motion , we calculate the amount of time spent by each particular orbit in every cell .",
    "thus , the mass of each cell is directly proportional to the total sum of the stay times of orbits in every cell . using this technique",
    ", we manage to compute the unknown weights of the orbits , assuming they are not negative .",
    "spherical analytical models describing the motion of stars in galaxies were studied by ( e.g. , [ @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ] ) . moreover ,",
    "interesting axially symmetric galactic models were presented by [ @xcite ] .",
    "recently , [ @xcite ] used data derived from rotation curves of real galaxies , in order to construct a new axially symmetric model describing star motion in both elliptical and disk galaxy systems .    of particular interest ,",
    "are the so - called composite galactic dynamical models . in those models",
    "the potential has several terms each one describing a distinct component of the stellar system .",
    "such a dynamical model with four components , that is a disk , a nucleus , a bulge and a dark halo was studied by [ @xcite ] .",
    "a new composite mass model describing motion in axially symmetric galaxies with dark matter was recently presented and studied by [ @xcite ] .",
    "composite axially symmetric galaxy models describing the orbital motion in our galaxy were also studied by [ @xcite ] . in these models ,",
    "the gravitational potential is generated by three superposed disks : one representing the gas layer , one the thin disk and one representing the thick disk .    in a previous work [ @xcite ]",
    ", we introduced a new dynamical model describing three - dimensional motion in non axially symmetric galaxies .",
    "this model covers a wide range of galaxies from a disk system to an elliptical galaxy by suitably choosing the dynamical parameters .",
    "it was found , that the parameter which describes and controls the deviation from axially symmetry is indeed very influential both in the disk and the elliptical galaxy models . in the same vein",
    ", we proposed in [ @xcite,@xcite ] two analytical models describing the main body of a disk or an elliptical galaxy which contains dark matter . in the first model [ @xcite ] for the main body of the galaxy we used a mass potential , while in the second model [ @xcite ] it was described by a logarithmic potential .",
    "the fractional portion of the dark matter in the main body of the galaxy is regulated by a parameter and our numerical calculations suggested that in both models this parameter plays a key role to the overall orbital structure of the system .",
    "therefore , taking into account all the above there is no doubt , that modelling galaxies is an issue of great importance . on this basis",
    ", it seems of particular interest to build an analytical axially symmetric dynamical model describing the motion of stars in disk galaxies with non spherical and massive nuclei and also explore , how the deviation from axially symmetry of the central nucleus , being prolate or oblate , affects the regular or chaotic character of orbits as well as the behavior of the different families of orbits .",
    "similar research preformed in [ @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ] , where the effects of a central , spherical mass component in a galaxy were investigated .",
    "the present article is organized as follows : in section [ galmod ] we present in detail the structure and the properties of our gravitational galactic model . in section [ compmeth ]",
    "we describe the computational methods we used in order to determine the character of orbits . in the following section ,",
    "we investigate how the flattening parameter of the central non spherical nucleus influences the character of the orbits .",
    "the next section is devoted to some additional findings of our investigation regarding the reliability of chaos indicators .",
    "our paper ends with section [ disc ] , where the discussion and the conclusions of this research are presented .",
    "in this work , we use an axially symmetric disk galaxy model with an additional non spherical nucleus in order to investigate how the deviation from spherical symmetry of the central nucleus influences the regular or chaotic character of orbits in the meridional plane @xmath0 .",
    "we shall use the usual cylindrical coordinates @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the axis of symmetry .",
    "the total potential @xmath8 in our model is the sum of a disk potential @xmath9 and a central non spherical component @xmath10 .",
    "the first part is a generalization of the miyamoto - nagai potential [ @xcite ] ( see also [ @xcite,@xcite ] ) @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the gravitational constant , @xmath13 is the mass of the disk , @xmath14 represents the core radius of the disk - halo , while the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to the horizontal and vertical scale length of the disk respectively .    for the description of the central non spherical nucleus",
    "we introduce the following potential @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the nucleus , @xmath19 is the scale length of the nucleus ( acting also as a softening parameter ) , while @xmath20 is the flattening parameter .",
    "this model is somehow a combination of two well known galaxy models : ( a ) the plummer model [ @xcite ] and ( b ) the hernquist s model [ @xcite ] . at this point",
    ", we must make clear that eq .",
    "( [ vn ] ) is not intended to represent the potential of a black hole nor that of any other compact object , but just the potential of a dense and massive nucleus thus , we do not include relativistic effects .",
    "we use a system of galactic units , where the unit of length is 1 kpc , the unit of mass is @xmath21 and the unit of time is @xmath22 yr . the velocity unit is 10 km / s , the unit of angular momentum ( per unit mass ) is 10 km kpc@xmath23 s@xmath23 , while @xmath12 is equal to unity .",
    "finally , the energy unit ( per unit mass ) is 100 km@xmath24s@xmath25 . in these units ,",
    "the values of the involved parameters are : @xmath26 ( corresponding to 1.74 @xmath27 @xmath28 m@xmath29 ) , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( corresponding to 9.3 @xmath27 @xmath34 m@xmath29 ) and @xmath35 .",
    "the values of the disk and the nucleus were chosen having in mind a milky way - type galaxy ( e.g. , [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "the flattening parameter @xmath20 , on the other hand , is treated as a parameter and its value varies in the interval @xmath36 . the flattening parameter controls the particular shape of the central non spherical nucleus .",
    "in particular , when @xmath37 the nucleus is prolate , when @xmath38 is spherical , while when @xmath39 is oblate .",
    "of the galactic model ( black ) .",
    "we can also distinguish the contributions from the disk ( green ) and that of the central non spherical nucleus ( red ) . ]     where negative density appears for the first time , as a function of the flattening parameter @xmath20 . ]    in disk galaxies the circular velocity in the galactic plane @xmath40 , @xmath41 is a physical quantity of great importance . inserting the total potential @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ cvel ] ) we obtain @xmath42 a plot of @xmath43 as a function of the radius @xmath1 from the galactic center is presented in fig .",
    "[ rotvel ] , as a black curve .",
    "furthermore , in the same plot the green curve is the contribution from the disk , while the red line corresponds to the contribution of the non spherical nucleus .",
    "it is seen , that at small radii from the galactic center , @xmath44 kpc , the contribution from the central nucleus dominates , while at larger distances , @xmath45 kpc , the disk contribution is the dominant factor .",
    "we also observe , the characteristic local minimum of the rotation curve due to the massive nucleus , which appears at small values of @xmath1 , when fitting observed data to a galactic model [ @xcite,@xcite ] .",
    "it is very useful to compute the mass density @xmath46 derived from the total potential @xmath8 using the poisson s equation @xmath47 remember , that due to the axial symmetry the third term in eq .",
    "( [ dens ] ) is zero . if we set @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ dens ] ) we obtain the mass density on the galactic plane which is @xmath49 where @xmath50 in the following fig .",
    "[ denevol](a - b ) we present the evolution of @xmath51 as a function of the of the radius @xmath1 from the galactic center , for three values of the flattening parameter @xmath20 . in the same diagram ,",
    "the red line correspond to @xmath52 , the blue curve to @xmath38 , while the green line corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "it is evident , that the mass density decreases rapidly obtaining very low values with increasing radius @xmath1 .",
    "we also observe , that when @xmath54 kpc all three curves coincide , suggesting that the evolution of the mass density at large radii is the same regardless the particular value of the flattening parameter .",
    "according to our numerical calculations , at large galactocentric distances the non spherical nucleus is the dominant component therefore , the mass density should varies like @xmath55 .    here",
    "we must clarify , that the mass density @xmath46 in our galaxy model obtains negative values when the distance from the centre of the galaxy described by the model exceeds a minimum distance @xmath56 , which strongly depends on the flattening parameter @xmath20 .",
    "[ deneg ] shows a plot of the evolution of @xmath57 as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "we see , that even at the extreme values of the flattening parameter , that is when @xmath52 or @xmath53 , the first indication of negative density occurs only when @xmath58 kpc , that is almost at the theoretical boundaries of a real galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "when the central nucleus is spherical @xmath38 , the negative values of density tend to infinity , as expected .",
    "moreover , we must point out , that our gravitational potential is truncated ar @xmath59 kpc for both reasons : ( i ) otherwise the total mass of the galaxy modeled by this potential would be infinite , which is obviously not physical and ( ii ) to avoid the existence of negative values of density .",
    "taking into account that the total potential @xmath8 is axisymmetric , the @xmath7-component of the angular momentum @xmath60 is conserved . with this restriction , orbits can be described by means of the effective potential @xmath61 the @xmath62 term represents a centrifugal barrier ; only orbits with sufficient small @xmath60 are allowed to pass near the axis of symmetry .",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) motion is thus effectively reduced to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) motion in the meridional plane @xmath0 , which rotates non - uniformly around the axis of symmetry according to @xmath63 where of course the dot indicates derivative with respect to time .",
    "the equations of motion on the meridional plane are @xmath64 while the equations describing the evolution of a deviation vector @xmath65 which joins the corresponding phase space points of two initially nearby orbits , needed for the calculation of the standard chaos indicators ( the fli and sali in our case ) are given by the variational equations @xmath66    consequently , the corresponding hamiltonian to the effective potential given in eq .",
    "( [ veff ] ) can be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the momenta per unit mass , conjugate to @xmath1 and @xmath7 respectively , while @xmath70 is the numerical value of the hamiltonian , which is conserved .",
    "therefore , an orbit is restricted to the area in the meridional plane satisfying @xmath71 .",
    "in our study , an issue of paramount importance is knowing whether an orbit is regular or chaotic .",
    "several chaos indicators are available in the literature ; we chose two of them , namely the fast lyapunov indicator ( fli ) and the smaller alignment index ( sali ) . to compute these indicators , we integrated , along with each orbit , its corresponding variational equations ( [ vareq ] ) from unitary displacements in each of the cartesian directions of the phase space @xmath72 of the meridional plane .",
    "the fli [ @xcite,@xcite ] is known as a very fast , reliable and effective tool , which is defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a deviation vector . for distinguishing between regular and chaotic motion ,",
    "we need to compute the fli for a relatively short time interval of numerical integration @xmath75 .",
    "in particular , we track simultaneously the time - evolution of the orbit itself as well as one deviation vector @xmath74 in order to compute the fli . the variational equations ( [ vareq ] ) , as usual , are used for the evolution of the deviation vector .",
    "the particular time - evolution of the fli allow us to distinguish between regular and chaotic motion as follows : when an orbit is regular the fli exhibits a linear increase , while on the other hand , in the case of chaotic orbits the fli increases super - exponentially .",
    "unfortunately , this qualitative criterion is applicable only when someone wants to check the character of individual orbits by plotting and then inspecting by eye the evolution of fli .",
    "nevertheless , we can easily overtake this drawback by establishing a numerical threshold value , in order to quantify the results of fli .",
    "a generally accepted threshold is the value 10 .",
    "hence , in order to decide whether an orbit is regular or chaotic , one may apply the usual method according to which we check after a certain and predefined time interval of numerical integration , if the value of fli has become greater than the established threshold value .",
    "therefore , if fli @xmath76 the orbit is chaotic , while if fli @xmath77 the orbit is regular .",
    "the time - evolution of a regular ( r ) and a chaotic ( c ) orbit for a time period of @xmath78 time units is presented in fig .",
    "[ fsevol]a .    for the computation of the sali [ @xcite ]",
    ", one has to follow simultaneously the time - evolution of the orbit itself as well as two deviation vectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which initially point in two arbitrary directions . as usual ,",
    "the evolution of the deviation vectors is given by the variational equations ( [ vareq ] ) .",
    "moreover , taking into account that in this case we are only interested in the directions of these two deviation vectors , we normalize them at every time step of the numerical integration , thus keeping always their norm equal to unity . by applying this technique ,",
    "we manage to control the exponential growth of the norm of the deviation vectors and we also avoid overflow malfunctions .",
    "especially , when we deal with chaotic orbits the normalized deviation vectors point always to the very same direction and therefore , become equal or opposite in sign .",
    "thus , the sali can be obtained as @xmath81 where of course @xmath82 is the time , while @xmath83 denotes the euclidean norm . by definition",
    "applies that @xmath84 $ ] and when sali = 0 the two normalized deviation vectors are equal or opposite , nevertheless pointing to the same direction .",
    "it is the unique properties of the time - evolution of the sali that allow us to distinguish between regular and chaotic motion as follows : in the case of regular orbits the sali exhibits small fluctuations around a non - zero value , while on the other hand , in the case of chaotic orbits after a small transient period it tends exponentially to zero approaching the limit of the accuracy of the computer @xmath85 . in fig . [",
    "fsevol]b we see the time - evolution of a regular ( r ) and a chaotic ( c ) orbit for a time period of @xmath78 time units .",
    "generally speaking , two different initial deviation vectors become tangent to different directions on the torus , thus producing different sequences of vectors leading the sali always to fluctuates around positive values . on the contrary , for chaotic orbits ,",
    "any two initially different deviation vectors in time always tend to align in the direction defined by the maximal lyapunov characteristic number ( mlcn ) ( e.g. , [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "therefore , they either coincide with each other or become opposite , which forces the sali to decrease rapidly to zero .",
    "thus , we can exploit this completely different behaviour of the sali in order to discriminate between regular and chaotic motion in hamiltonian systems of any dimensionality .    in order to investigate the orbital properties ( chaoticity or regularity ) of the dynamical system , we need to establish some sample of initial conditions of orbits . the best approach , undoubtedly , would have been , if we could extract these sample of orbits from the distribution function of the model .",
    "unfortunately , this is not available so , we followed another course of action .",
    "for determining the chaoticity of our models , we chose , for each set of values of the flattening parameter , a dense grid of initial conditions in the @xmath86 phase plane , regularly distributed in the area allowed by the value of the energy @xmath70 .",
    "the points of the grid were separated 0.1 units in @xmath1 and 0.5 units in @xmath68 direction . for each initial condition",
    ", we integrated the equations of motion ( [ eqmot ] ) as well as the variational equations ( [ vareq ] ) with a double precision bulirsch - stoer algorithm ( e.g. , [ @xcite ] ) with a small time step of order of @xmath87 , which is sufficient enough for the desired accuracy of our computations ( i.e. our results practically do not change by halving the time step ) . in all cases , the energy integral ( eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) ) was conserved better than one part in @xmath88 , although for most orbits it was better than one part in @xmath89 .",
    "each orbit was integrated numerically for a time interval of @xmath78 time units ( 10 billion yr ) , which corresponds to a time span of the order of hundreds of orbital periods but of the order of one hubble time .",
    "the particular choice of the total integration time is an element of great importance , especially in the case of the so called  sticky orbits \" ( i.e. , chaotic orbits that behave as regular ones during long periods of time )",
    ". a sticky orbit could be easily misclassified as regular by any chaos indicator , if the total integration interval is too small , so that the orbit does not have enough time in order to reveal its true chaotic character .",
    "thus , all the sets of the grids of the initial conditions of orbits were integrated , as we already said , for @xmath78 time units , thus avoiding sticky orbits with a stickiness at least of the order of a hubble time .",
    "all the sticky orbits which do not show any signs of chaoticity for @xmath78 time units are counted as regular ones , since that vast sticky periods are completely out of scope of our research .",
    "a characteristic example of a sticky orbit ( s ) in our galactic system can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fsevol](a - b ) , where the horizontal , blue , dashed lines corresponds to the threshold values which separate regular from chaotic motion .",
    "we observe , that according to the usual threshold values the chaotic character of this particular sticky orbit is revealed after about 3000 time units using the fli method and only after about 3500 time units when the sali method is used .",
    "to classify an orbit as regular or chaotic by using either the fli or the sali , a threshold value should be established separating both types of orbits . however",
    ", this is a delicate issue , as these thresholds are generally obtained by some statistical procedure , or even by eye inspection of plots of the time - evolution of indicators versus time . besides , whereas the results of different chaos indicators agree in general , there are also the sticky orbits , that may be misclassified by one or another method depending of the threshold value used .",
    "we established the thresholds by taking advantage of our simultaneous computation of two chaos indicators : after the set of orbits of a grid has been integrated and the fli and sali were computed , we looked for those values of the thresholds that maximised the agreement in the classification of both methods .",
    "we found the threshold values which leave less than 1% of orbits per grid differently classified by both methods .",
    "a more thorough description regarding the issue of the reliability of chaos indicators and the corresponding threshold values is given in section [ fastindi ] .",
    "it is worth noticing , that in a previous work [ @xcite ] we used the exact same procedure dealing with mlcn and sali , while on the other hand , [ @xcite ] used a similar combination of mlcn and sali , although they supplemented those indicators by adding the computation of the variation with time of the fundamental frequencies of the orbits , and they did not combine the indicators to establish their thresholds .",
    "a first step towards the understanding of the overall behavior of our galactic system is knowing the regular or chaotic nature of orbits .",
    "of particular interest , however , is also the distribution of regular orbits into different families .",
    "therefore , once the orbits have been characterized as regular or chaotic , we then further classified the regular orbits into different families , by using the frequency analysis of [ @xcite,@xcite ] .",
    "initially , [ @xcite,@xcite ] proposed a technique , dubbed spectral dynamics , for this particular purpose . later on , this method has been extended and improved by [ @xcite ] and [ @xcite ] . in a recent work , [ @xcite ]",
    "the algorithm was refined even further , so it can be used to classify orbits in the meridional plane . in general terms , this method calculates the fourier transform of the coordinates of an orbit , identifies its peaks , extracts the corresponding frequencies and search for the fundamental frequencies and their possible resonances .",
    "thus , we can easily identify the various families of regular orbits and also recognize the secondary resonances that bifurcate from them .    before closing this section",
    ", we would like to make a short note about the nomenclature of orbits .",
    "all the orbits of an axisymmetric potential are in fact three - dimensional ( 3d ) loop orbits , i.e. , orbits that rotate around the axis of symmetry always in the same direction .",
    "however , in dealing with the meridional plane the rotational motion is lost , so the path that the orbit follows onto this plane can take any shape , depending on the nature of the orbit .",
    "we will call an orbit according to its behaviour in the meridional plane .",
    "thus , if for example an orbit is a rosette lying in the equatorial plane of the axisymmetric potential , it will be a linear orbit in the meridional plane , etc .",
    "in this section , we will integrate numerically several sets of orbits in an attempt to distinguish the regular or chaotic nature of motion .",
    "we use the initial conditions mentioned in section [ compmeth ] in order to construct the respective grids of initial conditions , taking always values inside the zero velocity curve ( zvc ) defined by @xmath90 in all cases , the value of the angular momentum of the orbits is @xmath91 .",
    "we chose the energy level @xmath92 which correspond to @xmath93 kpc , where @xmath94 is the maximum possible value of @xmath1 on the @xmath86 phase plane .",
    "once the values of the parameters were chosen , we computed a set of initial conditions as described in section [ compmeth ] and integrated the corresponding orbits calculating the values of fli and sali indicators and then classifying the regular orbits into different families .",
    ".type and initial conditions of the galaxy model orbits shown in figs .",
    "[ orbs](a - h ) . in all cases , @xmath95 and @xmath96 is found from the energy integral , eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , while @xmath97 is the period of the resonant parent periodic orbits . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we therefore used an integration time of @xmath98 time units throughout .",
    "we then established new thresholds by taking advantage of our computation of two chaos indicators , as follows .",
    "first , the set of orbits of a given grid was integrated , as we already said , for @xmath78 time units ( i.e. , about @xmath99 years , thus avoiding sticky orbits with a stickiness at least of the order of one hubble time ) .",
    "then , their fli and sali were computed , and we looked for those values of the thresholds that maximised the agreement in the classification of both methods .",
    "we found those values which leave less than 1% of orbits per grid differently classified by both methods .",
    "[ trs ] shows the resulting thresholds for both indicators when @xmath38 .",
    "the horizontal and vertical blue lines correspond to the new established threshold values for the fli and sali which are @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "green dots indicate regular orbits , while chaotic orbits are marked with red dots .",
    "however , we can observe eight orange dots , corresponding to orbits for which the classifications of both indicators did not coincide .",
    "similar results apply to all other grid models . as a reference ,",
    "table [ table2 ] shows the number of orbits which did nt get the same classification in every model using either @xmath102 or @xmath78 time units of numerical integration .",
    "here we must point out , that all grids contain the same number of initial conditions of orbits which is 7173 .",
    "it is evident from table [ table2 ] , that using larger integration time the number of misclassified orbits in every grid has been considerably reduced .",
    "nevertheless , this do nt solve completely the problem ; in fact , there will always be ( in a non integrable potential ) sticky orbits which behave as regular ones during arbitrarily large times , rendering any attempt to develop an algorithm which finds them all in a short time hopeless .",
    "thus , the moral of the story is that the adjective  fast \" which is attached to many chaos detection algorithms should not be interpreted as  which detects chaos at an earlier dynamical time than the mlcn \" , as sometimes is used , but as  computationally faster than the mlcn \" .",
    "in the present paper , we used an analytic , axially symmetric galactic gravitational model which embraces the general features of a disk galaxy with an additional central , non spherical and dense nucleus . in order to simplify our study",
    ", we chose to work in the meridional plane @xmath0 , thus reducing three - dimensional motion to two - dimensional .",
    "our aim was to investigate how influential is the flattening parameter @xmath20 which controls the shape of the central nucleus , on the level of chaos and also on the distribution of regular families in our disk galaxy model .",
    "our extensive numerical results suggest , that the level of chaos as well as the different families of regular orbits are indeed very dependent on the shape ( prolate , spherical or oblate ) of the central galactic nucleus .",
    "a disk galaxy with a non spherical nucleus is undoubtedly a very complex entity and , therefore , we need to assume some necessary simplifications and assumptions in order to be able to study mathematically the orbital behavior of such a complicated stellar system . for this purpose ,",
    "our model is intentionally simple and contrived , in order to give us the ability to study all the different aspects regarding the kinematics and dynamics of the model .",
    "nevertheless , contrived models can provide an insight into more realistic stellar systems , which unfortunately are very difficult to be studied , if we take into account all the astrophysical aspects .",
    "self - consistent models on the other hand , are mainly used when conducting @xmath4-body simulations . however , this application is entirely out of the scope of the present research .",
    "once again , we have to point out that the simplicity of our model is necessary ; otherwise it would be extremely difficult , or even impossible , to apply the extensive and detailed dynamical study presented in this study .",
    "similar gravitational models with the same limitations and assumptions were used successfully several times in the past in order to investigate the orbital structure in much more complicated galactic systems ( e.g. , [ @xcite,@xcite ] ) .    since a distribution function of the galaxy model was not available so as to use it for extracting the different samples of orbits , we had to follow an alternative path .",
    "so , for determining the regular or chaotic nature of motion in our models , we chose , for each set of values of the flattening parameter , a dense grid of initial conditions in the @xmath86 phase plane , regularly distributed in the area allowed by the value of the orbital energy @xmath70 .",
    "each orbit was integrated numerically for a time period of @xmath78 time units ( 10 billion yr ) , which corresponds to a time span of the order of hundreds of orbital periods but of the order of one hubble time .",
    "the particular choice of the total integration time was made in order to eliminate sticky orbits ( classifying them correctly as chaotic orbits ) with a stickiness at least of the order of one hubble time .",
    "then , we made a step further , in an attempt to distribute all regular orbits into different families .",
    "therefore , once an orbit has been characterized as regular , we then further classified it using a frequency analysis method .",
    "this method calculates the fourier transform of the coordinates and velocities of an orbit , identifies its peaks , extracts the corresponding frequencies and then searches for the fundamental frequencies and their possible resonances .    in this work",
    ", we revealed the influence of the flattening parameter @xmath20 of the central non spherical nucleus on the level of chaos and also on the distribution of the regular families among its orbits in disk galaxy models with non spherical nuclei .",
    "the main results of our research can be summarized as follows :    1 .   in our galaxy models",
    "several types of regular orbits exist , while there is also an extended chaotic domain separating the areas of regularity .",
    "in particular , most types of regular orbits , such as the box , 1:1 , 2:1 , 3:2 , 4:3 , 6:5 , higher resonant and chaotic orbits are always present when @xmath20 varies .",
    "the 2:3 resonant family , on the other hand , disappears when the flattening parameter obtains high values @xmath103 .",
    "here we must clarify , that by the term  higher resonant orbits \" we refer to resonant orbits with a rational quotient of frequencies made from integers @xmath104 , which of course do not belong to the main families .",
    "there is a strong correlation between the percentages of most types of orbits and the value of the flattening parameter .",
    "almost throughout the values of @xmath20 chaotic motion is the dominant type of motion ; only when @xmath105 regular motion prevails being the box orbits the most populated family . generally , the percentages of box and 2:1 resonant orbits decrease , while the rates of the 1:1 and 4:3 resonant orbits exhibit a constant growth with increasing @xmath20 .",
    "the portion of 3:2 resonant orbits decreases sharply for small values of @xmath20 @xmath106 , while this tendency is reversed at higher values of the flattening parameter @xmath107 .",
    "the 2:3 resonant family is stable only when @xmath108 , while for larger values of @xmath20 it becomes unstable and finally ceases to exist .",
    "the rates of the 6:5 and higher resonant orbits on the other hand , are almost unperturbed by the shifting of the value of @xmath20 .",
    "summarizing , our numerical calculations indicate that the flattening parameter of the central non spherical nucleus affects more or less almost all types of orbits in disk galaxy models .",
    "3 .   in disk galaxy models with non spherical nuclei",
    ", there are stable as well as unstable periodic orbits .",
    "we found , that the 2:1 , 1:1 , 3:2 and 4:3 periodic orbits remain stable throughout the entire range of the values of @xmath20 . on the contrary ,",
    "the 2:3 and 6:5 families of periodic orbits contain not only stable but also a considerable amount of unstable periodic orbits .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the flattening parameter @xmath20 affects substantially the stability of the regular families of orbits , hinting at a deep interplay between chaos and proportion of regular families .",
    "over the last years , several dynamical indicators for distinguishing between ordered and chaotic motion have been developed .",
    "the vast majority of these indicators is based on the evolution of sets of deviation vectors in order to characterize an orbit and most of them claim to be equally reliable and fast .",
    "therefore , based on this assumption we applied both the fli and sali indicators using a relatively short integration time of only @xmath102 time units , in order to save computation time .",
    "however , after performing a few longer integrations using a time interval of @xmath78 time units , we realized that a non - negligible number of orbits was in fact misclassified .",
    "what happened was that both chaos indicators failed to identify the true chaotic nature of sticky orbits due to the short available integration time .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the so called  fast \" indicators of chaos can not reliably identify chaos when the orbits are numerically integrated for short time intervals",
    ". they may be computationally faster than the traditional mlcn method , but they can not overcome the intrinsic difficulty of disentangle sticky orbits form regular ones .",
    "as an aside , we found that , by combining two chaos indicators ; the fli and the sali algorithms in our case , we can define for both methods reliable thresholds , thus separating more accurately chaotic from regular motion .",
    "however , the particular thresholds are valid only in our galaxy model .",
    "the bottom line of our research is that in every dynamical system one should initially perform thorough statistical tests in order to define the best thresholds of the chaotic indicators and also use sufficient time of numerical integration , thus minimizing as possible the amount of misclassified orbits .",
    "we consider the results of the present research as an initial effort and also a promising step in the task of exploring the orbital structure of disk galaxies with non spherical nuclei .",
    "taking into account that our outcomes are encouraging , it is in our future plans to modify properly our dynamical model in order to expand our investigation into three dimensions , thus unveiling how the flattening parameter influences the nature of the three - dimensional orbits .",
    "also , of particular interest would be to obtain the entire network of periodic orbits , revealing the evolution of the periodic points as well as their stability when varying all the available parameters of our model .",
    "the authors would like to express their warmest thanks to the two anonymous referees for the careful reading of the manuscript and for all the apt suggestions and comments which allowed us to improve both the quality and the clarity of our paper .",
