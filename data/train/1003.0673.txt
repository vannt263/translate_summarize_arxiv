    "statistical isotropy ( si ) is one of the most standard predictions of structure - formation and inflationary models . in this hypothesis ,",
    "the density fluctuations in the universe are a realization of a random field whose statistical properties ( e.g. power spectra ) are invariant under rotations . when probing density fluctuations using the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature , si is generally assumed in the analysis .",
    "however , searches for violations of si , or statistical anisotropy , are now being performed with increasing precision as the amount of cmb data has grown .",
    "these searches are revealing possible evidence for statistical anisotropy in the cmb @xcite , including a possible detection of quadrupolar anisotropy @xcite . in response , many have proposed inflationary and dark - energy theories with parameters that quantify departures from si @xcite . the detection of quadrupolar anisotropy in the cmb now appears to be contaminated by systematic effects ( possibly beam asymmetry @xcite , although this is debated @xcite ) ; as such it is desirable to constrain quadrupolar anisotropy by other techniques .",
    "one way to quantify statistical anisotropy is to allow the three - dimensional power spectrum of matter density fluctuations @xmath0 to depend on the direction of @xmath9 .",
    "this is a full description for gaussian but anisotropic initial perturbations .",
    "this approach was motivated by the inflationary model of ref .",
    "@xcite , a model for which pullen & kamionkowski @xcite constructed parameter estimators for cmb analysis . as usual ,",
    "if @xmath10 is the fourier amplitude of the fractional matter density perturbation , an anisotropic power spectrum is defined via @xmath11 where the angle brackets denote an average over all realizations of the random field , and @xmath12 is a dirac @xmath13-function ; note that we still preserve the assumption that different fourier modes are uncorrelated ( statistical _ homogeneity _ ) .",
    "a direction - dependent @xmath0 can be decomposed via @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the isotropically averaged matter power spectrum , and @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 ) are real spherical harmonics .",
    "physically , @xmath17 gives the magnitude of statistical anisotropy on order @xmath18 , with @xmath19 giving the direction of that anisotropy . also , @xmath20 for odd @xmath18 because a real scalar density field always has @xmath21 and hence @xmath22 .",
    "we define the real spherical harmonics @xmath23 in terms of the complex spherical harmonics @xmath24 by @xmath25 these are easily seen to obey the usual orthonormality rules , but have the advantage of making the @xmath17 coefficients real . the expressions for @xmath26",
    "are given in appendix [ a : realhar ] .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to measure or constrain the anisotropy using large scale structure data .",
    "given the recent debate over the detection of quadrupolar anomalies in wmap , and the evidence that the signal is contaminated by systematic effects @xcite , it is worth using other datasets as well to constrain models with anisotropic power . in this paper",
    "we will assume for simplicity that @xmath17 is scale - invariant .",
    "this is both a simplifying assumption , but is also a good first approximation in at least some classes of modified inflationary models @xcite .",
    "we will also focus only on the quadrupole anisotropy @xmath27 ; this is the phenomenologically simplest type of anisotropy allowed , and also emerges from anisotropic inflation models in the limit of very weak anisotropy @xcite .",
    "galaxy surveys probe matter fluctuations because on large scales , the galaxy density is related to the matter density in accordance with a linear bias model : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fourier amplitude of the fractional galaxy density perturbation , and @xmath30 is the linear galaxy bias .",
    "the galaxy survey probe has been used to estimate @xmath0 by stacking the measured angular matter power spectra @xmath31 in eight photometric redshift slices ranging from @xmath32 @xcite . by performing a similar analysis and including the anisotropy parameters @xmath27 in the power spectrum , we can use galaxy surveys to estimate quadrupole anisotropy while assuming fiducial values for the other cosmological parameters .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows : in section [ s : sample ] we describe the sdss data used and why we choose lrgs to trace the galaxy distribution .",
    "section [ s : form ] calculates the angular correlations statistical anisotropy produces in galaxy surveys and constructs estimators of the @xmath27s and other systematic power spectrum variations .",
    "we present estimates of these parameters in section [ s : result ] , and in section [ s : conclude ] we present our conclusions . wherever not explicitly mentioned , we assume a flat @xmath33cdm cosmology with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . since ours is a search for anisotropy , small changes in the cosmology will result only in changes in the calibration of the @xmath27 estimator ; they do not alter the null hypothesis .",
    "there are several ways to use galaxy survey data to search for statistical anisotropy . in principle , one could use a 3-dimensional redshift survey and search for anisotropy in the power spectrum .",
    "this would however be very technically involved : redshift - space distortions make the line of sight direction special . with sufficient sky coverage one could break the distinction between redshift - space distortions and true statistical anisotropy .",
    "however , in this paper we choose the technically simpler route of using photometric galaxy catalogues , which can be studied using estimators analogous to those for the cmb .",
    "the photometric data we use come from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "the sdss consists of a 2.5 m telescope @xcite with a 5-filter ( _ ugriz _ ) imaging camera @xcite and a spectrograph .",
    "automated pipelines are responsible for the astrometric solution @xcite and photometric calibration @xcite .",
    "bright galaxies , luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) , and quasars are selected for follow - up spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the data used here were acquired between august 1998 and october 2004 and are included in sdss data release 5 @xcite .",
    "we use a sample of photometrically classified luminous red galaxies .",
    "lrgs are the most luminous galaxies in the universe , making them appealing for probing maximal volume",
    ". they also tend to be old stellar systems with uniform spectral energy distributions and a strong discontinuity at 4000 @xmath39 , which enables precise photometric redshifts and hence measurements of @xmath40 in multiple redshift slices .",
    "this both reduces statistical error bars and allows tests for consistency .",
    "the cuts that define the photometric lrg sample are enumerated in ref .",
