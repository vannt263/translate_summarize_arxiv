    "<S> the cell is coated with teflon to avoid depolarization of atoms colliding with the wall . during data taking , </S>",
    "<S> the target polarization @xmath22 is changed every 2pointing in sequence , up , down ( @xmath23 y ) , left , right ( @xmath23 x ) , and along , opposite to the beam direction ( @xmath23 z ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the polarization is the same within @xmath23 0.005 for all orientations [ 3,4 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the detector arrangement consists of a stack of scintillators and wire chambers , covering a forward cone with a 30  opening angle . </S>",
    "<S> the scintillators are capable of stopping protons from @xmath0 , thus measuring their energy . from the time of flight and the relative energy deposited in the layers of the detector , </S>",

    "<S> a measurement with a nitrogen target matches the shape of the @xmath24 distribution seen with the h target , except for the @xmath25 peak , and is used to subtract background which remains under the @xmath25 mass peak ( between 5 and 10 ) . within statistics , </S>",

    "<S> the vertical and longitudinal components of the beam polarization @xmath27 at the target are about equal , with a small sideways component . </S>",
    "<S> since the solenoid fields are fixed in strength , the exact polarization direction depends on beam energy after acceleration . only either the vertical or the longitudinal component contributes to the total cross section , depending on the orientation of the target polarization . in alternating measurement cycles , the sign of the beam polarization is reversed . </S>",

    "<S> , two data runs , separated by five months , were combined . </S>",
    "<S> the detector acceptance is less than 100because of a hole in the center of the detector stack which accommodates the circulating beam , and excludes particles with @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting loss of events ( about 30 at the lowest energy ) is taken into account by applying a correction which arises from a difference in detector acceptance for ss , ps and pp final states [ 1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this correction turns out to be small ( between 0.009 and 0.058 for / , and between 0.007 and 0.030 for / ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the final results are listed in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the errors include counting statistics , and an uncertainty for background subtraction and hole correction . </S>",

    "<S> most of the theoretical work on @xmath0 so far deals with the lowest partial wave ( ss ) . </S>",
    "<S> an exception is the meson - exchange model of the jlich group [ 6 ] which contains the higher partial waves needed to address polarization observables . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation includes off - shell pion rescattering and the exchange of heavy mesons , and provides a good fit to the ss part of the total cross section close to threshold , or for @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the maximum center - of - mass pion momentum divided by the @xmath25 mass . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is not as good for the polarization observables measured here ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) which are sensitive to contributions from ps and pp partial waves .    as pointed out in the first part of this paper , the present measurement allows a model - free statement about the ps and pp contributions to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 directly yields the relative ps strength , @xmath41 the result is shown in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the ps strength is larger than previously thought [ 8 ] ( see below ) .    </S>",
    "<S> phase space arguments together with the properties of spherical bessel functions for small arguments lead to the expectation that @xmath42 is proportional to @xmath43 . in order to test this prediction </S>",
    "<S> , we have to multiply our experimental @xmath44by the total cross section . at t = 325an accurate value for the total cross section exists (= 7.70 @xmath23 0.26 , [ 7 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , </S>",
    "<S> at higher energies data are few and of poor quality , and a good measurement of between 0.3 and 1would certainly be a much  needed addition to the @xmath0 data base . for the present purpose we use a smooth approximation to the world s data , obtaining = 17 , 40 , and 86 , for t = 350 , 375 , and 400 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 represents the fit with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the error of the scaling factor takes into account the errors of the data , and the uncertainty of at 325 . </S>",

    "<S> the dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 represents a fit with the expected energy dependence for pp waves , @xmath47 . the solid lines in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3,4 are obtained with the jlich meson  exchange model [ 6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that the ps strength which , in this model , is dominated by the role of the @xmath48 ( a nucleon excited state ) is underestimated by about a factor of 3 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) , while for ( @xmath46 ) the discrepancy is less but the energy dependence is not correctly reproduced by the model ( fig .  4 ) .    in the absence of polarization observables , </S>",
    "<S> some information on individual partial  wave contributions can be extracted from a measurement of the ( unpolarized ) cross section as a function of the relative energy of the two nucleons in the final  state , assuming that the corresponding energy distributions of single partial waves are known . </S>",
    "<S> as our data indicate , power laws in @xmath40 seem adequate for the ps and pp partial waves , but the energy dependence of the ss partial wave is dominated by the final  state interaction , and thus requires model  dependent input . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis has been carried out for @xmath0 at 310 ( @xmath49 ) [ 8 ] . in that work </S>",
    "<S> a significant contribution was found from an sd - ss interference term . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion was reached , however , setting @xmath50 , while from the present data , using an @xmath43 energy dependence , we estimate that , at 310 , @xmath42 contributes about 6to .    in summary , we have measured both spin  dependent total cross sections in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these polarization observables allow a model - free determination of individual partial wave contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we show in an example that this can provide a test of individual components of a model ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3,4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of polarization observables is crucial when carrying out a partial wave study , since an analysis based only on the unpolarized differential cross section is subject to model dependence .    </S>",
