    "the two 0.1200gev flares in allow us to assess the correspondence between @xmath1-ray and lower - frequency variations .",
    "we find that two kinds of events at millimeter wavelengths are related to these @xmath1-ray outbursts at high significance : ( 1 ) the early , rising phases of the two most luminous 1 mm flares ever detected in this blazar , ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) ; and ( 2 ) two sharp increases to unprecedented levels of linear polarization ( @xmath74% and @xmath75% ) in bright jet feature c1 @xmath2pc from the central engine .",
    "these events also coincide with : ( 3 ) two sharp optical flares ; ( 4 ) two peaks in optical polarization of @xmath76% ; and ( 5 ) the similarity of optical and mm - wave polarization position angle both during and between the flares at @xmath66-@xmath67 .",
    "the exceptionally high polarization of c1 during @xmath1-ray flare @xmath37 provides extremely strong evidence that the event occurred in c1 .",
    "this has two important implications .",
    "first , given the distance of c1 from the central engine , the @xmath39@xmath40gev flares must be produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering rather than nuclear collisions .",
    "second , the @xmath1-ray ic emission arises from either the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process or ic scattering of infrared radiation from a hot , dusty torus of size @xmath77  pc ( ic / dust ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an ssc model is possible given the low ratio of @xmath1-ray to synchrotron luminosity between @xmath78 and @xmath79hz ( @xmath80 ) in , based on the fluxes we measure and a spectral index of @xmath81 between @xmath78 and @xmath79hz @xcite .",
    "inverse - compton scattering of dust emission predicts that the optical and @xmath1-ray emission should vary together , since the electron energies involved are similar ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is the case during the @xmath1-ray flares .",
    "the general data are therefore consistent with both the ssc and the ic / dust models .",
    "the observed behavior agrees with a scenario in which the optical and @xmath1-ray flares are produced in c1 by particle acceleration in a moving blob when it crosses a standing shock ( fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) well beyond the acz . @xcite have associated the innermost mm - wave jet emission feature with a recollimation shock at the end of the acz .",
    "we identify c0 as such a feature , and c1 as a second re - collimation shock , as seen in hydrodynamical simulations @xcite and often in vlba images @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a similar system of three conical shocks to explain the fine structure in the innermost 7 mm jet of in a feature that would be identified as the `` core '' at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "in , the higher flux of c1 relative to c0 could be caused by curvature in the jet increasing the doppler beaming with distance from c0 so that it is maximized at c1 .",
    "a blob is either a shock or another disturbance that propagates down the jet with significantly higher relativistic electron density and magnetic field than in the ambient flow .",
    "the typical weakness of the observed polarization outside the high polarization peaks favors a turbulent plasma over a shock .",
    "@xcite shows that , in this case , the side of the conical shock nearest to the line of sight can be highly polarized with @xmath58 parallel to the jet axis .",
    "the remainder of the conical shock , farther from the line of sight , has much lower polarization .",
    "because of light - travel delays , we first see the blob penetrate the near side , and therefore observe a major increase in polarization .",
    "as the outburst develops , more of the emission comes from the low - polarization far side , which decreases @xmath57 while the mm - wave flux density continues to increase .",
    "this is the pattern observed during both flares .",
    "the mm - wave and optical flares start at essentially the same time as the magnetic field and electron energies near the leading edge of the blob become amplified as they pass the standing shock front .",
    "the mm - wave flux outburst continues as the relatively low - energy electrons fill the shocked region .",
    "the optical and @xmath1-ray emission , produced by higher - energy electrons that can not travel far before suffering radiative energy losses , is confined closer to the shock front where particles are accelerated @xcite .",
    "if synchrotron losses were the sole factor , the optical and @xmath1-ray flux would reach a plateau once the shocked blob plasma fills the entire layer behind the shock , declining only when the upstream side of the blob passes the shock front .",
    "however , if ssc emission dominates , the radiative losses will increase as synchrotron photons from the flare reach electrons that scatter them to high energies .",
    "the radiative energy losses then increase until the loss rate reaches a factor of @xmath82 $ ] ( @xmath83 in the case of ) higher than the initial case of only synchrotron losses .",
    "this decreases the volume of emission as a function of time in the optical and @xmath1-ray ranges .",
    "the time - scale for this decrease is the light - travel time across the shock times @xmath84 days , where @xmath85 is the cross - sectional angular size of the jet and the doppler factor ( @xmath86 ) is that derived by @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the time - scale of the @xmath1-ray flux decline of flare @xmath37 ( @xmath87 - 4 weeks , see fig .",
    "[ tflux ] ) .",
    "quenching of the flares by increasing ssc energy losses operates only if the @xmath1-rays are produced by the ssc process .",
    "hence , the multi - frequency behavior of the flares is difficult to reproduce in the ic / dust model .",
    "also , infrared emission from the dusty torus has not been detected thus far in bl  lacs such as , as far as the authors know .",
