    "excess kurtosis appears below @xmath142 , indicating a more peaked  distribution with a fatter tail .",
    "when no interactions are present , this excess kurtosis remains present as the temperature is lowered to zero .",
    "including interactions ( @xmath106 as before ) is seen to reduce the kurtosis back down to 3 as the temperature goes to zero .",
    "so , interactions not only suppress the size of the fluctuations , they also tend to keep the fluctuations gaussian .",
    "this effect is more pronounced at temperatures well below @xmath141 .",
    "when the temperature is near to @xmath141 the effect of the interactions is less .",
    "note that there is a small leptokurtic region at temperatures just above zero  it is not clear whether this is an artifact of the calculations ( we take @xmath14 up to 2000 for the sum in the grand - canonical ensemble ) or whether this is real .",
    "the lti model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lti3 ] ) again predicts a qualitatively very similar behavior to the bdl model ( fig .",
    "[ figkurt ] ) .",
    "motivated by the landmark experiment observing grand - canonical statistics in photon condensates  @xcite , we revisit differences between statistical ensembles when describing bose - einstein condensates .",
    "the focus if the current paper lies on microscopic modelling of thermodynamic properties for small but experimentally accessible particle numbers . for an ideal bose gas the grand - canonical ensemble predicts rms fluctuations for both the total number of particles and for the number of particles in the condensate that are larger than the average number of particles ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : lti1 ] , [ figgctotal ] and [ fig : lti2 ] ) . while this clearly is unphysical for an atomic bose - einstein condensate with constant atom numbers , photon condensates open an entirely new world by making highly fluctuating total photon numbers possible .",
    "however , the realization of a grand - canonical photon condensate does not automatically imply that the textbook treatment of an ideal gas is valid .",
    "thus , we model _ weakly interacting _ photon condensates in order to investigate both condensate fluctuations and fluctuations of the total number of particles .",
    "the exactly solvable model systems of brosens , devreese and lemmens ( bdl model )  @xcite and a low temperature interaction model ( lti model ) based on  @xcite .",
    "the latter model becomes exact in the limit of low temperatures for pairwise interactions .",
    "as our two models are fundamentally differerent from each other , this helps to identify model - independent properties of , for example , fluctuations of the total number of particles .",
    "our paper focuses on a grand - canonical bose gas interactions that are so weak that the canonical fluctuations ( for fixed total particle numbers ) match well the results for a non - interacting system of bosons .",
    "the main results are listed below :    1 .   in the recent experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite it is mentioned that the statistics can be influenced by changing the effective size of the reservoir , by changing the number of dye molecules . however , as in the variational treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite , our microscopic treatment finds that already _ * weak interaction changes the fluctuations dramatically for low temperatures : * _ rather than @xmath143 as predicted for the ideal gas , the grand - canonical fluctuations vanish at low temperatures .",
    "the _ * interactions come into play essentially when we move to the grand - canonical ensemble*_. thus , the textbook example for treating bose - einstein condensation , the ideal bose gas , is a too idealized example to correctly describe the grand - canonical fluctuations investigated experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite . slightly below the condensation temperature",
    "we still find very large rms fluctuations @xmath144 .",
    "as our paper focuses on experimentally realistic small particle numbers , this is very distinct from considerations arguing against the existence of anomalous fluctuations based on stability arguments in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "however , in agreement with  @xcite , even very weak interactions considerably suppress fluctuations .",
    "we find that the _ * fluctuations are strongly non - gaussian , showing substantial excess kurtosis*_. for low temperatures , even very weak interactions suppress both fluctuations and the non - gaussian character of the fluctuations .    for the bdl model",
    ", the fact that the center of mass degree of freedom may have a different frequency from all the other degrees of freedom does not alter the number of condensate particles , nor the condensate fluctuation .",
    "when no interactions are present , it is known that the condensate fluctuations in the grand - canonical ensemble become as large as the total number of particles .    in the bdl model considered here ,",
    "the role of interactions is to change the spectrum of possible energy states of the subsystem as a function of the number of particles in the subsystem .",
    "there is a secondary effect of interactions , clear in the transition from @xmath58 to @xmath145 , and which consists in endowing one degree of freedom with frequency @xmath41 rather than @xmath146 .",
    "however , this single degree of freedom has only a negligible effect on the results , even for @xmath147 as low as @xmath128  whether we work with @xmath58 or @xmath145 , we find qualitatively the same results .",
    "these results for the harmonically interacting model system show that interactions reduce the number fluctuations in the grand - canonical ensemble , and make the fluctuations more gaussian",
