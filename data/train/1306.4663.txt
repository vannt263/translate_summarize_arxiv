    "all stable elements heavier than lithium were forged in stars .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis produced helium efficiently , but it was halted by the expansion of the universe before it could go much further ( walker et al .",
    "on the other hand , all stars observed to date have substantial mass fractions of carbon , silicon , iron and other elements that are the products of the final stages of stellar evolution .",
    "in fact , even the most pristine stars observed ( cayrel et al .  2004 ; frebel et al .  2008 ; caffau et al .",
    "2011 ) have been polluted by this material .",
    "the earliest stellar generation , referred to as population iii ( pop iii ) , is missing .    while this absence could be due to the formation of an extremely small number of metal - free stars , detailed theoretical studies suggest that it is more likely that these stars were too massive to survive to the present day ( scannapieco 2006 ; brook 2007 ) .",
    "in fact , the absence of heavy elements drastically decreases the cooling rates in collapsing star - forming gas , such that that primordial gas clouds would have been much less susceptible to fragmentation , perhaps forming @xmath17 - 10@xmath18 solar mass star forming clumps ( hutchins 1976 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2000 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , the strong accretion rates onto the central protostellar cores in such pristine clumps can not be arrested by radiation pressure , bipolar outflows , or rotation ( ferrara 2001 ) , meaning that these regions may have formed stars with masses hundreds of times greater than the sun . on the other hand ,",
    "recent work suggests that physical processes such as enhanced hd cooling in shock - compressed primordial gas ( johnson & bromm 2006 ) , a lack of magnetic fields in primordial turbulent clouds ( padoan 2007 ) , photoionization of turbulent primordial clouds ( clark 2011a ) , fragmentation of the protostellar accretion disks ( stacy 2010 , clark et al .",
    "2011b ) , early termination of accretion ( mckee & tan 2008 , hosokawa 2011 ) , and gravitational torques ( greif 2012 ) , may have led to primordial stars with masses @xmath19 in single or perhaps binary systems ( turk , abel , & oshea 2009 ) .    even at these comparatively low masses , direct detections of primordial stars",
    "would be possible only through observations of the high - redshift universe , relying on what is likely to have been an extended transition between metal free and pre - enriched ( population ii / i ) star formation ( scannapieco 2003 ; jimenez & haiman 2006 ; trenti & stiavelli 2007 ; 2009 ; maio 2010 ) , as well as the unusual observable signatures of metal free stars . during their lifetimes",
    ", for example , the lack of heavy elements in pop iii stars drastically reduces their opacities , resulting in much higher surface temperatures and strong ultraviolet spectroscopic features that would distinguish them from current stellar populations ( schaerer 2002 ; nagao 2008 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if they were extremely massive , pop iii stars could be detectable as they ended their lives as tremendously powerful pair - production supernovae ( bond 1984 ; heger & woosley 2002 ; scannapieco 2005 ; whalen 2012 ) .",
    "furthermore , the reliance on h@xmath20 + hd cooling in primordial gas may have effects beyond masses of stars , such as affecting the phase nature of the interstellar medium and the star formation rate ( norman & spaans 1997 ) .",
    "whatever the detection method , when and where metal free gas condensed into stars is a question of fundamental importance in planning searches for this remarkable early generation of stars . on cosmological scales ,",
    "the key issue is the time it takes for heavy elements to propagate from one galaxy to another .",
    "as shown in scannapieco et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the distances between these oases of early star - formation are so vast that for several 100 million years , the universe was divided into two regions : one in which galaxies formed out of material that was already polluted with heavy elements well above the minimum ",
    "critical mass fraction , \" @xmath0 at which normal stellar evolution occurs ( schneider et al .",
    "2003 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ; omukai et al .",
    "2005 ) , and one in which galaxies were formed from initially pristine material .",
    "the evolution of initially - pristine galaxies is especially interesting , as it depends on two important theoretical issues .",
    "the first of these is the uncertain value of @xmath0 which is expected to lie in the range from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , ( or from @xmath23 to @xmath24 times solar metallicity ) , depending on whether the cooling is dominated by dust grains ( omukai et al .",
    "2005 ) or by the fine structure lines of carbon and oxygen ( bromm and loeb 2003 ) .",
    "the second important issue is the rate at which the gas within the galaxy can be polluted above this critical value by the turbulent mixing of heavy elements ( pan & scalo 2007 ) . within a given galaxy , the key quantity to characterize",
    "the transition is the fraction , @xmath25 , of the interstellar gas with metal concentration @xmath26 below @xmath4 as a function of time .",
    "the temporal behavior of this fraction depends not only on the rate at which new sources of metals are released to the interstellar gas , but , more importantly , on the transport and mixing of the metals in the interstellar gas .",
    "for example , a high mixing efficiency would result in a rapid decrease in @xmath25 , and hence a sharp transition as the average concentration exceeds the threshold @xmath4 . on the other hand",
    ", a low mixing efficiency would lead to a gradual transition .",
    "the interstellar medium is known to be turbulent and highly compressible , and the turbulent motions are likely to be supersonic .",
    "therefore , understanding mixing in supersonic turbulence is crucial to understanding the evolution of primordial gas in early galaxies .",
    "the evolution of the pristine fraction was considered by oey ( 2000 , 2003 ) in the context of the sequential enrichment model , which , however , does not reflect or correctly capture the physics of mixing in interstellar turbulence .    in pan ,",
    "scannapieco , & scalo ( 2012 ; hereafter pss ) , we developed a theoretical approach to model the evolution of the pristine fraction in statistically homogeneous turbulence .",
    "the starting point of our theoretical model was the pdf method for turbulent mixing , since the pristine fraction @xmath25 corresponds to the far left tail of the metallicity pdf .",
    "the pdf equation for passive scalars can not be solved exactly , and we adopted several closure models from the literature and derived predictions for the evolution of the pristine fraction . using numerical simulations , we showed that a class of pdf closure models , called self - convolution models , provided successful fitting functions to the evolution of @xmath25 for a limited range of flow mach number and pollution properties .",
    "these models are based on the physical picture of turbulence stretching pollutants and causing a cascade of concentration structures toward small scales ( pan & scalo 2007 ) , a picture that is generally valid in turbulent flows at all mach numbers ( pan & scannapieco 2010 ; hereafter ps10 ) .",
    "mixing occurs as the scale of the structures becomes sufficiently small for molecular diffusivity to efficiently operate , and the homogenization between neighboring structures can be described as a convolution of the concentration pdf .",
    "as discussed in more detail below , the models are dependent on two major parameters : @xmath27 which sets the characteristic timescale for convolution of the metal abundance pdf through turbulent stretching of concentration structures , and @xmath7 , which quantifies the degree of spatial locality of the pdf convolution process .",
    "here we use a suite of numerical simulations to expand these results and show that the generalized self - convolution model provides good fits for all the turbulence and pollutant conditions relevant for primordial star formation . note that , besides affecting the temperature directly , h@xmath20 + hd cooling without heavy elements makes neutral primordial gas less compressible ( scalo & biswas 2002 ; spaans & silk 2005 ) , emphasizing the importance of studying the mach number dependence of the pollution processes . by comparing this model to simulations with mach numbers",
    "@xmath28 2.1 , 3.5 , & 6.2 , in which pollutants are added at different length scales , and 4 different initial values of @xmath16 we are able to obtain detailed fits of @xmath27 and @xmath7 over all mach numbers , initial pollution fraction , and pollution scales of interest .",
    "we tabulate and obtain empirical fits to our results , and show how they can be used both to make simple one - zone estimates of the evolution of @xmath5 within a single high - redhshift galaxy , as well as to construct a subgrid model for numerical simulations , which tracks the evolution of the primordial fraction below the resolution scale .",
    "the model is expected to improve the prediction for the evolution of the primordial gas fraction in early galaxies , and should also be applicable to any physical problem in which the unresolved , unmixed fraction needs to be tracked throughout a simulation .",
    "a realistic simulation for the pollution of the pristine gas in early galaxies needs to properly specify the driving mechanism of the interstellar turbulence .",
    "a variety of physical processes may contribute to turbulent motions in the interstellar medium .",
    "turbulence can be produced at galactic scales , e.g , by the gas infall from the halo or by merger events during the assembly of the galaxy .",
    "supernova explosions by the first stars also contribute to the turbulent energy . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt a solenoidal driving force in the simulations , which may be a good approximation if the interstellar turbulence is mainly driven by large - scale motions or instabilities , associated with galaxy formation , mergers or interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "if the primary source for turbulent energy is stellar winds and supernova explosions , the driving force may be compressive rather than solenoidal .",
    "in that case , several questions need to be addressed by future studies .",
    "first , as shown by federrath et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , a compressively driven supersonic turbulent flow shows significantly different statistics than the solenoidal case .",
    "the amplitude of the density fluctuations is much larger due to stronger compressions , and the intermittency of the velocity field is significantly higher .",
    "we will speculate how these features may qualitatively affect the parameters in our convolution models .",
    "a quantitative understanding may be obtained by a suite of simulations using driving forces at different degrees of compressibility .",
    "second , if supernovae are the primary energy source of turbulence , the injection of heavy elements is highly correlated with the turbulent driving force .",
    "this is not accounted for in our simulations either .",
    "these issues are complicated and require a systematic investigation .",
    "this is , however , beyond of the scope of the current paper , which is essentially an initial step that provides the theoretical framework and useful subgrid methodology for the modeling of the pristine gas pollution in early galaxies .",
    "the structure of this work is as follows . in ",
    "2 we introduce the pdf formulation for turbulent mixing , and discuss the fundamental mixing physics . in  3 , we describe the self- convolution closure models , and show how they can be used to predict the evolution of the pristine fraction in statistically homogeneous turbulence . in  4 we describe our suite of numerical simulations , and in  5 we use them to test and constrain the self - convolution models over the full range of turbulence and pollution conditions necessary to model primordial star formation .",
    "having fixed the parameters in the theoretical models with our simulation results we show how they can then be applied to one zone models of high - redshift galaxies in  6 , and in  7 we show how they can be used to construct subgrid models for the unresolved primordial fraction in large , numerical simulations .",
    "a summary of our conclusions is given in  8 .",
    "the mixing of heavy elements in the interstellar medium can be studied by tracking the evolution of the concentration field , @xmath29 , defined as the ratio of the local density of these elements to the total gas density .",
    "the concentration field obeys the advection - diffusion equation , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the density and velocity fields in interstellar turbulence , @xmath33 is the molecular diffusivity , and the term @xmath34 represents continuing sources of heavy elements or pollutants .",
    "the concentration field , @xmath29 , could also represent the local abundance of a specific element , but here we are interested in the mass fraction of all metals at a given location .",
    "the pristine mass fraction in a flow corresponds to the low tail of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the pollutant concentration , so we adopt a pdf approach for turbulent mixing .",
    "this approach was first established for the turbulent velocity field ( monin 1967 and lundgren1967 ) and was later extended to mixing of passive or reactive species in turbulent flows ( ievlev 1973 ; dopazo and obrien 1974 ; pope 1976 ; obrien 1980 ; pope 1985 ; kollemann 1990 ; dopazo et al .",
    "it has been particularly successful in the field of reacting turbulent flows ( e.g. , haworth 2010 ) .",
    "however , most of the work on the pdf modeling of turbulent mixing has been dedicated to incompressible or weakly compressible turbulence . in order to apply the method to the interstellar media of galaxies , where strong density fluctuations exist ,",
    "pss generalized the pdf formulation to mixing in highly compressible turbulent flows at large mach numbers , emphasizing the importance of using a density weighting scheme .    as in pss , herewe",
    "use a statistical ensemble to define a density - weighted concentration pdf , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the fine - grained pdf in a single realization , @xmath37 denotes the ensemble average , and @xmath26 is the sampling variable .",
    "the probability distribution defined here at a given position and time is an average over many independent realizations in the statistical ensemble .",
    "the ensemble average density , @xmath38 , is in general a function of @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in pss",
    ", @xmath38 was implicitly assumed to be constant .",
    "below we consider the more general case that accounts for the spatial and temporal variations of @xmath38 .",
    "an important motivation for using a density - weighting factor is that , when studying mixing of primordial gas in early galaxies , it is appropriate to consider the mass fraction , rather than the volume fraction , of the interstellar gas with @xmath41 .",
    "an equation for @xmath42 can be derived using the advection - diffusion equation ( [ advection ] ) , for @xmath43 and the continuity equation , for @xmath31 . applying the same method as in appendix a of pss and accounting for the spatial and temporal dependence of @xmath44 , we find , @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the conditional ensemble average with density weighting .",
    "for any physical quantity , @xmath47 , this ensemble average is defined as , @xmath48 where the conditional average @xmath49 without density - weighting is evaluated by selecting and counting only those realizations satisfying the constraint that the concentration @xmath29 at @xmath39 and @xmath40 is equal to @xmath26 .",
    "setting @xmath38 to be constant reduces eq .",
    "( [ pdfeq ] ) to eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) in pss .",
    "derivations of analogous pdf equations for passive and reacting scalar turbulence in the incompressible case can be found in e.g. , pope ( 2000 ) and fox ( 2003 ) .",
    "the pdf equation is essentially a liouville equation for the conservation of the concentration probability in phase space . in analogy to the liouville equation in kinetic theory , the concentration field corresponds to the particle momentum and the advection - diffusion equation corresponds to the particle equation of motion ( pss ) .",
    "although the pdf equation is derived in the context of a statistical ensemble , it is also useful for the study of scalar statistics in a single realization , i.e. , the real flow",
    ". if the flow and the scalar statistics are spatially homogeneous , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are independent of @xmath39 , and the ergodic theorem indicates that the statistics over an ensemble is equivalent to that over the spatial domain of a single realization .",
    "this means that @xmath51 is equal to the pdf , @xmath52 , computed from the density and concentration fluctuations over the entire volume , @xmath53 , of the real flow domain . at galactic length scales ,",
    "the assumption of statistical homogeneity is likely invalid .",
    "for example , coherent mean flows , such as galactic rotation , infall or outflow , may exist at large scales in the interstellar medium .",
    "also a large - scale metallicity gradient may develop if the star formation rate has a radial dependence , and the metallicity statistics can vary substantially from region to region .    however , the ensemble - defined pdf @xmath54 may still be used to study this spatial dependence if it is understood as corresponding to the concentration pdf for local fluctuations in a region of considerable size in the real flow .",
    "if the size is selected to be large enough to allow sufficient statistics , but small enough for local statistical homogeneity to be restored ( i.e. , considerably smaller than the characteristic scale for the mean flow or mean concentration gradient ) , then the ergodic theorem will apply locally , and @xmath51 will represent the pdf in the region around @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , in an attempt to build a subgrid model for the pollution of pristine interstellar gas , a concentrationpdf characterizing the fluctuations in local regions is defined by applying a spatial filter to the real flow ( see  7 and appendix a ) , and the equation derived for the filtered pdf is identical to eq .",
    "( [ pdfeq ] ) for @xmath54 over an ensemble .",
    "this confirms the equivalence of @xmath54 to the local concentration pdf in the real flow and the applicability of eq .",
    "( [ pdfeq ] ) to the study of mixing in a statistically inhomogeneous setting .",
    "the last three terms in eq .",
    "( [ pdfeq ] ) correspond to turbulent advection , molecular diffusivity and source terms in the advection - diffusion equation .",
    "we give a brief general discussion for each term below , and refer the interested reader to pss for more details .      the second term in eq .",
    "( [ pdfeq ] ) is the advection term .",
    "as it takes a divergence form , it conserves the global pdf with density - weighting , i.e. , the integral of @xmath55 over the entire flow domain .",
    "this corresponds to a fundamental issue in mixing physics : the turbulent velocity field does not homogenize at all by itself .",
    "intuitively , a velocity field moves , stretches and redistributes the concentration field , but it does not change the _ mass _ fraction of the fluid elements at a given concentration level , and thus does not truly mix . on the other hand , without density - weighting ,",
    "the advection term in the pdf equation would not be a divergence term if the flow is compressible , but instead be a term representing the effect of expansions and compressions on the volume fraction of fluid elements at a given concentration .",
    "this effect is different from mixing , and makes the pdf modeling more complicated .",
    "therefore , in addition to the practical reasons mentioned above , adopting a density - weighting scheme is also strongly motivated on a theoretical basis .",
    "the advection term vanishes and need not be considered in a flow that is statistically homogeneous . in case of statistical inhomogeneity",
    ", the term corresponds to the transport of the concentration pdf by the velocity field : turbulent advection causes changes in the local pdf as it moves the fluid elements around .",
    "if one is interested in the concentration fluctuations in a local region , this transport effect must be accounted for carefully .",
    "a similar advection term exists in the equation for the filtered pdf of the local concentration fluctuations , which is used to build a subgrid model for the pollution of pristine gas in early galaxies in  7 . in that case , a proper treatment of the advection term is essential , as it is responsible for the flux of pristine mass fraction into or out of a computation cell due to the velocity field ( see  7 ) .",
    "however , an exact treatment of the advection term is impossible due the usual difficulty in turbulence theory known as the closure problem ( see , e.g. , pope 2000 ) . a similar problem exists for the diffusivity term , which is discussed in more details in  2.2 .",
    "we will adopt the commonly - used eddy - diffusivity approximation to model the advection term in  7 .      as shown in pan & scalo ( 2007 ) and pss , the molecular diffusivity term in eq .",
    "( [ pdfeq ] ) ,",
    "i.e. , the first term on the right hand side , is the only term responsible for the homogenization of the concentration fluctuations .",
    "the term can be rewritten as ( see appendix a ) , @xmath56 where the first term on the right hand side is a spatial diffusion of the fine - grained concentration pdf ( defined in  2 ) by the molecular diffusivity . as a divergence term , it conserves the global pdf and does not contribute to true homogenization .",
    "the last term can be thought of as an anti - diffusion process in concentration space , as the coefficient is negative definite .",
    "it continuously narrows the pdf toward the mean value .",
    "unfortunately , this diffusivity term does not have an exact or closed form . as it involves concentration gradients , it is nonlocal and dependent on the two - point concentration pdf .",
    "deriving an equation for the two - point pdf gives rise to terms that require knowledge of three - point statistics , and so on , leading to a chain of multipoint pdf equations similar to the bbgky hierarchy in kinetic theory ( lundgren 1967 ; dopazo and obrein 1974 ) .",
    "assumptions must be made to truncate the hierarchy to obtain a closed set of equations .",
    "this is the so - called closure problem . in pss , we considered a number of closure models and showed that a class of models based on the convolution of the concentration pdf are particularly successful in fitting the simulation results for the pollution of pristine material in turbulent flows .",
    "one of these convolution models for closure of the diffusivity term was used in our earlier modeling of the primordial fraction ( pan & scalo 2007 ) .",
    "we will summarize these models in  3 .",
    "although the diffusivity term lacks an apparent dependence on the velocity field , an efficient homogenization of the concentration field does rely on the existence of turbulent motions .",
    "the action of the diffusivity term is very slow at large length scales where the pollutants are injected , because the molecular diffusivity @xmath33 is usually tiny in most natural environments including the interstellar medium .",
    "for example , pan & scalo ( 2007 ) estimated @xmath33 for the galaxy s ism , weighted by residence time in different phases of the neutral gas , of about @xmath57 @xmath58 s@xmath59 , with a corresponding diffusivity scale of @xmath60 pc , where @xmath61 is the galactic turbulence integral scale in units of 100 pc , and @xmath62 is the turbulent rms velocity in units of 10 km s@xmath59 .",
    "this is the scale to which turbulence must stretch the pollutants in order for mixing to occur .",
    "therefore , mixing by molecular diffusivity is negligible in the absence of a velocity field .",
    "a turbulent velocity can act as a catalyst and significantly accelerate the mixing process .",
    "this implicit role of turbulence on scalar homogenization is through the dependence of the diffusivity term on the concentration gradients ( see eq .",
    "( [ pdfeq ] ) ) . by continuously stretching the pollutants , turbulence produces structures at smaller and smaller scales , resulting in an enormous increase in the concentration gradients .",
    "once the structures reach a small scale called the diffusion scale , where molecular diffusivity operates faster than turbulent stretching , they are homogenized efficiently by the diffusivity term .",
    "this suggests that the mixing timescale is essentially determined by turbulent stretching , even though the velocity itself does not truly mix .",
    "it is the cooperation of molecular diffusivity and turbulent motions that gives a significant mixing efficiency .      the last term in eq .",
    "( [ pdfeq ] ) is the source term , corresponding to the injection of new pollutants into the turbulent flow . in general , pollutants are any source materials with a composition pattern different from that in the existing flow .",
    "thus for mixing of heavy elements in the interstellar media of galaxies , the source term would include both ejecta from supernova and stellar winds and , if it exists , infall of low - metallicity or primordial gas .",
    "to evaluate the source term , it is actually not necessary to compute its conditional average form in eq .",
    "( [ pdfeq ] ) . instead",
    ", it can be estimated by directly considering the rate at which the pollutants are injected and how they affect the concentration pdf in the flow .",
    "for example , assuming that the supernova ejecta are nearly pure metals , the source term for the supernova contribution would take a delta function form at @xmath63 with a coefficient depending on the supernova rate , ejecta mass etc ( see  6 and pan and scalo 2007 ) .",
    "on the other hand , a primordial infall would give a delta function at @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the effect of continuous sources of primordial gas and new metals is to force spikes in the concentration pdf at small and large concentration values , respectively .",
    "the primary goal of this study is to investigate how the diffusivity term in the pdf equation , representing the homogenization by molecular diffusivity catalyzed by turbulent motions , reduces the fraction of pristine material in a turbulent flow . to understand the fundamental physics",
    ", we consider an idealized problem : mixing of decaying scalars ( i.e. , @xmath65 = 0 ) in statistically stationary and homogeneous turbulence .",
    "the initial scalar field is also assumed to be statistically homogeneous .",
    "clearly , this idealized problem is much simpler than in a realistic galactic environment .",
    "however , the simplified setting is extremely useful for understanding the underlying physics .",
    "as discussed in  2 , under the assumption of statistical homogeneity , the advection term vanishes and the pdf , @xmath42 , is independent of @xmath39 and is equivalent to that computed from the spatial fluctuations in a single realization . with these simplifications ,",
    "the pdf equation becomes , @xmath66 where we used eq .",
    "( [ ensemblediffusivityterm ] ) .",
    "the diffusivity term is the only term in the simplified pdf equation .    in analogy with the mixing of primordial gas in early galaxies , we set the initial condition of the decaying scalar to be bimodal , consisting of pure pollutants ( @xmath63 ) and completely unpolluted flow ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a double - delta function form for the initial concentration pdf , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the initial probabilities / fractions of pristine gas and pollutants , respectively , and @xmath70 from normalization .    before introducing closure models for the diffusivity term",
    ", we discuss the evolution of the concentration variance , which helps reveal the general physics of turbulent mixing . in terms of the density - weighted pdf ,",
    "the average concentration with density weighting is written as @xmath71 , which is equal to @xmath72 .",
    "similarly , the density - weighted variance is expressed as @xmath73 , which is equivalent to @xmath74 with @xmath75 being the fluctuating part of the concentration field .",
    "taking the 2nd - order moment of eq .",
    "( [ simplepdfeq ] ) yields @xmath76 , which can also be derived directly from the advection diffusion equation using the assumption of statistically homogeneity ( see ps10 ) . we therefore have , @xmath77 the mixing timescale , @xmath78 , is the ratio of the concentration variance to its dissipation rate , @xmath79 clearly , @xmath80 is the timescale for the variance decay , and thus also characterizes the rate at which the diffusivity term reduces the pdf width .",
    "as discussed in  2 , the mixing timescale , @xmath78 , depends on the rate of turbulent stretching , which produces concentration structures at small scales and feeds molecular diffusivity with large concentration gradients . in the classical phenomenology for turbulent mixing ,",
    "the continuous production of small - scale structures is described as a cascade , in the sense that the process proceeds progressively faster toward smaller scales .",
    "the picture is similar to the cascade of kinetic energy .",
    "it predicts that the mixing timescale is determined mainly by the eddy turnover time at the scale where the pollutants are injected , but insensitive to the small diffusion scale , where the molecular diffusivity acts to homogenize .",
    "the prediction has been confirmed by pp10 using simulated supersonic turbulent flows with solenoidal driving force .",
    "they found that , at all mach numbers explored , the mixing time was close to the eddy turnover time at the pollutant injection scale , suggesting that the cascade picture , originally proposed for mixing in incompressible flows , is valid also for highly compressible turbulence .",
    "ps10 also found that compressible modes in solenoidally - driven supersonic turbulence do not make a significant contribution to the cascade of concentration structures to small scales .",
    "compressible modes consist of both expansions and compressions .",
    "as passive scalars simply follow the flow motions , the compression events would decrease the length scale of the concentration structures , or equivalently increase the concentration gradients .",
    "this makes a contribution to enhance the mixing rate . on the other hand",
    ", the expansion events would cause the mixing process to slow down .",
    "the two opposite effects tend to counteract each other . however , they do not exactly cancel out , and the effect of compressions appear to win slightly . using the density fluctuations as a measure for the strength of the compression events , pp10 found that , in solenoidally driven flows , the net contribution of compressible modes to the enhancement of the concentration gradients is much smaller than the solenoidal modes ( see  5 of pp10 ) .",
    "a limitation in the effect of compressible modes on mixing is that the squeezing effect by compressions is not continuous due to the gas pressure .",
    "it is likely a compressed region would expand before being squeezed by a second compression event .",
    "such limitation does not exist in the stretching by solenoidal modes , which operates continuous and unlimited by the gas pressure .",
    "the stretching effect by incompressible modes appears to be the primary  mixer \" in the simulated flows with solenoidal driving at all mach numbers . as a consequence , a useful measure for the mixing efficiency would be the fraction of energy contained in solenoidal modes in the inertial range of the flow , which is responsible for the cascade of passive scalars toward the diffusion scale .",
    "a statistical analysis of the simulated velocity fields by pp10 showed that the solenoidal energy fraction in the inertial range decreases with @xmath11 for @xmath81 and then saturates at an equipartition value of 2/3 at @xmath82 .",
    "this provides a satisfactory explanation for the behavior of the mixing timescale normalized to the flow dynamical time as a function of @xmath11 . the normalized mixing timescale increases with @xmath11 for @xmath81 and saturates at larger @xmath11 .",
    "this finding supports our argument above that compressible modes are less efficient at enhancing mixing in solenoidally driven flows , and , with a larger fraction of compressible energy in the inertial range , the mixing is slower .    it remains to be checked if the normalized timescale as a function of @xmath11 has the same behavior in supersonic turbulence with completely compressive driving .",
    "one issue is that , quantitatively , the energy fraction of solenoidal or compressible modes at inertial - range scales as a function of @xmath11 in fully - developed flows with compressive driving may be different from the solenoidal case .",
    "second , as shown in federrath et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , at the same @xmath11 , the density fluctuations in a compressively driven flow are much stronger .",

    "a variety of closure models have been developed for the diffusivity term in the pdf equation .",

    "here we give a brief introduction of the convolution models , and refer the interested reader to pss for details .",
    "there has been compelling evidence that the dominant scalar structures at small scales are 2d sheets or edges ( e.g. , pan and scannapieco 2011 and references therein ) .",
    "the rate at which the scalar sheets are produced is determined mainly by the turbulent stretching rate at large length scales . with time , the sheets become thinner , and once the thickness of the sheets is sufficiently small for molecular diffusivity to efficiently operate , the neighboring sheets are homogenized , leading to a reduction in the pdf width .    the physical picture outlined above can be approximately described by an integral equation for the concentration pdf , @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote the concentrations in two nearby sheets prior to the mixing by molecular diffusivity , and the delta function in the integrand arises from the assumption that a perfect homogenization occurs instantaneously once two scalar sheets are sufficiently stretched for molecular diffusivity to take effect .",

    "another weakness of the convolution pdf models with double integral equations is that , for mixing in incompressible flows , they substantially overestimate the pdf tails at late times ( kolleman 1990 )",

    "to study turbulent mixing , we evolved a number of decaying scalar fields in the four simulated flows . in each flow , we solved the advection equations of all scalar fields starting at the same time after the flow had already become fully developed and statistically stationary .",
    "the initial condition of the scalar fields was taken to be bimodal , consisting of pure pollutants and completely unpolluted material only . such a bimodal field",
    "was obtained by setting the pollutant concentration , @xmath142 , to unity in selected regions , representing pure pollutants , and to zero in the rest of the simulation box , corresponding to the unpolluted flow .",

    "i.e. , a larger value of @xmath69 , one would expect a faster pollution of the pristine gas .",
    "the mixing / pollution timescale also depends on how the pollutants are spatially distributed in the flow . for illustration ,",
    "let us consider two different distribution patterns for the same amount of pollutants .",

    "we also made an attempt to investigate a smaller value ( @xmath158 ) of @xmath69 , which would also be interesting for mixing in the interstellar medium of early galaxies .",
    "however , a tiny @xmath69 corresponds to a small pollutant size , and due to the limited numerical resolution , the pollutant size for @xmath159 is too close to the resolution scale of our simulations . in that case ,",

    "this is expected to lie within the inertial range of interstellar turbulence .",
    "therefore , the real homogenization of fresh metals from supernovae by molecular diffusivity must wait for turbulent stretching to bring the concentration structures to the diffusion scale , which is tiny in comparison to the remnant size .",
    "it is thus appropriate to consider pollutants with initial sizes significantly larger than the diffusion / resolution scale of the turbulent flow , and in the present work we do not explore scalar cases with @xmath162 .",

    "since a passive scalar simply follows the flow velocity , an expanding region tends to produce coherent and smooth structures at large scales .",
    "we note that the scalar in the supersonic flow has a smoother appearance also at small scales , and the likely reason is that the code used in our simulations applies a larger effective numerical diffusion to stabilize stronger stocks in flows with larger @xmath11 .",

    "supporting this interpretation is the fact that the degree of non - gaussianity of the velocity field increases as @xmath11 increases or as @xmath13 decreases , which coincides with the trend of the pdf tails of passive scalars .",

    "( [ pdf ] ) , it appears that the pdf tail of scalar 5b in the mach 6.2 flow is less broad than in the mach 0.9 flow .",
    "a possible reason is that the measurement of the pdfs of decaying scalars is less precise than in the case of forced scalars , for which the pdfs can be computed by averaging over many snapshots .",
    "simulations with higher resolutions may help us establish a robust trend for the pdf tail of decaying scalars in turbulent flows at large @xmath11 , as they provide better statistics and better resolution of complexities , such as strong density fluctuations , in highly supersonic turbulence .    finally , we stress that the pristine fraction corresponds to the probability contained in the far left tail of the pdf with @xmath187 , which is beyond the range of @xmath26 values shown in fig .",

    "this fraction saturates at an equipartition value of 1/3 , and the mixing timescale becomes essentially constant .",

    "this physical picture also provides an explanation for the scale dependence of the mixing timescale found by de avillez and mac low ( 2002 ) in a suite of numerical simulations of mixing in supernova - driven interstellar turbulence .",

    "therefore , using an average stretching rate for all the pollutant blobs may not give a precise prediction .",
    "the overall pollution rate depends on the turbulent stretching rates  seen \" by all the pollutants at early times .",
    "the blobs encountering more intense eddies provide a larger contribution to the pollution process , and vice versa .",
    "the effect is further amplified by the phenomenon of intermittency : the pdf of the stretching intensity exhibits fatter tails toward smaller scales .",
    "therefore , the small blobs have large chance to encounter extreme stretching events .",
    "clearly , the effect of intermittency makes it more difficult to predict the pristine fraction for scalar fields with smaller @xmath69 .",
    "we point out that , for a given scalar field , the parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath226 , that can fit scalar fields with @xmath208 or the late phases of @xmath256 cases are not unique .",
    "in fact , a ( small ) range of parameter pairs ( @xmath7 , @xmath226 ) can give acceptable fits to the simulation data .",
    "for example , if a somewhat smaller ( larger ) @xmath7 is used , one could also have a similar fit with correspondingly smaller ( larger ) value of @xmath226 .",
    "when obtaining the best - fit parameters , we attempted to select a single value of @xmath7 that provides good fits to all scalar fields in each category . with the chosen @xmath7",
    ", we then determine the best - fit value of @xmath226 for each scalar field in the category .",
    "as discussed above , the timescale turns out to be similar for all cases in a given category .        a comparison of figs .",
    "( [ mach0.9four ] ) and ( [ mach6.2four ] ) shows that , when the time is normalized to the flow dynamical timescale , the pristine fraction in the mach 6.2 flow survives for significantly longer than in the mach 0.9 case ( see also pss ) .",
    "we discuss this mach number dependence in the following subsection .      in fig .",
    "( [ machdependence ] ) , we show the evolution of the pristine fraction for scalar fields 3b ( left ) and 3c ( right ) in our four simulated flows .",
    "as observed earlier , with @xmath40 normalized to the flow dynamical time , @xmath140 , the decrease of the pristine fraction becomes slower with increasing mach number . in the fitting lines for case 3b ( left panel ) ,",
    "the parameter pair ( @xmath7 , @xmath226 ) is set to ( 10 , 0.26@xmath140 ) , ( 6 , 0.29 @xmath140 ) , ( 5 , 0.31@xmath140 ) , and ( 3 , 0.31@xmath140 ) for the four flows with @xmath141 , 2.1 , 3.5 , and 6.2 , respectively .",
    "again , we see that @xmath226 first increases with @xmath11 and then saturates for @xmath82 .",
    "this trend is similar to that of the variance decay timescale , @xmath78 , as a function of @xmath11 ( see the top panel of fig .",
    "( [ var ] ) ) . as explained in  5.3 , @xmath78 increases as the energy fraction in compressible modes increases and then becomes roughly constant when compressible energy fraction saturates at @xmath257 .",
    "the same reasoning also applies here for the trend of @xmath226 with @xmath11 .",
    "similar to the discussion in  5.3 on @xmath78 , the convolution timescale may have a different behavior with @xmath11 in compressively driven flows .    in  5.2",
    ", we showed that , at a similar concentration variance , the pdf tail becomes broader as @xmath11 increases , most likely because of a the increase in turbulent intermittency .",
    "because the pristine fraction corresponds to the far left tail of the concentration pdf , the effect also slows the pristine gas pollution at larger @xmath11 .",
    "another effect of the broadening of the pdf tail with increasing @xmath11 is that it changes the shape of the pristine fraction vs. time curve , as seen in fig .",
    "( [ machdependence ] ) . to fit the pristine fraction in flows at different @xmath11 , we varied the parameter , @xmath7 , in the self - convolution model , which controls the shape of the fitting function , eq .",
    "( [ pfnconvsolution ] ) .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath7 decreases from 10 to 3 as @xmath11 increases from 0.9 to 6.2 .",
    "this decrease of @xmath7 is expected from the fact that the self - convolution model with smaller @xmath7 would predict broader pdf tails ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "the convolution model was originally proposed for mixing in incompressible turbulence , where @xmath7 was a pure parameter without a clear connection to the mixing physics .",
    "our finding that the convolution model with properly chosen @xmath7 can well describe the pristine fraction evolution in compressible turbulent flows motivates a physical interpretation of the parameter .",
    "a possible intuitive reason for why @xmath7 decreases with the flow mach number is that @xmath7 reflects the degree of spatial locality of the pdf convolution , with more local mixing events implying a smaller @xmath7 . in a highly supersonic turbulence ,",
    "the majority of the flow mass resides in a small fraction of volume , i.e. , in the dense postshock regions .",
    "therefore , mixing of the pollutants into and within local regions of high densities is crucial toward the final homogenization .",
    "the dense postshock regions are persistent with a lifetime on the order of the flow dynamical time , and the time scale for the homogenization between different postshock regions is expected to be on the same order .",
    "this suggests that the presence of local dense regions may suppress the possibility of a global pdf convolution . in that case , as the flow mach number increases , the convolution would become more local , leading to a decrease in @xmath7 .",
    "based on this argument , we speculate that , in compressively driven flows at similar @xmath11 , the parameter @xmath7 would be smaller than in our simulated flows .",
    "the convolution in a compressively driven flow is expected to be more local because the density fluctuations are stronger ( e.g. , federrath et al .",

    "( [ machdependence ] ) plots the results for case 3 c with @xmath258 in the four simulated flows .",
    "again the decrease of the pristine fraction is slower in flows with larger @xmath11 .",
    "as discussed earlier , a two - phase fitting scenario is needed for scalar fields with @xmath227 . using the discrete convolution model to fit the early - phase evolution , we find that the timescale @xmath225 is 0.17 , 0.19 , 0.22 and 0.23 @xmath140 for @xmath141 , 2.1 , 3.5 and 6.2 , respectively .",
    "the two phases are connected at @xmath229 .",
    "note that the timescale @xmath225 also increases with @xmath11 at first and then saturates for @xmath82 . for the late phase of scalar case 3 c",
    ", we adopted the same values of @xmath7 ( i.e. , 10 , 6 , 5 , and 3 ) for the flows as used in the case of 3 b. to match the simulation data , @xmath226 in the late phase is set to 0.25 , 0.30 , 0.34 and 0.34 @xmath140 for @xmath141 , 2.1 , 3.5 and 6.2 , respectively .",
    "again , these numbers are close to the best - fit values for case 3 b shown in the left panel .    in summary",
    ", we found that the pollution of the pristine gas is slower in flows at higher @xmath11 .",
    "two reasons are responsible for this behavior .",
    "first , the mixing ( or variance decay ) timescale @xmath78 becomes larger as @xmath11 increases .",
    "second , at the same concentration variance , the left pdf tail broadens with @xmath259 and this corresponds to a larger pristine fraction .",
    "next , we study the dependence of the pristine fraction evolution on the initial spatial configuration of the pollutants , i.e. , on how the pollutants are released into the flow .",
    "each category in table 1 represents a different pollutant shape or distribution at the initial time . in fig .",
    "( [ lengthscale ] ) , we compare the simulation results for scalar fields from different categories in the mach 6.2 flow .",
    "the left panel shows five b fields with @xmath184 , and the right panel is for c cases with @xmath258 .",
    "the initial condition for the scalar fields in categories 1  and 2  is a single pollutant cube and a single spherical blob , respectively , and the pristine fraction evolution for scalar fields in these two categories is almost the same , suggesting the geometric shape of the pollutant blob does not affect the pollution rate .    on the other hand",
    ", the pollution process has a sensitive dependence on on the injection length scale , @xmath13 . for scalar fields in first two categories ( 1  and 2 ) ,",
    "@xmath13 is about equal to the box size , or twice the flow driving scale , @xmath144 . for categories 3 , 4  and 5 , @xmath191 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 , respectively , as expected in  4 , the decay of the pristine fraction becomes progressively faster with decreasing @xmath13 .",
    "the four lines in each panel of fig .",
    "( [ lengthscale ] ) are fitting functions based on the self - convolution models . since the data points almost coincide for scalar fields in categories 1  and 2 , a single fitting curve ( the line on the right ) works for both cases .",
    "the other three fitting lines , from the right to the left , correspond to scalar fields in categories 3 , 4 , and 5 respectively .",
    "the fitting parameters used for the b fields in the left panel are @xmath262 and 1 , and @xmath263 and @xmath264 , respectively , for the four lines from the right to the left .",
    "the timescale @xmath226 decreases by @xmath265 as @xmath13 changes from @xmath266 to @xmath144 , and , as@xmath13 decreases further below @xmath144 , the decrease of @xmath226 is faster , dropping by @xmath267 for each factor of 2 in @xmath13 .",
    "this trend is similar to the dependence of the variance decay timescale , @xmath78 , on @xmath268 which is controlled by the eddy turnover time at @xmath269 and decreases with decreasing @xmath13 .",
    "this also explains the faster pollution of the pristine gas if the pollutants are injected at smaller scales . recalling that @xmath78 was measured to be @xmath270 and 0.34 @xmath140 for the same b fields in the mach 6.2 flow with @xmath271 and 0.25@xmath144 , respectively ( see the mid panel of fig .",
    "[ var ] ) , we see that @xmath226 has a more sensitive dependence on @xmath13 than @xmath78 .",
    "a possible reason for this is that the exposure of the pollutants to the pristine flow may be an important factor for the pollution efficiency , and , with decreasing @xmath13 , the number of pollutant blobs increases rapidly , leading to enhanced pollutant exposure .",
    "the trend that @xmath7 becomes smaller for scalars injected at smaller scales corresponds to broadening of the pdf tails with decreasing @xmath13 found in  5.2 .",
    "the pdf tails become broader because the flow structures  seen \" by the scalars with smaller @xmath13 are more intermittent , and thus the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath13 is related to the higher degree of turbulent intermittency at smaller scales . if the turbulent flow is driven compressively , the decrease of @xmath7 with decreasing @xmath13 may be faster due to stronger intermittency of the flow .",
    "note that broadening of the pdf tails makes the pristine fraction larger , but this effect is minor in comparison to the faster decrease of the pristine fraction caused by the smaller mixing timescale at smaller @xmath13 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath7 with decreasing @xmath13 may also be understood from a more intuitive argument .    for scalar fields with a small @xmath13 , each pollutant is stretched by a local velocity structure , and the mixing of each pollutant blob with the surrounding flow proceeds largely independently at early times .",
    "the pollution process is almost complete when the mixed areas by the pollutant blobs start to overlap ( see bottom panels of fig .  1 ) , meaning that the pdf convolution occurs locally and independently in different regions of size @xmath13 during most of the mixing process .",
    "as the injection scale decreases , the pdf convolution becomes more local , leading to a smaller value of @xmath7 , which corresponds to a higher degree of spatial locality in the pdf convolution ( see  3.1 ) .    for c fields shown in the right panel ,",
    "a two - phase scenario connecting at @xmath229 is used to obtain the fitting lines . in the early phase ,",
    "the timescale , @xmath225 , in the discrete convolution model is taken to be 0.30 , 0.24 , 0.17 , and 0.1 @xmath140 , respectively , for the four fitting lines from right to left .",
    "the dependence of @xmath225 is similar to that of @xmath226 for the b cases .",
    "it is first reduced by 20% , as @xmath13 decreases to @xmath144 , and then decreases faster , by @xmath272 , as @xmath13 decreases further by each factor of 2 .",
    "for the late phase , we adopted the same values ( 5 , 3 , 2 and 1 ) of @xmath7 as for the corresponding b cases shown in the left panel , and @xmath226 is set to @xmath273 , 0.22 , and 0.12 @xmath140 for scalar fields with @xmath274 , 1 , 0.5 and @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "again , these values of @xmath226 are close to those used in the fitting lines for the corresponding b cases .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for case 5c , @xmath15 is adopted in both the early and late phases , although the timescales @xmath275 and @xmath276 are slightly different .",
    "we also examined the @xmath13 dependence for all the other scalar fields including those in the other three flows .",
    "we found similar trends for the parameters , @xmath7 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 , with varying pollutant injection scale .",
    "the results are tabulated and further discussed in  5.4.6 .",
    "when presenting simulation results in earlier subsections , we set the threshold metallicity to @xmath277 as a representative value , but , as discussed in the introduction , the threshold value for the transition to normal star formation is uncertain .",
    "we therefore need to study the dependence of the pristine fraction @xmath25 on the @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "( [ threshdependence ] ) , we plot @xmath25 at different threshold values for scalar 3c in the mach 6.2 flow .",
    "the two panels show the same figure on linear - linear and linear - log scales , respectively .",

    "( [ threshdependence ] ) correspond to the fraction of exactly pristine flow material with @xmath64 .",
    "this fraction decreases to zero almost instantaneously .",
    "this is caused by the effect of numerical diffusion . during each timestep",
    ", any computational cell adjacent to one that contains pollutants or has been polluted by earlier mixing events will obtain a finite , but often extremely small concentration .",

    "there is also a general trend that the increase of the convolution timescale with the threshold becomes faster as @xmath4 increases to the highest value , @xmath106 , considered in our study .    the weak power - law dependence of the convolution timescales , @xmath225 and @xmath226 , on @xmath4 may extend to a range of threshold values below @xmath285 , although as @xmath294",

    ", the weak power - law scaling will also break down eventually . as pointed out above",
    ", the increase of the convolution timescales is already faster as @xmath4 increases to @xmath106 .",

    "a more extreme example is that , if @xmath4 is larger than @xmath297 , @xmath25 would first decrease when the pollutants mix with a small amount of the flow material , and then increase and finally approach unity when the flow is completely homogenized .",

    "we defer it to a later work . in the case of @xmath300 ,",

    "another motivation is that , at a given ratio @xmath302 , @xmath25 samples a concentration range at a similar distance to the central part of the pdf .",
    "thus , in  5.4.6 , we tabulate the fitting parameters for the evolution of @xmath25 with @xmath303 as functions of the flow mach number and the pollutant injection scale . for other values of @xmath302 , the timescales , @xmath225 and @xmath226",

    "as discussed in  3.2 , the timescale for the pollution of the pristine gas to a significant concentration level is mainly determined by the rate at which turbulence stretches the pollutants , and independent of the amplitude of the molecular or numerical diffusion if it is sufficiently small to allow a scale separation between the pollutant injection scale and the diffusion scale . to verify this expectation",
    ", we carried out @xmath163 simulations and compared them with the results from @xmath164 runs . the scale separation mentioned above exists at both resolutions , but",
    "the separation is limited for the @xmath163 runs .",

    "the fitting curves for the @xmath163 data are obtained with the same fitting scenario as in the @xmath164 case . in both the mach 0.9 and 6.2 flows ,",
    "the pristine fraction for the two scalar fields with @xmath201 ( 3a ) and @xmath307 ( 3b ) is smaller in the @xmath163 runs .",
    "in fact , the fraction becomes smaller than in the @xmath164 runs almost immediately after the pollutants are released into the flows .",
    "this can be explained by considering the action of numerical diffusion on the initial concentration field . since our initial concentration field",
    "consists of pure pollutants ( @xmath308 ) and exactly pristine gas ( @xmath309 ) , there exist sharp edges between the pollutant blobs and the pristine flow .",
    "numerical diffusion may operate on the large concentration gradient at the edges , and a fraction of the flow material surrounding the pollutants would be polluted immediately .",
    "this results in an instantaneous drop in the pristine fraction . in the @xmath164 runs , the effect was found to be weak , and the initial drop was slight .",
    "the drop is significantly larger in the @xmath163 simulations due to the larger numerical diffusion , leading to smaller pristine fractions for scalars 3a and 3b in the @xmath163 runs than in the @xmath164 cases .    recognizing this effect of initial drop",
    ", we adjusted the initial pristine fraction , @xmath68 , to smaller values when fitting the 256@xmath131 data .",
    "for scalar fields 3a and 3b , we used the same values of @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath210 and 3 for @xmath141 and 6.2 , respectively ) as in the corresponding @xmath164 cases . with the adjusted values of @xmath68 , the best - fit timescales",
    "@xmath226 for these two cases in the @xmath163 runs differ slightly , only by @xmath310 , from those used to fit the @xmath164 data .",
    "this is the case for both mach 0.9 and mach 6.2 flows .",
    "therefore , except for the initial drop , the numerical resolution does not affect how the pristine fraction evolves for the two fields with @xmath208 , and one may claim a numerical convergence of the convolution timescale .",
    "note that , in realistic interstellar turbulence , the effect of the initial drop would be minimal because the molecular diffusivity is much smaller than the numerical diffusion in our simulations .",
    "also the sharp pollutant - flow edges in the simulations are artificial and may not exist in reality .",
    "the dependence on numerical resolution is more complicated for cases 3c and 3d with @xmath311 and @xmath312 respectively . as seen in fig .",
    "( [ resolutiondependence ] ) , the pristine fraction decay in the @xmath163 runs can be either faster or slower than in the @xmath164 simulations .",
    "the stronger initial drop in the @xmath163 runs still exists in the early evolution phases .",
    "however , unlike scalar fields with @xmath313 , it is not the dominant effect .",
    "the velocity field at a given location in the @xmath163 and @xmath164 simulations is different ( see above ) , and thus the same pollutant blob may encounter very different velocity structures in the two runs . as discussed earlier , for cases with small @xmath69 ,",
    "the pollutant size is small , and the turbulent stretching rate around the blobs would show larger variations . therefore , the stretching rate in the eddy across a small pollutant blob may deviate significantly from the mean value at that scale . since the flow mass polluted by an individual blob scales nonlinearly with the local stretching rate , the overall pollution rate for scalar fields with tiny @xmath69 can not be predicted by an average stretching rate , instead it depends on the distribution of the stretching rates over all the pollutant blobs .",
    "this is different from the case of @xmath224 fields with large pollutant sizes , where the amplitude of the stretching rate fluctuations is smaller and the stretching rate for each blob is similar and equal to the average value .",
    "thus , the pollution for scalar cases with small @xmath69 ( @xmath314 ) is more sensitive to the details of the stretching rates encountered by all the blobs .",
    "if the overall stretching rates in the eddies  seen \" by the pollutant blobs in the @xmath163 run is relatively higher , the pollution would proceed relatively faster than the @xmath164 run and vice versa .",
    "it appears that the origin of the observed difference at late times is stochastic and has nothing to do with the numerical diffusion / resolution .",
    "the above picture also suggests that the difference may become larger as @xmath69 decreases further below 0.001 .    when fitting the early phases of cases 3c and 3d in the @xmath163 flows , we decreased @xmath68 to account for the initial drop . in the @xmath141 flow , @xmath225 for the early phases of these two cases are close to those used to fit the @xmath164 data , and the difference is at the level of @xmath315 .",

    "the data points from the @xmath163 and @xmath164 runs almost coincide , and we do not give a separate fit to the @xmath163 data .",
    "it appears that the resolution dependence of the best - fit parameters is quite weak .    in summary , we find that the larger numerical diffusion in the @xmath163 simulations causes a larger initial drop in the pristine fraction .",
    "this effect is successfully accounted by adjusting the value of @xmath68 in our model fits to the simulation results .",
    "the effect is expected to be negligibly weak in the interstellar gas where the molecular diffusivity is tiny . for scalar fields with small @xmath227 ,",

    "based our results in  5.4.4 , for small values of @xmath547 ( @xmath549 ) , one can use a weak power - law scaling ( see  5.4.4 ) to rescale the convolution timescales listed in tables 2 and 4 .",
    "however , it is possible that @xmath501 in a computational cell is close to or even smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "as discussed in  5.4.4 , in the extreme case with @xmath550 , the evolution of @xmath526 in a cell would be qualitatively different from the prediction of the self convolution models .",
    "a careful treatment is thus needed for cells with @xmath501 close or smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "how the fraction , @xmath526 , evolves under this situation is not explored in the current work , and we defer it to a future paper .    in the subgrid model outlined above for the pristine fraction",
    ", we adopted a simple approach to fix the model parameters , prescribing them based on our simulation results and previous work on les .",
    "an interesting question is whether the parameters can be determined dynamically using the resolved local flow and scalar structures .",
    "it seems highly uncertain whether the dynamic procedure is applicable at all to the problem of how the pristine gas is polluted in a turbulent flow . as mentioned earlier , the validity of the dynamical procedure relies on the existence of scale invariance .",
    "this can be justified , e.g. , for the cascade of kinetic energy or the concentration variance , based on kolmogorov s similarity theory of turbulence . however , unlike kinetic energy or the scalar variance , which are 2nd - order statistical measures , the pristine fraction corresponds to the extreme pdf tail , and it is unknown whether scale invariance exists for such a high - order quantity . exploring the possibility of developing a dynamic subgrid model for the pristine gas fraction would be an interesting topic for a future study .",
    "the shift from population iii to normal star formation is a global transition of the universe that is dependent on mixing on scales smaller than a parsec ( pan & scalo 2007 ) .",
    "this means that numerical simulations of this process will only be possible if we first develop a deep understanding of the fundamental physics of how the pristine material is polluted in turbulent flows . in an earlier paper ( pss )",
    ", we developed a theoretical approach to modeling this process based on the pdf method for passive scalar mixing in statistically homogeneous turbulence , and we explored the evolution of the pristine fraction , @xmath25 , defined as the mass fraction of the flow with pollutant concentration below a tiny threshold @xmath4 .",
    "then we used numerical simulations to show that a class of pdf models , called self - convolution models , provide successful fitting functions to the solution of @xmath551 which corresponds to the far left tail of the concentration pdf .",
    "the convolution models are based on the physical picture of turbulence stretching pollutants and causing a cascade of concentration structures toward small scales .",
    "mixing then occurs as the scale of the structures becomes sufficiently small for molecular diffusivity to operate efficiently , and the homogenization between neighboring structures corresponds to a convolution of the concentration pdf .",
    "the picture suggests that the mixing / pollution timescale is determined by the turbulent stretching rate at the scale where the pollutants are injected , and the main result of pss was the prediction for the pristine fraction evolution , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ pfnconv ] ) , by the generalized self - convolution model . for convenience",
    ", we repeat eq .",
    "( [ pfnconv ] ) here , @xmath552 where @xmath8 is the timescale for the pdf convolution , and the parameter @xmath7 is interpreted as an indicator of the degree of spatial locality of the pdf convolution process .",
    "a smaller @xmath7 corresponds to more local convolution and broader pdf tails .    in the present work",
    ", we briefly reviewed the formulation of pss , and conducted a systematic numerical study of the turbulent pollution process , exploring an extended parameter space .",
    "we simulated four statistically homogeneous turbulent flows with rms mach number @xmath11 ranging from @xmath334 to @xmath193 . in each flow",
    ", we evolved 20 decaying scalars with different initial pollutant fractions , @xmath69 , and different pollutant injection scales , @xmath553 .",
    "the simulation data further confirmed the validity of the convolution model and allowed us to measure the model parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in eq .",
    "( [ pfnconvconc ] ) over a wide range of turbulence and pollutant conditions .",
    "consistent with pss , we find that , if the initial pollutant fraction @xmath224 , the simulation results for the pristine fraction can be well fit by the convolution model prediction , eq .",

    "( [ pfnconvsolutionconc ] ) to fit the simulation data yielded best - fit parameters @xmath7 and @xmath226 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath241 , the evolution of @xmath25 shows different behaviors at early and late times . in the early phase , the pdf convolution occurs locally in space due to the limited amount of pollutants , and the pristine fraction evolution follows the prediction of the  discrete \" convolution model with @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath555 where the convolution timescale for the early phase is denoted as @xmath225 .",
    "once a significant fraction ( 0.2 - 0.3 ) of flow is polluted , the pristine fraction evolves in the same way as the scalar fields with @xmath556 .",
    "we therefore named the convolution timescale as @xmath226 for both scalars with @xmath224 and the late phases of @xmath557 scalars ( see  5.4 ) .",
    "a successful two - phase fitting scenario was adopted for scalars fields with @xmath557 , which connects eqs .",
    "( [ pfintegralsolutionconc ] ) and ( [ pfnconvsolutionconc ] ) for early and late times .",
    "we examined the dependence of the model parameters on the flow mach number , @xmath11 .",
    "we found that the convolution timescales , @xmath225 and @xmath226 , normalized to the flow dynamical time increase by @xmath558 as @xmath11 goes from 0.9 to 2.1 and then saturates at @xmath559 .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of the variance decay timescale , @xmath78 , as a function of @xmath11 . for @xmath224 scalars or the late phase of scalars with @xmath241 , the parameter @xmath7 decreases with increasing @xmath11 , indicating that the pdf convolution proceeds more locally in supersonic turbulence with larger @xmath11 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath7 is related to broader concentration pdf tails at higher @xmath11 , corresponding to a larger pristine fraction at the same concentration variance .",
    "the pristine fraction evolution also depends on the pollutant injection scale @xmath553 .",
    "as @xmath553 deceases , the pollution of the pristine gas is faster and the timescales , @xmath225 and @xmath226 , decrease .",
    "this is expected as the mixing timescale scales with the eddy turnover time at @xmath553 . for scalars with @xmath224 or",

    "we showed that the model is valid for @xmath560 , where @xmath225 and @xmath226 only have a weak dependence on @xmath4 (  5.4.4 ) .",
    "if @xmath4 is close to or larger than @xmath297 , the model is no longer applicable , and we defer a study of this situation to a later work .",
    "we also tested the convergence of the model parameters with the numerical resolution (  5.4.5 ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 may have a dependence on the compressivity of the driving force , which will be systematically examined in a future work .    to apply our model and simulation results to the mixing of heavy elements in the interstellar medium , we specified the source term in the concentration pdf equation , accounting for the effects of new metals from supernova explosions and the possible infall of pristine gas from the halo or the intergalactic medium .",
    "these two sources force spikes in the pdf at high and low concentration values , respectively . with the source term , we derived an equation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : pfgalaxy ] ) ) for the global pristine fraction in early galaxies .",
    "a description for how to use the equation and our simulation results to estimate the primordial gas fraction was given in  6 .",
    "we discussed the timescales of relevant processes that control how and how fast the pollution process proceeds .",
    "in particular , the spatial transport by turbulent motions over galactic scales may play an important role if the interstellar turbulence is driven at small scales , e.g. , by supernova explosions .",
    "numerical simulations accounting for the interstellar environment at galactic scales are a valuable tool to study the pollution of primordial gas from a less idealized point of view .",
    "in fact , recent efforts to track metal mixing in the context of the formation of protogalaxies have made significant improvements in tracking the spatial evolution of the metallicity , averaged over relatively large scales ( e.g. , wise & abel 2008 ) .",
    "greif ( 2009 , 2010 ) employed a turbulent diffusion formalism to mimic mixing by smoothing over the sph kernel , and a similar approach was used in the 10 mpc sph simulations by maio ( 2010 ) and campisi ( 2011 ) , who assumed the initial metal pollution was spread over @xmath561 kpc scales by cluster winds .",
    "another recent simulation by ritter ( 2012 ) used a finite - difference code with adaptive mesh refinement coupled to lagrangian tracer particles to keep track of the metals produced in an initially metal - free galaxy .",
    "interestingly , they found that a cold supersonically turbulent core developed because of the fallback of metal - enhanced ejecta .",
    "however , because the resolution scale was much larger than the scales on which turbulence - enhanced molecular diffusivity operates ( pan & scalo 2007 ) , they could not resolve a sufficiently large range of scales to track the unmixed , primordial fraction .",
    "to overcome limitations such as these , we have developed a large - eddy simulation ( les ) approach based on our model and simulation results . in",
    "less , the flow quantities at resolved scales are directly computed , while the feedback effect of subgrid turbulent motions is modeled . to overcome the over - pollution by numerical diffusion ,",
    "a subgrid model was constructed to track the evolution of the concentration fluctuations below the resolution scale . using the standard filtering procedure for the les formulation , we derived an equation for the filtered concentration pdf representing metallicity fluctuations at subgrid scales , and discussed the treatment of each term in the equation .",
    "the core of our subgrid model is equation ( [ filteredprimordial ] ) for the filtered pristine fraction ( i.e. , the pristine fraction in each computational cell ) , which was derived from the filtered pdf equation .",
    "again , we repeat it here for convenience : @xmath562 where @xmath535 and @xmath536 are parameters for the subgrid pollution , corresponding to @xmath7 and @xmath563 in our convolution model , @xmath531 is the eddy diffusivity for the pristine fraction , @xmath517 is the filtered number rate of supernova explosions per unit volume and each supernova is assumed to have an ejecta mass @xmath355 .",
    "this equation adopts the commonly - used eddy - diffusivity model for the transport effect of subgrid turbulent motions , and employs the convolution model for the pollution of the pristine gas within each cell .",
    "the implementation of our subgrid model was illustrated in the context of a one - equation les model for the interstellar turbulence , which evolves the kinetic energy of subgrid turbulent motions .",
    "together with the resolved temperature field , the subgrid kinetic energy specifies the turbulence properties in each cell , which are needed to calculate the eddy - diffusivity in the transport term and to determine the parameters in the convolution model for the subgrid pollution .",
    "the convolution model parameters depend on the metal / supernova sources in each cell , and can be evaluated using our simulation results .    the resulting physically - realistic model for the evolution of the unresolved primordial fraction serves as a prototype for future simulations aimed at interpreting many observations currently probing the nature of early galaxies . the continuing discovery of star - forming galaxies at @xmath564 in broad - band photometric searches , for example , ( as in the hubble udf12 survey , ellis 2013 ) suggests that observations of galaxies with significant primordial fractions should soon become available .",
    "the situation for galaxies selected on the basis of strong ly@xmath565 emission ( cowie & hu 1998 ; rhoads 2000 ) is even more promising , and it may only be a matter of time before several such galaxies are clearly identified as containing primordial stars recognizable by their large ly@xmath565 equivalent width and weak he ii emission ( scannapieco 2003 ; jimenez & haiman 2006 ) .",
    "in fact , a recent detailed analysis of deep subaru images by inoue ( 2011 ) strongly supports the interpretation that the mass fraction of stellar populations with extremely small metal abundances in @xmath566 lyman alpha emitters may be 1 - 10 % by mass , based on their very strong rest frame lyman continua .",
    "based on similar diagnostics , kashikawa et al .",
    "( 2012 ) recently proposed a @xmath567 ly@xmath565 emitter as a pop iii candidate although enhanced ly@xmath565 emission from a clumpy , dusty medium ( neufeld 1991 ; hansen & oh 2006 ) can not be ruled out conclusively in this case .",
    "if any of these galaxies are convincingly demonstrated to contain primordial stars , their evolution could only be simulated using an approach such as the one outlined here .    currently , a more direct constraint on the evolution of primordial gas is based on the absence of metal lines in absorption line systems in the intergalactic medium .",
    "fumagalli ( 2011 ) used this approach to obtain upper limits of @xmath568 by mass in two lyman limit systems associated with quasars at @xmath569 and 3.4 .",
    "simcoe ( 2012 ) used the lack of metal lines in a @xmath570 quasar spectrum that shows a large neutral hydrogen column density to obtain an upper limit of @xmath571 depending on the whether the gas is bound in a galaxy or is diffuse intergalactic gas at that redshift .",
    "the implications of these measurements can only be fully explored through models such as ours , which capture the unresolved , unmixed fraction .    finally , at least four examples of galactic stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath572 -4.5 ( @xmath573 ) are known ( christlieb et al .",
    "2002 ; frebel et al .",
    "2008 ; norris et al .  2007 ;",
    "caffau et al .",
    "2011 ) , although only one is not enhanced in carbon .",
    "recently , yong et al .  ( 2012 ) have shown convincingly that the milky way metallicity pdf is still decreasing smoothly down to at least [ fe / h ] = -4.1 ( @xmath574 ) , without the sudden cutoff claimed in earlier work .",
    "once the rather severe selection effects are understood , this measurements could also be directly compared with our models , and even allow their two main parameters to be calibrated outside of numerical simulations .",
    "in fact , our proposed large - eddy simulation is expected to give reliable predictions for any physical problem , astrophysical our otherwise , in which the unresolved , low concentration tail of the pdf needs to be tracked . its numerical implementation and",
