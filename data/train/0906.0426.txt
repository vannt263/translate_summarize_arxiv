    "the fractal properties of network traffic were extensively studied in many literatures during the last decade .",
    "it is widely believed that the dynamic behavior of network flow under re - scaling needs to be carefully considered in performance analysis and control .",
    "there are numerous explanations and models for the origins and appearances of fractality for network traffic ; see e.g. @xcite-@xcite and the references therein . under the multi - fractality assumption for internet traffic",
    ", we propose a new flow model to explain the crossover phenomena found in the estimation of hurst exponent @xcite , @xcite ( the crossover phenomenon is defined in the next section ) .",
    "results indicate that this model help gain more insights into the actual network traffic dynamics .",
    "moreover , we can use this model to better simulate network traffic in a simple way .",
    "in data networks , the traffic flow is often viewed a certain self - similar stochastic process @xmath0 , which by definition satisfies @xcite-@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 , and @xmath3 denotes the equality of finite - dimensional distributions .",
    "@xmath4 is the so called hurst exponent .    a self - similar process with stationary increments",
    "can then be defined by multiplexing the increments @xmath5 over non - overlapping blocks of size @xmath6 as @xmath7 the aggregated process @xmath8 is called a stationary self - similar @xmath9-sss process with hurst exponent @xmath9 .",
    "it has finite - dimensional distributions similar to @xmath10 @xmath11    there are various ways to study the stochastic properties of @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite considers the cumulants of the aggregated series , which are defined as the taylor coefficients of the cumulant - generating function @xmath12 with @xmath13 . in @xcite , @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the @xmath14 order cumulants of an aggregated @xmath9-sss process usually scales as @xmath15    as pointed out in @xcite , eq.([equ:4 ] ) implies that for each @xmath16 the logarithm of the modulus of @xmath17 scales linearly with @xmath18 with slope @xmath19 as @xmath20 the simplest form of @xmath19 is a linear function of @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 in @xcite , ( [ equ:7 ] ) is called linear - fractal model , where the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 are directly estimated ( interpolated ) during the fittings to the cumulants .",
    "a special case of the linear - fractal model is the uni - fractal model @xcite@xcite , which has the form @xmath25 where @xmath9 is the corresponding hurst exponent .",
    "@xcite compared the linear - fractal model and the uni - fractal model using empirical network flow data . as shown in fig.3 and fig.4 of @xcite , although both models catch the main trends of the real data in the estimation of hurst exponent .",
    ", neither of them can perfectly match the so - called crossover phenomenon .",
    "fig.1 gives an illustration of the crossover phenomenon . in the current case the x - axis stands for @xmath18 and the y - axis stands for @xmath26 cumulant .",
    "the slope of the fitting curve crossovers from a small value to a notably larger value .",
    "therefore the curve consists of three parts : a line segment with a gentler slope when @xmath18 is small , the intermediate transition part , and another line segment with a steeper slope when @xmath18 is large .",
    "[ fig:1 ]     the crossover phenomenon can also be observed in the wavelet - based hurst coefficient estimation for network flow @xcite , @xcite . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "a self - similar process has the following power law @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a constant , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is a specially defined measuring variance on @xmath31 .",
    "eq.([equ:9 ] ) indicates that the logarithm of @xmath30 scales linearly with @xmath32 with slope @xmath33 as @xmath34 however , real flow data again exhibits the unexpected crossover phenomenon as illustrated in fig.1 , ( in this case the x - axis stands for @xmath35 and the y - axis stands for @xmath26 cumulant ) .",
    "an example can be found in fig.2.3 of @xcite .",
    "there are numerous physical models for the origin of the self - similarities in network traffic flows , but few of them can explain the crossover phenomenon .",
    "this gap calls for a finer model that accounts for the crossover phenomenon , as it will not only enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanism of the network traffic , but may also lead to improvements of network performance .",
    "our previous study @xcite shows that the pca eigen - spectrum of the mixed fbm signals with different hurst exponents may yield bi - scaling / multi - scaling behavior .",
    "inspired by that finding , we propose a mixed - fractal flow model , which reproduces the above crossover phenomena and sheds light on its origin .",
    "we assume that the network flow process @xmath36 is the sum of two independent self - similar processes @xmath37 and @xmath38 with different hurst exponents @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively : @xmath41 it is assumed that @xmath42 and thus @xmath43 , @xmath44 control the variance of the two components . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume @xmath45 .    similarly to eq .",
    "( [ equ:2 ] ) , we can define @xmath46 by multiplexing the increments @xmath47 over non - overlapping blocks of size @xmath48 as @xmath49 for the linear - fractal and uni - fratal models , we obtain by independence @xmath50 } + c_2(m ) n^{\\left [ m + 2(h_2 -1 ) \\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are partly determined by @xmath43 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "in general , a larger @xmath54 leads to a larger @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath56 , there is a unique positive solution @xmath57 ( not necessarily an integer ) for the following equation in variable @xmath6 @xmath58 } = c_2(m ) n^{\\left [ m + 2(h_2 -1 ) \\right]}\\ ] ] it is easy to find    @xmath59 } \\textrm { , for } n \\ll n^ * \\\\ c_2(m ) n^{\\left [ m + 2(h_2 -1 ) \\right ] } \\textrm { , for } n \\gg n^ * \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    therefore , for each @xmath21 , the logscale diagram of the @xmath14-order cumulants of @xmath46 consist of three parts : one line segment with slope @xmath60 when @xmath6 is small , the intermediate transition part ( which is often short ) , and another line segments with slope @xmath61 when @xmath6 is large .",
    "this is precisely the crossover phenomenon .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]    similarly , for the wavelet model , we obtain by independence @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are partly determined by @xmath43 and @xmath53 , respectively . in general",
    ", a larger @xmath54 leads to a larger @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath68 , there exists a unique positive solution @xmath69 ( not necessarily an integer ) for the following equation in variable @xmath70 @xmath71 it is easy to find    @xmath72    therefore , the logscale diagram of @xmath73 consist of three parts : one line segment with slope @xmath74 when @xmath70 is small , the intermediate transition part ( which is often short ) , and another line segments with slope @xmath75 when @xmath70 is large .",
    "an example from simulation is given in fig.3 .",
    "[ fig:3 ]   and @xmath62 are mixed with @xmath76 .",
    "we apply the matlab code from @xcite to obtain the logscale diagram here.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]    in sum , we have shown that if the traffic flow process consists of two independent additive components with different hurst exponents , we may observe the crossover phenomenon in the estimation of the hurst exponents using cumulants or wavelets .",
    "it is not hard to see that this conclusion can be extended to the case with more than two components .",
    "in this section , we would like to index the following points :    first , it is interesting to find that the inconsistence of theoretical unique - fractal value of the hurst exponent and the crossover phenomenon in real data may be resolved by a simple mixed - fractal model .",
    "moreover , to simulate the mixed - fractal model , we can generate several processes with different hurst exponents , using any of the existing methods for generating uni - fractal self - similar series , and then add them up .",
    "this is in accordance with the conclusion in @xcite that we should multiplex multiple flow sources to generate more appropriate simulated traffic flows .",
    "secondly , most of the previous physical models for the origins of self - similarities in network traffic can be adopted to account for the co - existence of multiple heterogeneous self - similar components .",
    "for example , in the on / off model @xcite , if it is further assumed that there exist two different values of the exponent parameters controlling the pareto distributions of the on - period / off - period of sources , then the aggregated flow will have two self - similar components with different hurst exponents and thus exhibits crossover phenomenon .",
    "in general , in most complicated data networks , a channel is shared by many data sources ( users ) in an approximately independent and additive way . due to the diversities of users and data transfer mechanisms , the inflow from different data sources might possess different hurst components .",
    "this leads to the following conjecture : _ it is more likely to observe the crossover phenomenon in the traffic flows on backbone networks . _",
    "thirdly , using either the cumulant or the wavelet based hurst coefficient estimation , we can estimate the approximate varying range of the hurst exponents .",
    "this work is very helpful , because a more appropriate and more accurate physical model often allows for a potential qualitative improvements on network performance @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
