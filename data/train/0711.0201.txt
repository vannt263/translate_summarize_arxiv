    "nonetheless , the condition that an endomorphism @xmath1385 lies in @xmath382 ( or @xmath602 ) is determined by a system of linear equations .",
    "this is the source of polynomial time algorithms for computing central decompositions of @xmath0-groups found in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the equations to determine if @xmath1386 or @xmath179 ( and hence to determine the automorphism group of a @xmath0-group ) are quadratic and generally difficult to solve .",
    "the use of bilinear maps makes many of the results adaptable to other algebraic objects .",
    "for instance , our theorems apply ( at least over finite fields ) to central decompositions of class @xmath2 nilpotent lie algebras .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the use of finite fields removed the need to consider hermitian forms over non - commutative division rings in the classification of @xmath8-simple algebras , and consequently also the related simple jordan algebras ( theorem [ thm:*-structure ] and theorem [ thm : herm - structure ] ) ; therefore , this assumption affects sections [ sec : simples ] and [ sec : orbits ] .",
    "furthermore , as finite fields are separable we are able to apply taft s @xmath8-algebra version of the wedderburn principal theorem ( theorem [ thm : taft ] ) in proving theorem [ thm : indecomps ] .",
    "evidently our proofs apply also to bilinear maps over algebraically closed fields of characteristic not 2 .",
    "the omission of @xmath2-groups of exponent @xmath1383 in the proof of theorem [ thm : main - reduction ] can be relaxed @xcite .",
    "the known obstacles for @xmath2-groups of class 2 and exponent @xmath1383 derive from the usual complications of symmetric bilinear forms in characteristic 2 .",
    "we are presently investigating whether or not these are indeed the only limitations .",
    "i am grateful to w. m. kantor for many helpful discussions and for suggesting the jordan product for @xmath602 ; to e. m. luks and c. r. b. wright for their comments on earlier drafts ; and to e. i. zelmanov and h. p. petersson for advice on jordan algebras ."
