    "xssj122704859 ( hereafter j12270 ) is one of the most mysterious x - ray objects among recent discoveries , which shows quite anomalous temporal characteristics both in the x - ray and optical regimes @xcite . a possible association with the fermi @xmath2-ray source 1fglj1227.94852 has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is conceivably a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) from its rapid flux variation and a power - law spectrum in the x - ray @xcite , but conventional views of lmxbs are insufficient to explain its unusual features such as a broad spectral energy distribution ( sed ) up to gev and anomalous x - ray variability .    to better understand the system , near - infrared ( nir ) observations are key .",
    "several spectral components are expected in the nir regime for lmxbs , which include the thermal emission from the secondary star and outer part of the accretion disk , and non - thermal cyclo - synchrotron emission by electrons accelerated in a jet or hot inner accretion flow .",
    "these components have a different dependence on wavelengths and time variability ( or lack thereof ) , thus comparison with nir and other wavelength observations @xcite will help decompose the broad sed . nevertheless , no results of targeted nir observations have been presented to date for this source besides all - sky surveys .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present the result of nir photometry and linear polarimetry observations using the infrared survey facility ( irsf ) 1.4  m telescope . during a part of our nir observations",
    ", we also conducted simultaneous x - ray observations using the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) .",
    "in addition , we retrieve the unpublished archived x - ray data by the swift satellite to complement the previous reports by @xcite and @xcite showing suzaku , xmm - newton , and rxte data , and examine if these anomalous x - ray characteristics are common in this object .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we briefly review the previous observational findings of this object . in  3 and  4",
    ", we describe the observations and analysis of the data separately for each observing facility . in  5 , we combine all the results and discuss the possible nature of the system .",
    "the main results are summarized in  6 .",
    "j12270 was initially discovered in the rxte slew survey @xcite and later identified as a hard x - ray emitter by integral ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "j12270 was once classified as an intermediate polar ( ip ) , a binary system of a moderately magnetized ( @xmath3  g ) white dwarf and a late - type companion based on optical spectroscopy @xcite and a hint of 860  s x - ray periodicity @xcite .",
    "the results of x - ray spectroscopy @xcite , however , argue against the ip nature of this source .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is featureless , not showing signature of fe emission lines , contrary to the defining ip characteristic of strong fe emission lines @xcite .",
    "anomalous x - ray temporal characteristics of j12270 were first discovered by @xcite using the suzaku x - ray satellite and later confirmed by @xcite using the xmm - newton satellite .",
    "the features include : ( 1 )  repetitive flux increase lasting for a short duration of a few hundred seconds ( flares ) , ( 2 )  sudden flux decrease with no apparent periodicity ( dips ) , ( 3 )  spectral hardening after some flux increase ( hardening ) , and ( 4 )  dichotomy in x - ray activity ; i.e. intervals filled with flares and those without .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that there are two types of dips ; i.e. , dips with hardening only seen immediately after flares and those without hardening seen during quiescent phases without apparent periodicity .",
    "unique temporal characteristics were also reported in the optical and in the ultraviolet ( uv ) regimes .",
    "@xcite found flux variation of a large amplitude ( @xmath4  mag ) , which is accompanied by flickering and a distinctive pattern of variation . in optical spectroscopy",
    ", they also reported that the equivalent width of the h@xmath5 emission line was twice as large as that reported by @xcite . using the broad - band capability of xmm - newton by combining the optical monitor ( om ) and",
    "the x - ray ccd detectors , @xcite accumulated many new results revealing intriguing features of this source : ( 1 )  optical / uv flares are seen , which are always accompanied by x - ray flares , ( 2 )  x - ray dips in the quiescent phase are not seen in the uv , and ( 3 )  a possible orbital period of 4.32  hour in @xmath6 band photometry .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of the fermi source , for which they claim j12270 to be the most likely counterpart .",
    "the 0.1300  gev light curve is stable with a 4-day time binning over 1 year .",
    "the 0.1300  gev luminosity is @xmath74.9@xmath810@xmath9  erg  s@xmath10 at an assumed distance of 1  kpc , which is comparable to that of x - ray luminosity in 0.212  kev band @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is represented by a power - law model with a photon index of 2.5 and shows a significant cut - off at 4.1  gev .",
    "based on these properties , @xcite claimed that the fermi source is a binary millisecond pulsar .",
    "@xcite also conducted radio imaging observations around the fermi source using the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) and the giant metrewave radio telescope and found a radio counterpart to j12270 .",
    "a significant detection was obtained at 5.5 and 9  ghz with a flux of 0.18 and 0.14  mjy , respectively .",
    "no millisecond pulsation was detected by follow - up observations using the parkes telescope .",
    "we had two runs of nir observations in 2009 january and march with a total of 13  nights ( table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "we used irsf 1.4  m telescope in the south african astronomical observatory .",
    "a part of the observations on march 13 and 15 was coordinated to be simultaneous with rxte (   [ s3 - 2 ] ) .",
    "the nir camera at the cassegrain focus of the telescope has two modes of operation : photometry with the simultaneous three - color infrared imager for unbiased survey ( sirius : @xcite ) and linear polarimetry with the sirius polarimetry mode ( sirpol : @xcite ) .",
    "sirius yields simultaneous @xmath11 ( 1.25  ) , @xmath12 ( 1.63  ) , and @xmath13 ( 2.14  ) band images using two dichroic mirrors .",
    "a very fast readout ( 5  s per frame ) enables us to follow rapid flux changes of j12270 reported in the optical and x - rays .",
    "sirius has @xmath14  pixels with a pixel scale of 045 pixel@xmath10 , making a @xmath15 field of view ( fov ) .",
    "sirpol is equipped with an achromatic ( 12.5  ) wave plate rotator unit over sirius and takes simultaneous @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath16 band images at four position angles ( , , , and ) for measurements of linear polarization .",
    "the stokes parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are obtained as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the intensity of an object at the position angle @xmath24 .",
    "the polarization degree @xmath25 and the polarization angle @xmath26 are then calculated as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "all sirius and sirpol observations were carried out with a 15  s exposure per frame with a 10-point dithering .",
    "the observing conditions were photometric with a typical seeing of 14 .",
    "dark frames were obtained at the end of each night , while twilight flat frames were obtained daily before and after the observation and averaged over a month .",
    "we reduced the data following the standard pipeline procedure using the imaging reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) software package .",
    "the procedure includes subtracting dark frames , flat - fielding , masking bad pixels , and eliminating fringe patterns by oh emission and the reset anomaly of the detector .",
    "ten dithered frames were then merged into one image .",
    "a small number of frames were discarded during the automated pipeline processing due to incompleteness of the data .",
    "we observed j12270 using rxte @xcite twice on 2009 march 13 and 15 as a target of opportunity program to conduct simultaneous x - ray and nir observations ( table  [ t1 ] ) . among three instruments",
    "onboard the satellite , we used the proportional counter array ( pca : @xcite ) , which consists of five proportional counter units ( pcus ) .",
    "the pca , which is a non - imaging detector with a @xmath29 fov , covers an energy range of 260  kev and has a total area of 6250  @xmath30 .",
    "we used the data obtained by the top layer of pcu  2 with a time resolution of 16  s. following the standard prescription , we discarded events when the separation between the object and the satellite pointing was larger than @xmath31 and the earth elevation angle was below 10@xmath32 .",
    "we further removed events during south atlantic anomaly passages and 30  min thereafter , those within 600  s before and 150  s after pca breakdowns , and those when the electron to x - ray event ratio was larger than 0.1 . as a result ,",
    "the total exposure time was 16  ks ( table [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the source events are subject to contamination by other objects due to the lack of imaging capability and a large fov of the instrument .",
    "we estimate the contamination to be @xmath710% by comparing the j12270 flux between rxte and suzaku @xcite .",
    "we used the heasoft version 6.6 for the reduction of the rxte data .",
    "the swift satellite @xcite observed j12270 twice on 2005 september 15 and 24 ( table  [ t1 ] ) . the x - ray telescope ( xrt : @xcite )",
    "is equipped with an x - ray ccd device for imaging - spectroscopy , which has a sensitivity in an energy range of 0.210  kev , an energy resolution of 140  ev at 5.9  kev , an effective area of 125  @xmath30 at 1.5  kev , and a fov of @xmath33 .",
    "we used the photon counting mode with a frame time of 2.5  s.    the data were retrieved from the archive and reduced with the standard pipeline process , yielding a total exposure time of @xmath77  ks ( table [ t1 ] ) .",

    "figure  [ f1 ] convincingly shows that all x - ray flares accompany nir flares .",

    ", we found that this phenomenon is unique to j12270 .",
    "it is either that the quiescent base level has changed or that the fourth quarter was observed during a decay phase of a long flare .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)f7.eps    in order to separate the variable and non - variable components in the nir , we plotted x - ray count rate versus nir flux in the flare segments separately for the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath16 bands in figure  [ f7 ] .",
    "we used a larger time bin of 300  s to accommodate a possible time lag between the x - ray and nir flares .",
    "the x - ray and nir fluxes are roughly proportional , yielding acceptable fits by a linear relation for the three bands .",
    "the slopes of the three linear relations are consistent with each other , which is consistent with the nir flares being colorless . assuming that the y - intercept of the linear relations is the residual non - variable component in the nir flux , it is estimated as 0.90 , 0.75 , and 0.55  mjy in @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath16 band , respectively .",
    "the contamination to the x - ray flux by other sources (   [ s3 - 2 ] ) changes this estimate by @xmath5410% .",
    "when we add the optical data taken from @xcite in figure  [ f7 ] , a different and nearly flat slope is found for the optical photometry against the x - ray count rate during the flare .",
    "this might indicate that there are two components in the nir and optical bands ; one is non - variable during flares and is more intense in the optical band , while the other is variable during flares with a proportional behavior to x - ray counts and is more intense in the nir band .",
    "a plausible origin of the non - variable component is the emission from the secondary star and a part of the accretion disk , if j12270 is indeed a lmxb .",

    "nir spectroscopic observations are required to decompose the possible secondary and disk emission and to derive on accurate spectral type of the secondary ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    because the distance is so poorly constrained with the currently available data set , we normalize physical values with a 1  kpc distance hereafter .",
    "the distance does not contradict the observed @xmath56 value and its galactic position .",

    "some lmxbs , particularly black hole binaries in a low luminosity state , are often accompanied by relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "synchrotron radiation is emitted over a wide spectral range .",
    "some evidence suggests that a break occurs between the optically - thin and optically - thick synchrotron emission around the nir band ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is also expected that the contrast of the synchrotron emission is relatively high against other spectral component in this band .",
    "therefore , many efforts have been made to detect linear nir polarization from many lmxbs @xcite , which would argue for synchrotron origin of the nir emission .",
    "however , only two sources ( scox-1 and groj165540 ; @xcite ) were detected with nir polarization intrinsic to the source .",
    "the polarization degree was a few percent at most , which is smaller than our upper limit for j12270 (   [ s4 - 1 - 2 ] ) .",
    "our observation was not sensitive enough to probe possible linear polarization , and the lack of detection should not discourage further investigation .",
    "we have looked into all the x - ray data available to date through @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and this work using the suzaku , xmm - newton , rxte , and swift satellites over a span of 3.5  years starting in 2007 november with a total integration of 133  ks .",
    "the anomalous temporal behavior is seen in all the data sets .",
    "the best - fit parameters in the x - ray spectral fitting during flares and those outside of flares are almost the same in all data . also , light curves in several x - ray bands are available from 2009 august up to the time of writing , from the monitor of all - sky x - ray imager onboard the international space station , which are stable with no apparent phase changes seen in other monitored lmxbs .",
    "all these suggest that the x - ray characteristics presented in previous and this work are the norm of this object .",
    "@xcite claim that the fermi source , for which j12270 is the most likely counterpart , is a millisecond pulsar , although the optical observation conducted in 2008 july @xcite clearly shows a signature of accretion . to reconcile this inconsistency",
    ", they speculated that the system changed from accretion - powered phase to rotation - powered phase before the fermi observation in 2008 august to 2010 september .",
    "however , we consider this to be unlikely because the x - ray results throughout this period show no significant changes in its spectral and temporal characteristics of the source .",
    "( 170mm,170mm)f8.eps    with a close inspection of x - ray flares , some features are seen commonly in all events : ( 1 )  a time profile of slow rise and rapid decay , ( 2 )  the constant contrast between the flare peak and the base level , ( 3 )  no spectral changes during flares , ( 4 )  undershoot in flux and spectral hardening after flares , which are most notably seen in the last flare in a series of repetitive flares , and ( 5 )  simultaneous optical and nir flares and their flare peaks before an x - ray flare peaks .",
    "a difference among these flares is the time scale of the profile . to test this idea , we used one of the xmm - newton flares @xcite as a template and fitted all the other x - ray flares by thawing the time scale .",
    "figure  [ f8 ]  ( a  d ) shows the result , in which we present the template flare profile ( a ) and three other flares ( b  d ) scaled with the best - fit time scaling factor .",
    "we found that the profiles are similar to each other , including the development in the spectral hardness and optical / nir flux .",
    "the repetitive nature of such x - ray flares is a distinctive character of j12270 .",
    "we compare the flare profile with other classes of galactic sources showing repetitive flares and having either a black hole or a neutron star in the system ( figure  [ f8 ] ) .",
    "we pick up representative sources from each class ; ( e )  grs1915@xmath65105 for microquasars ( @xcite ) , ( f )  4u172834 for type  i bursters ( @xcite ) , ( g )  mxb1730335 for type  ii bursters ( @xcite ) , and ( h )  sgra * ( @xcite ) .",
    "grs1915@xmath65105 is known to show a wide variety of flare phenomenology .",
    "we compared with the class @xmath66 variation in a phenomenological classification scheme by @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that j12270 is unlikely to be a type  i and type  ii burster .",
    "type  i bursters are characterized by rapid flux increase and slow exponential decay in their flare profile ( figure  [ f8]f ) and show clear x - ray spectral changes during flares .",
    "type  ii bursters show a correlation between the flare energy and the waiting time for the flare .",
    "both of these defining characteristics are not seen in j12270 , ruling out the possibility that j12270 is either type  i or type  ii bursters .",
    "we consider that the similarities between j12270 and grs1915@xmath65105 ( class @xmath66 variation in @xcite ) may be more relevant for unveiling the nature of this source .",
    "both show repetitive flares in similar shapes but with slightly varying time scales , simultaneous nir flares @xcite , no spectral changes during flares , flux undershoot and spectral hardening after flares , most noticeably in the last flare in a series , and dichotomy between time intervals filled with flares and those without .",
    "there are some differences ; e.g. , a precursor flare is seen before a series of repetitive flares in grs1915@xmath65105 , while no such feature is apparent in j12270 .",
    "also , grs1915@xmath65105 is known to have lots of other states @xcite , while j12270 is known to have only one so far .",
    "grs1915@xmath65105 is close to the eddington luminosity while j12270 is probably at very low luminosity . despite these differences ,",
    "it is interesting that many distinctive features of j12270 are also seen in grs1915@xmath65105 .",
    "one interesting source that may bridge between the two is igrj170913624 @xcite .",
    "this source also shows repetitive flares in a similar time scale and a similar amplitude .",
    "the variation is reminiscent of the @xmath66 class variation in grs1915@xmath65105 @xcite , but the luminosity is nowhere near the eddington limit .",
    "this may indicate that the anomalous flux variation seen in the three samples can occur at any luminosity .",
    "based on this , we speculate that the underlying physics to cause such x - ray variability is the same .",
    "the cause for the variability is not well understood for grs1915@xmath65105 , let alone j12270 . at least , we speculate two things : ( 1 )  the nir flare peaks 150300  s before x - ray peaks excludes the possibility of x - ray reprocessing to be the origin of the nir flares .",
    "( 2 )  the time scale of the flares in j12270 is much longer than the scales that are considered to be caused by jet ejection in other microquasars ( e.g. , gx3394 and xtej1118 + 480 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray and nir variability is not caused by jet ejection itself , but some sort of outside - in instability in the accretion disk or an extended corona .",
    "in fact , the flare peak delay between nir and x - ray (  [ s5 - 1 ] ) is comparable with the dynamical time scale of @xmath7150  s for a 5  @xmath60 black hole at a 10@xmath67 @xmath68 or @xmath7170  s for a 1.4  @xmath60 compact object at a 2.5@xmath69 @xmath68 , in which @xmath68 is the gravitational radii .",
    "it is vital to construct an sed to understand the nature of high - energy objects . to extend the sed shown in @xcite to longer wavelengths , we retrieved survey data at many wavelengths , which include the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ; @xcite ) at 843  mhz , the akari all - sky survey in far - infrared at 160 , 140 , 90 , and 65  @xmath70 m @xcite and in mid - infrared at 18 and 9  @xmath70 m @xcite , the 2mass all - sky survey catalogue @xcite in nir , the us naval observatory catalogue ( usno - b ; @xcite ) in the optical , the fourth ibis / isgri soft gamma - ray survey catalog @xcite , and the fermi large area telescope first source catalogue @xcite .",
    "we also added the recent atca radio detection at 5.5 and 9.0  ghz by @xcite .",
    "we made an sed for observed as well as extinction - corrected fluxes using bands with a significant detection ( figure  [ f9 ] top ) .",
    "we found only upper limits for the sumss and akari data , which are indicated by downward arrows .",
    "( 140mm,90mm)f9.eps    as a comparison , we present the sed of some microquasars : grs1915@xmath65105 , xtej1118@xmath65480 , and cygnusx-3 ( figure  [ f9 ] bottom ) . in the lower energy band , j12270 shares a common characteristic with the other microquasors , in which a nearly flat sed is seen down to @xmath71  ghz .",
    "this is interpreted as optically - thick synchrotron emission from relativistic jets @xcite .    in the upper energy band ,",
    "the @xmath2-ray spectrum of j12270 is apparently steeper and lower than its extrapolated x - ray spectrum .",
    "however , we can fit the x - ray to gev sed with a simple broken power - law model with a break at @xmath71  ghz ( figure  [ f9 ] ) .",
    "the break at @xmath710@xmath72  ghz for microquasars is expected and interpreted as the consequence of the synchrotron cooling in the optically - thin regime of the emission .",
    "the break frequency @xmath73 is determined from the balance between the radiative cooling and acceleration of electrons .",
    "if fermi acceleration in shock waves is responsible for the acceleration , @xmath74},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the shock velocity and @xmath76 is the dimensionless parameter to represent the turbulence in the magnetic field in the shock ; i.e. , mean free path of an electron in units of the larmor radius @xcite .    due to the break , microquasars are just below the sensitivity of the fermi survey @xcite .",
    "however , with a slight change in the parameters , a fermi detection is not a surprise for microquasars .",
    "indeed , the first such detection was reported from cygnus x-3 recently by @xcite .",
    "j12270 shows a break at a frequency higher by a decade , which may indicate that it has a slightly more efficient acceleration in comparison to others , if it is a microquasar .    on the other hand ,",
    "no akari detection and the atca detection below back - extrapolating the x - ray power - law ( figure  [ f9 ] ) suggest that there is a second break to the broadband power - law emission .",
    "in fact , a break in ir band attributed to the jet is observed in a microquasar gx3394 ( @xcite ) .",
    "those two breaks at high energy and ir bands are reported in a black hole candidate xtej1118@xmath65480 in the low / hard state ( @xcite ) , whose emission is considered to be mainly came from synchrotron jet .",
    "we conducted nir and x - ray observations of the enigmatic source xssj122704859 . during the coordinated nir and x - ray observations using irsf sirius and rxte pca , we detected simultaneous and repetitive nir and x - ray flares for the first time .",
    "nir polarization was not detected .",
    "based on the observed data together with those presented in previous work @xcite , we compared the flare profiles and the sed with other classes of x - ray sources and argued that j12270 shows similarities with a type of variation seen in the microquasar grs1915@xmath65105 in many of its defining characteristics . based on this and the broad sed commonly seen in microquasars , we argued that the nature of j12270 is a microquasar . at an assumed distance of 1  kpc",
    ", it has a very low luminosity of @xmath010@xmath1 of the eddington luminosity for a stellar mass black hole or neutron star .",
    "if j12270 is confirmed to be a lmxb with a fermi counterpart , it will be the first example of a @xmath2-ray binary having a low - mass companion .",
    "we thank daisuke kato for his help in obtaining nir data for a sirius run , hirofumi hatano for advice in polarimetry data reduction , shinki oyabu for advice on akari survey data , and hajime inoue and mamoru doi for useful discussion .",
