    "the interpretation of the atmospheric muon neutrino deficit in the superkamiokande is that muon neutrinos oscillate to tau neutrinos with nearly maximal mixing @xcite .",
    "experiments such as icanoe , opera and monolith will be able to test the oscillation hypothesis by searching for tau neutrino conversion to taus @xcite after the accelerator beam of muon neutrinos has passed over the long - baseline between cern and the gran sasso laboratory .",
    "the minos experiment run at lower energies @xcite will look for the characteristic muon neutrino deficit . ultimately , one would like to know the neutrino - nucleon charged current cross section to the level of a few percent for precision measurements of oscillation mixing angles .",
    "mass corrections , from both the out - going charged lepton and from the target nucleon , are important at this level . here , we report on lepton and target mass corrections in the collinear limit to neutrino - nucleon charged current interactions in deep inelastic scattering .",

    ", deep inelastic scattering is the dominant interaction channel .",
    "nlo qcd , charm mass ( @xmath6 ) and target mass corrections are potentially important ingredients in the interpretation of the experimental result .    in the next section ,",
    "we review the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) formalism , concentrating on charged current scattering ( cc ) where two additional structure functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 come into play for energies not too large compared to the outgoing lepton mass .",
    "we show our results for the structure functions with nlo qcd corrections , and @xmath6 and nucleon mass @xmath9 corrections in the collinear limit , in section 3 .",
    "our cross section results for @xmath1 cc scattering with isoscalar nucleons @xmath10 and @xmath11 cc scattering are shown in section 4 .",

    "the qcd dynamical part of the evaluation of neutrino interactions is given through the hadronic tensor @xmath12    sandwiched between the current operators in the first line of eq .",
    "[ eq : wmunu0 ] , an inclusive sum over a complete set of states has been performed : @xmath13 in which @xmath14    our focus here is on the dis contribution , however , there is an issue of double counting if one does the inclusive sum and adds to separate exclusive processes important in the few gev energy region .",
    "one way to approximately avoid double counting @xcite is to impose a cut on the hadronic energy @xmath15 for @xmath16-boson momentum @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , in ref .",
    "@xcite we evaluate the contributions from a range of @xmath18 to assess the importance of non - perturbative or higher - twist contributions to the cross section .",

    "the structure function @xmath21 which multiplies the antisymmetric tensor with @xmath22 and @xmath17 never appears because the tensor combination contracts to zero with the leptonic equivalent of @xmath23 in the cross section .",

    "[ eq : nusig ] , the extra structure functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 appear with powers of the charged lepton mass , and so are usually neglected . at leading order ,",
    "they are related to the usual structure functions by the albright - jarlskog relations @xcite , generalizations of the callan - gross relations : @xmath32 these relations are violated by kinematic target mass corrections and at nlo in qcd when quark masses are retained .",
    "more specifically , eq .  [ eq : aj1 ] is violated by @xmath33 and @xmath34 corrections , but not by the charm mass @xmath6 when the strange quark mass vanishes .",
    "[ eq : aj2 ] is violated by non - zero @xmath9 and @xmath6 , but for the massless case , this albright - jarlskog relation holds to any order in @xmath35 .",
    "the complete lepton mass correction comes from the above equation together with the limits of integration to get the full cross section .",
    "details of the lepton mass dependence of the integration limits appear in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "target mass corrections appear in eq .",
    "[ eq : nusig ] , and they also appear implicitly in the @xmath20 s . for neutrino scattering , it is conventional to rewrite @xmath20 in terms of @xmath36 which are written at leading order , neglecting the target and charm quark masses , as @xmath37 in terms of quark distribution functions @xmath38 .",
    "target mass corrections appear in the collinear ( @xmath39 ) limit due to the fact that the _ small _ nucleon light cone momentum @xmath40 is not a simple rescaling of the massless parton momentum @xmath41 when we have @xmath42 for the _ large _ components .",
    "when one includes @xmath9 in the collinear limit and @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is replaced by the parameter @xmath43 , one gets for the case of cc charm production : @xmath44 here , @xmath45 a further target mass correction come in through the nachtmann variable @xcite @xmath46 for massless quark production and @xmath47 for charm production . for the result shown below @xmath48 expressions for the @xmath49 corrections appear in detail in ref .",
    "the light quark contributions are obviously understood to be included in the @xmath50 limit .",
    "in figs .  [ fig : f4 ] , [ fig : f5 ] we quantify the violations of the albright - jarlskog relations discussed above .",
    "the violations are concentrated at low-@xmath51 which is not the most relevant kinematic region for present neutrino energies .",
    "the naive albright - jarlskog relations therefore provide reasonable approximations in the evaluation of integrated cross sections .    the target mass corrections shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : f4],[fig : f5 ] are in the collinear limit .",
    "these corrections differ by at most 10% from the target mass corrected structure functions evaluated in the operator product expansion approach @xcite in the range of @xmath52 gev@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the differences are smaller than 10% where the structure functions are largest .",
    "the integrated cross sections for tau and muon ( anti-)neutrino dis are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "the uncertainty in the cross sections from varying the parton distribution functions within their bounds is typically about a few percent : the results in the figures are based on cteq6 @xcite .",
    "we have also compared to grv98 @xcite .      in terms of a purely dis evaluation of the neutrino cross - section ,",
    "@xmath2 production is a natural observable because the tau mass cuts off non - dis interaction to a good extent .",
    "the general nlo features of our results for @xmath55 dis are , therefore , equally valid for @xmath56 dis with kinematic dis cuts . in figs .",
    "[ fig : mu ] and [ fig : kfac2 ] we show two typical features of the inclusion of nlo effects : scale dependence and the size of the k - factor .",
    "the scale dependence is substantially reduced compared to a lo calculation and the k factor hints at the importance of nlo corrections towards low neutrino energies .",
    "different from @xmath2 production , the deep inelastic component    becomes small in @xmath56 scattering at lower energies as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuint1 ] . since the tau threshold in @xmath55 dis extends to large energies one may wonder about the impact of muon mass terms in low energy @xmath56 scattering .",
    "[ fig : nuint2 ] looks at such corrections to the dis component .",
    "the results strongly depend on the kinematic cuts imposed .",
    "this observation , taken together with the smallness of the _ bona fide _ deep inelastic component at such energies do not allow to draw a conclusion from the perturbative framework which we consider here . rather , one will have to look into the equivalent corrections to elastic and low - multiplicity form factors .",
    "the @xmath58 cross section is an important ingredient in current and future atmospheric and neutrino factory experiments .",
    "our evaluation @xcite of the nlo corrections for @xmath1n cc interactions including charm mass corrections and an estimate of target mass effects is part of a larger theoretical program to understand the inelastic @xmath58 cross section over the full energy range relevant to experiments .",
    "apart from oscillation searches , the recent observation of an anomaly in the ratios of neutral to charged current neutrino ineractions also necessitate a solid theory for neutrino interactions with nuclei .",
