    "it was not until 2008 when a group of researchers at the hewllet - packard lab has announced : _",
    "the missing element has been found _ @xcite . after the announcement a rather large number of results dealing with memristors",
    "have been reported in the literature ( cf .",
    "[ 4 - 10 ] and references therein ) .",
    "memristors , and also memcapacitors and meminductors ( commonly referred to as mem - elements ) [ 6,11 ] , are intriguing circuit elements not only from the point of view of circuit design , but also , because of their unusual dynamical properties and characteristics . for that reason",
    "mem - elements attract interests of dynamical systems analysts , mathematicians ( including numerical researchers ) and computer engineers .",
    "last , but not least , mechanical memristors are becoming important elements in mechanical and electro - mechanical devices [ 12,13 ] and memristive fingerprints occur in electro - mechanical cassie - mayr welding arcs models [ 14,15 ] .",
    "this paper further expands the notion of equivalence between electrical and mechanical elements and devices , as it provides explicit formulae for the _ force _ quantity @xmath12 in @xmath13 , the second newton s law , for memristive chua s circuits and other similar circuits with mixed - mode oscillations .    in general",
    ", there are six mem - elements , classified according to the input - output relationship and the nature of the _ internal _ variable .",
    "all six mem - elements can be described as follows .",
    "consider the @xmath14-controlled mem - element described by the following equations @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath14 are the mem - element s output and input variables , respectively , @xmath17 is the internal state variable and the prime @xmath18 .",
    "for the six possible mem - elements of interest , the variables @xmath16 , @xmath14 and @xmath17 have the meanings shown in table [ tab1 ] , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath1 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the voltage , current , charge , flux , time - integral of charge and time - integral of flux , respectively .",
    "the four letter abbreviations in the first column of table [ tab1 ] indicate the input variable and the type of mem - element .",
    "for example , the ccmr stands for a current controlled memristor . since the input ( controlling ) variable @xmath14 is the current ( @xmath21 ) ,",
    "therefore the internal variable @xmath17 is the charge , since @xmath22 ( see ( [ eq1 ] ) ) . the remaining output variable @xmath16 of ccmr is the voltage @xmath9 , thus @xmath23 .",
    "the other five mem - elements are also described by ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xmath26 and @xmath27 denoting memcapacitors and meminductors , respectively .",
    "the @xmath28 denotes the controlling ( input ) variable .",
    "thus , depending on a mem - element , the @xmath28 is one of the variables from the set @xmath29 , either the charge , voltage , flux or current , respectively .",
    "table [ tab1 ] includes the @xmath30 function for each mem - element and the function @xmath31 , @xmath32 , for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
