    "the problem of scattering off a rough surface is a central topic in physics which occurs for many different types of waves and on considerably different length scales @xcite .",
    "phenomena induced by surface corrugations play a major role in the study of acoustic , electromagnetic and matter waves alike and appear in macroscopic domains such as acoustic oceanography and atmospheric sciences @xcite , but also emerge on much smaller length scales , e.g. , for photonic crystals @xcite , optical fibers and waveguides @xcite , surface plasmon polaritons @xcite , metamaterials @xcite , thin metallic films @xcite , layered structures @xcite , graphene nanoribbons @xcite , nanowires @xcite and confined quantum systems @xcite . while having a detrimental effect on the performance of many of the above systems , surface roughness can also be put to use , e.g. , for the fabrication of high - performance thermoelectric devices @xcite and for light trapping in silicon solar cells @xcite ; rough surfaces also cause anomalously large persistent currents in metallic rings @xcite and provide the necessary scattering potential to manipulate ultra - cold neutrons which are bound by the earth s gravitiy potential @xcite .     attached to semi - infinite collinear leads of width @xmath0 .",

    "an example of an antisymmetric geometry is shown in which the upper and the lower surface disorder are identical .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in view of this sizeable research effort it might come as a surprise that even quite fundamental effects emerging in surface disordered systems are still not fully understood . consider here , in particular , the problem of wave transmission through a surface - corrugated guiding system which we will study in the following .",
    "as demonstrated in detail below , even a very elementary and well - studied model system , consisting of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) waveguide with a step - like surface disorder on either boundary ( see figure [ fig : figure1 ] ) , can only be inadequately described with conventional techniques .",
    "the reason why the knowledge on surface - disordered waveguides is still far behind the state - of - the - art for bulk - disordered systems is mainly due to the difficulties arising from the non - homogeneous character of transport via different propagating modes ( channels ) .",
    "as was numerically shown in @xcite , the transmission through multi - mode waveguides depends on many characteristic length scales which are specific for each mode . as a result",
    ", one can observe a coexistence of ballistic , diffusive , and localized regimes in the _ same _ waveguide when exploring mode - dependent transport coefficients .",
    "such effects lead to non - homogeneous scattering matrices which prevents the application of well developed analytical tools such as random matrix theory @xcite or the ballistic sigma model @xcite . additionally , the prospect of _ engineering _ the transmission through a waveguide by imprinting a specific surface profile @xcite requires a theory which is not based on some general assumptions on randomness in the surface disorder , but one which relates an arbitrary but _ given _ surface profile to the transmission of each transporting channel .",
    "an analytical surface scattering theory developed in @xcite is a promising candidate to fulfil this task . according to this theory",
    "the transmission through waveguides with a weak surface corrugation is determined by _ two _ principally different correlators embedded in the surface profile , where the @xmath3-correlator typically gives the main contribution to scattering which also appears in conventional approaches .",
    "this standard binary correlator measures the correlations between the profile _ amplitudes _ at the points @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6-correlator , on the other hand , is due to the correlations between the _ squares of the slopes _ ( squares of the derivatives ) of the profiles at the points @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in most theoretical studies ,",
    "this @xmath6-correlator is , however , neglected since it constitutes a higher - order term in the weak disorder expansion where the disorder amplitude is the relevant expansion parameter . in our article",
    "we will provide conclusive evidence that this term , although being of higher - order , can dominate the transmission through a surface - disordered waveguide and that it needs to be taken into account in a comprehensive description .",
    "first numerical and experimental indications that the @xmath6-correlator plays , indeed , an important role have been put forward in a recent study on a specific waveguide geometry which was designed such as to highlight the presence of this new term @xcite .",
    "here we go an important step further by demonstrating that the influence of this correlator shows up not just for carefully chosen waveguide geometries , but in a quite general class of waveguides .",
    "in particular , we will show that waveguides with a step - like surface disorder which have been well - studied by the community yield unambiguous and very pronounced signatures for the influence of the @xmath6-correlator which , to the best of our knowledge , have so far been overlooked . in these waveguides ( see figure [ fig : figure1 ] ) , the surface disorder features steps of random height ( in the direction transverse to propagation ) and of constant width ( in longitudinal direction ) .",
    "such waveguides have been considered in quite a few recent studies @xcite , as they are attractive model systems both for an experimental implementation as well as for a numerical computation .",
    "this is because waveguides with the above specifics can be easily built up by combining a series of rectangular waveguide stubs , each of which has no surface disorder but a randomly chosen height .",
    "our analysis will show that in these concatenated systems the @xmath6-correlator gives rise to well - defined resonances in the reflection coefficients which are perfectly reproduced in a corresponding numerical study . at these resonant values",
    "the @xmath6-correlator may strongly dominate over the lower - order @xmath3-correlator such that a conventional description breaks down . to show this not just by numerical evidence , but also by the corresponding analytical expressions",
    ", we significantly expand the existing theoretical framework presented in @xcite .",
    "this is mainly because the surface derivatives which enter the @xmath6-correlator diverge at the steps in the surface profile and thus require a special treatment .",
    "another important extension of the theory which we take into account is due to multiple scattering events between the propagating modes in the waveguide which yield a significant contribution beyond the single - scattering terms that have been considered so far . in this sense",
    ", our combined analytical - numerical study not only reveals a new effect , but also contributes to an extension of the underlying theory to the point where the analytical formulas which we derive provide predictions which quantitatively match with the numerical calculations that we perform independently .",
    "we consider a simple , however , non - trivial model consisting of a quasi-1d corrugated waveguide ( or conducting wire ) with discrete steps in the surface profile .",
    "this rough waveguide of length @xmath7 and average width @xmath8 is attached to infinite leads of width @xmath0 on the left and right ( see figure [ fig : figure1 ] ) .",
    "flux is injected from the left and propagates through @xmath9 open channels .",
    "the upper and lower surfaces of the rough waveguide are given by the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the random functions @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) describe the roughness of the surfaces and are assumed to be statistically homogeneous and isotropic , featuring zero mean , @xmath14 , and equal variances , @xmath15 . altogether",
    "three different cases will be considered in terms of the symmetries of the boundary profiles with respect to the horizontal center axis at @xmath16 :    1 .   _",
    "symmetric _ boundaries , @xmath17 2 .",
    "_ antisymmetric _ boundaries , @xmath18 3 .",
    "_ nonsymmetric _ boundaries , @xmath19    following the assumptions adopted in a few recent papers @xcite , the functions @xmath20 are chosen as sequences of horizontal steps of constant width @xmath1 and random heights , uniformly distributed in an interval @xmath21 $ ] around the upper ( lower ) boundary of the attached leads . in our numerical analysis we set @xmath22 and @xmath23 , resulting in a variance of the disorder , @xmath24 , which is small compared to the width of the waveguide , @xmath25",
    ".    note that we have realized , in the above way , a scattering system which is truly random yet features very strong spatial correlations in its surface disorder since the waveguide exhibits a potential step at each integer multiple of the step - width @xmath1 .",
    "according to the theory developed in @xcite , the correlations in the surface disorder enter the scattering properties of the system through two independent correlators .",
    "the first one is the binary correlator of the surface profile , @xmath26 which contains contributions only from the _ amplitude _ @xmath27 and the _ derivative _ of the surface profile @xmath28 .",
    "correspondingly , the scattering mechanism that this correlator gives rise to is referred to as the _ amplitude - gradient - scattering ( ags ) mechanism_.    the other correlator contains scattering contributions which are independent of those in equation and which are related to the square of the profile s derivative , @xmath29 , in an effective potential description ( see details in @xcite ) , @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding scattering process is thus referred to as the _ square - gradient - scattering ( sgs ) mechanism_. we emphasize here that the validity of the identity @xmath32 used in different contexts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is restricted to gaussian random processes and can not be applied for the present step - like surface profiles .",
    "indeed , as we will see below , this simplification would lead to a severe underestimation of the sgs mechanism in the present context .    in our further analysis",
    "it will not be binary correlators themselves which will be the key quantities , but rather their fourier transforms @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 which denote the _ roughness - height _ power spectrum and the _ roughness - square - gradient _ power spectrum , respectively . here",
    "@xmath36 is the longitudinal wavenumber which is determined by the transverse quantization condition @xmath37 .",
    "the index @xmath38 stands for a specific open propagation channel with @xmath39 , where the total number of open modes is given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 denotes the scattering wavenumber .    for the scattering system in figure [ fig : figure1 ]",
    "the @xmath3-correlator can be obtained analytically , @xmath42 which is strongly peaked for surface points @xmath4 and @xmath5 which are closer to each other than the step width in the disorder , @xmath43 , but zero for all larger distances , @xmath44 .    for completeness and",
    "since it is a key parameter in @xcite , we want to stress the fact that , if defining the correlation length @xmath45 as the variance of the binary correlator @xmath46 , the step width @xmath1 and correlation length @xmath45 are directly linked with each other , @xmath47 . for the sake of simplicity we will use the step width @xmath1 in all expressions in the following since it represents the quantity which we tune in our simulations and which is therefore the more natural parameter in our system .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath46 then yields the analytical expression for the _ roughness - height _ power spectrum @xmath48 , @xmath49 an important point to mention here is the following : equations and implicitly assume that the rectangular steps in the profile boundary can be perfectly resolved by the scattering wave .",
    "however , due to the finite wavelength at which the scattering process takes place , also the resolution of the surface profile will always be finite . to accommodate this limited resolution",
    ", we introduce an effective smearing of the step profiles based on a fermi - function @xmath50 $ ] ( see the appendix for more details ) .",
    "the smoothness of this function is governed by the parameter @xmath51 which leads to a smearing of a step profile over a region @xmath52 ( see figure [ fig : smearing ] in the appendix for a corresponding illustration ) .",
    "if we now estimate that a scattering wave with a wavelength @xmath53 is associated with a resolution of @xmath54 , we obtain for the smearing parameter @xmath55 . employing this value for all further calculations ,",
    "a comparison with the numerical data suggests that this simple estimate already captures our simulations remarkably well . only in symmetric",
    "waveguides a reduced value of @xmath56 yields better agreement .",
    "when incorporating the smoothness of the steps into the roughness - height power spectrum , we can again obtain a simple analytical expression which takes the following form ( see the appendix for details ) , @xmath57 for small values of @xmath51 a taylor series expansion is justified , @xmath58 , yielding the result already obtained for infinitely sharp steps , equation .",
    "the above approach involving a smearing of the step - disorder turns out to be essential when considering the _ roughness - square - gradient _ power spectrum @xmath59 .",
    "this is because , without the smearing , the corresponding expressions would diverge , as can easily be understood from the fact that the @xmath60 turns into a delta function at the position of a step when an infinite resolution is assumed .",
    "this divergence is , however , conveniently tamed through the above procedure involving the fermi - function , yielding the following analytical expression for @xmath59 ( see appendix ) , @xmath61 } { \\sin^2(k_x\\delta/2 ) }       \\bigg ] \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : sk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition to the smearing parameter @xmath51 , the above expression contains also the integer number @xmath62 which determines the number of steps @xmath63 that are _ effectively _ involved in the scattering process .",
    "the notion of an effective number has been introduced here to take into account that the total number of steps in the waveguide , @xmath64 , is typically significantly larger than the value @xmath63 which we find to reproduce our data .",
    "this difference , @xmath65 , can be attributed to the finite penetration depth of the propagating wave as a result of which the effective longitudinal dimension of the waveguide is greatly reduced .",
    "we shall thus determine the quantity @xmath62 through a direct comparison with the numerical data to be presented below .",
    "note also that we have used ensemble averaging for the derivation of the above formulas and ( to ensure convergence of equation in the appendix ) @xcite .",
    "recent work demonstrates , however , that an application of the predictions following from the two different correlators above yields good quantitative agreement also for individual disorder realizations as in single disordered waveguides @xcite .",

    ", the perturbation induced by the surface disorder has to be weak , resulting in the following independent requirements , @xmath71 here , @xmath72 is the _ partial attenuation length _ of the @xmath38th incoming mode ( from the left ) which takes into account both the scattering in _ forward direction _",

    "explicitly , we performed extensive numerical simulations on transport through surface - disordered waveguides of all three symmetry classes .",
    "for these numerical simulations we employ the efficient `` modular recursive green s function method '' ( mrgm ) @xcite to solve the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian ( in atomic units ) , @xmath100 on a discretized grid .",
    "the potential term @xmath101 defines the surface potential which is infinite outside the waveguide and flat ( @xmath102 ) inside , corresponding to hard - wall boundary conditions .",
    "since the scattering problem is equivalent to the helmholtz equation , our approach is not only suitable for electronic systems but can , e.g. , also be applied to microwave systems as in @xcite , or quite generally to systems which satisfy a helmholtz - like equation .",
    "the mrgm is particularly advantageous for the present setup since the vertical steps in the disorder profile allow us to assemble the waveguide by connecting a large number of rectangular elements , which will be referred to as `` modules '' .",
    "these modules are chosen to have equal width @xmath1 , but different heights .",
    "the computation is based on a finite - difference approximation of the laplacian and proceeds such that we first calculate the green s functions for a number of modules with different heights .",
    "these green s functions are then connected to each other by way of a matrix dyson equation @xcite .",
    "it is the different heights of the modules and additionally introduced random vertical shifts between them that give rise to the desired random sequence of vertical steps in the surface profile . to satisfy the additional symmetry imposed on the waveguide we arrange the modules such as to respect this specific symmetry .",
    "the key element of our numerical approach is an `` exponentiation '' algorithm @xcite which allows us to simulate transport through extremely long waveguides at moderate numerical costs . rather than connecting individual modules with each other",
    "until the length of the waveguide is reached , we first connect several sequences of randomly assembled modules .",
    "in a subsequent step these `` supermodules '' are then randomly permuted and connected to each other to form a next generation of supermodules .",
    "continuing this iterative procedure allows us to obtain the green s functions of waveguides with a length that increases exponentially with the number of generations . for waveguides of moderate lengths we tested this supermodule technique against the conventional approach where",
    "the modules are assembled one after the other .",
    "we found that the disorder - averaged green s functions obtained in these two ways do not show any noticeable difference from each other @xcite .    to calculate the desired transmission @xmath103 and reflection amplitudes @xmath104 for incoming flux from the left lead , we project the green s function at the scattering wavenumber @xmath41 onto the flux - carrying lead modes @xmath105 in the left and right lead , respectively . from these amplitudes",
    "we obtain the transmission from one mode to the other , @xmath106 , as well as the total transmission through one mode , @xmath107 , and the total transmission of the whole system , @xmath108 .",
    "in order to compare the analytical predictions of equations and for the attenuation lengths with our numerical results for the waveguide transmission , we extract the values of the mode attenuation lengths from the numerical data through an automatized fitting procedure . to obtain accurate fits of the length dependence of the transmission",
    "we evaluate the transmission at up to 250 ( symmetric waveguide ) , 200 ( antisymmetric waveguide ) and 80 ( nonsymmetric waveguide ) different length values in waveguides which reach a maximal length @xmath109 , with @xmath110 ( symmetric waveguide ) , @xmath111 ( antisymmetric waveguide ) and @xmath112 ( nonsymmetric waveguide ) , respectively . to suppress effects which are due to individual disorder realizations we additionally average the transmission over 100 ( symmetric and antisymmetric waveguides ) and 50 ( nonsymmetric waveguide ) different disorder realizations .",
    "our fits are then performed with the disorder - averaged transmission curves ( details are provided below ) . to keep the system at a manageable degree of complexity and to perform a direct comparison with equations and , we restrict ourselves to the regime of two open waveguide modes , @xmath113 , by choosing the wavenumber @xmath41 to be fixed at the value @xmath114 . by varying the step width @xmath1 in the surface disorder incrementally , we numerically scan through the module width dependence of the transmission ( at each value of @xmath1 an ensemble average over 50 - 100 waveguide realizations is performed )",
    ".    we will now discuss the disordered waveguides with different symmetry separately , as both the predictions from equations and as well as the procedure to extract the attenuation lengths are specific for each symmetry .      in symmetric",
    "waveguides the up - down symmetry of the entire scattering structure , @xmath115 , results in the fact that modes of different symmetry can not scatter into each other .",
    "for the two - mode waveguide considered here this means that the two modes @xmath116 scatter fully independently of each other with only _ intra - mode _ scattering ( with @xmath117 ) being relevant and _ inter - mode _ scattering ( with @xmath118 ) being entirely absent .",
    "correspondingly , the only scattering mechanism that attenuates an incoming wave in mode @xmath38 is back - scattering into the same mode ( forward - scattering in the same mode does not attenuate the mode and inter - mode scattering is forbidden ) . for our analysis",

    "our aim in the following will be to include such higher - order contributions based on the knowledge of the first - order scattering lengths .",
    "consider here , e.g. , the scattering length of the first mode , @xmath187 , which , as we have assumed so far , is attenuated by back - scattering from the first mode into the first ( @xmath188 ) and into the second mode ( @xmath189 ) , respectively .",

    "such terms can thus yield a sizeable contribution although they formally are of higher - order in the number of scattering events which they undergo .",

    "consequently , the modes can be assumed to be almost equally distributed between mode @xmath195 or @xmath196 before back - scattering occurs . as a result",
    ", the back - scattering contribution should also be composed of both modes in equal shares .",
    "since the forward - scattering occurs in series , the back - scattering in parallel , this translates into an additional _ effective _ second order term for the inverse scattering length , @xmath197 with @xmath198 .",
    "equation represents a simple qualitative estimate of second order contributions to the inverse scattering lengths , and we expect that this expression can be made more quantitative by employing a full - fledged diagrammatic theory . note that this correction term does not feature an explicit mode dependence since the redistribution of the flux is the same for both propagating modes .",
    "based on the above , the total inverse scattering lengths can be written as the sum of the following contributions , @xmath199 where the superscripts @xmath200 denote the order of the contribution . a comparison of this result with the numerical data",
