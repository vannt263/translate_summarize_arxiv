    "polymer networks are unique soft solids which can be significantly deformed without irreversible damage to their structure . a network is formed by cross - linking a melt or a semidilute solution of polymer chains .",
    "once a homogeneous ( on length scales large compared to its `` mesh '' size ) network is formed , one can generate large - scale patterns in it by further cross - linking , followed by swelling ( and possibly stretching ) of the network , resulting in a gel inhomogeously swollen by solvent .",
    "this can be done , for example , by adding light - sensitive cross - links to a transparent network . focusing a laser beam in regions inside the gel one can write  information into gel structure in the form of @xmath1 or @xmath2 patterns of cross - linking density . in this paper",
    "we show that although such information is hidden at preparation conditions , it can be recovered by swelling the gel since unobservable variations of cross - link density in the melt are transformed into observable variations of monomer density in the swollen gel .",
    "regions of a gel with increased cross - link concentration can be considered as inclusions with enhanced elastic modulus .",
    "if such inclusions deform differently from polymer matrix , as in case of any normal elastic solids , they would induce elastic stresses in the gel and initial pattern would be significantly distorted due to long range character of elastic interactions .",
    "this scenario determines , for example , the elastic properties of amorphous polycrystalline solids but it does not apply to polymer gels , because of the unusual character of gel elasticity .",
    "we show that in swollen gels that are isotropically stretched by absorption of solvent , the observed _ monomer density pattern _ is not distorted and is simply an affinely stretched variant of the _ initial cross - linking pattern_. such gels can serve as a magnifying glass that enlarges the initially written pattern without distorting its shape .",
    "the corresponding magnification factor can be very large in case of super - elasic networks .",

    "we assume that the gel was initially cross - linked in a polymer melt and then a pre - programmed pattern in cross - link concentration ( i.e. , a well - defined region of higher cross - link density compared to that of the surrounding network ) is created in the network using , say , a light - sensitive cross - linking technique ( the case of cross - linking in semi - dilute solution in good solvent is analyzed in si ) . here",
    "@xmath6 is the polymer contribution to the elastic modulus of the cross - linked melt ( which is proportional to the local cross - link density)@xmath7 and @xmath8 represents the variations of cross - link density introduced by the second cross - linking step ( fig .",

    "pattern3d    @xmath9 is the osmotic ( interaction ) part of the free energy of the gel , with monomer density @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the deformation gradient tensor@xmath12 and @xmath13 are coordinates of deformed gel .",
    "it is convenient to assume that the gel is deformed with respect to preparation state in two stages:@xmath14 thus , the gel is first stretched with respect to preparation state by factors @xmath15 along axes @xmath16 .",
    "for such a deformation @xmath17 with components @xmath18 and we get @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the uniform monomer density in the undeformed state of preparation ( fig .",

    "notice that the coordinates @xmath13 describe a stretched network with inhomogeneous cross - link density but a _ homogeneous monomer density _",
    "[ pattern]c and d ) .",
    "even though such a homogeneous ( in monomer density ) state does not minimize the free energy and therefore is not an equilibrium state of the deformed gel , we use it as a reference state .",
    "the true equilibrium state of the deformed network has an inhomogeneous monomer density profile and is defined by introducing a displacement field @xmath21 defined with respect to the above reference state : @xmath22 and we get gradient tensor and monomer density as function of coordinates @xmath13@xmath23    minimizing the free energy in eq .",
    "( [ ai ] ) with respect to displacements @xmath24 at the preparation state ( all @xmath25 ) we conclude that in a melt the cross - links and the monomers will remain at their previous possitions and the elastic reference state will not change after relaxation .",
    "we conclude that information about the pattern written on network structure is hidden in preparation state and can only be revealed after swelling .",
    "in a swollen state the monomer density is small and the interaction energy can be expanded as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is boltzmann constant , @xmath28 is temperature and @xmath29 is second virial coefficient . expanding the free energy in powers of @xmath24 and integrating over the volume of the undeformed network with measure @xmath30 we get@xmath31   \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{\\prod_{i}\\lambda _ { i}},\\quad k_{\\text{os}}=k_{b}tb\\bar{\\rho}^{2}. \\label{a}\\ ] ]    the equilibrium deformation of the gel is found by minimizing this free energy .",

    "[ pattern]a and e ) .",
    "equilibrium displacement is expressed through the variation of monomer density , eq .",
    "( [ dr ] ) , as@xmath42 we conclude that although density variations in isotropically deformed gels are strictly local , there is long - range strain field decaying as power law of the distance @xmath43 .",
    "this strain induces a stress distribution in the gel , which can be observed by measuring the birefringence of transmitted light ( stress - optical law @xcite ) .    in",
    "anisotropically deformed networks the pattern is strongly distorted ( compare figs .",
    "[ pattern]a and f ) and @xmath44 decays as power law of a distance @xmath45 from the localized cross - link density inhomogeneity @xmath46 . observe that variations of monomer density are largest along the direction of stretching .",
    "this effect is closely related to the well known butterfly  picture in contour plots of neutron scattering from random inhomogeneities of network structure in anisotropely deformed swollen gels @xcite .",
    "in order to understand the difference between gels and normal solids we recall that the free energy of any solid is a functional of the nonlinear strain tensor @xmath47 @xcite,@xmath48 while the last term is usually neglected in the linear theory elasticity of solids because solids behave elastically only under small deformations , it can be shown that only this nonlinear term contributes to the elasticity of gels and that the elastic part of the free energy of gels ( eq .",
    "( [ ai ] ) ) is linear in this nonlinear strain@xcite .",
    "physically , the difference between elastic energy _ of a solid , _ which is a quadratic form in the linear strain and _ of a gel , _ which is linear in the nonlinear strain tensor , stems from the fact that while in solids there is a stress - free state of equilibrium ( crystal lattice ) that minimizes the energy of interaction between the atoms , the equilibrium state of gels is not stress - free .",
    "polymer networks are made of entropic springs and , in the absence of osmotic pressure due to permeation by good solvent or due to excluded volume interactions in the melt state , such networks would collapse to the size of a single spring .",
    "the finite length of entropic springs in the swollen gel is the result of osmotic pressure which can be replaced by equivalent isotropic stretching forces that act on the outer boundaries of the gel @xcite .",
    "the difference between gels and solids becomes apparent when considering two simple toy models of heterogeneous gel and solid as two hookean springs with moduli @xmath49 and @xmath50 , connected in series as in fig .",
    "[ toy ] :    toy    _ a ) gel model : _ osmotic pressure is represented by a force @xmath51 applied to free ends of the connected springs . in the presence of this force",
    "the equilibrium lengths of the gaussian springs become @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and if we apply additional force @xmath54 , each of the springs will deform affinally with distance @xmath55 between the ends to which the force is applied ( boundaries  of the system ) : @xmath56    _ b ) solid model : _ the springs of a solid  have equilibrium lengths @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the stress - free state . during stretching due to force @xmath54",
    "applied to the ends of the two - spring system , such a solid deforms nonaffinelly:@xmath59{c}r_{1}=r_{1}^{\\text{eq}}+\\left (   \\lambda-1\\right )   \\left (   r_{1}^{\\text{eq}}+r_{2}^{\\text{eq}}\\right )   \\dfrac{k_{2}}{k_{1}+k_{2}},\\\\ r_{2}=r_{2}^{\\text{eq}}+\\left (   \\lambda-1\\right )   \\left (   r_{1}^{\\text{eq}}+r_{2}^{\\text{eq}}\\right )   \\dfrac{k_{1}}{k_{1}+k_{2}}\\end{array}\\ ] ] with the soft spring ( @xmath60 ) stretched more than the rigid one .",
    "these two simple toy models illustrate why under isotropic deformations , cross - linking density patterns in gels are stretched affinally , whereas soft regions in solids would undergo larger deformation compared to more rigid regions , thus distorting the original pattern .",
    "we studied the combined effect of swelling and deformation on inhomogeneous networks , prepared by cross - linking a melt of polymer chains .",
    "it is well - known that cross - link density heterogeneities that have no effect on the monomer density in the state of preparation ( a melt or a concentrated polymer solution ) , can be revealed by swelling the gel and observing the enhancement of light , x - ray and neutron scattering from the resulting monomer density inhomogeneities@xcite . in this paper we focused on a related phenomenon , namely that when large - scale cross - link density patterns are written into the network structure , the hidden image can be revealed by swelling and stretching the gel and observing the corresponding patterns of monomer density . using the mean field theory of elasticity of polymer gels we showed that stretching / swelling in good solvent acts as a magnifying glass : while isotropic stretching reproduces an enlarged but otherwise undistorted version of the original pattern , anisotropic stretching distorts this pattern , see figure  [ pattern ] .",
    "we compared these results with those obtained for ordinary elastic solids with inhomogeneous elastic moduli and found that in this case even isotropic deformations lead to distorted patterns .",
    "we showed that the fundamental difference between response of inhomogeneous gels and solids to isotropic stretching can be traced back to the fact that unlike regular springs that have an equilibrium length even in the absence of stress , the equilibrium length of entropic springs is entirely determined by the osmotic forces that isotropically stretch the polymer gel .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the possibility of experimental verification and on possible applications of our results . in most application involving gels such as biomimetic sensors , actuators and artificial muscles @xcite",
    ", macroscopically inhomogeneous ( layered ) gels undergo shape transitions when the thermodynamic conditions are changed or in response to application of external fields @xcite . in our case , the cross - link density pattern imprinted into the gel structure by , say , activation of light - sensitive cross - links , can be microscopic ( micron size ) and therefore would have little effect on the shape of the gel . upon swelling and/or isotropic stretching in good solvent , the magnified density pattern can be imaged on a light - sensitive screen .",
    "the contrast can be significantly enhanced by stretching the entire gel in poor solvent or by focusing a laser beam on the localized pattern and heating it , resulting in local change of the quality of solvent .",
    "finally , the sensitivity of the image to quality of solvent ( the distortion under anisotropic deformation disappears in @xmath0 solvent - see si ) can be useful for sensor devices .",

    "we show that patterns obtained by cross - linking a semi - dilute polymer solution , deform affinely ( non - affinely ) under isotropic ( anisotropic ) deformation , just like in the case of cross - linking in the melt .",
    "we then analyze how the pattern deforms under several different solvent conditions .",
    "we show that the pattern always stretches affinely in a @xmath0-solvent , even under anisotropic deformations .",
    "since the contrast between the high and the low monomer density regions can be significantly enhanced in a poor solvent we proceed to analyze the density profiles in gels that are isotropically stretched in mildly poor solvents ( at lower solubility , such stretched gels will undergo a transition into a strongly inhomogeneous state characterized by the appearance of dense filamentous structures @xcite ) .",
    "we find that when the amplitude of cross - link density variations is sufficiently low , the image stretches affinely with the isotropic deformation but that for larger density contrasts the image becomes distorted , especially near the edges and corners of the pattern .",
