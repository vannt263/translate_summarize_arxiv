    "the exchange - correlation ( xc ) kernel is a quantity of central importance both in time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) and in time - dependent current density functional theory ( tdcdft ) .",
    "it is formally defined as the functional derivative of the time - dependent xc potential @xmath0 with respect to time - dependent density in tddft , or as the functional derivative of time - dependent xc vector potential @xmath1 with respect to time - dependent current - density @xmath2 in tdcdft . in practice , this kernel connects the physical density- and current response functions of the interacting many - body system to those of a fictitious non - interacting system  the so - called kohn - sham system  which has the exact ground - state density .",
    "more precisely , one has ^-1=_s^-1-f_xc - v_c(|-| ) [ fxcs_def ] in tddft@xcite and ^-1=_s^-1-f_xc - v_c(|-| )  [ fxc_def ] in tdcdft.@xcite here @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the exact density and current response functions ( the second being a tensor , as emphasized by the hat ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are their kohn - sham counterparts , @xmath7 is the frequency , @xmath8 is the velocity of light , @xmath9 is the absolute value of the charge of electron , and @xmath10 is the coulomb interaction .",
    "the great importance of the @xmath11 kernels stems from the fact that the kohn - sham response functions usually misrepresent both the response and the excitation spectrum of the system .",
    "poles of @xmath5 , for example , occur at differences of kohn - sham eigenvalues , which are known to be , at least conceptually , unrelated to the true excitation energies of the system .",
    "it is the task of @xmath11 to shift the poles of the ks response functions from these unphysical values to the actual physical ones , and this is a very difficult task , particularly when it comes to band gaps and excitons .",
    "very few exact results are known about @xmath11 . even in the simplest case of a homogeneous electron gas ( in which case @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "are functions of @xmath13 and @xmath12 decomposes into independent longitudinal and transversal components ) very little is known .",
    "the static limit of @xmath14 has been calculated by variational and diffusion quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and fitted to simple formulas .",
    "@xcite it provides the basis for the so - called adiabatic approximation , which is based on the assumption that the exchange - correlation potential relaxes to the ground - state form on a time scale that is much shorter than the time scale of the evolution of the system . in the opposite limit of high - frequency , the quantity @xmath15 is known from exact sum rules to be expressible in terms of the density , the ground - state kinetic energy , and the ground - state pair correlation function ( or equivalently the static structure factor ) , all of which can be obtained from qmc calculations .",
    "this limit provides the basis for an  anti - adiabatic approximation \" , in which @xmath11 is interpreted as the stiffness of the ground - state wave function with respect to instantaneous virtual deformations .",
    "this point will be expounded more fully in the following .",
    "the frequency dependence of the homogeneous kernels has been the object of several parametrizations , beginning with the one by gross and kohn in 1985 @xcite ( see also refs . and ) , which interpolate between low- and high - frequency limit , and incorporate as many exact properties and constraints as possible .",
    "perturbative calculations , which treat electron exchange exactly , have also been carried out .",
    "@xcite    historically , the xc kernels of the homogeneous electron gas have played ( and still play ) an important role as the basis for local density approximations , whereby the xc kernels of the non - homogeneous systems are approximated in terms of those of a homogeneous system , evaluated at the local density .",
    "however , it has become clear in recent years that some features of the exact kernels can not be reproduced by the local density approximation .",
    "for example , it is now known that the exact scalar xc kernel has a singularity at finite frequency and @xmath16 ( corresponding to long range in space ) , which plays an important role in the optical spectra of extended system . reining _",
    "@xcite introduced phenomenologically a singular @xmath11 , and using it  on top \" of bands calculated by the gw method demonstrated considerable improvement in the calculated optical spectrum of silicon .",
    "one way to introduce a singular @xmath11 from first principles is to derive it from a local density approximation for the tensor @xmath12 of tdcdft .",
    "indeed , any regular approximation for @xmath12 , when translated into an approximation for @xmath11 , does produce a singularity of the expected form.@xcite the extent to which this may help to resolve the difficulties in the calculation of optical spectra remains unclear .",
    "further it now appears that not only the singular behavior of @xmath11 at @xmath17 , but also the detailed non - local spatial dependence of this kernel plays a role in the calculation of the optical spectra .    in view of these difficulties",
    "it seems particularly timely to try and learn as much as possible about the exact properties of @xmath11 in non - uniform systems . in a recent paper",
    "we have taken a first step in this direction by deriving an exact expression for the @xmath11 of a weakly inhomogeneous system to second - order in the strength of the external potential.@xcite this expression involves the kernels of the homogeneous electron gas ( which , as discussed above , are still poorly described ) , but is otherwise fully nonlocal .",
    "unfortunately , the perturbative approach restricts us to metals , and seems to exclude a priori the interesting case of semiconductors .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the exchange - correlation kernels for arbitrary non - homogeneous systems in the anti - adiabatic limit .",
    "as remarked above , the anti - adiabatic limit of the _ homogeneous _ exchange - correlation kernel is well known ( a state - of - the - art formula for it is provided in the appendix ) .",
    "here we extend that knowledge to the considerably more complex case of a non - homogeneous system . in spite of the additional complication , we are still able to express the result in terms of ground - state density , kinetic stress tensor , pair correlation function and exact exchange - correlation potential .",
    "all these quantities are well within the reach of modern numerical algorithms , and therefore our results open the way to an accurate study of @xmath11 in the anti - adiabatic limit .",
    "the high - frequency response of quantum many - body systems has recently come under intense scrutiny in the context of the continuum mechanics formulation of quantum many - body theory.@xcite in this theory one attempts to describe the dynamics in terms of a displacement field @xmath18 , describing the displacement of an infinitesimal volume element from its  equilibrium position \" in the ground - state ( in this approach the time - evolution is described as a geometric deformation of the ground - state ) .",
    "it turns out that the simplest approximation that leads to an eigenvalue problem for the excitation energies is in fact equivalent to a high - frequency expansion for the current response function .",
    "we get m ( , t)&= & - v_1(,t ) + & - & d * m*(, ) ( ,t ) , where @xmath19 is the ground - state density , and the tensor @xmath20 is the first moment of the current excitation spectrum [ see eq .  ( [ main_comm ] ) ] .",
    "this quantity can be expressed in terms of ground - state properties , i.e. , it is the second variational derivative of the ground - state energy with respect to the instantaneous displacement field @xmath21 , evaluated at @xmath22 .",
    "we will see that @xmath20 also plays a crucial role in the construction of @xmath23 .",

    "this is also observed at finite frequency , and , indeed all the way to zero frequency , as first noticed by holas@xcite and then confirmed by quantum monte carlo@xcite and diagrammatic calculations.@xcite in particular , the exact relation @xmath122  @xcite is well satisfied ."

    "<S> we express the high - frequency ( anti - adiabatic ) limit of the exchange - correlation kernels of an inhomogeneous electron gas in terms of the following equilibrium properties : the ground - state density , the kinetic stress tensor , the pair - correlation function , and the ground - state exchange - correlation potential . of these quantities , </S>",
    "<S> the first three are amenable to exact evaluation by quantum monte carlo methods , while the last can be obtained from the inversion of the kohn - sham equation for the ground - state orbitals . the exact scalar kernel , in this limit , is found to be of very long range in space , at variance with the kernel that is used in the standard local density approximation . the anti - adiabatic xc kernels should be useful in calculations of excitation energies by time - dependent dft in atoms , molecules , and solids , and provides a solid basis for interpolation between the low- and high - frequency limits of the xc kernels . </S>"
