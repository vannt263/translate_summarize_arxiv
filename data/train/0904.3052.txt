    "the conditions for a dynamical generation of this asymmetry ( baryogenesis ) are well known @xcite and depending on how they are realized different scenarios for baryogenesis can be defined ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a througout discussion ) .",
    "leptogenesis @xcite is a scenario in which an initial lepton asymmetry , generated in the out - of - equilibrium decays of heavy standard model singlet majorana neutrinos ( @xmath2 ) , is partially converted in a baryon asymmetry by anomalous sphaleron interactions  @xcite that are standard model processes .",
    "singlet majorana neutrinos are an essential ingredient for the generation of light neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "this means that if the seesaw is the source of neutrino masses then qualitatively leptogenesis is unavoidable .",
    "consequently , whether the baryon asymmetry puzzle can be solved within this framework turn out to be a quantitative question . this has triggered a great deal of interest on quantitative analysis of the standard leptogenesis model and indeed a lot of progress during the last years have been achieved ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "here we focus on variations of the standard leptogenesis picture which can arise if , apart from the lepton number breaking scale ( @xmath3 ) , an additional energy scale , related to the breaking of a new symmetry , exist .",
    "we consider a simple realization of this idea in which at an energy scale of the order of the lepton number violating scale the tree level coupling linking light and heavy neutrinos is forbiden by an exact @xmath0 flavor symmetry which below ( or above ) @xmath3 becomes spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value , @xmath4 , of a standard model singlet scalar field @xmath5 and involves heavy vectorlike fields @xmath6 .",
    "as will be discussed , according to the relative size of the relevant scales of the model ( @xmath7 , @xmath4 , @xmath8 ) , different scenarios for leptogenesis can be defined @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the case in which the total cp violating ( cpv ) asymmetries in the decays and scatterings of the singlet seesaw neutrinos vanish .",
    "as we will discuss further on two remarkable features distinguish this scenario @xcite : ( @xmath9 ) flavor effects are entirely responsible for successful leptogenesis ; ( @xmath10 ) leptogenesis can be lowered down to the tev scale .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we briefly discuss the model while in section  [ sec : different - possibilities ] we discuss two particular realizations of our scheme paying special attention to the _ purely flavored leptogenesis _",
    "( pfl ) case for which we analyse the evolution of the generated lepton asymmetry by solving the corresponding boltzmann equations ( be ) .",
    "the model we consider here @xcite is a simple extension of the standard model containing a set of @xmath11 fermionic singlets , namely three right - handed neutrinos ( @xmath12 ) and three heavy vectorlike fields ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "in addition , we assume that at some high energy scale , taken to be of the order of the leptogenesis scale @xmath14 , an exact @xmath0 horizontal symmetry forbids direct couplings of the lepton @xmath15 and higgs @xmath16 doublets to the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath2 . at lower energies ,",
    "@xmath0 gets spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath4 of a @xmath17 singlet scalar field @xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , the yukawa interactions of the high energy lagrangian read @xmath18 we use greek indices @xmath19 to label the heavy majorana neutrinos , latin indices @xmath20 for the vectorlike messengers , and @xmath21 for the lepton flavors @xmath22 . following reference @xcite we chose the simple @xmath0 charge assignments",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this assignment is sufficient to enforce the absence of @xmath26 terms , but clearly it does not constitute an attempt to reproduce the fermion mass pattern , and accordingly we will also avoid assigning specific charges to the right - handed leptons and quark fields that have no relevance for our analysis . the important point is that it is likely that any flavor symmetry ( of the froggatt - nielsen type ) will forbid the the same tree - level couplings , and will reproduce an overall model structure similar to the one we are assuming here",
    ". therefore we believe that our results , that are focused on a new realization of the leptogenesis mechanism , can hint to a general possibility that could well occur also in a complete model of flavor .    as discussed in  @xcite , depending on the hierarchy between the relevant scales of the model ( @xmath27 ) , quite different _ scenarios _ for leptogenesis can arise . here",
    "we will concentrate on two cases : ( @xmath28 ) the standard leptogenesis case ( @xmath29 ) ; ( @xmath30 ) the pfl case ( @xmath31 ) that is , when the flavor symmetry @xmath0 is still unbroken during the leptogenesis era and at the same time the messengers @xmath6 are too heavy to be produced in @xmath32 decays and scatterings , and can be integrated away @xcite .    as is explicitly shown by the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) , in general the vectorlike fields can couple to the heavy singlet neutrinos via scalar and pseudoscalar couplings , in ref .  @xcite it was assumed for simplicity a strong hierarchy @xmath33",
    "so @xmath34 was neglected .",
    "however , in all the relevant quantities ( scatterings , cp asymmetries , light neutrino masses ) at leading order the scalar and pseudoscscalar couplings always appear in the combination @xmath35 , and thus such an assumption is not necessary . the replacement @xmath36 would suffice to include in the analysis the effects of both type of interactions .",
    "after @xmath0 and electroweak symmetry breaking the set of yukawa interactions in ( [ eq : lag ] ) generate light neutrino masses through the effective mass operator shown in figure [ fig : neutrino - massmatrix ] .",
    "the resulting mass matrix can be written as @xcite @xmath37_{ij }    = \\left [      \\tilde{\\lambda}^{t}\\frac{v^{2}}{m_{n}}\\tilde{\\lambda }    \\right]_{ij } \\,.\\ ] ] here we have introduced the seesaw - like couplings @xmath38 note that , in contrast to the standard seesaw , the neutrino mass matrix is of fourth order in the _ fundamental _ yukawa couplings ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) and due to the factor @xmath41 is even more suppressed .",
    "in this section we discuss the features of each one of the cases we previously mentioned and derive expressions for the cp asymmetries .",
    "henceforth we will use the following notation for the different mass ratios : @xmath42      when the masses of the heavy fields @xmath6 and the @xmath0 symmetry breaking scale are both larger than the majorana neutrino masses ( @xmath43 ) there are no major differences from the standard fukugita - yanagida leptogenesis model @xcite . after integrating out the @xmath44 fields one obtains the standard seesaw lagrangian containing the effective operators @xmath45 with the seesaw couplings @xmath46 given in eq .",

    "the right handed neutrino @xmath32 decays predominantly via 2-body channels as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : case0 ] .",
    "this yields the standard results that for convenience we recall here .",
    "the total decay width is @xmath47 and the sum of the vertex and self - energy contributions to the @xmath48-asymmetry for @xmath32 decays into the flavor @xmath49 reads @xcite @xmath50\\right\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 at leading order in @xmath52 and after summing over all leptons @xmath49 , eq .",

    "it is now easy to see that ( [ eq : di ] ) implies a lower limit on @xmath14 .",
    "the amount of @xmath61 asymmetry that can be generated from @xmath32 dynamics can be written as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 accounts for the dilution of the asymmetry due to the increase of the universe entropy from the time the asymmetry is generated with respect to the present time , @xmath64 ( that can range between 0 and 1 , with typical values @xmath65 ) is the _ efficiency factor _ that accounts for the amount of @xmath66 asymmetry that can survive the washout process . assuming that @xmath67 is the main source of the @xmath68 asymmetry  @xcite , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : di ] ) and ( [ eq : etab ] ) in addition from the oserved baryon asymmetry eq .",
    "( [ eq : baryon - asymm ] ) yield : @xmath69 this limit can be somewhat relaxed depending on the specific initial conditions  @xcite or when flavor effects are included  @xcite but the main point remains , and that is that the value of @xmath14 should be well above the electroweak scale .          differently from standard leptogenesis in the present case , since @xmath70 , two - body @xmath32 decays are kinematically forbidden .",
    "however , via off - shell exchange of the heavy @xmath6 fields , @xmath32 can decay to the three body final states @xmath71 and @xmath72 . the corresponding feynman diagram is depicted in figure [ fig : fig0]@xmath73 . at leading order in @xmath74 ,",
    "the total decay width reads @xcite @xmath75 as usual , cpv asymmetries in @xmath32 decays arise from the interference between tree - level and one - loop amplitudes . as was noted in  @xcite , in this model at one - loop there are no contributions from vertex corrections , and the only contribution to the cpv asymmetries comes from the self - energy diagram  [ fig : fig0]@xmath76 .",
    "summing over the leptons and vectorlike fields running in the loop , at leading order in @xmath77 the cpv asymmetry for @xmath32 decays into leptons of flavor @xmath78 can be written as @xmath79}{\\left(\\tilde{\\lambda}\\tilde{\\lambda}^{\\dagger}\\right)_{11}}\\,.\\ ] ] note that since the loop correction does not violate lepton number , the total cpv asymmetry that is obtained by summing over the flavor of the final state leptons vanishes  @xcite , that is @xmath80 .",
    "this is the condition that defines pfl ; namely there is no cpv _ and _ lepton number violating asymmetry , and the cpv lepton flavor asymmetries are the only seed of the cosmological lepton and baryon asymmetries .",
    "it is important to note that the effective couplings @xmath81 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : seesaw - couplings ] ) are invariant under the reparameterization @xmath82        where @xmath83 is an arbitrary @xmath84 non - singular matrix .",
    "clearly the light neutrino mass matrix is invariant under this transformation .",
    "moreover , also the flavor dependent washout processes , that correspond to tree level amplitudes that are determined , to a good approximation , by the effective @xmath85 couplings , are left essentially unchanged .-",
    "propagators @xmath86 . ] on the contrary , the flavor cpv asymmetries eq .  (",
    "[ eq : cp - violating - asymm ] ) , that are determined by loop amplitudes containing an additional factor of @xmath87 , get rescaled as @xmath88 .",
    "clearly , this rescaling affects in the same way all the lepton flavors ( as it should be to guarantee that the pfl conditions @xmath89 are not spoiled ) , and thus for simplicity we will consider only rescaling by a global scalar factor @xmath90 ( with @xmath91 the @xmath84 identity matrix ) that , for our purposes , is completely equivalent to the more general transformation  ( [ eq : couplingtrans ] ) .",
    "thus , while rescaling the yukawa couplings through @xmath92 does not affect neither low energy neutrino physics nor the washout processes , the cpv asymmetries get rescaled as : @xmath93 by choosing @xmath94 , all the cpv asymmetries get enhanced as @xmath95 and , being the cosmological asymmetries generated through leptogenesis linear in the cpv asymmetries , the final result gets enhanced by the same factor .",
    "therefore , for any given set of couplings , one can always find an appropriate rescaling such that the correct amount of cosmological lepton asymmetry is generated . in practice",
    ", the rescaling factors @xmath96 can not be arbitrarily large : first , they should respect the condition that all the fundamental yukawa couplings remain in the perturbative regime ; second the size of the @xmath39 couplings ( and thus also of the rescaling parameter @xmath96 ) is also constrained by experimental limits on lepton flavor violating decays .     and @xmath97 @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 channel processes after integrating out the heavy vectorlike fields @xmath6.,width=491,height=86 ]      in this section we compute the lepton asymmetry by solving the appropriate be . in general , to consistently derive the evolution equation of the lepton asymmetry all the possible processes at a given order in the couplings have to be included . in the present case",
    "@xmath101 decays and inverse decays , and @xmath102 @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 channel scatterings all occur at the same order in the couplings and must be included altogether in the be .",
    "the feynman diagrams for these processes are shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "in addition , the cpv asymmetries of some higher order multiparticle reactions involving the exchange of one off - shell @xmath32 , also contribute to the source term of the asymmetries at the same order in the couplings than the cpv asymmetries of decays and @xmath102 scatterings .",
    "more precisely , for a proper derivation of the be it is essential that the cpv asymmetries of the off - shell @xmath103 and @xmath104 scattering processes are also taken into account @xcite .    as regards the equation for the evolution of the heavy neutrino density @xmath105 , only the diagrams in fig .",

    "we have used the compact notation for the reaction densities @xmath113 and in addition we have defined @xmath114 where in the second equation @xmath115 represents the sum of the cp conjugates of the processes summed in @xmath116 .    since in this model @xmath32",
    "decays are of the same order in the couplings than scatterings ( that is @xmath117 ) , the appropriate condition that defines the _ strong washout _ regime in the case at hand reads : @xmath118 and conversely @xmath119 defines the _ weak washout _ regime .",
    "note that this is different from standard leptogenesis , where at @xmath120 two body decays generally dominate over scatterings , and e.g. the condition for the strong washout regime can be approximated as @xmath121 .      in this section",
    "we discuss a typical example of successful leptogenesis at the scale of a few tev .",
    "the example presented is a general one .",
    "no particular choice of the parameters has been performed , except for the fact that the low energy neutrino data are reproduced within errors , and that the choice yields an interesting washout dynamics well suited to illustrate how pfl works .",
    "the numerical value of the final lepton asymmetry ( @xmath122 ) is about a factor of 3 _ larger _ than what is indicated by measurements of the cosmic baryon asymmetry .",
    "this is however irrelevant since , as was already discussed , it would be sufficient a minor rescaling of the couplings ( or a slight change in the cpv phases ) to obtain the precise experimental result . in the numerical analysis we have neglected the dynamics of the heavier singlet neutrinos since the @xmath2 masses are sufficiently hierarchical to ensure that @xmath123 related washouts do not interfere with @xmath32 dynamics .",
    "moreover , in the ( strong washout ) fully flavored regime ( that is effective as long as @xmath124gev ) the @xmath123 cpv asymmetries do not contribute to the final lepton number asymmetry  @xcite .    in figure",

    "the total reaction densities that determine the washout rates for the different flavors are shown in the first panel in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "the evolution of these rates with @xmath126 should be confronted with the evolution of ( the absolute value of ) the asymmetry densities for each flavor , depicted in the second panel on the right . since , as already stressed several times , pfl is defined by the condition that the sum of the flavor cpv asymmetry vanishes ( @xmath145 ) , it is the hierarchy between these washout rates that in the end is the responsible for generating a net lepton number asymmetry . in the case at hand ,",
    "the absolute values of the flavor cpv asymmetries satisfy the condition @xmath146 , when the effects of the washouts are still negligible , the asymmetry densities satisfy this hierarchy . moreover , since @xmath147 while @xmath148 , initially the total lepton number asymmetry , that is dominated by @xmath149 , is positive .",
    "as washout effects become important , the @xmath135-related reactions ( blue dotted line in the left panel ) start erasing @xmath149 more efficiently than what happens for the other two flavors , and thus the initial positive asymmetry is driven towards zero , and eventually changes sign around @xmath150 .",
    "this change of sign corresponds to the steep valley in the absolute value @xmath151 that is drawn in the figure with a black solid line . note that when all flavors are in the strong washout regime , as in the present case , the condition for the occurrence of this ` sign inversions ' is simply given by @xmath152 .",
    "from this point onwards , the asymmetry remains negative , and since the electron flavor is the one that suffers the weakest washout , @xmath153 ends up dominating all the other density asymmetries .",
    "in fact , as can be seen from the right panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] , it is @xmath153 that determines to a large extent the final value of the lepton asymmetry @xmath154 .",
    "a few comments are in order regarding the role played by the @xmath6 fields .",
    "even if @xmath155 , at large temperatures @xmath141 the tail of the thermal distributions of the @xmath156 and @xmath16 particles allows the on - shell production of the lightest @xmath44 states . a possible asymmetry generated in the decays of the @xmath44 fields",
    "can be ignored for two reasons : first because due to the rather large @xmath39 and @xmath40 couplings @xmath44 decays occur to a good approximation in thermal equilibrium , ensuring that no sizeable asymmetry can be generated , and second because the strong washout dynamics that characterizes @xmath32 leptogenesis at lower temperatures is in any case insensitive to changes in the initial conditions .    in conclusion",
    ", it is clear from the results of this section that the model encounters no difficulties to allow for the possibility of generating the cosmic baryon asymmetry at a scale of a few tevs . moreover , our analysis provides a concrete example of pfl , and shows that the condition @xmath157 is by no means required for successful leptogenesis .",
    "variations of the standard leptogenesis picture can arise from the presence of an additional energy scale different from that of lepton number violation .",
    "quite generically the resulting scenarios are expected to yield qualitative and quantitative changes on leptogenesis .",
    "here we have considered what we regard as the simplest possibility namely , the presence of an abelian flavor symmetry @xmath0 .",
    "we have described two possible scenarios within this framework and have explored their implications for leptogenesis .",
    "we have found that as long as the abelian flavor symmetry energy scales remain above the lepton number violating scale neither qualitative nor quantitative differences with the standard leptogenesis model arise .",
