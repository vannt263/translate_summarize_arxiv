    "a point pattern as a realization of a point process is a set of points that are distributed irregularly in a window .",
    "the analysis of a point pattern provides information on the geometrical structures formed by the aggregation and interaction between points .",
    "the aggregation and interaction of points are characterized by intensity and covariance density functions , respectively .",
    "the spectral density function of a stationary point process is the fourier transform of the complete covariance density function and is estimated in an asymptotically unbiased manner by the spatial periodogram . for a stationary point process all the second - order characteristics ( e.g. , the complete covariance density function ) are only a function of inter - points distances and thus the spectral density function does not depend on the locations of points .",
    "so , the structure of the complete covariance density and spectral density functions may vary with location when the stationarity assumption is violated .",
    "several efficient methods based on the spectral density are available in the literature for studying the spatial structure of stationary processes .",
    "the spectral methods were used by @xcite to investigate the asymptotic properties of several estimation procedures for a stationary process observed on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice .",
    "the approximated locations of events in a spatial point pattern were presented using the intersections of a fine lattice on the observation window by @xcite and the point spectrum was approximated by the lattice spectrum .",
    "generally , a vague boundary exists between stationary and nonstationary point processes containing zonal stationary .",
    "the source of nonstationarity of these processes is the local regular behavior .",
    "these processes are further explained in section [ preliminaries ] .",
    "based on a point pattern , we want to decide between the zonal stationarity and the simple stationarity assumption .",
    "one may suggest to employ the methods developed for regular observation of random fields . to this end , since the point pattern is an irregular observation of points , we need to partition the observation window , @xmath1 , into a regular @xmath0-dimensional grid where the @xmath2th edge of @xmath1 is divided into @xmath3 , @xmath4 , equidistant parts .",
    "let @xmath5 represent the number of points in the sub- cube in the @xmath6th row , where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "we consider the @xmath5 as a measured variable at the @xmath6th grid and evaluate the stationarity of the point pattern by testing the stationarity of @xmath9 random field .",
    "this test is similar to the test for stationarity of random fields introduced by @xcite which looses the information about the locations of points . in the second approach ,",
    "we define the evolutionary spectra for the realization of a point process and then examine the local behavior of the discrete evolutionary spectra .",
    "the stationarity assumption is rejected if the spectral density function shows different behavior at least in two different regions of the window .",
    "we mention the property of different behaviors in different regions by _ second - order location dependency_. our method is designed to detect this behavior against the second- order stationarity .",
    "the concept of evolutionary ( i.e. time - dependent ) spectra has been introduced by @xcite .",
    "testing the stationarity of time series is a very famous consequences of this concept @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic properties of nonstationary time series with locally stationary behavior was investigated by @xcite using the time - dependent spectra .",
    "the remaining references somehow used the the evolutionary or local spectra for testing the stationarity of regular trajectories of random fields except @xcite which proposed a test for spatial stationarity based on a transformation of irregularly spaced spatial data .",
    "a nonparametric and several parametric procedures for modeling the spatial dependence structure of a nonstationary spatial process observed on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice was proposed by @xcite .",
    "priestley s idea was extended to test the stationarity and isotropy of a spatial process @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the local variogram for testing the stationarity assumption of a random process was employed in @xcite .",
    "a formal test for stationarity of spatial random fields on the bases of the asymptotic normality of certain covariance estimators at certain spatial lags was derived by @xcite .",
    "a wavelet - based analysis of variance for a stationary random field on a regular lattice was used by @xcite for testing the stationarity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the sequel , we study two motivating datasets . in the following section , we review some concepts of point processes and present two spatial spectral representations for a nonstationary spatial point process .",
    "moreover , the nonparametric estimates of the spectral density of a nonstationary point process are proposed in this section .",
    "a formal test of stationarity is presented in section [ test ] . in section [ simulation ] , we examine the proposed testing approaches via a simulation study .",
    "we also study the effect of location in the competition between a specific genus of trees in [ realdata ] .      in this section , we propose two datasets as well as motivations for data analysis in order to further illustrate the mentioned problem throughout this study .",
    "the first dataset is devoted to the location of _ euphorbiaceae _ trees in a part of the bar colorado forest ( figure [ real data1 ] ) .",
    "generally , one of the main and essential information for forest management and its optimal and sustainable utilization is to determine the frequencies of different types of trees , distribution pattern of trees , and their competition .",
    "for example , the distribution of trees seeds could have an impact on their aggregation while competition among different species for moisture , light , and nutrients acts vice versa .",
    "a positive autocorrelation or aggregation may result from regeneration near parents , whilst a negative autocorrelation results from their competition .",
    "therefore , it seems that variations of the aggregation structure will be change the interaction structure of trees .",
    "since the local periodogram is influenced by the aggregation and interactions of points , so we use this function for detecting the location(s ) at which the structure of trees pattern is changed .",
    "trees of the bar colorado forest in a rectangular window whose vertices are located at the geographic coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the sampling window is rescaled into @xmath12 ^{2}$ ] . ]",
    "the second data is the location of capillary profiles on a section of prostate tissue .",
    "according to the anatomy of the human body , blood circulation in the human body starts from heart , then flows through arteries , and finally receives to all parts of the body by capillaries .",
    "capillaries are the smallest vessels of the body , supplying the oxygen to tissues and exchanging constituents between tissues and blood .",
    "figure [ real data2 ] manifests the midpoints of the capillaries in sections of healthy and cancerous prostate tissues .",
    "the rescaled point patterns published by @xcite were used to capture the coordinates of the capillaries .",
    "since the quantity of nutrients and oxygen required by different parts of a given organ of the body are not same , so it is expected that the density of capillary network will be different in various parts of the body . in order to scrutinize this issue",
    ", we examine the behavior of evolutionary periodogram function at different parts of a tissue .    0.3   capillaries on a section of a healthy prostate ( [ healthy ] ) and the locations of @xmath13 capillaries at the same section from a cancerous prostate ( [ cancerous]).,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.3   capillaries on a section of a healthy prostate ( [ healthy ] ) and the locations of @xmath13 capillaries at the same section from a cancerous prostate ( [ cancerous]).,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "a point process is called stationary if its distribution is invariant under translations and is called isotropic if its distribution is invariant under rotations about the origin in @xmath14 . for a stationary point process the intensity function is constant and the second - order characteristics depend only on the lag vector . moreover , for an isotropic process such dependency is an exclusive function of the scalar length of lag vector regardless of the orientation . moving to the frequency domain approaches ,",
    "the spectral density function of a point process is the fourier transform of the complete covariance density function .",
    "it is a function like @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the space of frequencies and is defined as ( see @xcite ) the fourier transform of the unit - free complete covariance density function , @xmath17 @xcite . for a nonstationary spatial process ,",
    "@xcite generalized the concept of evolutionary spectra of time series introduced by @xcite .",
    "following the same idea , we introduce two different evolutionary peridograms of nonstationary point processes .",
    "a new class of nonstationary point processes called ` zonal ' stationary processes is introduced . in each approach , an empirical spectral density function",
    "is defined for this class of nonstationary point process whose physical interpretation is similar to that of the spectrum of a stationary point process , but it is varying with location . intuitively , a point process is called zonal stationary if it behaves in an approximately stationary way in a neighborhood of some point .",
    "in other words , a point process @xmath18 is called zonal stationary on @xmath1 if there exist finite points @xmath19 such that for some @xmath20 , @xmath21 is stationary , where @xmath22 denotes the restriction of @xmath18 to @xmath23 and @xmath24 denotes a closed ball centered at @xmath25 with a radius @xmath26 .",
    "figure[fig1 ] shows a realization of zonal stationary point process in the window @xmath27 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "we term @xmath28 the middle points of @xmath29 square sub - windows from left to right and down to up , respectively . in this figure ,",
    "the point pattern in @xmath30 is a realization of the stationary thomas process , in @xmath31 we have a realization of the simple sequential inhibition ( ssi ) process and the remaining are realizations of stationary poisson processes .",
    "the regional behavior of a point pattern can be detected through evaluating its different features in the special regions .",
    "for this aim , closed balls with centers at different points of the observation window are typically considered in the spatial domain .",
    "moreover , the local behavior of the point pattern is decided on the basis of measuring its different features at these balls . however , determining these regions and different features are crucial in the spatial domain .",
    "fortunately , this issue can be easily solved in the frequency domain .",
    "this could be attributed to the fact that the frequency domain is based on @xmath32 $ ] regardless of the form of the observation window .",
    "the bartlett window can be used to determine different regions on which the features must be evaluated and accordingly the regional behavior of the point pattern can be detected by computing the local periodogram .",
    "suppose that we have a point process @xmath33 observed on a rectangular window @xmath34 $ ] , where @xmath35 , that is the rectangular window with a vertex at the origin of the cartesian coordinates and an opposite vertex on @xmath36 .",
    "construct @xmath37 as before .",
    "we consider a regular @xmath38 grid on the study area and set @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the number of points in the @xmath6th row where @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "we consider the @xmath5 as a measured variable at the @xmath6th quadrant and define the random field as @xmath43 if @xmath44 belongs to the @xmath6th row .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the image of @xmath5 random field obtained by considering a @xmath45 regular grid on @xmath46 .",
    "random field corresponding to the mentioned point pattern in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "]    now , one may use the method of @xcite to define the local periodogram of the obtained random field which eliminate the information about the locations .",
    "our approach is the nonstationary periodogram .",
    "assume that we have a point pattern @xmath47 observed on a rectangular window @xmath48 $ ] containing @xmath49 points .",
    "let @xmath50 , be the set of positions of the points .",
    "suppose the approximate locations of points in a point pattern be represented by the intersections of a @xmath51 fine lattice superimposed on the study region .",
    "this lattice generates an irregular realization of a binary random field . we define the obtained realization , @xmath52 say , from the random field @xmath53 as @xmath54 @xmath55 is a simple random field and only the positions at which events occur are of interest .",
    "there is an equivalence between the point spectra of @xmath18 and the spectra of the random field @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath18 is a stationary point process , then @xmath56 will be a stationary random field .",
    "consequently , any evidence of nonstationarity of @xmath57 could be a reason for rejection of the stationarity hypothesis of @xmath33 .",
    "suppose that @xmath53 be zonal stationary , then its spectral density function , denoted by @xmath58 , is the fourier transform of the locally auto covariance function of @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the location around that @xmath53 behaves in a stationary manner ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if for a given @xmath61 the function @xmath62 is not sensitive to @xmath63 , then we conclude that in the neighborhood of the given @xmath60 , @xmath64 belongs to a completely spatial random point pattern . on the other hand , if for a given frequency @xmath63 , @xmath64 is not sensitive to @xmath65 , then we conclude that for the given @xmath63 , @xmath64 dose not behave locally .",
    "practically , @xmath64 is unknown for every @xmath60 and for every @xmath66 and we restrict the problem of estimation to specific fourier frequencies and locations .",
    "therefore , our approach is a parametric statistical inference .",
    "consider a location varying filter to assign greater weights to the neighboring values of @xmath60 .",
    "the spatial local periodogram at a location @xmath67 and frequency @xmath68 is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the filter function with all the characteristics mentioned by @xcite with finite width @xmath72 defined as @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the resulting periodogram is not smooth enough to be used as an estimation of the local spectra and thus @xmath75 is smoothed using the @xmath76 kernel family , @xmath77 , where for each @xmath78 there exists a constant @xmath79 such that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the fourier transform of @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the final estimator is @xmath83 using the very similar arguments employed by @xcite , the covariance between the spatial periodogram values @xmath84 and @xmath85 will be asymptotically zero if either @xmath86 bandwidth of @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the fourier transform of @xmath89 and or @xmath90 bandwidth of the function @xmath91 @xcite . for fixed @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    ", one may conclude the normality of @xmath92 and @xmath93 similar to the @xcite .",

    "the number of observed points of @xmath94 in the considered sub - windows are almost similar .",
    "obviously , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] , the behavior of the local periodogram function of @xmath94 varies at different locations .",
    "the shape of the local periodograms in sub - windows with stationary poisson patterns ( around @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) are broadly flat , reflecting the absence of the interaction structure in the observed patterns . in the sub - window with the stationary thomas pattern , for small values of @xmath98 the values of @xmath99 are larger in comparison with @xmath100 when @xmath101 . in contrast ,",
    "the sub - window with the simple sequential inhibition pattern , the values of @xmath102 are smaller than @xmath100 , @xmath101 , for small @xmath103 .     at the locations @xmath104 and fourier frequencies , title=\"fig : \" ]   at the locations @xmath104 and fourier frequencies , title=\"fig : \" ]   at the locations @xmath104 and fourier frequencies , title=\"fig : \" ] +   at the locations @xmath104 and fourier frequencies , title=\"fig : \" ]   at the locations @xmath104 and fourier frequencies , title=\"fig : \" ]   at the locations @xmath104 and fourier frequencies , title=\"fig : \" ] +   at the locations @xmath104 and fourier frequencies , title=\"fig : \" ]   at the locations @xmath104 and fourier frequencies , title=\"fig : \" ]   at the locations @xmath104 and fourier frequencies , title=\"fig : \" ] +   at the locations @xmath104 and fourier frequencies , title=\"fig : \" ]    there is a fundamental difference between this location dependent point spectra and the lattice - based local spectra considered by @xcite .",
    "a lattice - based spectrum describes the spatial structure of a measured variable ( for example , tree heights ) at fixed equally spaced locations in an @xmath105 grid .",
    "however , in a local point spectrum , we consider the spatial structure of the location ( for example , locations of trees ) of points instead of a measured characteristic .",
    "moreover , the first estimator ignores the information about the precise locations of points compared with the second one .",
    "concerning the bartlett s window , @xmath106 is considered as a multiplicative filter in the simulation study of section [ simulation ] ; i.e. @xmath107 , where @xmath108 .",
    "thus the fourier transform of @xmath89 becomes @xmath109 .",
    "further , we consider @xmath110 to be of the form @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , corresponding to the daniell window which implies the accuracy of formula with @xmath113 .",
    "in this section , we represent a formal test of stationarity of a point process based on the results discussed in the previous section.the analysis of the geometric structure of a point pattern is strongly related to the aggregation of points and interaction between points . when the aggregation of points is the same at two different sub - windows it is not easy to visually discriminate the interaction effect in these sub - windows . in this situation ,",
    "the higher moments of the point pattern such as the second order intensity function must be compared together in different areas .",
    "if the restricted point patterns to disjoint sub - windows are assumed to be independent , their second order properties can be compared according to @xcite . without such independence ,",
    "the _ two - factor analysis of variance _ model and the assumptions considered in the following are valid .",
    "we thus wright ( see also @xcite ) @xmath114 @xcite showed that for @xmath115 $ ] , the asymptotic mean and variance of @xmath116 are @xmath117 and @xmath118 which is independent of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we select a set of locations @xmath119 and a set of frequencies @xmath120 in such a way that an acceptable sample is gathered in location and frequency spaces and we evaluate @xmath121 over this fine sample .",
    "the set of locations and frequencies must also be wide apart enough in order to @xmath122 and consequently @xmath123 be uncorrelated .",
    "if we write @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , then using the discussion on the normality of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , the noise terms , @xmath129 , are considered to be normally distributed and @xmath130 are generated according to the model @xmath131 the parameter @xmath132 represents the treatment effect for location effect at level @xmath133 and the frequency effect at level @xmath134 . by considering the normality of the main effects , we can rewrite the model as @xmath135 in this model , the parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 represent the main effects of the location and frequency factors , respectively , and @xmath138 represents the interaction between these two factors . as previously mentioned , the spectral density function of a stationary point process does not oscillate locally and it only varies by change of the frequencies .",
    "therefore , the stationarity of a point process can be tested by using the analysis of variance methods and testing the model @xmath139 or equivalently @xmath140 versus ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "the rejection of @xmath141 represents that at least one of the parameters @xmath136 is not zero which means that there exists at least one @xmath142 in such a way that @xmath143 for all @xmath144 .",
    "a post - hoc test is used to find the different location(s ) and thus we may use this as a clustering method in zonal stationary point processes . since the value of @xmath145 is known , the presence of the interaction factor , @xmath138 , can be tested only using one realization of the point process . if the effect of interaction factor is not significant , then the point process is uniformly modulated and @xmath146 will be additive in terms of location and frequency .",
    "we can examine whether the nonstationarity of the point pattern is restricted only to some frequencies , by selecting those frequencies and testing for stationarity over them . if @xmath33 is an isotropic point process , then @xmath147 depends on its vector argument @xmath68 only through its scalar length @xmath148 , regardless of the orientation of @xmath68 .",
    "then , we can test for isotropy by selecting a set of frequencies with the same norms , say @xmath149 where @xmath150 but @xmath151 , and test whether the frequency effect is significant . since @xmath152 is known , all of these comparisons are based on a @xmath153 rather than @xmath154-test .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the performance of the proposed test for detecting the nonstationarity of a point process .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , using a logarithmic transformation , the mechanism of the test are almost identical to those of a two - factor analysis of variance procedure .    in testing for stationarity ,",
    "firstly we consider the interaction sum of squares .",
    "if the interaction is not significant , we conclude that the point process is a uniformly modulated process and continue to test for stationarity by evaluating the ` between spatial locations ' sum of squares .",
    "if the interaction sum of squares turns out to be significant , we conclude that the point pattern is nonuniformly modulated and nonstationary .",
    "in this situation , we can survey whether the nonstationarity of the point process is restricted only at some frequencies .",
    "significance of the ` between spatial locations ' sum of squares means that the point pattern is nonstationary .",
    "we set the nominal level of test at @xmath155 and assume that all of the point processes are observed on a rectangular window @xmath156 ^{2}$ ] . using , for all cases , we estimate @xmath147 in which @xmath157 and @xmath110 employ @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively .",

    "similarly , to evaluate between frequencies effect , @xmath188 is compared with @xmath189 and the significance of test confirms that the spectra is nonuniform .    in the following study , we simulate @xmath190 realizations from a stationary and a nonstationary point process to study the empirical size and power of the proposed test .",
