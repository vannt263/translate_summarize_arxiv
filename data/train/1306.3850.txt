    "the principal role of chaperones is to assist in the resolution of the multitude of alternative misfolded structures that rna readily adopts so that sufficient yield of the native material is realized in biologically viable time less than @xmath1 . because spontaneous yield of the native state of large ribozymes even at high mg@xmath18 concentrations is small @xcite",
    ", it is likely that _ in vivo _ rna chaperones are required to boost the probability of reaching the folded state within @xmath1 . unlike the well - studied bacterial groel - groes , a well - identified `` one - fit - all '' chaperonin system for processing cytosolic proteins @xcite , protein - cofactors that act as rna chaperones vary from one rna to the other @xcite .",
    "based on a number of experiments ( see @xcite for reviews ) we classify the client rna molecules into two classes depending on the need for the rna chaperones to utilize the free energy of atp hydrolysis in facilitating folding .    1",
    ".   folding of class i rna molecules is greatly aided by the interactions with protein cofactors while their assistance may not be strictly required .",
    "these rna molecules are not stringent rna substrates . for example , the splicing reaction of mitochondrial bi5 group i intron is activated in 50 mm or greater mg@xmath19 concentration at room temperature but interactions with cytochrome b pre - mrna processing protein 2 ( cbp2 ) or _ neurospora crassa _ mitochondrial tyrosyl trna synthetase ( cyt-18 ) enables splicing at physiological level ( @xmath57 mm ) of mg@xmath19 by enhancing folding of the bi5 core .",
    "tetrahymena _ ribozyme and other group i introns belong to stringent class ii substrates .",
    "spontaneous folding , even at high counterion concentration , occurs too slowly with low yield of the native state to be biologically viable . at high temperatures folding of the misfolded _ tetrahymena _",
    "ribozyme is aided by formation of ribonucleoprotein ( rnp ) assembly with the promiscuously interacting cyt-18 , which in essence follows the mechanism of passive assistance @xcite . however , an atp - dependent helicase activity associated cyt-19 produces functionally competent states that can splice efficiently at normal growth temperature .",
    "although not firmly established , it is suspected that rna chaperones bind to single stranded regions of the misfolded structures , which upon release places the rna in a different region of the folding landscape , giving it a new opportunity to fold just as anticipated by the iterative annealing model ( iam ) @xcite .    the fundamental difference between class i and class ii rna substrates is in the apparent time scale of catalysis ( @xmath20 ) by the ribonucleprotein ( rnp ) complex formed between rna and the rna chaperone .",
    "if this time scale is smaller than @xmath1 ( @xmath21 ) , the formation of rnp alone is sufficient to produce functionally competent rna molecules . in the opposite case ( @xmath22 )",
    ", the conversion of misfolded rna into folding competent form needs assistance from a specially designed action of rna chaperone that can transduce the free energy of atp hydrolysis . below we will describe a mathematical model for the two scenarios .",
    "the tertiary structure capture model @xcite accounts for the passive action of rna chaperones in the folding of mitochondrial bi5 group i intron without atp .",
    "explicit mechanisms of recognition by passive rna chaperones by the collapsed rnas may differ for different systems , and might also depend on whether the rna collapse is specific or non - specific . in a majority of cases",
    "ribozymes undergo an extended to a collapsed transition even at modest ion concentration producing a heterogeneous population of compact structures whose affinity for the protein cofactors could vary greatly .",
    "for example , cbp2 could bind to these compact structures with partially folded cores ( p5-p4-p6 and p3-p7-p8 ) of group i intron ( fig.[fig : passive_rnp]a ) with differing specificity , and promote the subsequent assembly of 5 domain of bi5 core .",
    "in contrast , cyt-18 binds to rna and forms a stable cyt-18-bi5 complex at an early stage of rna folding and promotes the splicing competent states @xcite .",
    "if the association between the cofactor and compact rna is too weak then large conformational fluctuations can produce long - lived entropically stabilized metastable kinetic traps for rna . in this case , the protein cofactor would have little effect on rna folding . in the opposite limit , when the cofactor interacts strongly with collapsed rna , transient unfolding in the rna conformations , which are needed for resolving misfolded structures to the native state , would be prohibited .",
    "thus , for the chaperone - assisted folding of class i rna substrates , an optimal stability of the rna - cofactor intermediate is needed to efficiently produce an assembly - competent rnp complex .    the physical picture of passive assistance of rna chaperones described above , encapsulated in the weeks - cech tertiary capture mechanism ,",
    "can be translated into the kinetic scheme shown in fig.[fig : passive_rnp ] . after rna collapses rapidly to an ensemble of collapsed intermediate structures \\{c } ( @xmath23 ) consisting of a mixture of specifically and non - specifically collapsed structures , promiscuous binding of chaperone ( blue spheres in [ fig : passive_rnp ] ) to the conformations in \\{c } produces a fluctuating ensemble of tightly and loosely bound intermediate rnp complex @xmath24 .",
    "this process is conceptually similar to the encounter complex in protein - protein interaction @xcite .",
    "only a fraction ( @xmath0 ) of states among the tightly bound ensemble of rnp , @xmath25 , is viable for producing functionally competent rnp state .",
    "thus , @xmath25 is partitioned roughly into @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the intermediate ensemble that can fold into the competent rnp while @xmath28 can not . since transitions among the states in @xmath25",
    "is non - permissible on viable time scales , the only way for a molecule trapped in @xmath28 to reach the competent rnp state is to visit a transiently unbound ( or loosely bound ) intermediate ensemble @xmath29 and explore the states belonging to @xmath27 .",

    "defining a constant for rapid pre - equilibration ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) between the two collapsed intermediate ensembles @xmath36_{ss}/[i_b]_{ss}=k_{ub}/k_b$ ] with a total concentration of collapsed intermediate state @xmath37+[i_b]$ ] , we obtain the rate of rnp formation at steady state : @xmath38 a change in the strength of binding between rna and protein cofactor would affect the values of @xmath39 by modulating @xmath40 or the stability of @xmath25 ensemble , while keeping other rate constants ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) unchanged ( the inset of fig.[fig : passive_rnp ] ) .    it can be argued that there be an optimal stability for @xmath25 in order to maximize the rate of rnp formation . if @xmath25 is too stable compared with @xmath43 then @xmath25 becomes a dead end with negligible probability of reshuffling its population into non - productive ensemble of @xmath28 into @xmath27 through conformational fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath43 is more stable than @xmath25 the production of competent rnp would be inefficient .",
    "it is clear from eq.[eqn : rss ] that the limiting condition of @xmath44 , either @xmath45 or @xmath46 , leads to a vanishing value of @xmath47 ; hence it follows that there is an optimum value @xmath48 that maximizes the rate of rnp production .",

    ", rna chaperone promotes rna molecule to reach the functionally competent form by merely providing a suitable molecular interface on which rna could interact and anneal its conformation .",
    "physically , this situation is not that dissimilar to the role mini chaperone ( apical domain of groel ) plays in annealing certain non - stringent substrates @xcite .",
    "if sufficient yield of the folded rna is not realized on the time scale @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath57 ( the partition factor , @xmath0 , in the kpm is small ) , then a more active role including atp consumption is required to resolve the misfolded states . for kinetically trapped misfolded rna molecules , transient unfolding of misfolded elements by rna chaperones",
    "is needed to increase the yield of rna since it provides another chance for refolding into a functional state . in experiments involving cyt-18 and the dead - box protein cyt-19 on _ neurospora crassa _",

    "therefore , the iterative action of the rna chaperone results in the  annealing \" the ensemble of molecules that is kinetically trapped in a multitude of metastable states to reach _ equilibrium _ by assisting the system to overcome otherwise insurmountable high free energy barriers separating the cbas and the nba ( fig.3(a ) ) .",

    "it is also worth emphasizing that full conversion of atp hydrolysis free energy to mechanical work is not always realized .",
    "for some chaperones functioning through an active mechanism , conformational cycle of chaperone could remain futile due to inefficient coupling to the structures of the substrate molecules . as a result ,",
    "multiple rounds of chaperone cycle are often needed to convert one misfolded molecule to the folded state .",
    "the variation in the efficiency of free energy transduction from one specific molecular chaperone to the other should lead to a rescaling of the number of iterations @xmath81 to @xmath174 where @xmath175 is a machine - dependent efficiency of unwinding ( unfolding ) of the substrate in one chaperone cycle .",

    "<S> the theory outlined here shows , in accord with experiments , that in the steady state the native state does not form with unit probability .        </S>",
    "<S> since the ground breaking discovery of self - splicing catalytic activity of group i intron ribozymes @xcite numerous and growing list of cellular functions have been shown to be controlled by rna molecules @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these discoveries have made it important to determine how rna molecules fold @xcite , and sometimes switch conformations in response to environmental signals @xcite to execute a wide range of activities from regulation of transcription and translation to catalysis . at a first glance </S>",
    "<S> , it may appear that rna folding is simple because of the potential restriction that the four different are paired as demanded by the watson - crick ( wc ) rule . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are several factors that make rna folding considerably more difficult than the more thoroughly investigated protein folding problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of negative charge on the phosphate group of each nucleotide , participation of a large fraction of nucleotides in non wc base pairing @xcite , the nearly homopolymeric nature of purine and pyrimidine bases , and paucity of structural data are some of the reasons that render the prediction of rna structures and their folding challenging @xcite . despite these difficulties considerable </S>",
    "<S> progress has been made in understanding how large ribozymes fold _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these studies have shown that the folding landscape of rna is rugged consisting of many easily accessible competing basins of attraction ( cbas ) in addition to the native basin of attraction ( nba ) , which implies that the stability gap @xcite separating the cbas and the nba is modest relative to proteins . as a consequence of the rugged folding landscape , only a small fraction of initially unfolded molecules reaches the nba rapidly while the remaining fraction are kinetically trapped in a number of favorable alternative low energy misfolded cbas , as predicted by the kinetic partitioning mechanism ( kpm ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy barriers separating the cbas and the nba is often high . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the transitions times to the nba from the cbas could exceed biologically relevant time scale ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound for @xmath1 should be no greater than tens of minutes given the typical cell cycle time .    because of the modest stability gap even simple rna molecules could misfold at the secondary as well as tertiary structure levels . </S>",
    "<S> in structural terms , secondary structure rearrangements , which are observed in the folding of p5abc @xcite and riboswitches @xcite induced by metal ions and metabolites , respectively , are one cause of the high free energy barriers separating cbas and nba in rna . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy barrier associated with melting of @xmath2 base pairs is @xmath3 where @xmath4 , the free energy stabilizing a base pair , is @xmath5 @xmath6 kcal / mol / bp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the average length of a duplex in rna structure is estimated to be @xmath7 bp from the ratio of nucleotides participating in the duplex formation @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 @xcite is the average length of a single stranded chain in native rnas . using these estimates </S>",
    "<S> , we surmise that a typical free energy barrier associated with secondary structure rearrangement is @xmath10 @xmath11 kcal / mol ( @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 ) . by assuming that the prefactor for barrier crossing is @xmath151 @xmath16 @xcite the time scale for spontaneous melting of a hairpin stack could be as large as @xmath17 sec @xmath5 1 day ! indeed , several _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> experiments have shown that _ tettrahymena _ </S>",
    "<S> ribozyme does not reach the folded state with unit probability even after hundreds of minutes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sluggish rna folding kinetics _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> is reminiscent of that observed in glasses due to the presence of multiple metastable states ( cbas ) @xcite . because of trapping in long - lived cbas , it is practically impossible for a large ribozyme to spontaneously make a transition to the native state with substantial probability within @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these considerations suggest _ in vivo _ folding would require rna chaperones @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this paper is to produce a quantitative framework for understanding the function of rna chaperones , which are protein cofactors that interact with the conformations in the cbas and facilitate their folding . </S>",
    "<S> we classify rna chaperones as passive and active . </S>",
    "<S> passive chaperones transiently interact with rna molecules and reduce the entropy barrier to folding without requiring an energy source . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> active chaperones function most efficiently by lavish consumption of atp in the presence of dead - box proteins . </S>",
    "<S> the need for passive or active chaperones depends on the client molecules and the extent of misfolding ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate a general kinetic model to describe both passive ( no atp required ) and active ( requires atp hydrolysis ) roles rna chaperones play in rescuing misfolded states . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting theory accounts for experimental observations , and should be useful in quantitatively analyzing future experiments . </S>"
