    "the analysis of self - organizing systems is also motivated by their frequent occurrence in nature . among others , so appears in hydrodynamic instabilities @xcite , concentration patterns during chemical reactions @xcite , as well as biological evolution and cellular processes @xcite .",
    "self - organizing systems ( soss ) also find various applications such as in the production of supramolecular structures @xcite , self - organization of organic semiconductors @xcite , and producing structured surfaces @xcite .",
    "while there is extensive work addressing the characteristics and dynamics of single soss , there is comparably little work on coupled processes . in a similar fashion as the interaction of the components of a single sos lead to the macroscopic coherent behavior of the sos itself , the communication between these systems may result in a nontrivial collective behavior as well .",
    "so far , to the best of our knowledge , such an analysis has only been performed for so chemical reactions .",
    "specifically , both theoretical and experimental work has been done for the coupling of chemical oscillators @xcite and extensively for turing instabilities .",
    "the latter occur in a two - component reaction - diffusion system used as a model system for pattern forming reactions @xcite . in the work of yang et al .",
    "@xcite , two separated liquid films were theoretically analyzed , where the same two - component chemical reaction was taking place in each film .",
    "the time dependence of the concentrations was described with the equations proposed by turing .",
    "the coupling between the layers was achieved by allowing one of the reactants to diffuse through the membrane separating the liquids .",
    "the numerical analysis of this system predicted the emergence of oscillatory patterns , which do not appear in the single - layer configuration .",
    "however , the turing equations are inappropriate for the complete description of a nonequilibrium system in steady state , since the need for constant supply of reactants and removal of products is not considered @xcite .",
    "moreover , the emergence of the patterns requires the two reactants to have considerably different diffusion coefficients @xcite . despite the difficulties , coupled turing patterns have been experimentally analyzed , and the emergence of superlattice patterns was observed @xcite .",
    "hence , for the turing instability it is confirmed that the coupled system has properties significantly different from the individual sos .",
    "this motivates the search for the effects of coupling in other physical systems .    to this end , facilitated by the extensive literature on self - organization in thin liquid films , the coupling of a long - wavelength ( or deformational ) bnard - marangoni instability with a long - wavelength rayleigh - taylor instability",
    "is analyzed .",
    "research on instabilities in liquid layers is widespread : next to their importance in coating technologies , they are still rich in unresolved scientific questions , while their theoretical description can nevertheless be performed with the navier - stokes equations and other well - established transport equations . furthermore , both instabilities forming the basis of this article have been examined in detail by numerous authors @xcite .",
    "herein , the coupling between the layers is achieved by the modulation of heat transfer , while mechanical interaction , e.g. , by viscous forces , is negligibly small .",
    "the evolution of coupled liquid instabilities has already been examined @xcite . however , the purpose of these works was not to illuminate synergistic effects , as the coupling mechanisms were usually quite complicated and a clear separation into individual subsystems was not readily possible .",
    "by contrast , for the system under discussion in this article , the dynamics of the films can be described with qualitatively identical evolution equations , facilitating the examination of the effects induced by the coupling .",
    "as the evolution equations remain reasonably transparent , one can clearly distinguish the two self - organizing subsystems and immediately isolate the effects which are caused by the coupling alone .",
    "this section focuses on the evolution equation of the long - wavelength instability for a double - layer system .",

    "instability is dominant , for which the characteristic pattern wavelength @xmath3 is of the same order as @xmath0 , whereas the deformation of the interface is negligible . for the second type , the so - called long - wavelength or deformational bm - instability",
    ", @xmath3 is much larger than @xmath0 , and the interface undergoes significant deformation .",
    "experimentally , this mode of instability is more difficult to observe since the commonly observed short - wavelength mode needs to be suppressed by either a small value of @xmath0 @xcite or by using very viscous films such as polymer @xcite or metal melts @xcite .",
    "equivalently , depending on @xmath0 , there exist two types of buoyancy - driven instabilities in liquid films .",
    "of particular interest herein is the long - wavelength rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability @xcite . as will be described below and except for the sign of the buoyancy term , the evolution equations for the long - wavelength bm instability and the long - wavelength rt instability are qualitatively the same , if in the latter case the film is exposed to a transverse thermal gradient .",
