    "after more than twenty years from the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity , a comprehensive description of the cuprate materials is still lacking .",
    "one of the main concern is about the origin of the electron pairing , namely if it is due to electron - phonon coupling , like in the standard theory by bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) ,  @xcite or it can be explained by alternative mechanisms , based on the electronic interaction alone . from one side , though the isotope effect in cuprates ( if any ) is much smaller than the one observed in bcs superconductors , there are experiments suggesting a strong coupling between electrons and localized lattice vibrations .",
    "@xcite on the other side , besides a clear experimental outcome showing unusual behaviors in both metallic and superconducting phases , there is an increasing theoretical evidence that purely electronic models can indeed sustain a robust pairing , possibly leading to a high critical temperature .",
    "@xcite within the latter scenario , the minimal microscopic model to describe the low - energy physics has been proposed to be the hubbard model or its strong - coupling limit , namely the @xmath10 model , which includes an antiferromagnetic coupling between localized spins and a kinetic term for the hole motion .",
    "@xcite in this respect , anderson proposed that electron pairing could naturally emerge from doping a mott insulator , described by a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state , where the spins are coupled together forming a liquid of singlets .",
    "@xcite indeed , subsequent numerical calculations for the @xmath10 model ,  @xcite showed that , though the corresponding mott insulator ( described by the heisenberg model ) has magnetic order , the rvb wave function with d - wave symmetry in the electron pairing can be stabilized in a huge region of doping close to the half - filled insulator .",
    "these calculations have been improved by studying the accuracy of such a variational state , giving solid and convincing arguments for the existence of a superconducting phase in the @xmath10 model .",
    "@xcite however , other numerical techniques , like density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , provided some evidence that charge inhomogeneities can occur at particular filling concentrations .",
    "@xcite these stripes are probably enhanced by the strong anisotropic boundary conditions used in this approach and can be also found by allowing anisotropies in the hopping and in the super - exchange coupling .",
    "@xcite coming back to the projected rvb wave functions , it is worth mentioning that an approximate and simplified description of these states can be obtained by the renormalized mean - field theory ( rmft ) , the so - called `` plain vanilla '' approach .",
    "@xcite when this approach is applied to the @xmath11 model , it is possible to describe many unusual properties of the high - temperature superconductors and capture the most important aspects of the cuprate phase diagram .",
    "@xcite however , at present , most of the calculations have been done by neglecting antiferromagnetic correlations , that are definitively important at low doping . within rmft and most of the variational calculations ,",
    "the magnetic correlations are omitted , implying a spin liquid ( disordered ) state in the insulating regime .",
    "although antiferromagnetism can be easily introduced in both approaches , it is often not satisfactorily described , since the presence of an antiferromagnetic order parameter in the fermionic determinant implies a wrong behavior of the spin properties at small momenta ,  @xcite unless a spin jastrow factor is used to describe the corresponding spin - wave fluctuations .",
    "indeed , it is now well known that the accurate correlated description of an ordered state is obtained by applying a long - range spin jastrow factor to a state with magnetic order .",
    "@xcite the important point is that the gaussian fluctuations induced by the jastrow term must be orthogonal to the direction of the order parameter , in order to reproduce correctly the low - energy spin - wave excitations .",
    "moreover , by generalizing the variational wave function to consider pfaffians instead of simple determinants ,  @xcite it is possible to consider both electron pairing and magnetic order , that are definitively important to determine the phase diagram of the @xmath10 model in the low - doping regime .",
    "the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism is the subject of an intense investigation in the recent years . in",
    "most of the thermodynamic measurements these two kinds of order do not coexist , though elastic neutron scattering experiments for underdoped @xmath12 could suggest a possible coexistence , with a small staggered magnetization .",
    "@xcite on the contrary , in the @xmath10 model , there is an evidence in favor of a coexistence ,  @xcite the antiferromagnetic order surviving up to a relatively large hole doping , i.e. , @xmath13 for @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite therefore , the regime of magnetic order predicted by these calculations extend to much larger doping than the experimental results and also the robustness of the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism seems to be inconsistent with the experimental outcome .",
    "of course , disorder effects , which are expected to be important especially in the underdoped region , would affect the general phase diagram .",
    "@xcite however , without invoking disorder , one is also interested to understand if alternative ingredients can modify the phase diagram of the simple @xmath10 model .",
    "for instance , band structure calculations support the presence of a sizable second - neighbor hopping @xmath14 in cuprate materials , showing a possible connection between the value of the highest critical temperature and the ratio @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite moreover , an experimental analysis suggests an influence of the value of @xmath15 on the pseudogap energy scale .",
    "@xcite from a theoretical point of view , the effect of @xmath14 is still not completely elucidated ,  @xcite though there are different calculations providing evidence that a finite @xmath14 could suppress superconductivity in the low - doping regime . on the other hand ,",
    "recent monte carlo calculations suggest that the presence of @xmath14 ( as well as a third - neighbor hopping @xmath16 ) could induce an enhancement of pairing in optimal and overdoped regions .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we want to examine the problem of the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in the @xmath10 model and its extension including a next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath14 by using improved variational and green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) techniques .",
    "indeed , especially the latter approach has been demonstrated to be very efficient in projecting out a very accurate approximation of the exact ground state and , therefore , can give useful insight into this important issue related to high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we describe the methods we used , in sec .",
    "[ results ] we show the numerical results for antiferromagnetism and superconductivity , and in sec .",
    "[ conc ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 model on a two - dimensional square lattice with @xmath17 sites and periodic boundary conditions on both directions : @xmath18 where @xmath19 indicates the nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath20 the next - nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron with spin @xmath23 on the site @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the spin operator , @xmath26 , being @xmath27 the pauli matrices , and @xmath28 is the local density operator . in the following , we set @xmath29 and consider @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , we consider two kinds of square clusters : standard clusters with @xmath30 sites and @xmath31 tilted lattices with @xmath32 sites . besides translational symmetries , both of them have all reflection and rotational symmetries .",
    "the variational wave function is defined by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gutzwiller projector that forbids double occupied sites , @xmath35 is the projector onto the subspace with fixed number of @xmath36 particles .",
    "moreover , @xmath37 is a spin jastrow factor @xmath38 being @xmath39 variational parameters , and finally @xmath40 is a density jastrow factor @xmath41 being @xmath42 other variational parameters .",
    "the above wave function can be efficiently sampled by standard variational monte carlo , by employing a random walk of a configuration @xmath43 , defined by the electron positions and their spin components along the @xmath44 quantization axis .",
    "indeed , in this case , both jastrow terms are very simple to compute , since they only represent classical weights acting on the configuration .",
    "as previously reported ,  @xcite the main difference from previous approaches is the presence of the spin jastrow factor and the choice of the mean - field state @xmath45 , defined as the ground state of the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath46 where we include both bcs pairing @xmath47 [ with @xmath48-wave symmetry , i.e. , for nearest - neighbor sites @xmath49 and staggered magnetic field in the @xmath50 plane @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a variational parameter that , together with the chemical potential @xmath53 and the next - nearest - neighbor hopping of eq .",
    "( [ meanfield ] ) , can be determined by minimizing the variational energy of @xmath54 .",
    "whenever both @xmath55 and @xmath52 are finite , the projection @xmath56 of the mean - field state on a given configuration @xmath43 can be described in terms of pfaffians , instead if @xmath57 or @xmath58 it can be described by using determinants . moreover , only in the case where the magnetic order parameter is in the @xmath50 plane , the presence of the spin jastrow factor  ( [ spinjastrow ] ) can introduce relevant fluctuations over the mean - field order parameter @xmath52 , leading to an accurate description of the spin properties . a detailed description of the wave function of eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) and its physical properties can be found in ref .  .",
    "the variational parameters contained in the mean - field hamiltonian  ( [ meanfield ] ) and in the jastrow factors  ( [ spinjastrow ] ) and  ( [ densityjastrow ] ) are calculated by using the optimization technique described in ref .  , that makes it possible to handle with a rather large number of variational parameters .",
    "the optimized variational wave function @xmath59 can be also used within the gfmc method to filter out an approximation of the ground state @xmath60 .",
    "indeed , due to the presence of the fermionic sign problem , in order to have a stable numerical calculation , the gfmc must be implemented within the fixed - node ( fn ) approach , that imposes to @xmath60 to have the same nodal structure of the variational ansatz .",
    "@xcite here , we recall the basic definitions of the standard fn method . a detailed description of this technique can be found in ref .  .",
    "starting from the original hamiltonian @xmath54 , we define an effective model by @xmath61 the operator @xmath62 is defined through its matrix elements and depends upon a given _ guiding _",
    "function @xmath63 , that is for instance the variational state itself , i.e. , @xmath59 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath43 being an electron configuration with definite @xmath44-component of the spin .",
    "notice that the above operator annihilates the guiding function , namely @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , whenever the guiding function is close to the exact ground state of @xmath54 , the perturbation @xmath62 is expected to be small and the effective hamiltonian becomes very close to the original one .",
    "the most important property of this effective hamiltonian is that its ground state @xmath60 can be efficiently computed by using gfmc .",
    "@xcite the distribution @xmath67 is sampled by means of a statistical implementation of the power method : @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a starting distribution and @xmath70 , is the so - called green s function , @xmath71 being the kronecker symbol .",
    "the statistical method is very efficient since all the matrix elements of @xmath72 are non - negative and , therefore , @xmath72 can represent a transition probability in configuration space , apart for a normalization factor @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath60 is an exact eigenstate of the effective hamiltonian @xmath74 , the corresponding ground - state energy can be evaluated efficiently by computing @xmath75 namely the statistical average of the local energy @xmath76 over the distribution @xmath77 . the quantity @xmath78 because , by the variational principle @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , @xmath80 represents an upper bound of the expectation value @xmath81 of @xmath54 over @xmath60 , as it is shown in ref .   or it can be simply derived by considering that the operator @xmath62 is semi - positive definite , namely all its eigenvalues are non - negative . in the following , we will denote by fn the ( variational ) results obtained by using the gfmc method with fixed - node approximation , whereas the standard variational monte carlo results obtained by considering the wave function of eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) will be denoted by vmc .",
    "summarizing the fn approach is a more general and powerful variational method than the straightforward variational monte carlo . within the fn method ,",
    "the wave function @xmath60 , the ground state of @xmath82 is known only statistically , and , just as in the variational approach , @xmath81 depends explicitly on the variational parameters defining the guiding function @xmath63 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath74 depends upon @xmath63 through the operator @xmath62 .",
    "the main advantage of the fn approach is that it provides the exact ground - state wave function for the undoped insulator ( where the signs of the exact ground state are known ) , and therefore it is expected to be particularly accurate in the important low - doping region .",
    "moreover , the fn method is known to be very efficient in various cases : for instance , it has allowed to obtain a basically exact description of the three - dimensional system of electrons interacting through the realistic coulomb potential ( in presence of a uniform positive background ) .",
    "@xcite therefore , it represents a very powerful tool to describe correlated electronic systems .",
    "before showing the results on magnetic and superconducting properties , we briefly discuss the stability against phase separation . in order to detect a possible phase separation ,",
    "it is very useful to follow the criterion given in ref .   and consider the energy per hole : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the energy per site at hole doping @xmath85 and @xmath86 is its value at half filling . in practice",
    ", @xmath87 represents the chord joining the energy per site at half filling and the one at doping @xmath85 . for a stable system , @xmath87 must be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath85 , because the ground - state energy of a short - range hamiltonian is a convex function of the doping . by performing exact energy calculations on finite clusters ,",
    "the phase separation instability is marked by a minimum of @xmath87 at a given @xmath88 and by a flat behavior up to @xmath88 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "for an approximate variational technique based on a spatially homogeneous ansatz , this flat behavior is never reached in the phase separated region , so that @xmath87 remains with a well defined minimum even for very large sizes ; in this case , @xmath88 can be estimated with the maxwell construction , provided the variational asnatz is accurate enough . in ref .",
    ", we demonstrated the existence of an homogeneous state for @xmath1 and @xmath89 .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab1 ] , the fn approximation , that is exact at zero doping ,  @xcite provides a substantial lowering of the vmc energy , especially away from half filling and for a finite @xmath14 .",
    "this is a first indication that , for @xmath90 , the simple variational approach could not be adequate to provide a reliable quantitative description of the ground - state properties .",
    "the fn results clearly indicate that the inclusion of a negative next - nearest - neighbor hopping contributes to further stabilize the homogeneous phase at finite doping , see fig .",
    "[ fig : emery ] .",
    "this result is compatible with the outcome of recent calculations based on cluster dynamical mean - field theory on the hubbard model , where a negative ratio @xmath15 enhances the stability of the homogeneous phase , whereas positive values of @xmath14 favor phase separation .",

    "it turns out that at half - filling and in the low - doping regime , the variational state  ( [ wf ] ) has an antiferromagnetic order in the @xmath50 plane , whereas the spin - spin correlations in the @xmath44 axis decay very rapidly .",
    "therefore , in order to assess the magnetic order at the variational level , we have to consider the isotropic spin - spin correlations : @xmath96 the fn approach alleviates the anisotropy between the @xmath50 plane and the @xmath44 axis ; in this case , we find that a rather accurate ( and much less computational expensive ) way to estimate the magnetic moment can be obtained from the @xmath44 component of the spin - spin correlations : @xmath97 this quantity can be easily computed within the forward - walking technique ,  @xcite because the operator @xmath98 is diagonal in the basis of configurations used in the monte carlo sampling . from the spin - spin correlations at the maximum distance , it is possible to extract the value of the magnetization . in particular , the variational wave function is",

    "moreover , though the fn approach is able to recover an exact singlet state at half filling , @xmath115 increases by doping , reaching its maximum around @xmath116 , e.g. , @xmath117 for @xmath118 holes on @xmath92 sites .",
    "this could explain why the fn results are a bit larger than the vmc ones for @xmath116 , especially for @xmath3 .",
    "definitively , both the vmc and fn wave functions are almost spin singlets close to the transition point , because the mean - field order parameter @xmath52 goes to zero together with the parameters defining the spin jastrow factor .",

    "indeed , the variational results , based on the simple wave function with bcs pairing and the on - site gutzwiller projector ( but without the long - range jastrow factors ) overestimate the pairing correlations at optimal doping by at least a factor two . remarkably , the fn approach is able to correct this bias , providing approximately the same results as the one obtained starting from the wave function with the long - range jastrow factor , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pair ] .",
    "this fact shows that the fn method is particularly reliable for estimating the pairing correlations .",
    "the inclusion of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping induces sizable modifications in the pairing correlations , though the qualitative dome - like behavior remains unchanged , see fig .  [",
    "fig : pairtprime ] . at low doping",
    "there is a sizable suppression of the superconducting pairing , particularly evident after the fn projection , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pairlow ] . indeed , while for the pure @xmath10 model we clearly obtain a linear behavior of the pair - pair correlations with @xmath85 ,  @xcite indicating a superconducting phase as soon as the mott insulator is doped , in the case of a finite @xmath14 , the fn results could be compatible with a finite critical doping , below which the system is not superconducting .",
    "this outcome is in agreement with earlier monte carlo calculations done by one of us ,  @xcite where it was suggested that the extended @xmath10 model with hoppings and super - exchange interactions derived from structural data of the @xmath149 compound could explain the main experimental features of high - temperature superconducting materials , with a finite critical doping for the onset of electron pairing .",
    "( color online ) detail of the pair - pair correlations reported in figs .",
    "[ fig : pair ] and  [ fig : pairtprime ] at low doping.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     size scaling of the pair - pair correlations at the maximum distance for @xmath0 model with @xmath3 and @xmath8 at @xmath150.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    remarkably , from @xmath13 to @xmath148 there are huge size effects .",
    "though , for @xmath150 , small clusters , e.g. , @xmath91 , indicate stronger pairing correlations than the pure @xmath10 model without @xmath14 , larger clusters point out a large reduction of @xmath151 .",
    "nonetheless , we have a rather clear evidence that for @xmath150 there is a finite superconducting order parameter in the thermodynamic limit , see fig .  [",
    "fig : scalingpd ] .",
    "this strong reduction of the superconducting correlations is a very interesting effect , demonstrating that the superconducting wave function ( even if supplemented by magnetic order ) deteriorates its accuracy by increasing the value of @xmath14 , that could eventually stabilize competing phases with modulation in the charge distribution and/or a magnetic flux through the plaquettes .",
    "@xcite however , for @xmath8 , the homogenous variational ansatz  ( [ wf ] ) provides a lower energy when compared to the one used in ref .  .",
    "@xcite at present , the most accurate fn calculations based on the lowest - energy variational ansatz , do not show any tendency towards charge inhomogeneities for @xmath152 .",
    "this outcome is important because in principle the fn approach can spontaneously induce charge - density wave modulations in the ground state , even when the variational wave function before the fn projection is translationally invariant .",
    "in this paper , we considered the magnetic and superconducting properties of the @xmath0 model within vmc and fn approaches .",
    "we showed that for @xmath1 the ground - state properties can be accurately reproduced by a state containing both electron pairing and suitable magnetic correlations , namely a magnetic order parameter in the mean - field hamiltonian that defines the fermionic determinant and a spin jastrow factor for describing the spin fluctuations . in this case , we obtain a rather large magnetic phase , with a critical doping that slightly depends upon the super - exchange coupling @xmath129 , i.e. , @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath3 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the superconducting correlations show a dome - like behavior and vanish when the mott insulator at half filling is approached .",
    "interestingly , compared to the rmft that predicts a quadratic behavior of the pair - pair correlations as a function of the doping @xmath85 , here we found that a linear behavior is more plausible .",
    "then , we also reported important modifications due to the presence of a finite ratio @xmath15 .",
    "the first effect of this further hopping term is to strongly suppress antiferromagnetic correlations at low doping , shifting the critical doping to @xmath153 for @xmath8 .",
    "this is a genuine effect of the fn method , since , within the pure variational approach , though the spin - spin correlations are suppressed with respect to the case of @xmath1 , the values of the critical doping for these two cases are very similar .",
    "most importantly , the presence of a finite value of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping has dramatic effects on the superconducting properties .",
    "at small doping , i.e. , @xmath154 there is a sizable suppression of the electronic pairing , possibly pointing toward a metallic phase in the slightly doped regime , as previously suggested by using improved monte carlo techniques .",
    "@xcite moreover , for @xmath155 , though small lattices seem to indicate an increasing of superconductivity compared to the pure @xmath10 model , larger clusters show huge size effects that strongly renormalize the pairing correlations at large distance .",
    "however , for the value of @xmath14 considered in this work , we are rather confident that superconducting off - diagonal long - range order takes place in a considerable hole region . in any case , the huge renormalization of the electronic pairing for @xmath150 , together with the fact that the fn results are very different from the vmc ones based on a wave function containing pairing ( and magnetic order at low doping ) , suggests the possibility of the existence of a non - superconducting phase ( with magnetic fluxes and/or charge order ) that could be eventually stabilized by further increasing the ratio @xmath15 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the main qualitative features of the cuprate phase diagram appear rather well reproduced by the @xmath0 model with a sizable next - nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "however , we do not find a sizable enhancement of the pairing correlations by increasing the ratio @xmath15 , that looks in contradiction with the empirical relation between @xmath15 and the value of @xmath156 .",
    "@xcite however , we have to remark that we only considered ground - state properties and we can not evaluate @xmath156 , whose relation with the pairing correlations may be highly non trivial , especially in a strongly - correlated system , like the @xmath10 model .",
    "this issue certainly deserves further work .",
