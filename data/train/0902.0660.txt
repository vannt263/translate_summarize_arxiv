    "there has been growing observational evidence indicating that our universe has entered the epoch of accelerated expansion @xcite . within the framework of einstein gravity",
    ", this acceleration can be attributed to the so called dark energy ( de ) with negative pressure , which dominates the content of universe at present .",
    "the leading interpretation of such de is a cosmological constant with equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 @xcite . though the cosmological constant is consistent with the observation data , at the fundamental level it fails to be convinced : the vacuum energy density falls far below the value predicted by any sensible quantum field theory by many orders of magnitude , and it unavoidably leads to the coincidence problem , i.e. ,",
    " why are the vacuum and matter energy densities of precisely the same order today ? \" .",
    "more sophisticated models have been proposed to replace the cosmological constant by a dynamical dark energy in the conjectures relating the de either to a scalar field called quintessence with @xmath1 , or to an exotic field called phantom with @xmath2 .",
    "it would be fair to say that there is no clear winner in sight to explain the nature of de at the moment .",
    "on the other hand , the remarkable discovery of the cosmic acceleration might also be doubted as the result of a modification of standard einstein gravity at large distances .",
    "this happens in @xmath3 theories @xcite and in braneworld models@xcite .",
    "how to distinguish such modified gravity theory from that of de is an imperative task which will bring about not only a breakthrough in cosmology , but also in the field of high energy physics .",
    "the de is usually not supposed to clump on the scales of the largest cosmic structures , and the most powerful way where its nature can be unveiled is to investigate the expansion history of universe@xcite .",
    "however , the current observations of cosmic expansion history can not break the degeneracies among different approaches trying to explain the cosmic acceleration . considering that the rate of expansion as a function of cosmic time can in turn affect the process of structure formation ,",
    "an alternative channel to study the clustering properties of cosmic structure has been used to detect the possible effects of de .",
    "it is expected that the growth history of dark matter ( dm ) perturbations can provide a complementary probe to distinguish the modified gravity from de@xcite .",
    "however , most of these studies have neglected the effect of de perturbations .",
    "the de perturbations do not affect the background evolution , but they are crucial in determining the de clustering properties@xcite , which consequently have effects on the evolution of dm perturbations .",
    "recently it has been found that for small sound speed and de eos prominently away from @xmath4 , the presence of de perturbations may leave a significant imprint on the growth function of dm perturbations@xcite .    in the minimal picture , dm does not feel any significant interactions from de .",
    "although this picture is consistent with current observations , considering that de accounts for a large fraction of the universe , it is natural , in the framework of field theory , to consider its interaction with the remaining fields in the universe .",
    "the possibility that de and dm can interact has been widely discussed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the coupling between de and dm can provide a mechanism to alleviate the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been argued that an appropriate interaction between de and dm can influence the perturbation dynamics and affect the lowest multipoles of the cmb angular power spectrum @xcite .",
    "furthermore it was suggested that the dynamical equilibrium of collapsed structures such as clusters would be modified due to the coupling between de and dm @xcite . in the presence of such coupling , there has been some concerns about the stability of the perturbations @xcite .",
    "however , it was proved in @xcite that the stability of the curvature perturbation depends on the forms of coupling between dark sectors . since observational signatures on the dark sectors mutual interaction",
    "have been found in the probes of the cosmic expansion history @xcite , it is interesting to ask whether the interaction can have an effect on the growth of structure , whether it can provide a more consistent check for the coupling between dark sectors .    in this paper",
    "we are going to study the effect of the interaction between de and dm on the growth function of dm perturbations .",
    "recently there is an attempt on this study@xcite . here",
    "we will incorporate the de perturbations in our study .",
    "we will restrict our investigation to constant sound speed as well as constant eos of de . from our formalism",
    "we will see that the growth of dm perturbations gets more modification due to the dark sectors interaction than that of the de perturbations .",
    "this provides an opportunity to probe the interaction between de and dm through the growth history of dm .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the following section we will provide our analytical framework for the perturbation equations at the linear level . in sec.iii",

    "<S> = 0.6 cm    we present a general formalism to study the growth of dark matter perturbations when dark energy perturbations and interactions between dark sectors are present . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dynamical stability on the growth of structure depends on the form of coupling between dark sectors . by taking the appropriate coupling which enables the stable growth of structure , we find that the effect of the interaction between dark sectors overwhelms that of dark energy perturbation on the growth of dark matter perturbation . due to the influence of the interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the growth index can differ from the value without interaction by an amount up to the observational sensibility , which provides an opportunity to probe the interaction between dark sectors through future observations on the growth of structure .    </S>",
