    "the window of observational astronomy has become broader , firstly in the 70s with the development of the first gravitational wave detectors , then in the 90s with the birth of the astroparticle field and the construction of neutrinos telescope . on the other hand , the charged particles , produced abundantly in all astrophysical sources , lose the direction of the source , due to diffusion inside galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) .",
    "however , one hope is to use the highest part of the cosmic ray spectrum , to open a new window in astrophysics . to do this",
    ", we must find a path connecting the two fundamental ingredients : the ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) and the extra - galactic magnetic field ( egmf ) .",
    "the existence of a @xmath2 g gmf was discovered by @xcite .",
    "egmf of @xmath3 g were detected by both synchrotron emission and faraday rotation in the coma cluster . beyond clusters , in sparser regions , surprising magnetic fields of @xmath4 g",
    "were measured @xcite .",
    "observations suggest that magnetic fields are present in all galaxies and clusters .",
    "even if they are small , they are extended on very large scale and the energy inside could be very huge .",
    "more details are in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the importance of magnetic field is well known in the case of radio galaxies where the radio lobes confirm the existence of a large magnetized region well outside the galaxy .",
    "@xcite advanced the idea that the gmf , especially in the case of radio galaxies , is a consequence of the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center . following this , and using the fact that most probably all galaxies have a massive black hole in their center",
    ", we will assume that the existence of the galactic magnetic halo is a general property of galaxies .",
    "this has to be modulated by the value of the related field and the size of this halo .",
    "there is also evidence for the existence of the magnetic halo in the case of spiral galaxy seen edge - on @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the problem of the uhecr origin is a long standing mystery , starting with the discovery of a @xmath5  ev event @xcite that opened the pandora s box .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields play a vital role in this puzzle , and are a corner stone for the uhecr propagation .",
    "the gyroradius @xmath6 of a proton of energy @xmath7 in a magnetic field @xmath1 is given by @xmath8 .",
    "the influence of cosmic rays propagation has been underlined in several articles . @xcite scrutinized the influence of gmf and they showed that protons in the range of @xmath9  ev can probe the large scale structure of gmf .",
    "@xcite made a study of the influence of the gmf , including a magnetic galactic halo in form of dipole given by @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the effect of large egmf localized in sheets and filaments , while voids are kept almost free of magnetic field .",
    "he showed that this assumption has dramatic consequences on the cosmic ray propagation .",
    "@xcite analyzed the influence of egmf and showed that for strongly magnetized regions , observers predict considerable large scale anisotropies between @xmath10  ev and @xmath5  ev .",
    "@xcite presented numerical uhecr simulations in a structured intergalactic magnetic field given by iras pscz catalog .",
    "they estimated the number of sources to explain the agasa data observations and found that @xmath11  mpc@xmath12 is the best number of uhecr sources density .",
    "@xcite examined the uhecr propagation using simulations of large - scale structure formation to study the build - up magnetic field in the intergalactic magnetic medium .",
    "they constructed full - sky maps of expected uhe protons deflections .",
    "cosmic rays propagation in the galaxy is strongly affected by the gmf , where the gyroradius of a proton can be as small as @xmath13  pc .",
    "therefore , for @xmath14 ev , cosmic rays diffuse in the gmf .",
    "they get isotropized and hence do not reveal the sources where they were accelerated . in the range",
    "@xmath9 ev , cosmic rays through the magnetic fields are thought to change from heavy to light in composition and from diffusive to ballistic in propagation @xcite .",
    "to study uhecr propagation we need the full map of the magnetic field .",
    "the source of this field relies on three different origins : the galactic one which is well known and for which we have an analytical expression ; the extragalactic one , in main part completely unknown , and for which a lot of numerical simulations has been made using large scale structure formation ; finally the effect of the field of the galaxies encountered by uhecr .",
    "it has long been hypothesized that the deviation by these galaxies are unlikely or inefficient .",
    "since we have now a complete view of our local universe ( up to 120  mpc ) , thanks to many surveys , it is interesting to evaluate quantitatively this contribution . in this article",
    "we reconsider this hypothesis in light of a complete galaxy catalog . lacking general data on magnetic halos for all the galaxies in the survey , we assume this is a general property and apply to each galaxy a model similar to the milky way .    in sec .",
    "[ deux ] we detail the way to reconstruct the nearby universe magnetic fields . in sec .",
    "[ trois ] we present the code used to retro - propagate the charged particles , here assumed to be protons , and the results of simulation in the virgo cluster and maps of agasa data , with particular attention to the triplet . in sec .",
    "[ conc ] we finally show that such deviations are not negligible and are to be incorporated in propagation calculations .",
    "to study uhecr propagation in the local universe , we looked at the most complete galaxy map available .",
    "recently , @xcite published a complete galaxy catalog by merging several catalogs .",
    "leda ( lyon - meudon extragalactic database ) is a collection of near infrared properties of galaxies , using full resolution images from denis measurement survey .",
    "this leads to a catalog of 753153 galaxies with i , j , l , k magnitudes . from this catalog",
    ", we extracted a sample of 60130 galaxies within 120  mpc from us .",
    "we selected the galaxies for which we have a distance estimator in the catalog .",
    "leda permits also to have the inclination parameter of the galaxy axis as well as several other features",
    ".    we will use this sample to construct a magnetic map . lacking direct measurement of magnetic field of large sample of galaxies",
    ", we will assume a simple model for it : each galaxy is surrounded by a magnetic halo with a dipole structure .",
    "the halo dipole magnetic field ( hdf ) is , in spherical coordinates , @xmath15 where @xmath16  @xmath17 g  kpc@xmath18 is the galactic magnetic moment and @xmath6 is the distance from galactic center .",
    "these values are the same of milky way @xcite .",
    "the inner zone ( @xmath19  pc ) is taken as a constant value @xmath20  mg . the magnetic field is considered unimportant for @xmath21  kpc , where it falls below @xmath22  ng and is set to zero .",
    "for this value , the larmor radius of a @xmath5 ev proton is @xmath23  gpc .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic dipole @xmath24-axis is chosen with a random number , but is parallel to symmetry axis for elliptic galaxies or rotation axis for spiral ones .    according to @xcite , the average cosmic ray density in the milky way",
    "is @xmath25 ev  cm@xmath12 .",
    "the total magnetic energy stored inside this halo is @xmath27  ergs , which is less than the total energy inside cosmic rays estimated as the value @xmath28  ergs for a normal galaxy .",
    "therefore the @xmath1 value in this assumption is conservative and it is much less than the equipartition one , which is reasonable for structured fields . by comparison , under the assumption that the field was adiabatically compressed , @xcite found that the intergalactic magnetic field should be at @xmath29  ng , while we are at @xmath22  ng at the halo edge .",
    "we computed the average value of the magnetic field inside a box of 40  mpc centered on our galaxy .",
    "the numerical integration gives @xmath30  ng .",
    "it is compatible with faraday rotation measurements of high @xmath24 radio loud qso @xcite . by comparison",
    ", @xcite found an average value @xmath31  ng with coherence lengths @xmath32  mpc in the strong field regions .",
    "to explain such magnetized halo , we follow the arguments proposed by @xcite regarding giant radio galaxies ( grg ) . analyzing grg",
    ", they concluded that a large fraction of energy is stored in extended radio source in form of magnetic energy .",
    "they noticed that , contrary to the case of radiation energy , which is quickly lost , magnetic energy gets confined for a significant fraction of cosmic time .",
    "they assumed that gravitational energy lies at the origin of this magnetized energy and proposed a new link between massive black holes and the magnetized universe .",
    "since we have now solid indications that massive black holes are a common feature of all galaxies , we can extend the argument developed by @xcite to all galaxies : at some level the energy exchanges between gravitational and magnetic energy , through the presence of a massive black hole .",
    "the natural conclusion is that massive black holes are at the origin of magnetized galaxies . in the case of agn",
    ", the presence of magnetism is unveiled by the radio lobes . in case of less active galaxies",
    ", it could be associated to a less extended lobe , like a magnetized halo .",
    "our assumption is then fully justified in this new scenario .",
    "in our simulation we used the agasa data @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we superimposed the agasa events and the corresponding events after the interaction with gmf according to the bss - a model given by @xcite .",
    "the simulation shows clearly a gmf effect . the maximum deviation is related to region of high density of matter where @xmath1 is stronger .",
    "the results were checked for all the directions in the sky and were consistent with @xcite .",
    "then we focused on two regions of the sky .",
    "the first is virgo cluster where the mean galaxy concentration is twice the density background @xcite .",
    "we inject 10000 monochromatic protons distributed in a cone half angle @xmath33 centered at @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and study the backward propagation by numerical integration of the equation of motion .",
    "the integration step is variable , depending on magnetic field intensity , but @xmath36  kpc .",
    "the lorentz equation depends on the ratio @xmath37 , so we adapted the steps as a function of the value of @xmath38 in order to conserve the accuracy of numerical solution .",
    "the magnetic field is neglected when @xmath39  ng . excluding the milky way contribution , the mean deflection due to hdf is @xmath40 at 30  mpc for a proton of energy @xmath41 . the result is given on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . adding the gmf contribution",
    ", we obtain a global deviation of @xmath42 .",
    "to evaluate the influence of the field amplitude , we made another simulation with a field frozen at 1  ng up to 300  kpc from the galaxy center ( a _ frozen halo _ ) .",
    "the results are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig3ab ] : even in the pure dipole approach we have some points at large angular deviation ; while , for a larger magnetic field , the spot itself is spread by multiple deviations .",
    "the effect of possible deviations by galaxies between us and the source of uhecr could not be negligible .",
    "the second region corresponds to the agasa triplet , whose center is located in the galactic coordinates ( @xmath43 ; @xmath44 ) where the galaxies density is low .",
    "using our propagation code , with both gmf and hdf contribution , we launched 40000 trajectories for each of the triplet points , with the agasa energy .",
    "we found that there is a small but important dispersion .",
    "looking back to the trajectories we identified some common origin for the agasa triplet ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . among the possible sources for the triplet we have isolated ngc3998 and ngc3992 which are at a distance of @xmath45 25  mpc .",
    "at least one trajectory for each triplet event passes through these galaxies .",
    "ngc3998 is a liner type i and it has been recently observed by xmm - newton @xcite .",
    "several observations show an increase of x - ray flux , characteristic of an intense activity .",
    "they concluded that a jet model may be consistent with the radio and x - ray flux and jet emission may produce also the mid - ir and optical / uv flux . if we follow this conclusion , we can assume the existence of a jet and presumably a shock wave at the end of this jet . in this environment",
    "we expect to have uhecr acceleration @xcite .",
    "we naturally propose ngc3998 as a solid candidate to be the agasa triplet source .",
    "ngc3992 is a giant luminous spiral galaxy located inside a galaxy group with a large mass to light ratio .",
    "historically this is a known galaxy ( m101 ) , and hosted a supernova type i @xcite .",
    "it is interesting in light of the observed connection between supernovae and gamma - ray bursts , which are likely transient uhecr sources @xcite .",
    "we developed a uhecr propagation code through the magnetic field constructed with the 60130 galaxies within 120  mpc from leda catalog . in the simulations we assumed that uhecr are protons . using agasa data we found evidence for deviation that could affect the direction of the source . in the conservative approach",
    "the mean deviation we obtained is close to the one obtained by @xcite by studying the cosmic rays propagation in the extragalactic magnetic field using the large scale structure ( lss ) formation .",
    "our result shows that the magnetic deviation by galaxies is not negligible .",
    "in fact , to do charged particle astronomy , we certainly should consider the granularity effect of our local universe and also the deviation associated . in that sense",
    "our work is a step further and complementary to the work using lss simulations of @xcite .",
    "the results are model dependent and our main objective is to demonstrate the influence of galactic magnetic halos on uhecr propagation .",
    "we want to underline that we used a conservative approach : first , in the choice of the b field we took a dipole component with an edge value of the halo of @xmath46  ng ; second , in our simulation we focused on protons at energy @xmath47  ev . heavier or less energetic particles are more deviated .",
    "despite all this , our work shows clearly that the influence of hdf is not negligible .",
    "a next step will be to incorporate in the code the influence of the cluster and the intergalactic magnetic fields , which has been partially done in fig .",
    "[ fig3ab ] . in the case of the agasa triplet ,",
    "our results suggest two candidates by tracing back the deflected trajectories .",
    "ngc3998 presents some astrophysical interest : it is an active galaxy at relatively short distance .",
    "therefore we suggest it as a possible uhecr source .",
    "the scenario presented here is related to the galactic magnetic halo and answers to the fundamental question of the relation between magnetism and structure formation .",
    "this question is addressed from the theoretical part with some possible connection between supermassive black holes and magnetism , as in kronberg scenario .",
    "the ska and lofar survey will surely clarify the picture by mapping the magnetic fields with more accuracy .",
    "uhecr propagation could give us another astrophysical test of this connection .",
    "we would like to thank g. paturel and p. prugniel for valuable discussions .",
    "we are also grateful to the cc - in2p3 at lyon for technical support in computing .",
