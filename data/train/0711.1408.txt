    "pairing correlations are of special importance for many - fermion systems such as electrons in superconducting metals , nucleons in the nucleus , and quarks in color superconductivity .",
    "the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory @xcite of superconductivity has successfully described the sharp superfluid - to - normal phase transition connected to the breakdown of pairing correlations for an infinite fermi system .",
    "such a second - order phase transition is characterized by a discontinuity of the second derivative of the partition function with respect to some order parameter , e.g. , in the present case , a jump of the heat capacity at a critical temperature . for finite fermi systems , however , recent theoretical approaches @xcite demonstrate that thermal and quantal fluctuations are important ; they wash out the discontinuity of the heat capacity which is obtained in the bcs approximation , and instead produce a continuous @xmath3-shape around the critical temperature .",
    "such an @xmath3-shape has been found experimentally by the oslo group @xcite , and interpreted as a signature of the pairing phase transition .",
    "another fingerprint of this transition is the local decrease of thermal odd - even mass differences @xcite extracted from the observed level densities of a triplet of isotopes with neutron number @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , which yields a temperature corresponding to the one obtained from the @xmath3 shape of the heat capacity curve .    in finite fermi systems such as nuclei , the bcs theory alone fails to provide a good approximation of thermal properties .",
    "this comes because particle number is not a good quantum number in the bcs description of the superfluid phase .",
    "indeed , a bcs treatment with rigorous number projection @xcite such as the variation after projection ( vap ) method @xcite smooths out the sharp phase transition and hence gives a more realistic picture , while the discontinuity in the heat capacity remains in , e.g. , the projection after variation ( pav ) method @xcite .",
    "exact number projection is also essential for an accurate description of odd - even effects seen in the heat - capacity curves of small superfluid systems .",
    "it is therefore desirable to investigate how the number projection affects thermal properties such as the @xmath3 shape in heat capacity of nuclei @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been recently demonstrated @xcite , that particle - number projection within the bcs theory by the pav scheme can produce an @xmath3-shaped heat capacity even in the absence of a pairing - phase transition , i.e. , when assuming a constant pairing gap at all temperatures due to the effect of particle - number conservation on quasi - particle excitations . in general , this method produces both an @xmath7-shaped heat capacity due to the effect of particle - number projection and a discontinuity in the heat capacity related to the pairing phase transition .",
    "inclusion of fluctuations and correlations beyond the bcs theory as induced by , e.g. , exact particle number projection , can be done starting with the path - integral representation of the partition function . a direct approach to evaluate the path integral",
    "is the shell - model monte - carlo method @xcite .",
    "however , the computational effort is quite large , and it can not be applied to the large shell - model spaces typical for heavy nuclei .",
    "the static - path approximation ( spa ) @xcite is therefore a useful treatment to evaluate approximately the partition function in finite systems with separable interactions . in recent theoretical approaches ,",
    "also small - amplitude fluctuations around the static path have been taken into account .",
    "these fluctuations give corrections to the partition function similar to the standard random - phase approximation around the mean field .",
    "thus , the static - path plus random - phase approximation ( spa+rpa ) method for interactions and temperature regions applied in @xcite gives excellent agreement with exact results @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will perform the exact number projected spa ( npspa ) , since the spa results for the @xmath3-shaped heat capacity qualitatively agree with the spa+rpa ones @xcite . for this",

    "one can see that the heat capacity exhibits an @xmath3 shape around @xmath83  mev @xcite .",
    "the number projection decreases the spa heat capacity for @xmath84  mev and increases it in the region of 0.35  mev@xmath85  mev , and hence enhances the @xmath3 shape .",
    "it is important to note that an @xmath3-shaped heat capacity is already obtained within the spa , without any number projection . to emphasize this point",

    "[ fig1 ] the heat capacity obtained from an independent - particle model without pairing , i.e. , for @xmath48 .",
    "as it should for a non - interacting fermi gas , this heat capacity depends almost linearly on temperature .",
    "the difference between the heat - capacity curves of the independent - particle model and the full model treated within the spa is large and qualitative . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference between the spa and npspa results is relatively smaller and quantitative in nature . when compared to experiment",
    ", the npspa can describe well the @xmath3-shape of the data , while the calculated @xmath86 curve deviates from the experimental one for temperatures below 0.5  mev .",
    "this difference may be a drawback of the spa approximation and of the simple model used with only a monopole pairing interaction and without any other interaction . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath1mo and in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath2fe , however , the spa does not produce an @xmath3-shaped heat capacity by itself in those cases ; the @xmath3 shape appears only in the npspa .",
    "a recent analysis of poles in the complex temperature plane @xcite suggests that the pairing phase transition exists for mass @xmath87 but not for @xmath88 .",
    "this interpretation seems to be consistent with the results obtained here .",
    "the @xmath3 shape has also been discussed to be correlated with the breaking of nucleon cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "therefore , we further investigate the neutron pairing properties in the calculations . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the neutron effective pairing gap @xmath89 in the spa and @xmath90 in the npspa , relative to their values at @xmath91 . the suppression of @xmath89 is well correlated in temperature with the presence of the @xmath3 shape of the heat capacity in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , consistent with the results of refs .",
    "thus , the @xmath3 shape in figs.[fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , and [ fig3 ] can be understood in terms of the suppression of the effective pairing gap and the effects of number projection .",
    "previously , we have identified the inflection point of the effective pairing - gap curve as the temperature at which the pairing transition takes place @xcite . as seen from the respective curves for @xmath0yb in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , this inflection point is close to the temperature 0.5  mev at which the heat - capacity curves peak . for @xmath1mo and @xmath2fe ,",
    "the respective inflection points of 0.65 mev and 0.9  mev are also close to the local maxima of their @xmath49 curves .    ) and the effective neutron pairing gap ( dashed line ) as a function of temperature for @xmath1mo . ]    as the experimental counterpart of the effective pairing gap , we have proposed in our previous work thermal odd - even mass differences ( toemd ) as a direct measure of the size of pairing correlations @xcite , and we have used them as indicators in our study of pairing phase transitions in @xmath92w @xcite and @xmath93mo @xcite .",
    "we obtained in the one case a drastic in the other case a gradual decrease of the toemd , and we found that this signal is well correlated with the @xmath3 shape of the heat capacity . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the sudden decrease of the thermal odd - even mass differences is interpreted as a rapid breaking of nucleon cooper pairs .",

    "the agreement between theory and experiment is satisfying .",
    "it is now interesting to discuss the significance of the @xmath3 shape of the heat capacity .",
    "for this reason , we would like to recall all the available facts . in the present work",
    ", the @xmath3 shape is obtained for @xmath87 already within the spa , while for lighter nuclei , to reproduce the @xmath3 shape , the npspa ( corresponding to a vap scheme ) is needed .",
    "interestingly , in the work of esashika _ et al .",
    "@xcite , an @xmath3 shape could also be obtained ( within a pav scheme ) when keeping the pairing gap @xmath61 artificially constant .",
    "the latter two observations seem to indicate that the presence of the @xmath3 shape is not necessarily related to the pairing phase transition , and might be connected more to the particle - number projection .",
    "however , one should remember that in calculations without a distinct pairing force @xmath99 , no @xmath3-shaped heat capacity has been observed .",
    "moreover , the temperature for a potential pairing phase transition derived from the @xmath3-shaped heat capacity agrees very well with the temperature where pairing correlations are being suppressed ( as indicated by the effective pairing gap @xcite ) , such that a simple coincidence of the two phenomena can likely be ruled out . at present , we leave the question of the significance of the @xmath3-shaped heat capacity somewhat open , while we would like to point out that the npspa is certainly an important tool to investigate this problem , since it enables us to obtain an @xmath3-shaped heat capacity for lighter nuclei in the first place . _",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated effects of particle - number conservation in the spa for @xmath0yb , @xmath1mo , and @xmath2fe .",
    "the particle - number projection affects the @xmath3 shape of the heat capacity in all of these nuclei .",
    "the @xmath3 shape in the heat capacity of @xmath0yb is produced by a cooperation of the quantum effects in the spa with the effects of particle - number projection . for @xmath1mo and @xmath2fe , however , the @xmath3 shape of the heat capacity appears only in the calculation with particle - number projection , but not in the spa alone .",
    "this observation is consistent with nuclear size effects on the existence of a pairing transition .",
    "the @xmath3-shaped heat capacity from npspa calculations correlates well in temperature with the reduction of the effective pairing gap .",
    "the effective neutron pairing gap in @xmath1mo is in good agreement with experimental thermal odd - even mass differences .",
    "our treatment of the particle - number projection can be applied together with the angular - momentum projection in order to study the spin distribution of nuclear levels in such a formalism as suggested in @xcite .",
