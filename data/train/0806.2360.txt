    "the following result shows that there are essentially no other examples :    _ ( alexandrov s existence theorem ) .",
    "every intrinsically convex @xmath3-dimensional polyhedral surface homeomorphic to a sphere is isometric to the surface of a convex polytope @xmath9 or to a doubly covered polygon . _",
    "there is a conjecture : _ every convex polyhedron has an edge net_. this question has a long story .",
    "the earliest reference to edge unfolding was made by albreht drer [ 2 ] . at first time",
    "this conjecutre was explicilty posted by sheppard in 1975 @xcite .    at first glance",
    "the conjecture seems to be true .",
    "if we take a polyhedron , it is very easy to find its unfolding .    even to find a polyhedron with at least one overlapping unfolding is not trivial .    on fig .",
    "[ unfolding ] we can see such example of overlapping unfolding to the thin truncated pyramid .",
    "it is clear that the unfolding has overlapping because the curvature ( angle defect ) of the upper base is very small and the left angle of the upper base is noticeable less than @xmath10 .",
    "we will use such idea later .",
    "it is convenient to consider this conjecture by thinking about a polyhedral surface as a metric space without embedding into @xmath8 .",
    "according to alexandrov s theorem , such embedding always exists and we do not need to care about it .",
    "it is easy to find vertices on a surface  they have total sum of angles less than @xmath11 . but",
    "points on edges and on faces do not have such distinctive features .",
    "there is no simple way without a lot of calculations to find edges skeleton .",
    "alexandrov s theorem says that such skeleton exists and unique , but does not give any way how to find it . there is a more constructive proof of this theorem ( @xcite ) .",
    "but still this proof need make a lot of calculations to find edges .",
    "then we have the following question : does edge - skeleton a really important in the drer conjecture .",
    "we can formulate a similar conjecture , which does not depend from edge - skeleton : _ let @xmath0 be a polyhedral surface homeomorphic to a sphere .",
    "let @xmath1 be a partition of @xmath0 into geodesic polygons , flat and convex in terms of the intrinsic metric ( see def .",
    "3 ) does there exist a non - overlapping unfolding of this polyhedral surface , whose spanning tree lies inside edge skeleton @xmath12 ? _",
    "in this paper we construct a counterexample to this question .",
    "a similar question about geodesic triangulated 1-skeletons was asked by jeff erickson  @xcite .",
    "_ let @xmath13 be an arbitray triangulation of a convex polytope whose vertices are the vertices of the polytope and whose edges are geodesics .",
    "can the surface by unfolded without self - overlap by cutting it along edges of @xmath13 ?",
    "_    it appears that for erickson s question similar counterexample can also be constructed .",
    "this question was inspired by another very interesting instinsic conjecture on the same conference :    bobenko s conjecture  @xcite _ can the boundary of a convex polytope be unfolded into the plane without self - overlap by cutting the surface along of the delaunay triangulation @xmath13 of the boundary ?",
    "( @xmath13 can have loops and multiple edges , but the faces are triangles ) .",
    "in particular , if all faces of a polytope are acute triangles , can it be unfolded by cutting along the edges of the polytope ? _    here another two similar conjectures by orourke  @xcite : _ prove ( or disprove ) that every convex polyhedron all of whose faces have no acute angles ( i.e. , all angles are @xmath14 ) has a non - overlapping edge - unfolding _     _ prove ( or disprove ) that every triangulated convex polyhedron , all of whose angles are non - obtuse , i.e. , @xmath15 , has a non - overlapping edge - unfolding . if the polyhedron has @xmath16 faces , what is the fewest nets into which it may be cut along edges ? _    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]    + these conditions were verified by a simple computer program and can be confirmed manually as well .",
