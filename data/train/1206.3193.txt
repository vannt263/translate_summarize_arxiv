    "sampling and counting colorings of a graph are fundamental problems in computer science and discrete mathematics .",
    "we consider the problem of sampling uniformly at random from the set @xmath9 of proper @xmath10-colorings of a graph @xmath11 .",
    "a proper @xmath10-coloring @xmath12 is a labeling @xmath13 such that all neighboring vertices have different colors .",
    "this sampling problem is also fundamental in statistical physics and corresponds to generating configurations from the gibbs distribution of the zero - temperature antiferromagnetic potts model @xcite . from the physics perspective , the underlying graph is typically taken to be the cubic lattice @xmath14 and sampling and counting reveal underlying thermodynamic properties of the corresponding physical system .",
    "much focus has gone towards solving the sampling problem using rapidly mixing markov chains .",
    "the idea is to design a markov chain whose stationary distribution is uniform over the set of proper colorings .",
    "then , starting at an arbitrary coloring and simulating a random walk according to this chain for a sufficient number of steps , we get a sample from close to the desired distribution .",
    "the number of steps required of this walk is referred to as the _ mixing time _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the chain is called _ rapidly mixing _",
    "if the mixing time is polynomial in @xmath15 ( so it converges quickly to stationarity ) ; it is _ torpidly mixing _ if its mixing time is super - polynomial in @xmath16 ( so it converges slowly ) .",
    "there has been a long history of studying mixing times of various chains in the context of colorings ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a particular focus of this study has been on _",
    "glauber dynamics_. for proper @xmath10-colorings this is any single - site update markov chain that connects two colorings only if they differ on at most a single vertex .",
    "the _ metropolis _",
    "chain @xmath17 on state space @xmath18 has transition probabilities @xmath19 , @xmath20 given by @xmath21 we may think of @xmath17 dynamically as follows . from a @xmath10-coloring @xmath12 , choose a vertex @xmath22 uniformly from @xmath23 and a color @xmath24 uniformly from @xmath25 . then recolor @xmath22 with color @xmath24 if this is a proper @xmath10-coloring ; otherwise stay at @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath17 is ergodic , its stationary distribution @xmath26 is uniform over proper @xmath10-colorings .",
    "a series of recent papers have shown that @xmath17 is rapidly mixing provided the number of colors is sufficiently large compared to the maximum degree ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "substantially less is known when the number of colors is small .",
    "in fact , for @xmath10 small it is np - complete to decide whether a graph admits even one @xmath10-coloring .",
    "in this paper we focus on the mixing rate of @xmath17 on rectangular regions of the cubic lattice @xmath27 .",
    "observe that the lattice is bipartite , so it always admits a @xmath10-coloring for any @xmath28 .",
    "it is also known that glauber dynamics connects the state space of @xmath10-colorings on any such lattice region @xcite . in @xmath29",
    "much is known about the mixing rate of @xmath17 .",
    "luby et al .",
    "@xcite showed that glauber dynamics for sampling 3-colorings is rapidly mixing on any finite , simply - connected subregion of @xmath29 when the colors on the boundary of the region are fixed .",
    "goldberg et al .",
    "@xcite subsequently showed that the chain remains fast on rectangular regions without this boundary restriction .",
    "substantially more is known when there are many colors : jerrum @xcite showed that glauber dynamics is rapidly mixing on any graph satisfying @xmath30 , where @xmath10 is the number of colors and @xmath31 is the maximum degree , thus showing glauber dynamics is fast on @xmath29 when @xmath32 .",
    "it has since been shown that it is fast for @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly the efficiency remains unresolved for @xmath34 or  @xmath35 .    in higher dimensions",
    "much less is known when @xmath10 is small .",
    "physicists have performed extensive numerical experiments @xcite suggesting that glauber dynamics on 3-colorings is torpidly mixing when the dimension of the cubic lattice is large enough .",
    "we prove this conjecture for the first time here by studying the mixing time of the chain on cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our focus in this paper is sampling 3-colorings of the even discrete torus @xmath6 .",
    "this is the graph on vertex set @xmath36 ( with @xmath37 even ) with edge set consisting of those pairs of vertices that differ on exactly one coordinate and differ by @xmath38 ( mod @xmath37 ) on that coordinate . for a markov chain @xmath4 on the 3-colorings of @xmath6",
    "we denote by @xmath39 the mixing time of the chain ; this will be formally defined in section [ sec - partitioning ] .",
    "our main theorem is the following .",
    "[ thm-glauber.slow.mixing ] there is a constant @xmath40 for which the following holds . for @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "even , the glauber dynamics chain @xmath43 on @xmath44 satisfies @xmath45    our techniques actually apply to a more general class of chains .",
    "a markov chain @xmath4 on state space @xmath46 is _",
    "@xmath47-local _ if , in each step of the chain , at most @xmath48 vertices have their color changed ; that is , if @xmath49 implies @xmath50 these types of chains were introduced in @xcite , where the terminology _",
    "@xmath48-cautious _ was employed .",
    "we prove the following , which easily implies theorem  [ thm-glauber.slow.mixing ] .",
    "[ thm-rho.local.slow.mixing ] fix @xmath51 satisfying @xmath52 .",
    "there is a constant @xmath53 for which the following holds . for @xmath41 and @xmath42 even , if @xmath4 is an ergodic @xmath47-local markov chain on @xmath44 with uniform stationary distribution then @xmath54    here @xmath55 is the usual binary entropy function .",
    "note that all @xmath56 satisfy @xmath52 .",
    "we show slow mixing via a conductance argument by identifying a `` bad cut '' in the state space requiring exponential time to cross . intuitively , in sufficiently high dimension , the set of 3-colorings of the lattice is believed to naturally partition into 6 classes : each class is identified by a predominance of one ( of 3 ) colors on one of the two ( even or odd ) sublattices .",
    "this characterization was recently rigorously verified on the infinite lattice , thereby establishing the existence of 6 distinct `` maximal entropy gibbs states '' @xcite .",
    "that work builds heavily on technical machinery introduced by galvin and kahn @xcite showing that independent sets partition similarly in sufficiently high dimensions in that they lie primarily on the even or odd sublattices .",
    "specifically , write @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the sets of even and odd vertices of @xmath27 ( defined in the obvious way ) and set @xmath59^d$ ] and @xmath60^d \\setminus [ -(l-1),l-1]^d$ ] . for @xmath61 , choose @xmath62 from @xmath63 ( the set of independent sets of the box ) with @xmath64 . galvin and kahn showed that for @xmath65 ( for a large constant @xmath66 ) and fixed @xmath67 @xmath68 in other words , the influence of the boundary on the center of a large box persists as the boundary recedes .",
    "notice that neither of the results of @xcite or @xcite establishing the presence of multiple gibbs states directly implies anything about the behavior of markov chains on finite lattice regions .",
    "however , they do suggest that in the finite setting , typical configurations fall into the distinct classes described in stationarity and that it will be unlikely to move between these classes ; the remaining configurations are expected to have negligible weight for large lattice regions , even when they are finite .",
    "galvin @xcite extended the results of @xcite , showing that in sufficiently high dimension , glauber dynamics on independent sets mixes slowly in rectangular regions of @xmath69 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "similar results were known previously about independent sets ; however , one significant new contribution of @xcite was showing that as @xmath3 increases , the critical @xmath70 above which glauber dynamics mixes slowly tends to @xmath71 .",
    "in particular , there is some dimension @xmath72 such that for all @xmath73 , glauber dynamics will be slow on @xmath14 when @xmath74 .",
    "this turns out to be the crucial new ingredient allowing us to rigorously verify slow mixing for sampling 3-colorings in high dimensions , as there turns out to be a close connection between the independent set model at @xmath74 and the @xmath5-coloring model .",
    "note that unlike most statistical physics models , the 3-coloring problem does not have a parameter @xmath70 that can be tweaked to establish desired bounds ; this makes the proofs here significantly more delicate than the usual slow mixing arguments .",
    "section [ subsec - overview ] provides a more detailed discussion of the elements of the proof and of some of the difficulties inherent to the sampling problem under discussion .",
    "we begin by formalizing some definitions . given a markov chain @xmath75 on state space @xmath76 with uniform stationary distribution denoted by @xmath77 ,",
    "let @xmath78 be the distribution of the chain at time @xmath79 given that it started in state @xmath80 .",
    "the _ mixing time _ @xmath39 of @xmath4 is defined to be @xmath81 where @xmath82 via a well - known _ conductance argument _",
    "@xcite , using a form of the argument derived in @xcite . as above , let @xmath4 be an ergodic markov chain on state space @xmath83 with transition probabilities @xmath84 and stationary distribution @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath85 and @xmath86 satisfy @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "then from @xcite we have @xmath89    let us return to the setup of theorem [ thm-rho.local.slow.mixing ]",
    ". for even @xmath37 , @xmath6 is bipartite with partition classes @xmath57 ( consisting of those vertices the sum of whose coordinates is even ) and @xmath58 . to show torpid mixing , it is sufficient to identify a single bad cut .",
    "we concentrate on the vertices in each 3-coloring that are colored with the first color , 0",
    ". the objective of theorem  [ thm-rho.local.slow.mixing ] will be to verify that most 3-colorings have an imbalance whereby the vertices colored 0 lie predominantly on @xmath57 or @xmath58 , and those that are roughly balanced on the two sublattices are highly unlikely in stationarity .",
    "this is sufficient to show that the conductance is small .",
    "accordingly let us define the set of `` balanced '' @xmath5-colorings by @xmath90 and likewise let @xmath91 by symmetry , @xmath92 .",
    "notice that since @xmath4 updates at most @xmath93 vertices in each step , we have that if @xmath94 and @xmath95 then @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , by ( [ conductance_bound ] ) , @xmath97 and so theorem [ thm-rho.local.slow.mixing ] follows from the following critical theorem .",
    "[ thm - main ] fix @xmath51 satisfying @xmath52 .",
    "there is a constant @xmath53 for which the following holds . for @xmath73 and @xmath2 even , @xmath98",
    "for a generic @xmath99 there are regions of @xmath6 consisting predominantly of even vertices colored @xmath71 together with their neighbors , and regions consisting of odd vertices colored @xmath71 together with their neighbors .",
    "these regions are separated by two - layer `` @xmath71-free '' moats or _",
    "cutsets_. in section [ subsec - cutsets ] we describe a procedure that selects a particular collection of these cutsets .",
    "our main technical result , lemma [ lem-volume.bounds.from.gk ] , asserts that for each specification of cutset sizes @xmath100 and vertices @xmath101 , the probability that a coloring has among its associated cutsets a collection @xmath102 with @xmath103 and with @xmath104 surrounded by @xmath105 is exponentially small in the sum of the @xmath106 s .",
    "this lemma is presented in section [ subsec-results.from.galvinkahn ] and theorem [ thm - main ] is derived from it in section [ subsec - proof_of_thm ] .",
    "the main thrust of @xcite is the proof of a result that is essentially ( but not quite ) the case @xmath107 of lemma [ lem-volume.bounds.from.gk ] .",
    "one difficulty we have to overcome in moving from a gibbs measure argument to a torpid mixing argument is that of going from bounding the probability of a configuration having a single cutset to bounding the probability of it having an ensemble of cutsets .",
    "another difficulty is that the cutsets we consider in these ensembles can be topologically more complex than the connected cutsets that are considered in @xcite . in part ,",
    "both of these difficulties are dealt with by the machinery developed in @xcite .",
    "we use a `` peierl s argument '' to prove lemma [ lem-volume.bounds.from.gk ] . by carefully modifying each @xmath108 inside its cutsets",
    ", we can exploit the fact that the cutsets are @xmath71-free to map @xmath12 to a set @xmath109 of many different @xmath110 .",
    "if the @xmath109 s were disjoint for distinct @xmath12 s , we would essentially be done , having shown that there are many more @xmath5-colorings in total than @xmath5-colorings in @xmath111 . to control the possible overlap",
    ", we define a flow @xmath112 supported on pairs @xmath113 with @xmath114 in such a way that the flow out of each @xmath115 is @xmath38 .",
    "any uniform bound we can obtain on the flow into elements of @xmath46 is then easily seen to be a bound on @xmath116 .",
    "we define the flow via a notion of approximation modified from @xcite . to each cutset",
    "@xmath117 we associate a set @xmath118 that approximates the interior of @xmath117 in a precise sense , in such a way that as we run over all possible @xmath117 , the total number of approximate sets used is small .",
    "then for each @xmath119 and each collection of approximations @xmath120 , we consider the set of those @xmath99 with @xmath121 and with @xmath122 the approximation to @xmath105 .",
    "we define the flow so that if this set is large , then @xmath123 is small for each @xmath12 in the set . in this way we control the flow into @xmath124 corresponding to each collection of approximations @xmath125 ; since the total number of approximations is small , we control the total flow into @xmath124 . in the language of statistical physics ,",
    "this approximation scheme is a _ course - graining _ argument .",
    "the details appear in section  [ sec - proofs ] .",
    "the main results of @xcite and @xcite are proved along similar lines to those described above .",
    "one of the difficulties we encounter in moving from these arguments on independent sets to arguments on colorings is that of finding an analogous way of modifying a coloring inside a cutset in order to exploit the fact that it is @xmath71-free .",
    "the beginning of section [ sec - proofs ] ( in particular claims [ claim-shift.works ] and [ claim-unique.reconstruction ] ) describes an appropriate modification that has all the properties we desire .",
    "we describe a way of associating with each @xmath99 a collection of minimal edge cutsets , following the approaches of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first we need a little notation .",
