    "there are many proposals to convert light into mechanical energy using smart polymeric photo - responsive materials  @xcite or the synthesis of individual molecules that lead to rotary or linear motion  @xcite .",
    "photoresponsive materials use a conformational change of a macroscopic collection of polymers in response to light or an external change in temperature and ph .",
    "this will cause a change in volume .",
    "if this process is reversible , which it is in many instances , this device can be cycled to derive mechanical energy  @xcite .    in general , there are many scenarios leading to a change in configuration of a molecule in response to light  @xcite : _ cis - trans _ isomerization , zwitter ion formation , radical formation , ionic dissociation , and ring formation / cleavage . if such light - sensitive elements are incorporated into a macromolecular system , this can in principle , through thermodynamic cycles , to conversion of light to mechanical power .",
    "remarkable advances in the design of molecules have led to prototypes for light - driven synthetic molecular motors  @xcite .",
    "many of these are based on photoisomerization reactions that enable rotary motion of molecules when combined with thermal rotation steps  @xcite .",
    "it has also been possible to make threading - dethreading systems  @xcite , and shuttle molecular rings  @xcite .",
    "there has even been progress on a macroscopic level , such as creating droplet motion by modifying surface properties  @xcite or inducing mechanical deformation  @xcite similar to what is achieved with photo - responsive materials  @xcite .",
    "much of the research in this area is inspired by biological machines such as myosin ii that work by quite a different principle than man - made macroscopic motors  @xcite .",
    "biological motors use chemical energy rather than photons to produce mechanical power however this difference does not affect the basic mechanism of operation .",
    "a myosin head can be thought of as being in two states , bound or unbound .",
    "thermal noise in the unbound state can cause the head to bind to actin , producing a force .",
    "the hydrolysis of atp releases energy causing the head to return to the unbound state .",
    "the biochemistry of a real motor protein is considerably more complicated , but by simplifying this description to one involving only these two states , the motion can be analyzed , and it is easily seen that electromagnetic energy can be used instead of chemical energy  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "i investigate the use of photons in powering a two state motor system similar to biological motors .",
    "i consider creating motion between two surfaces that are very close together by placing an asymmetric polymer brush between them .",
    "this could potentially have advantages .",
    "a continuous source of light would create a motion that is constant on a macroscopic scale , that could for example , rotate the surfaces relative to each other .",
    "it would not require any additional mechanisms to keep it moving , other than the microscopic motion of molecules between the plates .",
    "the device proposed here falls into a distinct category different than the experimental approaches above .",
    "it is not a macroscopic smart material that changes properties in response to external stimuli .",
    "the device described in the next section works on the scale of an individual polymers , and the force generated on the surfaces is the sum of these molecules acting independently of each other .",
    "however it is unlike the chemical synthesis approach that requires different states of isomerization .",
    "the principles that it relies on are robust and just require photodissociation of polymer to a binding site , and , as in the case of biological motors , some degree of asymmetry .",
    "this asymmetry , plus a disruption of thermal equilibrium due to energy input are the two factors needed to convert energy from chemical or electromagnetic energy , to mechanical  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : device ] .    * * a flat plate of semi - flexible polymer brushes*. polymer brushes are polymers , each with one end tethered to a wall in a suitable solvent . * * a parallel plate right above the brush*. these polymers are put in contact with a parallel plate close to the surface so that their ends are able to interact with it . * * the parallel plate contains an array of photoreactive binding sites . *",
    "it is crucial that these polymers bind with the surface in an asymmetric way , so that the average binding orientation of each is the same , and not perpendicular to the plate . * * at least one of the plates is transparent .",
    "* light causes the unbinding of polymer ends from the photoreactive binding sites .",
    "* * binding catalyst*. to control the rate at which binding occurs , the binding of the end of the polymer to a binding site can be facilitated by the use of a catalyst .",
    "the concentration of the catalyst can be used to control the rate of binding .",
    "\\(a )   ( b )     in most of the discussion below , the polymers can be considered to be separated from each other by a sufficient distance so that we can ignore inter - chain interactions .",
    "the absorption of light causing unbinding will happen asynchronously .",
    "the ends tethered to the lower plates are at positions that are either random or incommensurate with the binding sites of the upper plate .",
    "altogether this means that the motion of each polymer is uncorrelated with the others in the system .",
    "the total effect of the forces acting on the plates can be used to perform work against a force acting on the upper plate . because we assume that the number of polymers contributing is very large and are asynchronous",
    ", the net velocity of the upper plate @xmath0 will be constant , as will be the net force acting on the plate .",
    "in the following we will analyze the system and model it in different ways to better understand the power generation .",
    "we will now make a crude estimate with realistic parameters , how well this device should work .",
    "we envisage separate one dimensional tracks of the kind shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : device](b ) .",
    "the spacing between the tracks could be greater than the distances between polymers on a single track . in reality , it might prove more efficacious to manufacture a square array of polymers and binding sites but we will allow two separate length scales in our analysis below .",
    "we will assume a solar intensity of @xmath1 , and an average photon energy of @xmath2 .",
    "we will take the relaxation time of a polymer to be @xmath3 , which corresponds roughly to a polymer size of @xmath4",
    ". the number of unbinding events , if every photon was absorbed at a binding site , is @xmath5 .",
    "if the density of polymers is @xmath6 , then for all of these events to be utilized requires @xmath7 , or @xmath8 , which is a separation of @xmath9 .",
    "the amount of energy per step that is gained by a photo - dissociation event is of order @xmath10 . with such parameters",
    ", this is expected to yield an efficiency of order @xmath11 . however , as we will show below , longer relaxation times allow for more energy per step , and this requires a higher polymer density .",
    "however the two dimensional density is limited by inter - chain interactions . in the case considered here , this density could be increased roughly by three orders of magnitude .",
    "however the relaxation time for this system depends exponentially on the force generated , so a three order of magnitude increase in relaxation time would only increase the efficiency by a factor of about @xmath12 furthermore , the detailed analysis presented below suggests that with optimal conditions , the efficiency of conversion is about @xmath13 . to increase the efficiency of solar conversion further might require stacking devices .",
    "there are other means of increasing the solar conversion efficiency by first converting solar radiation to lower energy photons .",
    "for example , two methods for doing this are fluorescent down - conversion of solar photons  @xcite , or thermophotovoltaic down - conversion  @xcite .",
    "further speculation on device efficiency is premature as there will undoubtedly be many unforeseen technical problems that will likely provide other obstacles to increasing device efficiency .",
    "however an efficiency for direct photo - mechanical conversion of about @xmath13 is still a useful amount of power comparable to photovoltaic conversion with amorphous solar cells , and also because power is lost in electro - mechanical conversion , which is not a problem with direct mechanical energy conversion .",
    "we start by simulating a three dimensional model of this system .",
    "there are two components to the system , the polymer and the binding sites .",
    "the polymer chain is modeled as having @xmath14 links of fixed length , and is semiflexible with chain stiffness @xmath15 .",
    "denote the coordinates of the @xmath16 bead as @xmath17 .",
    "the elastic potential for the middle of the chain for the @xmath16 bead is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the elastic constant .",
    "the binding potential of the polymer has two components , an isotropic component @xmath20 and directional component @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is short range with a length scale @xmath23 and scale @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath21 uses a direction @xmath26 so that the difference between the last two end beads @xmath27 will give a minimum in @xmath21 along that direction @xmath28    the end attached to the lower surface is always bound .",
    "the other end can bind to a periodic linear array of binding sites equally spaced at a distance @xmath29 .",
    "there are two states that the system can be in , unbound , @xmath30 , and bound @xmath31 .",
    "there are two parameters that control binding , the rate at which dissociation occurs @xmath32 , and the rate that dissociated ends can be rebound @xmath33 .",
    "the distance between the lower and upper surface is @xmath34 and their relative velocity is @xmath35 .",
    "the model was simulated with a langevin equation , at finite temperature @xmath36 .",
    "although inertial effects are typically small at these microscopic scales , it was included for completeness .",
    "an algorithm was used that efficiently updates this system with fixed link lengths  @xcite .",
    "the simulation was run to determine how the force and power generated are influenced by the plate velocity .",
    "[ fig:3dfvsv ] shows the results of four simulations with different values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "the force generated is highest approaching zero velocity and decreases until it becomes negative , at which point it is taking mechanical energy to move it at such high speeds .",
    "qualitatively , this is the point where frictional drag dominates over photo - energy conversion .",

    ", the simulation was run for small elastic constant @xmath51 , at different values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , but with all other parameters the same as above .",
    "this higher power is still at the expense of efficiency , as higher dissociation rates imply a higher photon flux .",
    "\\(a )   ( b )",
    "to understand the above simulation in more detail , requires a better understanding of the mechanisms involved .",
    "there have been a very large number of works on the theory of motor proteins  @xcite , and we will follow the two state approach mentioned above of prost _ et .",
    "the major difference is that they considered the two states to be periodic potentials , whereas here we model the system to more closely mimic the particular device we are investigating allowing the exploration of force versus velocity . hence instead of considering the position of a particle moving between two periodic potentials , we consider the unbound state to have a free end described as moving in a bound potential around the tether point . likewise , because of this tethering , the bound state potential is not periodic but has a periodic component as we will describe in detail below .",
    "here we consider the probability distribution for this system in steady state , which is described by a fokker planck equation .    initially to calculate the power that is produced , we will concentrate on the low velocity limit , with the two plates moving so slowly that this motion does not affect chain conformations appreciably . in this way",
    ", we can consider the average force exerted between the plates by a polymer in steady state in the limit @xmath52 so that the tether point is not moving .",
    "it is most convenient to let the point at which the polymer is tethered to the bottom plate be a variable parameter @xmath53 .",
    "with this point fixed , we consider the distribution of the other end of the polymer @xmath54 .",
    "we will assume that the internal dynamics of the chain chain are much faster than the binding and unbinding rates , so that the only degrees of freedom are @xmath54 , and if the polymer is bound , @xmath55 is unbound and @xmath56 is bound .",
    "therefore the probability distribution of the system can be described by a function @xmath57 .",
    "the equations describing this are  @xcite    [ eq : fp ] @xmath58    where the last @xmath59 argument of @xmath60 has been left out for notational simplicity .",

    "the left hand sides of these equations are zero .",

    "we are then left with @xmath80 as is expected because @xmath81 is confined to a region of space so that the average velocity , and hence average force , will be zero .",

    ". we would like to calculate the work done in moving the lower point @xmath59 by one period of @xmath70 .",

    "in order to investigate how the power conversion depends on the forces acting on this system , it is important to simplify the three dimensional model to obtain a minimal model that depends on far fewer parameters .",
    "therefore we investigate this model in one dimension .    a key point to understand",

    "depending on which interval @xmath175 is in , @xmath75 will equilibrate to the corresponding metastable equilibrium with @xmath176 and is completely confined to that interval .",
    "the relative probabilities being in one of the three above regions is obtained by the area under @xmath78 for that interval .",
    "now we know how to determine @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we would like to calculate the work @xmath91 given by eq .",
    "[ eq : defnwl ] . because of the symmetric form assumed for @xmath177 , the @xmath178 term in the integrand gives zero contribution and we are left with @xmath179 and consider first how to calculate the inner integral @xmath180 where @xmath99 is the position of the tethered end .",
    "[ eq : v0cutoff ] gives @xmath181 for @xmath182 .",
    "using the prescription we have found for @xmath183 , which is simplified by the above physical interpretation , we can partition this integral into the different @xmath75-intervals of metastability : @xmath184 $ ] , @xmath185 $ ] , and @xmath186 $ ] .",
    "the value of @xmath183 depends on the probability of initially being trapped in one of those three intervals .",
    "because of the cutoff we have imposed on @xmath121 , only two intervals need be considered for a given value of @xmath99 . for @xmath187 , only intervals @xmath188 and @xmath189 occur . the probability that @xmath190 given @xmath99 is @xmath191 and the probability that @xmath192 that is , @xmath193 .",
    "here @xmath194 is proportional to @xmath195 but normalized to unity , to simplify the presentation .",
    "we can obtain the values for @xmath196 by symmetry , so that @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "@xmath199 is simply related to the complementary error function in the limit considered here , where the effects of the cutoff in the potential will have negligible effect , @xmath200 .",
    "there is a symmetry in many of the quantities considered , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dpot ] where the potential @xmath121 and corresponding probability distribution @xmath201 is for the tethering point at @xmath99 and at @xmath131 .",
    "therefore it is convenient to consider @xmath202 .",
    "this can be written as @xmath203 where @xmath204 and @xmath205    the four terms in eq .",

    "the factors involving @xmath209 give the correct normalization according to eq .",

    "[ eq : v0cutoff ] , the integrand simplifies because @xmath211 becomes exponentially close to @xmath99 , and the only term remaining is @xmath99 .",
    "thus for large @xmath29 , @xmath212 the factors involving the @xmath209 s represent the fraction of time spent in the bound configuration .",
    "the last term increases quadratically with @xmath29 .",
    "this result is misleading if not taken with the appropriate limits that have been assumed in its derivation .",
    "the factor @xmath213 is very close to unity as we are assuming that the relaxation time in the unbound state is much faster than in the bound state , hence @xmath214 .",
    "however the work @xmath91 to move a distance @xmath29 was assumed to be in the adiabatic limit , and here the time scales associated with bound state relaxation are exponentially long .",
    "this is because to reach this metastable equilibrium the particle has to hop over barriers of size @xmath215 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1dpot ] . hence the longest relaxation time for this is at @xmath216 and is of order @xmath217 .",
    "note that this does not contradict our assumption that we are still in a region of metastability , which requires times much less than @xmath218 .",
    "but for this to work , we require that @xmath219    now we consider the case where the spring length cutoff @xmath220 .",
    "the disadvantage of this is that the chain end can , in principle , hop over many barriers ending up arbitrarily far from the tether point , and that these hopping times should be included in the above analysis .",
    "however , the probability of such a hop becomes negligible when the probability of finding the chain end there is small .",
    "hence we still have a clear separation of time scales between metastable states as discussed above , and fully equilibrated system , which requires surmounting the energy barrier @xmath128 . in this case , we can therefore assume that when the chain end @xmath99 is between @xmath221 and @xmath222 , it will strongly localized at @xmath223 .",
    "therefore @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the probability of initially finding the chain end between @xmath221 and @xmath222 , @xmath226 it is easily seen that @xmath227 . using this and eq .",
    "[ eq : inflcfl ] @xmath228 to obtain the work , we follow the same procedure as above and consider @xmath202 , which here is just @xmath229 . therefore in this case ,",
    "@xmath230 which in this model exactly , for all @xmath105 and @xmath29 , given that we are in a region of strong metastability .",
    "we now are in a position to answer a central question about the performance of this kind of device : is the efficiency limited by the small value of @xmath10 compared to photon energies ?",
    "we have seen from the above analysis that it is possible to get arbitrarily large forces developing at the expense of exponentially slow operation .",
    "however this is in the limit of infinitesimal plate velocity @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , the power obtained is instead average force times this , @xmath231 and we would like to operate the device at the velocity of maximum power , which necessitates the operation of it far from equilibrium , because compensating the increase in @xmath35 is a decrease in @xmath232 due to dissipation .",
    "it could be that the optimum velocity of operation decreases very quickly with @xmath233 meaning that the device becomes increasingly inefficient as the spring constant @xmath105 is increased .",
    "this would make it impossible to harvest more than of order @xmath10 energy per cycle .",
    "the efficiency is defined as the ratio of the amount of power produced to the amount of power put in .",
    "the amount of energy needed to dissociate a polymer end from a binding site is @xmath129 .",
    "binding to @xmath129 must produce an energy less than that of an unbound polymer .",
    "the power put in is @xmath234 where @xmath235 .",
    "therefore the efficiency is @xmath236    to investigate this problem further , the one dimensional model of the last section with @xmath237 was implemented using metropolis monte carlo .",
    "we chose the periodic potential @xmath72 to vary as @xmath238 here we set @xmath239 , @xmath240 , and @xmath241 . in order to preserve diffusional dynamics , steps in x",
    "were attempted uniformly in the range @xmath242 $ ] ensuring that the periodic potential can not be jumped across in one move .",
    "one move increased the time by @xmath243 , though this number was arbitrary and aside from an obvious rescaling , does not affect the results obtained .    to observe behavior in the limit of metastability",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the rate of unbinding must be set to be small compared to the inverse metastable equilibration time in the bound state .",
    "hence we chose the unbinding rate @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "as the simulation was running , the tether point was moved at velocity @xmath35 which was typically small , the average spring force @xmath232 was measured as a function of @xmath35 for a given spring constant @xmath105 .",
    "the results of a run of @xmath246 steps are shown in fig . [",
    "fig:1dfvsv](a ) .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    we are interested in the limit of large @xmath105 although this is hard to achieve numerically owing to exponentially long relaxation times .",
    "the parameters used allow us to probe up to @xmath248 . in the large @xmath105 limit , the minimum value of @xmath129 needed to bind , is @xmath249 , where @xmath250 is the maximum amount the spring will need to stretch from the tether to the binding site . because @xmath239 and @xmath241 , this implies @xmath251 .",
    "therefore our formula for the efficiency , given this input energy is @xmath252 , where @xmath253 is the maximum of the power versus velocity , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig:1dfvsv](a ) . plotting the efficiency for different values of @xmath105 ranging from @xmath254 to @xmath255 yields the points in fig . [ fig:1dfvsv](b ) . despite the fact that the relaxation time for metastable relaxation of the system varies over more than two orders of magnitude , the overall efficiency is almost constant .",
    "we expect at higher value of @xmath105 , the efficiency will eventually drop owing to the fact that the average unbinding time becoming smaller than the metastable relaxation time .",
    "what the above analysis shows is that in the limit where the photon cross section can be made arbitrarily low , the efficiency can be adjusted to be constant , independent of the photon energy .",
    "this is accomplished by choosing a large spring coefficient . in reality with photon energy of @xmath256 and @xmath257",
    ", photon flux would have to be far too low for this optimal regime to be realizable .",
    "however the above analysis also shows that the efficiency can be substantially increased by choosing larger @xmath105 at the expense of lowering the cross section .",
    "the energy delivered in one cycle should scale as @xmath258 .",
    "this can be increased to be substantially larger than thermal energies but at the expense of a long relaxation time proportional to @xmath259 . as noted earlier",
    ", it should be possible to make @xmath260 about @xmath261 , with reasonable parameter estimates .",
    "here we have analyzed the viability of converting photons to mechanical energy using a device composed of an canted polymer brush tethered to a lower plate but able to bind its other ends to sites on an upper plate .",
    "photons can dissociate these ends from binding sites . by a combination of analytical and numerical arguments we showed that in steady state , this produces net mechanical power .",
    "the system is inspired by biological motors such as myosin ii that bind to actin and is dissociated by the binding of atp .",
    "the analysis used here could also be applied to such systems , however in reality they contain many more stages . in general , these kind of systems are classified as  thermal ratchets \"  @xcite , where the system can be thought of as moving in a washboard potential in the presence of thermal noise .",
    "though that description can be very useful in understanding the general principles behind the operation of such motors , in the present case , we are trying to model the system in more detail than such models can afford .",
    "instead we have described the system using langevin dynamics and also two coupled fokker - planck equations similar in spirit but not identical to previous approaches  @xcite .",
    "the difference here is that for potentials to be a sensible model for a polymer tethered to a single point , they can not be periodic .",
    "such modelling allows us to see how varying microscopic parameters affect the power and force characteristics .",
    "the analytical results on the unbound equilibration model and extensive one dimensional simulations , show that the force applied by the device can be made arbitrarily large at the expense of having exponentially long relaxation times . at a given photon flux ,",
    "the production of large forces from single polymers imply the need for a very low cross section of interaction between the photon and the bound end plus binding site , as long relaxation times are required .",
    "therefore there is a trade off between this force and the speed the device can move .",
    "this may be circumvented to some extent by stacking transparent devices of this kind , so that even though the cross - section of interaction of an individual photon with a given layer is low , it will eventually be captured by one layer .",
    "therefore it appears that there is no theoretical obstacle to prevent the photo - mechanical conversion of energy in this manner , however it represents a significant experimental challenge .",
    "it has been pointed out  @xcite that there is an important distinction between artificial molecular switches and artificial molecular machines , the former being a fraction of a penny , and the latter being extremely challenging to create .",
    "the approach investigated here is closer to biological motors than other proposals , and should be more forgiving about randomness , either during fabrication , or due to thermal motion , than approaches that require precise chemical synthesis of molecules capable of sophisticated conformational changes  @xcite .",
    "however its experimental realization is still quite clearly a formidable task .",
