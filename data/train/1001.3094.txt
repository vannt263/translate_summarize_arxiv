    "symplectic field theory ( sft ) , introduced by h. hofer , a. givental and y. eliashberg in 2000 ( [ egh ] ) , is a very large project and can be viewed as a topological quantum field theory approach to gromov - witten theory . besides providing a unified view on",

    "+ while symplectic field theory leads to algebraic invariants with very rich algebraic structures , it was pointed out by eliashberg in his icm 2006 plenary talk ( [ e ] ) that the integrable systems of rational gromov - witten theory very naturally appear in rational symplectic field theory by using the link between the rational symplectic field theory of prequantization spaces in the morse - bott version and the rational gromov - witten potential of the underlying symplectic manifold , see the recent papers [ r1 ] , [ r2 ] by the second author . indeed , after introducing gravitational descendants as in gromov - witten theory",
    ", it is precisely the rich algebraic formalism of sft with its weyl and poisson structures that provides a natural link between symplectic field theory and ( quantum ) integrable systems . + carefully defining a generalization of gravitational descendants and adding them to the picture , the first author has shown in [ f ] that one can assign to every contact manifold an infinite sequence of commuting hamiltonian systems on sft homology and the question of their integrability arises . for this",
    "it is important to fully understand the algebraic structure of gravitational descendants in sft . while it is well - known that in gromov - witten theory the topological meaning of gravitational descendants leads to new differential equations for the gromov - witten potential , it is interesting to ask how these rich algebraic structures carry over from gromov - witten theory to symplectic field theory . + as a first step",
    ", we will show in this paper how the well - known string , dilaton and divisor equations generalize from gromov - witten theory to symplectic field theory , where the key point is the covariance of the algebraic constructions under choices of auxiliary data like contact form , cylindrical almost complex structure , abstract perturbations and coherent collections of sections used to define gravitational descendants",
    ". it will turn that we obtained the same equations as in gromov - witten theory ( up to contributions of constant curves ) , but these however only hold after passing to sft homology . +",
    "most of this paper was written when both authors were members of the mathematical sciences research institute ( msri ) in berkeley and it was finished when the first author was a postdoc at the max planck institute ( mpi ) for mathematics in the sciences in germany and the second author was a postdoc at the institut de mathematiques de jussieu , paris vi .",

    "it shows how to assign algebraic invariants to closed contact manifolds @xmath0 : + recall that a contact one - form @xmath1 defines a vector field @xmath2 on @xmath3 by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which is called the reeb vector field .",
    "we assume that the contact form is morse in the sense that all closed orbits of the reeb vector field are nondegenerate in the sense of [ behwz ] ; in particular , the set of closed reeb orbits is discrete .",
    "the invariants are defined by counting @xmath6-holomorphic curves in @xmath7 which are asymptotically cylindrical over chosen collections of reeb orbits @xmath8 as the @xmath9-factor tends to @xmath10 , see [ behwz ] .",
    "the almost complex structure @xmath6 on the cylindrical manifold @xmath7 is required to be cylindrical in the sense that it is @xmath9-independent , links the two natural vector fields on @xmath7 , namely the reeb vector field @xmath2 and the @xmath9-direction @xmath11 , by @xmath12 , and turns the distribution @xmath13 on @xmath3 into a complex subbundle of @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",

    "hamiltonian_. in order to include also higher - dimensional moduli spaces , in [ egh ]",
    "the authors follow the approach in gromov - witten theory to integrate the chosen differential forms @xmath54 over the moduli spaces after pulling them back under the evaluation map from target manifold @xmath3 . the hamiltonian @xmath55 is then defined by @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "expanding @xmath61 we further get a rational hamiltonian @xmath62 , which counts only curves with genus zero .",
    "+ while the hamiltonian @xmath55 explicitly depends on the chosen contact form , the cylindrical almost complex structure , the differential forms and abstract polyfold perturbations making all moduli spaces regular , it is outlined in [ egh ] how to construct algebraic invariants , which just depend on the contact structure and the cohomology classes of the differential forms .",
    "+ in complete analogy to gromov - witten theory we can introduce @xmath18 tautological line bundles @xmath63 over each moduli space @xmath64 , where the fibre of @xmath65 over a punctured curve @xmath66 is again given by the cotangent line to the underlying , possibly unstable nodal riemann surface ( without ghost components ) at the @xmath67.th marked point and which again formally can be defined as the pull - back of the vertical cotangent line bundle of @xmath68 under the canonical section @xmath69 mapping to the @xmath67.th marked point in the fibre .",
    "note again that while the vertical cotangent line bundle is rather a sheaf ( the dualizing sheaf ) than a true bundle since it becomes singular at the nodes in the fibres , the pull - backs under the canonical sections are still true line bundles as the marked points are different from the nodes and hence these sections avoid the singular loci .",
    "+ while in gromov - witten theory the gravitational descendants were defined by integrating powers of the first chern class of the tautological line bundle over the moduli space , which by poincare duality corresponds to counting common zeroes of sections in this bundle , in symplectic field theory , more generally every holomorphic curves theory where curves with punctures and/or boundary are considered , we are faced with the problem that the moduli spaces generically have codimension - one boundary , so that the count of zeroes of sections in general depends on the chosen sections in the boundary .",
    "it follows that the integration of the first chern class of the tautological line bundle over a single moduli space has to be replaced by a construction involving all moduli space at once .",
    "note that this is similar to the choice of coherent abstract perturbations for the moduli spaces in symplectic field theory in order to achieve transversality for the cauchy - riemann operator . + keeping the interpretation of descendants as common zero sets of sections in powers of the tautological line bundles , the first author defined in his paper [ f ] the notion of _ coherent collections of sections _",

    "@xmath71 , which were obtained inductively as zero sets of these coherent collections of sections @xmath72 in the tautological line bundles over the descendant moduli spaces @xmath73 .",
    "+ so far we have only considered the case with one additional marked point .",
    "on the other hand , as already outlined in [ f ] , the general case with @xmath18 additional marked points is just notationally more involved .",
    "indeed , we can easily define for every moduli space @xmath64 with @xmath18 additional marked points and every @xmath18-tuple of natural numbers @xmath74 descendants @xmath75 by setting @xmath76 where the descendant moduli spaces @xmath77 are defined in the same way as the one - point descendant moduli spaces @xmath78 by looking at the @xmath18 tautological line bundles @xmath79 over the moduli space @xmath80 separately .",

    "the goal of this paper is to understand how the well - known divisor , dilaton and string equations from gromov - witten theory generalize to symplectic field theory . here",

    "more precisely it depends not only on choices like contact form , cylindrical almost complex structure and coherent abstract perturbations but also on the chosen differential forms @xmath84 and coherent collections of sections @xmath72 used to define gravitational descendants .",
    "the main application of these equations we have in mind is the computation of the sequence of commuting quantum hamiltonians @xmath155 on sft homology @xmath156 introduced in the last section .      in order to prove the desired equations we will start with special non - generic choices of coherent collections of sections in the tautological bundles @xmath79 over all moduli spaces @xmath64 .",
    "+ the first assumption we will make is about the choice of sections in the tautological line bundles @xmath157 over the simplest moduli spaces @xmath158 of orbit cylinders with one marked point . observing that @xmath157 has a natural trivialization by canonically identifying @xmath159 with the target reeb orbit @xmath24 and the bundle itself with the cotangent bundle to @xmath160",
    ", we want to assume that the section in @xmath157 is constant in this trivialization . +",
    "this choice has a nice consequence .",
    "for this consider the generic fibre @xmath161 of the forgetful fibration @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is a marked , punctured riemann surface and @xmath164 is the holomorphic map to @xmath7 .",
    "such fibre is isomorphic to @xmath165 , where @xmath165 is the compact riemann surface with boundary obtained from @xmath163 by compactifying each puncture to a circle , which itself corresponds to a copy of the moduli space @xmath159 of cylinders over the corresponding reeb orbit via the boundary gluing map .",
    "+ now observe that the restriction of @xmath166 to the fibre @xmath167 coincides with the cotangent bundle to @xmath167 away from the marked points .",
    "a section can be then pulled back to @xmath166 from the cotangent bundle itself using coordinate identification away from the marked points , where the section developes a pole of degree one .",
    "this means that a smooth section can be chosen to have a zero of index @xmath168 at the marked points . with our assumption on the section in @xmath157 over each moduli space @xmath159",
    "we then guarantee that a coherent smooth section of @xmath166 , when restricted to @xmath167 , also has a singular point of index @xmath168 at the punctures . in order to see this ,",
    "observe that the gluing map at the punctures indeed agrees with the identification of @xmath157 with the cotangent bundle to @xmath160 .",

    "+ in the very same way as in the proof of the comparison formula in gromov - witten theory , it follows that in sft we can indeed choose a collection of sections @xmath175 in such a way that , for their zero set , we have @xmath176 where here the sum in the right hand side means union with the submanifold @xmath174 , transversally intersecting @xmath177 .",
    "+ the existence of such a choice of non - generic sections follows , as in gromov - witten theory , from the fact that the pullback bundle @xmath178 agrees with the tautological bundle @xmath79 away from the submanifold @xmath174 in @xmath64 , together with the fact that the restriction of @xmath79 to @xmath174 is trivial and that the normal bundle to @xmath174 agrees with @xmath179 .",
    "notice that such a choice of sections is intrinsically non - generic , the sets @xmath180 not being smooth , but union of smooth components intersecting transversally .",
    "+ we now prove that such sections can be chosen to form a coherent collection .",
    "assume we already proved that the above choice forms a coherent collection for all the moduli spaces with up to @xmath181 marked points . starting with a section of such collection on @xmath182 , we construct a section on @xmath183 with the above configuration of zeros by first pulling back @xmath184 to @xmath185 and then use the bundle map between @xmath178 and @xmath79 induced by a local coordinate on the underlying curve .",
    "such map , as we already noticed , is a bundle isomorphism on @xmath185 and becomes singular on @xmath174 : the image of @xmath186 under this map extends to the whole @xmath183 assuming the value zero on @xmath174 .",
    "the zero appearing this way along @xmath174 has degree @xmath187 by the above considerations .",
    "moreover the section is automatically coherent , not only at the boundary components which are preimage under @xmath162 of boundary components of @xmath182 , but also at the extra boundary components appearing in the fibre direction , which are always disjoint from @xmath174 .",
    "notice also that such construction works because any codimension @xmath187 boundary of the moduli space @xmath20 decomposes into a product of moduli spaces where the factor containing the @xmath67-th marked point carries the same well defined projection map @xmath188 .",
    "this is because codimension @xmath187 boundary strata are always formed by non - constant maps , which remain stable after forgetting a marked point . + the base of such induction process is given by any coherent collection of sections for the moduli spaces @xmath189 with only one marked point , the @xmath67-th , carrying the psi - class .",
    "+ in fact coherence also requires that our choice of coherent collection of sections is symmetric with respect to permutations of the marked points ( other than the @xmath67-th , carrying the descendant ) . indeed , reiterating the construction until we forget all of the marked points but the @xmath67-th , we get easily @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the submanifold of nodal curves with a constant sphere bubble carrying the marked points labeled by indices in @xmath192 .",
    "such choice of coherent collections of sections is indeed symmetric with respect to permutation of the marked points . + in order to be able to speak about higher powers @xmath193 of the psi - classes , we will need to select @xmath194 coherent collections of sections @xmath195 , @xmath196 , intersecting transversally . the descendant moduli space @xmath197",
    "will then be given by the intersection of their zero loci .",
    "we can start from the above special non - generic choice and perturb it ( preserving coherence ) to @xmath198 and @xmath195 , @xmath199 such that the following formula holds .",
    "@xmath200 notice that , as in gromov - witten theory , deducing this from the comparison formula ( [ comparison ] ) is possible again because the restriction of @xmath79 to @xmath174 is trivial .",
    "+ before we can use these special choices of coherent collections of sections to prove the sft analogues of the string , dilaton and divisor equations , we however finally have to make a short comment on the genericity of our special choices .",
    "+ recall that for the definition of gravitational descendants in @xcite we need to choose sections in the tautological bundles over all moduli spaces which are generic in the sense that they are transversal to zero section , so that , in particular , all zero divisors are smooth .",
    "on the other hand , as we outlined above , all our special choices of coherent collections of sections are automatically non - generic , since their zero sets localize on nodal curves and , in particular , are not smooth . + in order to see that we can still use our special non - generic choices for computations , we have to make use of the fact that , by using small perturbations , the special non - generic choice of coherent collections of sections can be approximated arbitrarily close ( in the @xmath201-sense ) by generic coherent collections of sections .",
    "while for two different coherent collections of sections the hamiltonian in general depends on these choices as for a given homotopy ( coherent collection of sections coherently connecting the two different choices in the sense of @xcite ) zeroes may run out of the codimension - one boundaries of the moduli spaces , we can further make use of the fact that the latter can be prevented from happening as long as the perturbation is small enough , see also the picture below",
    ". indeed , assuming by genericity that the original section @xmath202 has no zero on the boundary and denoting by @xmath203 the minimal absolute value of @xmath202 on the boundary , it is easily seen that every section @xmath204 in the homotopy has no zero on the boundary as long as @xmath205 .",
    "+        similarly to what happens for the gluing formulas for holomorphic curves in floer theory ( e.g. in @xcite ) , it then follows that the new hamiltonians defined using these generic coherent collections of sections agree with the hamiltonian defined using the original non - generic choices as long as the approximation error is sufficiently small , which in the gluing picture corresponds to the case of very large gluing parameter .      as customary in gromov - witten theory we will assume that the chosen string of differential forms on @xmath3 contains a two - form @xmath206 . since by adding a marked point we increase the dimension of the moduli space by two , the integration of a two - form over it leaves the dimension unchanged and we can expect , as in gromov - witten theory , to compute the contributions to sft hamiltonian involving integration of @xmath206 in terms of contributions without integration , where the result should just depend on the homology class @xmath19 which can be assigned to the holomorphic curves in the corresponding connected component of the moduli space .",

    "since the generic fiber is a smooth curve with @xmath273 holes and since , by our proper choice of sections for @xmath157 on the simplest moduli space of orbit cylinders with one marked point , coherence at such holes is equivalent to closing the holes and imposing an extra pole there , we can argue in the very same way as in gromov - witten theory .",
    "+ finally we would need to separately consider the cases where the forgetful fibration @xmath162 is not defined : as in gromov - witten theory only constant curves of genus one with one marked point might give a contribution , but in sft such moduli space has virtual dimension one and we hence get no contribution by index reasons . translating this into differential operators on the hamiltonian yields the desired equation .",

    "+ indeed , additivity of the euler characteristic with respect to gluing straightforwardly shows that @xmath274 satisfies the leibniz rule , that is , as in the proof of the divisor equation we have the two identities @xmath279={\\operatorname{\\mathbf{d}}}_{\\mathrm{euler}}[{\\operatorname{\\mathbf{h}}},{\\operatorname{\\mathbf{h } } } ] = 0,\\ ] ] so that @xmath280)$ ] , and , if @xmath148 is the potential for the cobordism connecting the different choices of auxiliary data , @xmath281 which implies as before @xmath282 .",
