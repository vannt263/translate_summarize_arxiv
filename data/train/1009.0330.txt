    "<S> ( note that for @xmath65 one exits the one - channel regime : for low fields the first ll energy is smaller than the chemical potential chosen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : two ] . ) in region i the oscillations in @xmath52 are rather clear and regular , while in region ii the conductance increases and then remains essentially large and constant for strong magnetic fields ( modulo sharp fano - like resonances ) . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) comparing the data in panel b ) with those in panel a ) , we notice that a larger gauge field produces more regular and well - defined oscillations , but with smaller amplitude . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : one]c ) ] , by introducing new dispersive branches which correspond to snake modes propagating along the interface . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the gauge field has a crucial role in breaking the symmetry between the two valleys , as it generates a downward bending in the first ll subband of the @xmath43 valley , say , without modifying the same ll in the @xmath44 valley .     </S>",

    "<S> again , for small values of @xmath42 we find ordinary edge states with a guiding center that moves from the left side of the auxiliary system towards the center . </S>",
    "<S> this is then converted into a snake state which approaches the interface asymptotically . </S>",
    "<S> it is crucial to observe that the  centers \" of the two snake states corresponding to the two valleys are _ not _ superimposed but are instead displaced by a finite amount . finally , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : three]d ) we have plotted the wave - function @xmath77 of the states belonging to the first ll . </S>",
