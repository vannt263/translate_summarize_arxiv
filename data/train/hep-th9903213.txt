    "it is a well - known fact that , while string perturbation theory in intersecting d - brane backgrounds is discussed in terms of localized branes@xcite , classical supergravity solutions representing such localized branes are typically difficult to construct .",
    "one often works with supergravity solutions where the branes are less well localized than one might like , and in fact have extra translational symmetries @xcite - @xcite ; see @xcite for a thorough review .",
    "one says that the branes have been ` smeared ' over some of the directions that were , a priori , transverse to their world volume . in some cases , with a bit more work",
    ", one can construct explicit fully localized solutions , at least in the ` near - core ' limit @xcite .",
    "however , there are some situations where fully localized supergravity solutions of the desired type simply do not exist .",
    "this happens when the world volume of one type of brane ( b ) is contained inside that of another ( a ) , or inside the volume through which brane a has been smeared , and when the branes intersect on a manifold of sufficiently low dimension ; the details will be explained below .",
    "if the branes are separated in a direction transverse to both types ( a and b ) , then localized solutions exist .",
    "nonetheless , as the transverse separation between the branes is removed , the type b brane delocalizes .",
    "this phenomenon does not occur when the dimension of the intersection manifold is sufficiently high .",
    "this delocalization was studied in @xcite for one - branes parallel to five - branes . as discussed there , this effect is related to a black hole no - hair theorem .",
    "black hole no - hair results tell us that , in certain cases , black hole horizons must be uniform .",
    "a pertinent example occurs in einstein - maxwell theory : when an electric charge @xmath0 is brought near a black hole , the charge @xmath0 appears to be delocalized over the black hole horizon @xcite .",
    "the situation discussed below is similar as , when delocalization occurs , the charge of the type b brane appears to be delocalized over the entire horizon of the type a brane . for such cases , the type a branes are ` bald ' and unable to support such hair .",
    "now , recall that there are certain dualities between supergravity and brane gauge theories , as in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite and its @xmath1-brane generalizations @xcite ; see also e.g. @xcite .",
    "the general picture of a duality is that there is a single quantum theory which has several distinct classical limits . in our case",
    ", one of these limits would give classical supergravity while the other would give classical brane gauge theory .",
    "this means that aspects of the dynamics which are classical from the point of view of one theory correspond to strongly quantum mechanical effects in terms of the other .",
    "we will further generalize the ads / cft limit to describe interacting a and b branes , and we will see that the delocalization of classical supergravity corresponds to large fluctuations of a modulus field on the gauge theory side .",
    "in particular , its occurrence is related to the quantum mixing between phases and the lack of superselection sectors associated with the asymptotic values of massless fields in low dimensional quantum field theories ; i.e. , on the gauge theory side , delocalization is controlled by the coleman - mermin - wagner theorem@xcite .",
    "the relevant quantum mixing is between the gauge theory phase which describes type a branes separated from type b branes in an overall transverse direction , which we will refer to generally as the ` separated ' branch , and the phase that describes such branes with no transverse separation , which we call the ` coincident ' branch that some correspondence of this sort should occur was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the consistency of this picture will be explained in section [ ift ] .",
    "we will see that , not only will this interpretation successfully predict the cases for which the type b branes delocalize , it will also give the correct rate at which the delocalization occurs as the transverse separation is removed .    before progressing to the main paper ,",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile to display an explicit and tractable example of the supergravity delocalization phenomenon .",
    "it turns out that this is much easier to see for a d - instanton located near a d3-brane than for the systems studied in @xcite .",
    "the point is that the classical supergravity solution for a localized bps d - instanton in ads@xmath2s@xmath3 is known in terms of elementary functions @xcite while , for the other examples , the supergravity solution is known only as a ( convergent ) infinite series .",
    "the near d3-brane geometry is just ads@xmath4s@xmath3 . for simplicity , we take the case @xcite where the d - instanton is smeared over the s@xmath3 , but the solution localized on the s@xmath3 is also known explicitly @xcite . by writing the ads@xmath4s@xmath3 metric in poincar coordinates , @xmath5 we may interpret the solution of @xcite as the near - core part of an asymptotically flat ( euclidean ) spacetime with a spherical ( s@xmath3 ) shell of d - instantons located near the three - branes . in ( [ metric ] ) , @xmath6 is the radius of the ads@xmath7 and of the s@xmath3 . in the presence of the d - instantons , the ( einstein ) metric",
    "is unchanged , and the dilaton is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9,\\ ] ] with @xmath10 the location of the d - instantons .",
    "this setup allows a separation between the d - instantons and the origin of ads@xmath7 .",
    "note that far from the d - instantons @xmath11 tends to a finite and nonzero constant , @xmath12 .",
    "the constant @xmath13 is arbitrary while the constant @xmath14 is proportional to the instanton charge .",
    "consider now the limit in which the instantons are moved onto the three - brane ; that is , the limit in which @xmath15 with fixed @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath17 should also remain fixed as we wish to examine the solution at a given location relative to the three - brane . in this limit , ( [ d ] )",
    "diverges so that we have @xmath18 therefore the dilaton is now constant ( and it is in fact the same constant as the asymptotic value of @xmath11 at generic d - instanton position ) . in particular , the solution no longer has any dependence on the coordinates @xmath19 along the three - brane .",
    "we see that the d - instantons have delocalized as they were moved toward the three - brane .",
    "note that this does not happen suddenly at @xmath20 , but rather gradually .",
    "as viewed from a fixed point relative to the three - brane , the field created by the instantons smoothly blurs out as we decrease @xmath21 to zero . in this context",
    ", we see that our delocalization is related to the well - known scale / radius duality of this system @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the d - instanton solution @xcite that is localized on the s@xmath3 as well as in the ads@xmath7 is similar .",
    "much the same behavior was seen in @xcite for a localized one - brane as it is moved onto a localized five - brane and , as we will see below , it occurs in many other cases as well .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sugrav ] ,",
    "we extend the analysis of @xcite to consider the full range of two charge intersecting brane solutions whose mathematical form is similar to that of the localized d1-branes parallel to d5-branes ( d1@xmath22d5 ) .",
    "for example , the analysis includes the localized d0@xmath22d4 system , and the d2@xmath22d6 system studied in @xcite .",
    "we will see that the d0@xmath22d4 system delocalizes as does the d1@xmath22d5 system , but that the same methods find the d2@xmath22d6 system to remain localized .",
    "this is a useful check of the method and resolves the apparent conflict . ] between the results of @xcite for the d1@xmath22d5 system and the explicit construction of the localized d2@xmath22d6 solutions in @xcite .",
    "the d2@xmath22d6 system is simply different from the d1@xmath22d5 system , in a way that will be discussed below .",
    "other solutions considered below are similar to a d1-brane orthogonally intersecting a d3-brane , where ( say ) the d1-brane is smeared along the d3-brane world volume . in this case",
    ", we will see that when the transverse separation between a ( localized ) d3 brane and the smeared d1 branes is removed , the d3 brane delocalizes along the d1-brane world volume . to be quite general",
    ", we will allow arbitrary transverse separation between the two types of branes , although we will still refer to these solutions as ` intersecting ' brane spacetimes .",
    "for many of these systems , certain ` near - core ' solutions were constructed in @xcite ; we argue in appendix [ y ] that , while these are certainly valid solutions to the supergravity equations , due to the subtleties of boundary conditions they are not the appropriate ones to consider in our context .    after studying the supergravity solutions",
    ", we turn in section [ ift ] to a discussion of the corresponding intersection field theories and the appropriate ads / cft limit @xcite .",
    "we will see that our delocalization phenomenon ( when it occurs ! ) corresponds to a quantum mixing between phases of the yang - mills theory and to the fact that 0 + 1 and 1 + 1 field theories are not superselected by the asymptotic values of the massless fields .",
    "finally , we discuss a few remaining issues in section [ disc ] .",
    "here , we consider bps solutions with two types of branes , a and b , each localized at fixed , but different , values of isotropic coordinates @xmath23 which label the space transverse to both branes .",
    "that is , we consider bps solutions with the branes separated in the transverse direction .",
    "the branes may carry ramond - ramond or neveu - schwarz  neveu - schwarz charge in type iia / b string theory or be m - branes , and the a- and b - branes need not be of the same sort . for example , the type a brane may be r - r while the type b branes are ns - ns .",
    "thus , we include the case of a fundamental string intersecting ( but not ending on ) a d - brane .",
    "the equations of motion for all of these cases have a similar structure as they are related by t- and s- duality .",
    "a similar analysis also applies to kaluza - klein monopoles and various sorts of waves . in this section",
    ", we refer to all such cases as ` branes . '",
    "the world - volumes of the type a and b branes will in general have certain directions in common .",
    "we label the directions common to both by coordinates @xmath24 . here",
    ", the @xmath25 is a label denoting the ` intersection ' directions .",
    "similarly , we denote by @xmath26 the worldvolume directions of brane a not in i , and we denote by @xmath27 the worldvolume directions of brane b not in i. we take brane a to be smeared in the @xmath27 directions , as well as in any directions in which brane b has been smeared .",
    "we will have no need to refer explicitly to directions in which both branes have been smeared , as these can be removed by a t - duality symmetry transformation , but we label directions in which brane a ( but not b ) has been smeared by @xmath28 .",
    "finally , @xmath23 labels directions orthogonal to both branes along which neither brane has been smeared .",
    "our conventions are conveniently summarized by the following table , where ( @xmath29 ) denotes a direction along a brane , ( @xmath30 ) denotes a direction in which a brane has been smeared , and an empty space denotes a direction orthogonal to the brane in which it has not been smeared .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are @xmath31 of the @xmath23 , @xmath32 of the @xmath26 , and @xmath33 of the @xmath27 . without loss of generality",
    ", we have chosen the d@xmath34-branes to be smeared over the @xmath27 . if there are no @xmath27 , then the intersection is parallel , otherwise it is orthogonal .",
    "in addition , we take any smeared configuration to be irreducibly smeared in the sense that it can not be reduced via a t - duality symmetry transformation to an unsmeared configuration .",
    "we work in the large - volume limit , @xmath35 , but we keep a finite charge density of the a - branes , @xmath36 . in contrast , the charge density @xmath37 .",
    "our analysis therefore differs from the special case considered in @xcite in which there was a volume infinity of d - instantons on d3-branes .",
    "it also differs from previous analyses such as @xcite where ads / cft for smeared intersecting branes was studied .",
    "let us now study our intersecting brane supergravity solutions from section [ sugrav ] in a generalization of the low - energy limit of @xcite .",
    "our concern is to find the relevant region of the supergravity geometry . if the d@xmath34-branes and d@xmath38-branes are very far from each other , then each has its own near - horizon region as if the other collection of branes did not exist .",
    "the more interesting , and new , situation arises when the branes influence each other strongly , i.e. when the separation @xmath39 is near - horizon in a sense which we now explain . in this section",
    ", we keep the localization in the @xmath40-sphere explicit , and do not use spherical shells .    an important subtlety in determining the low - energy limit for intersecting d - branes concerns the kind of probe we will use to connect a gauge theory energy @xmath41 with a supergravity radius @xmath42 . as before , the most straightforward probes to consider are the stretched strings . in the intersecting brane geometry , with metric ( [ intbraneg ] ) , and ` harmonic ' functions @xmath43 , the only bps stretched strings are the ones running in the transverse ( @xmath23 ) directions .",
    "strings stretched in directions other than @xmath23 , for example tethering two clumps of b branes separated in a @xmath26 ( @xmath22 ) direction , are not bps ; a symptom of this is that they experience large warpage @xmath44 because of this warpage , the non - transverse strings are attracted to the a branes .",
    "so we will concentrate only on the transverse bps stretched strings in the following ; the dynamics for other types of probes is much more complicated and we will not discuss it . as a consequence ,",
    "when we take the low - energy limit , we perform the scaling of coordinates only in the transverse directions : @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath46 we hold the a - brane coupling @xmath47 fixed ; if @xmath48 we hold @xmath49 fixed . effectively , this means we are taking the ads / cft limit just as for the larger brane . in a sense , including",
    "the physics of the smaller brane is like a ` perturbation ' on this larger - brane ads / cft correspondence , although we are not in any way treating the smaller brane physics perturbatively .",
    "a simple example of this is the case of the d - instanton in the d3-brane near - horizon geometry which we discussed in the introduction ; however , for the examples with larger branes such as d1@xmath22d5 , the theory on the smaller branes is in fact dynamical .",
    "in addition , the intersecting brane gauge theories will decouple from the bulk as long as the branes are ` small enough ' ; here this means that there are more than three directions transverse to both branes .",
    "for the cases where there are only three , even though the metric does not have the same form as for a d6-brane , we can compute the curvature and hawking temperature and they turn out to behave as for sixbranes . therefore we suspect that holography is breaking down , i.e. that making predictions about the classical supergravity from the quantum brane field theory may be problematic .",
    "we will remark on these cases explicitly when we encounter them .",
    "now , doing the ads / cft scaling in @xmath23 and holding @xmath50 of the larger brane fixed gives the the near - horizon geometry of the d@xmath34-branes . that this is true no matter whether @xmath51 or @xmath48 can be seen as follows .",
    "from @xmath52 we find @xmath53 }          \\over{(v_b/\\ell_s^b)(\\ell_s u)^{4-b } } } = { { n_a}\\over{(v_b/\\ell_s^b)n_b } } { { \\left[g_s n_b ( \\ell_s u)^{b-3}\\right]}\\over{(\\ell_s u)^{4-a}}}.\\ ] ] recall that there are several constraints of our setup , such as asymptotic flatness of the intersecting brane solution , the smearing of the d@xmath34-branes over @xmath27 , and the fact that both intersecting d - branes live in either type iia or iib string theory . as a result",
    ", it is always true that @xmath54 if @xmath46 where we hold @xmath47 fixed , or @xmath55 if @xmath48 where we hold @xmath49 fixed .",
    "thus we see that , as previously advertised , in either case only the near - horizon part of @xmath56 remains .",
    "that this happens even for @xmath48 is due to the smearing of the a - branes over @xmath27 .    we now need to check whether the supergravity curvature and dilaton develop any additional strong coupling regions due to the presence of the b branes .",
    "first of all , we should not be tempted to just throw away the 1 in @xmath57 by analogy with what happened to @xmath56 .",
    "recall that in the infinite volume limit , we have @xmath58 at the location of the d@xmath34-branes for any value of @xmath39 , and that this provides a boundary condition which forces @xmath59 far from the d@xmath38-branes as well .",
    "( we also discussed this phenomenon explicitly for the @xmath60 example in the introduction . )",
    "we conclude that , far from the d@xmath38-branes , the geometry and dilaton are just as they were for the near - horizon d@xmath34-branes in isolation . thus , one expects that new strong coupling regions could arise only near the d@xmath38-branes .",
    "we examine this possibility now , though we need to treat the @xmath61 and @xmath62 cases separately .",
    "let us study @xmath61 first .",
    "for @xmath61 we go directly to the exact solution of the previous section . for all cases with potentials stronger than @xmath63 ,",
    "where we expect holography to hold , delocalization occurs , and the solution depends only on the @xmath64 overall transverse coordinates . for @xmath61 the solution is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the volume of the @xmath26 directions , and we have used the identity @xmath67 . since we do not have a ( @xmath66 ) volume infinity of d@xmath38-branes , we have just @xmath68 , everywhere . as a result ,",
    "the curvature and dilaton behave exactly as they would for the isolated d@xmath34-branes .",
    "we can therefore simply use our d@xmath34-brane intuition to tell us where the @xmath61 intersecting brane supergravity solution is valid .    at generic separations",
    "@xmath39 , the supergravity solution is complicated , and is not known in terms of elementary functions .",
    "we will instead use an approximation scheme to study the curvature . as usual , we consider d@xmath34-branes with worldvolume @xmath69 and d@xmath38-branes with @xmath70 .",
    "the supergravity equation of motion for @xmath56 is @xmath71 h_a = { { q_a}\\over { v_b } } \\delta({{x}}_\\perp)\\ ] ] i.e. the @xmath34-branes are all at @xmath72 .",
    "the near - horizon solution is @xmath73 where the @xmath74 appears because of the smearing of the d@xmath34-branes along the d@xmath38-branes .",
    "( recall that , in our low - energy limit , the 1 in @xmath56 has dropped out . )",
    "we chose the origin of coordinates such that the d@xmath38-branes are located at @xmath75 and at @xmath76 .",

    "over such a region , the function @xmath56 does not vary much , and we can approximate it by a constant in the equation for @xmath57 . after a change of coordinates ,",
    "@xmath80 we see that an approximate solution to the @xmath57 equation of motion is given by @xmath81^{(7-b)/2 }    } } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath82 is a solution of the @xmath83 version of ( [ eqws ] ) . in particular , @xmath82 is smooth at the location of the d@xmath38-branes , so that the singular term will dominate in this region . for convenience",
    ", we pretend that @xmath84 in order to borrow results from the familiar d@xmath38-brane metric , but our conclusions will not depend on this choice .",
    "now notice that the fields of the intersecting brane system do not depend on any of @xmath85 .",
    "we may therefore rescale these coordinates without affecting the supergravity physics . defining @xmath86",
    "the metric becomes @xmath87\\,.\\ ] ] with the metric near the d@xmath38-branes in the above form , the scalar curvature @xmath88 of the intersecting brane solution is easy to compute .",
    "we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the curvature of the d@xmath38-brane metric by itself . at large @xmath91 , this curvature is small everywhere , as we saw at the beginning of this section .",
    "the factor of @xmath92 only makes this conclusion stronger , by a factor @xmath93 .",
    "we also consider the dilaton .",
    "for the intersecting solution it is @xmath94 for small @xmath38 , this will become large near the d@xmath38-branes . for @xmath95 ,",
    "it will be damped by a power of @xmath56 .",
    "however , due to the change of coordinates above from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , @xmath57 is large over a range of @xmath96 that is larger than for the b - branes in isolation . for small b , the supergravity solution also breaks down near the d@xmath38-branes , over a range of @xmath98 that is significantly stretched relative to what occurs for the b - branes by themselves .",
    "if we were interested in the region where the dilaton were too large , we would switch to an s - dual description .",
    "however , the most important point for us follows from the observation of the previous section that we have @xmath59 far from the d@xmath38-branes .",
    "in fact , when the separation @xmath99 is small and if we do not have a volume ( @xmath66 ) infinity of d@xmath38-branes , @xmath57 approaches @xmath100 quite rapidly . now let us pick a point significantly further out than the d@xmath38-branes but close enough that it would lie inside the region of validity of the near - horizon supergravity solution for the d@xmath34-branes alone . then in the combined system",
    ", @xmath57 is close to 1 at this point , and the d@xmath38-branes do not affect the validity of the supergravity solution .",
    "the previous section then tells us that the delocalization is visible in this region , and also that , by adjusting parameters , we can make the delocalization arbitrarily large without placing the d@xmath38-branes in the strong - curvature region of the near-@xmath34-brane geometry .",
    "we conclude that delocalization is a reliable prediction in this intersecting brane spacetime , and so it should have a dual description in terms of the gauge field theory on the branes .      on the field theory side of our generalized correspondence we have the coupled field theory of the d@xmath34- and d@xmath38-branes .",
    "there are three sectors of open strings , the @xmath101 strings , the @xmath102 strings , and the @xmath103 strings .",
    "the action for this system in the low - energy limit at weak gauge couplings is well known ; it is t - dual to that for the d0@xmath22d4 system and has eight real supercharges .",
    "since the dimensions of the low - energy field theories for the @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 strings are all different , we need to know how the couplings scale relatively in the low - energy limit @xmath104 .",
    "the gauge couplings on the @xmath34- and @xmath38-clumps are built out of the same string theory parameters .",
    "let us study the expansion parameters @xmath50 closely .",
    "for the @xmath34-clump we have @xmath105 and for the @xmath38-clump @xmath106 now let us take the low - energy limit of a system of two clumps of branes , the d@xmath34-branes and the d@xmath38-branes , as we did in the previous subsection . in general the expansion parameters will develop a hierarchy for energies @xmath41 of similar order : @xmath107 we see that a large hierarchy arises because we are taking the low - energy limit @xmath108 .",
    "now recall the condition that we keep @xmath109 fixed for the bigger brane ; this would be @xmath47 for @xmath46 or @xmath49 for @xmath48 .",
    "therefore we see that the coupling of the smaller brane becomes much stronger than that of the larger one , @xmath110 this means that the physics on the bigger brane does not significantly influence the physics on the smaller brane .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the ads / cft decoupling of the bulk theory from the brane theory .",
    "so whenever we consider two intersecting branes , orthogonal or parallel , we need only study the gauge theory on the smaller brane and on the intersection , and we can ignore the physics on the bigger brane as it is essentially frozen out .",
    "the one exception occurs , of course , when @xmath111 , in which case the dynamics on both clumps of branes is equally relevant .",
    "now , for d@xmath1-branes with @xmath112 , we have from the formula for @xmath113 that the perturbative sym regime is the high - energy or ultraviolet regime @xcite .",
    "so in a wilsonian sense the sym description is the fundamental one .",
    "now , note that the dimension of the theory on the intersection for our intersecting d - brane configurations has an upper bound of @xmath114 .",
    "this happens because there are not enough dimensions of spacetime to have intersecting branes ( parallel or orthogonal ) which are asymptotically flat and which have an intersection theory with @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , even at strong coupling , we may rely on conclusions that follow from general properties of the field theory on the smaller branes ( with @xmath116 ) and on the intersection , such as locality and dimensionality . on the other hand , the sym physics on the @xmath117 worldvolume of @xmath118 branes is at best a low - energy effective field theory , and gets replaced in the uv by a more complicated theory which may not even be a local quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "taking into account our previous finding that the gauge physics is relevant only on the intersection or the smaller brane , or at worst on both clumps for the @xmath111 case , the only case where the fact that sym@xmath119 is not the uv theory might bother us is d4@xmath120d4(2 ) .",
    "in fact , since in this case we do not know the fully localized supergravity solution but only an irreducibly smeared one , we are in effect dealing with @xmath63 potentials .",
    "therefore , we suspect that holography may be breaking down for this particular case .",
    "we see that the strongly quantum mechanical coupled d@xmath34,d@xmath38 field theory describes the supergravity solution in the near-@xmath34-horizon regime .",
    "this concludes our discussion of the regime of validity of the gauge theory and its relation to the supergravity regime of validity .",
    "now we turn to the gauge theory considerations , with which we want to explain our previous supergravity results on ( de)localization .    in the supergravity section we saw",
    "( de)localization occur as we brought the b - branes in to the a - branes from finite transverse separation to zero separation .",
    "we now want to see how this happens from the field theory perspective . since the type a and b branes are initially separated , we are a priori on the ` separated ' branch of moduli space . for the d5@xmath22d1 ( and t - dual d4@xmath22d0 )",
    "case this is usually called the coulomb branch , and the ` coincident ' branch the higgs branch . now , if we were to integrate out the 1 - 5 strings to study the coulomb branch , we would find @xcite that the coulomb and higgs branches of moduli space are separated by an infinite distance and decouple . however , these 1 - 5 strings become light in the limit in which the separation between the a and b branes is removed , which is our situation of interest . in particular , in our setup",
    "we have kept the mass of such strings fixed relative to our gauge theory energy scale .",
    "thus , the moduli space is simply not sufficient to describe physics in the region of interest .",
    "an analogy to our ramond - ramond case is the s - dual situation of fundamental strings approaching n - s fivebranes .",
    "there , the infinite distance in moduli space corresponds to the infinite throat of the fivebrane .",
    "however , we know that this is no obstacle to a fundamental string reaching and crossing the fivebrane horizon . again",
    ", what one finds is that the moduli space approximation is simply not sufficient to describe this part of the dynamics . in the same way",
    ", there is no conflict between our picture and the results of @xcite ; a mixing between the coulomb and higgs branches is allowed in our setup of the ads / cft limit for the intersecting branes when the separation is small .",
    "let us consider in more detail the case of d@xmath100-branes ( b ) and d@xmath121-branes ( a ) , where on the higgs branch the relevant moduli are the scale sizes and orientations of the gauge instantons which represent the d1-branes in the d5-brane gauge theory .",
    "( there are also position moduli but they will not be important in the following . ) as we argued above , we expect a mixing between the coulomb and higgs branches as the separation goes to zero",
    ". we will use physics of the higgs branch to study delocalization , in an approximate sense , keeping in mind that the small mass of the 1 - 5 strings modifies the dynamics of the system at large length scales and thus provides an ir cutoff .",
    "now let us extract a length scale for instanton size fluctuations .",
    "the scale size and orientation for a single instanton form a 1 + 1 quantum field theory with a moduli space metric which is flat for @xmath122 , and with a coefficient @xmath123 in front of the lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath124 is associated with the fact that @xmath125 has dimensions of a length .",
    "that the metric is not renormalized at strong coupling is a consequence of the high degree of supersymmetry in this system ( it is hyperkhler ) . for large @xmath126 , there are roughly @xmath126 possible orientations for the instanton in gauge space , so we have @xmath127 where @xmath128 are appropriate infrared and ultraviolet cutoffs . now , since we take all energies low by comparison to the string scale as in ( [ lowen ] ) , @xmath129 .",
    "in addition , as above , the 1 - 5 strings have a mass @xmath42 which provides an ir cutoff .",
    "if there are @xmath130 separate instantons , the moduli space metric , although uncorrected , is not flat . what is important for our estimate is the normalization , which is the same as in the @xmath131 case .",
    "in addition , the instantons all fluctuate independently , and so we may expect the above rough estimate to carry over . to translate our estimate into the quantities used in the classical supergravity discussion , recall that @xmath132 and , since the a - brane is an unsmeared five - brane , @xmath133 . also , since we are holding @xmath134 fixed and @xmath135 is small , up to numbers of order one we may replace the @xmath136 coming from @xmath137 inside the logarithm with @xmath138 .",
    "we then have @xmath139 we see that this estimate matches the supergravity result .",
    "the story is similar for d@xmath140 branes approaching d@xmath141 branes . in that case",
    ", we have a 0 + 1 quantum field theory and the rms fluctuations will be proportional to @xmath142 , but @xmath143 .",
    "we find @xmath144 again , this matches the classical supergravity delocalization rate . the case of d3-branes and d - instantons",
    "is a bit degenerate , but one finds agreement with the classical supergravity results , and with scale - radius duality , by taking @xmath145 proportional to @xmath146 .",
    "we note that , for every case of intersecting ramond - ramond branes that falls within our framework , we have @xmath147 and the potential @xmath56 diverges no faster than @xmath148 .",
    "furthermore , an @xmath148 potential is always associated with a 0 + 1 dimensional intersection and an @xmath149 potential is always associated with a 1 + 1 dimensional intersection .",
    "similarly , cases where @xmath56 diverges only like @xmath150 or weaker correspond to @xmath151-dimensional or larger intersections , and both the quantum size moduli fluctuations in the brane gauge theory and the classical supergravity delocalization are small .",
    "( if the @xmath152 were compactified on a very large manifold , the above results hold in the infinite - volume limit , and so by continuity the ( de)localization results are essentially unchanged at large but finite volume .",
    "we will , however , avoid finite volumes so as to finesse additional phenomena that occur when the sizes of the compactified manifolds get too small near the core in the supergravity geometry . )",
    "therefore , we see agreement for both the parallel and orthogonal intersections .    in cases where @xmath153 i.e. the type a branes are smeared , their field theory is still @xmath154 dimensional , not @xmath155 dimensional .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to replace @xmath156 in the argument above for the delocalization rate with the volume density @xmath157 , as one may think of this case as having a large number , of order @xmath158 , of separate intersections .",
    "thus , an estimate of the instanton scale size fluctuations can always be made that agrees with the classical supergravity delocalization rate .",
    "let us lastly consider the qualitatively different kinds of solutions we get by additionally smearing the type a branes along the @xmath28 direction . in the classical supergravity , we have a localized solution if only three transverse dimensions are left unsmeared .",
    "this is hard to explain from the field theory perspective , as can be seen by considering a prototypical example of the d0-clump with a d4-clump smeared along two of the five transverse dimensions .",
    "then the smeared d4-clump gives rise to a @xmath63 potential and the supergravity solution localizes , even though the intersection is @xmath159 dimensional .",
    "now , recall that holography for the d6-brane system is problematic . for the d4-brane smeared over two transverse directions",
    ", we have a @xmath63 potential and so we suspect that holography is breaking down for this twice - smeared d4-brane as well . in this sense ,",
    "our success in getting the classical supergravity answer for the d6@xmath22d2(2 ) and d4@xmath120d4(2 ) systems from the quantum brane gauge theory is surprising . on the other hand",
    ", it may simply be that smearing one brane and not the other is not a straightforward operation from the field theory perspective .",
    "note also that when the d@xmath141-branes are smeared over only one transverse direction , instead of two , the quantum theory on the branes and the classical supergravity agree that delocalization should occur , but do not agree with regard to the rate at which this happens .",
    "we would like to add a few more comments on the cases involving orthogonal intersecting branes , and how to use our earlier results to say something about asymptotically flat , as opposed to near - horizon , spacetimes .",
    "recall that the intersection field theory description is dual to the near - horizon supergravity description .",
    "as such , it does not directly say anything about the asymptotically flat solutions .",
    "however , the near - horizon and asymptotically flat supergravity solutions are controlled by the same equations of motion ( [ a],[b ] ) .",
    "the only difference is in the boundary conditions imposed on @xmath56 ; the boundary conditions on @xmath57 are identical for both cases .",
    "thus the two supergravity solutions must agree to high accuracy in the region @xmath160 .",
    "thus , if the near - horizon geometry is delocalized , there must also be a region ( perhaps , only for @xmath160 ) in which the asymptotically flat geometry is delocalized as well .",
    "we saw this explicitly for the solutions exhibited in section [ sugrav ] , in which the type a branes were initially smeared over the @xmath27 directions .",
    "the same conclusion should hold in the case without the initial smearing , for which the supergravity solutions are not yet known . for initial progress toward constructing these solutions , see @xcite .",
    "let us now consider as a prototype of orthogonal intersections the d2@xmath120d2(0 ) system .",
    "initially , for clarity , we refrain from smearing the a - branes over the b - brane world - volume . in the quantum gauge field theory ,",
    "the instanton scale sizes become blowup modes of the orthogonally intersecting d2-branes . to see this ,",
    "write each pair of spatial worldvolume coordinates as a complex coordinate @xmath161 , then for the combined worldvolumes we get the holomorphic curve @xmath162 .",
    "the smearing of @xmath125 is infinite because the field theory on the intersection is only @xmath159 dimensional .",
    "this means that the corresponding near - horizon geometry will also be smeared .",
    "we now use the above argument about matching supergravity solutions and our knowledge of the blowup modes in the near - horizon case to draw some conclusions about delocalization in the asymptotically flat case .",
    "this solution should be delocalized , but perhaps only in some near - horizon region .",
    "a diagram giving our artistic impression of the asymptotically flat solution is included below .",
    "we can only conclude that delocalization must occur in the interior of the shaded region , which is the region inside a blowup mode that has expanded until it reaches the curve @xmath163 .",
    "this is consistent with our expectations that , far from the intersection , the solution should reduce to the known physics of a lone d2-brane clump .",
    "our delocalization has become a finite - sized ` neck ' of the supergravity solution .",
    "-0.0truein1.0truein    in the actual d2@xmath120d2(0 ) case studied in the previous section , the d2@xmath120d2(0 ) supergravity solution has the a - branes initially smeared over @xmath27 .",
    "the field theory on the intersection is still @xmath159 dimensional , and so we conclude that the b - branes delocalize over the full near - a - horizon spacetime . in considering the implications for the asymptotically flat solutions , we recall that the near - a - horizon region has been enlarged by smearing over @xmath27 .",
    "the figure below shows the result for three clumps of type a branes placed close enough to each other that their charge radii ( @xmath164 , indicated by dotted lines ) overlap . the full near - horizon region is the interior of the solid heavy line .",
    "thus , blowup modes near the center ( thin solid line ) are now allowed to be much larger while remaining inside the near - horizon region .",
    "when enough clumps are present to model a complete smearing of the type a branes , we may expect the field theory prediction to imply complete delocalization in the @xmath26 directions of the type b branes in the asymptotically flat solution as well as the near - a - horizon solution .",
    "-0.0truein1.0truein    we draw entirely analogous conclusions for the other orthogonally intersecting cases which have @xmath165 or @xmath166 dimensional intersections , such as the d1@xmath120d3(0 ) .",
    "the only case which can localize from the field theory perspective has a @xmath114 intersection , and this is d4@xmath120d4(2 ) .",
    "but since this has only three totally transverse coordinates it exerts a @xmath63 potential and its near - horizon supergravity solution is localized , so again we have agreement of the near - horizon supergravity and field theory . following our above argument , there will be asymptotically flat solutions in which both branes are localized , in addition to the known solutions where the a branes are initially smeared over the @xmath27 directions .",
    "we have seen that many supergravity solutions containing two types of branes ( a and b ) have the property that one of the branes ( b ) delocalizes when the transverse separation between the branes is removed .",
    "this happens when the world volume directions of the type b brane are contained in the world volume directions of the type a brane , or in directions in which the type a brane has been smeared , and when the dimension of the intersection manifold is sufficiently small .    in terms of the corresponding brane gauge theories ,",
    "this phenomenon is associated with the lack of a sharp transition between the ` separated ' and ` coincident ' branches in the limit where the separation between the branes is very small .",
    "it is also associated with the fact that the asymptotic values of massless fields do not label superselection sectors in 0 + 1 and 1 + 1 dimensions ; i.e. , with the coleman - mermin - wagner theorem @xcite . in particular , the supergravity delocalization is related to large fluctuations of some size moduli fields in the ` coincident ' branch of the super yang - mills theory . as mentioned in @xcite , the classical delocalization",
    "is closely related to the black hole no - hair ` theorems ' , recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "it is rather amusing to connect such a classic feature of black hole physics with quantum fluctuations in the super yang - mills theory . up to subtleties discussed in section iii ,",
    "we find agreement both with respect to which cases should delocalize and with respect to the rate at which this delocalization occurs as the transverse separation between the branes is removed .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand in detail exactly why this rate agrees so well .",
    "we have also seen this delocalization to be in accord with expectations that there should in fact exist orthogonal intersecting brane supergravity solutions with _ both _ branes ( a and b ) localized in the directions along the other brane . in this case",
    ", our delocalization phenomenon may become a finite neck of the supergravity solution of the sort that is seen @xcite in the born - infeld description of intersecting branes .",
    "thus , when the intersection manifold is 0 + 1 or 1 + 1 dimensional , we expect only solutions with necks of some minimum finite size while , for higher dimensional cases we expect solutions with necks of all finite sizes ( including zero ) .",
    "there were , however , some cases that we were not able to analyze properly . in some of these cases , the type a brane has been smeared so that it covers a 6 + 1 dimensional volume .",
    "the corresponding spacetime then resembles , to a certain extent , that of a d6-brane and the brane gauge theory may not properly decouple from the bulk .",
    "we were therefore unable to rely on holography to draw conclusions about the classical supergravity from the quantum gauge theory .",
    "nonetheless , we found agreement for the d2@xmath22d6 and d4@xmath120d4(2 ) cases , and we would like to understand why this happened .    as mentioned in @xcite , bps supergravity solutions for many three- ( and higher)-charge solutions",
    "can also be analyzed in this way .",
    "typically , when two of the charges are smeared , we can discuss localization of the third just as was done for the type b branes above .",
    "asymptotically flat situations of this type that involve only ramond - ramond branes include three sets of d@xmath167 branes , or three sets of d@xmath168 branes . in these cases ,",
    "the branes are again smeared over a 6 + 1-dimensional volume and we do not expect decoupling from the bulk",
    ".    other cases that could not be studied precisely include ns - ns objects .",
    "consider first the case of fundamental strings intersecting r - r branes . here , we are stymied by our lack of understanding of fundamental strings in r - r backgrounds .",
    "however , in the supergravity regime , either the curvature in string units or the dilaton becomes large near the core of the r - r branes .",
    "this suggests that the fundamental string will fluctuate significantly near the supergravity r - r branes , and that this should give rise to delocalization of the endpoint ( necking ) near the core of the r - r branes in analogy with our discussion of solutions describing d - strings intersecting a d3-brane .    for the case of d@xmath1-branes intersecting ns5-branes , where the intersection has @xmath169 space and one time dimension , we have little to say because we do not understand well enough the theory on the ns5-branes or the related theory on the intersection manifold .",
    "it may be described by some sector of the ns5 ` little string theory ' @xcite , but such a description is likely to require much more than a field theory .",
    "note that there are only @xmath168 directions transverse to both branes for any value of @xmath1 , so that the supergravity solutions , with one brane smeared over the other , will always be localized .",
    "there remains however , the annoying case of d4@xmath22d0 with the d4-branes smeared over one @xmath28 direction . here",
    ", our classical supergravity and quantum field theory analyses predict delocalization .",
    "but , despite the fact that the potential is @xmath149 and we expect holography to hold , the two descriptions disagree with regard to the rate at which this should happen .",
    "it appears that smearing just the d4 branes is a more subtle operation in the quantum brane gauge theory than the supergravity would have us believe .",
    "we would like to thank andrs gomberoff , akikazu hashimoto , david kastor , andy strominger , jennie traschen , and especially clifford johnson and nikita nekrassov , for useful discussions .",
    "in addition , we are extremely grateful to joe polchinski both for his patience and his valuable insight , and for explanations of several matters integral to section iiib . this work was supported in part by national science foundation grant no .",
    "phy94 - 07194 .",
    "d.m was supported in part by nsf grant no .",
    "phy97 - 22362 and funds from syracuse university .",
    "one potential confusion concerns the near - core solutions of @xcite . while they are valid solutions to the supergravity equations",
    ", we now argue that , due to the subtleties of boundary conditions , they are not the appropriate ones to consider in our context .    to discuss those solutions , it is necessary to recall some elements of their construction .",
    "the differential equations to be solved are just ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) in the regime @xmath170 under the assumption that no @xmath28 directions ( associated with smearing of the type a branes in directions transverse to the type b branes ) are present . in @xcite , @xmath135",
    "was set to zero .",
    "however , we will find it useful to keep @xmath135 nonzero and then study the limit in which it vanishes .",
    "following @xcite , we take the @xmath171 directions to be non - compact .",
    "we take the number of @xmath171 directions to be @xmath172 .",
    "we would like to have spherical symmetry in both the @xmath23 and @xmath171 directions so , as in section [ sugrav ] , we replace the fully localized type b brane with a spherical ( @xmath173 ) shell of source : @xmath174 .",
    "thus , we have spherical symmetry in both the @xmath171 and @xmath175 directions and the solution depends only on @xmath176 and @xmath177 .    in the region",
    "@xmath178 , @xcite uses a trick first introduced in @xcite and finds that the equation simplifies under a change of coordinates ( correcting a typographic error in @xcite ) : @xmath179 in terms of @xmath180 , the equation to be solved ( for @xmath181 ) may be written @xmath182 this equation may be solved by realizing that it is the analytic continuation ( to non - integer dimensions ) of laplace s equation on @xmath183 , in coordinates in which the @xmath184 symmetry is manifest . the closed form solutions of @xcite may be obtained by smearing out the source further over the @xmath185 sphere @xmath186 and taking the limit as @xmath187 .",
    "what is important to note is that , for @xmath188 , the coordinate transformation ( [ trans ] ) means that @xmath187 corresponds to taking @xmath135 to infinity .",
    "thus , the type b and a branes are not in fact being placed at the same location in space .",
    "one may verify that , near the type a branes , the solutions of @xcite for @xmath188 do not depend on the @xmath171 coordinates , and so in this sense are not localized solutions . the fact that , at a generic point in the spacetime , the solutions of @xcite do depend on @xmath171 is a reflection of the lack of an asymptotically flat region in the near - core spacetime : even though the type b branes have been taken to infinity , part of their field can still be seen .",
    "for the case @xmath189 , the coordinate transformation ( [ trans ] ) breaks down , but @xcite constructs a logarithmic solution to which similar remarks apply .",
    "we note that if one tries to use these methods to construct a localized solution ( for @xmath190 ) by taking @xmath191 , one takes the source to infinity in @xmath180 where it will have little impact . thus",
    ", this seems to reproduce the conclusion of section [ sugrav ] that the type b branes delocalize .",
    "however , the analysis is complicated by the nontrivial mapping of surfaces in @xmath192 space into @xmath193 space ."
