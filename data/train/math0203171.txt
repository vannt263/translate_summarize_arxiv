    "there is also a notion of _ strong ucp _",

    "the concepts of weak and strong ucp extend a fundamental property of analytic functions to _ some _ elliptic equations other than the cauchy ",
    "riemann equation , see also  [ s - ucp ] below .    up to now , ( almost )",
    "all work on ucp goes back to two seminal papers @xcite , @xcite by torsten carleman , establishing a carleman  type inequality ( cf .   our inequalities and below ) .",
    "in this approach , the difference between weak and strong ucp and the possible presence of more delicate non  linear perturbations are related to different choices of the weight function in the inequality , and to whether @xmath5estimates suffice or @xmath6 and @xmath7estimates are required .    there are different notions of operators of dirac type .",
    "we shall not discuss the original hyperbolic dirac operator ( in the minkowski metric ) , but restrict ourselves to the elliptic case related to riemannian metrics .",
    "recall that , if @xmath8 is a compact smooth riemannian manifold ( with or without boundary ) with @xmath9 , we denote by @xmath10 the bundle of clifford algebras of the tangent spaces . for @xmath11 a smooth complex vector bundle of clifford modules , the _ clifford multiplication",

    "actually , we may choose a local frame in such a way that @xmath23 for all @xmath24 .",
    "so , locally , we have @xmath25 it follows at once that the principal symbol @xmath26 is given by clifford multiplication with @xmath27 , so that any operator @xmath28 of dirac type is elliptic with symmetric principal symbol .",
    "actually , if the connection @xmath29 is _ compatible _ with clifford multiplication ( i.e. @xmath30 ) , then the operator @xmath28 itself becomes symmetric .",
    "we shall , however , admit non  compatible metrics . moreover , the _ dirac laplacian _",
    "@xmath31 has principal symbol @xmath32 given by the riemannian metric @xmath33 .",
    "so , it is scalar real ( i.e.  a real multiple of the identity ) and elliptic .",
    "our main motivation for investigating weak ucp for perturbed dirac equations is an application to gauge theory of 3manifolds .",
    "we outline briefly the context in which the question arises .",
    "witten floer homology is an invariant of 3manifolds defined as the homology of a morse  smale  witten complex for the chern",
    "dirac functional , defined on an infinite dimensional space of @xmath34connections and spinor sections .",
    "a detailed construction of seiberg  witten floer homology along with an analysis of its main properties is given in @xcite .",
    "several interesting analytical problem are connected to the construction of this invariant .",
    "one source of technical difficulties is finding a suitable perturbation theory for the functional , in order to have the morse ( or morse  bott ) condition for the critical points , and transversality of the spaces of flow lines .",
    "there are different ways of treating this problem .",
    "one possible approach is the one followed in @xcite .",
    "first one realizes that it is fairly easy to achieve transversality for the set of critical points of the chern",
    "dirac functional ( moduli space of gauge classes of 3dimensional seiberg ",
    "witten monopoles ) , while it is more difficult to achieve transversality for moduli spaces of flow lines .",
    "this observation leads to the idea of perturbing the functional just enough to achieve transversality at critical points , and then introducing a class of perturbation of the 4dimensional seiberg ",
    "witten monopole equations , which does not come from a perturbation of the functional .",
    "the perturbations constructed this way have to satisfy a certain list of properties @xcite , ensuring that the resulting moduli spaces of flow lines have the desired transversality properties , so that the boundary operator in the morse  smale ",
    "witten complex can be defined by a counting of flow lines .    in this approach ,",
    "all the perturbations can be chosen so that , in the seiberg  witten monopole equations , only the _ curvature equation _ is perturbed , while leaving the _ dirac equation _ unchanged .",
    "a class of perturbations with these properties was introduced by fryshov in @xcite .    though this approach is effective in providing a working definition of floer homology and in the proof of topological invariance ( in the equivariant case ) @xcite , it is very unnatural to use different perturbations for critical points and flow lines which do not come from a perturbation of the functional . moreover , with the perturbation defined by fryshov , it is hard to have good control of the effect on the equations when the underlying 3manifold is modified , for instance by stretching a long cylinder , as in problems related to cutting and pasting ( surgery formulae ) . in the interest of deriving formulae of this sort ,",
    "it is better to investigate other possible perturbation theories , which arise directly as perturbations of the chern  simons ",
    "dirac functional .",
    "a class of such perturbation was proposed by kronheimer in @xcite .",
    "since these affect both the curvature and the dirac equation , and are both non  local and non  linear , the question arises of how much delicate properties of the dirac operator , such as the unique continuation property , may be affected by the presence of perturbation .",
    "in particular , since the weak ucp plays a role in all the transversality arguments , this seems an important technical point that needs to be understood .",
    "this is the main point in our paper .",
    "we apply our elementary proof of weak ucp for perturbed dirac operators to a class of perturbations for seiberg ",
    "witten floer theory that combines the perturbations introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that a version of seiberg  witten floer theory that avoids the use of perturbations and deals directly with the resulting excess intersection was developed recently by manolescu @xcite",
    ".    * acknowledgment .",
    "* we thank hubert kalf for his generous help and many extremely useful comments and suggestions .",
    "clearly , not any arbitrary perturbation by a 0th order term preserves the _",
    "unique continuation property ( ucp ) _ as one can see by standard cases from first order ordinary differential equations , such as @xmath35 , or @xmath36 . with a little more work , it is possible to produce examples with non  uniqueness of _ smooth _ solutions .    in the affirmative ,",
    "weak ucp can be proved in the following case .",
    "[ t - main ] the weak ucp ( i.e. ucp from open subsets ) for solutions of a possibly tensored dirac equation @xmath37 on a smooth ( not necessarily compact ) manifold @xmath1 is preserved under perturbation with a non ",
    "linear and/or global term of 0th order of the form @xmath38 which can be estimated in the following way :    * @xmath39 with a real valued non  negative locally bounded function @xmath40 on @xmath1 .",
    "we review briefly three ways to prove theorem [ t - main ] .    [ [ section ] ]    we can replace the dirac operator by its square , the dirac laplacian . it has diagonal and real principal symbol .",
    "so we can apply the legendary parallel papers @xcite and @xcite by aronszajn and cordes .",
    "of course , in principle , a perturbation of a differential operator of first order by a 0th order term is essentially more delicate than a perturbation of a second order operator by 0th order . fortunately , the two mentioned papers admit non  linear perturbations of first order of precisely that type which our 0th order perturbation of the dirac operator will yield by squaring the perturbed operator .",
    "strictly speaking , aronszajn and cordes derived their results only for scalar equations and not for systems , but they mentioned that the proofs are similar for systems .",
    "moreover , it should be mentioned that these methods are extremely hard because the goal of the two famous papers was the strong ucp ( from a point ) . however , for the applications in seiberg  witten ",
    "floer theory , weak ucp suffices .",
    "finally , from a geometric point of view it seems inappropriate to destroy the beautiful geometric first  order structure of the dirac operator by squaring .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    for weak ucp , an alternative and much simpler proof was given by weck , @xcite for any first order system of generalized dirac type and a non  linear smooth perturbation satisfying the condition of theorem [ t - main ] .",
    "he transforms to a particular second order system and then establishes weak ucp for that system relatively easily .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    in the following we shall explain a third and completely direct proof method , where all arguments are carried out on the level of the perturbed dirac operator , without resorting to second order operators .",
    "first we recall some features of the direct proof of weak ucp for solutions of the dirac equation , given in @xcite and @xcite . later on we explain the modifications necessary to cover also the non  linear case .",
    "the weak ucp is one of the basic properties of an operator of dirac type @xmath41 . for @xmath42",
    ", it guarantees that there are no _ ghost _ solutions of @xmath43 , that is , there are no solutions which vanish on @xmath44 and have non  trivial support in the interior of @xmath45 .",
    "this property is also called ucp _ from open subsets _ or _ across any hypersurface_. for euclidean ( classical ) dirac operators ( i.e. , dirac operators on @xmath46 with constant coefficients and without perturbation ) the property follows by squaring directly from the well  established ucp for the classical ( constant coefficients and no potential ) laplacian .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) a very simple proof of the weak ucp for operators of dirac type is given , inspired by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 6 - 7 , in particular the proof of inequality ( 7.11 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section ii.3 ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a further slight simplification and a broader perspective .",
    "the proof does not use advanced arguments of the aronszajn / cordes type regarding the diagonal and real form of the principal symbol of the dirac laplacian , but only the following product property of dirac type operators ( besides grding s inequality , see remark [ r - gaarding ] ) .",
    "[ l - product ] let @xmath47 be a closed hypersurface of @xmath1 with orientable normal bundle .",
    "let @xmath48 denote a normal variable with fixed orientation such that a bicollar neighborhood @xmath49 of @xmath47 is parameterized by @xmath50\\times \\sigma$ ] .",
    "then any operator of dirac type can be rewritten in the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a self  adjoint elliptic operator on the parallel hypersurface @xmath53 , and @xmath54 a skew  symmetric operator of @xmath55th order , actually a skew  symmetric bundle homomorphism .",

    "let @xmath57 be a bundle homomorphism .",
    "then @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",

    "\\(b ) for operators of dirac type , it is well known that a perturbation by a bundle homomorphism is equivalent to modifying the underlying connection of the operator .",
    "this gives an alternative argument for the invariance of the form for operators of dirac type under perturbation by a bundle homomorphism .",
    "\\(c ) by the preceding arguments ( a ) , respectively ( b ) , establishing weak ucp for sections belonging to the kernel of a dirac type operator respectively an operator which can be written in the form implies weak ucp for all eigensections .",

    "the standard lines of the ucp literature can be radically simplified , namely with regard to the weight functions and the integration order of estimates . in section [ s - ucp ]",
